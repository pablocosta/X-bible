GNV	Matthew	5	17	[ i ] Think not that I am come to destroy the Law , or the Prophets . I am not come to destroy them , but to [ j ] fulfill them .

GNV	Matthew	5	28	But I say unto you , that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her , hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
GNV	Matthew	5	32	But I say unto you , whosoever shall put away his wife ( except it be for fornication ) causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced , committeth adultery .

GNV	Matthew	5	71	, which had the hearing of most weighty affairs , as the matter of a whole tribe or of an high Priest , or of a false prophet . - Matthew 5:22 Whereas we read here , Hell , it is in the text itself , Gehenna , which is an Hebrew word made of two , and is as much to say , as the Valley of Hinnom , which otherwise the Hebrews called Tophet : it was a place where the Israelites were wont most cruelly to sacrifice their children to false gods , whereupon it was taken for a place appointed to torment the reprobates in Jer . 7:31 . - Matthew 5:22 The Jews used four kinds of punishments , before their government was taken away by Herod , hanging , heading , stoning , and burning : this is it that Christ shot at , because burning was the greatest punishment , therefore in that he maketh mention of a judgment , a council , and a fire , he showeth that some sins are worse than other sins , but yet they are all such that we must give account for them , and will be punished for them . - Matthew 5:23 The covetous Pharisees taught that God was appeased by the sacrifices appointed in the Law , which they themselves devoured . But Christ on the contrary side denieth that God accepteth any man ’ s offering , unless he maketh satisfaction to his brother whom he hath offended : and saith moreover , that these stubborn and stiffnecked despisers of their brethren , shall never escape the wrath and curse of God , before they have made full satisfaction to their brethren . - Matthew 5:23 He applieth all this speech to the state of his time , when as there was an altar standing in Jerusalem , and therefore they are very foolish , that gather hereupon , that we must build altars , and use sacrifices : but they are more fools , which draw that to purgatory , which is spoken of peacemaking and atonement one with another . - Matthew 5:25 Cut off all cause for enmity . - Matthew 5:26 Thou shalt be dealt withall to the utmost extremity . - Matthew 5:27 He is taken for an adulterer before God , whatsoever he be , that coveteth a woman : and therefore we must keep our eyes chaste , and all the members we have , yea , and we must eschew all occasions which might move us to evil , how dear soever it cost us . - Matthew 5:29 He nameth the right eye and the right hand , because the parts of the right side of our bodies are the chiefest , and the readiest to commit any wickedness . - Matthew 5:29 Word for word , do cause thee to offend : for sins are stumbling blocks as it were , that is to say , rocks which we are cast upon . - Matthew 5:33 The meaning of the third commandment against the froward opinion and judgment of the Scribes , which excused by oaths or indirect forms of swearing . - Matthew 5:37 Whatsoever you vouch , vouch it barely , and whatsoever you deny , deny it barely without any more words . - Matthew 5:37 From an evil conscience , or from the devil . - Matthew 5:38 He showeth clean contrary to the doctrine of the Scribes , that the sum of the second table must be understood , that we may in no wise render evil for evil , but rather suffer double injury , and do well to them that are our deadly enemies . - Matthew 5:45 A double reason : the one is taken of relatives , that children must be like their father : the other is taken of comparison , The children of God must be better , than the children of this world . - Matthew 5:47 They that were the toll masters , and had the oversight of tributes and customs : a kind of men that the Jews hated to death , both because they served the Romans in these offices , ( whose yokeful bondage they could hardly away withall ) and also because these toll masters are for the most part given to covetousness .

GNV	Matthew	6	5	[ d ] And when thou prayest , be not as the hypocrites : for they love to stand and pray in the Synagogues , and in the corners of the streets , because they would be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , they have their reward .
GNV	Matthew	6	14	( D ) [ i ] For if ye do forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .

GNV	Matthew	6	24	( G ) [ o ] No man can serve [ p ] two masters : for either he shall hate the one , and love the other , or else he shall lean to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and [ q ] riches .
GNV	Matthew	6	25	( H ) [ r ] Therefore I say unto you , be not careful for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink : nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more worth than meat ? and the body than raiment ?
GNV	Matthew	6	33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness , and all these things shall be ministered unto you .
GNV	Matthew	6	2	( A ) Therefore when thou givest thine alms , thou shalt not make a trumpet to be blown before thee , as the [ c ] hypocrites do in the Synagogues and in the streets , to be praised of men . Verily I say unto you , they have their reward .
GNV	Matthew	6	3	But when thou doest thine alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth ,
GNV	Matthew	6	4	That thine alms may be in secret , and thy Father that seeth in secret , he will reward thee openly .
GNV	Matthew	6	7	Also when ye pray , use no [ e ] vain repetitions as the Heathen : for they think to be heard for their much babbling .
GNV	Matthew	6	8	Be ye not like them therefore : for your Father knoweth whereof ye have need , before ye ask of him .
GNV	Matthew	6	9	[ f ] After this manner therefore pray ye , ( B ) Our father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
GNV	Matthew	6	10	Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done even in earth as it is in heaven .
GNV	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day our [ g ] daily bread .
GNV	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors .
GNV	Matthew	6	13	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us ( C ) from [ h ] evil : for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory for ever . Amen .
GNV	Matthew	6	15	But if ye do not forgive men their trespasses , no more will your father forgive you your trespasses .
GNV	Matthew	6	17	But when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ,
GNV	Matthew	6	18	That thou seem not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret , will reward thee openly .
GNV	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
GNV	Matthew	6	22	¶ ( F ) [ m ] The light of the body is the eye : if then thine [ n ] eye be single , thy whole body shall be light .
GNV	Matthew	6	23	But if thine eye be wicked , then all thy body shall be dark . Wherefore if the light that is in thee , be darkness , how great is that darkness ?
GNV	Matthew	6	26	Behold the fowls of the [ s ] heaven : for they sow not , neither reap , nor carry into the barns , yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ?
GNV	Matthew	6	27	Which of you by [ t ] taking care is able to add one cubit unto his stature ?
GNV	Matthew	6	28	And why care ye for raiment ? Learn how the Lilies of the field do grow : they [ u ] are not wearied , neither spin :
GNV	Matthew	6	29	Yet I say unto you , that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
GNV	Matthew	6	30	Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which is today , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , shall he not do much more unto you , O ye of little faith ?
GNV	Matthew	6	31	Therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or what shall we drink ? or wherewith shall we be clothed ?

GNV	Matthew	7	24	[ o ] Whosoever then heareth of me these words , ( M ) and doeth the same , I will liken him to a wise man , which hath builded his house on a rock :
GNV	Matthew	7	26	But whosoever heareth these my words , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which hath builded his house upon the sand :
GNV	Matthew	7	2	For with what ( A ) judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged , and with what ( B ) measure ye mete , it shall be measured unto you again .
GNV	Matthew	7	3	And why seest thou the mote , that is in thy brother ’ s eye , and perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
GNV	Matthew	7	4	( C ) Or how sayest thou to thy brother , Suffer me to cast out the mote out of thine eye , and behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
GNV	Matthew	7	5	Hypocrite , first cast out that beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother ’ s eye .
GNV	Matthew	7	8	For whosoever asketh , receiveth : and he that seeketh , findeth : and to him that knocketh , it shall be opened .
GNV	Matthew	7	9	For what man is there among you , which if his son ask him bread , would give him a stone ?
GNV	Matthew	7	10	Or if he ask fish , will he give him a serpent ?
GNV	Matthew	7	11	If ye then , which are evil , can give to your children good gifts , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven , give good things to them that ask him ?
GNV	Matthew	7	12	( E ) [ e ] Therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do to you : even so do ye to them : for this is the [ f ] Law and the Prophets .

GNV	Matthew	9	2	And ( A ) lo , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy laid on a bed . And Jesus [ c ] seeing their faith , said to the sick of the palsy , Son be of good comfort : thy sins are forgiven thee .
GNV	Matthew	9	3	And behold , certain of the Scribes said with themselves , This man [ d ] blasphemeth .
GNV	Matthew	9	4	But when Jesus saw their thoughts , he said , Wherefore think ye evil things in your hearts ?
GNV	Matthew	9	6	And that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority in earth to forgive sins ( then said he unto the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go to thine house .
GNV	Matthew	9	7	And he arose , and departed to his own house .
GNV	Matthew	9	8	So when the multitude saw it , they marveled , and glorified God , which had given such authority to men .
GNV	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw that , they said to his disciples , Why eateth your Master with Publicans and sinners ?
GNV	Matthew	9	12	Now when Jesus heard it , he said unto them , The whole need not the Physician , but they that are sick .
GNV	Matthew	9	13	But go ye and learn what this is , ( C ) I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but the ( D ) sinners to repentance .
GNV	Matthew	9	14	¶ ( E ) [ h ] Then came the disciples of John to him , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft , and thy disciples fast not ?
GNV	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said unto them , Can the [ i ] children of the marriage chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them ? But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
GNV	Matthew	9	16	Moreover , no man pieceth an old garment with a piece of [ j ] new cloth : for that that should fill it up , taketh away from the garment , and the breach is worse .
GNV	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus arose and followed him with his disciples .
GNV	Matthew	9	21	For she said in herself , If I may touch but his garment only , I shall be whole .
GNV	Matthew	9	22	Then Jesus turned him about , and seeing her , did say , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole at that same moment . )
GNV	Matthew	9	23	[ l ] Now when Jesus came into the ruler ’ s house , and saw the [ m ] minstrels and the multitude making noise ,
GNV	Matthew	9	24	He said unto them , Get you hence : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
GNV	Matthew	9	25	And when the multitude were put forth , he went in and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
GNV	Matthew	9	26	And this bruit went throughout all that land .
GNV	Matthew	9	27	[ n ] And as Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , O son of David , have mercy upon us .
GNV	Matthew	9	29	Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
GNV	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened , and Jesus gave them great charge , saying , See that no man know it .
GNV	Matthew	9	31	But when they were departed , they spread abroad his fame throughout all that land .
GNV	Matthew	9	33	And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : then the multitude marveled , saying , The like was never seen in Israel .
GNV	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , ( H ) He casteth out devils , through the prince of devils .
GNV	Matthew	9	35	¶ And ( I ) Jesus went about all cities and towns , teaching in their Synagogues , and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
GNV	Matthew	9	36	[ p ] But ( J ) when he saw the multitude , he had compassion upon them , because they were dispersed , and scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .

GNV	Matthew	10	1	And ( A ) [ a ] he called his twelve disciples unto him , and gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every sickness , and every disease .
GNV	Matthew	10	5	These twelve did Jesus send forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into the cities of the Samaritans enter ye not :

GNV	Matthew	10	34	( R ) [ v ] Think not that I am come to send peace into the earth , but the sword .
GNV	Matthew	10	35	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .

GNV	Matthew	13	1	The ( A ) same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
GNV	Matthew	13	11	[ b ] And he answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
GNV	Matthew	13	34	¶ ( H ) All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables , and without parables spake he not unto them ,
GNV	Matthew	13	18	¶ ( E ) Hear ye therefore the parable of the Sower .
GNV	Matthew	13	24	¶ [ e ] Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which sowed good seed in his field .
GNV	Matthew	13	31	¶ ( F ) [ f ] Another parable he put forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed , which a man taketh and soweth in his field :
GNV	Matthew	13	33	¶ ( G ) Another parable spake he to them , The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman taketh and hideth in three pecks of meal , till all be leavened .
GNV	Matthew	13	44	¶ [ h ] Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hid in the field , which when a man hath found , he hideth it , and for joy thereof departeth , and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
GNV	Matthew	13	45	¶ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man that seeketh good pearls ,
GNV	Matthew	13	47	¶ [ i ] Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a draw net cast into the sea , that gathereth of all kinds of things .
GNV	Matthew	13	53	¶ And it came to pass , that when Jesus had ended these parables , he departed thence ,
GNV	Matthew	13	2	[ a ] And great multitudes resorted unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat down : and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
GNV	Matthew	13	3	Then he spake many things to them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow .
GNV	Matthew	13	4	And as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up .
GNV	Matthew	13	5	And some fell upon stony ground , where they had not much earth , and anon they sprung up , because they had no depth of earth .
GNV	Matthew	13	6	And when the sun was up , they were parched , and for lack of rooting withered away .
GNV	Matthew	13	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprung up , and choked them .
GNV	Matthew	13	8	And some again fell in good ground , and brought forth fruit , one corn an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , and another thirtyfold .
GNV	Matthew	13	9	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
GNV	Matthew	13	10	¶ Then the disciples came , and said to him , Why speakest thou to them in parables ?
GNV	Matthew	13	12	( B ) For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
GNV	Matthew	13	14	So in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah , which prophecy saith , ( C ) By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand , and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive .
GNV	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s heart is waxed fat , and their ears are dull of hearing , and with their eyes they have winked , lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their hearts , and should return , that I might heal them .
GNV	Matthew	13	16	[ c ] But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
GNV	Matthew	13	17	( D ) For verily I say unto you , that many Prophets , and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them , and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
GNV	Matthew	13	19	Whensoever any man heareth the word of that kingdom , and understandeth it not , that evil one cometh , and catcheth away that which was sown in his [ d ] heart : and this is he which hath received the seed by the way side .
GNV	Matthew	13	20	And he that received seed in the stony ground , is he which heareth the word , and incontinently with joy receiveth it ,
GNV	Matthew	13	21	Yet hath he no root in himself , and endureth but a season : for as soon as tribulation or persecution cometh because of the word , by and by he is offended .
GNV	Matthew	13	22	And he that received the seed among thorns , is he that heareth the word : but the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he is made unfruitful .
GNV	Matthew	13	23	But he that received the seed in the good ground , is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it , which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , and some thirtyfold .
GNV	Matthew	13	25	But while men slept , there came his enemy and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
GNV	Matthew	13	26	And when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
GNV	Matthew	13	27	Then came the servants of the householder , and said unto him , Master , sowest thou not good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
GNV	Matthew	13	28	And he said unto them , Some envious man hath done this . Then the servants said unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
GNV	Matthew	13	29	But he said , Nay , lest while ye go about to gather the tares , ye pluck up also with them the wheat .
GNV	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest , and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye first the tares , and bind them in sheaves to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
GNV	Matthew	13	32	Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and it is a tree , so that the birds of heaven come and build in the branches thereof .
GNV	Matthew	13	35	That it might be fulfilled , which was spoken by the Prophet , saying , ( I ) I will open my mouth in parables , and will utter the things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
GNV	Matthew	13	36	Then sent Jesus the multitude away , and went into the house . And his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of that field .
GNV	Matthew	13	37	[ g ] Then answered he , and said to them , He that soweth the good seed , is the son of man ,
GNV	Matthew	13	38	And the field is the world , and the good seed are the children of the kingdom , and the tares are the children of that wicked one .
GNV	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy that soweth them , is the devil , ( J ) and the harvest is the end of the world , and the reapers be the Angels .
GNV	Matthew	13	40	As then the tares are gathered and burned in the fire , so shall it be in the end of this world .
GNV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of man shall send forth his Angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ,
GNV	Matthew	13	42	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire . There shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
GNV	Matthew	13	43	( K ) Then shall the just men shine as the sun in the kingdom of their father . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
GNV	Matthew	13	46	Who having found a pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had and bought it .
GNV	Matthew	13	48	Which , when it is full , men draw to land , and sit and gather the good into vessels , and cast the bad away .
GNV	Matthew	13	49	So shall it be at the end of the world . The Angels shall go forth , and sever the bad from among the just ,
GNV	Matthew	13	50	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
GNV	Matthew	13	51	¶ [ j ] Jesus said unto them , Understand ye all these things ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
GNV	Matthew	13	52	Then said he unto them , Therefore every Scribe which is taught unto the kingdom of heaven , is like unto an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things both new and old .
GNV	Matthew	13	54	( L ) [ k ] And came into his own country , and taught them in their Synagogue , so that they were astonied , and said , Whence cometh this wisdom and great works unto this man ?
GNV	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter ’ s son ? Is not his mother called Mary , ( M ) and his brethren James and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
GNV	Matthew	13	56	And are not his sisters all with us ? Whence then hath he all these things ?
GNV	Matthew	13	57	And they were offended with him . Then Jesus said to them , ( N ) A Prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and in his own house .
GNV	Matthew	13	58	And he did not many great works there , for their unbelief ’ s sake . Footnotes - Matthew 13:2 Christ showeth in putting forth this parable of the Sower , that the seed of life which is sown in the world , cometh not on so well in one as in another , and the reason is , for that men for the most part either do not receive it , or suffer it not to ripen . - Matthew 13:11 The gift of understanding and of faith is proper to the elect , and all the rest are blinded through the just judgment of God . - Matthew 13:16 The condition of the Church under and since Christ , is better than it was in the time of the Fathers under the Law . - Matthew 13:19 Though there be mention made of the heart yet this sowing is referred to hearing without understanding . For whether the seed be received in the heart or no , yet he that soweth , soweth to the heart . - Matthew 13:24 Christ showeth in another parable of the evil seed mixed with the good , that the Church shall never be free and quit from offences , both in doctrine and manners , until the day appointed for the restoring of all things to come , and therefore the faithful have to arm themselves with patience and constancy . - Matthew 13:31 God beginneth his kingdom with very small beginnings , to the end that by the growing on of it , beside the expectation and hope of all men , his mighty power and working may be the more set forth . - Matthew 13:37 He expoundeth the former parable of the good and evil seed . - Matthew 13:44 Few men understand how great the riches of the kingdom of heaven are , and no man can be partaker of them , but he that redeemeth them with the loss of all his goods . - Matthew 13:47 There are many in the Church , which notwithstanding are not of the Church , and therefore at length shall be cast out : but the full and perfect cleansing of them is deferred to the last day . - Matthew 13:51 They ought to be diligent , which have not only to be wise for themselves , but to dispense the wisdom of God to others . - Matthew 13:54 Men do not only sin of ignorance , but also wittingly and willfully lay stumbling blocks in their own ways , that when God calleth them , they may not obey , and so most plainly destroy and cast away themselves .

GNV	Matthew	14	1	At ( A ) [ a ] that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus ,
GNV	Matthew	14	3	( B ) For Herod had taken John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ’ sake , his brother Philip ’ s wife .
GNV	Matthew	14	10	And sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
GNV	Matthew	14	13	( E ) And when Jesus heard it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart . And when the multitude had heard it , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
GNV	Matthew	14	18	And he said , Bring them hither to me .
GNV	Matthew	14	23	And as soon as he had sent the multitude away , he went up into a mountain alone to pray : and ( G ) when the evening was come , he was there alone .
GNV	Matthew	14	24	[ e ] And the ship was now in the midst of the sea , and was tossed with waves : for it was a contrary wind .
GNV	Matthew	14	28	[ h ] Then Peter answered him , and said , Master , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
GNV	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw a mighty wind , he was afraid : and as he began to sink , he cried , saying , Master , save me .
GNV	Matthew	14	36	And besought him , that they might touch the hem of his garment only : and as many as touched it were made whole . Footnotes - Matthew 14:1 Here is in John an example of an invincible courage , which all faithful Ministers of God ’ s word ought to follow : in Herod , an example of tyrannous vanity , pride and cruelty , and to be short , of a courtly conscience , and of their insufferable slavery , which have once given themselves over to pleasures : in Herodias and her daughter , an example of whore-like wantonness , and womanlike cruelty . - Matthew 14:2 By works he meaneth that force and power , whereby works are wrought and not the works , as is seen oft before . - Matthew 14:6 There were three Herods : the first of them was Antipater ’ s son , who is also called Ascalonius , in whose reign Christ was born , and he it was that caused the children to be slain . The second was called Antipas , Magnus his son , whose mother ’ s name was Malthace or Martaca , and this was called Tetrarch , by reason of enlarging his dominion , when Archelaus was banished to Vienna in France . The third was Agrippa , Magnus his nephew by Aristobulus , and he it was that slew James . - Matthew 14:14 Christ refresheth a great multitude with five loaves and two little fishes , showing thereby , that they shall want nothing , which lay all things aside and seek the kingdom of heaven . - Matthew 14:24 We must sail even through mighty tempests , and Christ will never forsake us , so that we go whither he hath commanded us . - Matthew 14:25 By the fourth watch is meant the time near to day breaking : for in old time they divided the night into four watches , in which they scouted . - Matthew 14:26 A spirit , as it is here taken , is that which a man imagineth to himself vainly in his mind , persuading himself that he seeth something , and seeth nothing . - Matthew 14:28 By faith we tread under our feet even the tempests themselves , but yet by the virtue of Christ , which helpeth that virtue , which he of his mercy hath given . - Matthew 14:34 This Gennesaret was a lake nigh to Capernaum , which is also called the Sea of Galilee , and Tiberias , so that the country itself grew to be called by that name . - Matthew 14:35 In that that Christ healeth the sick , we are given to understand that we must seek remedy for spiritual diseases at his hands : and that we are bound not only to run ourselves , but also to bring others to him . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Matthew	14	2	And said unto his servants , This is that John Baptist , he is risen again from the dead , and therefore great [ b ] works are wrought by him .
GNV	Matthew	14	4	For John said unto him , It is not ( C ) lawful for thee to have her .
GNV	Matthew	14	5	And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a ( D ) Prophet .
GNV	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased [ c ] Herod .
GNV	Matthew	14	7	Wherefore he promised with an oath , that he would give her whatsoever she would ask .
GNV	Matthew	14	8	And she being before instructed of her mother , said , Give me here John Baptist ’ s head in a platter .
GNV	Matthew	14	9	And the king was sorry : nevertheless , because of the oath , and them that sat with him at the table , he commanded it to be given her ,
GNV	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought in a platter , and given to the maid , and she brought it unto her mother .
GNV	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
GNV	Matthew	14	15	¶ And when even was come , ( F ) his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is already past : let the multitude depart , that they may go into the towns , and buy them vittles .
GNV	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , They have no need to go away : give ye them to eat .
GNV	Matthew	14	17	Then said they unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
GNV	Matthew	14	19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
GNV	Matthew	14	20	And they did all eat , and were sufficed , and they took up of the fragments that remained , twelve baskets full .
GNV	Matthew	14	21	And they that had eaten , were about five thousand men , beside women and little children .
GNV	Matthew	14	22	¶ And straightway Jesus compelled his disciples to enter into a ship , and to go over before him , while he sent the multitude away .
GNV	Matthew	14	25	And in the [ f ] fourth watch of the night , Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
GNV	Matthew	14	26	And when his disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a [ g ] spirit , and cried out for fear .
GNV	Matthew	14	27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good comfort , It is I : be not afraid .
GNV	Matthew	14	29	And he said , Come . And when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water to go to Jesus .
GNV	Matthew	14	31	So immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said to him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt .
GNV	Matthew	14	32	And as soon as they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
GNV	Matthew	14	33	Then they that were in the ship , came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
GNV	Matthew	14	34	¶ ( H ) And when they were come over , they came into the land of [ i ] Gennesaret .
GNV	Matthew	14	35	[ j ] And when the men of that place knew him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were sick ,

GNV	Matthew	15	3	[ c ] But he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
GNV	Matthew	15	12	¶ Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Perceivest thou not , that the Pharisees are offended in hearing this saying ?
GNV	Matthew	15	13	But he answered and said , ( F ) Every plant which mine heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
GNV	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone , they be the ( G ) blind leaders of the blind : and if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
GNV	Matthew	15	18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth , come from the heart , and they defile the man .
GNV	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a woman a [ j ] Canaanite came out of the same coasts , and cried , saying unto him , Have mercy on me , O Lord , the son of David : my daughter is miserably vexed with a devil .
GNV	Matthew	15	26	And he answered , and said , It is not good to take the children ’ s bread , and to cast it to whelps .
GNV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered , and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it to thee , as thou desirest . And her daughter was made whole at that hour .
GNV	Matthew	15	32	( N ) [ o ] Then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on this multitude , because they have [ p ] continued with me already three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not let them depart fasting , lest they faint in the way .
GNV	Matthew	15	36	And took the seven loaves , and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
GNV	Matthew	15	1	Then [ a ] came to Jesus the Scribes and Pharisees , which were of Jerusalem , saying ,
GNV	Matthew	15	2	( A ) Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders ? for they [ b ] wash not their hands when they eat bread .
GNV	Matthew	15	4	( B ) For God hath commanded , saying , [ d ] Honor thy father and mother : ( C ) and he that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
GNV	Matthew	15	5	But ye say , [ e ] Whosoever shall say to father or mother , By the gift that is offered by me , thou mayest have profit ,
GNV	Matthew	15	6	Though he honor not his father , or his mother , shall be free : thus have ye made the commandment of God of no [ f ] authority by your tradition .
GNV	Matthew	15	7	[ g ] O hypocrites , Isaiah prophesied well of you , saying ,
GNV	Matthew	15	8	( D ) This people draweth near unto me with their mouth , and honoreth me with the lips , but their heart is far off from me .
GNV	Matthew	15	9	But in vain they worship me , teaching for doctrines , men ’ s precepts .
GNV	Matthew	15	10	[ h ] Then he called the multitude unto him , and said to them , Hear and understand .
GNV	Matthew	15	11	( E ) That which goeth into the mouth , defileth not the man , but that which cometh out of the mouth that defileth the man .
GNV	Matthew	15	16	Then said Jesus , Are ye yet without understanding ?
GNV	Matthew	15	17	Perceive ye not yet , that whatsoever entereth into the mouth , goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
GNV	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart ( I ) come evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false testimonies , slanders .
GNV	Matthew	15	20	These are the things which defile the man : but to eat with unwashed hands , defileth not the man .
GNV	Matthew	15	21	( J ) And Jesus went thence , and departed into the [ i ] coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
GNV	Matthew	15	23	[ k ] But he answered her not a word . Then came to him his disciples , and besought him , saying , Send her away , for she crieth after us .
GNV	Matthew	15	24	But he answered , and said , I am not sent , but unto the ( K ) lost sheep of the [ l ] house of Israel .
GNV	Matthew	15	25	Yet she came , and worshipped him , saying , Lord help me .
GNV	Matthew	15	27	But she said , Truth , Lord : yet indeed the whelps eat of the crumbs , which fall from their master ’ s table .
GNV	Matthew	15	29	¶ [ m ] So Jesus ( L ) went away from thence , and came near unto the sea of Galilee , and went up in a mountain and sat down there .
GNV	Matthew	15	30	And great multitudes came unto him , ( M ) having with them , halt , blind , dumb , [ n ] maimed , and many others , and cast them down , at Jesus ’ feet , and he healed them .
GNV	Matthew	15	31	Insomuch that the multitude wondered , to see the dumb speak , the maimed whole , the halt to go , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
GNV	Matthew	15	33	And his disciples said unto him , Whence should we get so much bread in the wilderness , as should suffice so great a multitude !
GNV	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus said unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes .
GNV	Matthew	15	35	Then he commandeth the multitude [ q ] to sit down on the ground .
GNV	Matthew	15	37	And they did all eat , and were sufficed , and they took up of the fragments that remained , seven [ r ] baskets full .
GNV	Matthew	15	38	And they that had eaten , were four thousand men , beside women , and little children .

GNV	Matthew	16	1	Then ( A ) [ a ] came the Pharisees and Sadducees , and did [ b ] tempt him , desiring him to show them a sign from heaven .
GNV	Matthew	16	6	Then Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
GNV	Matthew	16	12	Then understood they that he had not said that they should beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees , and Sadducees .
GNV	Matthew	16	13	¶ ( H ) [ j ] Now when Jesus came into the coasts of [ k ] Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I , the son of man , am ?
GNV	Matthew	16	17	[ m ] And Jesus answered , and said to him , Blessed art thou , Simon , the son of Jonah : for [ n ] flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven .
GNV	Matthew	16	18	[ o ] And I say also unto thee , that thou art ( J ) [ p ] Peter , and upon this rock I will build my Church : and the [ q ] gates of hell shall not overcome it .
GNV	Matthew	16	19	[ r ] And I ( K ) will give unto thee the [ s ] keys of the Kingdom of heaven , and whatsoever thou shalt [ t ] bind upon earth , shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth , shall be loosed in heaven .
GNV	Matthew	16	21	¶ [ v ] From that time forth Jesus began to show unto his disciples , that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the [ w ] Elders , and of the high Priests , and Scribes , and be slain and be raised again the third day .
GNV	Matthew	16	24	[ ab ] Jesus then said to his disciples , ( L ) If any man will follow me , let him forsake himself : and take up his cross , and follow me .
GNV	Matthew	16	25	For ( M ) whosoever will save his life , shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , shall [ ac ] find it .
GNV	Matthew	16	2	Cor . 10:4 , call them strongholds . - Matthew 16:19 The authority of the Church is from God . - Matthew 16:19 A metaphor taken of stewards which carry the keys : and here is set forth the power of the ministers of the word , as Isa . 22:22 , and that power is common to all ministers , as Matt . 18:18 , and therefore the ministers of the Gospel may rightly be called the key of the kingdom of heaven . - Matthew 16:19 They are bound whose sins are retained , heaven is shut against them , because they received not Christ by faith : on the other side , how happy are they , to whom heaven is open , which embrace Christ , and are delivered by him , and become fellow heirs with him . - Matthew 16:20 Men must first learn and then teach . - Matthew 16:21 The minds of men are in time to be prepared and made ready against the stumbling block of persecution . - Matthew 16:21 It was a name of dignity and not of age , and it is put for them , which were the Judges , which the Hebrews called Sanhedrin . - Matthew 16:22 Took him by the hand and led him aside , as they used to do , which meant to talk familiarly with one . - Matthew 16:23 Against a preposterous zeal . - Matthew 16:23 The Hebrews call him Satan , that is to say , an adversary , whom the Grecians call diabolos , that is to say , slanderer , or tempter : but it is spoken of them , that either of malice , as Judas , John 6:70 , or of lightness and pride resist the will of God . - Matthew 16:23 By this word we are taught that Peter sinned , through a false persuasion of himself . - Matthew 16:24 No men provide worse for themselves , than they that love themselves more than God . - Matthew 16:25 Shall gain himself : And this is his meaning , they that deny Christ to save themselves , do not only not gain that which they look for , but also lose the thing they would have kept , that is themselves , which loss is the greatest of all : but as for them that doubt not to die for Christ , it fareth far otherwise with them . - Matthew 16:27 Like a King , as Matt . 6:29 . - Matthew 16:28 By his kingdom is understood the glory of his ascension , and what followeth thereof , Eph . 4:10 , or the preaching of the Gospel , Mark 9:1 . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Matthew	16	3	( B ) And in the morning , ye say , Today shall be a tempest : for the sky is red and lowering . O hypocrites , ye can discern the [ c ] face of the sky , and can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
GNV	Matthew	16	4	( C ) The wicked generation , and adulterous seeketh a sign , but there shall no sign be given it , but [ d ] that sign of the Prophet ( D ) Jonah : so he left them , and departed .
GNV	Matthew	16	5	¶ [ e ] And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had ( E ) forgotten to take bread with them .
GNV	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have brought no bread .
GNV	Matthew	16	8	But Jesus [ f ] knowing it , said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye thus among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
GNV	Matthew	16	9	Do ye not yet perceive , neither remember the [ g ] five loaves , when there were ( F ) five thousand men , and how many baskets took ye up ?
GNV	Matthew	16	10	Neither the seven loaves when there were ( G ) four thousand men , and how many baskets took ye up ?
GNV	Matthew	16	11	Why [ h ] perceive ye not that I [ i ] said not unto you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ?
GNV	Matthew	16	14	And they said , Some say , [ l ] John Baptist : and some , Elijah : and others , Jeremiah , or one of the Prophets .
GNV	Matthew	16	15	. - Matthew 16:14 As Herod thought . - Matthew 16:17 Faith is of grace , not of nature . - Matthew 16:17 By this kind of speech is meant man ’ s natural procreation upon the earth , the creature not being destroyed which was made , but deformed through sin : So then this is the meaning : this was not revealed to thee by any understanding of man , but God showed it thee from heaven . - Matthew 16:18 That is true faith , which confesseth Christ , the virtue whereof is invisible . - Matthew 16:18 Christ spoke in the Syrian tongue , and therefore used not this descanting betwixt Petros , which signifieth Peter , and Petra , which signifieth a rock , but in both places used this word Cephas : but his mind was that wrote in Greek , by the divers termination to make a difference between Peter , who is a piece of the building , and Christ the Petra , that is , the rock and foundation : or else he gave his name Peter , because of the confession of his faith , which is the Church ’ s as well as his , as the old fathers witness : For so saith Theophylact , That confession which thou hast made , shall be the foundation of the believers . - Matthew 16:18 The enemies of the Church are compared to a strong kingdom , and therefore by Gates , are meant cities which are made strong with counsels and fortresses , and this is the meaning , whatsoever Satan can do by counsel or strength . So doth Paul ,
GNV	Matthew	16	20	[ u ] Then he charged his disciples , that they should tell no man that he was Jesus that Christ .
GNV	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter [ x ] took him aside , and began to rebuke him , saying , Master , pity thyself : this shall not be unto thee .
GNV	Matthew	16	23	[ y ] Then he turned back , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , [ z ] Satan : thou art an offence unto me , because thou [ aa ] understandest not the things that are of God , but the things that are of men .
GNV	Matthew	16	26	( N ) For what shall it profit a man though he should win the whole world , if he lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give for recompense of his soul ?
GNV	Matthew	16	27	For the son of man shall come [ ad ] in the glory of his Father with his Angels , and ( O ) then shall he give to every man according to his deeds .
GNV	Matthew	16	28	( P ) Verily I say unto you , there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the Son of man come in his [ ae ] kingdom . Footnotes - Matthew 16:1 The wicked which otherwise are at defiance one with another , agree well together against Christ , but do what they can , Christ beareth always the victory , and triumpheth over them . - Matthew 16:1 To try whether he could do that which they desired , but their purpose was naught , for they thought to find some thing in him by that means whereupon they might have just occasion to reprehend him : or else distrust and curiosity moved them so to do , for by such means also is God said to be tempted , that is to say , provoked to anger , as though men would strive with him . - Matthew 16:3 The outward show and countenance as it were of all things , is called in the Hebrews ’ tongue , a face . - Matthew 16:4 The article showeth the notableness of the deed . - Matthew 16:5 False teachers must be taken heed of . - Matthew 16:8 Not by others , but by virtue of his divinity . - Matthew 16:9 That five thousand men were filled with so many loaves ? - Matthew 16:11 A demand or question joined with admiration . - Matthew 16:11 Said , for commanded . - Matthew 16:13 There are divers judgments and opinions of Christ , notwithstanding he is known of his alone . - Matthew 16:13 There were two Caesareas , the one called Stratonis upon the sea Mediterranean , which Herod built sumptuously in the honor of Octavius , Josephus , lib .
GNV	Matthew	17	17	Then Jesus answered , and said , O generation faithless , and crooked , how long now shall I be with you ! how long now shall I suffer you ! bring him hither to me .

GNV	Matthew	17	2	And was [ c ] transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the Sun , and his clothes were as white as the light .
GNV	Matthew	17	5	While he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud shadowed them : and behold , there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , ( B ) This is [ d ] that my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased : hear him .
GNV	Matthew	17	12	But I say unto you , that Elijah is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they would : likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
GNV	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples perceived that he spake unto them of John Baptist .
GNV	Matthew	17	20	And Jesus said unto them , Because of your unbelief : for ( F ) verily I say unto you , if ye have faith as much as is a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place , and it shall remove : and nothing shall be impossible unto you .
GNV	Matthew	17	21	[ k ] Howbeit this kind goeth not out , but by [ l ] prayer and fasting .
GNV	Matthew	17	22	¶ [ m ] And they ( G ) being in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
GNV	Matthew	17	24	¶ [ n ] And when they were come to Capernaum , they that received poll money , came to Peter , and said , Doth [ o ] not your Master [ p ] pay [ q ] poll money ?
GNV	Matthew	17	1	And ( A ) [ a ] [ b ] after six days , Jesus took Peter and James , and John his brother , and brought them up into an high mountain apart ,
GNV	Matthew	17	3	And behold , there appeared unto them Moses , and Elijah , talking with him .
GNV	Matthew	17	4	didrachmas ; every drachma is about five pence . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Matthew	17	6	And when the disciples heard that , they [ e ] fell on their faces , and were sore afraid .
GNV	Matthew	17	7	Then Jesus came and touched them , and said , Arise , and be not afraid .
GNV	Matthew	17	8	And when they lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
GNV	Matthew	17	9	¶ And as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Show the [ f ] vision to no man , until the Son of man rise again from the dead .
GNV	Matthew	17	10	( C ) And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the Scribes that ( D ) Elijah must first come ?
GNV	Matthew	17	11	And Jesus answered , and said unto them , Certainly Elijah must first come , and restore all things .
GNV	Matthew	17	14	¶ ( E ) [ g ] And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , and [ h ] fell down at his feet ,
GNV	Matthew	17	15	And said , Master , have pity on my son : for he is [ i ] lunatic , and is sore vexed : for oft times he falleth into the fire , and oft times into the water .
GNV	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not heal him .
GNV	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked the devil , and he went out of him : and the child was healed at that hour .
GNV	Matthew	17	19	[ j ] Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ?
GNV	Matthew	17	23	And they shall kill him , but the third day shall he rise again : and they were very sorry .
GNV	Matthew	17	25	He said , Yes . And when he was come into the house , Jesus prevented him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? Of whom do the kings of the earth take tribute , or poll money ? of their [ r ] children , or of strangers ?
GNV	Matthew	17	26	Peter said unto him , Of strangers . Then said Jesus unto him , Then are the children free .
GNV	Matthew	17	27	Nevertheless , lest we should offend them : go to the sea , and cast in an angle , and take the first fish that cometh up , and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a [ s ] piece of twenty pence : that take , and give it unto them for me and thee .

For he is God ’ s natural Son , we by adoption , therefore he is called the first begotten among the brethren , because that although he be of right the only Son , yet is he chief among many in that he is the fountain and head of the adoption . - Matthew 17:6 Fell down flat on their faces and worshipped him , as Matt . 2:11 . - Matthew 17:9 Which they saw : otherwise the word , used in this place is properly spoken of that which is seen in a dream . - Matthew 17:14 Men are unworthy of Christ his goodness , yet notwithstanding he regardeth them . - Matthew 17:14 As men that make supplications used to do . - Matthew 17:15 They that at certain times of the moon are troubled with the falling sickness , or any other kind of disease : but in this place , we must so take it , that besides the natural disease , he had a devilish frenzy . - Matthew 17:19 Incredulity and distrust hinder and break the course of God ’ s benefits . - Matthew 17:21 The remedy against distrust . - Matthew 17:21 To give us to understand the watchfulness and diligence of earnest prayer , which can not be without sobriety . - Matthew 17:22 Our minds must be prepared more and more against the offence of the cross . - Matthew 17:24 In that that Christ doth willingly obey Caesar ’ s edicts , he showeth that civil policy is not taken away by the Gospel . - Matthew 17:24 He denieth not , but he asketh . - Matthew 17:24 Ought he not to pay ? - Matthew 17:24 They that were from twenty years of age to fifty , paid half a shekel of the Sanctuary , Exod . 30:13 .

GNV	Matthew	18	1	The ( A ) same time the disciples came unto Jesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
GNV	Matthew	18	5	And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my Name , receiveth me .
GNV	Matthew	18	6	( C ) [ d ] But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him , that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
GNV	Matthew	18	7	[ e ] Woe be unto the world because of offences , for it must needs be that [ f ] offences shall come , but woe be to that man by whom the offence cometh .
GNV	Matthew	18	9	And if thine eye cause thee to offend , pluck it out and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
GNV	Matthew	18	10	[ h ] See that ye despise not one of these little ones : for I say unto you , that in heaven their ( E ) Angels always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
GNV	Matthew	18	11	For ( F ) the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
GNV	Matthew	18	15	¶ ( H ) [ i ] Moreover , if thy brother trespass against [ j ] thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he hear thee , thou hast won thy brother .
GNV	Matthew	18	17	[ m ] And if he [ n ] refuse to hear them , tell it unto the [ o ] Church : and if he refuse to hear the Church also , let him be unto thee as an [ p ] heathen man , and a Publican .
GNV	Matthew	18	21	[ r ] Then came Peter to him , and said , Master , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I shall forgive him ? ( L ) unto seven times ?
GNV	Matthew	18	23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain King , which would take an account of his servants .
GNV	Matthew	18	2	[ a ] And Jesus called a [ b ] little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
GNV	Matthew	18	3	And said , Verily I say unto you , except ye be ( B ) [ c ] converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
GNV	Matthew	18	4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
GNV	Matthew	18	8	( D ) Wherefore , if thy hand or thy foot cause thee to [ g ] offend , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life , halt , or maimed , than having two hands , or two feet , to be cast into everlasting fire .
GNV	Matthew	18	12	How think ye ? ( G ) If a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave ninety and nine , and go into the mountains , and seek that which is gone astray ?
GNV	Matthew	18	13	And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray :
GNV	Matthew	18	14	So is it not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
GNV	Matthew	18	16	But if he hear thee not , take yet with thee one or two , that by the ( I ) [ k ] mouth of two or three witnesses , every word may be [ l ] confirmed .
GNV	Matthew	18	19	Again , verily I say unto you , that if two of you shall [ q ] agree in earth upon anything , whatsoever they shall desire , it shall be given them of my Father which is in heaven .
GNV	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together in my Name , there am I in the midst of them .
GNV	Matthew	18	22	Jesus said unto him , I say not to thee , Unto seven times , but , Unto seventy times seven times .
GNV	Matthew	18	24	And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which ought him [ s ] ten thousand talents .
GNV	Matthew	18	25	And because he had nothing to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and his children , and all that he had , and the debt to be paid .
GNV	Matthew	18	26	The servant therefore fell down , and [ t ] worshipped him , saying , Lord , [ u ] refrain thine anger toward me , and I will pay thee all .
GNV	Matthew	18	27	Then that servant ’ s lord had compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
GNV	Matthew	18	28	But when the servant was departed , he found one of his fellow servants which ought him an hundred pence , and he laid hands on him , and throttled him , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
GNV	Matthew	18	29	Then his fellow servant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Refrain thine anger toward me , and I will pay thee all .
GNV	Matthew	18	30	Yet he would not , but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
GNV	Matthew	18	31	And when his other fellow servants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came , and declared unto their lord all that was done .
GNV	Matthew	18	32	Then his lord called him unto him , and said to him , O evil servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou prayedst me .
GNV	Matthew	18	33	Oughtest not thou also to have had pity on thy fellow servant , even as I had pity on thee ?
GNV	Matthew	18	34	So his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due to him .
GNV	Matthew	18	35	So likewise shall mine heavenly Father do unto you , except ye forgive from your hearts , each one to his brother their trespasses .

GNV	Matthew	19	2	And great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there .
GNV	Matthew	19	3	¶ [ b ] Then came unto him the Pharisees tempting him , and saying to him , Is it lawful for a man to [ c ] put away his wife upon every occasion ?
GNV	Matthew	19	7	[ g ] They said to him , Why did then ( D ) Moses command to give a bill of divorcement , and to put her away ?
GNV	Matthew	19	12	For there are some [ n ] eunuchs , which were so born of their mother ’ s belly : and there be some eunuchs , which be gelded by men : and there be some eunuchs , which have [ o ] gelded themselves for the kingdom of heaven . He that is able to receive this , let him receive it .
GNV	Matthew	19	13	¶ ( F ) [ p ] Then were brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
GNV	Matthew	19	17	And he said unto him , Why called thou me good ? there is none good but one , even God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the Commandments .
GNV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said unto him , If [ r ] thou wilt be perfect , go , sell that thou hast , and give it to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , and follow me .
GNV	Matthew	19	23	[ s ] Then Jesus said unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
GNV	Matthew	19	26	And Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible .
GNV	Matthew	19	27	¶ ( I ) Then answered Peter , and said to him , Behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee : what therefore shall we have ?
GNV	Matthew	19	1	And ( A ) it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he [ a ] departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan .
GNV	Matthew	19	4	And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , ( B ) that he which made them at the beginning , made them male and female ,
GNV	Matthew	19	5	And said , ( C ) For this cause , shall a man leave father and mother , and [ d ] cleave unto his wife , and they which were [ e ] two , shall be one flesh ?
GNV	Matthew	19	6	Wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . Let not man therefore put asunder that , which God hath [ f ] coupled together .
GNV	Matthew	19	8	He said unto them , Moses , [ h ] because of the hardness of your heart , [ i ] suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
GNV	Matthew	19	9	I say therefore unto you , ( E ) that whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be [ j ] for whoredom , and marry another , commiteth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her which is divorced , doth commit adultery .
GNV	Matthew	19	10	Then said his disciples to him , If the [ k ] matter be so between man and wife , it is not good to marry .
GNV	Matthew	19	11	[ l ] But he said unto them , All men can not [ m ] receive this thing , save they to whom it is given .
GNV	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not to come to me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
GNV	Matthew	19	15	And when he had put his hands on them , he departed thence .
GNV	Matthew	19	16	¶ ( G ) [ q ] And behold , one came and said unto him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
GNV	Matthew	19	18	He said unto him , Which ? And Jesus said , ( H ) These , Thou shalt not kill : Thou shalt not commit adultery : Thou shalt not steal : Thou shalt not bear false witness .
GNV	Matthew	19	20	The young man said unto him , I have observed all these things from my youth . What lack I yet ?
GNV	Matthew	19	22	And when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
GNV	Matthew	19	24	And again I say unto you , It is [ t ] easier for a [ u ] camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .

GNV	Matthew	20	3	And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
GNV	Matthew	20	4	And said unto them , Go ye also into my vineyard , and whatsoever is right , I will give you : and they went their way .
GNV	Matthew	20	5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
GNV	Matthew	20	6	And he went about the [ c ] eleventh hour , and found others standing idle , and said unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
GNV	Matthew	20	7	They said unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He said to them , Go ye also into my vineyard , and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
GNV	Matthew	20	8	¶ And when even was come , the master of the vineyard said unto his steward , Call the laborers , and give them their hire , beginning at the last , till thou come to the first .
GNV	Matthew	20	9	And they which were hired about the eleventh hour , came and received every man a penny .

GNV	Matthew	20	13	And he answered one of them , saying , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst thou not agree with me for a penny ?
GNV	Matthew	20	14	Take that which is thine own , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , as much as to thee .

GNV	Matthew	21	13	And said to them , It is written , ( E ) My house shall be called the house of prayer : but ( F ) ye have made it a den of thieves .
GNV	Matthew	21	19	And seeing a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said to it , Never fruit grow on thee henceforward . And anon the fig tree withered .
GNV	Matthew	21	25	The [ r ] baptism of John , whence was it ? from [ s ] heaven , or of men ? Then they [ t ] reasoned among themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven , he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
GNV	Matthew	21	28	¶ [ u ] But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons , and came to the elder , and said , Son , go and work today in my vineyard .
GNV	Matthew	21	30	Then came he to the second , and said likewise . And he answered , and said , I will , Sir : yet he went not .
GNV	Matthew	21	33	¶ [ x ] Hear another parable , There was a certain householder , ( M ) which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and made a winepress therein , and [ y ] built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a strange country .
GNV	Matthew	21	38	But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , ( N ) This is the heir : come , let us kill him , and let us [ z ] take his inheritance .
GNV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said unto them , Read ye never in the Scriptures , ( O ) The stone which the [ ab ] builders refused , the same is [ ac ] made the [ ad ] head of the corner ? [ ae ] This was the Lord ’ s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes .

GNV	Matthew	21	8	And a great multitude spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
GNV	Matthew	21	9	Moreover , the people that went before , and they also that followed , cried , saying , [ f ] Hosanna to the Son of David , [ g ] Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord , Hosanna thou which art in the highest heavens .
GNV	Matthew	21	10	( C ) And when he was come into Jerusalem , [ h ] all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
GNV	Matthew	21	11	And the people said , This is Jesus that Prophet of Nazareth in Galilee .
GNV	Matthew	21	14	Then the blind , and the halt came to him , in the Temple , and he healed them .
GNV	Matthew	21	15	[ i ] But when the chief Priests and Scribes saw the marvels that he did , and the children crying in the Temple , and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David , they disdained ,
GNV	Matthew	21	16	And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus said unto them , Yea : read ye never , ( G ) By the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast [ j ] made perfect the praise ?
GNV	Matthew	21	17	¶ [ k ] So he left them , and went out of the city unto Bethany , and lodged there .
GNV	Matthew	21	18	[ l ] And ( H ) in the morning , as he returned into the city , he was hungry .
GNV	Matthew	21	20	And when his disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered !

GNV	Matthew	21	23	¶ ( K ) [ o ] And when he was come into the Temple , the chief Priests , and the Elders of the people came unto him , as he was teaching , and said , By what [ p ] authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
GNV	Matthew	21	24	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , I also will ask of you [ q ] a certain thing , which if ye tell me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
GNV	Matthew	21	26	And if we say , Of men , we fear the multitude , ( L ) for all hold John as a Prophet .
GNV	Matthew	21	27	Then they answered Jesus , and said , We can not tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
GNV	Matthew	21	29	But he answered , and said , I will not : yet afterward he repented himself , and went .
GNV	Matthew	21	31	Whether of them twain did the will of the father ? They said unto him , The first . Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , that the Publicans and the harlots [ v ] go before you into the kingdom of God .
GNV	Matthew	21	32	For John came unto you in the [ w ] way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the Publicans and the harlots believed him , and ye though ye saw it , were not moved with repentance afterward , that ye might believe him .
GNV	Matthew	21	34	And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive the fruits thereof .
GNV	Matthew	21	35	And the husbandmen took his servants and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
GNV	Matthew	21	36	Again he sent other servants , more than the first : and they did the like unto them .
GNV	Matthew	21	37	But last of all he sent unto them his own son , saying , They will reverence my son .
GNV	Matthew	21	39	So they took him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
GNV	Matthew	21	40	When therefore the Lord of the vineyard shall come , what will he do to those husbandmen ?
GNV	Matthew	21	41	They said unto him , He will [ aa ] cruelly destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall deliver him the fruits in their seasons .
GNV	Matthew	21	43	Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and shall be given to a nation , which shall bring forth the [ af ] fruits thereof .
GNV	Matthew	21	44	( P ) And whosoever shall fall on this stone , he shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will [ ag ] dash him in pieces .

GNV	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which married his son ,
GNV	Matthew	22	9	[ e ] Go ye therefore out into the highways , and as many as ye find , bid them to the marriage .
GNV	Matthew	22	11	[ g ] Then the king came in , to see the guests , and saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment .
GNV	Matthew	22	16	And they sent unto him their disciples with the [ k ] Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God [ l ] truly , neither carest for any man : for thou considerest not the [ m ] person of men .
GNV	Matthew	22	23	¶ ( F ) [ q ] The same day the Sadducees came to him , ( which say that there is no resurrection ) and asked him ,
GNV	Matthew	22	32	( H ) I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
GNV	Matthew	22	36	Master , which is the great commandment in the Law ?
GNV	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said to him , ( J ) Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart , with all thy [ v ] soul , and with all thy mind .
GNV	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like unto this , ( K ) Thou shalt love thy [ w ] neighbor as thyself .
GNV	Matthew	22	42	Saying , What think ye of Christ ? [ y ] whose son is he ? They said unto him , David ’ s .
GNV	Matthew	22	1	Then ( A ) [ a ] Jesus answered , and spake unto them again in parables , saying ,
GNV	Matthew	22	3	And sent forth his servants , to call them that were bidden to the wedding , but they would not come .
GNV	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : mine oxen and my fatlings are [ b ] killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
GNV	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , and another about his merchandise .
GNV	Matthew	22	6	And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them sharply , and slew them .
GNV	Matthew	22	7	[ c ] But when the king heard it , he was wroth , and sent forth his warriors , and destroyed those murderers , and burnt up their city .
GNV	Matthew	22	8	Then said he to his servants , Truly the [ d ] wedding is prepared : but they which were bidden , were not worthy .
GNV	Matthew	22	10	So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all that ever they found , both good and [ f ] bad : so the wedding was furnished with guests .
GNV	Matthew	22	12	And he said unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither , and hast not on a wedding garment ? And he was [ h ] speechless .
GNV	Matthew	22	13	Then said the king to the [ i ] servants , Bind him hand and foot : take him away , and cast him into utter darkness : ( B ) there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
GNV	Matthew	22	14	( C ) For many are called , but few chosen .
GNV	Matthew	22	15	¶ ( D ) Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might [ j ] tangle him in talk .
GNV	Matthew	22	17	[ n ] Tell us therefore , how thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give [ o ] tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
GNV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
GNV	Matthew	22	19	Show me the tribute money . And they brought him a [ p ] penny .
GNV	Matthew	22	20	And he said unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
GNV	Matthew	22	21	They said unto him , Caesar ’ s . Then said he unto them , ( E ) Give therefore to Caesar , the things which are Caesar ’ s , and give unto God , those things which are God ’ s .
GNV	Matthew	22	24	Saying , Master , ( G ) Moses said , If a man die , having no [ r ] children , his brother shall marry his wife by the right of alliance , and raise up seed unto his brother .
GNV	Matthew	22	25	Now therefore were with us seven brethren , and the first married a wife , and deceased : and having no issue , left his wife unto his brother .
GNV	Matthew	22	26	Likewise also the second , and the third , unto the seventh .
GNV	Matthew	22	27	And last of all the woman died also .
GNV	Matthew	22	28	Therefore in the resurrection , whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for all had her .
GNV	Matthew	22	29	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , Ye are deceived , not knowing the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
GNV	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry wives , nor wives are bestowed in marriage , but are as the [ s ] Angels of God in heaven .
GNV	Matthew	22	31	And concerning the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read what is spoken unto you of God , saying ,
GNV	Matthew	22	33	And when the multitude heard it , they were astonied at his doctrine .
GNV	Matthew	22	34	¶ ( I ) [ t ] But when the Pharisees had heard , that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they assembled together .
GNV	Matthew	22	35	And [ u ] one of them , which was an expounder of the Law , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
GNV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and the great commandment .
GNV	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments hangeth the whole Law and the Prophets .
GNV	Matthew	22	41	¶ ( L ) [ x ] While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
GNV	Matthew	22	43	He said unto them , How then doth David in spirit , call him Lord , saying ,
GNV	Matthew	22	44	( M ) The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?

GNV	Matthew	25	26	And his master answered , and said unto him , Thou evil servant , and slothful , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I strawed not .
GNV	Matthew	25	27	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the [ g ] exchangers , and then at my coming should I have received mine own with vantage .

GNV	Matthew	26	6	¶ ( C ) [ d ] And when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
GNV	Matthew	26	15	And said , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you , and they appointed unto him thirty pieces of silver .
GNV	Matthew	26	34	( N ) Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
GNV	Matthew	26	36	¶ ( O ) [ y ] Then went Jesus with them into a place which is called Gethsemane , and said unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I go , and pray yonder .
GNV	Matthew	26	47	( P ) And while he yet spake , lo , Judas one of the twelve came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , [ af ] from the high Priests and Elders of the people .
GNV	Matthew	26	57	¶ ( T ) [ am ] And they took Jesus , and led him to [ an ] Caiaphas the high Priest , where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled .
GNV	Matthew	26	64	( W ) Jesus said to him , Thou hast said it : nevertheless I say unto you , [ aq ] Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man , sitting [ ar ] at the right hand of the power of God , and come in the [ as ] clouds of the heaven .
GNV	Matthew	26	67	( X ) Then spat they in his face , and buffeted him , and others smote him with rods ,
GNV	Matthew	26	1	. - Matthew 26:8 This is a figure called Synecdoche : for it is said but of Judas that he was moved thereat , John 12:4 . - Matthew 26:8 Unprofitable spending . - Matthew 26:10 We ought not rashly to condemn that which is not orderly done . - Matthew 26:11 Christ , who was once anointed in his own person , must always be anointed in the poor . - Matthew 26:12 In that she poured this ointment upon my body , she did it to bury me . - Matthew 26:17 Christ verily purposing to bring us into our country out of hand , and so to abrogate the figure of the Law , fulfilleth the Law , neglecting the contrary tradition and custom of the Jews , and there withall showeth that all things shall so come to pass by the ministry of men , that the secret counsel of God shall govern them . - Matthew 26:17 This was the fourteenth day of the first month : and the first day of unleavened bread should have been the fifteenth , but because this day ’ s evening ( which after the manner of the Romans was referred to the day before ) did belong by the Jews ’ manner to the day following , therefore it is called the first day of unleavened bread . - Matthew 26:20 Because the Law appointed them to be shod , and have their staffs in their hands , as though they were in haste , thereby it is to be gathered that they sat not down when they did eat the Passover , but stood , for otherwise when they went to meat , they put off their shoes : therefore he speaketh here in this place , not of the Passover , but of the Supper , which was celebrated after that the Passover was solemnly done . - Matthew 26:23 That is to say , whom I vouchsafed to come to my table , alluding to the place , Ps . 41:9 , which is not so to be understood , as though at the selfsame instant that the Lord spake these words , Judas had had his hand in the dish ( for that had been an undoubted token ) but it is meant of his tabling and eating with them . - Matthew 26:25 Whose head was about nothing then but to betray him . - Matthew 26:26 Christ minding forthwith to fulfill the promises of the old covenant , instituteth a new covenant with new figures . - Matthew 26:26 Mark saith , Had given thanks : and therefore blessing is not a consecrating , with a conjuring kind of murmuring and force of words : and yet the bread and the wine are changed , not in nature , but in quality , for they become undoubted tokens of the body and blood of Christ , not of their own nature or force of words , but by Christ his institution , which must be recited and laid forth , that faith may find what to lay hold on , both in the word and in the elements . - Matthew 26:26 This is a figurative speech , which is called Metonymy : that is to say , the putting of one name for another—so calling the bread his body , which is the sign and sacrament of his body : and yet notwithstanding , it is so a figurative and changed kind of speech , that the faithful do receive Christ indeed with all his gifts ( though by a spiritual means ) and become one with him . - Matthew 26:27 Therefore they which took away the cup from the people , did against Christ his institution . - Matthew 26:28 To wit , this cup or wine , is my blood Sacramentally , as Luke 22:20 . - Matthew 26:28 Or covenant , that is to say , whereby the new league and covenant is made , for in making of leagues , they used pouring of wine , and shedding of blood . - Matthew 26:30 When they had made an end of their solemn singing , which some think was six Psalms , beginning at Ps .
GNV	Matthew	26	2	[ b ] Ye know that after two days is the Passover , and the Son of man shall be delivered to be crucified .
GNV	Matthew	26	4	And consulted together that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
GNV	Matthew	26	5	But they said , Not on the [ c ] feast day , lest any uproar be among the people .
GNV	Matthew	26	7	[ e ] There came unto him a woman , which had a [ f ] box of very costly ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at the table .
GNV	Matthew	26	8	And when his [ g ] disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , What needed this [ h ] waste ?
GNV	Matthew	26	9	For this ointment might have been sold for much , and been given to the poor .
GNV	Matthew	26	10	[ i ] And Jesus knowing it , said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
GNV	Matthew	26	11	( D ) [ j ] For ye have the poor always with you , but me shall ye not have always .
GNV	Matthew	26	12	For [ k ] in that she poured this ointment on my body , she did it to bury me .
GNV	Matthew	26	13	, chapter
GNV	Matthew	26	14	¶ ( E ) Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief Priests ,
GNV	Matthew	26	16	And from that time , he sought opportunity to betray him .
GNV	Matthew	26	17	¶ ( F ) [ l ] Now [ m ] on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover ?
GNV	Matthew	26	18	And he said , Go ye into the city to such a man , and say to him , The master saith , My time is at hand : I will keep the Passover at thine house with my disciples .
GNV	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus had given them charge , and made ready the Passover .
GNV	Matthew	26	20	( G ) So when the even was come , he [ n ] sat down with the twelve .
GNV	Matthew	26	21	And as they did eat , he said , ( H ) Verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
GNV	Matthew	26	22	And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , Is it I , Master ?
GNV	Matthew	26	23	And he answered and said , ( I ) He that [ o ] dippeth his hand with me in the dish , he shall betray me .
GNV	Matthew	26	24	Surely the Son of man goeth his way , as it is written of him : but woe be to that man , by whom the Son of man is betrayed : it had been good for that man , if he had never been born .
GNV	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas [ p ] which betrayed him , answered , and said , Is it I , master ? He said unto him , Thou hast said it .
GNV	Matthew	26	27	Also he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it them , saying , Drink ye [ t ] all of it .
GNV	Matthew	26	28	[ u ] For this is my blood of the [ v ] new Testament that is shed for many , for the remission of sins .
GNV	Matthew	26	29	I say unto you that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day , when I shall drink it new with you in my Father ’ s kingdom .
GNV	Matthew	26	30	And when they had sung [ w ] a Psalm , they went out into the mount of Olives .
GNV	Matthew	26	31	¶ [ x ] ( K ) Then said Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended by me this night : for it is written , I ( L ) will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered .
GNV	Matthew	26	32	But ( M ) after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
GNV	Matthew	26	33	But Peter answered , and said unto him , Though that all men should be offended by thee , yet will I never be offended .
GNV	Matthew	26	35	Peter said unto him , Though I should die with thee , I will in no case deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
GNV	Matthew	26	37	And he took unto him Peter , and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to wax sorrowful , and [ z ] grievously troubled .
GNV	Matthew	26	38	[ aa ] Then said Jesus unto them , My soul is very heavy , even unto the death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
GNV	Matthew	26	39	So he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , [ ab ] let this [ ac ] cup pass from me : nevertheless , not as I will , but as thou wilt .
GNV	Matthew	26	40	[ ad ] After , he came unto the disciples , and found them asleep , and said to Peter , What ? could ye not watch with me one hour ?
GNV	Matthew	26	41	Watch , and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is ready , but the flesh is weak .
GNV	Matthew	26	42	Again he went away the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup can not pass away from me , but that I must drink it , thy will be done .
GNV	Matthew	26	43	And he came and found them asleep again , for their eyes were heavy .
GNV	Matthew	26	44	So he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
GNV	Matthew	26	45	Then came he to his disciples , and said unto them , Sleep henceforth , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is given into the hands of sinners .
GNV	Matthew	26	46	[ ae ] Rise , let us go : behold , he is at hand that betrayeth me .
GNV	Matthew	26	48	Now he that betrayed him , had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he , lay hold on him .
GNV	Matthew	26	49	And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , God save thee , Master , and kissed him .
GNV	Matthew	26	50	[ ag ] Then Jesus said unto him , [ ah ] Friend , wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
GNV	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of them which were with Jesus , stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high Priest , and smote off his ear .
GNV	Matthew	26	52	[ ai ] Then said Jesus unto him , Put up thy sword into his place : ( Q ) for all that [ aj ] take the sword , shall perish with the sword .
GNV	Matthew	26	53	[ ak ] Either thinkest thou , that I can not now pray to my Father , and he will give me more than twelve legions of Angels ?
GNV	Matthew	26	54	[ al ] How then should the ( R ) Scriptures be fulfilled , which say , that it must be so ?
GNV	Matthew	26	55	The same hour said Jesus to the multitude , Ye be come out as it were against a thief , with swords and staves to take me : I sat daily teaching in the Temple among you , and ye took me not .
GNV	Matthew	26	56	But all this was done , that the Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled . ( S ) Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
GNV	Matthew	26	58	And Peter followed him afar off unto the high Priest ’ s [ ao ] hall , and went in and sat with the servants to see the end .
GNV	Matthew	26	59	Now ( U ) the chief Priests and the Elders , and all the whole Council sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death .
GNV	Matthew	26	60	But they found none , and though many false witnesses came , yet found they none : but at the last came two false witnesses ,
GNV	Matthew	26	61	And said , This man said , ( V ) I can destroy the Temple of God , and build it in three days .
GNV	Matthew	26	62	Then the chief Priest arose , and said to him , Answerest thou nothing ? [ ap ] What is the matter that these men witness against thee ?
GNV	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus held his peace . Then the chief Priest answered , and said to him , I charge thee swear unto us by the living God , to tell us , If thou be that Christ the son of God , or no .
GNV	Matthew	26	65	Then the high Priest [ at ] rent his clothes , saying , He hath blasphemed , what have we any more need of witnesses : behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
GNV	Matthew	26	66	What think ye ? They answered , and said , He is guilty of death .
GNV	Matthew	26	68	Saying , Prophesy to us , O Christ , Who is he that smote thee ?
GNV	Matthew	26	69	¶ ( Y ) [ au ] Peter [ av ] sat without in the hall , and a maid came to him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee :
GNV	Matthew	26	70	But he denied before them all , saying , I wot not what thou sayest .
GNV	Matthew	26	71	And when he went out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
GNV	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath , saying , I know not the man .
GNV	Matthew	26	73	So after a while , came unto him they that stood by , and said unto Peter , Surely thou art also one of them : for even thy speech bewrayeth thee .
GNV	Matthew	26	74	Then began he to [ aw ] curse himself , and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew .
GNV	Matthew	26	75	Then Peter remembered the words of Jesus , which had said unto him , Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice . So he went out , and wept bitterly .

GNV	Matthew	27	31	Thus when they had mocked him , they took the robe from him , and put his own raiment on him , and let him away to crucify him .

GNV	Matthew	27	41	Likewise also the high Priests mocking him , with the Scribes , and Elders , and Pharisees , said ,
GNV	Matthew	27	42	He saved others , but he can not save himself : if he be the king of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe in him .
GNV	Matthew	27	43	( L ) He trusted in God , let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .

GNV	Matthew	27	45	[ y ] Now from the sixth hour was there darkness over all the land , unto the ninth hour .
GNV	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with loud voice , saying , ( M ) Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is , My God , my God , why hast thou [ z ] forsaken me ?
GNV	Matthew	27	47	And some of them that stood there , when they heard it , said , This man calleth [ aa ] Elijah .
GNV	Matthew	27	48	And straightway one of them ran , and took ( N ) a sponge and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .

GNV	Matthew	27	56	Among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Joses , and the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons .
GNV	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate , and asked the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
GNV	Matthew	27	59	So Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
GNV	Matthew	27	60	And put it in his new tomb , which he had hewn out in a rock , and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher , and departed .
GNV	Matthew	27	61	And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulcher .
GNV	Matthew	27	63	And said , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , Within three days I will rise .
GNV	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore , that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day , lest his Disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so shall the last error be worse than the first .
GNV	Matthew	27	65	Then Pilate said unto them , Ye have a [ ah ] watch : go , and make it sure , as ye know .

GNV	Mark	1	4	( C ) [ e ] John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the [ f ] baptism of amendment of life , for remission of sins .
GNV	Mark	1	6	( D ) Now John was clothed with camel ’ s hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins : and he did eat ( E ) locusts and wild honey ,
GNV	Mark	1	9	¶ ( G ) [ j ] And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth , a city of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
GNV	Mark	1	12	( H ) [ n ] And immediately the Spirit [ o ] driveth him into the wilderness .
GNV	Mark	1	14	¶ ( I ) [ p ] Now after that John was committed to prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the Gospel of the kingdom of God ,
GNV	Mark	1	21	¶ So ( K ) they entered into [ s ] Capernaum : and straightway on the Sabbath day he entered into the Synagogue , and taught .
GNV	Mark	1	29	¶ ( M ) [ ab ] And as soon as they were come out of the Synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
GNV	Mark	1	23	¶ [ t ] And there was in their Synagogue a man [ u ] in whom was an unclean spirit , and he cried out ,
GNV	Mark	1	32	And when even was come , at what time the Sun setteth , they brought to him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
GNV	Mark	1	40	¶ ( N ) [ ae ] And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeled down unto him , and said to him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
GNV	Mark	1	2	[ a ] As it is written in the [ b ] Prophets , ( A ) Behold , [ c ] I send my messenger [ d ] before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
GNV	Mark	1	3	( B ) The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness , is , Prepare the way of the Lord : make his paths straight .
GNV	Mark	1	5	And all the country of Judea , and they of Jerusalem went out unto him , and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins .
GNV	Mark	1	7	( F ) [ g ] And preached , saying , A stronger than I cometh after me , whose shoe ’ s latchet I am not worthy to [ h ] stoop down , and unloose .
GNV	Mark	1	8	Truth it is , I have [ i ] baptized you with water : but he will baptize you with the holy Ghost .
GNV	Mark	1	10	[ k ] And as soon as [ l ] he was come out of the water , John saw the heavens cloven in twain , and the holy Ghost descending upon him like a dove .
GNV	Mark	1	11	Then there was a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am [ m ] well pleased .
GNV	Mark	1	13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days , and was tempted of Satan : he was also with the wild beasts , and the Angels ministered unto him .
GNV	Mark	1	15	And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent and believe the Gospel .
GNV	Mark	1	16	¶ ( J ) [ q ] And as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ( for they were fishers . )
GNV	Mark	1	17	Then Jesus said unto them , Follow me , and I will make you to be fishers of men .
GNV	Mark	1	18	And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
GNV	Mark	1	19	[ r ] And when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , as they were in the ship , mending their nets .
GNV	Mark	1	20	And anon he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired servants , and went their way after him .
GNV	Mark	1	22	And they were astonied at his doctrine , ( L ) for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the Scribes .
GNV	Mark	1	24	Saying , Ah , what have we to do with thee , O [ v ] Jesus of Nazareth ? Art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee what thou art , even thou [ w ] holy one of God .
GNV	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
GNV	Mark	1	26	And the unclean spirit [ x ] tare him , and cried with a loud voice , and came out of him .
GNV	Mark	1	27	And they were all amazed , so that they demanded [ y ] one of another , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for he [ z ] commandeth even the foul spirits with authority , and they obey him .
GNV	Mark	1	28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region [ aa ] bordering on Galilee .
GNV	Mark	1	30	And Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they told him of her .
GNV	Mark	1	31	And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up , and the fever forsook her by and by , and she ministered unto them .
GNV	Mark	1	33	And the whole city was gathered together at the door .
GNV	Mark	1	34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases : and he cast out many devils , and [ ac ] suffered not the devils to say that they knew him .
GNV	Mark	1	35	And in the morning very early before day , Jesus arose and went out into a solitary place , and there prayed .
GNV	Mark	1	36	And Simon , and they that were with him , followed carefully after him .
GNV	Mark	1	37	And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
GNV	Mark	1	38	Then he said unto them , Let us go into the [ ad ] next towns , that I may preach there also : for I came out for that purpose .
GNV	Mark	1	39	And he preached in their Synagogues , throughout all Galilee , and cast the devils out .
GNV	Mark	1	41	And Jesus had compassion , and put forth his hand , and touched him , and said to him , I will : be thou clean .
GNV	Mark	1	42	And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean .
GNV	Mark	1	43	And after he had given him a straight commandment , he sent him away forthwith ,
GNV	Mark	1	44	[ af ] And said unto him , See thou say nothing to any man , but get thee hence , and show thyself to the ( O ) [ ag ] Priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimonial unto them .
GNV	Mark	1	45	But when he was departed , ( P ) he began to tell many things , and to publish the matter : so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .

GNV	Mark	2	3	And there came unto him , that brought one sick of the palsy , borne of four men .
GNV	Mark	2	4	And because they could not come near unto him for the multitude , they uncovered the roof of the house where he was : and when they had broken it open , they [ d ] let down the [ e ] bed , wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
GNV	Mark	2	14	( C ) And as Jesus passed by , he saw [ i ] Levi the son of Alphaeus sit at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him .
GNV	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the marriage chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
GNV	Mark	2	23	¶ ( F ) [ k ] And it came to pass as he went through the corn on the [ l ] Sabbath day , that his disciples , as they went on their way , began to pluck the ears of corn .
GNV	Mark	2	26	How he went into the house of God , in the days of [ m ] Abiathar the high Priest , and did eat the Showbread , which were not lawful to eat , but for the ( H ) Priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
GNV	Mark	2	1	Kings 2:26 ;
GNV	Mark	2	5	Now when Jesus saw their faith , he said to the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins are forgiven thee .
GNV	Mark	2	6	And there were certain of the Scribes sitting there , and [ f ] reasoning in their hearts ,
GNV	Mark	2	7	Why doth this man speak such blasphemies ? ( B ) who can forgive sins , but God only ?
GNV	Mark	2	8	And immediately , when Jesus perceived in his spirit , that thus they reasoned with themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
GNV	Mark	2	9	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins are forgiven thee ? or to say , Arise , take up thy bed , and walk ?
GNV	Mark	2	10	But that ye may know , that the Son of man hath authority in earth to forgive sins , he said unto the sick of the palsy ,
GNV	Mark	2	11	I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy bed , and get thee hence into thine own house .
GNV	Mark	2	12	And by and by he arose , and took up his bed , and went forth before them all , insomuch that they were all [ g ] amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw such a thing .
GNV	Mark	2	13	¶ [ h ] Then he went forth again toward the sea , and all the people resorted unto him , and he taught them .
GNV	Mark	2	15	¶ And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at table in his house , many Publicans and sinners sat at table also with Jesus , and his disciples : for there were many that followed him .
GNV	Mark	2	16	And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with the Publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , How is it , that he eateth and drinketh with Publicans and sinners ?
GNV	Mark	2	17	Now when Jesus heard it , he said unto them , The whole have no need of the Physician , but the sick . ( D ) I came not to call the righteous , but the sinners to repentance .
GNV	Mark	2	18	( E ) [ j ] And the disciples of John , and the Pharisees did fast , and came and said unto him , Why do the disciples of John , and of the Pharisees fast , and thy disciples fast not ?
GNV	Mark	2	20	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
GNV	Mark	2	21	Also no man soweth a piece of new cloth in an old garment : for else the new piece that filled it up , taketh away somewhat from the old , and the breach is worse .
GNV	Mark	2	22	Likewise , no man putteth new wine into old vessels : for else the new wine breaketh the vessels , and the wine runneth out , and the vessels are lost ; but new wine must be put into new vessels .
GNV	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the Sabbath day , that which is not lawful ?
GNV	Mark	2	25	And he said to them , Have ye never read what ( G ) David did when he had need , and was an hungered , both he , and they that were with him ?

GNV	Mark	3	1	And ( A ) [ a ] he entered again into the Synagogue , and there was a man which had a [ b ] withered hand .
GNV	Mark	3	6	¶ [ f ] And the Pharisees departed , and straightway gathered a council with the [ g ] Herodians against him , that they might destroy him .
GNV	Mark	3	10	For he had healed many , insomuch that they pressed upon him to touch him , as many as had [ j ] plagues .
GNV	Mark	3	11	And when the [ k ] unclean spirits saw him , they fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
GNV	Mark	3	14	[ l ] And he [ m ] appointed twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them to preach .
GNV	Mark	3	24	For if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
GNV	Mark	3	29	But he that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost , shall never have forgiveness , but is culpable of eternal damnation .
GNV	Mark	3	33	But he answered them , saying , Who is my mother and my brethren ?
GNV	Mark	3	2	And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day , that they might accuse him .
GNV	Mark	3	4	And he said to them , Is it lawful to do a good deed on the Sabbath day , or to do evil ? to save the [ c ] life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
GNV	Mark	3	5	Then he looked round about on them [ d ] angrily , mourning also for the [ e ] hardness of their hearts , and said to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored , as whole as the other .
GNV	Mark	3	7	But Jesus avoided with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude followed him from Galilee , and from Judea ,
GNV	Mark	3	8	And from Jerusalem , and from Idumea , and [ h ] beyond Jordan : and they that dwelled about Tyre and Sidon , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him in great number .
GNV	Mark	3	9	And he commanded his disciples , that a little ship should [ i ] wait for him , because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
GNV	Mark	3	12	And he sharply rebuked them , to the end they should not utter him .
GNV	Mark	3	13	¶ ( B ) Then he went up into a mountain , and called unto him whom he would , and they came unto him .
GNV	Mark	3	15	And that they might have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
GNV	Mark	3	16	And the first was Simon , and he named Simon , Peter ,
GNV	Mark	3	17	Then James the son of Zebedee , and John James ’ brother ( and surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder . )
GNV	Mark	3	18	And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and [ n ] Thaddaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
GNV	Mark	3	19	And Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him , and they came [ o ] home .
GNV	Mark	3	20	And the multitude assembled again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
GNV	Mark	3	21	[ p ] And when his [ q ] kinsfolks heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said that he was beside himself .
GNV	Mark	3	22	¶ ( C ) And the Scribes which came down from Jerusalem , said , He hath Beelzebub , and through the prince of the devils he casteth out devils .
GNV	Mark	3	23	But he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan drive out Satan ?
GNV	Mark	3	25	Or if a house be divided against itself , that house can not continue .
GNV	Mark	3	26	So if [ r ] Satan make insurrection against himself , and be divided , he can not endure , but is at an end .
GNV	Mark	3	27	No man can enter into a strong man ’ s house , and take away his goods , except he first bind that strong man , and then spoil his house .
GNV	Mark	3	28	¶ ( D ) [ s ] Verily I say unto you , all sins shall be forgiven unto the children of men , and blasphemies , wherewith they blaspheme :
GNV	Mark	3	30	[ t ] Because they said , He had an unclean spirit .
GNV	Mark	3	31	¶ ( E ) Then came his [ u ] brethren and mother and stood without , and sent unto him , and called him .
GNV	Mark	3	32	And the people sat about him , and they said unto him , Behold , thy mother , and thy brethren seek for thee without .
GNV	Mark	3	34	[ v ] And he looked round about on them , which sat in compass about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren .
GNV	Mark	3	35	For whosoever doeth the will of God , he is my brother , my sister , and my mother .

GNV	Mark	4	14	The sower soweth the word .
GNV	Mark	4	18	Also they that receive the seed among the thorns , are such as hear the word :
GNV	Mark	4	21	¶ [ h ] Also he said unto them , ( D ) Cometh the candle in , to be put under a bushel , or under the bed , and not to be put in a candlestick ?
GNV	Mark	4	26	¶ [ j ] Also he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed in the ground .
GNV	Mark	4	31	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which when it is sown in the earth , is the least of all seeds that be in the earth :
GNV	Mark	4	38	And he was in the stern asleep on a pillow : and they awoke him , and said to him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
GNV	Mark	4	1	And ( A ) he began again to teach by the [ a ] seaside , and there gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat [ b ] in the sea , and all the people was by the seaside on the land .
GNV	Mark	4	2	And he taught them many things in parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
GNV	Mark	4	3	[ c ] Hearken : Behold , there went out a sower to sow .
GNV	Mark	4	5	And some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth , and by and by sprang up , because it had not depth of earth .
GNV	Mark	4	6	But as soon as the Sun was up , it was burnt up , and because it had not root , it withered away .
GNV	Mark	4	7	And some fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , so that it gave no fruit .
GNV	Mark	4	8	Some again fell in good ground , and did yield fruit that sprung up , and grew , and it brought forth , some thirtyfold , some sixtyfold , and some an hundredfold .
GNV	Mark	4	9	Then he said unto them , He that hath ears , to hear , let him hear .
GNV	Mark	4	10	And when he was [ d ] alone , they that were [ e ] about him with the twelve , asked him of the parable .
GNV	Mark	4	11	And he said unto them , To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are [ f ] without , all things be done in parables ,
GNV	Mark	4	12	( B ) That they seeing , may see , and not discern : and they hearing , may hear , and not understand , lest at any time they should turn , and their sins should be forgiven them .
GNV	Mark	4	13	Again he said unto them , Perceive ye not this parable ? how then should ye understand all other parables ?
GNV	Mark	4	15	And these are they that receive the seed by the wayside , in whom the word is sown : but when they have heard it , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
GNV	Mark	4	16	And likewise they that receive the seed in stony ground , are they , which when they have heard the word , straightway receive it with gladness .
GNV	Mark	4	17	Yet have they no root in themselves , and endure but a time : for when trouble and persecution ariseth for the word , immediately they be offended .
GNV	Mark	4	19	But the cares [ g ] of this world , and the ( C ) deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things enter in , and choke the word , and it is unfruitful .
GNV	Mark	4	20	But they that have received seed in good ground , are they that hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit : one corn thirty , another sixty , and some an hundred .
GNV	Mark	4	22	( E ) For there is nothing hid , that shall not be opened , neither is there a secret , but that it shall come to light .
GNV	Mark	4	23	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
GNV	Mark	4	24	[ i ] And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear . ( F ) With what measure you mete , it shall be measured unto you : and unto you that hear , shall more be given .
GNV	Mark	4	25	( G ) For unto him that hath , shall it be given , and from him that hath not , shall be taken away even that he hath .
GNV	Mark	4	27	And [ k ] should sleep , and rise up night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he [ l ] not knowing how .
GNV	Mark	4	28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit [ m ] of itself , first the blade , then the ears , after that full corn in the ears .
GNV	Mark	4	29	And as soon as the fruit showeth itself , anon he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
GNV	Mark	4	30	¶ ( H ) [ n ] He said moreover , Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
GNV	Mark	4	32	But after that it is sown , it groweth up , and is greatest of all herbs , and beareth great branches , so that the fowls of the heaven may build under the shadow of it .
GNV	Mark	4	33	And ( I ) with many such parables he preached the word unto them , [ o ] as they were able to hear it .
GNV	Mark	4	34	And without parables spake he nothing unto them : but he [ p ] expounded all things to his disciples apart .
GNV	Mark	4	35	¶ ( J ) Now the same day when even was come , he said unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side .
GNV	Mark	4	36	And they left the multitude , and took him as he was in the ship , and there was also with him other little ships .
GNV	Mark	4	37	[ q ] And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves dashed into the ship , so that it was now full .
GNV	Mark	4	39	And he arose up , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , and be still . So the wind ceased , and it was a great calm .
GNV	Mark	4	40	Then he said unto them , [ r ] Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
GNV	Mark	4	41	And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , Who is this , that both the wind and sea obey him ?

GNV	Mark	5	2	And when he was come out of the ship , there met him incontinently out of the graves , a man [ c ] which had an unclean spirit :
GNV	Mark	5	7	And cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus the Son of the most High God ? I [ d ] will that thou swear to me by God , that thou torment me not .
GNV	Mark	5	9	And he asked him , What is thy name ? and he answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many .
GNV	Mark	5	13	And incontinently Jesus gave them leave . Then the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine , and the herd ran headlong from the high bank into the [ g ] sea , ( and there were about two thousand swine ) and they were choked up in the sea .
GNV	Mark	5	22	( B ) And [ h ] behold , there came one of the rulers of the Synagogue , whose name was Jairus : and when he saw him , he fell down at his feet ,
GNV	Mark	5	25	( [ i ] And there was a certain woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years ,
GNV	Mark	5	26	And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and it availed her nothing , but she became much worse .
GNV	Mark	5	34	And he said to her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole : go in peace , and be whole of thy plague . )
GNV	Mark	5	39	And he went in , and said unto them , Why make ye this trouble , and weep ? the child is not dead , but sleepeth .
GNV	Mark	5	1	And ( A ) [ a ] they came over to the other side of the sea into the country of the [ b ] Gadarenes .
GNV	Mark	5	3	Who had his abiding among the graves , and no man could bind him , no not with chains :
GNV	Mark	5	4	Because that when he was often bound with fetters and chains , he plucked the chains asunder , and brake the fetters in pieces , neither could any man tame him .
GNV	Mark	5	6	And when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran , and worshipped him ,
GNV	Mark	5	8	( For he said unto him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit . )
GNV	Mark	5	10	And he [ e ] prayed him instantly , that he would not send them away out of the country .
GNV	Mark	5	11	Now there was there in the [ f ] mountains a great heard of swine , feeding .
GNV	Mark	5	12	And all the devils besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
GNV	Mark	5	14	And the swineherds fled , and told it in the city , and in the country , and they came out to see what it was that was done .
GNV	Mark	5	15	And they came to Jesus , and saw him that had been possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sit both clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
GNV	Mark	5	16	And they that saw it , told them , what was done to him that was possessed with the devil , and concerning the swine .
GNV	Mark	5	17	Then they began to pray him , that he would depart from their coasts .
GNV	Mark	5	18	And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil , prayed him that he might be with him .
GNV	Mark	5	19	Howbeit , Jesus would not suffer him , but said unto him , Go thy way home to thy friends , and show them what great things the Lord hath done unto thee , and how he hath had compassion on thee .
GNV	Mark	5	20	So he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis , what great things Jesus had done unto him : and all men did marvel .
GNV	Mark	5	21	¶ And when Jesus was come over again by ship unto the other side , a great multitude gathered together to him , and he was near unto the sea .
GNV	Mark	5	23	And besought him instantly , saying , My little daughter lieth at point of death : I pray thee that thou wouldest come and lay thine hands on her , that she may be healed , and live .
GNV	Mark	5	24	Then he went with him , and a great multitude followed him and thronged him .
GNV	Mark	5	27	When she had heard of Jesus , she came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
GNV	Mark	5	28	For she said , if I may but touch his clothes , I shall be whole .
GNV	Mark	5	29	And straightway the course of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body , that she was healed of that plague .
GNV	Mark	5	30	And immediately when Jesus did know in himself the virtue that went out of him , he turned him round about in the press , and said , Who hath touched my clothes ?
GNV	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude throng thee , and sayest thou , Who did touch me ?
GNV	Mark	5	32	And he looked round about , to see her that had done that .
GNV	Mark	5	33	And the woman feared and trembled : for she knew what was done in her , and she came and fell down before him , and told him the whole truth .
GNV	Mark	5	35	While he yet spake , there came from the same ruler of the Synagogue ’ s house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why diseasest thou the master any further ?
GNV	Mark	5	36	[ j ] As soon as Jesus heard that word spoken , he said unto the ruler of the Synagogue , Be not afraid : only believe .
GNV	Mark	5	37	And he suffered no man to follow him save Peter and James , and John the brother of James .
GNV	Mark	5	38	So he came unto the house of the ruler of the Synagogue , and saw the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
GNV	Mark	5	40	[ k ] And they laughed him to scorn : but he put them all out , and took the father , and the mother of the child , and them [ l ] that were with him , and entered in where the child lay ,
GNV	Mark	5	41	And took the child by the hand , and said unto her , Talitha cumi , which is by interpretation , Maiden , I say unto thee , arise .
GNV	Mark	5	42	And straightway the maiden arose , and walked : for she was of the age of twelve years , and they were astonied out of measure .

GNV	Mark	6	7	¶ ( D ) [ f ] And he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth two and two , and gave them power over unclean spirits ,
GNV	Mark	6	13	And they cast out many devils : and they ( H ) [ l ] anointed many that were sick , with oil , and healed them .

GNV	Mark	6	1	And ( A ) [ a ] he departed thence , and came into his own country , and his disciples followed him .
GNV	Mark	6	2	And when the Sabbath was come , he began to teach in the Synagogue , and many that heard him , were astonied , and said , From whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this that is given unto him , that even such [ b ] great works are done by his hands ?
GNV	Mark	6	4	And Jesus said unto them , A ( B ) Prophet is not without [ d ] honor , but in his own country , and among his own kindred , and in his own house .
GNV	Mark	6	5	And he [ e ] could there do no great works , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
GNV	Mark	6	8	[ g ] And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only : neither scrip , neither bread , neither money in their girdles :
GNV	Mark	6	9	But that they should be shod with ( E ) [ h ] sandals , and that they should not put on [ i ] two coats ,
GNV	Mark	6	10	And he said unto them , Wheresoever ye shall enter into an house , [ j ] there abide till ye depart thence .
GNV	Mark	6	11	¶ ( F ) [ k ] And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , ( G ) shake off the dust that is under your feet , for a witness unto them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be easier for Sodom , or Gomorrah at the day of Judgment , than for that city .
GNV	Mark	6	12	¶ And they went out , and preached , that men should amend their lives .
GNV	Mark	6	15	Others said , It is Elijah , and some said , It is a Prophet , or as one of [ o ] those Prophets .
GNV	Mark	6	16	( J ) So when Herod heard it , he said , It is John whom [ p ] I beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
GNV	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent forth , and had taken John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ’ sake , which was his brother Philip ’ s wife , because he had married her .
GNV	Mark	6	19	Therefore Herodias [ q ] laid wait against him : and would have killed him , but she could not :
GNV	Mark	6	20	For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man , and an holy , and reverenced him , and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him [ r ] gladly .
GNV	Mark	6	21	But the time being convenient , when Herod on his birthday made a banquet to his princes and captains , and chief estates of Galilee :
GNV	Mark	6	23	And he swore unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , even unto the half of my kingdom .
GNV	Mark	6	24	( L ) So [ t ] she went forth , and said to her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , John Baptist ’ s head .
GNV	Mark	6	25	Then she came in straightway with haste unto the King , and asked , saying , I would that thou shouldest give me even now in a charger the head of John Baptist .
GNV	Mark	6	26	Then the King was very sorry : yet for his oath ’ s sake , and for their sakes which sat at table with him , he would not refuse her .
GNV	Mark	6	28	And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the maid , and the maid gave it to her mother .
GNV	Mark	6	31	[ v ] And he said unto them , Come ye apart into the wilderness , and rest a while : for there were many comers and goers , that they had not leisure to eat .
GNV	Mark	6	32	( N ) So they went by ship out of the way into a desert place .
GNV	Mark	6	33	But the people saw them when they departed , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and came thither before them , and assembled unto him .
GNV	Mark	6	35	( Q ) And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , saying , This is a desert place , and now the day is far passed .
GNV	Mark	6	36	Let them depart , that they may go into the country and towns about , and buy them bread : for they have nothing to eat .
GNV	Mark	6	38	( R ) Then he said unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and look . And when they knew it , they said , Five , and two fishes .
GNV	Mark	6	39	So he commanded them to make them all sit down by [ y ] companies upon the green grass .
GNV	Mark	6	40	Then they sat down by [ z ] rows , by hundreds , and by fifties .
GNV	Mark	6	41	And he took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looked up to heaven , and gave thanks , and broke the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them , and the two fishes he divided among them all .
GNV	Mark	6	42	So they did all eat , and were satisfied .
GNV	Mark	6	43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
GNV	Mark	6	44	And they that had eaten , were about five thousand men .
GNV	Mark	6	45	¶ [ aa ] And straightway he caused his disciples to go into the ship , and to go before unto the other side unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
GNV	Mark	6	46	Then as soon as he had sent [ ab ] them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
GNV	Mark	6	47	( S ) And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
GNV	Mark	6	49	And when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out .
GNV	Mark	6	50	For they all saw him , and were sore afraid : but anon he talked with them , and said unto them , Be ye of good comfort : it is I , be not afraid .
GNV	Mark	6	51	Then he went up unto them into the ship , and the wind ceased , and they were [ ac ] much more amazed in themselves , and marveled .
GNV	Mark	6	52	For they had not [ ad ] considered the matter of the loaves , because their hearts were hardened .
GNV	Mark	6	53	¶ ( T ) And they came over , and went into the land of Gennesaret , and arrived .
GNV	Mark	6	54	[ ae ] So when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
GNV	Mark	6	55	And ran about throughout all that region round about , and began to carry hither and thither in couches all that were sick , where they heard that he was .

GNV	Mark	9	4	And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus .
GNV	Mark	9	5	Then Peter answered , and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : let us make also three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah .
GNV	Mark	9	6	Yet he knew not what he said : for they were [ d ] afraid .
GNV	Mark	9	8	And suddenly they looked round about , and saw no more any man save Jesus only with them .
GNV	Mark	9	10	So they [ f ] kept that matter to themselves , and [ g ] demanded one of another , what the rising from the dead again should mean .
GNV	Mark	9	12	And he answered , and said unto them , Elijah verily shall first come , and restore all things : and ( F ) as it is written of the Son of man , he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
GNV	Mark	9	13	But I say unto you , that Elijah is come , ( and they have done unto him whatsoever they would ) as it is written of him .

GNV	Mark	9	16	Then he asked the Scribes , What dispute you among yourselves ?
GNV	Mark	9	17	And one of the company answered , and said , Master , I have brought my son unto thee , which hath a dumb spirit :
GNV	Mark	9	18	And wheresoever he taketh him , he [ j ] teareth him , and he foameth , and gnasheth his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples , that they should cast him out , and they could not .
GNV	Mark	9	19	Then he answered him , and said , O faithless generation , how long now shall I be with you ! how long now shall I suffer you ! Bring him unto me .
GNV	Mark	9	20	So they brought him unto him : and as soon as the spirit [ k ] saw him , he tare him , and he fell down on the ground wallowing and foaming .
GNV	Mark	9	21	Then he asked his father , How long time is it since he hath been thus ? And he said , Of a child .

GNV	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took his hand , and lifted him up , and he arose .
GNV	Mark	9	28	[ n ] And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him secretly , Why could not we cast him out ?

GNV	Mark	10	46	¶ ( O ) [ q ] Then they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples , and a great multitude , Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus , a blind man , sat by the wayside , begging .
GNV	Mark	10	1	And ( A ) he [ a ] arose from thence , and went into the coasts of Judea by the far side of Jordan , and the people resorted unto him again , and as he was wont , he taught them again .
GNV	Mark	10	2	Then the Pharisees came and asked him , if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife , and tempted him .
GNV	Mark	10	3	And he answered , and said unto them , What did ( B ) Moses command you ?
GNV	Mark	10	4	And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
GNV	Mark	10	5	[ b ] Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote this [ c ] precept unto you .
GNV	Mark	10	6	But at the beginning of the creation ( C ) God made them male and female :
GNV	Mark	10	7	( D ) For this cause shall man leave his father and mother , and cleave unto his wife .
GNV	Mark	10	8	And they twain shall be one flesh : so that they are no more twain , but one flesh .
GNV	Mark	10	11	And he said unto them , ( F ) whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another , commiteth adultery [ d ] against her .
GNV	Mark	10	12	And if a woman put away her husband , and be married to another , she commiteth adultery .
GNV	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it , he was displeased , and said to them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
GNV	Mark	10	15	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God [ f ] as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
GNV	Mark	10	16	And he took them up in his arms , and put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
GNV	Mark	10	18	Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , even God .
GNV	Mark	10	19	. For Moses gave them no commandment to put away their wives , but rather made a good provision for the wives against the stubborn hardness of their husbands . - Mark 10:11 Whom he putteth away , for he is an adulterer by keeping company with another . - Mark 10:13 God of his goodness comprehendeth in the covenant not only the fathers , but the children also : and therefore he blesseth them . - Mark 10:15 We must in malice become children , if we will enter into the kingdom of heaven . - Mark 10:17 Two things are chiefly to be eschewed of them which earnestly seek eternal life : that is to say , an opinion of their merits or deservings , which is not only understood , but condemned by the due consideration of the Law : and the love of riches , which turneth aside many , from that race wherein they ran with a good courage . - Mark 10:19 Neither by force nor deceit , nor any other means whatsoever . - Mark 10:28 To neglect all things in comparison of Christ , is a sure way unto eternal life , so that we fall not away by the way . - Mark 10:30 An hundredfold as much , if we look to the true use and commodities of this life , so that we measure them after the will of God , and not after the wealth itself , and our greedy desire . - Mark 10:30 Even in the midst of persecutions . - Mark 10:32 The disciples are again prepared to patience , not to be overcome by the foretelling unto them of his death , which was at hand , and therewithall of life which should most certainly follow . - Mark 10:35 We must first strive , before we triumph . - Mark 10:35 We pray thee . - Mark 10:42 The Magistrates according to God ’ s appointment , rule over their subjects : but the Pastors are not called to rule , but to serve , according to the example of the Son of God himself , who went before them , for so much as he also was a Minister of his Father ’ s will . - Mark 10:42 They to whom it is decreed and appointed . - Mark 10:46 Christ only , being called upon by faith , healeth our blindness .

GNV	Mark	10	20	Then he answered , and said to him , Master , all these things have I observed from my youth .
GNV	Mark	10	21	And Jesus looked upon him , and loved him , and said unto him , One thing is lacking unto thee . Go and sell all that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , follow me , and take up the cross .
GNV	Mark	10	22	But he was sad at that saying , and went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
GNV	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked round about , and said unto his disciples , How hardly do they that have riches , enter into the kingdom of God !
GNV	Mark	10	24	And his disciples were afraid at his words . But Jesus answered again , and said unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches , to enter into the kingdom of God !
GNV	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
GNV	Mark	10	26	And they were much more astonied , saying with themselves , Who then can be saved ?
GNV	Mark	10	27	But Jesus looked upon them , and said , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
GNV	Mark	10	29	Jesus answered , and said , Verily I say unto you , there is no man that hath forsaken house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands for my sake and the Gospels ,
GNV	Mark	10	30	But he shall receive an [ j ] hundredfold , now at this present , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands [ k ] with persecutions , and in the world to come , eternal life .
GNV	Mark	10	31	( K ) But many that are first , shall be last , and the last , first .
GNV	Mark	10	32	¶ ( L ) [ l ] And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus went before them , and they were troubled , and as they followed , they were afraid , and Jesus took the twelve again , and began to tell them what things should come unto him ,
GNV	Mark	10	34	And they shall mock him , and scourge him , and spit upon him , and kill him : but the third day he shall rise again .
GNV	Mark	10	36	And he said unto them , What would ye I should do for you ?
GNV	Mark	10	37	And they said to him , Grant unto us , that we may sit , one at thy right hand , and the other at thy left hand in thy glory .
GNV	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask . Can ye drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and be baptized with the baptism that I shall be baptized with ?
GNV	Mark	10	39	And they said unto him , We can . But Jesus said unto them , Ye shall drink indeed of the cup that I shall drink of , and be baptized with the baptism wherewith I shall be baptized :
GNV	Mark	10	40	But to sit at my right hand and at my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
GNV	Mark	10	41	And when the ten heard that , they began to disdain at James and John .
GNV	Mark	10	42	[ o ] But Jesus called them unto him , and said to them , ( N ) Ye know that [ p ] they which are princes among the Gentiles , have domination over them , and they that be great among them , exercise authority over them .
GNV	Mark	10	43	But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your servant .
GNV	Mark	10	44	And whosoever will be chief of you , shall be the servant of all .
GNV	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of man came not to be served , but to serve , and to give his life for the ransom of many .
GNV	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry , and to say , Jesus the Son of David , have mercy on me .
GNV	Mark	10	48	And many rebuked him , because he should hold his peace : but he cried much more , O Son of David , have mercy on me .
GNV	Mark	10	49	Then Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called : and they called the blind , saying unto him , Be of good comfort : arise , he calleth thee .
GNV	Mark	10	50	So he threw away his cloak , and rose , and came to Jesus .
GNV	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answered , and said unto him , What wilt thou that I do unto thee ? And the blind said unto him , Lord , that I may receive sight .
GNV	Mark	10	52	Then Jesus said unto him , Go thy way : thy faith hath saved thee . And by and by he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .

GNV	Mark	11	1	And ( A ) [ a ] when they came near to Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany unto the mount of Olives , he sent forth two of his disciples ,
GNV	Mark	11	13	[ d ] And seeing a fig tree afar off , that had leaves , he went to see if he might find anything thereon : but when he came unto it , he found nothing but leaves : for the time of figs was not yet .
GNV	Mark	11	15	¶ [ e ] And they came to Jerusalem , and Jesus went into the Temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the Temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves .
GNV	Mark	11	23	For verily I say unto you , that whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken away , and cast into the sea , and shall not waver in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith , shall come to pass , whatsoever he saith , shall be done to him .
GNV	Mark	11	24	( H ) Therefore I say unto you , Whatsoever ye desire when ye pray , believe that [ j ] ye shall have it , and it shall be done unto you .
GNV	Mark	11	25	( I ) But when [ k ] ye shall stand , and pray , forgive , if ye have anything against any man , that your Father also which is in heaven , may forgive you your trespasses .
GNV	Mark	11	27	¶ ( J ) [ l ] Then they came again to Jerusalem : and as he walked in the Temple , there came to him the high Priests , and the Scribes , and the Elders ,
GNV	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? answer me .
GNV	Mark	11	2	And said unto them , Go your ways into that town that is over against you , and as soon as ye shall enter into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat : loose him , and bring him .
GNV	Mark	11	3	And if any man say unto you , Why do ye this ? Say that the Lord hath need of him , and straightway he will send him hither .
GNV	Mark	11	4	And they went their way , and found a colt , tied by the door without , in a place where two ways met , and they loosed him .
GNV	Mark	11	5	Then certain of them , that stood there , said unto them , What do ye loosing the colt ?
GNV	Mark	11	6	And they said unto them , as Jesus had commanded them : So they let them go .
GNV	Mark	11	7	¶ ( B ) And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him , and he sat upon him .
GNV	Mark	11	8	And many spread their garments in the way : others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
GNV	Mark	11	9	And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna : [ b ] blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord .
GNV	Mark	11	10	[ c ] Blessed be the kingdom that cometh in the Name of the Lord of our father David : Hosanna , O thou which art in the highest heavens .
GNV	Mark	11	12	( D ) And on the morrow when they were come out from Bethany , he was hungry .
GNV	Mark	11	14	Then Jesus answered , and said to it , Never man eat fruit of thee hereafter while the world standeth : and his disciples heard it .
GNV	Mark	11	16	Neither would he suffer that any man should carry a [ f ] vessel through the Temple .
GNV	Mark	11	17	And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , ( E ) Mine house shall be [ g ] called the house of prayer unto all nations ? ( F ) but you have made it a den of thieves .
GNV	Mark	11	18	And the Scribes and high Priests heard it , and sought how to destroy him : for they feared him , because the whole multitude was astonied at his doctrine .
GNV	Mark	11	19	But when even was come , Jesus went out of the city .
GNV	Mark	11	20	( G ) [ h ] And in the morning as they journeyed together , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
GNV	Mark	11	21	Then Peter remembered , and said unto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst , is withered .
GNV	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answered , and said unto them , Have [ i ] the faith of God .
GNV	Mark	11	26	For if you will not forgive , your Father which is in heaven , will not pardon you your trespasses .
GNV	Mark	11	28	And said unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority , that thou shouldest do these things ?
GNV	Mark	11	29	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , I will also ask you a certain thing , and answer ye me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
GNV	Mark	11	31	And they thought with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven , he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
GNV	Mark	11	32	[ m ] But if we say , Of men , we fear the people : for all men counted John that he was a Prophet indeed .
GNV	Mark	11	33	Then they answered , and said unto Jesus , We can not tell . And Jesus answered , and said unto them , Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .

GNV	Mark	12	10	Have ye not read so much as this Scripture , ( B ) The stone which the builders did refuse , is made the head of the corner .
GNV	Mark	12	18	¶ ( E ) [ h ] Then came the Sadducees unto him , ( which say , there is no resurrection ) and they asked him , saying ,
GNV	Mark	12	28	¶ ( H ) [ i ] Then came one of the Scribes that had heard them disputing together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , he asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
GNV	Mark	12	31	And the second is like , that is , ( J ) Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these .
GNV	Mark	12	36	For David himself said by [ k ] the holy Ghost , ( L ) The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
GNV	Mark	12	38	( M ) [ l ] Moreover he said unto them in [ m ] his doctrine , Beware of the Scribes which love to go in [ n ] long robes , and love salutations in the markets ,
GNV	Mark	12	42	And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a quadrin .
GNV	Mark	12	1	And [ a ] he began to speak unto them in [ b ] parables , ( A ) A certain man planted a vineyard , and compassed it with an hedge , and dug a pit for the winepress , and built a tower in it , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a strange country .
GNV	Mark	12	2	[ c ] And at the time , he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
GNV	Mark	12	3	But they took him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
GNV	Mark	12	4	And again he sent unto them another servant , and at him they cast stones , and brake his head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
GNV	Mark	12	5	And again he sent another , and him they slew , and many others , beating some , and killing some .
GNV	Mark	12	6	Yet had he one son , his dear beloved : him also he sent the last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
GNV	Mark	12	7	But the husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
GNV	Mark	12	8	So they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
GNV	Mark	12	9	What shall then the Lord of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy these husbandmen , and give the vineyard to others .
GNV	Mark	12	11	This was done of the Lord , and it is marvelous in our eyes .
GNV	Mark	12	13	¶ ( C ) [ e ] And they sent unto him certain of the Pharisees , and of the Herodians , that they might take him in his talk .
GNV	Mark	12	14	And when they came , they said unto him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou [ f ] considerest not the person of men , but teachest the [ g ] way of God truly , Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
GNV	Mark	12	15	Should we give it , or should we not give it ? but he knew their hypocrisy , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? Bring me a penny , that I may see it .
GNV	Mark	12	16	So they brought it , and he said unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? and they said unto him , Caesar ’ s .
GNV	Mark	12	17	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , ( D ) Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God , those that are God ’ s : and they marveled at him .
GNV	Mark	12	19	Master , ( F ) Moses wrote unto us , If any man ’ s brother die , and leave his wife , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
GNV	Mark	12	20	There were seven brethren , and the first took a wife , and when he died , left no issue .
GNV	Mark	12	21	Then the second took her , and he died , neither did he yet leave issue , and the third likewise :
GNV	Mark	12	22	So these seven had her , and left no issue : last of all the wife died also .
GNV	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection then , when they shall rise again , whose wife shall she be of them ? for seven had her to wife .
GNV	Mark	12	24	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , Are ye not therefore deceived , because ye know not the Scriptures , neither the power of God ?
GNV	Mark	12	25	For when they shall rise again from the dead , neither men marry , nor wives are married , but are as the Angels which are in heaven .
GNV	Mark	12	26	And as touching the dead , that they shall rise again , have ye not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I ( G ) am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
GNV	Mark	12	27	God is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living . Ye are therefore greatly deceived .
GNV	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , ( I ) Hear , Israel , The Lord our God is the only Lord .
GNV	Mark	12	30	Thou shalt therefore love the Lord thy God with all thine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
GNV	Mark	12	32	Then that Scribe said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth , that there is one God , and that there is none but he ,
GNV	Mark	12	33	And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
GNV	Mark	12	34	Then when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question .
GNV	Mark	12	35	¶ ( K ) [ j ] And Jesus answered and said teaching in the Temple , How say the Scribes that Christ is the son of David ?
GNV	Mark	12	37	Then David himself calleth him Lord : by what means is he then his son ? and much people heard him gladly .
GNV	Mark	12	39	And the chief seats in the Synagogues , and the first rooms at feasts ,
GNV	Mark	12	40	Which ( N ) devour widows ’ houses , even under a color of long prayers . These shall receive the greater damnation .
GNV	Mark	12	41	( O ) [ o ] And as Jesus sat over against the treasury , he beheld how the people [ p ] cast money into the treasury , and many rich men cast in much .
GNV	Mark	12	43	Then he called unto him his disciples , and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury .
GNV	Mark	12	44	For they all did cast in of their superfluity : but she of her poverty did cast in all that she had , even all her living .

GNV	Mark	13	9	But take ye heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to the Councils , and to the Synagogues : ye shall be beaten , and brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a [ b ] testimonial unto them .

GNV	Mark	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of man , coming in the clouds , with great power and glory .
GNV	Mark	13	33	( J ) Take heed : watch , and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
GNV	Mark	13	1	( A ) And [ a ] as he went out of the Temple , one of his disciples said unto him , Master , see what manner stones , and what manner buildings are here .
GNV	Mark	13	2	( B ) Then Jesus answered and said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down .
GNV	Mark	13	3	And as he sat on the mount of Olives , over against the Temple , Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew asked him secretly ,
GNV	Mark	13	4	Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
GNV	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answered them , and began to say , ( C ) Take heed lest any man deceive you .
GNV	Mark	13	6	For many shall come in my Name , saying , I am Christ , and shall deceive many .
GNV	Mark	13	7	Furthermore when ye shall hear of wars , and rumors of wars , be ye not troubled , for such things must needs be : but the end shall not be yet .
GNV	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be earthquakes in divers quarters , and there shall be famine and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
GNV	Mark	13	11	( D ) But when they lead you , and deliver you up , [ c ] be not careful before hand , [ d ] neither study what ye shall say : but what is given you at the same time , that speak : for it is not you that speak , but the holy Ghost .
GNV	Mark	13	12	Yea , and the brother shall deliver the brother to death , and the father the son , and the children shall rise against their parents , and shall cause them to die .
GNV	Mark	13	14	( E ) Moreover , when ye shall see the abomination of desolation ( spoken of by ( F ) Daniel the Prophet ) [ f ] set where it ought not , ( let him that readeth , consider it ) then let them that be in Judea , flee into the mountains .
GNV	Mark	13	15	And let him that is upon the house , not come down into the house , neither enter therein , to fetch anything out of his house .
GNV	Mark	13	16	And let him that is in the field , not turn back again to take his garment .
GNV	Mark	13	17	Then woe shall be to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days .
GNV	Mark	13	18	Pray therefore that your flight be not in the winter .
GNV	Mark	13	19	For [ g ] those days shall be such tribulation , as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .

GNV	Mark	13	22	For false Christs shall rise , and false prophets , and shall show signs and wonders , to deceive if it were possible the very elect .

GNV	Mark	13	32	[ h ] But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the Angels which are in heaven , neither the Son himself , but the Father .
GNV	Mark	13	34	For the Son of man is as a man going into a strange country , and leaveth his house , and giveth authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commandeth the porter to watch .

GNV	Mark	14	1	And ( A ) [ a ] two days after followed the feast of the Passover , and of unleavened bread : and the high Priests , and Scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
GNV	Mark	14	3	( B ) And when he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at table , there came a woman having a box of ointment of Spikenard , very costly , and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
GNV	Mark	14	12	¶ ( D ) [ g ] Now the first day of unleavened bread , [ h ] when [ i ] they sacrificed the [ j ] Passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare , that thou mayest eat the Passover ?
GNV	Mark	14	22	( G ) And as they did eat , Jesus took the bread , and when he had given thanks , he brake it and gave it to them , and said , Take , eat , this is my body .
GNV	Mark	14	41	And he came the third time , and said unto them , Sleep henceforth , and take your rest : it is enough : the hour is come : behold , the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners .
GNV	Mark	14	43	( L ) [ t ] And immediately while he yet spake , came Judas that was one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the high Priests , and Scribes , and Elders .
GNV	Mark	14	53	( M ) So they led Jesus away to the high Priest , and to him came [ z ] together all the high Priests , and the Elders , and the Scribes .
GNV	Mark	14	66	( Q ) [ ad ] And as Peter was beneath in the hall , there came one of the maids of the high Priest .
GNV	Mark	14	2	But they said , Not in the feast day , lest there be any tumult among the people .
GNV	Mark	14	4	[ b ] Therefore some disdained among themselves , and said , To what end is this waste of ointment ?
GNV	Mark	14	5	For it might have been sold for more than [ c ] three hundred pence , and been given unto the poor , and they murmured against her .
GNV	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , Let her alone : Why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
GNV	Mark	14	7	[ d ] For ye have the poor with you always , and when ye will ye may do them good , but me ye shall not have always .
GNV	Mark	14	8	[ e ] She hath done that she could : she came aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
GNV	Mark	14	9	Verily I say unto you , wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done , shall be spoken of in remembrance of her .
GNV	Mark	14	10	¶ ( C ) [ f ] Then Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went away unto the high Priests , to betray him unto them .
GNV	Mark	14	11	And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised that they would give him money : therefore he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
GNV	Mark	14	13	Then he sent forth two of his disciples , and said unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
GNV	Mark	14	15	And he will show you an [ k ] upper chamber which is large , trimmed and prepared : there make it ready for us .
GNV	Mark	14	16	So his disciples went forth , and came to the city , and found as he had said unto them , and made ready the Passover .
GNV	Mark	14	17	¶ And at even he came with the twelve .
GNV	Mark	14	18	( E ) [ l ] And as they sat at table and did eat , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me , which eateth with me .
GNV	Mark	14	19	Then they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one , Is it I ? And another , Is it I ?
GNV	Mark	14	20	And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve that [ m ] dippeth with me in the platter .
GNV	Mark	14	21	Truly the Son of man goeth his way , as it is written of him : ( F ) but woe be to that man , by whom the Son of man is betrayed : it had been good for that man , if he had never been born .
GNV	Mark	14	23	Also he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
GNV	Mark	14	24	And he said unto them , This is my blood of that new Testament which is shed for many .
GNV	Mark	14	25	Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day , that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
GNV	Mark	14	26	And when they had sung a Psalm , they went out to the mount of Olives .
GNV	Mark	14	27	¶ ( H ) [ n ] Then Jesus said unto them , All ye shall be offended by me this night : for it is written , ( I ) I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
GNV	Mark	14	28	But after that I am risen , I will go into ( J ) Galilee before you .
GNV	Mark	14	29	[ o ] And Peter said unto him , Although all men should be offended at thee , yet would not I .
GNV	Mark	14	30	Then Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , this day , even in this night before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
GNV	Mark	14	31	But he said [ p ] more earnestly , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee : likewise also said they all .
GNV	Mark	14	32	¶ ( K ) [ q ] After , they came into a place named Gethsemane : then he said to his disciples , Sit ye here , till I have prayed .
GNV	Mark	14	33	And he took with him Peter , and James , and John , and he began to be troubled , and in great heaviness ,
GNV	Mark	14	34	And said unto them , My soul is very heavy , even unto the death : tarry here , and watch .
GNV	Mark	14	35	So he went forward a little , and fell down on the ground , and prayed , that if it were possible , that hour might pass from him ,
GNV	Mark	14	36	And he said , [ r ] Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee : take away this cup from me : nevertheless not that I will , but that thou wilt , be done .
GNV	Mark	14	37	[ s ] Then he came , and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
GNV	Mark	14	38	¶ Watch ye , and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is ready , but the flesh is weak .
GNV	Mark	14	39	And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
GNV	Mark	14	40	And he returned , and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy : neither knew they what they should answer him .
GNV	Mark	14	42	Rise up : let us go : lo , he that betrayeth me , is at hand .
GNV	Mark	14	44	And he that betrayed him , had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , he it is : take him and lead him away [ u ] safely .
GNV	Mark	14	45	And as soon as he was come , he went straightway to him , and said , Hail Master , and kissed him .
GNV	Mark	14	46	Then they laid their hands on him , and took him .
GNV	Mark	14	47	And [ v ] one of them that stood by , drew out a sword , and smote a servant of the high Priest , and cut off his ear .
GNV	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answered , and said to them , Ye be come out as against a thief , with swords and with staves , to take me .
GNV	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you , teaching in the Temple , and ye took me not : but this is done that the Scriptures should be fulfilled .
GNV	Mark	14	50	Then they [ w ] all forsook him , and fled .
GNV	Mark	14	51	[ x ] And there followed him a certain young man , clothed in [ y ] linen upon his bare body , and the young men caught him .
GNV	Mark	14	52	But he left his linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
GNV	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed him afar off , even into the hall of the high Priest , and sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
GNV	Mark	14	55	[ aa ] And the ( N ) high Priests , and all the Council sought for witness against Jesus , to put him to death , but found none .
GNV	Mark	14	56	For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
GNV	Mark	14	57	Then there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
GNV	Mark	14	58	We heard him say , ( O ) I will destroy this Temple made with hands , and within three days I will build another , made without hands .
GNV	Mark	14	59	But their witness yet agreed not together .
GNV	Mark	14	60	Then the high Priest stood up amongst them , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is the matter that these bear witness against thee ?
GNV	Mark	14	61	But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high Priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou that Christ the son of the [ ab ] Blessed ?
GNV	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , I am he , ( P ) and ye shall see the Son of man sit at the right hand of the power of God , and come in the clouds of heaven .
GNV	Mark	14	63	Then the high Priest rent his clothes , and said , What have we anymore need of witnesses ?
GNV	Mark	14	64	Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death .
GNV	Mark	14	65	[ ac ] And some began to spit at him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fists , and to say unto him , Prophesy . And the sergeants smote him with their rods .
GNV	Mark	14	67	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked on him , and said , Thou wast also with Jesus of Nazareth .
GNV	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , I know him not , neither wot I what thou sayest . Then he went out into the porch , and the cock crew .
GNV	Mark	14	69	( R ) Then [ ae ] a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
GNV	Mark	14	70	But he denied it again : and anon after , they that stood by , said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art of Galilee , and thy speech is like .
GNV	Mark	14	71	And he began to curse , and swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
GNV	Mark	14	72	( S ) Then the second time the cock crew , and Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice , and weighing that with himself , he wept .

GNV	Mark	15	37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
GNV	Mark	15	43	( L ) Joseph of Arimathea , an [ l ] honorable counselor , which also looked for the kingdom of God , came , and went in [ m ] boldly unto Pilate , and asked the body of Jesus .
GNV	Mark	15	2	Then Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered , and said unto him , Thou sayest it .
GNV	Mark	15	3	And the high Priests accused him of many things .
GNV	Mark	15	4	( B ) Wherefore Pilate asked him again , saying , Answered thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
GNV	Mark	15	5	But Jesus answered no more at all , so that Pilate marveled .
GNV	Mark	15	6	Now at the feast , Pilate [ c ] did deliver a prisoner unto them , whomsoever they would desire .
GNV	Mark	15	7	Then there was one named Barabbas , which was bound with his fellows , that had made insurrection , who in the insurrection had committed murder .
GNV	Mark	15	8	And the people cried aloud , and began to desire that he would do as he had ever done unto them .
GNV	Mark	15	9	Then Pilate answered them , and said , Will ye that I let loose unto you the King of the Jews ?
GNV	Mark	15	10	For he knew that the high Priests had delivered him of envy .
GNV	Mark	15	12	And Pilate answered , and said again unto them , What will ye then that I do with him , whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
GNV	Mark	15	13	And they cried again , Crucify him .
GNV	Mark	15	14	Then Pilate said unto them , But what evil hath he done ? And they cried the more fervently , Crucify him .
GNV	Mark	15	16	Then the soldiers led him away into the hall , which is the common hall , and called together the whole band ,
GNV	Mark	15	18	And began to salute him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews .
GNV	Mark	15	20	And when they had mocked him , they took the purple off him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
GNV	Mark	15	22	( D ) [ f ] And they brought him to a place named Golgotha , which is by interpretation , the place of dead mens ’ skulls .
GNV	Mark	15	23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
GNV	Mark	15	24	( E ) [ g ] And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots for them , what every man should have .
GNV	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour when they crucified him .
GNV	Mark	15	28	Thus the Scripture was fulfilled , which saith , ( F ) And he was counted among the wicked .
GNV	Mark	15	29	And they that went by , railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , ( G ) Hey , thou that destroyest the Temple , and buildest it in three days ,
GNV	Mark	15	30	Save thyself , and come down from the cross .
GNV	Mark	15	31	Likewise also even the high Priests mocking , said among themselves with the Scribes , He saved other men , himself he can not save .
GNV	Mark	15	32	Let Christ the king of Israel now come down from the cross , that we may see , and believe . They also that were crucified with him , reviled him .
GNV	Mark	15	33	¶ Now when the sixth hour was come , [ h ] darkness arose over [ i ] all the land until the ninth hour .
GNV	Mark	15	34	And at the [ j ] ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , ( H ) Eloi , Eloi , lama-sabachthani ? which is by interpretation , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
GNV	Mark	15	35	And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elijah .
GNV	Mark	15	36	And one ran , and filled a ( I ) sponge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let him alone : let us see if Elijah will come , and take him down .
GNV	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the Temple was rent in twain , from the top to the bottom .
GNV	Mark	15	39	Now when the Centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he thus crying gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
GNV	Mark	15	40	¶ [ k ] There were also women which beheld afar off , among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less , and of Joses , and Salome ,
GNV	Mark	15	41	Which also when he was in Galilee , ( J ) followed him , and ministered unto him , and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem .
GNV	Mark	15	42	( K ) And now when the night was come ( because it was the day of the preparation that is before the Sabbath )
GNV	Mark	15	44	And Pilate marveled , if he were already dead , and called unto him the Centurion , and asked of him whether he had been any while dead .
GNV	Mark	15	45	And when he knew the truth of the Centurion , he gave the body to Joseph :
GNV	Mark	15	46	Who bought a linen cloth , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulcher :
GNV	Mark	15	47	And Mary Magdalene , and Mary Joses ’ mother , beheld where he should be laid . Footnotes - Mark 15:1 Christ being bound before the judgment seat of an earthly judge , in open assembly is condemned as guilty unto the death of the cross , not for his own sins , ( as appeareth by the judge ’ s own words ) but for all ours , that we most guilty creatures being delivered from the guiltiness of our sins , might be quitted before the judgment seat of God , even in the open assembly of the Angels . - Mark 15:1 It was not lawful for them to put any man to death , for all causes of life and death were taken away from them , first by Herod the great , and afterward by the Romans , about forty years before the destruction of the Temple , and therefore they deliver Jesus to Pilate . - Mark 15:6 Used Pilate to deliver . - Mark 15:17 Christ going about to take away the sins of men , who went about to usurp the throne of God himself , is condemned as one that hunted after the kingdom , and mocked with a false show of a kingdom , that we on the other side , who shall indeed be eternal kings , might receive the crown of glory at God ’ s own hand . - Mark 15:21 The rage of the wicked hath no measure , but in the mean season , even the weakness of Christ , being in pain under the heavy burden of the cross , doth manifestly show that a lamb is led to be sacrificed . - Mark 15:22 Christ is led out of the walls of the earthly Jerusalem , into a foul place of dead men ’ s carcasses , as a man most unclean , not touching himself , but touching our sins , which were laid upon him , to the end that we being made clean by his blood , might be brought into the heavenly Sanctuary . - Mark 15:24 Christ hangeth naked upon the cross , and as the most wickedest caitiff that ever was , most vilely reproved : that we being clothed with his righteousness , and blessed with his curses , and sanctified by his only oblation , may be taken up into heaven . - Mark 15:33 How angry God was against our sin , which he punished in our surety , his son , it appeareth by this horrible darkness . - Mark 15:33 By this word , land , he meaneth Palestine : so that the strangeness of the wonder , is so much the more set forth in that , that at the feast of the Passover , and in the full moon , when the Sun shined over all the rest of the world and at midday that corner of the world , wherein so wicked an act was committed , was overcovered with most gross darkness . - Mark 15:34 Christ striving mightily with Satan , with sin , and with death , all three armed with the horrible curse of God , grievously tormented in body hanging upon the cross , and in soul plunged in the depth of hell , yet he riddeth himself , crying with a mighty voice : and notwithstanding the wound which he received of death in that that he died , yet by smiting both things above and things beneath , by renting of the veil of the Temple , and by the testimony wrung out of them which murdered him , he showeth evidently unto the rest of his enemies which are as yet obstinate , and mock at him , that he shall be known out of hand to be conqueror and Lord of all . - Mark 15:40 Christ to the great shame of men which forsook the Lord , chose women for his witnesses , which beheld all this whole action . - Mark 15:43 A man of great authority , of the counsel of the Sanhedrin , or else taken into counsel by Pilate . - Mark 15:43 If we consider what danger Joseph cast himself into , we shall perceive how bold he was .

GNV	Mark	16	1	And ( A ) when the Sabbath day was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Salome , bought sweet ointments , that they might come and anoint him .
GNV	Mark	16	9	¶ [ c ] And when Jesus was risen again , early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , ( D ) out of whom he had cast seven devils :
GNV	Mark	16	15	[ f ] And he said unto them , ( G ) Go ye into all the world , and preach the Gospel to [ g ] every creature .
GNV	Mark	16	19	( M ) [ i ] So after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received into heaven , and sat at the right hand of God .
GNV	Mark	16	2	Therefore early in the morning , the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulcher , when the Sun was now risen .
GNV	Mark	16	3	And they said one to another , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher ?
GNV	Mark	16	4	And when they [ a ] looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away ( for it was a very great one )
GNV	Mark	16	5	( B ) So they went into the [ b ] sepulcher , and saw a young man sitting at the right side , clothed in a long white robe : and they were sore troubled .
GNV	Mark	16	6	But he said unto them , Be not so troubled : ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , which hath been crucified : he is risen , he is not here : behold the place where they put him .
GNV	Mark	16	7	But go your way , and tell his disciples , and Peter , that he will go before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , ( C ) as he said unto you .
GNV	Mark	16	8	And they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulcher : for they trembled , and were amazed : neither said they anything to any man : for they were afraid .
GNV	Mark	16	10	And she went and told them that had been with him , which mourned and wept .
GNV	Mark	16	11	And when they heard that he was alive , and had appeared to her , they believed it not .
GNV	Mark	16	12	¶ ( E ) [ d ] After that , he appeared unto two of them in another form , as they walked and went into the country .
GNV	Mark	16	13	And they went and told it to the remnant , neither believed they them .
GNV	Mark	16	14	¶ ( F ) [ e ] Finally , he appeared unto the eleven as they sat together , and reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him , being risen up again .
GNV	Mark	16	17	And these tokens shall follow them that believe , ( I ) In my Name they shall cast out devils , and ( J ) shall speak with [ h ] new tongues ,
GNV	Mark	16	18	( K ) And shall take away serpents , and if they shall drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them : ( L ) they shall lay their hands on the sick , and they shall recover .

GNV	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as [ a ] many have [ b ] taken in hand to set forth the story of those things , whereof we are fully persuaded ,

GNV	Luke	1	5	In [ g ] the [ h ] time of [ i ] Herod King of Judea , there was a certain Priest named Zacharias , of the ( A ) [ j ] course of Abijah : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
GNV	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great in the [ p ] sight of the Lord , and shall neither drink wine , nor [ q ] strong drink : and he shall be filled with the holy Ghost , even from his mother ’ s womb .
GNV	Luke	1	20	And behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not be able to speak , until the day that these things be done , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
GNV	Luke	1	26	¶ [ x ] And in the sixth month , the Angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
GNV	Luke	1	39	¶ [ al ] And Mary arose in those days , and went into the [ am ] hill country with haste to a [ an ] city of Judah ,
GNV	Luke	1	46	[ aq ] Then Mary said , My soul magnifieth the Lord ,
GNV	Luke	1	68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel , because he hath [ bi ] visited ( Q ) and [ bj ] redeemed his people ,
GNV	Luke	1	76	And thou , [ bn ] babe , shalt be called the Prophet of the most High : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ,
GNV	Luke	1	2	[ c ] As they have delivered them unto us , which from the beginning saw them themselves , and were ministers of the word ,
GNV	Luke	1	3	It seemed good also to me ( [ d ] most noble Theophilus ) as soon as I had searched out perfectly all things [ e ] from the beginning , to write unto thee thereof from point to point ,
GNV	Luke	1	4	That thou mightest [ f ] acknowledge the certainty of those things whereof thou hast been instructed .
GNV	Luke	1	6	Both were [ k ] just before God , and [ l ] walked in all the [ m ] commandments and ordinances of the Lord , [ n ] without reproof .
GNV	Luke	1	7	And they had no child , because that Elizabeth was barren : and both were well stricken in age .
GNV	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass , as he executed the Priest ’ s office before God , as his course came in order ,
GNV	Luke	1	9	( B ) According to the custom of the Priest ’ s office , his lot was to burn incense , when he went into the [ o ] Temple of the Lord .
GNV	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were without in prayer , ( C ) while the incense was burning .
GNV	Luke	1	11	Then appeared unto him an Angel of the Lord , standing at the right side of the Altar of incense .
GNV	Luke	1	12	And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
GNV	Luke	1	13	But the Angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard , and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
GNV	Luke	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness , and many shall rejoice at his birth .
GNV	Luke	1	16	( D ) And many of the children of Israel shall he [ r ] turn to their Lord God .
GNV	Luke	1	17	( E ) For he shall go [ s ] before him [ t ] in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the [ u ] hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the [ v ] wisdom of the just men , to make ready a people prepared for the Lord .
GNV	Luke	1	18	Then Zacharias said unto the Angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife is of a great age .
GNV	Luke	1	19	And the Angel answered , and said unto him , I am Gabriel [ w ] that stand in the presence of God , and am sent to speak unto thee , and to show thee these good tidings .
GNV	Luke	1	21	Now the people waited for Zacharias , and marveled that he tarried so long in the Temple .
GNV	Luke	1	22	And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : then they perceived that he had seen a vision in the Temple : for he made signs unto them , and remained dumb .
GNV	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , when the days of his office were fulfilled , that he departed to his own house .
GNV	Luke	1	24	And after those days , his wife Elizabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
GNV	Luke	1	25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me , in the days wherein he looked on me , to take from me my rebuke among men .
GNV	Luke	1	27	( F ) To a virgin affianced to a man whose name was Joseph , of the [ y ] house of David , and the virgin ’ s name was Mary .
GNV	Luke	1	28	And the Angel went in unto her , and said , Hail thou that art [ z ] freely beloved : the Lord is with thee : [ aa ] blessed art thou among women .
GNV	Luke	1	29	And when she saw him , she was [ ab ] troubled at his saying , and thought what manner of salutation that should be .
GNV	Luke	1	30	Then the Angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast [ ac ] found favor with God .
GNV	Luke	1	31	( G ) For lo thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bear a son , ( H ) and shalt call his Name Jesus .
GNV	Luke	1	32	He shall be great , and shall be [ ad ] called the Son of the most High , and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David .
GNV	Luke	1	33	( I ) And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever , and of his kingdom shall be none end .
GNV	Luke	1	34	Then said Mary unto the Angel , [ ae ] How shall this be , seeing [ af ] I know not man ?
GNV	Luke	1	35	And the Angel answered , and said unto her , The holy Ghost [ ag ] shall come upon thee , and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee : therefore also that [ ah ] Holy thing which shall be born of thee , shall be [ ai ] called the Son of God .
GNV	Luke	1	36	And behold , thy [ aj ] cousin , Elizabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is her [ ak ] sixth month , which was called barren .
GNV	Luke	1	37	For with God shall nothing be impossible .
GNV	Luke	1	38	Then Mary said , Behold the servant of the Lord : be it unto me according to thy word . So the Angel departed from her .
GNV	Luke	1	40	And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elizabeth .
GNV	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe [ ao ] sprang in her belly , and Elizabeth was filled with the holy Ghost .
GNV	Luke	1	42	And she cried with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , because [ ap ] the fruit of thy womb is blessed .
GNV	Luke	1	43	And whence cometh this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
GNV	Luke	1	44	For lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe sprang in my belly for joy .
GNV	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she that believed : for those things shall be performed , which were told her from the Lord .
GNV	Luke	1	47	And my spirit rejoiceth in God my Savior .
GNV	Luke	1	48	For he hath [ ar ] looked on the [ as ] poor degree of his servant : for behold , from henceforth shall all ages call me blessed ,
GNV	Luke	1	49	Because he that is mighty hath done for me great things , and holy is his Name .
GNV	Luke	1	50	And his mercy is from generation to generation on them [ at ] that fear him .
GNV	Luke	1	51	( J ) He that showed strength with his [ au ] arm : ( K ) he hath [ av ] scattered the proud in the [ aw ] imagination of their hearts .
GNV	Luke	1	52	( L ) He hath [ ax ] put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of [ ay ] low degree .
GNV	Luke	1	53	( M ) He hath filled the [ az ] hungry with good things , and sent away the rich empty .
GNV	Luke	1	54	[ ba ] ( N ) He hath upholden Israel his servant to be mindful of his mercy ,
GNV	Luke	1	55	( ( O ) As he hath [ bb ] spoken to our fathers , to wit , to Abraham and his seed ) forever .
GNV	Luke	1	56	¶ And Mary abode with her about three months : after , she returned to her own house .
GNV	Luke	1	57	¶ [ bc ] Now Elizabeth ’ s time was fulfilled , that she should be delivered , and she brought forth a son .
GNV	Luke	1	58	And her neighbors and cousins heard tell how the Lord had showed his great mercy upon her , and they ( P ) rejoiced with her .
GNV	Luke	1	59	And it was so that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the babe , and called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
GNV	Luke	1	60	But his mother answered , and said , Not so , but he shall be called John .
GNV	Luke	1	61	And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is named with this name .
GNV	Luke	1	62	Then they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
GNV	Luke	1	63	So he asked for writing tablets , and wrote , saying , His name is John , and they marveled all .
GNV	Luke	1	64	And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue , [ bd ] and he spake and praised God .
GNV	Luke	1	65	Then fear came on all them that dwelt near unto them , and all [ be ] these words were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea .
GNV	Luke	1	66	And all they that heard them , [ bf ] laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner child shall this be ! and the [ bg ] hand of the Lord was with him .
GNV	Luke	1	67	[ bh ] Then his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
GNV	Luke	1	69	( R ) And hath raised up the [ bk ] horn of salvation unto us , in the house of his servant David ,
GNV	Luke	1	70	( S ) As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets , which were since the world began , saying ,
GNV	Luke	1	71	That he would send us deliverance from our enemies , and from the hands of all that hate us ,
GNV	Luke	1	72	That he might show mercy towards our fathers : and [ bl ] remember his holy covenant ,
GNV	Luke	1	73	( T ) And the oath , which he sware to our father Abraham .
GNV	Luke	1	74	Which was , that he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies , should serve him without fear ,
GNV	Luke	1	75	All the days of our life , in ( U ) holiness and righteousness [ bm ] before him .
GNV	Luke	1	77	And to [ bo ] give knowledge of salvation unto his people , by the [ bp ] remission of their sins ,
GNV	Luke	1	78	Through the tender mercy of our God , whereby ( V ) the [ bq ] dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
GNV	Luke	1	79	To give light to them that sit in darkness , and in the shadow of death , and to guide our feet into the way of [ br ] peace .
GNV	Luke	1	80	And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the wilderness , till the day came that he should show himself unto Israel .

GNV	Luke	2	36	[ y ] And there was a Prophetess , one Anna the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher , which was of a great age , after she had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity :
GNV	Luke	2	40	And the child grew , and waxed strong in Spirit , [ z ] and was filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was with him .
GNV	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass three days after , that they found him in the Temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions :
GNV	Luke	2	1	And [ a ] it came to pass in those days , that there came a decree from Augustus Caesar , that all the [ b ] world should be [ c ] taxed .
GNV	Luke	2	3	Therefore went all to be taxed , every man to his own city .
GNV	Luke	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of a city called Nazareth , into Judea , unto the [ d ] city of ( A ) David , which is called Bethlehem ( because he was of the house and lineage of David , )
GNV	Luke	2	5	To be taxed with Mary that was given him to wife , which was with child .
GNV	Luke	2	6	¶ And so it was , that while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .

GNV	Luke	2	9	And lo , the Angel of the Lord [ g ] came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone about them , and they were sore afraid .
GNV	Luke	2	10	Then the Angel said unto them , Be not afraid : for behold , I bring you glad tidings of great joy , that shall be to all the people ,
GNV	Luke	2	11	That is , that unto you is born this day in the city of David , a Savior , which is Christ the Lord .
GNV	Luke	2	12	And this shall be a sign to you , Ye shall find the babe swaddled , and laid in a cratch .
GNV	Luke	2	14	Glory be to God in the high heavens , and peace in earth , and toward men [ i ] good will .
GNV	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass when the Angels were gone away from them into heaven , that the shepherds said one to another , Let us go then unto Bethlehem , and see this thing that is come to pass , which the Lord hath showed unto us .
GNV	Luke	2	16	So they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph and the babe laid in the cratch .
GNV	Luke	2	17	And when they had seen it , they published abroad the thing that was told them of that child .
GNV	Luke	2	18	And all that heard it , wondered at the things which were told them of the shepherds .
GNV	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all those sayings , and pondered them in her heart .
GNV	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God , for all that they had heard and seen , as it was spoken unto them .
GNV	Luke	2	23	( As it is written in the Law of the Lord , ( E ) Every man child that first openeth the womb , shall be called holy to the Lord , )

GNV	Luke	2	27	And he came by the motion of the spirit into the Temple , and when the [ o ] parents brought in the babe Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the Law .
GNV	Luke	2	30	For [ r ] mine eyes have seen thy [ s ] salvation ,
GNV	Luke	2	31	Which thou hast prepared [ t ] before the face of all people ,
GNV	Luke	2	32	A light to be revealed to the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
GNV	Luke	2	33	And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things , which were spoken touching him .
GNV	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is [ u ] appointed for the ( G ) [ v ] fall and rising again of many in Israel , and for a [ w ] sign which shall be spoken against ,
GNV	Luke	2	35	( Yea and a sword shall [ x ] pierce through thy soul ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be opened .
GNV	Luke	2	37	And she was widow about fourscore , and four years , and went not out of the Temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
GNV	Luke	2	38	She then coming at the same instant upon them , confessed likewise the Lord , and spake of him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
GNV	Luke	2	39	And when they had performed all things , according to the Law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth .
GNV	Luke	2	41	¶ [ aa ] Now his parents went to Jerusalem , every year , ( H ) at the feast of the Passover .
GNV	Luke	2	42	And when he was twelve years old , and they were come up to Jerusalem , after the custom of the feast ,
GNV	Luke	2	43	And had finished the days thereof , as they returned , the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem , and Joseph knew not , nor his mother ,
GNV	Luke	2	44	But they supposing that he had been in the company , went a day ’ s journey , and sought him among their kinsfolk , and acquaintances .
GNV	Luke	2	45	And when they found him not , they turned back to Jerusalem , and sought him .
GNV	Luke	2	47	And all that heard him , were astonied at his understanding and answers .
GNV	Luke	2	48	[ ab ] So when they saw him , they were amazed , and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee with very heavy hearts .
GNV	Luke	2	49	Then said he unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? knew ye not that I must go about my Father ’ s business ?
GNV	Luke	2	50	But they understood not the word that he spake to them .
GNV	Luke	2	51	[ ac ] Then he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject to them : and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .

GNV	Luke	4	15	For he taught in their Synagogues , and was honored of all men .
GNV	Luke	4	17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet Isaiah : and when he had [ g ] opened the book , he found the place , where it was written ,
GNV	Luke	4	18	( G ) The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me , that I should preach the Gospel to the poor : he hath sent me , that I should heal the brokenhearted , that I should preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , that I should set at liberty them that are bruised :
GNV	Luke	4	19	And that I should preach the acceptable year of the Lord .
GNV	Luke	4	20	And he closed the book , and gave it again to the minister , and sat down : and the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him .
GNV	Luke	4	21	Then he began to say unto them , This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your ears .
GNV	Luke	4	22	[ h ] And all [ i ] bare him witness , and [ j ] wondered at the [ k ] gracious words , which proceeded out of his mouth , and said , Is not this Joseph ’ s son ?
GNV	Luke	4	23	Then he said unto them , Ye will surely say unto me this Proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do it here likewise in thine own country .
GNV	Luke	4	25	But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of ( I ) Elijah , when heaven was shut three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the [ l ] land :
GNV	Luke	4	26	But unto none of them was Elijah sent , save into Zarephath , a city of Sidon , unto a certain widow .
GNV	Luke	4	27	Also many lepers were in Israel , in the time of ( J ) Elisha the Prophet : yet none of them was made clean , saving Naaman the Syrian .
GNV	Luke	4	28	[ m ] Then all that were in the Synagogue , when they heard it , were filled with wrath ,
GNV	Luke	4	29	And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the edge of the hill , whereon their city was built , to cast him down headlong .
GNV	Luke	4	30	But he passed through the midst of them , and went his way ,
GNV	Luke	4	31	¶ ( K ) And came down into Capernaum a city of Galilee , and there taught them on the Sabbath days .
GNV	Luke	4	32	( L ) And they were astonied at his doctrine : for his word was with authority .
GNV	Luke	4	34	[ n ] Saying , Oh , what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know who thou art , even the Holy one of God .
GNV	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . Then the devil throwing him in the midst of them , came out of him , and hurt him nothing at all .
GNV	Luke	4	36	So fear came on them all , and they spake among themselves , saying , What thing is this : for with authority and power he commandeth the foul spirits , and they come out ?
GNV	Luke	4	37	And the fame of him spread abroad throughout all the places of the country round about .
GNV	Luke	4	39	Then he stood over her , and rebuked the fever , and it left her , and immediately she arose , and ministered unto them .
GNV	Luke	4	42	[ q ] And when it was day , he departed , and went forth into a desert place , and the people sought him , and came to him , and kept him that he should not depart from them .
GNV	Luke	4	43	But he said unto them , Surely I must also preach the kingdom of God to other cities : for therefore am I sent .
GNV	Luke	4	44	And he preached in the Synagogues of Galilee .

GNV	Luke	5	1	Then ( A ) [ a ] it came to pass , as the people [ b ] pressed upon him to hear the word of God , that he stood by the lake of Gennesaret ,
GNV	Luke	5	6	And when they had so done , they enclosed a great multitude of fishes , so that their net brake .
GNV	Luke	5	12	¶ ( B ) [ d ] Now it came to pass , as he was in a certain city , behold , there was a man full of leprosy , and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
GNV	Luke	5	16	But he kept himself apart in the wilderness , and prayed .
GNV	Luke	5	18	( D ) Then behold , men brought a man lying in a bed , which was taken with a palsy , and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
GNV	Luke	5	27	¶ ( E ) [ h ] And after that , he went forth and saw a Publican named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me .
GNV	Luke	5	34	[ j ] And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the wedding chamber to fast , as long as the bridegroom is with them ?
GNV	Luke	5	2	And saw two ships stand by the lakeside , but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
GNV	Luke	5	3	And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon ’ s , and required him that he would thrust off a little from the land : and he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
GNV	Luke	5	4	¶ Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets to make a draught .
GNV	Luke	5	7	And they beckoned to their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them , who came then , and filled both the ships , that they did sink .
GNV	Luke	5	8	Now when Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus knees , saying , Lord , go from me : for I am a sinful man .
GNV	Luke	5	9	For he was utterly astonied , and all that were with him , for the draught of fishes which they took .
GNV	Luke	5	10	And so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee , which were companions with Simon . Then Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not : from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
GNV	Luke	5	11	And when they had brought the ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
GNV	Luke	5	13	So he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will , be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
GNV	Luke	5	14	And he commanded him that he should tell it no man : but Go , saith he , and show thyself to the Priest , and offer for thy cleansing , as ( C ) Moses hath commanded , for a witness unto them .
GNV	Luke	5	15	[ e ] But so much more went there a fame abroad of him , and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed of him of their infirmities .
GNV	Luke	5	17	¶ [ f ] And it came to pass , on a certain day , as he was teaching , that the Pharisees and doctors of the Law sat by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judea , and Jerusalem , and the power of the Lord [ g ] was in him , to heal them .
GNV	Luke	5	19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in , because of the press , they went up on the house , and let him down through the tiling , bed and all , in the midst before Jesus .
GNV	Luke	5	20	And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
GNV	Luke	5	21	Then the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this that speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God only ?
GNV	Luke	5	22	But when Jesus perceived their reasoning he answered , and said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ?
GNV	Luke	5	23	Whether is easier to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee , or to say , Rise and walk ?
GNV	Luke	5	24	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority to forgive sins in earth , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy ) I say to thee , Arise : take up thy bed , and go into thine house .
GNV	Luke	5	25	And immediately he rose up before them , and took up his bed whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , praising God .
GNV	Luke	5	26	And they were all amazed , and praised God , and were filled with fear , saying , Doubtless we have seen strange things today .
GNV	Luke	5	28	And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
GNV	Luke	5	29	Then Levi made him a great feast in his own house , where there was a great company of Publicans , and of others that sat at table with them .
GNV	Luke	5	30	But they that were Scribes and Pharisees among them , murmured against his disciples , saying , Why eat ye and drink ye with Publicans and sinners ?
GNV	Luke	5	31	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , They that are whole , need not the Physician , but they that are sick .
GNV	Luke	5	32	( F ) I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
GNV	Luke	5	33	( G ) ( H ) [ i ] Then they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and pray , and the disciples of the Pharisees also , but thine eat and drink ?
GNV	Luke	5	35	But the days will come , even when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them : then shall they fast in those days .
GNV	Luke	5	36	Again he spake also unto them a parable , No man putteth a piece of a new garment into an old vesture : for then the new renteth it , and the piece taken out of the new , agreeth not with the old .
GNV	Luke	5	37	Also no man poureth new wine into old vessels : for then the new wine will break the vessels , and it will run out , and the vessels will perish :
GNV	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be poured into new vessels : so both are preserved .
GNV	Luke	5	39	Also no man that drinketh old wine , straightway desireth new : for he saith , The old is more profitable .

GNV	Luke	6	1	And ( A ) [ a ] it came to pass on a second solemn Sabbath , that he went through the corn fields , and his disciples [ b ] plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , and rubbed them in their hands .
GNV	Luke	6	13	And when it was day , ( E ) he called his disciples , and of them he chose twelve which also he called Apostles :
GNV	Luke	6	20	¶ ( F ) [ g ] And he lifted up his eyes upon his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
GNV	Luke	6	27	¶ ( L ) [ k ] But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies : do well to them which hate you .
GNV	Luke	6	46	¶ ( AA ) But why call ye me Lord , Lord , and do not the things that I speak ?
GNV	Luke	6	2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath days ?
GNV	Luke	6	3	Then Jesus answered them , and said , ( B ) Have ye not read this , that David did when he himself was an hungered , and they which were with him ,
GNV	Luke	6	4	How he went into the house of God , and took , and ate the showbread , and gave also to them which were with him , which was not lawful to eat , but for the ( C ) Priests only ?
GNV	Luke	6	5	And he said unto them , The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath day .
GNV	Luke	6	7	And the Scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the Sabbath day , that they might find an accusation against him .
GNV	Luke	6	8	But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Arise , and stand up in the midst . And he arose , and stood up .
GNV	Luke	6	9	Then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you a question , Whether is it lawful on the Sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to [ d ] destroy ?
GNV	Luke	6	10	And he beheld them all in compass , and said unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he did so , and his hand was restored again , as whole as the other .
GNV	Luke	6	11	Then they were filled full of madness , and communed one with another , what they might do to Jesus .
GNV	Luke	6	12	¶ And it came to pass in those days , that he went into a mountain to pray , and [ e ] spent the night in prayer to God .
GNV	Luke	6	14	( Simon whom he named also Peter , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
GNV	Luke	6	15	Matthew and Thomas : James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zealous ,
GNV	Luke	6	16	Judas James ’ brother , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor . )
GNV	Luke	6	17	Then he came down with them , and stood in a plain place with the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judea , and Jerusalem , and from the [ f ] sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases :
GNV	Luke	6	18	And they that were vexed with foul spirits , and they were healed .
GNV	Luke	6	19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all :
GNV	Luke	6	21	( G ) Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be satisfied : ( H ) blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
GNV	Luke	6	22	( I ) Blessed are ye when men hate you , and when [ h ] they separate you , and revile you , and put out your name as evil , for the Son of man ’ s sake .

GNV	Luke	7	1	When ( A ) [ a ] he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
GNV	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turned him , and said to the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no not in Israel .
GNV	Luke	7	11	[ b ] And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called [ c ] Nain , and many of his disciples went with him , and a great multitude .
GNV	Luke	7	19	So John called unto him two certain men of his disciples , and sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come , or shall we wait for another ?
GNV	Luke	7	33	For John Baptist came neither eating bread , nor drinking wine : and ye say , He hath the devil .
GNV	Luke	7	37	And behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee ’ s house , she brought a box of ointment .
GNV	Luke	7	2	And a certain Centurion ’ s servant was sick and ready to die , which was dear unto him .
GNV	Luke	7	3	And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the Elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come , and heal his servant .
GNV	Luke	7	4	So they came to Jesus , and besought him instantly , saying that he was worthy that he should do this for him :
GNV	Luke	7	5	For he loveth , said they , our nation , and he hath built us a Synagogue .
GNV	Luke	7	6	Then Jesus went with them : but when he was now not far from the house , the Centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
GNV	Luke	7	8	For I likewise am a man set under authority , and have under me soldiers , and I say unto one , Go , and he goeth : and to another , Come , and he cometh : and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
GNV	Luke	7	10	And when they that were sent , turned back to the house , they found the servant that was sick , whole .
GNV	Luke	7	12	Now when he came near to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , who was the only begotten son of his mother , which was a widow , and much people of the city was with her .
GNV	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
GNV	Luke	7	14	And he went and touched the coffin ( and they that bare him , stood still ) and he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
GNV	Luke	7	15	And he that was dead , sat up , and began to speak , and he delivered him to his mother .
GNV	Luke	7	16	Then there came a fear on them all , and they glorified God , saying , A great Prophet is risen among us , and God hath visited his people .
GNV	Luke	7	17	And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea , and throughout all the region round about .
GNV	Luke	7	18	[ d ] And the disciples of John showed him of all these things .
GNV	Luke	7	20	And when the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come , or shall we wait for another ?
GNV	Luke	7	21	And [ e ] at that time , he cured many of their sicknesses , and plagues , and of evil spirits , and unto many blind men he gave sight freely .
GNV	Luke	7	22	And Jesus answered , and said unto them , Go your ways and show John , what things ye have seen and heard , that the blind see , the halt go , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the poor receive the Gospel .
GNV	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he , that shall not be offended in me .
GNV	Luke	7	24	[ f ] And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people of John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
GNV	Luke	7	25	But what went ye out to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they which are gorgeously appareled , and live delicately , are in Kings ’ courts .
GNV	Luke	7	26	But what went ye forth to see ? A Prophet ? yea , I say to you , and greater than a Prophet .
GNV	Luke	7	27	This is he of whom it is written , ( B ) Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
GNV	Luke	7	28	For I say unto you , there is no greater Prophet than John , among them that are begotten of women : nevertheless , he that is the least in the kingdom of God , is greater than he .
GNV	Luke	7	29	Then all the people that heard , and the Publicans [ g ] justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
GNV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the expounders of the Law despised the counsel of God [ h ] against themselves , and were not baptized of him .
GNV	Luke	7	31	( C ) [ i ] And the Lord said , Whereunto shall I liken the men of this generation ? and what thing are they like unto ?
GNV	Luke	7	32	They are like unto little children sitting in the marketplace , and crying one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced : we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
GNV	Luke	7	34	The Son of man is come , and eateth , and drinketh : and ye say , Behold , a man which is a glutton , and a drinker of wine , a friend of Publicans and sinners :
GNV	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is justified of all her children .
GNV	Luke	7	36	¶ [ j ] And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him : and he went into the Pharisee ’ s house , and sat down at table .
GNV	Luke	7	38	( D ) And she stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
GNV	Luke	7	39	[ k ] Now when the Pharisee which bade him , saw it , he spake within himself , saying , If this man were a Prophet , he would surely have known who , and what manner of woman this is which toucheth him : [ l ] for she is a sinner .
GNV	Luke	7	40	[ m ] And Jesus answered , and said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he said , Master , say on .
GNV	Luke	7	41	There was a certain lender which had two debtors : the one ought five hundred pence , and the other fifty :
GNV	Luke	7	42	When they had nothing to pay , he forgave them both : Which of them therefore , tell me , will love him most ?
GNV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered , and said , I suppose that he to whom he forgave most . And he said unto him , Thou hast truly judged .
GNV	Luke	7	44	Then he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thine house , and thou gavest me no water to my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
GNV	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest me no kiss : but she , since the time I came in , hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
GNV	Luke	7	46	Mine head with oil thou didst not anoint : but she hath anointed my feet with ointment .
GNV	Luke	7	47	Wherefore I say unto thee , many sins are forgiven her : [ n ] for she loved much . To whom a little is forgiven , he doth love a little .
GNV	Luke	7	48	And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven thee .
GNV	Luke	7	49	And they that sat at table with him , began to say within themselves , Who is this that even forgiveth sins ?
GNV	Luke	7	50	And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee : [ o ] go in peace .

GNV	Luke	8	1	And it came to pass afterward , that he himself went through every city and town , preaching and publishing the kingdom of God , and the twelve were with him ,
GNV	Luke	8	4	( B ) [ a ] Now when much people were gathered together , and were come unto him out of all cities , he spake by a parable .
GNV	Luke	8	16	¶ ( E ) [ g ] No man when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it under a vessel , neither putteth it under the bed , but setteth it on a candlestick , that they that enter in , may see the light .
GNV	Luke	8	19	¶ ( H ) [ k ] Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come near to him for the press .
GNV	Luke	8	22	¶ ( I ) [ l ] And it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples , and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . And they launched forth .
GNV	Luke	8	26	¶ ( J ) So they sailed unto the region of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
GNV	Luke	8	37	Then the whole multitude of the country about the Gadarenes , besought him that he would depart from them : for they were taken with a great fear : and he went into the ship , and returned .
GNV	Luke	8	41	¶ ( K ) [ s ] And behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was the ruler of the Synagogue , who fell down at Jesus ’ feet , and besought him that he would come into his house .
GNV	Luke	8	43	And a woman having an issue of blood , twelve years long , which had spent all her [ t ] substance upon physicians , and could not be healed of any :
GNV	Luke	8	52	And all wept , and [ u ] sorrowed for her : but he said , Weep not : for she is not dead , but sleepeth .
GNV	Luke	8	2	And certain women , which were healed of evil spirits , and infirmities , as ( A ) Mary which was called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
GNV	Luke	8	3	And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod ’ s steward , and Susanna , and many others which ministered unto him of their substance .
GNV	Luke	8	5	, chap .
GNV	Luke	8	6	And some fell on the stones , and when it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moistness .
GNV	Luke	8	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
GNV	Luke	8	9	Then his disciples asked him , demanding what parable that was .
GNV	Luke	8	10	And he said , Unto you it is given to know the [ b ] secrets of the kingdom of God , but to others in parables , that when ( C ) they see , they should not see , and when they hear , they should not understand .
GNV	Luke	8	11	( D ) The parable is this , The seed is the word of God .
GNV	Luke	8	12	And they that are beside the way , are they that hear : afterward cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe , and be saved .
GNV	Luke	8	13	But they that are on the stones , are they which when they have heard , receive the word with joy : but they have no roots : which for a while believe , but in the time of temptation go away .
GNV	Luke	8	14	And that which fell among thorns , are they which have heard , and after [ c ] their departure are choked with cares and with riches , and voluptuous living , and [ d ] bring forth no fruit .
GNV	Luke	8	15	But that which fell in good ground , are they which with an [ e ] honest and good heart hear the word , [ f ] and keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
GNV	Luke	8	17	( F ) For nothing is secret , that shall not be evident : neither anything hid , that shall not be known , and come to light .

GNV	Luke	8	20	And it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , and would see thee .
GNV	Luke	8	21	But he answered , and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
GNV	Luke	8	23	And as they sailed , he fell [ m ] asleep , and there came down a storm of wind on the lake , and [ n ] they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
GNV	Luke	8	24	Then they went to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , Master , we perish . And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and the waves of water : and they ceased , and it was calm .
GNV	Luke	8	25	Then he said unto them , Where is your faith ? and they feared , and wondered among themselves , saying , Who is this that commandeth both the winds and water , and they obey him !
GNV	Luke	8	27	[ o ] And as he went out to land , there met him a certain man out of the city , which had devils long time , and he wore no garment , neither abode in house , but in the graves .
GNV	Luke	8	28	And when he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus the son of God the most High ? I beseech thee torment me not .
GNV	Luke	8	29	For he commanded the foul spirit to come out of the man : ( for oft times he had caught him : therefore he was bound with chains , and kept in fetters : but he brake the bands , [ p ] and was carried of the devil into wildernesses . )
GNV	Luke	8	30	Then Jesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? and he said , Legion , because many devils were entered into him .
GNV	Luke	8	31	And they besought him , that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
GNV	Luke	8	32	And there was thereby an herd of many swine feeding on an hill : and the devils besought him , that he would suffer them to enter into them . So he suffered them .
GNV	Luke	8	33	Then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd was carried with violence from a steep down place into the lake , and was choked .
GNV	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what was done , they fled : and when they were departed , they told it in the city and in the country .
GNV	Luke	8	35	Then they came out to see what was done , and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
GNV	Luke	8	36	They also which saw it , told them by what means he that was possessed with the devil , was healed .
GNV	Luke	8	38	Then the man , out of whom the devils were departed , besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
GNV	Luke	8	39	Return into thine own house , and show what great things God hath done to thee . So he went his way , and preached [ q ] throughout all the city , what great things Jesus had done unto him .
GNV	Luke	8	40	¶ And it came to pass , when Jesus was come again , that the people [ r ] received him : for they all waited for him .
GNV	Luke	8	42	For he had but a daughter only , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying ( and as he went , the people thronged him .
GNV	Luke	8	44	When she came behind him , she touched the hem of his garment , and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
GNV	Luke	8	45	Then Jesus said , Who is it that hath touched me ? When every man denied , Peter said and they that were with him , Master , the multitude thrust thee , and tread on thee , and sayest thou , Who hath touched me ?
GNV	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said , Someone hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
GNV	Luke	8	47	When the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and fell down before him , and told him before all the people : for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
GNV	Luke	8	48	And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath saved thee : go in peace . )
GNV	Luke	8	49	While he yet spake , there came one from the ruler of the Synagogue ’ s house , which said to him , Thy daughter is dead : disease not the Master .
GNV	Luke	8	50	When Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be saved .
GNV	Luke	8	51	And when he went into the house , he suffered no man to go in with him , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and mother of the maid .
GNV	Luke	8	53	And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
GNV	Luke	8	54	So he thrust them all out , and took her by the hand , and cried , saying , Maid , arise .
GNV	Luke	8	55	And her spirit came again , and she [ v ] rose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
GNV	Luke	8	56	Then her parents were astonied : but he commanded them that they should tell no man what was done . Footnotes - Luke 8:4 The selfsame Gospel is sown everywhere , but not with like fruit , and that through the only fault of men themselves . - Luke 8:10 Those things are called secret , which may not be uttered : for the word used here , is as much as we say in our tongue , to hold a man ’ s peace . - Luke 8:14 That is , so soon as they have heard the word , they go about their business . - Luke 8:14 They bring not forth perfect and full fruit to the ripening : or , they begin , but they bring not to an end . - Luke 8:15 Which seeketh not only to seem such a one , but is so indeed : so that this word , Honest , respecteth the outward life , and the word , good , is referred to the good gifts of the mind . - Luke 8:15 With much ado : for the devil and the flesh fight against the spirit of God , which is a new guest . - Luke 8:16 That that every man hath received in private , he ought to bestow to the use and profit of all men . - Luke 8:18 Heavenly gifts are lost with niggardliness , and increase with liberality . - Luke 8:18 That is , with what minds you come to hear the word , and how you behave yourselves when you have heard it . - Luke 8:18 Either to himself , or to others , or to both : for there are none so proud , as these fellows , if it were possible to see that , that they cloke : neither are there that deceive the simple more than they do . - Luke 8:19 There is no knot of flesh and blood , among men so nigh and strait , as the band which is between Christ , and them who embrace him with a true faith . - Luke 8:22 It is expedient for us sometimes to come into extreme danger , as though Christ passed not for us , that we may have a better trial , both of his power , and also of our weakness . - Luke 8:23 Jesus fell on sleep : and it appeareth , that he was very fast on sleep , because they called twice before he awoke . - Luke 8:23 Not the disciples , but the ship . - Luke 8:27 Christ showeth , by casting out a Legion of devils by his word only , that his heavenly virtue was appointed to deliver men from the slavery of the devil : but foolish men will not for the most part redeem this so excellent grace freely offered unto them , with the least loss of their pelting pelf . - Luke 8:29 By force and violence , as a horse when he is spurred . - Luke 8:39 To wit , the city of the Gadarenes : and though Mark says that he preached it in Decapolis , they differ not , for Pliny recordeth , lib .

GNV	Luke	9	1	Then ( A ) [ a ] called he his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to heal diseases .
GNV	Luke	9	7	¶ ( E ) [ c ] Now Herod the Tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he [ d ] doubted , because that it was said of some , that John was risen again from the dead :
GNV	Luke	9	19	They answered , and said , John Baptist : and others say , Elijah : and some say , that one of the old Prophets is risen again .
GNV	Luke	9	12	( H ) And when the day began to wear away , the twelve came , and said unto him , Send the people away , that they may go into the towns and villages round about , and lodge , and get meat : for we are here in a desert place .
GNV	Luke	9	20	And he said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answered , and said : That Christ of God .
GNV	Luke	9	24	( L ) For whosoever will save his life , shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
GNV	Luke	9	35	( Q ) And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is that my beloved Son , hear him .
GNV	Luke	9	39	And lo , a spirit taketh him , and suddenly he crieth , and he teareth him , that he foameth , and hardly departeth from him , when he hath [ q ] bruised him .
GNV	Luke	9	46	¶ ( T ) [ t ] Then there arose a disputation among them , which of them should be the greatest .
GNV	Luke	9	49	¶ ( U ) [ u ] And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy Name , and we forbad him , because he followeth thee not with us .
GNV	Luke	9	52	And sent messengers before him : and they went and entered into a town of the Samaritans , to prepare him lodging .
GNV	Luke	9	55	But Jesus turned about , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not of what [ y ] spirit ye are .
GNV	Luke	9	57	¶ [ z ] And it came to pass that as they went in the way , ( W ) a certain man said unto him , I will follow thee , Lord , whithersoever thou goest .
GNV	Luke	9	59	[ aa ] But he said unto another , Follow me . And the same said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
GNV	Luke	9	61	[ ac ] Then another said , I will follow thee , Lord : but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at mine house .
GNV	Luke	9	2	( B ) And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God , and to cure the sick .
GNV	Luke	9	3	And he said to them , ( C ) Take nothing to your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , nor silver , neither have two coats apiece .
GNV	Luke	9	4	And whatsoever house ye enter into , there [ b ] abide , and thence depart .
GNV	Luke	9	5	And how many soever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , ( D ) shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
GNV	Luke	9	6	And they went out , and went through every town preaching the Gospel , and healing everywhere .
GNV	Luke	9	8	And of some , that Elijah had appeared : and of some , that one of the old Prophets was risen again .
GNV	Luke	9	10	¶ ( F ) [ e ] And when the Apostles returned , they told him what great things they had done . ( G ) Then he took them to him , and went aside into a [ f ] solitary place , near to the city called Bethsaida .
GNV	Luke	9	11	But when the people knew it , they followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need to be healed .
GNV	Luke	9	13	But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes , [ g ] except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
GNV	Luke	9	14	For they were about five thousand men . Then he said to his disciples , Cause them to sit down by fifties in a company .
GNV	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and caused all to sit down .
GNV	Luke	9	16	Then he took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looked up to heaven , and [ h ] blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples , to set before the people .
GNV	Luke	9	17	So they did all eat , and were satisfied : and there was taken up of that remained to them , twelve baskets full of broken meat .
GNV	Luke	9	18	¶ ( I ) [ i ] And it came to pass , as he was [ j ] alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
GNV	Luke	9	21	And he warned and commanded them , that they should tell that to no man ,
GNV	Luke	9	22	[ k ] Saying , ( J ) The Son of man must suffer many things , and be reproved of the Elders , and of the high Priests and Scribes , and be slain , and the third day rise again .
GNV	Luke	9	23	¶ ( K ) And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross [ l ] daily , and follow me .
GNV	Luke	9	25	( M ) For what advantageth it a man , if he win the whole world , and destroy himself , or lose himself ?
GNV	Luke	9	26	( N ) For whosoever shall be ashamed of me , and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his glory , and in the glory of the Father , and of the holy Angels .
GNV	Luke	9	27	( O ) And I tell you of a surety , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God .
GNV	Luke	9	28	( P ) [ m ] And it came to pass about an eight days after those words , that he took Peter and John , and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
GNV	Luke	9	29	And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was changed , and his garment was white and glistered .
GNV	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men talked with him , which were Moses and Elijah :
GNV	Luke	9	31	Which appeared in glory , and told of his [ n ] departing , which he should accomplish at Jerusalem .
GNV	Luke	9	32	But Peter and they that were with him , were heavy with sleep , and when they awoke , they saw his glory , and the two men standing with him .
GNV	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : let us therefore make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah , and wist not what he said .
GNV	Luke	9	34	While he thus spake , there came a cloud and overshadowed them , and they feared when they were entering into the cloud .
GNV	Luke	9	36	And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone : and they kept it close , and told no man in [ o ] those days any of those things which they had seen .
GNV	Luke	9	37	¶ [ p ] And it came to pass on the next day , as they came down from the mountain , much people met him .
GNV	Luke	9	38	( R ) And behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , behold my son : for he is all that I have .
GNV	Luke	9	40	Now I have besought thy disciples to cast him out , but they could not .
GNV	Luke	9	41	Then Jesus answered and said , O generation faithless , and crooked , how long now shall I be with you , and suffer you ? bring thy son hither .
GNV	Luke	9	42	And while he was yet coming , the devil rent him , and tore him : and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him to his father .
GNV	Luke	9	43	¶ [ r ] And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God : and while they all wondered at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
GNV	Luke	9	44	[ s ] Mark these words diligently : ( S ) for it shall come to pass , that the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
GNV	Luke	9	45	But they understood not that word : for it was hid from them , so that they could not perceive it : and they feared to ask him of that word .
GNV	Luke	9	47	When Jesus saw the thoughts of their hearts , he took a little child , and set him by him ,
GNV	Luke	9	48	And said unto them , Whosoever receiveth this little child in my Name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , he shall be great .
GNV	Luke	9	50	Then Jesus said unto him , Forbid ye him not : for he that is not against us , is with us .
GNV	Luke	9	51	¶ [ v ] And it came to pass , when the days were accomplished , that he should be received up , he [ w ] settled himself fully to go to Jerusalem ,
GNV	Luke	9	53	But they would not receive him , because his behavior was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
GNV	Luke	9	54	[ x ] And when his disciples , James and John saw it , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command , that fire come down from heaven , and consume them , even as ( V ) Elijah did ?
GNV	Luke	9	56	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men ’ s lives , but to save them . Then they went to another town .
GNV	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven nests , but the Son of man hath not whereon to lay his head .

GNV	Luke	10	19	Behold , I give unto you power to tread on Serpents , and Scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall [ k ] hurt you .
GNV	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subdued unto you : but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
GNV	Luke	10	21	¶ [ l ] That same hour rejoiced Jesus in the spirit , and said , I confess unto thee , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the [ m ] wise and understanding , and hast revealed them to babes : even so , Father , because it so pleased thee . [ n ]

GNV	Luke	11	14	¶ ( E ) Then he cast out a devil which was dumb : and when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake , and the people wondered .
GNV	Luke	11	27	¶ [ l ] And it came to pass as he said these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
GNV	Luke	11	29	¶ ( J ) [ m ] And when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is a wicked generation : they seek a sign , and there shall no sign be given them , but the sign of ( K ) Jonah the Prophet .
GNV	Luke	11	37	¶ [ o ] And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down at the table .
GNV	Luke	11	2	( A ) And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , [ a ] Our Father which art in heaven , hallowed be thy Name . Thy kingdom come : Let thy will be done , even in earth , as it is in heaven :
GNV	Luke	11	3	Our daily bread give us [ b ] for the day :
GNV	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins : for even we forgive every man that is indebted to us : And lead us not into temptation : but deliver us from evil .
GNV	Luke	11	5	¶ [ c ] Moreover he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go to him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ?
GNV	Luke	11	6	For a friend of mine is come out of the way to me , and I have nothing to set before him :
GNV	Luke	11	7	And he within should answer , and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed : I can not rise and give them to thee .
GNV	Luke	11	8	I say unto you , Though he would not arise and give him , because he is his friend , yet doubtless because of his [ d ] importunity , he would rise and give him as many as he needed .
GNV	Luke	11	9	( B ) And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you : seek , and ye shall find : knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
GNV	Luke	11	10	( C ) For everyone that asketh , receiveth : and he that seeketh , findeth : and to him that knocketh , it shall be opened .
GNV	Luke	11	12	Or if he ask an egg , will he give him a scorpion ?
GNV	Luke	11	13	If ye then which are evil , can give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your heavenly Father give the holy Ghost to them that desire him ?

GNV	Luke	11	16	And others tempted him , seeking of him a sign from heaven .
GNV	Luke	11	17	[ f ] But he knew their thoughts , and said unto them , ( G ) Every kingdom divided against itself , shall be desolate , and an house divided against an house , falleth .
GNV	Luke	11	18	So if Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand , because ye say that I cast out devils [ g ] through Beelzebub ?
GNV	Luke	11	19	If I through Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? Therefore shall they be your judges .
GNV	Luke	11	20	But if I by the [ h ] finger of God cast out devils , doubtless the kingdom of God is come unto you .

GNV	Luke	11	26	Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits worse than himself : and they enter in , and dwell there : ( I ) so the last state of that man is worse than the first .
GNV	Luke	11	28	But he said , Yea , rather blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it .
GNV	Luke	11	30	For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites : so shall also the son of man be to this generation .
GNV	Luke	11	31	( L ) The Queen of the South shall rise in judgment , with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
GNV	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they ( M ) repented at the preaching of Jonah : and behold , a greater than Jonah is here .
GNV	Luke	11	33	¶ ( N ) [ n ] No man when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a privy place , neither under a bushel : but on a candlestick , that they which come in , may see the light .
GNV	Luke	11	34	( O ) The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , then is thy whole body light : but if thine eye be evil , then thy body is dark .
GNV	Luke	11	35	Take heed therefore , that the light which is in thee , be not darkness .
GNV	Luke	11	36	If therefore thy whole body shall be light , having no part dark , then shall all be light , even as when a candle doth light thee with the brightness .
GNV	Luke	11	38	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner .
GNV	Luke	11	39	( P ) And the Lord said to him , Indeed ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup , and of the platter : but the inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
GNV	Luke	11	40	Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without , make that which is within also ?
GNV	Luke	11	41	Therefore , give alms [ p ] of those things which you have , and behold , all things shall be clean unto you .
GNV	Luke	11	42	[ q ] But woe be to you , Pharisees : for ye [ r ] tithe the mint and the rue , and [ s ] all manner herbs , and pass over [ t ] judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to have left the other undone .
GNV	Luke	11	43	( Q ) [ u ] Woe be to you , Pharisees : for ye love the uppermost seats in the Synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
GNV	Luke	11	44	[ v ] Woe be to you , Scribes and Pharisees hypocrites : ( R ) for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them , perceive not .
GNV	Luke	11	45	¶ [ w ] Then answered one of the Lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou puttest us to rebuke also .
GNV	Luke	11	46	And he said , Woe be to you also , ye Lawyers : ( S ) for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
GNV	Luke	11	47	[ x ] Woe be to you : ( T ) for ye build the sepulchers of the Prophets , and your fathers killed them .
GNV	Luke	11	48	Truly [ y ] ye bear witness , and allow the deeds of your fathers : for they killed them , and ye build their sepulchers .
GNV	Luke	11	49	Therefore said the wisdom of God , I will send them Prophets and Apostles , and of them they shall slay , and [ z ] persecute away ,
GNV	Luke	11	50	That the blood of all the Prophets , [ aa ] shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ,
GNV	Luke	11	51	From the blood of ( U ) Abel unto the blood of ( V ) Zechariah , which was slain between the altar and the Temple : verily I say unto you , it shall be required of this generation .
GNV	Luke	11	52	[ ab ] Woe be to you , Lawyers : for ye have [ ac ] taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that came in , ye forbade .
GNV	Luke	11	53	[ ad ] And as he said these things unto them , the Scribes and Pharisees began to urge him sore , and to [ ae ] provoke him to speak of many things ,
GNV	Luke	11	54	Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something of his mouth , whereby they might accuse him .

GNV	Luke	12	1	In ( A ) [ a ] the meantime , there gathered together [ b ] an innumerable multitude of people , so that they trod one another : and he began to say unto his disciples first , Take heed to yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
GNV	Luke	12	5	But I will [ d ] forewarn you , whom ye shall fear : fear him which after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell : yea , I say unto you , him fear .
GNV	Luke	12	8	( E ) [ e ] Also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man confess also before the Angels of God .
GNV	Luke	12	16	[ j ] And he put forth a parable unto them , saying , The [ k ] ground of a certain rich man brought forth fruits plenteously .
GNV	Luke	12	21	So is he that gathereth riches [ n ] to himself , and is not rich in God .
GNV	Luke	12	31	[ q ] But rather seek ye after the kingdom of God , and all these things shall be cast upon you .
GNV	Luke	12	39	( K ) Now understand this , that if the good man of the house had known at what hour the thief would have come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be dug through .
GNV	Luke	12	51	( L ) Think ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , nay , but rather debate .
GNV	Luke	12	2	( B ) For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed : neither hid , that shall not be known .
GNV	Luke	12	3	Wherefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness , it shall be heard in the light : and that which ye have spoken in the ear , in secret places , shall be preached on the houses .
GNV	Luke	12	4	( C ) [ c ] And I say unto you , my friends , be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that are not able to do anymore .
GNV	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows bought for two farthings , and yet not one of them is forgotten before God ?

GNV	Luke	12	11	( G ) [ f ] And when they shall bring you unto the Synagogues , and unto the rulers and Princes , take no thought how , or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall speak .
GNV	Luke	12	13	[ g ] And one of the company said unto him , Master , bid my brother divide the inheritance with me .
GNV	Luke	12	14	And he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge , or a divider over you ?
GNV	Luke	12	15	Wherefore he said unto them , Take heed , and beware of [ h ] covetousness : for though a man have abundance , yet his [ i ] life standeth not in his riches .
GNV	Luke	12	17	Therefore he [ l ] thought with himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where I may lay up my fruits ?
GNV	Luke	12	18	And he said , This will I do , I will pull down my barns , and build greater , and therein will I gather all my fruits , and my goods .
GNV	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years , live at ease , eat , drink , and [ m ] take thy pastime .
GNV	Luke	12	20	But God said unto him , O fool , this night will they fetch away thy soul from thee : then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided ?
GNV	Luke	12	22	[ o ] And he spake unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , ( H ) Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat : neither for your body , what ye shall put on .
GNV	Luke	12	23	The life is more than meat : and the body more than the raiment .
GNV	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap : which neither have storehouse nor barn , and yet God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than fowls ?
GNV	Luke	12	25	And which of you with taking thought , can add to his stature one cubit ?
GNV	Luke	12	26	If ye then be not able to do the least thing , why take ye thought for the remnant ?
GNV	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies how they grow : they labor not , neither spin they : yet I say unto you , that Solomon himself in all his royalty was not clothed like one of these .
GNV	Luke	12	28	If then God so clothe the grass which is today in the field , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
GNV	Luke	12	29	Therefore ask not what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither [ p ] hang you in suspense .
GNV	Luke	12	30	For all such things the people of the world seek for : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
GNV	Luke	12	32	[ r ] Fear not , little flock : for it is your Father ’ s pleasure to give you the kingdom .
GNV	Luke	12	33	¶ ( I ) [ s ] Sell that ye have , and give [ t ] alms : make you bags which wax not old : a treasure that can never fail in heaven , where no thief cometh neither moth corrupteth .
GNV	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your hearts be also .
GNV	Luke	12	35	¶ ( J ) [ u ] Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ,
GNV	Luke	12	36	And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their master , when he will return from the wedding , that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
GNV	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants , whom the Lord when he cometh shall find waking : verily I say unto you , he will gird himself about , and make them to sit down at table , and will come forth , and serve them .
GNV	Luke	12	38	And if he come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and shall find them so , blessed are those servants .
GNV	Luke	12	40	[ v ] Be ye also prepared therefore : for the Son of man will come at an hour when ye think not .
GNV	Luke	12	41	Then Peter said unto him , Master , tellest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
GNV	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , Who is a faithful steward and wise , whom the master shall make ruler over his household , to give them their [ w ] portion of meat in season ?
GNV	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant , whom his master when he cometh , shall find so doing .
GNV	Luke	12	44	Of a truth , I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
GNV	Luke	12	45	But if that servant say in his heart , My master doth defer his coming , and shall begin to smite the servants , and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ,
GNV	Luke	12	46	The master of that servant will come in a day when he thinketh not , and at an hour when he is not aware of , and will cut him off , and give him his portion with the unbelievers .
GNV	Luke	12	47	¶ And that servant that knew his master ’ s will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
GNV	Luke	12	48	But he that knew it not , and yet did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes : for unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required , and to whom men much commit , [ x ] the more of him will they ask .
GNV	Luke	12	49	¶ [ y ] I am come to put fire on the earth , and what is my desire , if it be already kindled ?
GNV	Luke	12	50	Notwithstanding I must be baptized with a baptism , and how am I grieved till it be ended ?
GNV	Luke	12	52	For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
GNV	Luke	12	53	The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father : the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother : the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law , and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .
GNV	Luke	12	54	¶ ( M ) [ z ] Then said he to the people , When ye see a cloud [ aa ] rise out of the West , straightway ye say , A shower cometh : and so it is .
GNV	Luke	12	55	And when ye see the South wind blow , ye say , that it will be hot : and it cometh to pass .
GNV	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the earth , and of the sky : but why discern ye not this time ?
GNV	Luke	12	57	[ ab ] Yea , and why judge ye not of yourselves what is right ?
GNV	Luke	12	58	¶ ( N ) While thou goest with thine adversary to the ruler , as thou art in the way , give diligence in the way , that thou mayest be delivered from him , lest he draw thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the [ ac ] jailer , and the jailer cast thee into prison .

GNV	Luke	13	4	Or think you that those eighteen , upon whom the tower in [ c ] Siloam fell , and slew them , were sinners above all men that dwell in Jerusalem ?
GNV	Luke	13	6	¶ [ d ] He spake also this parable , A certain man had a fig tree , planted in his vineyard : and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
GNV	Luke	13	11	And behold , there was a woman which had a [ g ] spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could not lift up herself in any wise .
GNV	Luke	13	19	[ k ] It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his garden , and it grew , and waxed a great tree , and the fowls of the heaven made nests in the branches thereof .
GNV	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three pecks of flour , till all was leavened .
GNV	Luke	13	23	Then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that shall be saved ? And he said unto them ,
GNV	Luke	13	31	[ p ] The same day there came certain Pharisees , and said unto him , Depart , and go hence : for Herod will kill thee .
GNV	Luke	13	1	There [ a ] were certain men present at the same season , that showed him of the Galileans , whose blood [ b ] Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
GNV	Luke	13	2	And Jesus answered , and said unto them , Suppose ye , that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans , because they have suffered such things ?
GNV	Luke	13	3	I tell you , nay : but except ye amend your lives , ye shall all likewise perish .
GNV	Luke	13	5	I tell you , nay : but except ye amend your lives , ye shall all likewise perish .
GNV	Luke	13	7	Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , this three years have I come and sought fruit of this fig tree , and find none : cut it down : why keepeth it also the ground [ e ] barren ?
GNV	Luke	13	8	And he answered , and said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I dig round about it , and dung it .
GNV	Luke	13	9	And if it bear fruit , well : if not , then after thou shalt cut it down .
GNV	Luke	13	10	¶ [ f ] And he taught in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath day .
GNV	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said to her , Woman , thou art [ h ] loosed from thy disease .
GNV	Luke	13	14	[ i ] And the [ j ] ruler of the Synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus healed on the Sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day .
GNV	Luke	13	15	Then answered him the Lord , and said , Hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the Sabbath day loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to the water ?
GNV	Luke	13	16	And ought not this daughter of Abraham , whom Satan had bound , lo , eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ?

GNV	Luke	14	1	And [ a ] it came to pass that when he was entered into the house of [ b ] one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath day , to eat bread , they watched him .
GNV	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was a certain man before him , which had the dropsy .
GNV	Luke	14	3	Then Jesus answering , spake unto the Lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ?
GNV	Luke	14	4	And they held their peace . Then he took him , and healed him , and let him go ,
GNV	Luke	14	5	And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass , or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day ?
GNV	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer him again to those things .
GNV	Luke	14	7	¶ [ c ] He spake also a parable to the guests , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms , and said unto them ,

GNV	Luke	14	18	[ e ] But they all with [ f ] one mind began to make excuse : The first said unto him , I have bought a farm , and I must needs go out and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
GNV	Luke	14	19	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
GNV	Luke	14	20	And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come .
GNV	Luke	14	21	So that servant returned , and showed his master these things . Then was the good man of the house angry , and said to his servant , Go out quickly into the [ g ] streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
GNV	Luke	14	22	And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
GNV	Luke	14	24	For I say unto you , that none of those men which were bidden , shall taste of my supper .
GNV	Luke	14	25	[ h ] Now there went great multitudes with him , and he turned and said unto them ,

GNV	Luke	15	16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate : but no man gave them him .
GNV	Luke	15	17	[ e ] Then he came to himself , and said , How many hired servants at my father ’ s have bread enough , and I die for hunger ?
GNV	Luke	15	18	I will rise and go to my father , and say unto him , Father , I have sinned against [ f ] heaven , and before thee ,
GNV	Luke	15	19	And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thine hired servants .
GNV	Luke	15	20	So he arose and came to his father , and when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
GNV	Luke	15	21	[ g ] And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
GNV	Luke	15	22	Then the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet ,
GNV	Luke	15	23	And bring the fat calf , and kill him , and let us eat , and be merry :
GNV	Luke	15	24	For this my son was dead , and is alive again : and he was lost , but he is found . And they began to be merry .
GNV	Luke	15	25	[ h ] Now the elder brother was in the field , and when he came and drew near to the house , he heard melody , and dancing ,
GNV	Luke	15	26	And called one of his servants , and asked what those things meant .
GNV	Luke	15	27	And he said unto him , Thy brother is come , and thy father hath killed the fat calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
GNV	Luke	15	28	Then he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and entreated him .
GNV	Luke	15	29	But he answered , and said to his father , Lo , these many years have I done thee service , neither brake I at anytime thy commandment , and yet thou never gavest me a kid that I might make merry with my friends .
GNV	Luke	15	30	But when this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy goods with harlots , thou hast for his sake killed the fat calf .
GNV	Luke	15	31	And he said unto him , Son thou art ever with me , and all that I have , is thine . It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again : and he was lost , but he is found .

GNV	Luke	16	1	And he said also unto his disciples , [ a ] There was a certain rich man , which had a steward , and he was accused unto him , that he wasted his goods .
GNV	Luke	16	13	( A ) [ i ] No servant can serve two masters : for either he shall hate the one , and love the other : or else he shall lean to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and riches .
GNV	Luke	16	19	¶ [ m ] There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in [ n ] purple and fine linen , and fared well and delicately every day .
GNV	Luke	16	2	And he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? Give an account of thy stewardship : for thou mayest be no longer steward .
GNV	Luke	16	3	Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my master taketh away from me the stewardship . I can not dig , and to beg I am ashamed .
GNV	Luke	16	4	I know what I will do , that when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
GNV	Luke	16	5	Then called he unto him everyone of his master ’ s debtors , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my master ?
GNV	Luke	16	6	And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said to him , Take thy writing , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
GNV	Luke	16	7	Then said he to another , How much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . Then he said to him , Take thy writing and write fourscore .
GNV	Luke	16	8	And the Lord commended [ b ] the unjust steward , because he had done wisely . Wherefore the [ c ] children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
GNV	Luke	16	9	And I say unto you , Make you friends with the riches [ d ] of iniquity , that when ye shall want , they may receive you into everlasting [ e ] habitations .
GNV	Luke	16	10	[ f ] He that is faithful in the least , he is also faithful in much : and he that is unjust in the least , is unjust also in much .
GNV	Luke	16	11	If then ye have not been faithful in the wicked riches , who will trust you in the [ g ] true treasure ?
GNV	Luke	16	12	And if ye have not been faithful in [ h ] another man ’ s goods , who shall give you that which is yours ?
GNV	Luke	16	14	All these things heard the Pharisees also which were covetous , and they scoffed at him .
GNV	Luke	16	15	[ j ] Then he said unto them , Ye are they , which justify yourselves before men : but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men , is abomination in the sight of God .
GNV	Luke	16	17	( C ) Now it is more easy that heaven and earth should pass away , than that one tittle of the Law should fall .
GNV	Luke	16	18	¶ ( D ) Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , commiteth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her [ l ] that is put away from her husband , commiteth adultery .
GNV	Luke	16	20	Also there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate full of sores ,
GNV	Luke	16	21	And desired to be refreshed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man ’ s table : yea , and the dogs came and licked his sores .
GNV	Luke	16	22	And it was so that the beggar died , and was carried by the Angels into Abraham ’ s bosom . The rich man also died , and was buried .
GNV	Luke	16	23	And being in hell in torments , [ o ] he lifted up his eyes , and saw Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
GNV	Luke	16	24	Then he cried , and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue : for I am tormented in this flame .
GNV	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy pleasures , and likewise Lazarus pains : now therefore is he comforted , and thou art tormented .
GNV	Luke	16	26	Besides all this , between you and us there is a great gulf set , so that they which would go from hence to you , can not : neither can they come from thence to us .
GNV	Luke	16	27	[ p ] Then he said , I pray thee therefore father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ’ s house ,
GNV	Luke	16	28	( For I have five brethren ) that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
GNV	Luke	16	29	Abraham said unto him , They have Moses and the Prophets : let them hear them .
GNV	Luke	16	30	And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one came unto them from the dead , they will amend their lives .
GNV	Luke	16	31	Then he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the Prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rise from the dead again . Footnotes - Luke 16:1 Seeing that men oftentimes purchase friendship to themselves , by other men ’ s costs , it is a shame for us , if with a free and liberal bestowing of the goods which the Lord hath given us to that purpose , we do not please him , nor procure the good will of our neighbors , seeing that by this only means , riches , which are oftentimes occasions of sin , are turned to another end and purpose . - Luke 16:8 This parable doth not approve the steward ’ s naughty dealing , for it was every theft : but parables are set forth , to show a thing covertly , and as it were under a figure to represent the truth , though it agree not thoroughly with the matter itself : so that Christ meaneth by this parable to teach us , that worldly men are more heady in the affairs of this world , than the children of God are careful for everlasting life . - Luke 16:8 Men that are given to this present life , contrary to whom the children of light are set : St. Paul calls those spiritual , and the other carnal . - Luke 16:9 This is not spoken of goods that are evil gotten , for God will have our bountifulness to the poor , proceed and come from a good fountain : but he calleth those riches of iniquity , which men use naughtily . - Luke 16:9 To wit , the poor Christians : for they are the inheritors of these Tabernacles , Theophylact . - Luke 16:10 We ought to take heed that for abusing our earthly function and duty , we be not deprived of heavenly gifts : for how can they use spiritual gifts aright , who abuse worldly things ? - Luke 16:11 That is , heavenly and true riches : which are contrary to worldly and flitting substance . - Luke 16:12 In worldly goods , which are called other men ’ s , because they are committed to our credit . - Luke 16:13 No man can love God and riches together . - Luke 16:15 Our sins are not hidden to God , although they be hidden to men , yea although they be hidden to them whose sins they are . - Luke 16:16 The Pharisees despised the excellency of the new Covenant , in respect of the old , being ignorant of the perfect righteousness of the Law , and how false expounders they were of the Law , Christ declareth by the seventh Commandment . - Luke 16:18 They that gather by this place , that a man can not be married again after that he hath put away his wife for adultery , while she liveth , reason fondly : for Christ speaketh of those divorces which the Jews used , of which sort we can not take the divorcement for adultery , for adulterers were put to death by the law . - Luke 16:19 The end of the poverty and misery of the godly , shall be everlasting joy : as the end of riotousness and cruel pride of the rich shall be everlasting misery , without all hope of mercy . - Luke 16:19 Very gorgeously and sumptuously , for purple garments were costly , and this fine linen which was a kind of linen that came out of Achaia , was as dear as gold . - Luke 16:23 Heavenly and spiritual things are expressed , and set forth under colors and resemblances fit for our senses . - Luke 16:27 Seeing that we have a most sure rule to live by , laid forth unto us in the word of God , rashly and vainly do men seek for other revelation .

GNV	Luke	17	1	Then said he to his disciples , ( A ) [ a ] It can not be avoided , but that offences will come , but woe be to him by whom they come .
GNV	Luke	17	3	¶ [ b ] Take heed to yourselves : if thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him : and if he repent , forgive him .
GNV	Luke	17	10	[ f ] So likewise ye , when ye have done all those things , which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
GNV	Luke	17	11	¶ [ g ] And so it was when he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria , and Galilee .
GNV	Luke	17	20	¶ [ h ] And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them , and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with [ i ] observation .
GNV	Luke	17	33	( I ) Whosoever will seek to save his soul , shall loose it : and whosoever shall loose it , shall [ p ] get it life .
GNV	Luke	17	36	Two shall be in the field : one shall be received , and another shall be left .
GNV	Luke	17	2	It is better for him that a great millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were cast into the sea , then that he should offend one of these little ones .
GNV	Luke	17	4	( B ) And though he sin against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , it repenteth me , thou shalt forgive him .
GNV	Luke	17	5	¶ [ c ] And the Apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
GNV	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said , ( C ) If ye had faith , as much as is [ d ] a grain of mustard seed , and should say unto this mulberry tree , Pluck thyself up by the roots , and plant thyself in the sea , it should even obey you .
GNV	Luke	17	7	¶ [ e ] Who is it also of you , that having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , would say unto him by and by , when he were come from the field , Go , and sit down at table ,
GNV	Luke	17	8	And would not rather say to him , Dress wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken , and afterward eat thou , and drink thou ?
GNV	Luke	17	9	Doth he thank that servant , because he did that which was commanded unto him ? I trow not .
GNV	Luke	17	12	And as he entered into a certain town , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off .
GNV	Luke	17	13	And they lifted up their voices and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
GNV	Luke	17	14	And when he saw them , he said unto them , ( D ) Go , show yourselves unto the Priests . And it came to pass , that as they went , they were cleansed .
GNV	Luke	17	15	Then one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice praised God ,
GNV	Luke	17	16	And fell down on his face at his feet , and gave him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
GNV	Luke	17	18	There is none found that returned to give God praise , save this stranger .
GNV	Luke	17	19	And he said unto him , Arise , go thy way , thy faith hath saved thee .
GNV	Luke	17	21	Neither shall men say , Lo here , or lo there : for behold , the kingdom of God is [ j ] within you .
GNV	Luke	17	22	[ k ] And he said unto the disciples , the days will come , when ye shall desire to see [ l ] one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
GNV	Luke	17	23	( E ) [ m ] Then they shall say to you , Behold here , or behold there : but go not thither , neither follow them .
GNV	Luke	17	24	For as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven , so shall the Son of man be in his day .
GNV	Luke	17	25	But first must he suffer many things and be reproved of this generation .
GNV	Luke	17	26	( F ) [ n ] And as it was in the days of Noah , so shall it be in the days of the Son of man .
GNV	Luke	17	27	They ate , they drank , they married wives , and gave in marriage unto the day that Noah went into the Ark : and the flood came , and destroyed them all .

GNV	Luke	17	31	[ o ] At that day he that is upon the house , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it out : and he that is in the field likewise , let him not turn back to that he left behind .

GNV	Luke	18	2	[ c ] Saying , there was a judge in a certain city , which feared not God , neither reverenced man .
GNV	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the Temple to pray : the one a Pharisee , and the other a Publican .
GNV	Luke	18	15	¶ ( C ) [ i ] They brought unto him also babes that he should touch them . [ j ] And when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
GNV	Luke	18	22	Now when Jesus heard that , he said unto him , yet lackest thou one thing , Sell all that ever thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come follow me .

GNV	Luke	18	35	¶ ( H ) [ s ] And it came to pass , that as he was come near unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the wayside , begging .
GNV	Luke	18	1	And [ a ] he spake also a parable unto them , to this end , that they ( A ) ought always to pray , and not to [ b ] wax faint ,
GNV	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that city , which came unto him , saying , Do me justice against mine adversary .
GNV	Luke	18	4	And he would not of a long time : but afterward he said with himself , Though I fear not God , nor reverence man ,
GNV	Luke	18	5	Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will do her right , lest at the last she come and [ d ] make me weary .
GNV	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , Hear what the unrighteous judge saith .
GNV	Luke	18	7	Now shall not God avenge his elect , which cry day and night unto him , yea , though [ e ] he suffer long for them ?
GNV	Luke	18	8	I tell you he will avenge them quickly : but when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
GNV	Luke	18	9	¶ [ f ] He spake also this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were just , and despised others .
GNV	Luke	18	11	[ g ] The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , O God , I thank thee that I am not as other men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this Publican .
GNV	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week : I give tithe of all that ever I possess .
GNV	Luke	18	13	But the Publican standing [ h ] afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven , but smote his breast , saying , O God , be merciful to me a sinner .
GNV	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man departed to his house , justified rather than the other : ( B ) for every man that exalteth himself shall be brought low , and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
GNV	Luke	18	16	[ k ] But Jesus [ l ] called them unto him , and said , Suffer the babes to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
GNV	Luke	18	17	[ m ] Verily I say unto you , whosoever receiveth not the kingdom of God as a babe , he shall not enter therein .
GNV	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , even God .
GNV	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments , ( E ) Thou shalt not commit adultery : Thou shalt not kill : Thou shalt not steal : Thou shalt not bear false witness : Honor thy father and thy mother .
GNV	Luke	18	21	[ n ] And he said , All these have I kept from my youth .
GNV	Luke	18	23	But when he heard those things , he was very heavy : for he was marvelous rich .
GNV	Luke	18	24	[ o ] And when Jesus saw him very sorrowful , he said , With what difficulty shall they that have riches , enter into the kingdom of God !
GNV	Luke	18	25	Surely it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
GNV	Luke	18	26	Then said they that heard it , And who then shall be saved ?
GNV	Luke	18	27	And he said , The things which are impossible with men , are possible with God .

GNV	Luke	18	34	But they understood [ r ] none of these things , and this saying was hid from them , neither perceived they the things , which were spoken .
GNV	Luke	18	36	And when he heard the people pass by , he asked what it meant .

GNV	Luke	18	38	Then he cried , saying , Jesus the Son of David , have mercy on me .
GNV	Luke	18	39	[ t ] And they which went before , rebuked him that he should hold his peace , but he cried much more , O Son of David have mercy on me .
GNV	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be brought unto him . And when he was come near , he asked him ,
GNV	Luke	18	41	Saying , What wilt thou that I do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight .
GNV	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .

GNV	Luke	19	45	¶ ( G ) [ v ] He went also into the Temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ,
GNV	Luke	19	1	Now [ a ] when Jesus entered and passed through Jericho ,
GNV	Luke	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus , who he should be , and could not for the press , because he was of a low stature .
GNV	Luke	19	4	Wherefore he ran before , and climbed up into a wild fig tree , that he might see him : for he should come that way .
GNV	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , come down at once : for today I must abide at thine house .
GNV	Luke	19	6	Then he came down hastily , and received him joyfully .
GNV	Luke	19	7	[ c ] And when all they saw it , they murmured , saying , that he was gone in to lodge with a sinful man .
GNV	Luke	19	8	[ d ] And Zacchaeus stood forth , and said unto the Lord , Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor : and if I have taken from any man by [ e ] forged cavillation , I restore him fourfold .
GNV	Luke	19	9	Then Jesus said to him , This day is salvation come unto this house , forasmuch as he is also become the [ f ] son of Abraham .
GNV	Luke	19	10	( A ) For the son of man is come to seek , and to save that which was lost .
GNV	Luke	19	11	[ g ] And while they heard these things , he continued and spake a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem , and because also they thought that the kingdom of God should shortly appear .
GNV	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , ( B ) A certain noble man went into a far country , to receive for himself a kingdom , and so to come again .
GNV	Luke	19	14	Now his citizens hated him , and sent an ambassage after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us .
GNV	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass , when he was come again , and had received his kingdom , that he commanded the servants to be called to him , to whom he gave his money , that he might know what every man had gained .
GNV	Luke	19	16	Then came the first , saying , Lord , [ i ] thy piece hath increased ten pieces .
GNV	Luke	19	17	And he said unto him , Well , good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little thing , take thou authority over ten cities .
GNV	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , Lord , thy piece hath increased five pieces .
GNV	Luke	19	20	[ j ] So the other came , and said , Lord , behold thy piece , which I have laid up in a napkin :
GNV	Luke	19	21	For I feared thee , because thou art a straight man : thou takest up that thou laidst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
GNV	Luke	19	22	Then he said unto him , Of thine own mouth will I judge thee , O evil servant . Thou knewest that I am a straight man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow .
GNV	Luke	19	23	Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the [ k ] bank , that at my coming I might have required it with vantage ?
GNV	Luke	19	24	And he said to them that stood by , Take from him that piece , and give it him that hath ten pieces .
GNV	Luke	19	25	( And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pieces . )
GNV	Luke	19	26	( C ) For I say unto you , that unto all them that have , it shall be given : and from him that hath not , even that he hath , shall be taken from him .
GNV	Luke	19	27	Moreover , those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
GNV	Luke	19	28	¶ And when he had thus spoken , [ l ] he went forth before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
GNV	Luke	19	29	( D ) [ m ] And it came to pass , when he was come near to Bethphage , and Bethany , besides the mount which is called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
GNV	Luke	19	30	Saying , Go ye to the town which is before you , wherein as soon as ye are come , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
GNV	Luke	19	31	And if any ask you , why ye loose him , thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
GNV	Luke	19	32	So they that were sent , went their way , and found it as he had said unto them .
GNV	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?
GNV	Luke	19	34	And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
GNV	Luke	19	35	¶ ( E ) So they brought him to Jesus , and they cast their garments on the colt , and set Jesus thereon .
GNV	Luke	19	36	And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
GNV	Luke	19	37	And when he was now come near to the going down of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice , and to praise God with a loud voice , for all the great works that they had seen ,
GNV	Luke	19	38	Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest places .
GNV	Luke	19	39	[ n ] Then some of the Pharisees of the company said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
GNV	Luke	19	40	But he answered , and said unto them , I tell you , that if these should hold their peace , the stones would cry .
GNV	Luke	19	42	[ p ] Saying , [ q ] O if thou hadst even known [ r ] at the least in this [ s ] thy day those things , which belong unto thy [ t ] peace ! but now are they hid from thine eyes .
GNV	Luke	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
GNV	Luke	19	44	And shall make thee even with the ground , and thy children which are in thee , and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone , because thou knewest not [ u ] that season of thy visitation .
GNV	Luke	19	46	Saying unto them , It is written , ( H ) Mine house is the house of prayer , ( I ) but ye have made it a den of thieves .
GNV	Luke	19	47	And he taught daily in the Temple . And the high Priests and the Scribes , and the chief of the people sought to destroy him .
GNV	Luke	19	48	But they could not find what they might do to him : for all the people hanged upon him when they heard him .

GNV	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
GNV	Luke	20	9	¶ ( B ) [ b ] Then began he to speak to the people this parable , A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen : and went into a strange country , for a great time .
GNV	Luke	20	21	And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest , and teachest right , neither dost thou accept [ h ] any man ’ s person , but teachest the way of God truly .
GNV	Luke	20	27	( F ) [ j ] Then came to him certain of the Sadducees ( which deny that there is any resurrection ) and they asked him ,
GNV	Luke	20	41	¶ ( I ) [ n ] Then said he unto them , How say they that Christ is David ’ s son ?
GNV	Luke	20	1	And ( A ) [ a ] it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the Temple , and preached the Gospel , the high Priests and the Scribes came upon him , with the Elders ,
GNV	Luke	20	2	And spake unto him , saying , Tell us by what authority thou doest these things , or who is he that hath given thee this authority ?
GNV	Luke	20	3	And he answered , and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing : tell me therefore :
GNV	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned within themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven , he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
GNV	Luke	20	6	But if we shall say , Of men , all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a Prophet .
GNV	Luke	20	7	Therefore they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
GNV	Luke	20	8	Then Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you , by what authority I do these things .
GNV	Luke	20	10	And at the time convenient he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen did beat him , and sent him away empty .
GNV	Luke	20	11	Again he sent yet another servant : and they did beat him , and foul entreated him , and sent him away empty .
GNV	Luke	20	12	Moreover he sent the third , and him they wounded , and cast out .
GNV	Luke	20	13	Then said the Lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be that they will do reverence when they see him .
GNV	Luke	20	14	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned with themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
GNV	Luke	20	15	So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What shall the Lord of the vineyard therefore do unto them ?
GNV	Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy these husbandmen , and will give out his vineyard to others . But when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
GNV	Luke	20	17	¶ And he beheld them , and said , What meaneth this then that is written , ( C ) The stone that the builders refused , that is made the head of the corner ?
GNV	Luke	20	18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone , shall be broken : and on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
GNV	Luke	20	19	Then the high Priests , and the Scribes the same hour went about to lay hands on him ( but they feared the people ) for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
GNV	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give Caesar tribute or no ?
GNV	Luke	20	23	But he perceived their [ i ] craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
GNV	Luke	20	24	Show me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered , and said , Caesars .
GNV	Luke	20	25	Then he said unto them , ( E ) Give then unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ’ s , and to God those which are God ’ s .
GNV	Luke	20	26	And they could not reprove his saying before the people : but they marveled at his answer , and held their peace .
GNV	Luke	20	28	Saying , Master , ( G ) Moses wrote unto us , If any man ’ s brother die having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
GNV	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brethren , and the first took a wife , and he died without children .
GNV	Luke	20	30	And the second took the wife , and he died childless .
GNV	Luke	20	31	Then the third took her : and so likewise the seven died , and left no children .
GNV	Luke	20	32	And last of all , the woman died also .
GNV	Luke	20	33	Therefore at the resurrection , whose wife of them shall she be ? for seven had her to wife .
GNV	Luke	20	34	Then Jesus answered , and said unto them , The [ k ] children of this world marry wives , and are married .
GNV	Luke	20	35	But they which shall be counted worthy to enjoy that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry wives , neither are married .
GNV	Luke	20	36	For they can die no more , forasmuch as they are equal unto the Angels , and are the sons of God , since they are the [ l ] children of the resurrection .
GNV	Luke	20	37	And that the dead shall rise again , even ( H ) Moses showed it besides the bush , when he said , The Lord is the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
GNV	Luke	20	38	For he is not the God of the dead , but of them which live : for all [ m ] live unto him .
GNV	Luke	20	39	Then certain of the Scribes answered , and said , Master , thou hast well said .
GNV	Luke	20	40	And after that , durst they not ask him anything at all .
GNV	Luke	20	42	And David himself saith in the book of the Psalms , ( J ) The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit at my right hand ,
GNV	Luke	20	43	Till I shall make thine enemies thy footstool .
GNV	Luke	20	44	Seeing David called him Lord , how is he then his son ?
GNV	Luke	20	45	¶ Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
GNV	Luke	20	46	( K ) [ o ] Beware of the Scribes , which willingly go in long robes , and love salutations in the markets , and the highest seats in the assemblies , and the chief rooms at feasts :
GNV	Luke	20	47	Which devour widow ’ s [ p ] houses , and in show make long prayers : These shall receive greater damnation .

GNV	Luke	21	1	And ( A ) [ a ] as he beheld , he saw the rich men which cast their gifts into the treasury .
GNV	Luke	21	5	( B ) [ b ] Now as some spake of the Temple , how it was garnished with goodly stones , and with [ c ] consecrated things , he said ,
GNV	Luke	21	19	By your patience [ g ] possess your souls .
GNV	Luke	21	25	( H ) [ k ] Then there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars , and upon the earth trouble among the nations , with perplexity : the sea and the waters shall roar .
GNV	Luke	21	2	And he saw also a certain poor widow which cast in thither two mites :
GNV	Luke	21	3	And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all .
GNV	Luke	21	4	For they all have of their superfluity cast into the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
GNV	Luke	21	6	Are these the things that ye look upon ? the days will come wherein a stone shall not be left upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down .
GNV	Luke	21	7	Then they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign shall there be when these things shall come to pass ?
GNV	Luke	21	8	( C ) And he said , Take heed , that ye be not deceived : for many will come [ d ] in my Name , saying , I am Christ , and the time draweth near : follow ye not them therefore .
GNV	Luke	21	9	[ e ] And when ye hear of wars and seditions , be not afraid : for these things must first come , but the end followeth not by and by .
GNV	Luke	21	10	Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ,
GNV	Luke	21	11	( D ) And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and hunger , and pestilence , and fearful things , and great signs shall there be from heaven .
GNV	Luke	21	12	But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the assemblies , and into prisons , and bring you before Kings and rulers for my Name ’ s sake .
GNV	Luke	21	13	And this shall turn to you , for a [ f ] testimonial .
GNV	Luke	21	14	( E ) Lay it up therefore in your hearts , that ye cast not beforehand what ye shall answer .
GNV	Luke	21	15	For I will give you a mouth , and wisdom where against all your adversaries shall not be able to speak nor resist .
GNV	Luke	21	16	Yea , ye shall be betrayed also of your parents and of your brethren , and kinsmen , and friends , and some of you shall they put to death .

GNV	Luke	21	26	[ l ] And men ’ s hearts shall fail them for fear and for looking after those things which shall come on the world : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .

GNV	Luke	21	28	And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads : ( I ) for your redemption draweth near .
GNV	Luke	21	29	[ m ] And he spake to them a parable , Behold , the fig tree , and all trees ,
GNV	Luke	21	30	When they now shoot forth , ye seeing them , know of your own selves , that summer is then near .
GNV	Luke	21	31	So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is near .

GNV	Luke	22	2	Kings 14:19.Is not the hand of Joab in this matter ? - Luke 22:22 Although the decree of God ’ s providence comes necessarily to pass , yet it excuseth not the fault of the instruments . - Luke 22:24 The Pastors are not called to rule , but to serve . - Luke 22:25 Have great titles , for so it was the custom to honor Princes with some great titles . - Luke 22:28 Such as are partakers of the afflictions of Christ , shall also be partakers of his kingdom . - Luke 22:31 We must always think upon the wait that Satan layeth for us . - Luke 22:31 To toss you and scatter you , and also to cast you out . - Luke 22:32 It is through the prayers of Christ , that the elect do never utterly fall away from the faith : and that for this cause , that they should stir up one another . - Luke 22:33 Christ showeth that faith differeth much from a vain security , in setting before us the grievous example of Peter . - Luke 22:36 All this talk is by way of an allegory , as if he said , O my friends and fellow soldiers , you have lived hitherto as it were in peace : but now there is a most sharp battle at hand to be fought , and therefore you must lay all other things aside , and think upon furnishing yourselves in armor . And what this armor is , he showeth by his own example , when he prayed afterward in the garden , and reproved Peter for striking with the sword . - Luke 22:40 Christ hath made death acceptable unto us , by overcoming in our name , all the horrors of death , which had joined with them the curse of God . - Luke 22:41 Prayers are a sure succor against the most perilous assaults of our enemies . - Luke 22:44 This agony showeth that Christ strove much , and was in great distress : for Christ strove not only with the fears of death , as other men used to do , for so many martyrs might seem more constant than Christ , but with the fearful judgment of his angry Father , which is the fearfullest thing in the world : and the matter was , for that he took the burden of all our sins upon himself . - Luke 22:44 These do not only show that Christ was true man , but other things also which the goodly have to consider of , wherein redemption of all mankind is contained in the son of God his debasing himself to the state of a servant : such things as no man can sufficiently declare . - Luke 22:45 Men are utterly sluggish , even in their greatest dangers until Christ stir them up . - Luke 22:47 Christ is willingly betrayed and taken , that by his obedience he might deliver us which were guilty for the betraying of God ’ s glory . - Luke 22:49 That zeal which carrieth us out of the bounds of our vocation , pleaseth not Christ . - Luke 22:52 Even the very fear of them which took Christ , proveth partly their evil conscience , and partly also that all these things were done by God ’ s providence . - Luke 22:53 The power that was given to darkness , to oppress the light for a season . - Luke 22:54 We have to behold in Peter an example both of the fragility of man ’ s nature , and of the singular goodness of God toward his elect . - Luke 22:63 Christ bare the shame that was due to our sins . - Luke 22:66 Christ is wrongfully condemned of blasphemy before the high Priest ’ s judgment seat , that we might be quit before God from the blasphemy which we deserved . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Luke	22	4	And he went his way , and communed with the high Priests and [ c ] captains , how he might betray him to them .
GNV	Luke	22	5	So they were glad , and agreed to give him money .
GNV	Luke	22	6	And he consented , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them , when the people were [ d ] away .
GNV	Luke	22	8	And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare us the [ g ] Passover that we may eat it .
GNV	Luke	22	9	And they said to him , Where wilt thou , that we prepare it ?
GNV	Luke	22	10	Then he said unto them , Behold , when ye be entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water : follow him into the house that he entereth in ,
GNV	Luke	22	11	And say unto the good man of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the lodging where I shall eat my Passover with my disciples ?
GNV	Luke	22	12	Then he shall show you a great high chamber trimmed : there make it ready .
GNV	Luke	22	13	So they went , and found as he had said unto them , and made ready the Passover .
GNV	Luke	22	14	( D ) [ h ] And when the [ i ] hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve Apostles with him .
GNV	Luke	22	15	Then he said unto them , I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you , before I [ j ] suffer .
GNV	Luke	22	16	For I say unto you , Henceforth I will not eat of it anymore , until it be fulfilleth in the kingdom of God .
GNV	Luke	22	17	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among you :
GNV	Luke	22	18	For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God be come .
GNV	Luke	22	19	( E ) [ k ] And he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and gave to them , saying , This is my body , which is given for you : do this in the remembrance of me .
GNV	Luke	22	20	Likewise also after supper he took the cup , saying , This [ l ] cup is [ m ] that new Testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
GNV	Luke	22	21	( F ) [ n ] Yet behold , the [ o ] hand of him that betrayeth me , is with me at the table .
GNV	Luke	22	23	Then they began to inquire among themselves which of them it should be , that should do that .
GNV	Luke	22	25	But he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles reign over them , and they that bear rule over them , are called [ r ] bountiful .
GNV	Luke	22	26	But ye shall not be so : but let the greatest among you be as the least : and the chiefest as he that serveth .
GNV	Luke	22	27	For who is greater , he that sitteth at table , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at table ? And I am among you as he that serveth .
GNV	Luke	22	28	[ s ] And ye are they which have continued with me in my tentations .
GNV	Luke	22	29	Therefore I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ,
GNV	Luke	22	30	( H ) That ye may eat , and drink at my table , in my kingdom , and sit on seats , and judge the twelve tribes of Israel .
GNV	Luke	22	32	[ v ] But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : therefore when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
GNV	Luke	22	33	( J ) [ w ] And he said unto him : Lord , I am ready to go with thee into prison , and to death .
GNV	Luke	22	34	But he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before thou hast thrice denied that thou knewest me .
GNV	Luke	22	36	[ x ] Then he said to them , But now he that hath a bag , let him take it , and likewise a scrip : and he that hath none , let him sell his coat , and buy a sword .
GNV	Luke	22	37	For I say unto you , That yet the same which is written , must be performed in me , ( L ) Even with the wicked was he numbered : for doubtless those things which are written of me , have an end .
GNV	Luke	22	38	And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough .
GNV	Luke	22	39	¶ ( M ) And he came out , and went ( as he was wont ) to the mount of Olives : and his disciples also followed him .
GNV	Luke	22	40	( N ) [ y ] And when he came to the place , he said to them , Pray , lest ye enter into tentation .
GNV	Luke	22	41	[ z ] And he was drawn aside from them about a stone ’ s cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
GNV	Luke	22	43	And there appeared an Angel unto him from heaven , comforting him .
GNV	Luke	22	45	[ ac ] And he rose up from prayer , and came to his disciples , and found them sleeping for heaviness .
GNV	Luke	22	46	And he said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into tentation .
GNV	Luke	22	47	¶ ( O ) [ ad ] And while he yet spake , behold , a company , and he that was called Judas one of the twelve , went before them , and came near unto Jesus to kiss him .
GNV	Luke	22	48	And Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
GNV	Luke	22	49	[ ae ] Now when they which were about him , saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
GNV	Luke	22	51	Then Jesus answered , and said , Suffer them thus far : and he touched his ear , and healed him .
GNV	Luke	22	52	of this Chapter . - Luke 22:6 Without tumult , unwitting to the people which used to follow him : and therefore indeed they watched their time , when they knew he was alone in the garden . - Luke 22:7 Christ teacheth his disciples by a manifest miracle , that although he be going to be crucified , yet nothing is hid from him : and therefore that he goeth willingly to death . - Luke 22:7 By the order appointed by the Law . - Luke 22:8 The lamb which was the figure of the Passover : And this is spoken by the figure metonymy , which is very usual in the matter of the Sacraments . - Luke 22:14 Christ having ended the Passover according to the order of the Law , forewarneth them that this shall be his last banquet with them , after the manner and necessity of this life . - Luke 22:14 The evening and twilight , at what time this supper was to be kept . - Luke 22:15 I am put to death . - Luke 22:19 Christ establisheth his new Covenant , and his communicating with us with new signs . - Luke 22:20 Here is a double Metonymy : for first the vessel is taken for that which is contained in the vessel , as the cup , for the wine which is within the cup . Then the wine is called the Covenant or Testament , whereas indeed it is but the sign of the Testament , or rather of the blood of Christ , whereby the Testament was made : neither is it a vain sign , though it be not all one with the thing that it representeth . - Luke 22:20 This word , that , showeth the excellency of the Testament , and answereth to the place of Jeremiah , Chapter 31:31 , where the new Testament is promised . - Luke 22:21 Christ showeth again that he goeth to death willingly , although he be not ignorant of Judas ’ s treason . - Luke 22:21 That is , his practice , so use the Hebrews to speak ,
GNV	Luke	22	53	When I was daily with you in the Temple , ye stretched not forth the hands against me : but this is your very hour , and the [ ag ] power of darkness .
GNV	Luke	22	54	¶ ( P ) Then took they him , and led him , and brought him to the high Priest ’ s house . [ ah ] And Peter followed afar off .
GNV	Luke	22	55	( Q ) And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter also sat down among them .
GNV	Luke	22	56	And a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and having well looked on him , said , This man was also with him .
GNV	Luke	22	59	And about the space of an hour after , a certain other affirmed , saying . Verily , even this man was with him : for he is also a Galilean .
GNV	Luke	22	61	Then the Lord turned back , and looked upon Peter : and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , ( R ) Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
GNV	Luke	22	62	And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
GNV	Luke	22	64	And when they had blindfolded him , they smote him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy who it is that smote thee .
GNV	Luke	22	65	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
GNV	Luke	22	66	( T ) [ aj ] And as soon as it was day , the Elders of the people , and the high Priests and the Scribes came together , and led him into their Council ,
GNV	Luke	22	67	Saying , Art thou that Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe it .
GNV	Luke	22	68	And if also I ask you , you will not answer me , nor let me go .
GNV	Luke	22	70	Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said to them , Ye say , that I am .
GNV	Luke	22	71	Then said they , What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard it of his own mouth . Footnotes - Luke 22:1 Christ is taken upon the day of the Passover , rather by the providence of his Father , than by the will of men . - Luke 22:3 God by his wonderful providence , causeth him to be the minister of our salvation , who was the author of our destruction . - Luke 22:4 They that had the charge of keeping the Temple , which were none of the Priests and Bishops , as appeareth by verse
GNV	Luke	23	23	But they were instant with loud voices , and required that he might be crucified : and the voices of them and of the high Priests prevailed .

GNV	Luke	23	1	Then [ a ] the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto Pilate .
GNV	Luke	23	7	And when he knew that he was of [ d ] Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , which was also at Jerusalem in those days .
GNV	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his [ e ] men of war , despised him , and mocked him , and arrayed him in white , and sent him again to Pilate .
GNV	Luke	23	24	So Pilate gave sentence , that it should be as they required .
GNV	Luke	23	27	[ l ] And there followed him a great multitude of people , and of women , which women bewailed and lamented him .
GNV	Luke	23	33	[ n ] And when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the evildoers : one at the right hand , and the other at the left .
GNV	Luke	23	39	¶ [ r ] And [ s ] one of the evildoers , which were hanged , railed on him , saying , If thou be that Christ , save thyself and us .
GNV	Luke	23	43	Then Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , today shalt thou be with me in [ u ] Paradise .
GNV	Luke	23	45	[ w ] And the Sun was darkened , and the veil of the Temple rent through the midst .
GNV	Luke	23	53	And took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid it in a tomb hewn out of a rock , wherein was never man yet laid .
GNV	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse him , saying , We have found this man [ b ] perverting the nation , ( A ) and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar , saying , That he is Christ a King .
GNV	Luke	23	3	( B ) And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him , and said , Thou sayest it .
GNV	Luke	23	4	Then said Pilate to the high Priests , and to the people , I find no fault in this man .
GNV	Luke	23	5	But they were the more fierce , saying , He moveth the people , teaching throughout all Judea , beginning at Galilee , even to this place .
GNV	Luke	23	6	[ c ] Now when Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilean .
GNV	Luke	23	8	And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him , and trusteth to have seen some sign done by him .
GNV	Luke	23	9	Then questioned he with him of many things : but he answered him nothing .
GNV	Luke	23	10	The high Priests also and Scribes stood forth and accused him vehemently .
GNV	Luke	23	12	[ f ] And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were enemies one to another .
GNV	Luke	23	13	¶ [ g ] Then Pilate called together the high Priests , and the [ h ] rulers , and the people ,
GNV	Luke	23	14	( C ) And said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverted the people : and behold , I have examined him before you , and have found no fault in this man , of those things whereof ye accuse him :
GNV	Luke	23	15	No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him : and lo , nothing worthy of death is done of him .
GNV	Luke	23	16	[ i ] I will therefore chastise him , and let him loose .
GNV	Luke	23	17	( For of necessity he must have let one loose unto them at the feast . )
GNV	Luke	23	18	Then all the multitude cried at once , saying , Away with him , and deliver unto us Barabbas :
GNV	Luke	23	19	Which for a certain insurrection made in the city , and murder , was cast in prison .
GNV	Luke	23	20	Then Pilate spake again to them , willing to let Jesus loose .
GNV	Luke	23	21	But they cried , saying , Crucify , crucify him .
GNV	Luke	23	22	years , John the Baptist preached and was put to death , and Jesus Christ also died and rose again , and the Apostles began to preach , and divers things were done at Jerusalem almost seven years after Christ ’ s death . This Herod was sent into banishment to Lyons , about the second year of Gaius Caesar . - Luke 23:11 Accompanied with his nobles and soldiers which followed him from Galilee . - Luke 23:12 The hatred of godliness joineth the wicked together . - Luke 23:13 Christ is quit the second time , even of him of whom he is condemned , that it might appear , how he being just , redeemed us which were unjust . - Luke 23:13 Those whom the Jews called the Sanhedrin . - Luke 23:16 The wisdom of the flesh , of two evils chooseth the less , but God curseth such counsels . - Luke 23:22 Christ is quit the third time , before he was condemned once , that it might appear , how that our sins were condemned in him . - Luke 23:26 An example of the outrageousness and disorder of the soldiers . - Luke 23:27 The triumph of the wicked hath a most horrible end . - Luke 23:31 As if he said , If they do thus to me that am fruitful , and always flourishing , and who lives forever by reason of my Godhead , what will they do to you , that are unfruitful and void of all lively righteousness ? - Luke 23:33 Christ became accursed for us upon the Cross , suffering the punishment which they deserved that would be God ’ s . - Luke 23:34 Christ in praying for his enemies , showeth that he is both the sacrifice and the Priest . - Luke 23:35 Whom God loveth more than all others . - Luke 23:38 Pilate at unawares is made a preacher of the kingdom of Christ . - Luke 23:39 Therefore either we must take that spoken by Synecdoche which Matthew saith , or that both of them mocked Christ .

GNV	Luke	23	25	And he let loose unto them him that for insurrection and murder was cast into prison , whom they desired , and delivered Jesus to do with him what they would .
GNV	Luke	23	26	¶ ( D ) [ k ] And as they led him away , they caught one Simon of Cyrene , coming out of the field , and on him they laid the cross , to bear it after Jesus .
GNV	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turned back unto them , and said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
GNV	Luke	23	29	For behold , the days will come , when men shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
GNV	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , ( E ) Fall on us : and to the hills , Cover us .
GNV	Luke	23	31	( F ) For if they do these things to a [ m ] green tree , what shall be done to the dry ?
GNV	Luke	23	32	( G ) And there were two others , which were evildoers , led with him to be slain .
GNV	Luke	23	34	[ o ] Then said Jesus , Father , forgive them : for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
GNV	Luke	23	35	And the people stood , and beheld : and the rulers mocked him with them , saying , He saved others : let him save himself , if he be that Christ the [ p ] Chosen of God .
GNV	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also mocked him , and came and offered him vinegar ,
GNV	Luke	23	37	And said , If thou be the King of the Jews , save thyself .
GNV	Luke	23	38	[ q ] And a superscription was also written over him , in Greek letters , and in Latin , and in Hebrew , THIS IS THAT KING OF THE JEWS .
GNV	Luke	23	40	But the other answered , and rebuked him , saying , Fearest thou not God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
GNV	Luke	23	41	We are indeed righteously here : for we receive things worthy of that we have done : but this man hath done nothing [ t ] amiss .
GNV	Luke	23	42	And he said unto Jesus , Lord , remember me , when thou comest into thy kingdom .
GNV	Luke	23	44	¶ [ v ] And it was about the sixth hour : and there was a darkness over all the land , until the ninth hour .
GNV	Luke	23	46	And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and said , ( H ) Father , into thine hands I commend my spirit . And when he thus had said , he gave up the ghost .
GNV	Luke	23	47	¶ [ x ] Now when the Centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Of a surety this man was just .
GNV	Luke	23	48	And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done : smote their breasts , and returned .
GNV	Luke	23	49	[ y ] And all his acquaintances stood afar off , and the women that followed him from Galilee , beholding these things .
GNV	Luke	23	50	¶ ( I ) [ z ] And behold , there was a man named Joseph , which was a counselor , a good man and a just .
GNV	Luke	23	51	He did not consent to the counsel and deed of them , which was of Arimathea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
GNV	Luke	23	52	He went unto Pilate , and asked the body of Jesus ,
GNV	Luke	23	54	And that day was the preparation , and the Sabbath [ aa ] drew on .
GNV	Luke	23	55	[ ab ] And the women also that followed after , which came with him from Galilee , beheld the sepulcher , and how his body was laid .

GNV	Luke	24	9	[ c ] And returned from the sepulcher , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the remnant .
GNV	Luke	24	13	¶ ( D ) [ f ] And behold two of them went that same day to a town which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs , called Emmaus .
GNV	Luke	24	27	And he began at Moses , and at all the Prophets , and interpreted unto them in all the Scriptures the things which were written of him .
GNV	Luke	24	39	Behold mine hands and my feet : for it is I myself : handle me , and see : for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
GNV	Luke	24	49	And behold , I do send the ( F ) promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , [ p ] until ye be endued with power from on high .
GNV	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass , that as he blessed them , ( G ) he departed from them , and was carried up into heaven .
GNV	Luke	24	1	Now the ( A ) [ a ] first day of the week [ b ] early in the morning , they came unto the sepulcher , and brought the odors which they had prepared , and certain women with them .
GNV	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher ,
GNV	Luke	24	3	And went in , but found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
GNV	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , that as they were amazed thereat , behold , two men suddenly stood by them in shining vestures .
GNV	Luke	24	5	And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said to them , Why seek ye him that liveth , among the dead ?
GNV	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen : remember ( B ) how he spake unto you , when he was yet in Galilee ,
GNV	Luke	24	7	Saying , that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
GNV	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words ,
GNV	Luke	24	10	Now it was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women with them which told these things unto the Apostles .
GNV	Luke	24	11	But their words seemed unto them as a feigned thing , neither believed they them .
GNV	Luke	24	12	( C ) [ d ] Then arose Peter and ran unto the sepulcher , and [ e ] looked in and saw the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
GNV	Luke	24	14	And they talked together of all these things that were done .
GNV	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass , as they communed together , and reasoned , that Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
GNV	Luke	24	16	[ g ] But their eyes were holden , that they could not know him .
GNV	Luke	24	17	And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad ?
GNV	Luke	24	18	And [ h ] the one ( named Cleopas ) answered and said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein in these days ?
GNV	Luke	24	19	And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , Of Jesus of Nazareth , which was a Prophet , mighty indeed and in word before God , and all people ,
GNV	Luke	24	20	[ i ] And how the high Priests , and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
GNV	Luke	24	21	But we trusted that it had been he that should have delivered Israel , and as touching all these things , today is the third day , that they were done .
GNV	Luke	24	22	Yea , and certain women among us made us astonied , which came early unto the sepulcher .
GNV	Luke	24	23	And when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of Angels , which said , that he was alive .
GNV	Luke	24	25	Then he said unto them , O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken !
GNV	Luke	24	26	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ?
GNV	Luke	24	28	And they drew near unto the town , which they went to , but he made as though he would have gone further .
GNV	Luke	24	29	But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us , for it is towards night , and the day is far spent . So he went in to tarry with them .
GNV	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , as he sat at table with them , he took the bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave it to them .
GNV	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were opened , and they knew him : and he was [ j ] no more seen of them .
GNV	Luke	24	32	And they said between themselves , Did not our hearts burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and when he opened to us the Scriptures ?
GNV	Luke	24	33	And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
GNV	Luke	24	34	Which said , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
GNV	Luke	24	35	Then they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in [ k ] breaking of bread .
GNV	Luke	24	36	¶ ( E ) [ l ] And as they spake these things , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and said unto them , Peace be to you .
GNV	Luke	24	37	But they were abashed and afraid , supposing that they had seen a spirit .
GNV	Luke	24	38	Then he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do [ m ] doubts arise in your hearts ?
GNV	Luke	24	40	And when he had thus spoken , he showed them his hands and feet .
GNV	Luke	24	41	And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ?
GNV	Luke	24	42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb ,
GNV	Luke	24	43	And he took it , and did eat before them .
GNV	Luke	24	44	[ n ] And he said unto them , These are the words , which I spake unto you while I was yet with you , that all must be fulfilled which are written of me in the Law of Moses , and in the Prophets , and in the Psalms .
GNV	Luke	24	45	Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the Scriptures ,
GNV	Luke	24	46	And said unto them , Thus is it written , and thus it behooved Christ to suffer , and to rise again from the dead the third day ,
GNV	Luke	24	47	And that repentance , and remission of sins should be preached in his Name among all nations , [ o ] beginning at Jerusalem .
GNV	Luke	24	48	Now ye are witnesses of these things .
GNV	Luke	24	50	[ q ] Afterward he lead them out into Bethany , and lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
GNV	Luke	24	52	And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy ,
GNV	Luke	24	53	And were continually in the Temple , praising , and lauding God . Amen .

GNV	John	1	2	This same was in the beginning with God .
GNV	John	1	14	( D ) [ z ] And that Word was made [ aa ] flesh , and [ ab ] dwelt among us , ( and we ( E ) saw the [ ac ] glory thereof , [ ad ] as the glory of the only begotten Son of the Father ) [ ae ] full of grace and truth .
GNV	John	1	6	¶ ( B ) [ p ] There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
GNV	John	1	7	This same came for a witness , to bear witness of that light , that all men [ q ] through him might believe .
GNV	John	1	15	¶ [ af ] John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I said , He that cometh [ ag ] after me , was [ ah ] before me : for he was better than I .
GNV	John	1	19	¶ [ an ] Then this is the record of John , when the Jews sent Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
GNV	John	1	20	And he [ ao ] confessed and [ ap ] denied not , and said plainly , I ( H ) am not that Christ .
GNV	John	1	40	Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , was one of the two which had heard it of John , and that followed him .
GNV	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . And Jesus beheld him , and said , Thou art Simon the son of Jonah : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation a stone .
GNV	John	1	43	¶ The day following , Jesus would go into Galilee , and found Philip , and said unto him , Follow me .
GNV	John	1	45	[ bi ] Philip found Nathanael , and said unto him , We have found him of whom ( L ) Moses did write in the Law , and the ( M ) Prophets , Jesus that Son of Joseph , that was of Nazareth .
GNV	John	1	3	( A ) [ g ] All [ h ] things were made by it , and [ i ] without it [ j ] was made nothing that was made .
GNV	John	1	4	[ k ] In it [ l ] was life , and that life was [ m ] the light of men .
GNV	John	1	5	[ n ] And that light shineth in the wilderness , and the darkness [ o ] comprehendeth it not .
GNV	John	1	8	He was not [ r ] that light , but was sent to bear witness of that light .
GNV	John	1	9	[ s ] This was [ t ] that true light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
GNV	John	1	10	[ u ] He was in the world , and the world was ( C ) made by him : and the world knew him not .
GNV	John	1	11	He came [ v ] unto his own , and his own received him not .
GNV	John	1	12	[ w ] But as many as received him , to them he gave [ x ] prerogative to be the sons of God , even to them that believe in his Name ,
GNV	John	1	13	Which are born not of blood , nor of the [ y ] will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .

The like kind of turning the reason we find in Luke 7:47 : many sins are forgiven her , because she loved much , which is thus much to say , she loved much , because many sins are forgiven her . - John 1:16 Christ is the most plentiful fountain of all goodness , but then he poured out his gifts most bountifully , when as he exhibited and showed himself to the world . - John 1:16 That is grace upon grace , as a man would say graces heaped one upon another . - John 1:18 That true knowledge of God proceedeth only from Jesus Christ . - John 1:18 Who is nearest to his Father , not only in respect of his love towards him , but by the bond of nature , and for that union or oneness that is between them , whereby the Father and the Son are one . - John 1:18 Revealed him , and showed him unto us , whereas before he was hid under the shadows of the Law , so that the quickness of the sight of our minds was not able to perceive him : for whosoever seeth him , seeth the Father also . - John 1:19 John is neither the Messiah , nor like to any of the other Prophets , but is the herald of Christ , who is now present . - John 1:20 He did acknowledge him , and spake of him plainly and openly . - John 1:20 This repeating of the one and the selfsame thing , though in divers words , is used much of the Hebrews , and it hath great force : for they used to speak one thing twice , to set it out more certainly and plainly . - John 1:21 The Jews thought that Elijah should come again before the days of Messiah , and they took the ground of that their opinion out of Mal . 4:5 , which place is to be understood of John , Matt . 11:14 . And yet John denieth that he is Elijah , answering them indeed according as they meant . - John 1:21 They inquire of some great Prophet , and not of Christ , for John denied before , that he is Christ , for they thought that some great Prophet should be sent like unto Moses , wresting to that purpose that place of Deut . 18:15 , which is to be understood of all the company of the Prophets and ministers , which have been and shall be to the end , and especially of Christ , who is the head of all Prophets . - John 1:24 Christ is the author of baptism , and not John : and therefore the force thereof consisteth not in John , who is the minister , but wholly in Christ the Lord . - John 1:25 Hereby we may prove that the Jews knew there should be some change in religion under Messiah . - John 1:26 Whom all the world seeth not , and is even amongst you . - John 1:29 The body and truth of all the sacrifices of the Law , to make satisfaction for the sin of the world , is in Christ . - John 1:29 This word ( That ) which is added , hath great force in it , not only to set forth the worthiness of Christ , and so to separate him from the Lamb which was a figure of him , and from all other sacrifices of the Law , but also to bring into our mind the Prophecies of Isaiah and others . - John 1:29 This word of the present time signifieth a continual act , for the Lamb hath this virtue proper unto him , and forever , to take away the sins of the world . - John 1:29 That is , that root of sins , to wit , our corruption , and so consequently , the fruits of sin , which are commonly called in the plural number sins . - John 1:31 I never knew him by face before . - John 1:32 Christ is proved to be the Son of God , by the coming down of the holy Ghost , by the Father ’ s voice , and by John ’ s testimony . - John 1:34 This word ( That ) pointeth out unto us some excellent thing , and maketh a difference between Christ and others , whom Moses and the Prophets commonly call the sons of God , or the sons of the most high . - John 1:35 John gathered disciples , not to himself , but to Christ . - John 1:36 Christ is set before us to follow not as a vain shadow , but as our Mediator . - John 1:37 In this first gathering of the disciples we have shown unto us , that the beginning of salvation is from God , who calleth us unto his Son by the ministry of his servants : whom ( so preventing us ) we must also hear , and follow him home , that being instructed by him , we may also instruct others . - John 1:38 Where is thy lodging ? - John 1:39 The night grew on . - John 1:41 That is , anointed , and King after the manner of the Jewish people . - John 1:45 The good endeavors even of the unlearned , God doth so allow , that he maketh them masters to the learned . - John 1:46 We must especially take heed of false presumptions , which shut up against us the entrance to Christ . - John 1:47 Simple uprightness discerneth the true Israelites from the false . - John 1:48 The end of miracles is to set before us Christ the Almighty , and also the only author of our salvation , that we may apprehend him by faith . - John 1:51 By these words the power of God is signified which should appear in his ministry by the angels serving him as the head of the Church .

GNV	John	1	17	For the Law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
GNV	John	1	18	( G ) [ ak ] No man hath seen God at any time : that only begotten Son , which is in the [ al ] bosom of the Father , he hath [ am ] declared him .
GNV	John	1	21	And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elijah ? And he said , [ aq ] I am not . Art thou [ ar ] that Prophet ? And he answered , No .
GNV	John	1	22	Then said they unto him , Who art thou , that we may give an answer to them that sent us ? What sayest thou of thyself ?
GNV	John	1	23	He said , I ( I ) am the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the Prophet Isaiah .
GNV	John	1	24	[ as ] Now they which were sent , were of the Pharisees .
GNV	John	1	25	And they asked him , and said unto him , [ at ] Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , neither Elijah , nor that Prophet ?
GNV	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there is one [ au ] among you , whom ye know not .
GNV	John	1	27	( J ) He it is that cometh after me , which was before me , whose shoe latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
GNV	John	1	28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John did baptize .
GNV	John	1	29	¶ [ av ] The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold [ aw ] that Lamb of God , which [ ax ] taketh away the [ ay ] sin of the world .
GNV	John	1	30	This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man , which was before me : for he was better than I .
GNV	John	1	31	And [ az ] I knew him not : but because he should be declared to Israel , therefore am I come , baptizing with water .
GNV	John	1	32	[ ba ] So John bare record , saying , I beheld , ( K ) that Spirit come down from heaven , like a dove , and it abode upon him ,
GNV	John	1	33	And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , he said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see that Spirit come down , and tarry still on him , that is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost .
GNV	John	1	34	And I saw , and bare record that this is [ bb ] that Son of God .
GNV	John	1	35	¶ [ bc ] The next day , John stood again , and two of his disciples .
GNV	John	1	36	[ bd ] And he beheld Jesus walking by , and said , Behold that Lamb of God .
GNV	John	1	37	[ be ] And the two disciples heard him speak , and followed Jesus .
GNV	John	1	38	Then Jesus turned about , and saw them follow , and said unto them , What seek ye ? And they said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say by interpretation , Master ) [ bf ] where dwellest thou ?
GNV	John	1	39	He said unto them , Come , and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the [ bg ] tenth hour .
GNV	John	1	41	The same found his brother Simon first , and said unto him , We have found that Messiah which is by interpretation , that [ bh ] Christ .
GNV	John	1	44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
GNV	John	1	46	[ bj ] Then Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip said to him , Come , and see .
GNV	John	1	47	[ bk ] Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and said of him , Behold indeed an Israelite , in whom is no guile .
GNV	John	1	48	[ bl ] Nathanael said unto him , Whence knewest thou me ? Jesus answered , and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
GNV	John	1	49	Nathanael answered , and said unto him , Rabbi , thou art that Son of God : thou art that King of Israel .
GNV	John	1	50	Jesus answered , and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .

GNV	John	2	1	And [ a ] the [ b ] third day , was there a marriage in Cana a town of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there .
GNV	John	2	11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana a town of Galilee , and showed forth his glory : and his disciples believed on him .
GNV	John	2	12	After that , he went down into Capernaum , he and his mother , and his [ h ] brethren , and his disciples : but they continued not many days there .
GNV	John	2	13	[ i ] For the Jews ’ Passover was at hand . Therefore Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
GNV	John	2	15	Then he made a scourge of small cords and drove them all out of the Temple with the sheep and oxen , and poured out the changers ’ money , and overthrew their tables ,
GNV	John	2	19	Jesus answered , and said unto them , ( B ) Destroy this Temple , and in three days I will raise it up again .
GNV	John	2	23	Now when he was at Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast , many believed in his Name , when they saw his miracles which he did .
GNV	John	2	3	[ c ] Now when the wine failed , the mother of Jesus said unto him , They have no wine .
GNV	John	2	4	Jesus said unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine [ d ] hour is not yet come .
GNV	John	2	5	His mother said unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
GNV	John	2	6	And there were set there , six [ e ] waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three [ f ] firkins apiece .
GNV	John	2	7	And Jesus said unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . Then they filled them up to the brim .
GNV	John	2	8	Then he said unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . So they bare it .
GNV	John	2	9	Now when the governor of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , ( for he knew not whence it was , but the servants , which drew the water , knew ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
GNV	John	2	10	And said unto him , All men at the beginning set forth good wine , and when men have [ g ] well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept back the good wine until now .
GNV	John	2	14	[ j ] And he found in the Temple those that sold oxen , and sheep , and doves , and changers of money sitting there .
GNV	John	2	16	And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence : make not my father ’ s house , an house of merchandise .
GNV	John	2	17	And his disciples remembered , that it was written , ( A ) The [ k ] zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
GNV	John	2	18	[ l ] Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , What [ m ] sign showest thou unto us , that thou doest these things ?
GNV	John	2	20	Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this Temple a building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
GNV	John	2	21	But he spake of the [ n ] temple of his body .
GNV	John	2	22	As soon therefore as he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he thus said unto them : and they believed the Scriptures , and the word which Jesus had said .
GNV	John	2	24	[ o ] But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew them all .
GNV	John	2	25	[ p ] And had no need that any should testify of man , for he knew what was in man . Footnotes - John 2:1 Christ declaring openly in an assembly by a notable miracle , that he hath power over the nature of things , to feed man ’ s body , leadeth the minds of all men , to his spiritual and saving virtue and power . - John 2:1 After the talk which he had with Nathanael , or after that he departured from John , or after that he came into Galilee . - John 2:3 Christ is careful enough of our salvation , and therefore hath no need of others to put him in mind of it . - John 2:4 Mine appointed time . - John 2:6 These were vessels appointed for water , wherein they washed themselves . - John 2:6 Every firkin contained an hundred pounds , at twelve ounces the pound : Whereby we gather that Christ helped them with a thousand and eight hundred pounds of wine . - John 2:10 Word for word , are drunken .

GNV	John	3	4	Nicodemus said unto him , How [ h ] can a man be born which is old ? can he enter into his mother ’ s womb again , and be born ?
GNV	John	3	5	. - John 3:3 The Church : for Christ showeth in this place , how we come to be citizens , and to have ought to do in the city of God . - John 3:4 How can I that am old , be born again ? for he answereth , as if Christ ’ s words belonged to none but to him . - John 3:6 That is , fleshly , to wit , wholly unclean and under the wrath of God : and therefore this word ( Flesh ) signifieth the corrupt nature of man : contrary to which is the Spirit , that is , the man ingrafted into Christ through the grace of the holy Ghost , whose nature is everlasting and immortal , though the strife of the flesh remaineth . - John 3:8 With free and wandering blasts , as it listeth . - John 3:9 The secret mystery of our regeneration which can not be comprehended by man ’ s capacity , is perceived by faith , and that in Christ only , because that he is both God on earth , and man in heaven , that is to say , in such sort man , that he is God also , and therefore almighty : and in such sort God , that he is man also , and therefore his power is manifest unto us . - John 3:11 You handle doubtful things , and such as you have no certain author for , and yet men believe you : but I teach those things that are of a truth and well known , and you believe me not . - John 3:13 Only Christ can teach us heavenly things for no man ascendeth , etc . - John 3:13 That is , hath any spiritual light and understanding , or ever had , but only that Son of God , which came down to us . - John 3:13 Whereas he is said to have come down from heaven , that must be understood of his Godhead , and of the manner of his conception : for Christ ’ s birth upon the earth was heavenly , and not earthly , for he was conceived by the holy Ghost . - John 3:13 That which is proper to the divinity of Christ , is here spoken of whole Christ , to give us to understand that he is but one person , wherein two natures are united , and this kind of speech men call , the communicating of proprieties . - John 3:16 Nothing else but the free love of the Father , is the beginning of our salvation , and Christ is he in whom our righteousness and salvation is resident : and faith is the instrument or mean whereby we apprehend it , and life everlasting is that which is set before us to apprehend . - John 3:16 It is not all one to believe in a thing , and to believe of a thing , for we may not believe ( in anything ) save only in God , but we may believe ( of anything ) whatsoever , this saith Nazianzene in his oration of the Spirit . - John 3:17 Not Christ , but the despising of Christ doth condemn . - John 3:17 That is , to be the cause of the condemning of the world , for indeed sins are the cause of death , but Christ shall judge the quick and the dead . - John 3:17 Not only the people of the Jews , but whosoever shall believe in him . - John 3:19 Only wickedness is the cause , why men refuse the light that is offered them . - John 3:19 That is , the cause of condemnation , which sticketh fast in men , unless through God ’ s great benefit they be delivered from it . - John 3:21 That is , he that leadeth an honest life , and void of all craft and deceit . - John 3:21 That is , with God , God as it were going before . - John 3:25 Satan inflameth the disciples of John with a fond emulation of their master , to hinder the course of the Gospel : but John being mindful of his office , doth not only break off their endeavors , but also taketh occasion thereby to give testimony of Christ , how that in him only the Father hath set forth life everlasting . - John 3:27 What mean you to go about to better my state ? this is every man ’ s lot and portion that they can not better themselves one iota . - John 3:31 Is nothing else but man , a piece of work and of the slime of the earth . - John 3:31 Savoreth of nothing but corruption , ignorance , dullness , etc . - John 3:32 What he knoweth fully and perfectly . - John 3:32 That is , very few . - John 3:35 Committed them to his power and will . - John 3:36 Shall not enjoy .

GNV	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh , is [ i ] flesh : and that that is born of the Spirit , is spirit .
GNV	John	3	7	Marvel not that I said to thee , Ye must be born again .
GNV	John	3	8	The wind bloweth where it [ j ] listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every man that is born of the Spirit .
GNV	John	3	9	[ k ] Nicodemus answered , and said unto him , How can these things be ?
GNV	John	3	10	Jesus answered , and said unto him , Art thou a teacher of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
GNV	John	3	11	Verily , verily I say unto thee , We speak that we know , and testify that we have seen : but ye receive not our [ l ] witness .
GNV	John	3	12	If when I tell you earthly things , ye believe not , how should ye believe , If I shall tell you of heavenly things ?
GNV	John	3	13	For no [ m ] man [ n ] ascendeth up to heaven , but he that had descended from heaven , [ o ] that Son of man which [ p ] is in heaven .
GNV	John	3	15	That whosoever believeth in him , should not perish , but have eternal life .
GNV	John	3	16	( B ) [ q ] For God so loveth the world , that he hath given his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth [ r ] in him , should not perish , but have everlasting life .
GNV	John	3	17	( C ) [ s ] For God sent not his Son into the world , that he should [ t ] condemn the world , but that the [ u ] world through him might be saved .
GNV	John	3	18	He that believeth in him , is not condemned : but he that believeth not , is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the Name of that only begotten Son of God .
GNV	John	3	19	( D ) [ v ] And this is the [ w ] condemnation , that that light came into the world , and men loved darkness rather than that light , because their deeds were evil .
GNV	John	3	20	For every man that evil doeth , hateth the light , neither cometh to light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
GNV	John	3	21	But he that [ x ] doeth truth , cometh to the light , that his deeds might be made manifest , that they are wrought [ y ] according to God .
GNV	John	3	22	¶ After these things came Jesus , and his disciples into the land of Judea , and there tarried with them , and ( E ) baptized .
GNV	John	3	24	For John was not yet cast into prison .
GNV	John	3	25	[ z ] Then there arose a question between John ’ s disciples and the Jews , about purifying .
GNV	John	3	26	And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom ( F ) thou barest witness , behold , he baptizeth , and all men come to him .
GNV	John	3	28	Ye yourselves are my witnesses , that ( G ) I said , I am not that Christ , but that I am sent before him .
GNV	John	3	29	He that hath the bride , is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly , because of the bridegroom ’ s voice . This my joy therefore is fulfilled .
GNV	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
GNV	John	3	31	He that is come from on high , is above all : he that is of the earth , is of the [ ab ] earth , and [ ac ] speaketh of the earth : he that is come from heaven , is above all .
GNV	John	3	32	And what he hath [ ad ] seen and heard , that he testifieth : but [ ae ] no man receiveth his testimony .
GNV	John	3	33	He that hath receiveth his testimony , hath sealed that ( H ) God is true .
GNV	John	3	34	For he whom God hath sent , speaketh the words of God : for God giveth him not the Spirit by measure .
GNV	John	3	35	The Father loveth the Son , and hath ( I ) [ af ] given all things into his hand .
GNV	John	3	36	( J ) He that believeth in the Son , hath everlasting life , and he that obeyeth not the Son , shall not [ ag ] see life , but the wrath of God abideth on him .

GNV	John	4	6	And there was Jacob ’ s Well . Jesus then wearied in the journey , sat [ c ] thus on the Well : it was about the [ d ] sixth hour .
GNV	John	4	21	Jesus said unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor at Jerusalem worship the Father .
GNV	John	4	26	Jesus said unto her , I am he , that speak unto thee .
GNV	John	4	32	[ l ] But he said unto them , I have meat to eat , that ye know not of .
GNV	John	4	39	[ p ] Now many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him , for the saying of the woman which testified , He hath told me all things that ever I did .
GNV	John	4	46	[ s ] And Jesus came again into ( H ) Cana a town of Galilee , where he had made of water wine . And there was a certain [ t ] ruler , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
GNV	John	4	1	Now [ a ] when the Lord knew , how the Pharisees had heard , that Jesus made ( A ) and baptized more disciples than John ,
GNV	John	4	2	( Though Jesus himself baptized not : but his disciples . )
GNV	John	4	3	He left Judea , and departed again into Galilee .
GNV	John	4	5	[ b ] Then came he to a city of Samaria called Sychar , near unto the possession that ( B ) Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
GNV	John	4	7	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water . Jesus said unto her , Give me drink .
GNV	John	4	8	For his disciples were gone away into the city , to buy meat .
GNV	John	4	9	Then said the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it , that thou being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? For the Jews [ e ] meddle not with the Samaritans .
GNV	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest [ f ] that gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me drink , thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee [ g ] water of life .
GNV	John	4	11	. - John 4:23 This word ( Spirit ) is to be taken here , as it is set against that commandment , which is called carnal , Heb . 7:16 , as the commandment is considered in itself : and so he speaketh of ( Truth ) not as we set it against a lie , but as we take it in respect of the outward ceremonies of the Law : which did only shadow that which Christ performed indeed . - John 4:24 By the word ( Spirit ) he meaneth the nature of the Godhead , and not the third person in the Trinity . - John 4:32 We may have care of our bodies , but yet so , that we prefer willingly and freely the occasion which is offered us to enlarge the kingdom of God , before all necessities of this life whatsoever . - John 4:35 When the spiritual corn is ripe , we must not linger : for so the children of this world would condemn us . - John 4:36 The doctrine of the Prophets was as it were a sowing time : and the doctrine of the Gospel , as the harvest , and there is an excellent agreement between them both , and the ministers of them both . - John 4:37 That proverb . - John 4:39 The Samaritans do most joyfully embrace that which the Jews most stubbornly rejected . - John 4:43 The despisers of Christ deprive themselves of his benefit : yet Christ prepareth a place for himself . - John 4:43 Into the towns and villages of Galilee : for he would not make abode in his country of Nazareth , because they despised him , and where ( as the other Evangelists write ) the efficacy of his benefits was hindered through their marvelous stiffneckedness . - John 4:46 Although Christ be absent in body , yet he worketh mightily in the believers by his word . - John 4:46 Some of Herod ’ s courtiers , for though Herod was not a king , but a Tetrarch , yet the lofty name only except , he was a king , or at least the people called him a king . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	John	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the Well , and he himself drank thereof , and his sons , and his cattle .
GNV	John	4	13	Jesus answered , and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water , shall thirst again :
GNV	John	4	14	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him , shall never be more athirst : but the water that I shall give him , shall be in him a well of water , springing up into everlasting life .
GNV	John	4	15	The woman said unto him , Sir , give me of that water , that I may not thirst , neither come hither to draw .
GNV	John	4	16	Jesus said unto her , Go , call thine husband , and come hither .
GNV	John	4	17	The woman answered , and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , thou hast well said , I have no husband .
GNV	John	4	18	For thou hast had five husbands , and he whom thou now hast , is not thine husband : that saidest thou truly .
GNV	John	4	19	The woman said unto him , Sir , I see that thou art a Prophet .
GNV	John	4	20	[ h ] Our fathers worshipped in this [ i ] mountain , and ye say , that in ( C ) Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
GNV	John	4	22	Ye worship that which ye ( D ) know not : we worship that which we know : for salvation is of the Jews .
GNV	John	4	23	But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in [ j ] Spirit and Truth : for the Father requireth even such to worship him .
GNV	John	4	24	( E ) God is a [ k ] Spirit , and they that worship him , must worship him in Spirit and Truth .
GNV	John	4	25	The woman said unto him , I know well that Messiah shall come , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
GNV	John	4	27	¶ And upon that , came his disciples , and marveled that he talked with a woman : yet no man said unto him , What askest thou ? or why talkest thou with her .
GNV	John	4	28	The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and said to the men ,
GNV	John	4	29	Come , see a man which hath told me all things that ever I did : is not he that Christ ?
GNV	John	4	30	Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
GNV	John	4	31	¶ In the meanwhile , the disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat .
GNV	John	4	33	Then said the disciples between themselves , Hath any man brought him meat ?
GNV	John	4	34	Jesus said unto them , My meat is that I may do the will of him that sent me , and finish his work .
GNV	John	4	35	[ m ] Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? Behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the regions : ( F ) for they are white already unto harvest .
GNV	John	4	36	[ n ] And he that reapeth , receiveth reward , and gathered fruit unto life eternal , that both he that soweth , and he that reapeth might rejoice together .
GNV	John	4	37	For herein is the [ o ] saying true , that one soweth and another reapeth .
GNV	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that , whereon ye bestowed no labor : other men labored , and ye are entered into their labors .
GNV	John	4	40	Then when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him , that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
GNV	John	4	41	And many more believed because of his own word .
GNV	John	4	42	And they said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed that Christ the Savior of the world .
GNV	John	4	43	¶ [ q ] So two days after he departed thence , and went into [ r ] Galilee .
GNV	John	4	44	For Jesus himself had ( G ) testified , that a Prophet hath none honor in his own country .
GNV	John	4	45	Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galileans received him , which had seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they went also to the feast .
GNV	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would go down , and heal his son : for he was even ready to die .
GNV	John	4	48	Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
GNV	John	4	49	The ruler said unto him , Sir , go down before my son dies .
GNV	John	4	50	Jesus said unto him , Go thy way , thy son liveth : and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and went his way .
GNV	John	4	51	And as he was now going down , his servants met him , saying , Thy son liveth .
GNV	John	4	52	Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him .
GNV	John	4	53	Then the father knew that it was the same hour in the which Jesus had said unto him , Thy son liveth . And he believed , and all his household .

GNV	John	5	2	[ a ] And there is at Jerusalem by the place of the sheep , a [ b ] pool called in Hebrew [ c ] Bethesda , having five porches :
GNV	John	5	10	[ d ] The Jews therefore said to him that was made whole , It is the Sabbath day : ( B ) it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
GNV	John	5	17	[ e ] But Jesus answered them , My father worketh hitherto , and I work .
GNV	John	5	19	Then answered Jesus , and said unto them , Verily , verily I say unto you , The Son can do nothing [ g ] of himself , save that he [ h ] seeth the Father do : for whatsoever things he doeth , the same things doeth the Son [ i ] in like manner .
GNV	John	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son , and showeth him all things , whatsoever he himself doeth , and he will show him greater works than these , that ye should marvel .
GNV	John	5	45	[ ab ] Do not think that I will accuse you to my Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
GNV	John	5	1	After ( A ) that , there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went to Jerusalem .
GNV	John	5	3	In the which lay a great multitude of sick folk , of blind , halt , and withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
GNV	John	5	4	For an Angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first , after the stirring of the water , stepped in , was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
GNV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he now long time had been diseased , he said unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
GNV	John	5	7	The sick man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
GNV	John	5	8	Jesus said unto him , Rise : take up thy bed , and walk .
GNV	John	5	9	And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and the same day was the Sabbath .
GNV	John	5	11	He answered them , He that made me whole he said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
GNV	John	5	12	Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ?
GNV	John	5	13	And he that was healed , knew not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away from the multitude that was in that place .
GNV	John	5	14	And after that , Jesus found him in the Temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
GNV	John	5	15	¶ The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus that had made him whole .
GNV	John	5	16	And therefore the Jews did persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the Sabbath day .
GNV	John	5	18	( C ) Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him : not only because he had broken the Sabbath : but said also that God was [ f ] his Father , and made himself equal with God .

GNV	John	5	23	Because that all men should honor the Son , as they honor the Father : he that honoreth not the Son , the same honoreth not the Father which hath sent him .

GNV	John	5	25	[ n ] Verily , verily I say unto you , the hour shall come , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear it shall live .
GNV	John	5	26	For as the Father hath life in himself , so likewise hath he given to the Son to have life in himself .

Not for that the Father doeth some things , and then the son worketh after him , and doeth the like , but because the might and power of the Father and the Son do work equally and jointly together . - John 5:21 The Father maketh no man partaker of everlasting life , but in Christ , in whom only also he is truly worshipped . - John 5:22 This word ( judgeth ) is taken by the figure Synecdoche , for all government . - John 5:22 These words are not so to be taken , as though they simply denied that God governeth the world , but as the Jews imagined it , which separate the Father from the Son , whereas indeed , the Father doth not govern the world but only in the person of his Son , being made manifest in the flesh : so saith he afterward , verse

GNV	John	6	5	( B ) [ b ] Then Jesus lift up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude came unto him , he said unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these might eat ?
GNV	John	6	15	[ c ] When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come , and take him to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
GNV	John	6	17	( C ) And entered into a ship , and went over the sea , [ e ] towards Capernaum : and now it was dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
GNV	John	6	19	And when they had rowed about five and twenty , or thirty furlongs , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near unto the ship : so they were afraid .
GNV	John	6	26	[ g ] Jesus answered them , and said , Verily , verily I say unto you , Ye seek me not , because ye saw the miracles , but because ye ate of the loaves , and were filled .
GNV	John	6	27	[ h ] Labor not for the meat which perisheth , but for the meat that endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath ( D ) God the Father [ i ] sealed .
GNV	John	6	35	And Jesus said unto them , I am that bread [ p ] of life : he that cometh to me , shall not hunger , and he that believeth in me , shall never thirst .
GNV	John	6	42	And they said , ( G ) Is not this Jesus that son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how then saith he , I came down from heaven ?
GNV	John	6	52	[ ac ] Then the Jews strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
GNV	John	6	60	[ ag ] Many therefore of his disciples ( when they heard this ) said , This is an hard saying : who can hear it ?
GNV	John	6	66	[ aj ] From that time , many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
GNV	John	6	69	And we believe and know that thou art that Christ that Son of the living God .
GNV	John	6	1	Cor .
GNV	John	6	2	And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles , which he did on them that were diseased .
GNV	John	6	3	Then Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
GNV	John	6	4	Now the Passover a ( A ) feast of the Jews was near .
GNV	John	6	7	Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that everyone of them may take a little .
GNV	John	6	8	Then said unto him one of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother ,
GNV	John	6	9	There is a little boy here , which hath five barley loaves , and two fishes : but what are they among so many ?
GNV	John	6	10	calleth Manna spiritual food , it maketh nothing against this place , for he joineth the thing signified with the sign : but in this whole disputation , Christ dealeth with the Jews after their own opinion and conceit of the matter , and they had no further consideration of the Manna , but in that it fed the belly . - John 6:35 Which have life , and give life . - John 6:37 The gift of faith proceedeth from the free election of the Father in Christ , after which followeth necessarily everlasting life : Therefore faith in Christ Jesus is a sure witness of our election , and therefore of our glorification , which is to come . - John 6:38 See John 5:22 . - John 6:40 Seeing and believing are joined together : for there is another kind of seeing , which is general , which the devils have , for they see : but here he speaketh of that kind of seeing , which is proper to the elect . - John 6:41 Flesh can not perceive spiritual things , and therefore the beginning of our salvation cometh from God , who changeth our nature , so that we being inspired of him , may abide to be instructed and saved by Christ . - John 6:45 In the book of the Prophets , for the old Testament was divided by them into three several parts , into the Law the Prophets , and the Holy writ . - John 6:45 To wit , they shall be children of the Church , for so the Prophet Isaiah expoundeth it , Isa . 54:13 , that is to say , ordained to life , Acts 13:48 , and therefore the knowledge of the heavenly truth , is the gift and work of God , and standeth not in any power of man . - John 6:46 If the son only hath seen the Father , then it is he only that can teach and instruct us truly . - John 6:48 The true use of Sacraments , is to ascend from them to the thing itself , that is to Christ : and by the partaking of whom only , we get everlasting life . - John 6:50 He pointed out himself when he spake these words . - John 6:51 Christ being sent from the Father , is the selfsame unto us for the getting and keeping of everlasting life , that bread and flesh , yea meat and drink are to the use of this transitory life . - John 6:51 Which giveth life to the world . - John 6:51 That is to say , whosoever is partaker of Christ indeed , who is our food . - John 6:52 Flesh can not put a difference between fleshly eating which is done by the help of the teeth , and spiritual eating which consisteth in faith , and therefore is condemneth that which it understandeth not : yet notwithstanding the truth must be preached and taught . - John 6:53 If Christ be present , life is present , but when Christ is absent , then is death present . - John 6:57 In that that Christ is man , he receiveth that power which quickeneth and giveth life to them that are his , of his Father : and he addeth this word ( That ) to make a difference between him and all other fathers . - John 6:57 Christ his meaning is , that though he be man , yet his flesh can give life , not of the own nature , but because that flesh of his liveth by the Father , that is to say , death suck and draw out of the Father , that power which it hath to give life . - John 6:60 The reason of man can not comprehend the uniting of Christ and his members : therefore let it worship and reverence that which is better than itself . - John 6:63 The flesh of Christ doth therefore quicken us , because that he that is man , is God : which mystery is only comprehended by faith , which is the gift of God , properly only to the elect . - John 6:63 Spirit , that is , that power which floweth from the Godhead , causeth the flesh of Christ , which otherwise were nothing but flesh , but to live in itself , and to give life to us . - John 6:66 Such is the malice of men , that they take occasion of their own destruction , even of the very doctrine of salvation ( unless it be a few , which believe through the singular gift of God . ) - John 6:70 The number of the professors , of Christ is very small , and among them also there be some hypocrites , and worse than all others .

GNV	John	6	11	And Jesus took the bread , and gave thanks , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down : and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
GNV	John	6	12	And when they were satisfied , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the broken meat which remaineth , that nothing be lost .
GNV	John	6	13	Then they gathered it together , and filled twelve baskets with the broken meat of the five barley loaves , which remained unto them that had eaten .
GNV	John	6	14	Then the men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world .
GNV	John	6	16	¶ [ d ] When even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
GNV	John	6	18	And the Sea arose with a great wind that blew .
GNV	John	6	20	But he said unto them , It is I : be not afraid .
GNV	John	6	21	Then [ f ] willingly they received him into the ship , and the ship was by and by at the land , whither they went .
GNV	John	6	22	¶ The day following , the people which stood on the other side of the sea , saw that there was none other ship there , save that one , where into his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples in the ship , but that his disciples were gone alone ,
GNV	John	6	23	And that there came other ships from Tiberias near unto the place where they ate the bread , after the Lord had given thanks .
GNV	John	6	24	Now when the people saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
GNV	John	6	25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
GNV	John	6	28	Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the [ j ] works of God ?
GNV	John	6	29	[ k ] Jesus answered , and said unto them , ( E ) [ l ] This is the work of God , that ye believe in him , whom he hath sent .
GNV	John	6	30	[ m ] They said therefore unto him , What sign showest thou then , that we may see it , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
GNV	John	6	31	Our fathers did eat Manna in the desert , as it is ( F ) written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
GNV	John	6	32	[ n ] Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily I say unto you , Moses gave you not [ o ] that bread from heaven , but my Father giveth you that true bread from heaven .
GNV	John	6	33	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
GNV	John	6	34	Then they said unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread .
GNV	John	6	36	But I said unto you , that ye also have seen me , and believe not .
GNV	John	6	37	[ q ] All that the Father giveth me , shall come to me : and him that cometh to me , I cast not away .
GNV	John	6	38	For I came down from heaven , not to do mine [ r ] own will , but his will which hath sent me .
GNV	John	6	39	And this is the Father ’ s will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me , I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
GNV	John	6	40	And this is the will of him that sent me , that every man which [ s ] seeth the Son , and believeth in him , should have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
GNV	John	6	41	[ t ] The Jews then murmured at him because he said , I am that bread , which is come down from heaven .
GNV	John	6	43	Jesus then answered , and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
GNV	John	6	44	No man can come to me , except the Father , which hath sent me , draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
GNV	John	6	45	It is written in the ( H ) [ u ] Prophets , And they shall be all [ v ] taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me :
GNV	John	6	46	( I ) Not that any man hath seen the Father , [ w ] save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
GNV	John	6	47	Verily , verily I say unto you , he that believeth in me , hath everlasting life .
GNV	John	6	48	[ x ] I am that bread of life .
GNV	John	6	49	( J ) Your fathers did eat Manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
GNV	John	6	50	[ y ] This is that bread , which cometh down from heaven , that he which eateth of it , should not die .
GNV	John	6	51	[ z ] I am that [ aa ] living bread , which came down from heaven : if any man [ ab ] eat of this bread , he shall live forever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
GNV	John	6	53	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have [ ad ] no life in you .
GNV	John	6	54	Whosoever ( K ) eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life , and I will raise him up at the last day .
GNV	John	6	55	For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
GNV	John	6	56	He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
GNV	John	6	57	As [ ae ] that living Father hath sent me , so live I by the [ af ] Father , and he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
GNV	John	6	58	This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers have eaten Manna , and are dead . He that eateth of this bread , shall live forever .
GNV	John	6	59	These things spake he in the Synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
GNV	John	6	61	But Jesus knowing in himself , that his disciples murmured at this , said unto them , Doth this offend you ?
GNV	John	6	62	What then if ye should see that Son of man ascend up ( L ) where he was before ?
GNV	John	6	63	[ ah ] It is the [ ai ] spirit that quickeneth : the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , are spirit and life .
GNV	John	6	64	But there are some of you that believe not : for Jesus knew from the beginning , which they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
GNV	John	6	65	And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it be given unto him of my Father .
GNV	John	6	67	Then said Jesus to the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
GNV	John	6	68	Then Simon Peter answered him , Master , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life :
GNV	John	6	70	[ ak ] Jesus answered them , Have not I ( M ) chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
GNV	John	6	71	Now he spake it of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , though he was one of the twelve . Footnotes - John 6:1 Not that he cut over the lake of Tiberias , but by reason of the large creeks , his sailing made his journey the shorter : therefore he is said to have gone over the sea , when as he passed over from one side of the creek to the other . - John 6:5 They that follow Christ do sometimes hunger , but they are never destitute of help . - John 6:15 Christ is not only not delighted , but also greatly offended with a preposterous worship . - John 6:16 The godly are often in peril and danger , but Christ cometh to them in time , even in the midst of the tempests , and bringeth them to the heaven . - John 6:17 In Mark 6:45 they are willed to go before to Bethsaida , for Bethsaida was in the way to Capernaum . - John 6:21 They were afraid at the first , but when they knew his voice , they became new men , and took him willingly into the ship , whom they had shunned and fled from before . - John 6:26 They that seek the kingdom of heaven lack nothing : notwithstanding the Gospel is not the food of the belly , but of the mind . - John 6:27 Bestow your labor and pain . - John 6:27 That is , whom God the Father hath distinguished from all other men by planting his own virtue in him , as though he had sealed him with his seal , that he might be a lively pattern and representer of him : and that more is , installed him to this office , to reconcile us men to God , and bring us to everlasting life , which is only proper to Christ . - John 6:28 Which please God : for they think that everlasting life hangeth upon the condition of fulfilling the Law : therefore Christ calleth them back to faith . - John 6:29 Men torment themselves in vain , when they go about to please God without faith . - John 6:29 That is , this is the work that God requireth , that you believe in me , and therefore he calleth them back to faith . - John 6:30 The spiritual virtue of Christ is contemned of them which are desirous of earthly miracles . - John 6:32 Christ , who is the true and only author and giver of eternal life , was signified unto the fathers , in Manna . - John 6:32 He denieth that Manna was that true heavenly bread , and saith that he himself is that true bread , because he feedeth unto the true and everlasting life .

GNV	John	7	2	; Isa .
GNV	John	7	10	[ e ] But as soon as his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were privily .
GNV	John	7	12	And much murmuring was there of him among the people . Some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay : but he deceiveth the people .
GNV	John	7	14	[ g ] Now when [ h ] half the feast was done , Jesus went up into the Temple , and taught .
GNV	John	7	32	[ u ] The Pharisees heard that the people murmured these things of him , and the Pharisees , and high Priests sent officers to take him .
GNV	John	7	41	Others said , This is that Christ : and some said , But shall that Christ come out of Galilee ?
GNV	John	7	47	Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceived ?
GNV	John	7	50	Nicodemus said unto them , ( ( N ) he that came to Jesus by night , and was one of them . )
GNV	John	7	1	After these things , Jesus walked in Galilee , and would not walk in Judea : for the Jews sought to kill him .
GNV	John	7	3	[ b ] His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judea , that thy disciples may see thy works that thou doest .
GNV	John	7	4	For there is no man that doeth anything secretly , and he himself seeketh to be famous . If thou doest these things , show thyself to the world .
GNV	John	7	5	For as yet his [ c ] brethren believed not in him .
GNV	John	7	6	[ d ] Then Jesus said unto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is always ready .
GNV	John	7	8	Go ye up unto this feast : I will not go up yet unto this feast : ( B ) for my time is not yet fulfilled .
GNV	John	7	9	¶ These things he said unto them , and abode still in Galilee .
GNV	John	7	11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
GNV	John	7	13	Howbeit no man spake [ f ] openly of him for fear of the Jews .
GNV	John	7	15	And the Jews marveled , saying , How knoweth this man the Scriptures , seeing that he never learned !
GNV	John	7	16	[ i ] Jesus answered them , and said , [ j ] My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
GNV	John	7	17	If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
GNV	John	7	18	[ k ] He that speaketh of himself , seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
GNV	John	7	19	( C ) [ l ] Did not Moses give you a Law , and yet none of you keepeth the Law ? ( D ) Why go ye about to kill me ?
GNV	John	7	20	The people answered , and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
GNV	John	7	21	[ m ] Jesus answered , and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
GNV	John	7	22	( E ) Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision , ( not because it is of Moses , but of the ( F ) fathers ) and ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man .
GNV	John	7	23	If a man on the Sabbath receive circumcision , that the [ n ] Law of Moses should not be broken , be ye angry with me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day ?
GNV	John	7	24	( G ) [ o ] Judge not [ p ] according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
GNV	John	7	25	¶ [ q ] Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he whom they go about to kill ?
GNV	John	7	26	And behold , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing to him : do the rulers know indeed that this is indeed that Christ ?
GNV	John	7	27	[ r ] Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when that Christ cometh , no man shall know whence he is .
GNV	John	7	28	¶ [ s ] Then cried Jesus in the Temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and know whence I am : yet am I not come of myself , but he that sent me , is true , whom ye know not .
GNV	John	7	29	But I know him : for I am of him , and he hath sent me .
GNV	John	7	30	[ t ] Then they sought to take him , but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
GNV	John	7	31	Now many of the people believed on him , and said , When that Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than this man hath done ?
GNV	John	7	33	Then said Jesus unto them , Yet am I a little while with you , and then go I unto him that sent me .
GNV	John	7	34	( H ) Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me , and where I am , can ye not come .
GNV	John	7	35	Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? Will he go unto them that are [ v ] dispersed among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
GNV	John	7	36	What saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me ? and where I am , can ye not come ?
GNV	John	7	37	[ w ] Now in the [ x ] last and ( I ) great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
GNV	John	7	38	He that believeth in me , ( J ) as saith the [ y ] Scripture , out of his belly shall flow rivers of water of life .
GNV	John	7	39	( ( K ) This spake he of the Spirit , which they that believed in him , should receive : for the [ z ] holy Ghost was not yet given , because that Jesus was not yet [ aa ] glorified . )
GNV	John	7	40	[ ab ] So many of the people , when they heard this saying , said , ( L ) Of a truth this is that Prophet :
GNV	John	7	42	( M ) Saith not the Scripture that that Christ shall come of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ?
GNV	John	7	43	So was there dissension among the people for him .
GNV	John	7	44	, but especially in Isa .
GNV	John	7	45	[ ac ] Then came the officers to the high Priests and Pharisees , and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ?
GNV	John	7	46	The officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
GNV	John	7	48	[ ad ] Doth any of the rulers , or of the Pharisees believe in him ?
GNV	John	7	49	But this people , which know not the Law , are cursed ,
GNV	John	7	51	Doth our Law judge a man before it hear him , ( O ) and know [ ae ] what he hath done ?
GNV	John	7	52	They answered , and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no Prophet .
GNV	John	7	53	[ af ] And every man went unto his own house . Footnotes - John 7:2 This feast was so called , because of the booths and tents which they pight of divers kinds of boughs , and sat under them seven days together ; all which time the feast lasted . - John 7:3 The grace of God cometh not by inheritance , but it is a gift that cometh other ways , whereby it cometh to pass , that oftentimes the children of God suffer more affliction by their own kinsfolk than by strangers . - John 7:5 His kinsfolk : for so use the Hebrews to speak . - John 7:6 We must not follow the foolish desires of our friends . - John 7:10 An example of horrible confusion in the very bosom of the Church . The Pastors oppress the people with terrors and fear : the people seek Christ , when he appeareth not : when he offereth himself , they neglect him . Some also that know him condemn him rashly : a very few think well of him , and that in secret . - John 7:13 Or , boldly and freely : for the chief of the Jews sought nothing so much , as to bury his fame and name . - John 7:14 Christ striveth with goodness against the wickedness of the world : in the mean season the most part of men take occasion of offense even by that fame , whereby they ought to have been stirred up to embrace Christ . - John 7:14 About the fourth day of the feast . - John 7:16 Therefore are there few to whom the Gospel favoreth well , because the study of godliness is very rare . - John 7:16 See John 5:22 , and he speaketh this after the opinion of the Jews , as if he said , My doctrine is not mine , that is , it is not his whom you take to be a man as others are , and therefore set light by him , but it is his that sent me . - John 7:18 The true doctrine of salvation differeth from the false in this , that the same setteth forth the glory of God , and this by puffing up of men darkeneth the glory of God . - John 7:19 None do more confidently boast themselves to be the defenders of the Law of God , than they that do most impudently break it . - John 7:21 The Sabbath day ( which is here set before us for a rule of all ceremonies ) was not appointed to hinder but to further and practice God ’ s works : amongst which the love of our neighbor is the chiefest . - John 7:23 That is to say , if the law of circumcision which Moses gave , be of so great accompt amongst you , that you doubt not to circumcise upon the Sabbath , do you rightly reprove me for healing a man thoroughly ? - John 7:24 We must judge according to the truth of things , lest the persons of men do turn us and carry us away . - John 7:24 By the show that I make : for I seem to be but an abject and rascal of Galilee , and a carpenter ’ s son , whom no man maketh account of : but mark the matter itself well , and judge the tree by the fruit . - John 7:25 Many do marvel that the endeavors of the enemies of God have no success : yet in the mean season they do not acknowledge the virtue and power of God . - John 7:27 Men are very wise to procure stops and stays to themselves . - John 7:28 The truth of Christ doth not hang upon the judgment of man . - John 7:30 The wicked can not do what they list , but what God hath appointed . - John 7:32 As the kingdom of God increaseth , so increaseth the rage of his enemies , till at length they in vain seek for those blessings absent , which they despised when they were present . - John 7:35 Word for word , ( to the dispersion of the Gentiles or Greeks ) and under the name of the Greeks he understandeth the Jews which were dispersed amongst the Gentiles . - John 7:37 There are two principles of our salvation : the one is to be thoroughly touched with a true feeling of our extreme poverty : the other to seek in Christ only ( whom we catch hold on by faith ) the abundance of all good things . - John 7:37 The last day of the feast of Tabernacles , that as , the eighth day , was as high a day , as the first . - John 7:38 This is not read word for word in any place , but it seemeth to be taken out of many places where mention is made of the gifts of the holy Ghost , as Joel
GNV	John	7	55	. - John 7:39 What is meant by the holy Ghost , he expressed a little before , speaking of the Spirit which they that believed in him should receive .

GNV	John	8	3	[ a ] Then the Scribes and the Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery , and set her in the midst ,
GNV	John	8	11	She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said , Neither do I condemn thee : go and sin no more .
GNV	John	8	12	[ d ] Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I ( C ) am that light of the world : he that followeth me , shall not walk in darkness , but shall have that light of life .
GNV	John	8	19	[ j ] Then said they unto him , Where is that Father of thine ? Jesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor the Father of mine . If ye had known me , ye should have known that Father of mine also .
GNV	John	8	39	They answered , and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus said unto them , If ye were Abraham ’ s children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
GNV	John	8	42	Therefore Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , then would ye love me : for I proceeded forth , and came from God , neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
GNV	John	8	44	( G ) Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do : he hath been a murderer from the [ x ] beginning , and [ y ] abode not in the [ z ] truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , then speaketh he of his [ aa ] own : for he is a liar , and the [ ab ] father thereof .
GNV	John	8	56	[ al ] Your father Abraham [ am ] rejoiced to see my [ an ] day , and he [ ao ] saw it , and was glad .
GNV	John	8	1	And Jesus went unto the mount of Olives ,
GNV	John	8	2	And early in the morning came again into the Temple , and all the people came unto him , and he sat down and taught them .
GNV	John	8	4	And said unto him , Master , we found this woman committing adultery even in the very act .
GNV	John	8	5	( A ) Now Moses in our Law commanded , that such should be stoned : what sayest thou therefore ?
GNV	John	8	6	And this they said to tempt him , that they might have , whereof to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground ,
GNV	John	8	7	[ b ] And while they continued asking him , he lifted himself up , and said unto them , ( B ) Let him that is among you without sin , cast the first stone at her .
GNV	John	8	9	And when they heard it , being accused by their own conscience , they went out , one by one , beginning at the eldest even to the last : so Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
GNV	John	8	10	[ c ] When Jesus had lifted up himself again , and saw no man , but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
GNV	John	8	13	[ e ] The Pharisees therefore said unto him , [ f ] Thou bearest record of thyself : thy record is not true .
GNV	John	8	14	( D ) Jesus answered , and said unto them , [ g ] Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know whence I come , and whither I go : but ye can not tell whence I came , and whither I go .
GNV	John	8	15	Ye judge after the flesh : I [ h ] judge no man .
GNV	John	8	16	And if I also judge , my judgment is true , for I am not alone , but I , and the Father , that sent me .
GNV	John	8	17	And it is also written in your Law , ( E ) that the testimony of two men is true .
GNV	John	8	18	[ i ] I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me .
GNV	John	8	20	These words spake Jesus in the [ k ] treasury , as he taught in the Temple , and no man laid hands on him : [ l ] for his hour was not yet come .
GNV	John	8	21	[ m ] Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins , Whither I go , can ye not come .
GNV	John	8	22	Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself , because he saith , Whither I go , can ye not come ?
GNV	John	8	23	And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath , I am from above : ye are of this world , I am not of this world .
GNV	John	8	24	I said therefore unto you , That ye shall die in your sins : for except ye believe , that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
GNV	John	8	25	[ n ] Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? And Jesus said unto them , Even [ o ] the same thing that I said unto you from the beginning .
GNV	John	8	26	[ p ] I have many things to say , and to judge of you : but he that sent me , is true , and the things that I have heard of him , those speak I to the world .
GNV	John	8	27	[ q ] They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
GNV	John	8	28	Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself , but as my Father hath taught me , so I spake these things .
GNV	John	8	29	For he that sent me , is with me : the Father hath not left me alone , because I do always those things that please him .
GNV	John	8	30	¶ As he spake these things , many believed in him .
GNV	John	8	31	[ r ] Then said Jesus to the Jews which believed in him , If ye continue in my word , ye are verily my disciples ,
GNV	John	8	32	And shall know the truth , and the truth shall [ s ] make you free .
GNV	John	8	33	[ t ] They answered him , We be [ u ] Abraham ’ s seed , and were never bond to any man : why sayest thou then , Ye shall be made free ?
GNV	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , Verily , verily I say unto you , that whosoever commiteth sin , is the ( F ) servant of sin .
GNV	John	8	35	And the servant abideth not in the house forever : but the Son abideth forever .
GNV	John	8	36	If that Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
GNV	John	8	37	[ v ] I know that ye are Abraham ’ s seed , but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
GNV	John	8	38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your Father .
GNV	John	8	40	But now ye go about to kill me , a man that have told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
GNV	John	8	41	Ye do the works of your father . Then said they to him , We are not born of fornication : we have one Father , which is God .
GNV	John	8	43	Why do ye not understand my [ w ] talk ? because ye can not hear my word .
GNV	John	8	45	And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
GNV	John	8	46	[ ac ] Which of you can rebuke me of sin ? and if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
GNV	John	8	47	( H ) He that is of God heareth God ’ s words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God .
GNV	John	8	48	[ ad ] Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ?
GNV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , I have not a devil , but I honor my Father , and ye have dishonored me .
GNV	John	8	50	And I seek not mine own praise : but there is one that [ ae ] seeketh it , and judgeth .
GNV	John	8	51	[ af ] Verily , verily I say unto you , If a man keep my word , he shall never [ ag ] see death .
GNV	John	8	52	[ ah ] Then said the Jews to him , Now know we that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the Prophets : and thou sayest , If a man keep my word , he shall never taste of death .
GNV	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the Prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
GNV	John	8	54	[ ai ] Jesus answered , If I honor myself , mine honor is [ aj ] nothing worth : it is my Father that honoreth me , whom ye say , that he is your God .
GNV	John	8	55	[ ak ] Yet ye have not known him : but I know him , and if I should say I know him not , I should be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his word .
GNV	John	8	57	Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
GNV	John	8	58	Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily I say unto you , before Abraham was , I [ ap ] am .
GNV	John	8	59	[ aq ] Then took they up stones to cast at him , but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the Temple : And he passed through the midst of them , and so went his way . Footnotes - John 8:3 While the wicked go about to make a snare for good men , they make a snare for themselves . - John 8:7 Against hypocrites which are very severe judges against other men , and flatter themselves in their own sins . - John 8:10 Christ would not take upon him the civil Magistrates office : he contented himself to bring sinners to faith and repentance . - John 8:12 The world which is blind in itself can not come to have ray light but in Christ only . - John 8:13 Christ is without all exception the best witness of the truth , for he was sent by his Father for that purpose , and was by him approved to the world by infinite miracles . - John 8:13 Thou bearest witness of thyself which thing by all men ’ s opinion , is naught : and for a man to commend himself is very discommendable . - John 8:14 That which he denied afore , John 5:31 , must be taken by a manner of granting , for in that place he framed himself somewhat to the humor of his hearers , which acknowledged nothing in Christ but his humanity , and therefore he was content they should set light by his own witness , unless it were otherwise confirmed . But in this place he standeth for the maintenance of his Godhead , and praiseth his Father , who is his witness , and agreeth with him . - John 8:15 I do now only teach you , I condemn no man : but yet if I list to do it , I might lawfully do it , for I am not alone , but my Father is with me . - John 8:18 The Godhead is plainly distinguished from the manhood , else there were not two witnesses : for the party accused is not taken for a witness . - John 8:19 No man can know God , but in Christ only . - John 8:20 This was some place appointed for the gathering of the offerings . - John 8:20 We live and die at the pleasure of God and not of men : Therefore this one thing remaineth that we go forward constantly in our vocation . - John 8:21 Because that men do naturally abhor heavenly things , no man can be a fit disciple of Christ , unless the Spirit of God frame him : in the mean season notwithstanding , the world must of necessity perish , because it refuseth the life that is offered unto it . - John 8:25 He shall at length know who Christ is , which will diligently hear , what he saith . - John 8:25 That is , I am Christ , and the savior , for so I told you from the beginning that I was . - John 8:26 God is the revenger of Christ ’ s doctrine despised . - John 8:27 Even the contempt of Christ maketh for his glory : which thing his enemies shall feel at length to their great smart . - John 8:31 The true disciples of Christ continue in his doctrine , that profiting more and more in the knowledge of the truth , they may be delivered from the most grievous burden of sin , into the true liberty of righteousness and life . - John 8:32 From the slavery of sin . - John 8:33 Some of the multitude , not they that believed : for this is not the speech of men that consent unto him but of men that are against him . - John 8:33 Born and begotten of Abraham . - John 8:37 Our wicked manners declare , that we are plainly born of a devilish nature , But we are changed , and made of the household of God , according to the covenant which he made with Abraham by Christ only , apprehended and laid hold on by faith : which faith is known by a godly and honest life . - John 8:43 Or , language : as though he said , you do no more understand what I say , than if I spake in a strange and unknown language to you . - John 8:44 From the beginning of the world : for as soon as man was made , the devil cast him headlong into death . - John 8:44 That is , continued not constantly , or remained not . - John 8:44 That is , in faithfulness , and uprightness , that is , kept not his creation . - John 8:44 Even of his own head , and of his own brain or disposition . - John 8:44 The author thereof . - John 8:46 Christ did thoroughly execute the office , that his Father enjoined him . - John 8:48 The enemies of Christ make their bravery for a while , but the Father will appear at his time to revenge the reproach that is done unto him in the person of his son . - John 8:50 That is , that will revenge both your despising of me , and of him . - John 8:51 The only doctrine of the Gospel apprehended by faith , is a sure remedy against death . - John 8:51 That is , he shall not feel it : for even in the midst of death , the faithful see life . - John 8:52 Against them which abuse the glory of the Saints , to darken Christ ’ s glory . - John 8:54 There is nothing farther off from all ambition than Christ , but his Father hath set him above all things . - John 8:54 This is spoken by manner of [ a grant ] : as if he had said , Be it so , let this report which I give of myself , be of no force : yet there is another that glorifieth me , that is , that honoreth my Name . - John 8:55 There is no right knowledge of God , without Christ , neither any right knowledge of Christ without his word . - John 8:56 The virtue of Christ showed itself through all former ages in the Fathers , for they saw in the promises , that he should come , and did very joyfully lay hold on him with a lively faith . - John 8:56 Was very desirous . - John 8:56 A day is a space that a man liveth in , or doeth any notable act , or suffereth any great thing . - John 8:56 With the eyes of faith , Heb . 11:13 . - John 8:58 Christ as he was God , was before Abraham : and he was the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world . - John 8:59 Zeal without knowledge , breaketh out at length into a most open madness : and yet the wicked can not do what they list .

GNV	John	9	1	Sam . 6:5 . - John 9:24 He is called a sinner in the Hebrew tongue , which is a wicked man , and maketh as it were an art of sins . - John 9:28 Proud wickedness must needs at length break forth , which in vain lieth hid under a zeal of godliness . - John 9:34 Thou art naught even from the cradle , and as we use to say , there is nothing in thee but sin . - John 9:35 Most happy is their state , which are cast furthest out of the Church of the wicked ( which proudly boast themselves of the name of the Church ) that Christ may come never to them . - John 9:39 Christ doth lighten all them by the preaching of the Gospel , which acknowledge their own darkness , but such as seem to themselves to see clearly enough , those he altogether blindeth : of which sort are they oftentimes , which have the highest place in the Church . - John 9:39 With great power and authority , to do what is righteous and just : as if he said , These men take upon them to govern the people of God after their own lusts , as though they saw all things , and no man but they : but I will rule far otherwise than these men do : for whom they account for blind men , them I will lighten , and such as take themselves to be wisest , them will I drown in most gross darkness of ignorance . - John 9:39 In these words ( of seeing and not seeing ) there is a secret taunting and check to the Pharisees : for they thought all men blind but themselves . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	John	9	13	¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that was once blind .
GNV	John	9	22	These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had ordained already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be excommunicated out of the Synagogue .
GNV	John	9	35	[ m ] Jesus heard that they had cast him out : and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe in the Son of God ?
GNV	John	9	36	He answered , and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe in him ?
GNV	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
GNV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , [ b ] Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents , but that the works of God should be showed on him .
GNV	John	9	4	[ c ] I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is [ d ] day : the night cometh when no man can work .
GNV	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , ( A ) I am the light of the world .
GNV	John	9	6	[ e ] As soon as he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and anointed the eyes of the blind with the clay ,
GNV	John	9	7	And said unto him , Go wash in the pool of Siloam ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore and washed , and came again seeing .
GNV	John	9	8	[ f ] Now the neighbors and they that had seen him before , when he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
GNV	John	9	10	Therefore they said unto him , How were thine eyes [ g ] opened ?
GNV	John	9	11	He answered , and said , The man that is called Jesus , made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and received sight .
GNV	John	9	12	Then they said unto him , Where is he ? He said , I can not tell .
GNV	John	9	14	And it was the Sabbath day , when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
GNV	John	9	15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him , how he had received sight . And he said unto them , He laid clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
GNV	John	9	16	[ h ] Then said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the Sabbath day . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner , do such miracles ? and there was a dissension among them .
GNV	John	9	17	Then spake they unto the blind again , What sayest thou of him , because he hath opened thine eyes ? And he said , He is a Prophet .
GNV	John	9	18	Then the Jews did not believe him ( that he had been blind , and received his sight ) until they had called the parents of him that had received sight .
GNV	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying , Is this your son , whom ye say was born blind ? How doth he now see then ?
GNV	John	9	20	His parents answered them , and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
GNV	John	9	21	But by what means he now seeth , we know not : or who hath opened his eyes , can we not tell : he is old enough : ask him : he shall answer for himself .
GNV	John	9	23	Therefore said his parents , He is old enough : ask him .
GNV	John	9	24	Then again called they the man that had been blind , and said unto him , [ i ] Give glory unto God : we know that this man is a [ j ] sinner .
GNV	John	9	25	Then he answered , and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I can not tell : one thing I know , that I was blind , and now I see .
GNV	John	9	26	Then said they to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
GNV	John	9	27	He answered them , I have told you already , and ye have not heard it : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
GNV	John	9	28	[ k ] Then reviled they him , and said , Be thou his disciple : we be Moses ’ disciples .
GNV	John	9	29	We know that God spake with Moses : but this man we know not from whence he is .
GNV	John	9	30	The man answered , and said unto them , Doubtless , this is a marvelous thing , that ye know not whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
GNV	John	9	31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him heareth he .
GNV	John	9	32	Since the world began , was it not heard , that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
GNV	John	9	33	If this man were not of God , he could have done nothing .
GNV	John	9	34	They answered , and said unto him , [ l ] Thou art altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? so they cast him out .
GNV	John	9	37	And Jesus said unto him , Both thou hast seen him , and he it is that talketh with thee .
GNV	John	9	38	Then he said , Lord , I believe , and worshipped him .
GNV	John	9	39	[ n ] And Jesus said , I am come unto [ o ] judgment into this world , that they [ p ] which see not , might see : and that they ( B ) which see , might be made blind .
GNV	John	9	40	And some of the Pharisees which were with him , heard these things , and said unto him , Are we blind also ?
GNV	John	9	41	Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should not have sin : but now ye say , We see : therefore your sin remaineth . Footnotes - John 9:1 Sin is the beginning even of all bodily diseases , and yet doth it not follow , that God always respecteth their sins , whom he most sharply punisheth . - John 9:3 Christ reasoneth here , as his disciples thought , which presuppose that there come no diseases but for sins only : whereupon he answereth that there was another cause of this man ’ s blindness , and that was , that God ’ s his work might be seen . - John 9:4 The works of Christ are as it were a light , which lighten the darkness of the world . - John 9:4 By ( day ) is meant the light , that is , the lightsome , doctrine of the heavenly truth : and by ( night ) is meant the darkness which cometh by the obscurity of the same doctrine . - John 9:6 Christ healing the man born blind , by taking the sign of clay , and afterward the sign of the fountain of Siloam ( which signifieth Sent ) showeth that as he at the beginning made man , so doth he again restore both his body and soul : and yet so , that he himself cometh first of his own accord to heal us . - John 9:8 A true image of all men , who as they are of nature blind , do neither themselves receive the light that is offered unto them , nor suffer it in others , and yet make a great ado amongst themselves . - John 9:10 This is an Hebrew kind of speech , for they call a man ’ s eyes shut , when they can not receive any light : And therefore they are said to have their eyes opened , which of blind men are made to see . - John 9:16 Religion is not assaulted by any means more than by pretence of Religion : but the more it is pressed down , the more it riseth up . - John 9:24 A solemn order , whereby men were constrained in old time to acknowledge their fault before God , as if they should say , Consider thou art before God , who knoweth the whole matter , and therefore see thou reverence his majesty , and do him this honor , rather to confess the whole matter openly , than to lie before him , Josh . 7:19 ;

GNV	John	10	8	[ d ] All that [ e ] ever came before me , are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
GNV	John	10	11	( A ) I am that good shepherd : that good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep .
GNV	John	10	14	I am that good shepherd , and know mine , and am known of mine .
GNV	John	10	19	¶ [ m ] Then there was a dissension again among the Jews for these sayings .
GNV	John	10	31	( E ) [ s ] Then the Jews again took up stones , to stone him .
GNV	John	10	39	[ v ] Again they went about to take him : but he escaped out of their hands ,
GNV	John	10	2	But he that goeth in by the door , is the shepherd of the sheep .
GNV	John	10	3	To him the [ b ] porter openeth , and the sheep hear his voice , and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
GNV	John	10	4	And when he hath sent forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
GNV	John	10	5	And they will not follow a stranger , but they flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
GNV	John	10	6	This [ c ] parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
GNV	John	10	7	Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily I say unto you , I am that door of the sheep .
GNV	John	10	9	[ f ] I am that door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall [ g ] go in , and go out , and find pasture .
GNV	John	10	12	But an hireling , and he which is not the shepherd , neither the sheep are his own , seeth the wolf coming , and he leaveth the sheep , and fleeth , and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
GNV	John	10	13	So the hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
GNV	John	10	15	As the Father [ h ] knoweth me , so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for my sheep .
GNV	John	10	16	[ i ] Other sheep I have also , which are not of this fold : them also must I bring , and they shall hear my voice : and ( B ) there shall be [ j ] one sheepfold , and one shepherd .
GNV	John	10	17	[ k ] Therefore doth my Father love me , because ( C ) [ l ] I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
GNV	John	10	18	No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself : I have power to lay it down , and have power to take it again : this ( D ) commandment have I received of my Father .
GNV	John	10	20	And many of them said , He hath a devil , and is mad : why hear ye him ?
GNV	John	10	21	Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil : can the devil open the eyes of the blind ?
GNV	John	10	22	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the [ n ] Dedication , and it was winter .
GNV	John	10	23	[ o ] And Jesus walked in the Temple , in Solomon ’ s porch .
GNV	John	10	24	Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou be that Christ , tell us plainly .
GNV	John	10	25	[ p ] Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believe not : the works that I do in my Father ’ s Name , they bear witness of me .
GNV	John	10	26	[ q ] But ye believe not : [ r ] for ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
GNV	John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me ,

GNV	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , Many good works have I showed you from my [ t ] Father : for which of these works do ye stone me ?
GNV	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , saying , For the good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy , and that thou being a man , makest thyself God .
GNV	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your Law , ( F ) I said , Ye are gods ?
GNV	John	10	35	If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God was given , and the Scripture can not be [ u ] broken ,
GNV	John	10	36	Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest , because I said , I am the Son of God ?
GNV	John	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
GNV	John	10	38	But if I do , then though ye believe not me , yet believe the works , that ye may know and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
GNV	John	10	40	And went again beyond Jordan , into the place where John first baptized , and there abode .
GNV	John	10	41	And many resorted unto him , and said , John did no miracle : but all things that John spake of this man , were true .
GNV	John	10	42	And many believed in him there . Footnotes - John 10:1 Seeing that by Christ only we have access to the Father , there are neither other true shepherds , than those which come to Christ themselves , and bring others thither also , neither is any to be thought the true sheepfold , but that which is gathered to Christ . - John 10:3 In those days they used to have a servant always sitting at the door , and therefore he speaketh after the manner of those days . - John 10:6 This word ( parable ) which the Evangelist useth here , signifieth a dark kind of speech , when words are taken from their natural meaning , to signify another thing to us . - John 10:8 It maketh no matter , how many , neither how old the false teachers there have been . - John 10:8 These large terms must be applied to the matter he speaketh of . And therefore when he calleth himself the door , he calleth all them thieves and robbers which take upon them this name of Door , which none of the Prophets can , for they showed the sheep , that Christ was the door . - John 10:9 Only Christ is the true Pastor , and that only is the true Church , which acknowledgeth him to be properly their only Pastor : To him are opposite thieves which feed not the sheep , but kill them : and hirelings also , which forsake the flock in time of danger , because they feed it only for their own profit and gains . - John 10:9 That is , shall live safely : so use the Jews to speak , as Deut . 26:6 , and yet there is a peculiar alluding to the shepherd ’ s office . - John 10:15 Loveth me , alloweth me . - John 10:16 The calling of the Gentiles . - John 10:16 The certain mark of the Catholic Church throughout all the world , which hath one head , that is Christ , the only keeper and only shepherd of it . - John 10:17 Christ is by the decree of the Father , the only true shepherd of the true Church , for he willingly gave his life for his sheep , and by his own power rose again to life . - John 10:17 He speaketh in the time that now is because Christ ’ s whole life was as it were a perpetual death . - John 10:19 The Gospel discovereth hypocrisy , and therefore the world must needs rage when it cometh forth . - John 10:22 The feast of the Dedication was instituted by Judas Maccabeus and his brethren , after the restoring of God ’ s true religion , by the casting out of Antiochus his garrison ,

GNV	John	11	1	And [ a ] a certain man was sick , named Lazarus of Bethany , the [ b ] town of Mary , and her sister Martha .
GNV	John	11	25	Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection and the life : ( D ) he that believeth in me , though he were dead yet shall he live .
GNV	John	11	14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
GNV	John	11	17	¶ Then came Jesus , and found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
GNV	John	11	34	And said , Where have ye laid him ? They said unto him , Lord , come and see .
GNV	John	11	43	As he had spoken these things , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
GNV	John	11	47	Then gathered the high Priests , and the Pharisees a [ m ] council , and said , What shall we do ? For this man doeth many miracles .
GNV	John	11	49	[ o ] Then one of them named Caiaphas , which was the high Priest that same year , said unto them , Ye perceive nothing at all ,
GNV	John	11	50	( F ) Nor yet do you consider that it is expedient for us , that one man die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
GNV	John	11	56	Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the Temple , What think ye , that he cometh not to the feast ?
GNV	John	11	57	Now both the high Priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that if any man knew where he were , he should show it , that they might take him . Footnotes - John 11:1 Christ in restoring the stinking carcass of his friend to life , showeth an example both of his mighty power , and also of his singular good will toward men : which is also an image of the resurrection to come . - John 11:1 Where his sisters dwelt . - John 11:4 That is to say , sent for the purpose to kill him . - John 11:6 In that , that God seemeth sometimes to linger in helping of us , he doeth it both for his glory , and for our salvation , as the falling out of the matter in the end , plainly proveth . - John 11:8 This only is the sure and right way to life , to follow God boldly without fear , who calleth us and shineth before us in the darkness of this world . - John 11:9 All things are fitly wrought and brought to pass in their season . - John 11:11 The Jews used a milder kind of speech , and called death a sleep , whereupon in other languages the place of burial where the dead are laid , waiting for the resurrection , is called a sleeping place . - John 11:19 God who is the maker of nature , doth not condemn natural affections , but showeth that they ought to be examined by the rule of faith . - John 11:23 That is , shall recover life again . - John 11:33 Christ took upon him together with our flesh all affections of man ( sin only excepted ) and amongst them especially mercy and compassion . - John 11:33 These are tokens that he was greatly moved , but yet they were without sin : and these affections are proper to man ’ s nature . - John 11:46 The last point of hard and iron-like stubbornness is this , to proclaim open war against God , and yet ceaseth not to make a presence both of godliness and of the profit of the commonwealth . - John 11:47 The Jews called the council Sanhedrin : and the word that John useth is Synedri . - John 11:48 That is , take away from us by force : for at that time , though the high Priest ’ s authority was greatly lessened and decayed , yet there was some kind of government left among the Jews . - John 11:49 The raging and mad company of the false Church , persuade themselves that they can not be in safety , unless he is taken away , who only upholdeth the Church : And so likewise judgeth the wisdom of the flesh in worldly affairs , which is governed by the spirit of giddiness or madness . - John 11:51 Christ doth sometimes so turn the tongues , even of the wicked , that in cursing , they bless . - John 11:52 For they were not gathered together in one country , as the Jews were , but to be gathered from all quarters , from the East to the West . - John 11:54 We may give place to the rage of the wicked , when it is expedient so to do , but yet in such sort , that we swerve not from God ’ s vocation .

GNV	John	11	2	( And it was that ( A ) Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
GNV	John	11	3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest , is sick .
GNV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard it , he said , This sickness is not unto [ c ] death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
GNV	John	11	5	¶ Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister , and Lazarus .
GNV	John	11	6	[ d ] And after he had heard that he was sick , yet abode he two days still in the same place where he was .
GNV	John	11	7	Then after that , said he to his disciples , Let us go into Judea again .
GNV	John	11	8	[ e ] The disciples said unto him , Master , the Jews lately sought to ( B ) stone thee , and dost thou go thither again ?
GNV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , Are there not [ f ] twelve hours in the day ? If a man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
GNV	John	11	10	But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
GNV	John	11	12	Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall be safe .
GNV	John	11	13	Howbeit , Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of the natural sleep .
GNV	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes , that I was not there , that ye may believe : but let us go unto him .
GNV	John	11	16	Then said Thomas ( which is called Didymus ) unto his fellow disciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
GNV	John	11	18	( Now Bethany was near unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off . )
GNV	John	11	19	[ h ] And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary to comfort them for their brother .
GNV	John	11	20	Then Martha , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went to meet him : but Mary sat still in the house .
GNV	John	11	21	Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not been dead .
GNV	John	11	22	But now I know also , that whatsoever thou askest of God , God will give it thee .
GNV	John	11	23	Jesus said unto her , Thy brother shall [ i ] rise again .
GNV	John	11	24	Martha said unto him , I know that he shall rise again ( C ) in the resurrection at the last day .
GNV	John	11	26	And whosoever liveth , and believeth in me , shall never die : Believest thou this ?
GNV	John	11	27	She said unto him , Yea , Lord , I believe that thou art that Christ that Son of God , which should come into the world .
GNV	John	11	28	¶ And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
GNV	John	11	29	And when she heard it , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
GNV	John	11	30	For Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in the place where Martha met him .
GNV	John	11	31	The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily , and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave , to weep there .
GNV	John	11	32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not been dead .
GNV	John	11	33	[ j ] When Jesus therefore saw her weep , and the Jews also weep which came with her , he [ k ] groaned in the spirit , and was troubled in himself ,
GNV	John	11	35	And Jesus wept .
GNV	John	11	36	Then said the Jews , behold , how he loved him .
GNV	John	11	37	And some of them said , ( E ) Could not he which opened the eyes of the blind , have made also , that this man should not have died ?
GNV	John	11	38	Jesus therefore again groaned in himself , and came to the grave . And it was a cave , and a stone was laid upon it .
GNV	John	11	39	Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha the sister of him that was dead , said unto him , Lord , he stinketh already for he hath been dead four days .
GNV	John	11	40	Jesus said unto her , Said I not unto thee , that if thou didst believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
GNV	John	11	41	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee , because thou hast heard me .
GNV	John	11	42	I know that thou hearest me always , but because of the people that stand by , I said it , that they may believe , that thou hast sent me .
GNV	John	11	44	Then he that was dead , came forth , bound hand and foot with bands , and his face was bound with a napkin . Jesus said unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
GNV	John	11	45	¶ Then many of the Jews , which came to Mary , and had seen the things , which Jesus did , believed in him .
GNV	John	11	46	[ l ] But some of them went their way to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
GNV	John	11	48	If we let him thus alone , all men will believe in him , and the Romans will come and [ n ] take away both our place , and the nation .
GNV	John	11	51	[ p ] This spake he not of himself : but being high Priest that same year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation :
GNV	John	11	52	And not for that nation only , but that he should gather together in one the children of God , which [ q ] were scattered .
GNV	John	11	53	Then from that day forth they consulted together , to put him to death .
GNV	John	11	54	[ r ] Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews , but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
GNV	John	11	55	¶ And the Jews ’ Passover was at hand , and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover , to purify themselves .
GNV	John	12	12	¶ ( C ) On the morrow a great multitude that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus should come to Jerusalem ,

GNV	John	12	2	There they made him a supper , and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
GNV	John	12	3	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of Spikenard very costly , and anointed Jesus ’ feet , and wiped his feet with her hair , and the house was filled with the savor of the ointment .
GNV	John	12	5	[ a ] Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
GNV	John	12	7	[ b ] Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying she kept it .
GNV	John	12	10	The high Priests therefore consulted , that they might put Lazarus to death also ,
GNV	John	12	18	Therefore met him the people also , because they heard that he had done this miracle .
GNV	John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
GNV	John	12	42	[ r ] Nevertheless , even among the chief rulers , many believed in him : but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be cast out of the Synagogue .
GNV	John	12	44	[ s ] And Jesus cried , and said , He that believeth in me , believeth [ t ] not in me , but in him that sent me .
GNV	John	12	1	Then ( A ) Jesus , six days before the Passover , came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , who died , whom he had raised from the dead .
GNV	John	12	4	Then said one of his disciples , even Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , which should betray him :
GNV	John	12	6	Now he said thus , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and ( B ) had the bag , and bore that which was given .
GNV	John	12	8	For the poor always ye have with you , but me ye shall not have always .
GNV	John	12	9	[ c ] Then much people of the Jews knew that he was there : and they came , not for Jesus ’ sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
GNV	John	12	11	because that for his sake many of the Jews went away , and believed in Jesus .
GNV	John	12	13	Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna , Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the Name of the Lord .
GNV	John	12	14	And Jesus found a young ass , and sat thereon , as it is written ,
GNV	John	12	15	( D ) Fear not , daughter of Zion : behold , thy King cometh sitting on an ass ’ s colt .
GNV	John	12	16	But his disciples understood not these things at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they , that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
GNV	John	12	17	The people therefore that was with him , bare witness that he called Lazarus out of the grave and raised him from the dead .
GNV	John	12	19	[ d ] And the Pharisees said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? Behold , the world goeth after him .
GNV	John	12	20	¶ Now there were certain Greeks among them that [ e ] came up to worship at the feast .
GNV	John	12	21	And they came to Philip , which was of Bethsaida in Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see that Jesus .
GNV	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man must be glorified .
GNV	John	12	24	[ f ] Verily , verily I say unto you , Except the wheat corn fall into the ground and [ g ] die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
GNV	John	12	25	( E ) He that loveth his life , shall lose it , and he that hateth his life in this world , shall keep it unto life eternal .
GNV	John	12	26	( F ) If any man serve me , let him follow me : for where I am , there shall my servant be : and if any man serve me , him will my father honor .
GNV	John	12	27	[ h ] Now is my soul troubled : and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this [ i ] hour : but therefore came I unto this hour .
GNV	John	12	28	Father , [ j ] glorify thy Name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
GNV	John	12	29	Then said the people that stood by , and heard , that it was a thunder : others said , An Angel spake to him .
GNV	John	12	30	[ k ] Jesus answered , and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
GNV	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
GNV	John	12	32	( G ) And I , if I were [ l ] lift up from the earth , will draw [ m ] all men unto me .
GNV	John	12	33	Now this said he , signifying what death he should die .
GNV	John	12	34	The people answered him , We have heard out of the ( H ) Law , that that Christ bideth forever : and how sayest thou , that that Son of man must be lift up ? Who is that Son of man ?
GNV	John	12	35	[ n ] Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is ( I ) the light with you : walk while ye have that light , lest the darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in the dark , knoweth not whither he goeth .
GNV	John	12	36	While ye have that light , believe in that light , that ye may be the [ o ] children of the light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and hid himself from them .
GNV	John	12	37	¶ [ p ] And though he had done so many miracles before them , yet believed they not on him ,
GNV	John	12	38	That the saying of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled , that he said , ( J ) Lord , who believed our report ? and to whom is the [ q ] arm of the Lord revealed ?
GNV	John	12	39	Therefore could they not believe , because that Isaiah saith again ,
GNV	John	12	40	( K ) He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart , that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
GNV	John	12	41	These things said Isaiah when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
GNV	John	12	43	( L ) For they loved the praise of men , more than the praise of God .
GNV	John	12	45	And he that seeth me , seeth him that sent me .
GNV	John	12	46	I ( M ) am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth in me , should not abide in darkness .
GNV	John	12	47	( N ) And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
GNV	John	12	48	He that refuseth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : ( O ) the word that I have spoken , it shall judge him in the last day .
GNV	John	12	49	For I have not spoken of myself : but the father which sent me , he gave me a commandment what I should say , and what I should speak .
GNV	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : the things therefore that I speak , I speak them so as the Father said unto me . Footnotes - John 12:5 An horrible example in Judas of a mind blinded with covetousness , and yet pretending godliness . - John 12:7 This Extraordinary anointing , which was for a sign , is so allowed of God , that he witnesseth how he will not be worshipped with outward pomp , or costly service , but with alms . - John 12:9 When the light of the Gospel showeth itself , some are found to be curious , and others ( which left ought ) to be open enemies : others in a rage honor him , whom they will straightway fall from : and very few do so reverently receive him as they ought : Notwithstanding Christ beginneth his spiritual kingdom in the midst of his enemies . - John 12:19 Even they which go about to oppress Christ , are made instruments of his glory . - John 12:20 After the solemn custom : the Greeks were first so called by the name of the country of Greece , where they dwelt : but afterward , all that were not of the Jew ’ s religion , but worshipped false gods , and were also called Heathens , were called by this name . - John 12:24 The death of Christ is as it were a sowing , which seemeth to be a dying to the corn , but indeed is the cause of a far greater harvest : and such as is the condition of the head , so shall it be of the members . - John 12:24 A wheat corn dieth when it is changed by virtue of the ground , and becometh a root of a fruitful blade . - John 12:27 Whilst Christ went about to suffer all the punishment which is due to our sins , and whilst his divinity did not yet show his might and power so far as this satisfaction might thoroughly wrought , now when he is stricken with the great fear of the curse of God , he crieth out and prayeth , and desireth to be released : yet notwithstanding he preferreth the will and glory of his Father before all things , whose obedience the Father alloweth even from heaven . - John 12:27 To wit , of death that is now at hand . - John 12:28 So then the Father ’ s glory is Christ ’ s glory . - John 12:30 Christ foretelleth to the deaf , the manner of his death , the overcoming of the devil and the world , and in conclusion his triumph . - John 12:32 Christ used a word , which hath a double meaning : for it signifieth either to lift up , or to rid out of the way , for his meaning was to put them in mind of his death , but the Jews seem to take it another way . - John 12:32 Chrysostom and Theophylact refer this word , All , to all nations : that is , not to the Jews only . - John 12:35 Unmeasurable is the mercy of God , but an horrible judgment followed , if it be contemned . - John 12:36 That is , partakers of light . - John 12:37 Faith is not of nature , but of grace . - John 12:38 The arm of the Lord , is the Gospel , which is the power of God to salvation to all that believe : And therefore the arm of the Lord is not revealed to them , whose hearts the Lord hath not opened . - John 12:42 Such as believe , are not only few in number , if they be compared with the unbelievers , but also the most of those few ( yea and that especially the chiefest ) do fear men more than God . - John 12:44 The sum of the Gospel , and therefore of salvation , which Christ witnessed in the midst of Jerusalem , by his crying out , is this : to rest upon Christ through faith , as the only Savior appointed and given us of the Father . - John 12:44 This word Not , doth not take any whit of this from Christ which is here spoken of , but is in way of correction rather , as if he said , He that believeth in me , doth not so much believe in me , as in him that sent me . So is it in Mark 9:37 . Geneva Bible ,

GNV	John	13	4	He [ d ] riseth from Supper , and layeth aside his upper garments , and took a towel , and girded himself .
GNV	John	13	14	If I then your Lord , and Master , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
GNV	John	13	21	When Jesus had said these things , he was troubled in the Spirit , and [ h ] testified , and said , Verily , verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
GNV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it : and he wet a sop , and gave it to Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son .
GNV	John	13	34	( H ) A new commandment give I unto you , that ye love one another : as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
GNV	John	13	37	Peter said unto him , Lord , why can I not follow thee now ? ( I ) I will lay down my life for thy sake .
GNV	John	13	38	Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou have denied me thrice . Footnotes - John 13:1 Christ no less certain of the victory , than of the combat which was at hand , using the sign of washing the feet , doth partly thereby give an example of singular modesty , and his great love toward his Apostles in this notable act , being like very shortly to depart from them : and partly witnesseth unto them , that it is he only which washeth away the filth of his people , and that by little and little , in their time and season . - John 13:1 Them of his household , that is , his Saints . - John 13:3 Into his power . - John 13:4 In that he is said to rise , it argueth that there was a space between the ceremonies of the Passover , and this washing of feet , at what time it seemeth that the Supper was instituted . - John 13:8 Unless thou suffer me to wash thee , thou shalt have no part in the kingdom of heaven . - John 13:16 The word signifieth an Apostle which is anyone that is sent from another . - John 13:18 The betraying of Christ was not casual , or a thing that happened by chance , but the Father so ordained the cause of our salvation , to reconcile us unto himself in his Son , and the Son did willingly and voluntarily obey the Father . - John 13:21 He affirmed it openly , and sealed it . - John 13:23 John ’ s leaning was such , that sitting down in his bed , his head was toward Jesus ’ head : so that it was an easy matter for him to touch Jesus ’ bosom : for it is certain that in old time men used not to sit at the table , but to lie down : on the one side . - John 13:31 We have to consider the glorifying of Christ in his ignominy . - John 13:31 This verse and the next following , are a most plain and evident testimony of the divinity of Christ . - John 13:33 The eternal glory shall flow by little and little from the head into the members . But in the meantime , we must take good heed that we pass over the race of this life in brotherly love . - John 13:36 An heavy example of rash trust and confidence . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	John	13	1	Now ( A ) [ a ] before the feast of the Passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come , that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , forasmuch as he loved his [ b ] own which were in the world , unto the end he loved them .
GNV	John	13	2	And when supper was done ( and that the devil had now put in the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , to betray him . )
GNV	John	13	3	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his [ c ] hands , and that he was come forth from God , and went to God ,
GNV	John	13	5	After that , he poured water into a basin , and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , and to wipe them with the towel , wherewith he was girded .
GNV	John	13	6	Then came he to Simon Peter , who said to him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
GNV	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do , thou knowest not now : but thou shalt know it hereafter .
GNV	John	13	8	Peter said unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou shalt have [ e ] no part with me .
GNV	John	13	9	Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also the hands and the head .
GNV	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , He that is washed , needeth not , save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are ( B ) clean , but not all .
GNV	John	13	11	For he knew who should betray him : therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
GNV	John	13	12	¶ So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
GNV	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that ye should do , even as I have done to you .
GNV	John	13	16	Verily , verily I say unto you , ( C ) The servant is not greater than his master , neither the [ f ] ambassador greater than he that sent him .
GNV	John	13	17	If ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them .
GNV	John	13	18	¶ [ g ] I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but it is that the Scripture might be fulfilled , ( D ) He that eateth bread with me , hath lift up his heel against me .
GNV	John	13	19	From henceforth tell I you before it come , that when it is come to pass , ye might believe that I am he .
GNV	John	13	20	( E ) Verily , verily I say unto you , If I send any , he that receiveth him , receiveth me , and he that receiveth me , receiveth him that sent me .
GNV	John	13	22	( F ) Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
GNV	John	13	23	Now there was one of his disciples , which [ i ] leaned on Jesus ’ bosom , whom Jesus loved .
GNV	John	13	24	To him beckoned therefore Simon Peter , that he should ask who it was of whom he spake .
GNV	John	13	25	He then as he leaned on Jesus ’ breast , said unto him , Lord , who is it ?
GNV	John	13	27	And after the sop , Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly .
GNV	John	13	28	But none of them that were at table , knew , for what cause he spake it unto him .
GNV	John	13	29	For some of them thought because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast : or that he should give something to the poor .
GNV	John	13	30	As soon then as he had received the sop , he went immediately out , and it was night .
GNV	John	13	31	¶ [ j ] When he was gone out , Jesus said , [ k ] Now is the son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
GNV	John	13	32	If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
GNV	John	13	33	[ l ] Little children , yet a little while am I with you : ye shall seek me , but as I said unto the ( G ) Jews , Whither I go , can ye not come : also to you say I now .
GNV	John	13	35	By this shall all men know , that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
GNV	John	13	36	[ m ] Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now : but thou shalt follow me afterward .
GNV	John	14	14	If ye shall ask anything in my Name , I will do it .

GNV	John	14	2	In my Father ’ s house are many dwelling places : if it were not so , [ b ] I would have told you : I go to [ c ] prepare a place for you .
GNV	John	14	7	[ h ] If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
GNV	John	14	16	And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you forever ,
GNV	John	14	17	Even the [ m ] Spirit of truth , whom the [ n ] world can not receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him : for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
GNV	John	14	26	( B ) But the Comforter , which is the holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my Name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , which I have told you .
GNV	John	14	27	[ s ] Peace I leave with you : my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , nor fear .
GNV	John	14	1	Let [ a ] not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me .
GNV	John	14	3	[ d ] And if I go to prepare a place for you , I will [ e ] come again , and receive you unto myself , that where I am , there may ye be also .
GNV	John	14	4	[ f ] And whither I go , ye know , and the way ye know .
GNV	John	14	5	Thomas said unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest : how can we then know the way ?
GNV	John	14	6	Jesus said unto him , I am [ g ] that Way , and that Truth , and that Life . No man cometh unto the Father , but by me .
GNV	John	14	8	Philip said unto him , Lord , show us thy Father , and it sufficeth us .
GNV	John	14	9	Jesus said unto him , I have been so long time with you , and hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me , hath seen my Father : how then sayest thou , Show us thy Father ?
GNV	John	14	10	[ i ] Believest thou not , that I am in the Father , and the Father is in me ? The words that I speak unto you , I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
GNV	John	14	11	Believe me , that I am in the Father , and the Father is in me : at the least , believe me for the very works ’ sake .
GNV	John	14	12	[ j ] Verily , verily I say unto you , he that believeth in me , the works that I do , he shall do also , and [ k ] greater than these shall he do : for I go unto my Father .
GNV	John	14	13	( A ) And whatsoever ye ask in my Name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
GNV	John	14	15	[ l ] If ye love me , keep my commandments .
GNV	John	14	18	I will not leave you fatherless : but I will come to you .
GNV	John	14	19	Yet a little while , and the world shall see me no more , but ye shall see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
GNV	John	14	20	At that day shall ye know that I am [ o ] in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
GNV	John	14	21	He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them : is he that loveth me : and he that loveth me , shall be loved of my Father : and I will love him , and will [ p ] show mine own self to him .
GNV	John	14	22	[ q ] Judas said unto him , ( not Iscariot ) Lord , what is the cause that thou wilt show thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
GNV	John	14	23	Jesus answered , and said unto him , If any man love me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and will dwell with him .
GNV	John	14	24	He that loveth me not , keepeth not my words , and the word which ye hear , is not mine , but the Father ’ s which sent me .
GNV	John	14	25	[ r ] These things have I spoken unto you , being present with you .
GNV	John	14	28	[ t ] Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and will come unto you . If ye loved me , ye would verily rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for the Father [ u ] is greater than I .
GNV	John	14	29	And now have I spoken unto you , before it come , that when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
GNV	John	14	30	[ v ] Hereafter will I not speak many things unto you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath [ w ] nought in me ,
GNV	John	14	31	But it is that the world may know that I love my Father : and as the Father hath commanded me , so I do . Arise , let us go hence . Footnotes - John 14:1 He believeth in God that believeth in Christ , and there is no other way to confirm our minds in greatest distresses . - John 14:2 That is , if it were not so as I tell you , to wit , unless there were place enough not only for me , but for you also in my father ’ s house , I would not thus deceive you with a vain hope , but I would have told you so plainly . - John 14:2 All the speech is by way of an allegory , whereby the Lord comforteth his own , declaring unto them his departure into heaven , which is , not to reign there alone , but to go before , and prepare a place for them . - John 14:3 Christ went not away from us : to the end to forsake us , but rather that he might at length take us up with him into heaven . - John 14:3 These words are to be referred to the whole Church , and therefore the Angels said to the disciples when they were astonished , What stand you gazing up into heaven ? This Jesus shall so come as you saw him go up , Acts 1:11 , and in all places of the Scripture , the full comfort of the Church is referred to that day when God shall be all in all , and is therefore called the day of redemption . - John 14:4 Christ only is the way to true and everlasting life , for he it is in whom the Father hath revealed himself . - John 14:6 This saying showeth unto us both the nature , the will and office of Christ . - John 14:7 It is plain by this place , that to know God , and to see God , is all one : Now whereas he said before , that no man saw God at any time , that it is to be understood thus , without Christ : or were it not through Christ , no man could ever see , nor saw God at any time : for as Chrysostom saith , the Son is a very short and easy setting forth of the father ’ s nature unto us . - John 14:10 The majesty of God showeth itself most evidently , both in Christ ’ s doctrine and deeds . - John 14:12 The approving of the virtue of Christ is not included within his own person , but it is spread through the body of his whole Church . - John 14:12 That is , not I only do them , but I can also give other men power to do greater . - John 14:15 He loveth Christ aright , which obeyeth his commandments : and because the same is accompanied with an infinite sort of miseries , although he be absent in body , yet doth he comfort his with the present virtue of the holy Ghost , whom the world despiseth , because it knoweth him not . - John 14:17 The holy Ghost is called the Spirit of truth , of the effect which he worketh , because he inspireth the truth into us , whereas otherwise he hath truth in himself . - John 14:17 Worldly men . - John 14:20 The Son is in the Father after such sort , that he is of one selfsame substance with the Father , but he is in his disciples in a certain respect as an aider and helper of them . - John 14:21 I will show myself to him , and be known of him , as if he saw me with his eyes : but this showing of himself is not bodily , but spiritually , yet so plain as none can be more . - John 14:22 We must not ask why the Gospel is revealed to some rather than to others , but we must rather take heed , that we embrace Christ who is offered unto us , and that we truly love him , that is to say , that we give ourselves wholly to his obedience . - John 14:25 It is the office of the holy Ghost to imprint in the midst of the elect in their times and seasons , that which Christ once spake . - John 14:27 All true felicity cometh to us by Christ alone . - John 14:28 So far is it , that we should be sorry for the departing of Christ , from us according to the flesh , that we should rather rejoice for it , seeing that all the blessing of the members dependeth upon the glorifying of the head . - John 14:28 This is spoken in that , that he is Mediator , for so the Father is greater than he , inasmuch as the person to whom request is made , is greater than he that maketh the request . - John 14:30 Christ goeth to death not unwillingly , but willingly , not as yielding to the devil , but obeying his Father ’ s decree . - John 14:30 As who would say , Satan will by and by set upon me with all the might he can , but he hath no power over me , neither shall he find any such thing in me as he thinketh he shall .

GNV	John	15	1	I [ a ] am that true vine , and my Father is that husbandman .
GNV	John	15	2	( A ) Every branch that beareth not fruit in me , he taketh away : and everyone that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
GNV	John	15	5	I am that vine : ye are the branches : he that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me can ye do nothing .
GNV	John	15	6	( C ) If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and withereth : and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they burn .
GNV	John	15	12	( E ) This is my commandment , that ye love one another , as I have loved you .
GNV	John	15	17	These things command I you , that ye love one another .
GNV	John	15	18	[ i ] If the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before you .
GNV	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said unto you , ( G ) The servant is not greater than his master . ( H ) If they have persecuted me , they will persecute you also : if they have kept my word , they will also keep yours .
GNV	John	15	3	( B ) Now are ye clean through the word , which I have spoken unto you .
GNV	John	15	4	Abide in me , and I in you : as the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine , no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
GNV	John	15	7	( D ) [ b ] If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask what ye will , and it shall be done to you .
GNV	John	15	8	[ c ] Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit , and be made my disciples .
GNV	John	15	9	[ d ] As the father hath loved me , so have I loved you : [ e ] continue in that my love .
GNV	John	15	10	If ye shall keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love , as I have kept my Father ’ s commandments , and abide in his love .
GNV	John	15	11	These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
GNV	John	15	13	Greater love than this hath no man , when any man bestoweth his life for his friends .
GNV	John	15	14	Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
GNV	John	15	16	[ g ] Ye [ h ] have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , ( F ) that ye go and bring forth fruits , and that your fruit remain , that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my Name , he may give it you .
GNV	John	15	19	If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
GNV	John	15	21	[ j ] But ( I ) all these things will they do unto you for my Name ’ s sake , because they have not known him that sent me .
GNV	John	15	22	[ k ] If I had not come and spoken unto them , they should not have had sin : but now have they no cloak for their sin .
GNV	John	15	23	He that hateth me , hateth my Father also .
GNV	John	15	24	If I had not done works among them which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen , and have hated both me , and my Father .
GNV	John	15	25	But it is that the word might be fulfilled , that is written in their [ l ] Law , ( J ) They hated me without a cause .
GNV	John	15	26	[ m ] But when that Comforter shall come , ( K ) whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth of the Father , he shall testify of me .
GNV	John	15	27	And ye shall witness also , because ye have been with me from the beginning . Footnotes - John 15:1 We are of nature dry and fit for nothing but the fire : Therefore that we may live and be fruitful , we must first be grafted into Christ , as it were into a vine by the Father ’ s hand : and then be daily shred with a continual meditation of the word and the cross ; otherwise it shall not avail any man at all to have been grafted , unless he cleave fast unto the vine , and so draw juice out of it . - John 15:7 He abideth in Christ , which resteth in his doctrine , and therefore bringeth forth good fruit : And the Father will deny such an one nothing . - John 15:8 As who would say , Herein shall my Father be glorified , and herein also shall you be my disciples , if you bring forth much fruit . - John 15:9 The love of the Father towards the Son , and of the Son towards us , and ours towards God and our neighbor , are joined together with an inseparable knot : and there is nothing more sweet and pleasant than it is . Now this love showeth itself by its effects : a most perfect example whereof , Christ himself exhibited unto us . - John 15:9 That is , in that love , wherewith I love you : which love is on both parts . - John 15:15 The doctrine of the Gospel ( as it is uttered by Christ ’ s own mouth ) is a most perfect and absolute declaration of the counsel of God , which pertaineth to our salvation , and is committed unto the Apostles . - John 15:16 Christ is the author and preserver of the ministry of the Gospel , even to the world ’ s end , but the ministers have above all things need of prayer and brotherly love . - John 15:16 This place teacheth us plainly , that our salvation cometh from the only favor and gracious goodness of the everlasting God towards us , and of nothing that we do or can deserve . - John 15:18 It ought not only not to fear , but rather confirm the faithful ministers of Christ , when they shall be hated of the world as their Master was . - John 15:21 The hatred that the world beareth against Christ , proceedeth of the blockishness of the mind , which notwithstanding is voluntary blind , so that the world can pretend no excuse to cover their fault . - John 15:22 As who would say , If I had not come , these men would not have stuck to have said still before God ’ s judgment seat , that they are religious , and void of sin : but seeing I came to them , and they clean refuse me , they can have no cloak for their wickedness . - John 15:25 Sometime by this word , Law , are meant the five books of Moses , but in this place , the whole Scripture : for the place alleged is in the Psalms . - John 15:26 Against the rage of the wicked , we shall stand surely by the inward testimony of the holy Ghost : But the holy Ghost speaketh no otherwise , than he spake by the mouth of the Apostles .

GNV	John	16	1	These [ a ] things have I said unto you , that ye should not be offended .
GNV	John	16	7	[ b ] Yet I tell you the truth , It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , that Comforter will not come unto you : but if I depart , I will send him unto you ,
GNV	John	16	21	A woman when she travaileth hath sorrow because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
GNV	John	16	2	Cor . 10:12 . - John 16:12 The doctrine of the Apostles proceeded from the holy Ghost , and is most perfect . - John 16:14 The holy Ghost bringeth no new doctrine , but teacheth that which was uttered by Christ ’ s own mouth , and imprinteth it in our minds . - John 16:16 The grace of the holy Ghost is a most lively glass , wherein Christ is truly beholden with the most sharpsighted eyes of faith , and not with the bleared eyes of the flesh : whereby we feel a continual joy even in the midst of sorrows . - John 16:16 When a little time is once past . - John 16:16 For I pass to eternal glory , so that I shall be much more present with you , than I was before : for then you shall feel indeed what I am , and what I am able to do . - John 16:25 The holy Ghost which was poured upon the Apostles after the Ascension of Christ , instructed both them in all chiefest mysteries and secrets of our salvation , and also by them the Church , and will also instruct it to the end of the world . - John 16:26 The sum of the worship of God , is the invocation of the Father in the Name of the Son the Mediator , who is already heard for us , for whom he hath abased himself , and is now also glorified . - John 16:29 Faith and foolish security differ very much . - John 16:32 Neither the wickedness of the world , neither the weakness of his own can diminish anything of the virtue of Christ . - John 16:33 The surety and stay of the Church dependeth only upon the victory of Christ . - John 16:33 That in me you might be thoroughly quieted . For by ( peace ) is meant in this place , that quiet state of mind , which is clean contrary to disquietness and heaviness . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	John	16	3	And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
GNV	John	16	4	( A ) But these things have I told you , that when the hour shall come , ye might remember , that I told you them . And these things said I not unto you from the beginning , because I was with you .
GNV	John	16	5	But now I go my way to him that sent me , and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
GNV	John	16	6	But because I have said these things unto you , your hearts are full of sorrow .
GNV	John	16	8	[ c ] And when he is come , he will [ d ] reprove the [ e ] world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment .
GNV	John	16	9	Of sin , because they believed not in me :
GNV	John	16	10	Of [ f ] righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye shall see me no more .
GNV	John	16	11	Of [ g ] judgment , [ h ] because the prince of this world is judged .
GNV	John	16	12	[ i ] I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
GNV	John	16	13	Howbeit , when he is come which is the spirit of truth , he will lead you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself , but whatsoever he shall hear , shall he speak , and he will show you the things to come .
GNV	John	16	14	[ j ] He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall show it unto you .
GNV	John	16	15	All things that the Father hath , are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and show it unto you .
GNV	John	16	17	Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me , and , For I go to the Father .
GNV	John	16	18	They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we know not what he saith .
GNV	John	16	19	Now Jesus knew that they would ask him , and said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves , of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
GNV	John	16	20	Verily , verily I say unto you , that ye shall weep and lament , and the world shall rejoice , and ye shall sorrow , but your sorrow shall be turned to joy .
GNV	John	16	22	And ye now therefore are in sorrow : but I will see you again , and your hearts shall rejoice , and your joy shall no man take from you .
GNV	John	16	23	And in that day shall ye ask me nothing . ( B ) Verily , verily I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my Name , he will give it you .
GNV	John	16	24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my Name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
GNV	John	16	25	[ n ] These things have I spoken unto you in parables : but the time will come , when I shall no more speak to you in parables : but I shall show you plainly of the Father .
GNV	John	16	26	[ o ] At that day shall ye ask in my Name , and I say not unto you , that I will pray unto the Father for you :
GNV	John	16	27	For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , ( C ) and have believed that I came out from God .
GNV	John	16	28	I am come out from the Father , and came into the world : again I leave the world , and go to the Father .
GNV	John	16	29	[ p ] His disciples said unto him , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and thou speakest no parable .
GNV	John	16	30	Now know we that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee . By this we believe , that thou art come out from God .
GNV	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , Do you believe now ?
GNV	John	16	32	( D ) [ q ] Behold , the hour cometh , and is already come , that ye shall be scattered every man into his own , and shall leave me alone : But I am not alone : for the Father is with me .
GNV	John	16	33	[ r ] These things have I spoken unto you , that [ s ] in me ye might have peace : in the world ye shall have affliction , but be of good comfort : I have overcome the world . Footnotes - John 16:1 The ministers of the Gospel must look for all manner of reproaches , not only of them which are open enemies , but even of them also which seem to be of the same household , and the very pillars of the Church . - John 16:7 The absence of Christ , according to the flesh , is profitable to the Church , that we may wholly depend upon his spiritual power . - John 16:8 The Spirit of God worketh so mightily by the preaching of the word , that he constraineth the world , will it , nill it , to confess its own unrighteousness , and Christ ’ s righteousness and almightiness . - John 16:8 He will so reprove the world , that the worldlings shall be able to present no excuse . - John 16:8 He respecteth the time that followed his ascension , when as all gainsayers were manifestly reproved through the pouring out of the holy Ghost upon the Church : So that the very enemies of Christ were reproved of sin , in that they were constrained to confess that they were deceived , in that they believed not , and therefore they said to Peter , Acts

GNV	John	17	1	Tim . 1:17 . - John 17:6 First of all he prayeth for those his disciples , by whom he would have the rest to be gathered together , commendeth them unto the Father , ( having once rejected the whole company of the reprobate ) because he received them of him into his custody , and for that they embracing his doctrine , shall have so many and so mighty enemies , that there is no way for them to be in safety , but by his help only . - John 17:6 He showeth hereby that everlasting election and choice , which was hidden in the good will and pleasure of God , which is the groundwork of our salvation . - John 17:6 He showeth how the everlasting and hidden purpose of God is declared in Christ , by whom we are justified and sanctified , if we lay hold of him by faith , that at length we may come to the glory of the election . - John 17:11 He prayeth that his people may peaceably agree and be joined together in one , that as the Godhead is one , so they may be of one mind and one consent together . - John 17:15 He showeth what manner of deliverance he meaneth : not that they should be in no danger , but that they being preserved from all , might prove by experience that the doctrine of salvation is true , which they received at his mouth to deliver to others . - John 17:17 That is , make them holy : and that is said to be holy , which is dedicated and made proper to God only . - John 17:18 He addeth moreover , that the Apostles have a vocation common with him , and therefore that they must be holden up by the selfsame virtue to give up themselves wholly to God , whereby he being first , did consecrate himself to the Father . - John 17:19 The true and substantial sanctification of Christ , is set against the outward purifyings . - John 17:20 Secondarily he offereth to God the Father , all his , that is , how many soever shall believe in him by the doctrine of the Apostles : that as he cleaveth unto the Father receiving from him all fullness , so they being joined with him , may receive life from him , and at length being together beloved in him , may also with him enjoy everlasting glory . - John 17:26 He communicateth with his by little and little , the knowledge of the Father , which is most full in Christ the Mediator , that they may in him be beloved of the Father , with the selfsame love wherewith he loveth the Son .

GNV	John	17	9	I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me : for they are thine .
GNV	John	17	20	[ m ] I pray not for these alone , but for them also which shall believe in me , through their word ,
GNV	John	17	2	( A ) As thou hast given him power over [ c ] all flesh , that he should give eternal life to all them that thou hast given him .
GNV	John	17	3	And this is life eternal , that they know thee to be the [ d ] only very God , and whom thou hast sent , Jesus Christ .
GNV	John	17	4	I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
GNV	John	17	5	And now glorify me , thou Father , with thine own self , with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
GNV	John	17	6	[ e ] I have declared thy Name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : [ f ] thine they were , and thou [ g ] gavest them me , and they have kept thy word .
GNV	John	17	7	( B ) Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me , are of thee .
GNV	John	17	8	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me , and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and have believed that thou hast sent me .
GNV	John	17	10	And all mine are thine , and thine are mine , and I am glorified in them .
GNV	John	17	11	And now am I no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy Name , even them whom thou hast given me , that they may be [ h ] one as we are .
GNV	John	17	12	While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy Name : those that thou gavest me , have I kept , and none of them is lost , but the child of perdition , that the ( C ) Scripture might be fulfilled .
GNV	John	17	13	And now come I to thee , and these things speak I in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
GNV	John	17	14	I have given them thy word , and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world .
GNV	John	17	15	[ i ] I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou keep them from evil .
GNV	John	17	16	They are not of the world , as I am not of the world .
GNV	John	17	18	[ k ] As thou didst send me into the world , so have I sent them into the world .
GNV	John	17	19	And for their sakes sanctify I myself , that they also may be sanctified through the [ l ] truth .
GNV	John	17	21	That they all may be one , as thou , O Father , art in me , and I in thee : even that they may be also one in us , that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .

GNV	John	17	23	I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one , and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them as thou hast loved me .
GNV	John	17	24	( D ) Father , I will that they which thou hast given me , be with me even where I am , that they may behold that my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
GNV	John	17	25	O righteous Father , the world also hath not known thee , but I have known thee , and these have known , that thou hast sent me .
GNV	John	17	26	[ n ] And I have declared unto them thy Name , and will declare it , that the love wherewith thou hast loved me , may be in them , and I in them . Footnotes - John 17:1 Jesus Christ the everlasting high Priest being ready straightway to offer up himself , doth by solemn prayers consecrate himself to God the Father as a sacrifice : and us together with himself . Therefore this prayer was from the beginning , is , and shall be to the end of the world , the foundation and ground of the Church of God . - John 17:1 He first declareth , that as he came into the world to the end that the Father might show in him , being apprehended by faith , his glory in saving his elect , so he applied himself to that only : and therefore desireth of the Father , that he would bless the work which he hath finished . - John 17:2 Over all men . - John 17:3 He calleth the Father the only very God , to set him against all false gods , and not to shut out himself and the holy Ghost , For straightway he joineth the knowledge of the Father and the knowledge of himself together , and according to his accustomed manner , setteth forth the whole Godhead in the person of the father : So is the Father alone said to be King , immortal , wise , and dwelling in the light which no man can attain unto , invisible , Rom . 16:17 ;

GNV	John	18	6	As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went away backwards , and fell to the ground .
GNV	John	18	13	[ f ] And led him away to ( D ) Annas first ( for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas , which was the high Priest that same year . )
GNV	John	18	22	When he had spoken these things , one of the officers which stood by , smote Jesus with his rod , saying , Answerest thou the high Priest so ?
GNV	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , If I have evil spoken , bear witness of the evil : but if I have well spoken , why smitest thou me ?
GNV	John	18	28	( I ) [ j ] Then led they Jesus from [ k ] Caiaphas into the common hall . Now it was morning , and they themselves went not into the common hall , lest they should be ( J ) defiled , but that they might eat the Passover .
GNV	John	18	36	[ n ] Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , my servants would surely fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
GNV	John	18	1	When [ a ] Jesus had spoken these things , he went forth with his disciples over the brook ( A ) Kidron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
GNV	John	18	2	And Judas which betrayed him knew also the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
GNV	John	18	3	( B ) [ b ] Judas then , after he had received a band of men and officers of the high Priests , and of the Pharisees , came thither with lanterns and torches , and weapons .
GNV	John	18	4	[ c ] Then Jesus , knowing all things that should come unto him , went forth and said unto them , Whom seek ye ?
GNV	John	18	5	They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus said unto them , I am he . Now Judas also which betrayed him , stood with them .
GNV	John	18	7	Then he asked them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
GNV	John	18	8	[ d ] Jesus answered , I said unto you , that I am he : therefore if ye seek me , let these go their way .
GNV	John	18	9	This was that the word might be fulfilled which he spake , ( C ) Of them which thou gavest me , have I lost none .
GNV	John	18	10	[ e ] Then Simon Peter having a sword , drew it , and smote the high Priest ’ s servant , and cut off his right ear . Now the servants name was Malchus .
GNV	John	18	11	Then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : shall I not drink of the cup which my Father hath given me ?
GNV	John	18	12	Then the band and the captain , and the officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him .
GNV	John	18	14	( E ) And Caiaphas was he , that gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
GNV	John	18	15	¶ ( F ) [ g ] Now Simon Peter followed Jesus , and another disciple , and that disciple was known of the high Priest : therefore he went in with Jesus into the hall of the high Priest .
GNV	John	18	16	But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out the other disciple which was known unto the high Priest , and spake to her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
GNV	John	18	17	Then said the maid that kept the door , unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man ’ s disciples ? He said , I am not .
GNV	John	18	19	¶ ( [ h ] The high Priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine ,
GNV	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world : I ever taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple , whither the Jews resort continually , and in secret have I said nothing .
GNV	John	18	21	Why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me what I said unto them : behold , they know what I said .
GNV	John	18	24	¶ ( G ) Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high Priest . )
GNV	John	18	25	( H ) [ i ] And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself , and they said unto him , Art not thou also of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not .
GNV	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high Priest , his cousin whose ear Peter smote off , said , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
GNV	John	18	27	Peter then denied again , and immediately the cock crew .
GNV	John	18	29	Pilate then went out unto them , and said , What accusation bring ye against this man ?
GNV	John	18	30	They answered , and said unto him , If he were not an evil doer , we would not have delivered him unto thee .
GNV	John	18	31	Then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him after your own Law . Then the Jews said unto him , [ l ] It is not lawful for us to put any man to death .
GNV	John	18	32	It was that the word of Jesus ( K ) might be fulfilled which he spake , [ m ] signifying what death he should die .
GNV	John	18	33	( L ) So Pilate entered into the common hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the king of the Jews ?
GNV	John	18	34	Jesus answered him , Sayest thou that of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
GNV	John	18	35	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation , and the high Priest have delivered thee unto me . What hast thou done ?
GNV	John	18	37	Pilate then said unto him , Art thou a King then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a King : for this cause am I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth : everyone that is of the truth , heareth my voice .
GNV	John	18	38	[ o ] Pilate said unto him , [ p ] What is truth ? And when he had said that , he went out again unto the Jews , and said unto them , I find in him no cause at all .
GNV	John	18	39	( M ) But you have a custom that I should deliver you one loose at the Passover : will ye then that I loose unto you the King of the Jews ?
GNV	John	18	40	( N ) Then [ q ] cried they all again , saying , Not him , but Barabbas : now this Barabbas was a murderer . Footnotes - John 18:1 Christ goeth of his own accord into a garden , which his betrayer knew , to be taken : that by his obedience he might take away the sin that entered into the world by one man ’ s rebellion , and that in a garden . - John 18:3 Christ , who was innocent , was taken as a wicked person , that we which are wicked might be let go as innocent . - John 18:4 Christ ’ s person ( but not his virtue ) was bound of the adversaries , when and how he would . - John 18:8 Christ doth not neglect the office of a good pastor , no not in his greatest danger . - John 18:10 We ought to contain the zeal we bear to God , within the bounds of our vocation . - John 18:13 Christ is brought before an earthly high Priest to be condemned for our blasphemies , that we might be acquitted of the everlasting high Priest himself . - John 18:15 A lively example of the fragility of man even in the best , when they be once left to themselves . - John 18:19 Christ defendeth his cause but slenderly , not that he would withdraw himself from death , but to show that he was condemned as an innocent . - John 18:25 After that men have once fallen , they can not only not lift themselves by their own strength , but also they fall more and more into worse , until they be raised up again , by a new virtue of God . - John 18:28 The Son of God is brought before the judgment seat of an earthly and profane man , in whom there is found much less wickedness , than in the princes of the people of God : A lively image of the wrath of God against sin , and therewithal of his great mercy , and least of all , of his most severe judgment against the stubborn contemners of his grace when it is offered unto them . - John 18:28 From Caiaphas ’ s house . - John 18:31 For judgments of life and death were taken from them forty years before the destruction of the temple . - John 18:32 For Christ had foretold that he should be crucified . - John 18:36 Christ avoucheth his spiritual kingdom , but rejecteth a worldly . - John 18:38 It was requisite that Christ should be pronounced innocent , but notwithstanding ( in that that he took upon him our person ) was to be condemned as a most wicked man . - John 18:38 He speaketh this disdainfully and scoffingly , and not by way of asking a question . - John 18:40 Word for word , made a great and foul voice .

GNV	John	19	2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple garment ,
GNV	John	19	4	[ b ] Then Pilate went forth again , and said unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know , that I find no fault in him at all .
GNV	John	19	8	¶ [ d ] When Pilate then heard that word , he was the more afraid ,
GNV	John	19	16	[ g ] Then delivered he him unto them , to be crucified . ( B ) And they took Jesus , and led him away .
GNV	John	19	26	And when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he said unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son .
GNV	John	19	30	Now when Jesus had received of the vinegar , he said , It is finished , and bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
GNV	John	19	34	[ n ] But one of the soldiers with a spear [ o ] pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
GNV	John	19	40	Then took they the body of Jesus , and wrapped it in linen clothes with the odors , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
GNV	John	19	1	Then ( A ) Pilate took Jesus and [ a ] scourged him .
GNV	John	19	3	And said , Hail King of the Jews . And they smote him with their rods .
GNV	John	19	5	Then came Jesus forth wearing a crown of thorns , and a purple garment . And Pilate said unto them , Behold the man .
GNV	John	19	6	Then when the high Priests and officers saw him , they cried , saying , [ c ] Crucify , crucify him . Pilate said unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
GNV	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
GNV	John	19	9	And went again into the common hall , and said unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him none answer .
GNV	John	19	10	Then said Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to loose thee ?
GNV	John	19	11	Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee , hath the greater sin .
GNV	John	19	12	From thenceforth Pilate sought to loose him , but the Jews cried , saying , If thou deliver him , thou art not Caesar ’ s friend : for whosoever maketh himself a King , speaketh against Caesar .
GNV	John	19	13	¶ [ e ] When Pilate heard this word , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called the pavement , and in Hebrew , [ f ] Gabbatha .
GNV	John	19	14	And it was the Preparation of the Passover , and about the sixth hour : and he said unto the Jews , Behold your King .
GNV	John	19	15	But they cried , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate said unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The high Priests answered , We have no King but Caesar .
GNV	John	19	17	And he bare his own cross , and came into a place named of dead men ’ s skulls , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha :
GNV	John	19	18	Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
GNV	John	19	20	This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified , was near to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , and Latin .
GNV	John	19	21	Then said the high Priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews , but that he said , I am the King of the Jews .
GNV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , What I have written , I have written .
GNV	John	19	23	¶ [ i ] Then the ( C ) soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments ( and made four parts , to every soldier a part ) and his coat : and the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout .
GNV	John	19	24	¶ Therefore they said one to another , Let us not divide it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be . This was that the Scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , ( D ) They parted my garments among them , and on my coat did cast lots . So the soldiers did these things indeed .
GNV	John	19	25	¶ [ j ] Then stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
GNV	John	19	27	Then said he to the disciple , Behold thy mother : and from that hour , the disciple took her home unto him .
GNV	John	19	28	¶ [ k ] After , when Jesus knew that all things were performed , that the ( E ) Scripture might be fulfilled , he said , I thirst .
GNV	John	19	29	And there was set a [ l ] vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a sponge with vinegar : and put it about an Hyssop stalk , and put it to his mouth .
GNV	John	19	31	[ m ] The Jews then ( because it was the Preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day : for that Sabbath was an high day ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken down .
GNV	John	19	32	Then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first , and of the other , which was crucified with Jesus .
GNV	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs .
GNV	John	19	35	And he that saw it , bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe it .
GNV	John	19	36	For these things were done , that the Scripture should be fulfilled , ( F ) Not a bone of him shall be broken .
GNV	John	19	37	And again another Scripture saith , ( G ) They shall see him whom they have thrust through .
GNV	John	19	38	( H ) [ p ] And after these things , Joseph of Arimathea ( who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews ) besought Pilate that he might take down the body of Jesus . And Pilate gave him license . He came then and took Jesus ’ body .
GNV	John	19	39	And there came ( I ) also Nicodemus ( which first came to Jesus by night ) and brought of myrrh and aloes mingled together about an hundred pounds .
GNV	John	19	41	And in that place where Jesus was crucified , was a garden , and in the garden a new sepulcher , wherein was [ q ] never man yet laid .
GNV	John	19	42	There then laid they Jesus , because of the Jews ’ Preparation day , for the sepulcher was near .

GNV	John	20	1	Now ( A ) [ a ] the first day of the week came Mary Magdalene , early when it was yet dark , unto the sepulcher , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
GNV	John	20	3	Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and they came unto the sepulcher .
GNV	John	20	4	So they ran both together , but the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulcher .
GNV	John	20	15	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She supposing that he had been the gardener , said unto him , Sir , if thou hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
GNV	John	20	19	¶ ( C ) [ j ] The same day then at night , which was the first day of the week , and when the [ k ] doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and said to them , Peace be unto you .
GNV	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord : but he said unto them , Except I see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and put mine hand into his side , I will not believe it .
GNV	John	20	29	[ n ] Jesus said unto him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou believest : blessed are they that have not seen , and have believed .
GNV	John	20	2	Then she ran , and came to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and said unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher , and we know not where they have laid him .
GNV	John	20	5	And he stooped down , and saw the linen clothes lying : yet went he not in .
GNV	John	20	6	Then came Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulcher , and saw the linen clothes lie ,
GNV	John	20	7	And the kerchief that was upon his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
GNV	John	20	8	Then went in also the other disciple , which came first to the sepulcher , and he saw it , and believed .
GNV	John	20	9	For as yet they knew not the Scripture , That he must rise again from the dead .
GNV	John	20	10	And the disciples went away again unto their own home .
GNV	John	20	11	¶ ( B ) But Mary stood [ b ] without at the sepulcher weeping : and as she wept , she bowed herself into the sepulcher ,
GNV	John	20	12	[ c ] And saw two Angels in [ d ] white , sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
GNV	John	20	13	And they said unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She said unto them , They have taken away [ e ] my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
GNV	John	20	14	[ f ] When she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
GNV	John	20	16	Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turned herself , and said unto him , Rabboni , which is to say , Master .
GNV	John	20	17	[ g ] Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not : for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my [ h ] brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto [ i ] my Father , and to your Father , and to my God , and your God .
GNV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
GNV	John	20	21	( D ) Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father sent me , so send I you .
GNV	John	20	22	And when he had said that , he breathed on them , and said unto them , Receive the holy Ghost .
GNV	John	20	23	[ l ] Whosoever ’ s sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them : and whosoever ’ s sins ye retain , they are retained .
GNV	John	20	24	¶ [ m ] But Thomas one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
GNV	John	20	26	¶ And eight days after , again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them . Then came Jesus , when the doors were shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
GNV	John	20	27	After said he to Thomas , Put thy finger here , and see mine hands , and put forth thine hand , and put it into my side , and be not faithless , but faithful .
GNV	John	20	28	Then Thomas answered , and said unto him , Thou art my Lord , and my God .
GNV	John	20	30	( E ) [ o ] And many other signs also did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book .
GNV	John	20	31	But these things are written that ye might believe , that Jesus is that Christ that Son of God , and that in believing ye might have life through his Name . Footnotes - John 20:1 Mary Magdalene , Peter and John are the first witnesses of the resurrection : and such as can not justly be suspected , for that they themselves could scarcely be persuaded of it , so far is it off , that they should invent it of set purpose . - John 20:11 That is , without the cave , which the sepulchre was cut out of . - John 20:12 Two Angels are made witnesses of the Lord ’ s resurrection . - John 20:12 In white clothing . - John 20:13 Many speak as the common people use to speak : for they speak of a dead carcass , as they do of a whole man . - John 20:14 Jesus witnesseth by his presence , that he is truly risen . - John 20:17 Christ which is risen , is not to be sought in this world according to the flesh , but in heaven by faith , whither he is gone before us . - John 20:17 By his brethren he meaneth his disciples : for in the next verse following , it is said , that Mary told his disciples . - John 20:17 He calleth God his Father because he is his Father naturally in the Godhead , and he saith your Father , because he is our Father by grace , through the adoption of the sons of God : that is , by taking us of his free grace to be his sons , Epiphanius . - John 20:19 Christ in that that he presented himself before his disciples suddenly through his divine power , when the gates were shut , doth fully assure them both of his resurrection , and also of their Apostleship , inspiring them with the holy Ghost , who is the director of the ministry of the Gospel . - John 20:19 Either the doors opened to him of their own accord , or the very walls themselves were a passage for him . - John 20:23 The publishing of the forgiveness of sins by faith in Christ , and the setting forth and denouncing the wrath of God in retaining the sins of the unbelievers , is the sum of the preaching of the Gospel . - John 20:24 Christ draweth out of the unbelief of Thomas , a certain and sure testimony of his resurrection . - John 20:29 True faith dependeth upon the mouth of God , and not upon fleshly eyes . - John 20:30 To believe in Christ , the Son of God , and our only Savior , is the end of the doctrine of the Gospel , and especially of the history of the resurrection .

GNV	John	21	1	After these things , [ a ] Jesus showed himself again to his disciples at the sea of Tiberias : and thus showed he himself :
GNV	John	21	6	Then he said unto them , Cast out the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . So they cast out , and they were not able at all to draw it , for the multitude of fishes .
GNV	John	21	7	Therefore said the disciple whom Jesus loved , unto Peter , It is the Lord . When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girded his [ b ] coat to him ( for he was naked ) and cast himself into the sea .
GNV	John	21	15	¶ [ c ] So when they had dined , Jesus said to Simon Peter , Simon the son of Jonah , lovest thou me more than these ? He said unto him , Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee . He said unto him , Feed my lambs .
GNV	John	21	18	[ e ] Verily , verily I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou [ f ] girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thine hands , and another shall [ g ] gird thee , and lead thee without thou wouldest [ h ] not .
GNV	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas , which is called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples .
GNV	John	21	3	Simon Peter said unto them , I go a fishing . They said unto him , We also will go with thee . They went their way and entered into a ship straightway , and that night caught they nothing .
GNV	John	21	4	But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : nevertheless the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
GNV	John	21	5	Jesus then said unto them , Sirs , have ye any meat ? They answered him , No .
GNV	John	21	8	But the other disciples came by ship , ( for they were not far from land , but about two hundred cubits ) and they drew the net with fishes .
GNV	John	21	9	As soon then as they were come to land , they saw hot coals , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
GNV	John	21	10	Jesus said unto them , Bring of the fishes , which ye have now caught .
GNV	John	21	11	Simon Peter stepped forth and drew the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred , fifty and three : and albeit there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
GNV	John	21	12	Jesus said unto them , Come , and dine . And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ? seeing they knew that he was the Lord .
GNV	John	21	13	Jesus then came and took bread and gave them , and fish likewise .
GNV	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen again from the dead .
GNV	John	21	16	He said to him again the second time , Simon the son of Jonah , lovest thou me ? He said unto him , Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee . He said unto him , Feed my sheep .
GNV	John	21	17	He said unto him [ d ] the third time , Simon the son of Jonah , lovest thou me ? Peter was sorry because he said to him the third time , Lovest thou me ? and said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things : thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus said unto him , Feed my sheep .
GNV	John	21	19	And this spake he signifying by what [ i ] death he should glorify God . And when he had said this , he said to him , Follow me .
GNV	John	21	20	[ j ] Then Peter turned about , and saw the disciple whom JESUS loved , following , which had also ( A ) leaned on his breast at supper , and had said , Lord , which is he that betrayeth thee ?
GNV	John	21	22	Jesus said unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is it to thee ? follow thou me .
GNV	John	21	23	Then went this word abroad among the brethren , that this disciple should not die . Yet Jesus said not to him , He shall not die : but if I will that he tarry till I come , what is it to thee ?
GNV	John	21	24	[ k ] This is that disciple , which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things , and we know that his testimony is true .
GNV	John	21	25	( B ) Now there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which if they should be written every one , I suppose the world could not contain the books that should be written , Amen . Footnotes - John 21:1 In that , that Christ here is not only present , but also eateth with his disciples , he giveth a most full assurance of his resurrection . - John 21:7 It was a linen garment , which could not let his swimming . - John 21:15 Peter by his triple confession is restored into his former degree from whence he fell by his triple denial : and therewithal is advertised , that he is indeed a pastor , which showeth his love to Christ in feeding his sheep . - John 21:17 It was meet that he that had denied him thrice , should confess him thrice , that Peter might neither doubt of the forgiveness of his so grievous a sin , nor of his restoring to the office of the Apostleship . - John 21:18 The violent death of Peter is foretold . - John 21:18 They that took far journeys , especially in the East country , and in those places [ where ] the people used long garments , had need to be girded and trussed up . - John 21:18 He meant that kind of girding which is used toward captives , when they are bound fast with cords and chains , as who would say , Now thou girdest thyself as thou thinkest best , to go whither thou listest , but the time will be , when thou shall not gird thee with a girdle , but another shall bind thee with chains , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not . - John 21:18 Not that Peter suffered ought for the truth of God against his will : for we read that he came with joy and gladness when he returned from the Council where he was whipped : but because this will cometh not from the flesh , but from the gift of the Spirit which is given us from above , therefore he showeth there should be a certain striving and conflict or repugnancy , which also is in us , in all our sufferances as touching the flesh . - John 21:19 That is , that Peter should die by a violent death . - John 21:20 We must take heed , that while we cast our eyes upon others , we neglect not that which is enjoined us . - John 21:24 The history of Christ is true and warily written : not for the curiosity of men , but for the salvation of the godly .

GNV	Romans	1	16	. - Romans 1:1 He moving the Romans to give diligent ear unto him in that he showeth that he cometh not in his own name , but as God ’ s messenger unto the Gentiles , entreateth with them of the weightiest matter , that is promised long since by God , by many fit witnesses , and now at length performed indeed . - Romans 1:1 A Minister , for this word servant , is not taken in this place , as set against this word , Freeman , but declareth his ministry and office . - Romans 1:1 Whereas he said before in a general term , that he was a minister , now he cometh to a more special name , and saith that he is an Apostle , and that he took not upon him this office of his own lead , but being called of God , and therefore in this his writing to the Romans , doeth nothing but his duty . - Romans 1:1 Appointed of God to preach the Gospel . - Romans 1:3 By declaring the sum of the doctrine of the Gospel , he stirreth up the Romans to good consideration of the matter whereof he entreateth : So then he showeth that Christ ( who is the very substance and sum of the Gospel ) is the only son of God the Father , who as touching his humanity , is made of the seed of David , but touching his divine and spiritual nature , whereby he sanctified himself , is begotten of the Father from everlasting , as by his mighty resurrection manifestly appeareth . - Romans 1:3 This is a plain testimony of the person of Christ , that he is but one , and of his two natures , and their properties . - Romans 1:3 Which took flesh of the virgin , David ’ s daughter . - Romans 1:3 As he is man : for this word Flesh , by the figure Synecdoche , is taken for man . - Romans 1:4 Showed and made manifest . - Romans 1:4 The divine and mighty power is set against the weakness of the flesh , for that overcame death . - Romans 1:5 Of whom . - Romans 1:5 This marvelous liberal and gracious gift , which is given me , the least of all the Saints , to preach , etc. , Eph . 3:8 . - Romans 1:5 That men through faith might obey God . - Romans 1:5 For his Name ’ s sake . - Romans 1:6 Which through God ’ s goodness , are Christ ’ s . - Romans 1:7 God ’ s free good will : by peace , the Hebrews mean a prosperous success in all things . - Romans 1:8 He procureth their favorable patience , in that he reckoneth up their true commendation , and his true Apostolic good will toward them , confirmed by taking God himself to witness . - Romans 1:8 Because your faith is such , that it is commended in all Churches . - Romans 1:8 In all Churches . - Romans 1:9 Very willingly and with all my heart . - Romans 1:9 In preaching his Son . - Romans 1:12 Though Paul were never so excellent , yet by teaching the Church , he might be instructed by it . - Romans 1:15 He meaneth all them that dwelt in Rome , though some of them were not Romans , see the end of the epistle . - Romans 1:16 The second part of the Epistle unto the beginning of Chap .
GNV	Romans	1	17	[ ab ] For by it the righteousness of God is revealed from [ ac ] faith to faith : [ ad ] as it is written , ( B ) The just shall live by faith .
GNV	Romans	1	21	Because that when they knew God , they [ ak ] glorified him not as God , neither were thankful , but became [ al ] vain in their thoughts , and their foolish heart was full of darkness .
GNV	Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up to vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature .
GNV	Romans	1	29	Being full of all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness , full of envy , of murder , of debate , of deceit , taking all things in the evil part , whisperers ,
GNV	Romans	1	2	( Which he had promised afore by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures )
GNV	Romans	1	3	[ f ] Concerning his [ g ] Son Jesus Christ our Lord ( which was [ h ] made of the seed of David [ i ] according to the flesh ,
GNV	Romans	1	4	And [ j ] declared [ k ] mightily to be the Son of God , touching the Spirit of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead )
GNV	Romans	1	5	[ l ] By whom we have received [ m ] grace and Apostleship ( that [ n ] obedience might be given unto the faith ) for his name [ o ] among all the Gentiles ,
GNV	Romans	1	6	Among whom ye be also the [ p ] called of Jesus Christ :
GNV	Romans	1	7	To all you that be at Rome beloved of God , called to be Saints : [ q ] Grace be with you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	Romans	1	8	[ r ] First I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , because your faith is [ s ] published throughout the [ t ] whole world .
GNV	Romans	1	9	. Now the whole end and purpose of the disputation is this : that is to say : to show that there is but one way to attain unto salvation ( which is set forth unto us of God in the Gospel , without any difference of nations ) and that is Jesus Christ apprehended by faith . - Romans 1:16 God ’ s mighty and effectual instrument to save men by . - Romans 1:16 When this word Grecian , is set against this word Jew , then doth it signify a Gentile . - Romans 1:17 The confirmation of the former proposition : we are taught in the Gospel that we are justified before God by faith which increaseth daily : and therefore also saved . - Romans 1:17 From faith which increaseth daily . - Romans 1:17 The proof as well of the first as the second proposition , out of Habakkuk , who attributeth and giveth unto faith both justice and life before God . - Romans 1:18 Another confirmation of that principal question : All men being considered in themselves or without Christ , are guilty both of [ ungodliness ] , and also unrighteousness , and therefore are subject to condemnation : Therefore must they needs seek righteousness in some other . - Romans 1:18 Against all kinds of ungodliness . - Romans 1:18 By truth , Paul meaneth all the light that is left in man since his fall , not as though they being led thereby were able to come into favor with God , but that their own reason might condemn them of wickedness both against God and man . - Romans 1:19 Their ungodliness he proveth hereby , that although all men have a most clear and evident glass wherein to behold the everlasting and almighty nature of God , even in his creatures , yet have they fallen away from those principles to most foolish and sound devices of their own brains , in consituting and appointing the service of God . - Romans 1:19 In their hearts . - Romans 1:20 Thou seest not God , and yet thou acknowledgest him as God by his works , Cicero . - Romans 1:21 They did not honor him with that honor , and service , which was meet for his everlasting power and Godhead . - Romans 1:21 As if he said , became so mad of themselves . - Romans 1:22 Or thought themselves . - Romans 1:23 For the true God they took another . - Romans 1:24 The unrighteousness of men he setteth forth first , in this , that even against nature following their lusts , they defiled themselves one with another , by the just judgment of God . - Romans 1:24 The contempt of religion , is the fountain of all mischief . - Romans 1:24 As a just judge . - Romans 1:27 A meet reward for their deserts . - Romans 1:28 He proveth the unrighteousness of man by a large rehearsal of many kinds of wickedness , from which ( if not from all , yet at the least from many of them ) no man is altogether free . - Romans 1:28 Into a mad and froward mind , whereby it cometh to pass , that the conscience being once put out , and having almost no more remorse of sin , men run headlong into all kinds of mischief . - Romans 1:30 Unmindful of their covenants and bargains . - Romans 1:31 By the Law of God he meaneth that which the Philosophers called the Law of nature , and the Lawyers themselves termed the Law of nations . - Romans 1:31 Are fellows and partakers with them in their wickedness , and besides that , commend them which do amiss . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Romans	1	10	Always in my prayers , beseeching that by some means , one time or other I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God , to come unto you .
GNV	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that I might bestow among you some spiritual gift , that you might be strengthened :
GNV	Romans	1	12	That is , that [ w ] I might be comforted together with you , through our mutual faith , both yours and mine .
GNV	Romans	1	13	Now my brethren , I would that ye should not be ignorant , how that I have oftentimes purposed to come unto you ( but have been let hitherto ) that I might have some fruit also among you , as I have among the other Gentiles .
GNV	Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to the Grecians , and to the Barbarians , both to the wise men and to the unwise .
GNV	Romans	1	18	[ ae ] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against [ af ] all ungodliness , and unrighteousness of men , which withhold the [ ag ] truth in unrighteousness .
GNV	Romans	1	19	[ ah ] Forasmuch as that , which may be known of God , is manifest in [ ai ] them , for God hath showed it unto them .
GNV	Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him , that is , his eternal power and Godhead , are seen by the creation of the world , being [ aj ] considered in his works , to the intent that they should be without excuse :
GNV	Romans	1	22	When they [ am ] professed themselves to be wise , they became fools .
GNV	Romans	1	23	For they turned the glory of the [ an ] incorruptible God to the similitude of the image of a corruptible man , and of birds , and four footed beasts , and of creeping things .
GNV	Romans	1	24	[ ao ] Wherefore [ ap ] also God [ aq ] gave them up to their hearts lusts , unto uncleanness , to defile their own bodies between themselves :
GNV	Romans	1	25	Which turned the truth of God unto a lie , and worshipped and served the creature , forsaking the Creator which is blessed forever , Amen .
GNV	Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men left the natural use of the woman , and burned in their lust one toward another , and man with man wrought filthiness , and received in themselves such [ ar ] recompense of their error , as was meet .
GNV	Romans	1	28	[ as ] For as they regarded not to acknowledge God , even so God delivered them up unto a [ at ] reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ,
GNV	Romans	1	30	Backbiters , haters of God , doers of wrong , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents , without understanding , [ au ] covenant breakers , without natural affection , such as can never be appeased , merciless .
GNV	Romans	1	31	Which men , though they knew the [ av ] Law of God , how that they which commit such things are worthy of death , yet not only do the same , but also [ aw ] favor them that do them . Footnotes - Romans 1:1 The first part of the Epistle containing a most profitable preface unto verse
GNV	Romans	2	2	But we [ b ] know that the judgment of God is according to [ c ] truth , against them which commit such things .

GNV	Romans	2	1	Therefore [ a ] thou art inexcusable , O man , whosoever thou art that condemnest : for in that thou condemnest another , thou condemnest thyself : for thou that condemnest , doest the same things .
GNV	Romans	2	12	[ k ] For as many as have sinned without the Law , shall perish also without the Law : and as many as have sinned in the Law , shall be judged by the Law ,
GNV	Romans	2	14	[ n ] For when the Gentiles which have [ o ] not the Law , do by [ p ] nature the things contained in the Law , they having not the Law , are a Law unto themselves ,
GNV	Romans	2	17	¶ [ t ] Behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the Law , and gloriest in God ,
GNV	Romans	2	23	Thou that gloriest in the Law , through breaking the Law , dishonorest thou God ?
GNV	Romans	2	27	And shall not [ ab ] uncircumcision which is by nature ( if it keep the Law ) condemn thee which by the [ ac ] letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the Law ?
GNV	Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this , O thou man , that condemnest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
GNV	Romans	2	4	[ d ] Or despisest thou the riches of his bountifulness , and patience , and long sufferance , not knowing that the bountifulness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
GNV	Romans	2	5	But thou , after thine hardness , and heart that can not repent , ( A ) [ e ] heapest up as a treasure unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath , and of the declaration of the just judgment of God ,
GNV	Romans	2	6	( B ) [ f ] Who will reward every man according to his works :
GNV	Romans	2	7	That is , to them which through patience in well doing , seek [ g ] glory , and honor , and immortality , everlasting life :
GNV	Romans	2	8	But unto them that are contentious , and disobey the [ h ] truth , and obey unrighteousness , shall be [ i ] indignation and wrath .
GNV	Romans	2	9	Tribulation and anguish shall be upon the soul of every man that doeth evil : of the Jew first , and also of the Grecian .
GNV	Romans	2	10	But to every man that doeth good , shall be glory , and honor , and peace : to the Jew first , and also to the Grecian .
GNV	Romans	2	11	For there is [ j ] no respect of persons with God .
GNV	Romans	2	13	[ l ] ( For the hearers of the Law are not righteous before God : but the doers of the Law shall be [ m ] justified .
GNV	Romans	2	15	Which show the effect of the Law [ q ] written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts accusing one another , or excusing . )
GNV	Romans	2	16	[ r ] At the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ , according to [ s ] my Gospel .
GNV	Romans	2	18	And knowest his will , and [ u ] [ v ] triest the things that dissent from it , in that thou art instructed by the Law :
GNV	Romans	2	19	And persuadest thyself that thou art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
GNV	Romans	2	20	An instructor of them which lack discretion , a teacher of the unlearned , which hast the [ w ] form of knowledge , and of the truth in the [ x ] law .
GNV	Romans	2	21	Thou therefore , which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest , A man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
GNV	Romans	2	22	Thou that sayest , A man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , committest thou sacrilege ?
GNV	Romans	2	24	For the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you , ( C ) as it is written .
GNV	Romans	2	25	[ y ] For circumcision verily is profitable , if thou do the Law : but if thou be a transgressor of the Law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
GNV	Romans	2	26	Therefore [ z ] if the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the Law , shall not his [ aa ] uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
GNV	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew , which is one [ ad ] outward : neither is that circumcision , which is outward in the flesh :
GNV	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew which is one within , and the circumcision is of the heart , in the [ ae ] spirit , not in the letter , whose praise is not of men , but of God . Footnotes - Romans 2:1 He convinceth them which would seem to be exempt out of the number of other men , because they reprehend other men ’ s faults , and saith that they are least of all to be excused , for if they were well and narrowly searched ( as God surely doth ) they themselves would be found guilty in those things which they reprehend , and punish in others : so that in condemning others they pronounce sentence against themselves . - Romans 2:2 Paul allegeth no places of Scripture , for he reasoneth generally against all men : but he bringeth such reasons as every man is persuaded of in his mind , so that the devil himself is not able to pluck them clean out . - Romans 2:2 Considering and judging things aright , and not by any outward show . - Romans 2:4 A vehement and grievous crying out against them that please themselves , because they see more than others do , and yet are no whit better than others are . - Romans 2:5 Whilst thou givest thyself to pleasures , thinking to increase thy goods , thou shalt find God ’ s wrath . - Romans 2:6 The ground of the former disputation , That both the Jews and Gentiles have together need of righteousness . - Romans 2:7 Glory which followeth good works , which he layeth not out before us , as though there were any that could attain to salvation by his own strength , but , by laying this condition of salvation before us , which no man can perform , to bring men to Christ , who alone justified the believers , as he himself concludeth , Rom . 2:21-22 , following . - Romans 2:8 By truth , he meaneth that knowledge which we have of nature . - Romans 2:8 God ’ s indignation against sinners , which shall quickly be kindled . - Romans 2:11 God doth not measure men either by their blood , or by their country , either to receive them , or to cast them away . - Romans 2:12 He applieth that general accusation of mankind particularly both to the Gentiles , and to the Jews . - Romans 2:13 He preventeth an objection which might be made by the Jews , whom the Law doth not excuse , but condemns , because that not the hearing of the Law , but the keeping of the Law doth justify . - Romans 2:13 Shall be pronounced just before God ’ s judgment seat : which is true indeed , if any such could be found that had fulfilled the law : but seeing Abraham was not justified by the Law , but by faith , it followeth that no man can be justified by works . - Romans 2:14 He preventeth an objection which might be made by the Gentiles , who although they have not the Law of Moses , yet they have no reason whereby they may excuse their wickedness in that they have somewhat written in their hearts instead of a Law , as men that forbid , and punish some things as wicked , and command and commend other some as good . - Romans 2:14 Not simply , but in comparison of the Jews . - Romans 2:14 Command honest things , and forbid dishonest . - Romans 2:15 This knowledge is a natural knowledge . - Romans 2:16 God deferreth many judgments , which notwithstanding he will execute at their convenient time by Jesus Christ , with a most straight examination , not only of words and deeds , but of thoughts also , be they never so hidden or secret . - Romans 2:16 As this my doctrine witnesseth , which I am appointed to preach . - Romans 2:17 He proveth by the testimony of David , and the other Prophets , that God bestowed greatest benefits upon the Jews , in giving them also the Law , but that they are the most unthankful and unkindest of all men . - Romans 2:18 Canst try and discern what things swerve from God ’ s will . - Romans 2:18 Or allowest the things that are excellent . - Romans 2:20 The way to teach and frame others in the knowledge of the truth . - Romans 2:20 As though he said , that the Jews under a color of an outward serving of God , challenged all to themselves , when as indeed , they did nothing less than observe the Law . - Romans 2:25 He precisely preventeth their objection , which set an holiness in circumcision , and the outward observation of the Law : So that he showeth that the outward circumcision , if it be separated from the inward , doth not only not justify , but also condemns them that are indeed circumcised , of whom requireth that , which is signifieth , that is to say , cleanness of the heart and the whole life , according to the commandment of the Law , so that if there be a man uncircumcised according to the flesh , who is circumcised in heart , he is far better and more to be more accounted of , than any Jew that is circumcised according to the flesh only . - Romans 2:26 This is the figure Metonymy , for , if the uncircumcised . - Romans 2:26 The state and condition of the uncircumcised . - Romans 2:27 He which is uncircumcised by nature and blood . - Romans 2:27 Paul useth oftentimes to set the letter against the Spirit : but in this place , the circumcision which is according to the letter , is the cutting off of the foreskin , but the circumcision of the Spirit , is the circumcision of the heart , that is to say , the spiritual end of the ceremony , is true holiness and righteousness whereby the people of God is known from profane and heathenish men . - Romans 2:28 By the outward ceremony only . - Romans 2:29 Whose force is inward , and in the heart .

GNV	Romans	3	1	What [ a ] is then the preferment of the Jew ? or what is the profit of circumcision ?
GNV	Romans	3	2	Much every manner of way : for [ b ] chiefly , because unto them were of credit committed the [ c ] oracles of God .
GNV	Romans	3	4	God forbid : yea , let God be true , and every man a liar , as it is written , That thou mightest be [ f ] justified in thy words , and overcome , [ g ] when thou art judged .
GNV	Romans	3	9	[ m ] What then ? are we more excellent ? No , in no wise : for we have already proved , that all , both Jews and Gentiles are [ n ] under sin ,
GNV	Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth : there is none that seeketh God .
GNV	Romans	3	19	[ p ] Now we know that whatsoever the [ q ] law saith , it saith it to them which are under the law , that [ r ] every mouth may be stopped , and all the world be [ s ] subject to the judgment of God .
GNV	Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude , that a man is justified by faith , without the works of the Law .
GNV	Romans	3	5	[ h ] Now if our [ i ] unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? is God unrighteous which punisheth ? ( I speak as [ j ] a man . )
GNV	Romans	3	6	God forbid : ( else how shall God judge the world ? )
GNV	Romans	3	7	[ k ] For if the [ l ] verity of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory , why am I yet condemned as a sinner ?
GNV	Romans	3	8	of the first Chapter . Therefore saith the Apostle , No man can hope to be justified by any Law , whether it be that general Law , or the particular Law of Moses , and therefore to be saved : seeing it appeareth ( as we have already proved ) by comparing the Law and man ’ s life together , that all men are sinners , and therefore worthy of condemnation in the sight of God . - Romans 3:19 Be found guilty before God . - Romans 3:20 By that that the Law can by us be performed . - Romans 3:20 Flesh is here taken for man , as in many other places , and furthermore hath here a greater force : for it is put to show the contrariety betwixt God and man : as if you would say , Man who is nothing else but a piece of flesh defiled with sin , and God who is most pure and most perfect in himself . - Romans 3:20 Absolved before the judgment seat of God . - Romans 3:20 A secret setting of the righteousness which is before men , be they never so just , against the justice which can stand before God : now there is no righteousness can stand before God , but the righteousness of Christ only . - Romans 3:21 Therefore saith the Apostle , Lest that men should perish , God doth now exhibit that , which he promised of old , that is to say , a way whereby we may be justified and saved before him without the Law . - Romans 3:22 The matter , as it were of this righteousness , is Christ Jesus apprehended by faith , and for this end offered to all people , as without him all people are shut out from the kingdom of God . - Romans 3:22 Which we give to Jesus Christ , or which resteth upon him . - Romans 3:23 By the Glory of God , is meant that mark which we all shoot at , that is , everlasting life , which standeth in that we are made partakers of the glory of God . - Romans 3:24 Therefore this righteousness touching us , is altogether freely given , for it standeth upon those things which we have not done ourselves , but such as Christ hath suffered for our sakes , to deliver us from sin . - Romans 3:24 Of his free gift , and mere liberality . - Romans 3:25 God then is the author of that free justification , because it pleaseth him : and Christ is he , which suffered punishment for our sins , and in whom we have remission of them : and the means whereby we apprehend Christ , is faith . To be short , the end is the setting forth of the goodness of God , that by this means it may appear , that he is merciful indeed , and constant in his promises , as he that freely , and of mere grace justifieth the believers . - Romans 3:25 This name of Blood , calleth us back to the figure of the old sacrifices , the truth and substance of which sacrifices is in Christ . - Romans 3:25 Of those sins which we committed when we were his enemies . - Romans 3:26 Through his patience , and suffering nature . - Romans 3:26 To wit , when Paul wrote this . - Romans 3:26 That he might be found exceeding true and faithful . - Romans 3:26 Making him just , and without blame by imputing Christ ’ s righteousness unto him . - Romans 3:26 Of the number of them which by faith lay hold upon Christ : contrary to whom , are they which look to be saved by circumcision , that is , by the Law . - Romans 3:27 An argument to prove this conclusion , that we are justified by faith without works , taken from the end of Justification . The end of Justification is the glory of God alone : therefore we are justified by faith without works : for if we were justified either by our own works only , or partly by faith , and partly by works , the glory of this justification should not be wholly given to God . - Romans 3:27 By what doctrine ? now the doctrine of works hath [ this ] condition joined with it , If thou doest : and the doctrine of faith hath this condition , If thou believest . - Romans 3:29 Another argument of an absurdity : if justification depended upon the Law of Moses , then should God be a Savior to the Jews only . Again : if he should save the Jews after one sort , and the Gentiles after another , he should not be one and like himself . Therefore he will justify both of them after one selfsame manner , that is to say , by faith . Moreover , this argument must be joined to that which followeth next , that this conclusion may be firm and evident . - Romans 3:29 God is said to be their God , after the manner of the Scripture , whom he loveth and tendereth . - Romans 3:30 The circumcised . - Romans 3:31 The taking away of an objection : yet it is not the Law taken away therefore , but is rather established , as it shall be declared in [ its ] proper place . - Romans 3:31 Vain , void , to no purpose , and of no force . - Romans 3:31 We make it effectual and strong . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Romans	3	10	As it is written , ( A ) There is none righteous no not one .
GNV	Romans	3	12	They have all gone out of the way : they have been made altogether unprofitable : there is none that doeth good , no not one .
GNV	Romans	3	13	( B ) Their throat is an open sepulcher : they have used their tongues to deceit : ( C ) the poison of asps is under their lips .
GNV	Romans	3	14	( D ) Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness .
GNV	Romans	3	15	( E ) Their feet are swift to shed blood .
GNV	Romans	3	16	Destruction and calamity are in their ways :
GNV	Romans	3	17	And the [ o ] way of peace they have not known .
GNV	Romans	3	18	( F ) The fear of God is not before their eyes .
GNV	Romans	3	20	Therefore by the [ t ] works of the Law shall no [ u ] flesh be [ v ] justified in his [ w ] sight : for by the Law cometh the knowledge of sin .
GNV	Romans	3	21	[ x ] But now is the righteousness of God made manifest without the Law , having witness of the Law , and of the Prophets ,
GNV	Romans	3	22	[ y ] To wit , the righteousness of God by the faith of [ z ] Jesus Christ , unto all , and upon all that believe .
GNV	Romans	3	23	For there is no difference : for all have sinned , and are deprived of the [ aa ] glory of God ,
GNV	Romans	3	24	[ ab ] And are justified [ ac ] freely by his grace , through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus ,
GNV	Romans	3	25	[ ad ] Whom God hath set forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his [ ae ] blood to declare his righteousness , by the forgiveness of the sins that [ af ] are passed ,
GNV	Romans	3	26	Through the [ ag ] patience of God , to show at [ ah ] this time his righteousness , that he might be [ ai ] just , and a [ aj ] justifier of him which is of the [ ak ] faith of Jesus .
GNV	Romans	3	27	[ al ] Where is then the rejoicing ? It is excluded . By what [ am ] Law ? of works ? Nay : but by the Law of faith .
GNV	Romans	3	29	[ an ] God , is he the God of the [ ao ] Jews only , and not of the Gentiles also ? Yes , even of the Gentiles also .
GNV	Romans	3	30	For it is one God , who shall justify [ ap ] circumcision of faith , and uncircumcision through faith .
GNV	Romans	3	31	[ aq ] Do we then make the Law of [ ar ] none effect through faith ? God forbid : yea , we [ as ] establish the Law . Footnotes - Romans 3:1 The first meeting with , or preventing an objection of the Jews : what then , have the Jews no more preferment than the Gentiles ? yes , that have they , saith the Apostle , on God ’ s behalf : for he committed the tables of the covenant to them , so that the unbelief of a few , can not cause the whole nation without exception to be cast away of God , who is true , and who also useth their unworthiness to commend and set forth his goodness . - Romans 3:2 The Jews ’ state and condition was chiefest . - Romans 3:2 Words . - Romans 3:3 Break the covenant . - Romans 3:3 The faith that God gave . - Romans 3:4 That thy justice might be plainly seen . - Romans 3:4 Forasmuch as thou showest forth an evident token of thy righteousness , constancy and faith , by preserving him who had broken his covenant . - Romans 3:5 Another prevention , issuing out of the former answer : that the justice of God is in such sort commended and set forth by our unrighteousness , that therefore God forgetteth not that he is the judge of the world , and therefore a most severe revenger of unrighteousness . - Romans 3:5 Treachery , and all the fruits thereof . - Romans 3:5 Therefore I speak not these words in mine own person , as though I thought so , but this is the talk of man ’ s wisdom , which is not subject to the will of God . - Romans 3:7 A third objection which addeth somewhat to the former , If sins do turn to the glory of God , they are not only not to be punished , but we ought rather to give ourselves to them : which blasphemy Paul contending himself to curse and detest , pronounceth just punishment against such blasphemers . - Romans 3:7 The truth and constancy . - Romans 3:9 Another answer to the first objection : that the Jews , if they be considered in themselves , are no better than other men are : as it has been long since pronounced by the mouth of the Prophets . - Romans 3:9 Are guilty of sin . - Romans 3:17 An innocent and peaceable life . - Romans 3:19 He proveth that this grievous accusation which is uttered by David and Isaiah , doth properly concern the Jews . - Romans 3:19 The law of Moses . - Romans 3:19 A conclusion of all the former disputation , from verse

GNV	Romans	4	1	What [ a ] shall we say then , that Abraham our father hath found concerning the [ b ] flesh ?
GNV	Romans	4	3	[ d ] For what saith the Scripture ? Abraham believed God , and it was counted to him for righteousness .
GNV	Romans	4	6	[ i ] Even as David declareth the blessedness of the man , unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works , saying ,
GNV	Romans	4	2	[ c ] For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath wherein to rejoice , but not with God .
GNV	Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not , but believeth in him that [ h ] justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
GNV	Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
GNV	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin .
GNV	Romans	4	9	[ j ] Came this [ k ] blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? For we say , that faith was imputed unto Abraham for righteousness .
GNV	Romans	4	10	[ l ] How was it then imputed ? when he was circumcised , or uncircumcised ? not when he was circumcised , but when he was uncircumcised .
GNV	Romans	4	11	[ m ] After , he received the [ n ] sign of circumcision , as the [ o ] seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had , when he was uncircumcised , [ p ] that he should be the father of all them that believe , not being circumcised , that righteousness might be imputed to them also .
GNV	Romans	4	12	[ q ] And the father of circumcision , not unto them only which are of the circumcision , but unto them also that walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had when he was uncircumcised .
GNV	Romans	4	13	[ r ] For the promise that he should be the [ s ] heir of the world , was not given to Abraham , or to his seed , through the [ t ] Law , but through the righteousness of faith .
GNV	Romans	4	14	[ u ] For if they which are of the [ v ] Law , be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise is made of none effect .
GNV	Romans	4	15	[ w ] For the Law causeth wrath : for where no Law is , there is no transgression .
GNV	Romans	4	16	[ x ] Therefore it is by faith , that it might come by grace , and the promise might be sure to all the [ y ] seed , [ z ] not to that only which is of the Law : but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all ,
GNV	Romans	4	17	( As it is written , I have made thee a [ aa ] father of many nations ) even before [ ab ] God whom he believed , who [ ac ] quickeneth the dead , and [ ad ] calleth those things which be not , as though they were .
GNV	Romans	4	18	[ ae ] Which Abraham above hope , believed under hope , that he should be the father of many nations : according to that which was spoken to him , So shall thy seed be .
GNV	Romans	4	19	And he [ af ] not weak in the faith , considered not his own body , which was now [ ag ] dead , being almost an hundred years old , neither the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb .
GNV	Romans	4	20	Neither did he doubt of the promise of God through unbelief , but was strengthened in the faith , and gave [ ah ] glory to God ,
GNV	Romans	4	21	Being [ ai ] fully assured that he which had promised , was also able to do it .
GNV	Romans	4	22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness .
GNV	Romans	4	23	[ aj ] Now is it not written for him only , that it was imputed to him for righteousness ,
GNV	Romans	4	24	But also for us , to whom it shall be imputed for righteousness , which believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
GNV	Romans	4	25	Who was delivered to death for our [ ak ] sins , and is risen again for our justification . Footnotes - Romans 4:1 A new argument of great weight , taken from the example of Abraham the father of all believers : And this is the proposition : if Abraham be considered in himself by his works , he hath deserved nothing wherein to rejoice with God . - Romans 4:1 By works , as appeareth in the next verse . - Romans 4:2 A preventing of an objection : Abraham may well rejoice and extol himself amongst men , but not with God . - Romans 4:3 A confirmation of the proposition : Abraham was justified by imputation of faith , therefore freely without any respect of his works . - Romans 4:4 The first proof of the confirmation , taken of contraries : to him that deserveth anything by his labor , the wages is not counted by favor , but by debt : but to him that hath done nothing , but believeth in him which promiseth freely , faith is imputed . - Romans 4:4 To him that hath deserved anything by his work . - Romans 4:4 Is not reckoned nor given him . - Romans 4:5 That maketh him which is wicked in himself , just in Christ . - Romans 4:6 Another proof of the same confirmation : David putteth blessedness in free pardon of sins , therefore justification also . - Romans 4:9 A new proposition : that this manner of justification belongeth both to uncircumcised , and also to the circumcised , as is declared in the person of Abraham . - Romans 4:9 This saying of David , wherein he pronounceth them blessed . - Romans 4:10 He proveth that it belongeth to the uncircumcised ( for there was no doubt of the circumcised ) in this sort : Abraham was justified in uncircumcision , therefore this justification belongeth also to the uncircumcised . Nay , it does not appertain to the circumcised in respect of the circumcision , much less are the uncircumcised shut out for their uncircumcision . - Romans 4:11 A preventing of an objection : why then was Abraham circumcised , if he were already justified ? That the gift of righteousness ( saith he ) might be confirmed in him . - Romans 4:11 Circumcision , which is a sign : as we say , the Sacrament of Baptism , for Baptism which is a Sacrament . - Romans 4:11 Circumcision was called before a sign , in respect of the outward ceremony : now Paul showeth the force and substance of that sign , that is , to what end it is used , to wit , not only to signify , but also to seal up the righteousness of faith , whereby we come to possess Christ himself : for the holy Ghost worketh that inwardly indeed , which the Sacraments being joined with the word , do represent . - Romans 4:11 An applying of the example of Abraham to the uncircumcised believers , whose father also he maketh Abraham . - Romans 4:12 An applying of the same example , to the circumcised believers , whose father Abraham is , but yet by faith . - Romans 4:13 A reason why the seed of Abraham is to be esteemed by faith , because that Abraham himself through faith was made partaker of that promise , whereby he was made the father of all nations . - Romans 4:13 That all the nations of the world should be his children : or by the world may be understood the land of Canaan . - Romans 4:13 For works that he had done , or upon this condition that he should fulfill the Law . - Romans 4:14 A double confirmation of that reason : the one is , that the promise can not be apprehended by the Law , and therefore it should be frustrated : the other , that the condition of faith should be joined in vain to that promise which should be apprehended by works . - Romans 4:14 If they be heirs which have fulfilled the Law . - Romans 4:15 A reason of the first confirmation , why the promise can not be apprehended by the Law : because that the Law doth not reconcile God and us , but rather denounceth his anger against us , forsomuch as no man can observe it . - Romans 4:16 The conclusion of this argument . The salvation and justification of all the posterity of Abraham ( that is , of the Church which is gathered together of all people ) proceedeth of faith , which layeth hold on the promise made unto Abraham , and which promise Abraham himself first of all laid hold on . - Romans 4:16 To all the believers . - Romans 4:16 That is to say , not only of them which believe and are also circumcised according to the Law , but of them also which without circumcision , and in respect of faith only , are counted amongst the children of Abraham . - Romans 4:17 This fatherhood is spiritual , depending only upon the virtue of God , who made the promise . - Romans 4:17 Before God , that is , by a spiritual kindred , which had place before God , and maketh us acceptable to God . - Romans 4:17 Who restored to life . - Romans 4:17 With whom these things are already , which as yet are not in deed , as he that can with a word make what he will of nothing . - Romans 4:18 A description of true faith , wholly resting in the power of God , and his good will , set forth in the example of Abraham . - Romans 4:19 Very strong and constant . - Romans 4:19 Void of strength , and unmeet to get children . - Romans 4:20 Acknowledged and praised God , as most gracious and true . - Romans 4:21 A description of true faith . - Romans 4:23 The rule of justification is always one , both in Abraham and in all the faithful : that is to say , faith in God , who after that there was made a full satisfaction for our sins in Christ our mediator , raised him from the dead , that we also being justified , might be saved in him . - Romans 4:25 To pay the ransom for our sins .

GNV	Romans	5	5	[ j ] And hope maketh not ashamed , because the [ k ] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost , which is given unto us .

GNV	Romans	5	1	Then being [ a ] justified by faith , we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	Romans	5	2	( A ) [ b ] By whom also through faith we have [ c ] had this access into this grace [ d ] wherein we [ e ] stand , [ f ] and [ g ] rejoice under the hope of the glory of God .
GNV	Romans	5	8	But God [ p ] setteth out his love towards us , seeing that while we were yet [ q ] sinners , Christ died for us .
GNV	Romans	5	14	[ aa ] But death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over [ ab ] them also that sinned not after the like [ ac ] manner of the transgression of Adam , [ ad ] which was the figure of him that was to come .
GNV	Romans	5	17	[ ai ] For if by the offense of one , death reigned through one , much more shall they which receive that abundance of grace , and of that gift of that righteousness , [ aj ] reign in life through one , that is , Jesus Christ .
GNV	Romans	5	20	[ ap ] Moreover , the Law [ aq ] entered thereupon , that the offense should abound : nevertheless , where sin abounded , there grace [ ar ] abounded much more :
GNV	Romans	5	3	[ h ] Neither that only , but also we ( B ) rejoice in tribulations , [ i ] knowing that tribulation bringeth forth patience .
GNV	Romans	5	4	And patience experience , and experience hope .
GNV	Romans	5	6	[ l ] For Christ , when we were yet of no strength , at his [ m ] time died for the ( C ) ungodly .
GNV	Romans	5	7	[ n ] Doubtless one will scarce die [ o ] for a righteous man : but yet for a good man it may be that one dare die .
GNV	Romans	5	9	Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from [ r ] wrath through him .
GNV	Romans	5	10	For if when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life ,
GNV	Romans	5	11	[ s ] And not only so , but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
GNV	Romans	5	12	[ t ] Wherefore , as by [ u ] one man [ v ] sin entered into the world , and death by sin , and so death went over all men : [ w ] in whom all men have sinned .
GNV	Romans	5	13	[ x ] For unto the [ y ] time of the Law was sin in the world , but sin is not [ z ] imputed , while there is no law .
GNV	Romans	5	15	[ ae ] But yet the gift is not so as is the offense : for if through the offense of [ af ] that one , many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
GNV	Romans	5	16	[ ag ] Neither is the gift so , as that which entered in by one that sinned : for the fault came of one offense unto condemnation : but the gift is of many offenses to [ ah ] justification .
GNV	Romans	5	18	[ ak ] Likewise then , as by the offense of one , the fault came on all men to condemnation , so by the justifying of one , the benefit abounded toward all men to the [ al ] justification of life .
GNV	Romans	5	19	[ am ] For as by one man ’ s [ an ] disobedience [ ao ] many were made sinners , so by that obedience of that one , shall many also be made righteous .
GNV	Romans	5	21	That as sin had reigned unto death , so might grace also reign by righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 5:1 Another argument taken of the effects : we are justified with that , which truly appeaseth our conscience before God but faith in Christ doth appease our conscience , and not the Law , as it was before said , therefore by faith we are justified , and not by the Law . - Romans 5:2 Whereas quietness of conscience is attributed to faith , it is to be referred to Christ , who is the giver of faith itself , and in whom faith itself is effectual . - Romans 5:2 We must here know , that we have yet still this same effect of faith . - Romans 5:2 By which grace , that is , by which gracious love and good will , or that state whereunto we are graciously taken . - Romans 5:2 We stand steadfast . - Romans 5:2 A preventing of an objection against them which beholding the daily miseries and calamities of the Church , think that the Christians dream , when they brag of their felicity : to whom the Apostle answereth , that their felicity is laid up under hope of another place : which hope is so certain and sure , that they do not less rejoice for that happiness , than if they did presently enjoy it . - Romans 5:2 Our minds are not only quiet and settled , but also we are marvelously glad and conceive great joy for that heavenly inheritance which waiteth for us . - Romans 5:3 Tribulation itself giveth us divers and sundry ways occasion to rejoice , much less doth it make us miserable . - Romans 5:3 Afflictions accustom us to patience , and patience assureth us of the goodness of God , and this experience confirmeth , and fostereth our hope , which never deceiveth us . - Romans 5:5 The ground of hope is an assured testimony of the conscience , by the gift of the holy Ghost , that we are beloved of God , and this is nothing else but that which we call faith : whereof it followeth , that through faith our consciences are quieted . - Romans 5:5 Wherewith he loveth us . - Romans 5:6 A sure comfort in adversity , that our peace and quietness of conscience be not troubled : for he that so loved them that were of no strength , and while they were yet sinners , that he died for them , how can he neglect them being now sanctified and living in him ? - Romans 5:6 In time fit and convenient , which the father hath appointed . - Romans 5:7 An amplifying of the love of God towards us , so that we can not doubt of it , who delivereth Christ to death for the unjust , and for them of whom he could receive no commodity , and ( that more is ) for his very enemies . How can it be then that Christ being now alive , should not save them from destruction , whom by his death he justifieth and reconcileth ? - Romans 5:7 In the stead of some just man . - Romans 5:8 He setteth out his love unto us , that in the midst of our afflictions we may know assuredly , he will be present with us . - Romans 5:8 While sin reigned in us . - Romans 5:9 From affliction and destruction . - Romans 5:11 He now passeth over to the other part of justification , which consisteth in the free imputation of the obedience of Christ : so that to the remission of sins there is added moreover and besides , the gift of Christ ’ s righteousness imputed or put upon us by faith , which swalloweth up that unrighteousness which flowed from Adam into us , and all the fruits thereof : so that in Christ we do not only cease to be unjust , but we begin also to be just . - Romans 5:12 From Adam , in whom all have sinned , both guiltiness and death ( which is the punishment of the guiltiness ) came upon all . - Romans 5:12 By Adam , who is compared with Christ , like to him in this , that both of them make those who are theirs , partakers of that they have into : but they are unlike in this , that Adam deriveth sin into them that are his , even of nature , and that to death : but Christ maketh them that are his , partakers of his righteousness by grace , and that unto life . - Romans 5:12 By sin is meant that disease which is ours by inheritance , and men commonly call it original sin : for so he useth to call that sin in the singular number , whereas , if he speaks of the fruits of it , he useth the plural number , calling them sins . - Romans 5:12 That is , in Adam . - Romans 5:13 That this is so , that both guiltiness and death began not after the giving and transgressing of Moses ’ Law , it appeareth manifestly by that , that men died before that Law was given : for in that they died , sin , which is the cause of death , was then : and in such sort , that it was also imputeth : whereupon it followeth that there was then some Law , the breach whereof was the cause of death . - Romans 5:13 Even from Adam to Moses . - Romans 5:13 Where there is no Law made , no man is punished as faulty and guilty . - Romans 5:14 But that this Law was not that universal Law , and that death did not proceed from any actual sin of everyone particularly , it appeareth hereby , that the very infants which neither could ever know nor transgress that natural Law , are notwithstanding dead as well as Adam . - Romans 5:14 Our infants . - Romans 5:14 Not after that sort as they sin that are of more years , following their lusts : but yet the whole posterity was corrupt in Adam , when as he wittingly and willingly sinned . - Romans 5:14 Now the first Adam answereth the latter , who is Christ , as it is afterward declared . - Romans 5:15 Adam and Christ are compared together in this respect , that both of them do give and yield to theirs , that which is their own : but herein first they differ , that Adam by nature hath spread his fault to the destruction of many , but Christ ’ s obedience hath by grace overflowed many . - Romans 5:15 That is , Adam . - Romans 5:16 Another inequality consisteth in this , that by Adam ’ s one offense men are made guilty , but the righteousness of Christ imputed unto us freely , doth not only absolve us from that one fault , but from all others . - Romans 5:16 To the sentence of absolution , whereby we are quit , and pronounced righteous . - Romans 5:17 The third difference is , that the righteousness of Christ being imputed unto us by grace , is of greater power to bring life , than the offense of Adam is to addict his posterity to death . - Romans 5:17 Be partakers of true and everlasting life . - Romans 5:18 Therefore to be short , as by one man ’ s offense , the guiltiness came on all men , to make them subject to death : so on the contrary side , the righteousness of Christ , which by God ’ s mercy is imputed to all believers , justifieth them , that they may become partakers of everlasting life . - Romans 5:18 Not only because our sins are forgiven us , but also because the righteousness of Christ is imputed unto us . - Romans 5:19 The ground of this whole comparison is this , that these two men are set as two stocks or roots , so that out of the one , sin by nature , out of the other , righteousness by grace doth spring forth upon others . - Romans 5:19 So then , sin entered not into us only by following the steps of our forefather , but we take corruption of him by inheritance . - Romans 5:19 This word , Many , is set against this word , A few . - Romans 5:20 A preventing of an objection : why then did the Law of Moses enter thereupon ? that men might be so much the more guilty , and the benefit of God in Christ Jesus be so much the more glorious . - Romans 5:20 Beside that disease which all men were infected withall by being defiled with one man ’ s sin , the Law entered . - Romans 5:20 Grace was poured so plentifully from heaven , that it did not only countervail sin , but above measure passed it .

GNV	Romans	6	1	What [ a ] shall we say then ? Shall we continue still in [ b ] sin , that grace may abound ? God forbid .
GNV	Romans	6	4	( B ) We are buried then with him by baptism into his death , that like as Christ was raised up from the dead [ g ] to the glory of the Father , so [ h ] we also should ( C ) walk in newness of life .
GNV	Romans	6	12	[ s ] Let not sin [ t ] reign therefore in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof :
GNV	Romans	6	16	( E ) Know ye not , that to whomsoever ye give yourselves as servants to obey , his servants ye are to whom ye obey , whether it be of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
GNV	Romans	6	2	[ c ] How shall we , that are [ d ] dead to sin , live yet therein ?
GNV	Romans	6	3	[ e ] Know ye not , that ( A ) all we which have been baptized into [ f ] Jesus Christ , have been baptized into his death ?
GNV	Romans	6	5	( D ) [ i ] For if we be planted with him to the [ j ] similitude of his death , even so shall we [ k ] be to the similitude of his resurrection ,
GNV	Romans	6	7	[ p ] For he that is dead , is freed from sin .
GNV	Romans	6	8	Wherefore , if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall live also with him ,
GNV	Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead , dieth no more : death hath no more dominion over him .
GNV	Romans	6	10	For in that he died , he died [ q ] once to sin : but in that he liveth , he liveth to [ r ] God .
GNV	Romans	6	11	Likewise think ye also , that ye are dead to sin , but are alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord .
GNV	Romans	6	13	Neither [ u ] give ye your [ v ] members , as [ w ] weapons of unrighteousness unto sin : but give yourselves unto God , as they that are alive from the dead , and give your members as weapons of righteousness unto God .
GNV	Romans	6	14	[ x ] For sin shall not have dominion over you : for ye are not under the Law , but under grace .
GNV	Romans	6	15	[ y ] What then ? shall we sin , because we are not under the Law , but under grace ? God forbid .
GNV	Romans	6	17	[ z ] But God be thanked , that ye have been the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart unto the [ aa ] form of the doctrine , whereunto ye were delivered .
GNV	Romans	6	18	Being then made free from sin , ye are made the servants of righteousness .
GNV	Romans	6	19	I speak after the manner of man , because of the infirmity of your flesh : for as ye have given your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity , to commit iniquity , so now give your members servants unto righteousness in holiness .
GNV	Romans	6	20	For when ye were the servants of sin , ye were [ ab ] freed from righteousness .
GNV	Romans	6	21	[ ac ] What fruit had ye then in those things , whereof ye are now ashamed ? For the [ ad ] end of those things is death .
GNV	Romans	6	22	But now being freed from sin , and made servants unto God , ye have your fruit in holiness , and the end , everlasting life .
GNV	Romans	6	23	[ ae ] For the wages of sin is death : but the gift of God is eternal life , through Jesus Christ our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 6:1 He passeth now to another benefit of Christ , which is called sanctification or regeneration . - Romans 6:1 In that corruption : for though the guiltiness of sin be not imputed to us , yet the corruption remaineth still in us : the which Sanctification that followeth Justification killeth by little and little . - Romans 6:2 The benefits of Justification and Sanctification , are always joined together inseparably , and both of them proceed from Christ , by the grace of God : Now sanctification is the abolishing of sin , that is , of our natural corruption , into whose place succeedeth the cleanness and pureness of nature reformed . - Romans 6:2 They are said of Paul to be dead to sin , which are in such sort made partakers of the virtue of Christ , that that natural corruption is dead in them , that is , the force of it is put out , and it bringeth not forth his bitter fruits : and on the other side , they are said to live to sin , which are in the flesh , that is , whom the spirit of God hath not delivered from the slavery of the corruption of nature . - Romans 6:3 There are three parts of this Sanctification , to wit , the dead of the old man or sin , his burial , and the resurrection of the new man , descending into us from the virtue of the death , burial , and resurrection of Christ , of which benefit our baptism is the sign and pledge . - Romans 6:3 To the end that growing up in one with him , we should receive his strength to quench sin in us , and to make us new men . - Romans 6:4 That Christ himself being discharged of his infirmity and weakness , might live in glory with God forever . - Romans 6:4 And we which are his members rise for this end , that being made partakers of the selfsame virtue , we should begin to lead a new life , as though we were already in heaven . - Romans 6:5 The death of sin and the life of righteousness , or our ingrafting into Christ , and growing up into one with him , can not be separated by any means , neither in death nor life , whereby it followeth , that no man is sanctified , which lived still to sin , and therefore is no man made partaker of Christ by faith , which repenteth not , and turneth not from his wickedness : for as he said before , the Law is not subverted , but established by faith . - Romans 6:5 Insomuch as by the means of the strength which cometh from him to us , we so die to sin as he is dead . - Romans 6:5 For we become every day more perfect than others : for we shall never be perfectly sanctified , as long as we live here . - Romans 6:6 All our whole nature , as we are conceived and born into this world with sin , which is called old , partly by comparing that old Adam with Christ , and partly also in respect of the deformation of our corrupt nature , which we change with a new . - Romans 6:6 Our corrupt nature is attributed to Christ , not in deed , but by imputation . - Romans 6:6 That naughtiness which sticketh fast in us . - Romans 6:6 The end of sanctification which we shoot at , and shall at length come to , to wit when God shall be all in all . - Romans 6:7 He proveth it by the effects of death , using a comparison of Christ the head with his members . - Romans 6:10 Once for all . - Romans 6:10 With God . - Romans 6:12 An exhortation to contend and strive with corruption and all the effects thereof . - Romans 6:12 By reigning , Saint Paul meaneth that chiefest and high rule , which no man striveth against , and if any do , yet it is in vain . - Romans 6:13 To sin , as to a Lord or tyrant . - Romans 6:13 Your mind and all the powers of it . - Romans 6:13 As instruments to commit wickedness withall . - Romans 6:14 He granteth that sin is not yet so dead in us that it is utterly extinct : but he promised victory to them that contend manfully , because we have the grace of God given us which worketh so , that the Law is not now in us the power and instrument of sin . - Romans 6:15 To be under the law and under sin , signifiy all one , in respect of them which are not sanctified , as on the contrary side , to be under grace and righteousness , agree to them that are regenerate . Now these are contraries , so that one can not agree with the other : Therefore let righteousness expel sin . - Romans 6:17 By nature we are slaves to sin , and free from righteousness , but by the grace of God we are made servants to righteousness , and therefore free from sin . - Romans 6:17 This kind of speech hath a force in it : for he meaneth thereby that the doctrine of the Gospel is like a certain mold which we are cast into to be framed and fashioned like unto it . - Romans 6:20 Righteousness had no rule over you . - Romans 6:21 An exhortation to the study of righteousness and hatred of sin , the contrary ends of both , being set down before us . - Romans 6:21 The reward or payment . - Romans 6:23 Death is the punishment due to sin , but we are sanctified freely , unto life everlasting . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Romans	7	7	[ q ] What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? God forbid . Nay , I knew not sin , but by the Law : for I had not known [ r ] lust , except the Law had said , ( C ) Thou shalt not lust .

GNV	Romans	7	1	Know [ a ] ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the Law ) that the Law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth ?
GNV	Romans	7	2	( A ) For the woman which is in subjection to a man , is bound by the Law to the man , while he liveth : but if the man be dead , she is delivered from the Law of the man .
GNV	Romans	7	12	[ x ] Wherefore the Law is ( D ) holy , and that [ y ] commandment is holy , and just , and good .
GNV	Romans	7	14	[ ad ] For we know that the Law is spiritual , but I am carnal , sold under sin .
GNV	Romans	7	5	[ g ] For when we [ h ] were in the flesh , the [ i ] affections of sins , which were by the [ j ] law , had [ k ] force in our members , to bring forth fruit unto death ,
GNV	Romans	7	17	Now then , it is no more I , that do it , but [ ah ] sin that dwelleth in me .
GNV	Romans	7	21	[ ak ] I find then that when I would do good , I am thus yoked , that evil is present with me .
GNV	Romans	7	3	So then , if while the man liveth , she taketh another man , she shall be [ b ] called an ( B ) adulteress : but if the man be dead , she is free from the Law , so that she is not an adulteress , though she take another man .
GNV	Romans	7	4	[ c ] So ye , my brethren , are dead also to the Law by the [ d ] body of Christ , that ye should be unto another , even unto him that is raised up from the dead , that we should bring forth [ e ] fruit unto [ f ] God .
GNV	Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the Law , he [ l ] being dead [ m ] in whom we were [ n ] holden , that we should serve in [ o ] newness of Spirit , and not in the oldness of the [ p ] letter .
GNV	Romans	7	8	But sin took an occasion by the commandment , and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence : for without the Law sin is [ s ] dead .
GNV	Romans	7	9	[ t ] For I once was alive , without the [ u ] law : but when the commandment [ v ] came , sin revived ,
GNV	Romans	7	10	But I [ w ] died : and the same commandment which was ordained unto life , was found to be unto me unto death .
GNV	Romans	7	11	For sin took occasion by the commandment , and deceived me , and thereby slew me .
GNV	Romans	7	13	[ z ] Was that then which is good , [ aa ] made death unto me ? God forbid : but sin , that it might [ ab ] appear sin , wrought death in me by that which is good , that sin might be [ ac ] out of measure sinful by the commandment .
GNV	Romans	7	15	[ ae ] For I [ af ] allow not that which I do : for what I [ ag ] would , that do I not : but what I hate , that do I .
GNV	Romans	7	16	If I do then that which I would not , I consent to the Law , that it is good .
GNV	Romans	7	18	[ ai ] For I know , that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me : but I find [ aj ] no means to perform that which is good ,
GNV	Romans	7	19	For I do not the good thing , which I would , but the evil , which I would not , that do I .
GNV	Romans	7	20	Now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but the sin that dwelleth in me .
GNV	Romans	7	22	For I delight in the Law of God , concerning the [ al ] inner man .
GNV	Romans	7	23	But I see another Law in my members , rebelling against the law of my [ am ] mind , and leading me captive unto the law of sin , which is in my members .
GNV	Romans	7	24	[ an ] O [ ao ] wretched man that I am , who shall deliver me from the body of this death !
GNV	Romans	7	25	I [ ap ] thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord . Then I [ aq ] myself in my mind serve the Law of God , but in my flesh the law of sin . Footnotes - Romans 7:1 By propounding the similitude of a marriage , he compareth the state of man both before and after regeneration together . The law of matrimony , saith he , is this , that so long as the husband liveth , the marriage abideth in force , but if he be dead , the woman may marry again . - Romans 7:3 That is , she shall be an adulteress , by the consent and judgment of all men . - Romans 7:4 An application of the similitude thus . So , saith he , doth it fare with us : for now we are joined to the spirit as it were to the second husband , by whom we must bring forth new children : we are dead in respect of the first husband , but in respect of the latter we are as it were raised from the dead . - Romans 7:4 That is , in the body of Christ , to give us to understand how straight and near that fellowship is betwixt Christ and his members . - Romans 7:4 He calleth the children , which the wife hath by her husband , fruit . - Romans 7:4 Which are acceptable to God . - Romans 7:5 A declaration of the former saying : for the concupiscences ( saith he ) which the law stirred up in us , were in us as it were an husband , of whom we brought forth very deadly and cursed children . But now since that husband is dead , and so consequently being delivered from the force of that killing law , we have passed into the governance of the spirit , so that we bring forth now , not those rotten and dead , but lively children . - Romans 7:5 When we were in the state of the first marriage , which he calleth in the next verse following the oldness of the letter . - Romans 7:5 The motions that egged us to sin , which show their force even in our minds . - Romans 7:5 He saith not , of the law , but by the law , because they spring of sin which dwelleth within us , and take occasion to work thus in us , by reason of the restraint that the law maketh , not that the fault is in the law , but in ourselves . - Romans 7:5 Wrought their strength . - Romans 7:6 As if he said , The bond which bound us , is dead , and vanished away , insomuch , that sin which held us , hath not now wherewith to hold us . - Romans 7:6 For this husband is within us . - Romans 7:6 Satan is an unjust possessor , for he brought us in bondage of sin and himself deceitfully : and yet notwithstanding so long as we are sinners , we sin willingly . - Romans 7:6 As becometh them , which after the death of their old husband are joined to the spirit : as whom the spirit of God hath made new men . - Romans 7:6 By the letter he meaneth the law , in respect of that old condition : for before that our will be framed by the holy Ghost , the law speaketh but to deaf men , and therefore it is dumb and dead to us , as touching the fulfilling of it . - Romans 7:7 An objection : what then ? are the law and sin all one , and do they agree together ? nay , saith he : Sin is reproved and condemned by the law . But because sin can not abide to be reproved , and was not in a manner felt until it was provoked and stirred up by the law , it taketh occasion thereby to be more outrageous , and yet by no fault of the law . - Romans 7:7 By the word , Lust , in this place he meaneth not evil lusts themselves , but the fountain from whence they spring : for the very heathen philosophers themselves condemned wicked lusts , though somewhat darkly , but as for the fountain of them , they could not so much as suspect it , and yet it is the very seat of the natural and unclean spot and filth . - Romans 7:8 Though sin be in us , yet it is not known for sin , neither doth it so rage , as it rageth after that the law is known . - Romans 7:9 He setteth himself before us for an example , in whom all men may behold , first what they are of nature before they earnestly think upon the law of God : to wit , blockish , and ready to sin and wickedness , without all true sense and feeling of sin , then what manner of persons they become , when their conscience is reproved by the testimony of the law , to wit , stubborn , and more inflamed with the desire of sin , than ever they were before . - Romans 7:9 When I knew not the law , then me thought I lived in deed : for my conscience never troubled me , because it knew not my disease . - Romans 7:9 When I began to understand the commandment . - Romans 7:10 In sin , or by sin . - Romans 7:12 The conclusion : That the law of itself is holy , but all the fault is in us which abuse the law . - Romans 7:12 Touching not coveting . - Romans 7:13 The proposition : That the Law is not the cause of death , but our corrupt nature , being therewith not only discovered , but also stirred up , and took occasion thereby to rebel , as which , the more that things are forbidden it , the more it desireth them , and from hence cometh guiltiness , and occasion of death . - Romans 7:13 Beareth it the blame of my death ? - Romans 7:13 That sin might show itself to be sin , and bewray itself to be that , which is in deed . - Romans 7:13 As evil as it could , showing all the venom it could . - Romans 7:14 The cause of this matter , is this : Because that the Law requireth a heavenly pureness , but men , such as they be born , are bondslaves of corruption , which they willingly serve . - Romans 7:15 He setteth himself , being regenerate , before us , for an example , in whom may easily appear the strife of the Spirit and the flesh , and therefore of the Law of God , and our wickedness . For since that the Law in a man not regenerate bringeth forth death only , therefore in him it may easily be accused : but seeing that in a man which is regenerate , it bringeth forth good fruit , it doth better appear that evil actions proceed not from the Law , but from sin , that is , from our corrupt nature : And therefore the Apostle teacheth also , what the true use of the Law is , in reproving sin in the regenerate , unto the end of the chapter , as a little before ( to wit , from the seventh verse unto this fifteenth ) he declared the use of it in them which are not regenerate . - Romans 7:15 The deeds of my life , saith he , answer not , nay they are contrary to my will : Therefore by the consent of my will with the Law , and repugnancy with the deeds of my life , it appeareth evidently , that the Law and a right ruled do persuade one thing , but corruption which hath her seat also in the regenerate , another thing . - Romans 7:15 It is to be noted , that one selfsame man is said to will and not to will , in divers respects : to wit , he is said to will , in that , that he is regenerate by grace : and not to will , in that , that he is not regenerate , or in that , that he is such an one as he was born . But because the part which is regenerate , at length becometh conqueror , therefore Paul sustaining the part of the regenerate , speaketh in such sort as if the corruption which sinneth willingly , were something without a man : although afterward he granteth that this evil is in his flesh , or in his members . - Romans 7:17 That natural corruption , which cleaveth fast even to them that are regenerate , and not clean conquered . - Romans 7:18 This vice , or sin , or law of sin , doth wholly possess those men which are not regenerate , and hindereth them or holdeth them back that are regenerate . - Romans 7:18 This doth indeed agree to that man , whom the grace of God hath made a new man : for where the Spirit is not , how can there be any strife there . - Romans 7:21 The conclusion : As the Law of God exhorteth to goodness , so doth the Law of sin ( that is , the corruption wherein we are born ) force us to wickedness : but the Spirit , that is , our mind , in that that it is regenerate , consenteth with the Law of God : but the flesh , that is , the whole natural man , is bondslave to the Law of sin . Therefore to be short , wickedness and death are not of the Law , but of sin , which reigneth in them that are not regenerate : for they neither will , nor do good , but will , and do evil : But in them that are regenerate , it striveth against the Spirit or law of the mind , so that they can not either live so well as they would , or be so void of sin as they would . - Romans 7:22 The inner man , and the new man are all one , and are answerable and set as contrary to the old man : neither doth this word , Inner man , signify man ’ s mind and reason , and the old man , the powers that are under them , as the Philosophers imagine , but by the outward man is meant whatsoever is either without or within a man , from top to toe , so long as that man is not born anew by the grace of God . - Romans 7:23 The law of the mind in this place , is not to be understood of the mind as it is naturally , and as our mind is from our birth , but of the mind which is renewed by the Spirit of God . - Romans 7:24 It is a miserable thing to be yet in part subject to sin , which of its own nature maketh us guilty of death : but we must cry to the Lord , who will by death itself at length make us conquerors as we are already conquerors in Christ . - Romans 7:24 Wearied with miserable and continual conflict . - Romans 7:25 He recovereth himself , and showeth us that he resteth only in Christ . - Romans 7:25 This is the true perfection of them that are born anew , to confess that they are imperfect .

GNV	Romans	8	1	Now [ a ] then there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus , which [ b ] walk not after the [ c ] flesh , but after the Spirit .
GNV	Romans	8	3	[ i ] For ( that that was [ j ] impossible to the Law , inasmuch as it was weak , because of the [ k ] flesh ) God sending his own Son , in the similitude of [ l ] sinful flesh , and for [ m ] sin , [ n ] condemned sin in the flesh ,
GNV	Romans	8	9	[ w ] Now ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , because the spirit of God dwelleth in you : but if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ , the same is not his .
GNV	Romans	8	14	[ ad ] For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
GNV	Romans	8	15	[ ae ] For ye have not received the [ af ] Spirit of bondage , to [ ag ] fear again : but ye have received the Spirit of [ ah ] adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father .
GNV	Romans	8	28	[ bf ] Also we know that [ bg ] all things work together for the best unto them that love God , even to them that are called of his [ bh ] purpose .
GNV	Romans	8	2	[ d ] For the [ e ] Law of the Spirit of [ f ] life which is in [ g ] Christ Jesus , hath [ h ] freed me from the Law of sin and of death .
GNV	Romans	8	4	That that [ o ] righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled [ p ] in us , which walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
GNV	Romans	8	5	[ q ] For they that are after the [ r ] flesh , savor the things of the flesh : but they that are after the Spirit , the things of the Spirit .
GNV	Romans	8	6	[ s ] For the wisdom of the flesh is death : but the wisdom of the Spirit is life and peace ,
GNV	Romans	8	7	[ t ] Because the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God : [ u ] for it is not subject to the Law of God , neither indeed can be .
GNV	Romans	8	10	[ x ] And if Christ be in you , the [ y ] body is dead , because of sin : but the Spirit is life for righteousness sake .
GNV	Romans	8	11	[ z ] But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead , dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead , shall also quicken your mortal bodies , by his Spirit that [ aa ] dwelleth in you .
GNV	Romans	8	12	[ ab ] Therefore brethren , we are debtors not to the flesh , to live after the flesh :
GNV	Romans	8	13	[ ac ] For if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye mortify the deeds of the body by the Spirit , ye shall live .
GNV	Romans	8	16	The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God .
GNV	Romans	8	17	[ ai ] If we be children , we are also [ aj ] heirs , even the heirs of God , and heirs annexed with Christ : [ ak ] if so be that we suffer with him , that we may also be glorified with him .
GNV	Romans	8	18	[ al ] For I [ am ] count that the afflictions of this present time are not worthy of the glory , which shall be showed unto us .
GNV	Romans	8	19	[ an ] For the fervent desire of the [ ao ] creature waiteth when the sons of God shall be revealed ,
GNV	Romans	8	20	Because the creature is subject to [ ap ] vanity , not of its [ aq ] own will , but by reason [ ar ] of him , which hath subdued it under [ as ] hope ,
GNV	Romans	8	21	Because the creature also shall be delivered from the [ at ] bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God .
GNV	Romans	8	22	For we know that every creature groaneth with us also , and [ au ] travaileth in pain together unto this present .
GNV	Romans	8	23	[ av ] And not only the creature , but we also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we do sigh in [ aw ] ourselves , waiting for the adoption , even [ ax ] ( A ) the redemption of our body .
GNV	Romans	8	24	[ ay ] For we are saved by hope : but [ az ] hope that is seen , is not hope : for how can a man hope for that which he seeth ?
GNV	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that we see not , we do with patience abide for it .
GNV	Romans	8	26	[ ba ] Likewise the Spirit also [ bb ] helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what to pray as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh [ bc ] request for us with sighs , which can not be expressed .
GNV	Romans	8	27	But he that searcheth the hearts , knoweth what is the [ bd ] meaning of the Spirit : for he maketh request for the Saints , [ be ] according to the will of God .
GNV	Romans	8	29	For those which he knew before , he also predestinated to be made like to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
GNV	Romans	8	30	Moreover , whom he [ bi ] predestinated , them also he called , and whom he called , them also he justified , and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
GNV	Romans	8	31	[ bj ] What shall we then say to these things ? If God be on our side , who can be against us ?
GNV	Romans	8	32	Who spared not his own Son , but gave him for us all to death , how shall he not with him [ bk ] give us all things also ?
GNV	Romans	8	33	[ bl ] Who shall lay anything to the charge of God ’ s chosen ? it is [ bm ] God that justifieth .
GNV	Romans	8	34	Who shall condemn ? it is Christ which is dead : yea , or rather , which is risen again , who is also at the right hand of God , and maketh request also for us .
GNV	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of [ bn ] Christ ? shall tribulation or anguish , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
GNV	Romans	8	36	As it is written , ( B ) For thy sake are we killed all day long : we are counted as sheep for the slaughter :
GNV	Romans	8	37	[ bo ] Nevertheless , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
GNV	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded that neither death , nor life , nor Angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
GNV	Romans	8	39	Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 8:1 A conclusion of all the former disputation from Rom 1:16 even to this place : Seeing that we being justified by faith in Christ , do obtain remission of sins and imputation of righteousness , and are also sanctified , it followeth hereof , that they that are grafted into Christ by faith , are out of all fear of condemnation . - Romans 8:1 The fruits of the Spirit , or effects of sanctification , which is begun in us , do not ingraft us into Christ , but do declare that we are grafted into him . - Romans 8:1 Follow not the flesh for their guide : for he is not said to live after the flesh , that hath the holy Ghost for his guide , though sometimes he step away . - Romans 8:2 A preventing of an objection : seeing that the virtue of the spirit which is in us , is so weak , how may we gather thereby , that there is no condemnation to them that have that virtue ? because saith he , that virtue of the quickening spirit which is so weak in us , is most perfect and most mighty in Christ , and being imputed unto us which believe , causeth us to be so accounted of , as though there were no relics of corruption , and death in us . Therefore hitherto Paul disputed of remission of sins , and imputation of fulfilling the Law , and also of sanctification which is begun in us : but now he speaketh of the perfect imputation of Christ ’ s manhood , which part was necessarily required to the full appeasing of our consciences : for our sins are defaced by the blood of Christ , and the guiltiness of our corruption is covered with the imputation of Christ ’ s obedience : and the corruption itself ( which the Apostle calleth sinful sin ) is healed in us by little and little , by the gift of sanctification , but yet it lacketh besides that another remedy , to wit , the perfect sanctification of Christ ’ s own flesh , which also is to us imputed . - Romans 8:2 The power and authority of the spirit , against which is set the tyranny of sin . - Romans 8:2 Which mortifieth the old man , and quickeneth the new man . - Romans 8:2 To wit , absolutely and perfectly . - Romans 8:2 For Christ ’ s sanctification being imputed unto us , perfecteth our sanctification which is begun in us . - Romans 8:3 He useth no argument here , but expoundeth the mystery of sanctification , which is imputed unto us : for because , that the virtue of the law was not such ( and that by reason of the corruption of our nature ) that it could make man pure and perfect : and for that it rather kindled the disease of sin , than did put it out and extinguish it , therefore God clothed his Son with flesh like unto our sinful flesh , wherein he utterly abolished our corruption , that being accounted thoroughly pure and without fault in him apprehended and laid hold on by faith , we might be found to have fully that singular perfection which the Law requireth , and therefore that there might be no condemnation in us . - Romans 8:3 Which is not proper to the Law , but cometh by our fault . - Romans 8:3 In man not born anew , whose disease the law could not heal it . - Romans 8:3 Of man ’ s nature which was corrupt through sin , until he sanctified it . - Romans 8:3 To abolish sin in our flesh . - Romans 8:3 Showed that sin hath no right in us . - Romans 8:4 The very substance of the law of God might be fulfilled , or that same which the law requireth , that we may be found just before God : for if with our justification there be joined that sanctification which is imputed to us , we are just , according to the perfect form which the Lord requireth . - Romans 8:4 He returneth to that which he said , that the sanctification which is begun in us , is a sure testimony of our ingrafting into Christ , which is a most plentiful fruit of a godly and honest life . - Romans 8:5 A reason why to walk after the flesh , agreeth not to them which are grafted in Christ , but to walk after the spirit agreeth and is meet for them : because , saith he , that they which are after the flesh , savor the things of the flesh , but they that are after the spirit , the things of the spirit . - Romans 8:5 They that live as the flesh leadeth them . - Romans 8:6 He proveth the consequent : because that whatsoever the flesh savoreth , that engendereth death : and whatsoever the spirit savoreth , that tendeth to joy and life everlasting . - Romans 8:7 A reason and proof , why the wisdom of the flesh is death : because , saith he , it is the enemy of God . - Romans 8:7 A reason why the wisdom of the flesh is enemy to God : because it neither will neither can be subject to him . And by flesh he meaneth a man not regenerate . - Romans 8:8 The conclusion : therefore they that walk after the flesh , can not please God : whereby it followeth , that they are not ingrafted into Christ . - Romans 8:9 He cometh to the others , to wit , to them which walk after the spirit , of whom we have to understand contrary things to the former : and first of all he defineth what it is to be in the spirit , or to be sanctified : to wit , to have the spirit of God dwelling in us ; then he declareth , that sanctification is so joined and knit to our grafting in Christ , that it can by no means be separated . - Romans 8:10 He confirmeth the faithful against the relics of flesh and sin , granting that they are yet ( as appeareth by the corruption which is in them ) touching one of their parts ( which he calleth the body , that is to say , a lump ) which is not yet purged from the earthly filthiness in death : but therewithall willing them to doubt nothing of the happy success of their combat , because that even the little spark of the Spirit , ( that is , of the grace of regeneration ) which appeareth to be in them by the fruits of righteousness , is the seed of life . - Romans 8:10 The flesh , or all that which as yet sticketh fast in the clefts of sin , and death . - Romans 8:11 A confirmation of the former sentence . You have the selfsame Spirit , which Christ hath : Therefore at length it shall die the same in you , that it did in Christ , to wit , when all infirmities being utterly laid aside , and death overcome , it shall clothe you with heavenly glory . - Romans 8:11 By the virtue and power of it , which showed the same might first in our head , and daily worketh in his members . - Romans 8:12 An exhortation to oppress the flesh daily more and more by the virtue of the Spirit of regeneration , because ( saith he ) you are debtors unto God , forsomuch as you have received so many benefits of him . - Romans 8:13 Another reason of the profit that ensueth : for such as strive and fight valiantly , shall have everlasting life . - Romans 8:14 A confirmation of this reason : they be the children of God , which are governed by his Spirit , therefore shall they have life everlasting . - Romans 8:15 He declareth and expoundeth by the way , in these two verses , by what right this name , to be called the children of God , is given to the believers : because saith he , they have received the grace of the Gospel , wherein God showeth himself , not ( as before in the publishing of the Law ) terrible and fearful , but a most benign and loving father in Christ , so that with great boldness we call him Father , that holy Ghost sealing this adoption in our hearts by faith . - Romans 8:15 By the Spirit is meant the holy Ghost , whom we are said to receive , when he worketh in our minds . - Romans 8:15 Which fear is stirred up in our minds , by the preaching of the Law . - Romans 8:15 Which sealeth our adoption in our minds , and therefore openeth our mouths . - Romans 8:17 A proof of the consequent of the confirmation : because that he which is the Son of God , doth enjoy God with Christ . - Romans 8:17 Partakers of our father ’ s goods , and that freely , because we are children by adoption . - Romans 8:17 Now Paul teacheth by what way the sons of God do come to that felicity , to wit , by the cross , as Christ himself did : and therewithall openeth unto them fountains of comfort : as first , that we have Christ a companion and fellow of our afflictions : secondly , that we shall be also his followers in that everlasting glory . - Romans 8:18 Thirdly that this glory which we look for , doth a thousand parts surmount the misery of our afflictions . - Romans 8:18 All being well considered , I gather . - Romans 8:19 Fourthly , he plainly teacheth us that we shall certainly be renewed from that confusion and horrible deformation of the whole world , which can not be continual , as it was not at the beginning : But as it had a beginning by the sin of man , for whom it was made by the ordinance of God , so shall it at length be restored with the elect . - Romans 8:19 All this world . - Romans 8:20 Is subject to a vanishing and flitting state . - Romans 8:20 Not by their natural inclination . - Romans 8:20 That they should obey the Creator ’ s commandment , whom it pleased to show by their fickle estate , how greatly he was displeased with man . - Romans 8:20 God would not make the world subject to everlasting curse , for the sin of man , but gave it hope that it should be restored . - Romans 8:21 From the corruption which they are now subject to , they shall be delivered and changed into that blessed state of incorruption , which shall be revealed when the sons of God shall be advanced to glory . - Romans 8:22 By this word is meant , not only exceeding sorrow , but also the fruit that followeth of it . - Romans 8:23 Fifthly , if the rest of the world looks for a restoring , groaning as it were for it , and that not in vain , let it not grieve us also to sigh , yea , let us be more certainly persuaded of our redemption to come , forasmuch as we have the firstfruits of the Spirit . - Romans 8:23 Even from the bottom of our hearts . - Romans 8:23 That last restoring , which shall be the accomplishment of our adoption . - Romans 8:24 Sixthly , hope is necessarily joined with faith : seeing then that we believe those things , which we are not yet in possession of , and hope respected not the thing that is present , we must therefore hope and patiently wait for that which we believe shall come to pass . - Romans 8:24 This is spoken by the figure Metonymy : Hope , for that which is hoped for . - Romans 8:26 Seventhly , There is no cause why we should faint under the burden of afflictions , seeing that prayers minister unto us a most sure help , which can not be frustrated , seeing they proceed from the spirit of God which dwelleth in us . - Romans 8:26 Beareth our burden , as it were that we faint not under it . - Romans 8:26 Provoketh us to prayers , and telleth us as it were within , what we shall say , and how we shall groan . - Romans 8:27 What sobs and sighs proceed from the instinct of his Spirit . - Romans 8:27 Because he teacheth the godly to pray according to God ’ s will . - Romans 8:28 Eighthly , we are not afflicted , either by chance or to our harm , but by God ’ s providence for our great profit , who as he chose us from the beginning , so hath he predestined us to be made like to the image of his Son : and therefore will bring us in his time , being called and justified , to glory , by the cross . - Romans 8:28 Not only afflictions , but whatsoever else . - Romans 8:28 He calleth that , Purpose , which God hath from everlasting appointed with himself according to his good will and pleasure . - Romans 8:30 He useth the time past , for the time present , as the Hebrews use , who sometimes set down the thing that is to come , by the time that is past , to signify the certainty of it : and he hath also regard to God ’ s continual working . - Romans 8:31 Ninethly , we have no cause to fear that the Lord will not give us whatsoever is profitable for us , seeing that he hath not spared his own Son to save us . - Romans 8:32 Give us freely . - Romans 8:33 A most glorious and comfortable conclusion of the whole second part of this Epistle , that is , of the treatise of justification . There are no accusers that we have need to be afraid of before God , seeing that God himself absolveth us as just : and therefore much less need we to fear damnation , seeing that we rest upon the death and resurrection , the almighty power and defense of Jesus Christ . Therefore what can there be so weighty in this life , or of so great force and power , that might seize us , as though we might fall from the love of God , wherewith he loveth us in Christ : Surely nothing . Seeing that it is in itself most constant and sure , and also in us being confirmed by steadfast faith . - Romans 8:33 Who pronounceth us not only guiltless , but also perfectly just in his Son . - Romans 8:35 Wherewith Christ loveth us . - Romans 8:37 We are not only not overcome with so great and many miseries and calamities , but also more than conquerors in all of them .

GNV	Romans	9	1	I say [ a ] the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience bearing me witness in the holy Ghost ,
GNV	Romans	9	7	Neither are they all children , because they are the seed of Abraham : ( C ) [ l ] but , In [ m ] Isaac shall thy seed be called :
GNV	Romans	9	15	[ x ] For he saith to Moses , ( I ) I will [ y ] have mercy on him , to whom I will show mercy : and will have [ z ] compassion on him , on who I will have compassion .
GNV	Romans	9	20	[ aj ] But , O man , who art thou which pleadest against God ? [ ak ] shall the ( K ) thing [ al ] formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
GNV	Romans	9	24	[ au ] Even us whom he hath called , not of the [ av ] Jews only , but also of the Gentiles .
GNV	Romans	9	30	[ bb ] What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles which followed [ bc ] not righteousness , have attained unto righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
GNV	Romans	9	31	[ bd ] But Israel which followed the Law of righteousness , could not attain unto the Law of righteousness .
GNV	Romans	9	25	[ aw ] As he saith also in Hosea , ( M ) I will call them , My people , which were not my people : and her , Beloved , which was not beloved .
GNV	Romans	9	27	[ ax ] Also Isaiah crieth concerning Israel , ( O ) Though the number of the children of Israel were as the sand of the sea , yet shall but a remnant be saved .
GNV	Romans	9	2	That I have great heaviness , and continual sorrow in mine heart .
GNV	Romans	9	3	For I would wish myself to be [ b ] separate from Christ , for my brethren that are my kinsmen according to the [ c ] flesh ,
GNV	Romans	9	4	Which are the Israelites , to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the [ d ] glory , and the ( A ) [ e ] Covenants , and the giving of the [ f ] Law , and the [ g ] service of God , and the [ h ] promises .
GNV	Romans	9	5	Of whom are the fathers , and of whom concerning the flesh , Christ came , who is [ i ] God over all , blessed forever , Amen .
GNV	Romans	9	6	( B ) [ j ] Notwithstanding it can not be that the word of God should take none effect : for all they are not [ k ] Israel , which are of Israel :
GNV	Romans	9	8	[ n ] That is , they which are the children of the [ o ] flesh , are not the children of God : but the ( D ) children of the [ p ] promise , are counted for the seed .
GNV	Romans	9	10	[ r ] Neither he only felt this , but also ( F ) Rebecca , when she had conceived by one , even by our father Isaac .
GNV	Romans	9	11	For ere the children were born , and when they had neither done good nor evil ( that the [ s ] purpose of God might [ t ] remain according to election , not by works , but by him that calleth . )
GNV	Romans	9	12	[ u ] It was said unto her , ( G ) The Elder shall serve the younger .
GNV	Romans	9	13	As it is written , ( H ) I have loved Jacob , and have hated Esau .
GNV	Romans	9	14	[ v ] What shall we say then ? Is there [ w ] unrighteousness with God ? God forbid .
GNV	Romans	9	16	[ aa ] So then it is not in him that [ ab ] willeth , nor in him that runneth , but in God that showeth mercy .
GNV	Romans	9	17	[ ac ] For the [ ad ] Scripture saith unto Pharaoh , ( J ) For this same purpose have [ ae ] I stirred thee up , that I might [ af ] show my power in thee , and that my Name might be declared throughout all the earth .
GNV	Romans	9	18	[ ag ] Therefore he hath mercy on whom he [ ah ] will , and whom he will he hardeneth .
GNV	Romans	9	19	[ ai ] Thou wilt say then unto me , Why doth he yet complain ? for who hath resisted his will ?
GNV	Romans	9	21	( L ) [ am ] Hath not the potter power of the clay to make of the same lump one [ an ] vessel to [ ao ] honor , and another unto [ ap ] dishonor ?
GNV	Romans	9	22	[ aq ] What and if God would , to show his wrath , and to make his power known , suffer with long patience the [ ar ] vessels of wrath , prepared to [ as ] destruction ?
GNV	Romans	9	23	And that he might declare the [ at ] riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy , which he hath prepared unto glory ?
GNV	Romans	9	26	And it shall be in the place where it was said unto them , ( N ) Ye are not my people , that there they shall be called , The children of the living God .
GNV	Romans	9	28	For he will make his account , and gather it into a [ ay ] short sum with righteousness : for the Lord will make a short count in the earth .
GNV	Romans	9	29	( P ) And as Isaiah said before , Except the Lord of [ az ] hosts had left us a [ ba ] seed , we had been made as Sodom , and had been like to Gomorrah .
GNV	Romans	9	32	Wherefore ? Because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the [ be ] works of the Law : for they have stumbled at the stumbling stone ,
GNV	Romans	9	33	As it is written , ( Q ) Behold , I lay in Zion a stumbling stone , and a rock to make men fall : and everyone that believeth in him , shall not be ashamed . Footnotes - Romans 9:1 The third part of this Epistle , even to the twelfth Chapter , wherein Paul ascendeth to the higher causes of faith : and first of all because he purposed to speak much of the casting off of the Jews , he useth an insinuation , declaring by a double or triple oath , and by witnessing of his great desire towards their salvation , his singular love towards them , and therewithall granting unto them all their prerogatives . - Romans 9:3 The Apostle loved his brethren so entirely , that if it have been possible he would have been ready to have redeemed the casting away of the Israelites , with the loss of his own soul forever : for this word separate , betokeneth as much in this place . - Romans 9:3 Being brethren by flesh , as of one nation and country . - Romans 9:4 The ark of the covenant , which was a token of God ’ s presence . - Romans 9:4 The tables of the covenant : and this is spoken by the figure Metonymy . - Romans 9:4 Of the judicial Law . - Romans 9:4 The ceremonial Law . - Romans 9:4 Which were made to Abraham and to his posterity . - Romans 9:5 A most manifest testimony of the Godhead and divinity of Christ . - Romans 9:6 He entereth into the handling of predestination by a kind of preventing an objection : How may it be , that Israel is cast off , but that therewithall we must also make the covenant which God made with Abraham and his seed , frustrate and void ? He answereth therefore , that God ’ s word is true , although that Israel be cast off : for the election of the people of Israel is so general and common , that notwithstanding the same , God chooseth by his secret counsel , such as it pleaseth him . So then this is the proposition and state of this Treatise : The grace of salvation is offered generally in such sort , that notwithstanding it , the efficacy thereof pertaineth only to the elect . - Romans 9:6 Israel in the first place , is taken for Jacob : and in the second , for the Israelites . - Romans 9:7 The first proof is taken from the example of Abraham ’ s own house , wherein Isaac only was counted the son , and that by God ’ s ordinance : although that Ishmael also was born of Abraham , and circumcised before Isaac . - Romans 9:7 Isaac shall be thy true and natural son , and therefore heir of thy blessing . - Romans 9:8 A general application of the former proof or example . - Romans 9:8 Which are born of Abraham by the course of nature . - Romans 9:8 Which are born by virtue of the promise . - Romans 9:9 A reason of that application : Because that Isaac was born by the virtue of the promise , and therefore he was not chosen , nay he was not at all , but by the free will of God : whereby it followeth that the promise is the fountain of predestination , and not the flesh from which promise the particular election proceedeth : that is , that the elect be born elect : and not that they be first born and then afterward elected , in respect of God who doth predestinate . - Romans 9:10 Another forcible proof , taken from the example of Esau and Jacob , which were both born of the same Isaac , which was the son of promise , of one mother , and at one birth , and not at divers as Ishmael and Isaac were : and yet notwithstanding , Esau being cast off , only Jacob was chosen : and that before their birth , that neither any goodness of Jacob ’ s might be thought to be the cause of his election , neither any wickedness of Esau , of his casting away . - Romans 9:11 God ’ s decree , which proceedeth of his mere good will , whereby it pleased him to choose one , and refuse the other . - Romans 9:11 Paul saith not , might be made , but being made , might remain . Therefore they are deceived which make foreseen faith the cause of election , and foreknown infidelity , the cause of reprobation . - Romans 9:12 He proveth the casting away of Esau by that , that he was made servant to his brother : and proveth the choosing of Jacob by that that he was made Lord of his brother , although his brother were the first begotten . And lest that any man might take this saying of God , and refer it to external things , the Apostle showeth out of Malachi , who is a good interpreter of Moses , that the servitude of Esau was joined with the hatred of God , and the Lordship of Jacob with the love of God . - Romans 9:14 The first objection : If God doth love or hate upon no consideration of worthiness or unworthiness , then [ is ] he unjust , because he may love them which are unworthy , and hate them that are worthy . The Apostle detesteth this blasphemy , and afterward answereth it severally , point by point . - Romans 9:14 Man ’ s will knoweth no other causes of love or hatred , but those that are in the persons , and thereupon this objection riseth . - Romans 9:15 He answereth first touching them which are chosen to salvation in choosing of whom , he denieth that God may seem unjust , although he choose and predestinate to salvation , them that are not yet born , without any respect of worthiness : because he bringeth not the chosen to the appointed end , but by the means of his mercy , which is a cause next under predestination . Now mercy presupposeth misery , and again misery presupposeth sin or voluntary corruption of mankind , and corruption presupposeth a pure and perfect creation . Moreover mercy is showed by her degrees : to wit , by calling , by faith , by justification and sanctification , so that at length we come to glorification , as the Apostle will show afterward . Now all these things , orderly following the purpose of God , do clearly prove that he can by no means seem unjust in loving and saving his . - Romans 9:15 I will be merciful and favorable to whom I list to be favorable . - Romans 9:15 I will have compassion on whomsoever I list to have compassion . - Romans 9:16 The conclusion of the answer : Therefore God is not unjust in choosing and saving of his free goodness , such as it pleaseth him : as he also answered Moses , when he prayed for all the people . - Romans 9:16 By will , he meaneth the thought and endeavor of heart , and by running , good works : to neither of which he giveth the praise , but only to the mercy of God . - Romans 9:17 Now he answereth concerning the reprobate or them whom God hateth being not yet born , and hath appointed to destruction , without any respect of unworthiness . And first of all he proveth this to be true , by alleging the testimony of God himself touching Pharaoh , whom he stirred up to this purpose , that he might be glorified in his hardening and just punishing . - Romans 9:17 God so speaketh unto Pharaoh in the Scripture , or , the Scripture bringeth in God , so speaking to Pharaoh , Exodus 9:16 . - Romans 9:17 Brought thee into this world . - Romans 9:17 Secondly , he bringeth the end of God ’ s counsel , to show that there is no unrighteousness in him . Now this chiefest end , is not properly and simply the destruction of the wicked , but God ’ s glory which appeareth in their rightful punishment . - Romans 9:18 A conclusion of the full answer to the first objection : therefore seeing that God doth not save them whom he freely chose according to his good will and pleasure , but by justifying and sanctifying them by his grace , his counsel in saving them can not seem unjust . And again , there is not injustice in the everlasting counsel of God touching the destruction of them whom he listeth to destroy , for that he hardeneth before he destroyeth : Therefore the third answer for the maintenance of God ’ s justice is the everlasting counsel of reprobation , consisteth in this word Hardening : which notwithstanding he concealed in the former verse , because the History of Pharaoh was well known . But the force of the word is great : for Hardening , which is set against Mercy , presupposeth the same things that mercy did , to wit , a voluntary corruption , wherein the reprobate are hardened : and again corruption presupposeth a perfect state of creation . Moreover , this hardening also is voluntary , for God so hardeneth being offended with corruption , that he useth their own will whom he hardeneth , to the executing of that judgment . Then follow the fruits of Hardening , to wit , unbelief and sin , which are the true and proper causes of the condemnation of the reprobate . Why doth he then appoint to destruction ? because he will : why doth he harden ? because they are corrupt : why doth he condemn ? because they are sinners . Where is then unrighteousness ? Nay , if he should destroy all after this same sort , to whom should he do injury ? - Romans 9:18 Whom it pleased him to appoint , to show his favor upon . - Romans 9:19 Another objection but only for the reprobate , rising upon the former answer . If God do appoint to everlasting destruction , such as he listeth , and if that can not be hindered notwithstanded that he hath once decreed , how doth he justly condemn them , which perish by his will ? - Romans 9:20 The Apostle doth not answer that it is not God ’ s will , or that God doth not either reject or elect according to his pleasure , which thing the wicked call blasphemy , but he rather granteth , his adversary both the antecedents , to wit , that it is God ’ s will , and that it must of necessity so fall out , yet he denieth that God is therefore to be thought an unjust revenger of the wicked : for seeing it appeareth by manifest proof that this is the will of God and his doing , what impudency is it for man , which is but dust and ashes to dispute with God , and as it were to call him into judgment ? Now if any man say that the doubt is not so dissolved and answered , I answer , that there is no surer demonstration in any matter , because it is grounded upon this principle , That the will of God is the rule of righteousness . - Romans 9:20 An amplification of the former answer , taken from a comparison , whereby also it appeareth that God ’ s determined counsel is set of Paul the highest of all causes , so that it dependeth not upon any respect of second causes , but doth rather frame and direct them . - Romans 9:20 This similitude agreeth very fitly in the first creation of mankind . - Romans 9:21 Alluding to the creation of Adam , he compareth mankind not yet made ( but in the Creator ’ s mind ) to a lump of clay : whereof afterward God made and doth daily make , according as he purposed from everlasting both such as should be elect , and such as should be reprobate , as also this word , making , declareth . - Romans 9:21 Whereas in the objection propounded , mention was only made of vessels to dishonor : yet he speaketh of the other also in this answer , for that he proveth the Creator to be just in either of them , as the rule of contraries doth require . - Romans 9:21 To honest uses . - Romans 9:21 Seeing then , that in the name of dishonor , the ignomy of everlasting death is signified , they speak with Paul , which say , that some are made of God to most just destruction : and they [ that ] are offended with this kind of speech bewray their own folly . - Romans 9:22 The second answer is this , that God , moreover and besides that he doth justly decree whatsoever he doth decree , useth that moderation in executing of his decrees , as declareth his singular lenity even in the reprobate in that , that he suffereth them a long time , and permitteth them to enjoy many and singular benefits , until at length he justly condemns them : and that to good end and purpose , to wit , to show himself to be an enemy and revenger of wickedness , that it may appear what power he is of by these severe judgments , and finally by comparison of contraries to set forth indeed , how great his mercy is towards the elect . - Romans 9:22 By vessels , the Hebrews understand all kinds of instruments . - Romans 9:22 Therefore again , we may say with Paul that some men are made of God the Creator to destruction . - Romans 9:23 The unmeasurable and marvelous greatness . - Romans 9:24 Having established the doctrine of the eternal predestination of God on both parts : that is , as well of the reprobate , as of the elect , he cometh now to show the use of it , teaching us that we ought not to seek the testimony of it in the secret counsel of God , but by the vocation which is made manifest and set forth in the Church , propounding unto us the example of the Jews and Gentiles , that the doctrine may be better perceived . - Romans 9:24 He saith not that all and every one of the Jews are called , but some of the Jews , and some of the Gentiles . - Romans 9:25 Our vocation or calling is free and of grace , even as our predestination is : and therefore there is no cause why either our own unworthiness , or the unworthiness of our ancestors should cause us to think that we are not the elect and chosen of God , if we be called of him , and so embrace through faith the salvation that is offered us . - Romans 9:27 Contrariwise , Neither any outward general calling , neither any worthiness of our ancestors is a sufficient witness of election , unless by faith and belief we answer God ’ s calling : which thing came to pass in the Jews , as the Lord had forewarned . - Romans 9:28 God purposeth to bring the unkind and unthankful people to an extreme fewness . - Romans 9:29 Armies , by which word the chiefest power that is , is given to God . - Romans 9:29 Even a very few . - Romans 9:30 The declaration and manifestation of our election , is our calling apprehended by faith , as it came to pass in the Gentiles . - Romans 9:30 So then , the Gentiles had no works to prepare and procure God ’ s mercy beforehand : and as for that , that the Gentiles attained to that which they sought not for , the mercy of God is to be thanked for it : and in that the Jews attained not that which they sought after , they can thank none for it but themselves , because they sought it not aright . - Romans 9:31 The pride of men is the cause that they condemn vocation , so that the cause of their damnation need not to be sought for any other where but in themselves . - Romans 9:32 Seeking to come by righteousness , they followed the Law of righteousness .

GNV	Romans	10	1	Brethren , [ a ] mine hearts desire and prayer to God for Israel is , that they might be saved .
GNV	Romans	10	3	[ b ] For they , [ c ] being ignorant of the righteousness of God , and going about to [ d ] establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God .
GNV	Romans	10	4	( A ) [ e ] For Christ is the [ f ] end of the Law for righteousness unto [ g ] everyone that believeth .
GNV	Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , ( G ) How beautiful are the feet of them which bring glad tidings of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
GNV	Romans	10	20	( K ) And Isaiah is [ aa ] bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not , and have been made manifest to them that asked not after me .
GNV	Romans	10	2	For I bear them record that they have the zeal of God , but not according to knowledge .
GNV	Romans	10	5	[ h ] For Moses thus describeth the righteousness which is of the Law , ( B ) That the man which doeth these things , shall live thereby .
GNV	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith , speaketh on this wise , ( C ) [ i ] Say not in thine heart , Who shall ascend into heaven ? ( that is to bring Christ from above . )
GNV	Romans	10	7	Or , Who shall descend into the deep ? ( that is to bring Christ again from the dead . )
GNV	Romans	10	8	[ j ] But what saith it ? ( D ) The [ k ] word is near thee , even in thy mouth , and in thine heart . This is the word of faith which we preach .
GNV	Romans	10	9	[ l ] For if thou shalt [ m ] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart , that [ n ] God raised him up from the dead , thou shalt be saved :
GNV	Romans	10	11	[ p ] For the Scripture saith , ( E ) Whosoever [ q ] believeth in him , shall not be ashamed .
GNV	Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Grecian : for he that is Lord over all , is rich unto all that call on him .
GNV	Romans	10	13	( F ) [ r ] For whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord , shall be saved .
GNV	Romans	10	14	But how shall they call on him , in whom they have not believed ? [ s ] and how shall they believe in him , of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
GNV	Romans	10	16	[ t ] But they have not [ u ] all obeyed the Gospel : for Isaiah saith , ( H ) Lord , who hath believed our report ?
GNV	Romans	10	17	[ v ] Then faith is by hearing , and hearing by the [ w ] word of God .
GNV	Romans	10	18	[ x ] But I demand , Have they not heard ? ( I ) No doubt their sound went out through all the earth , and their words into the ends of the world .
GNV	Romans	10	19	[ y ] But I demand , Did not Israel know God ? First Moses saith , ( J ) I will provoke you to envy by a [ z ] nation that is not my nation , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
GNV	Romans	10	21	And unto Israel he saith , All the day long have I stretched forth mine hand unto a disobedient , and gainsaying people . Footnotes - Romans 10:1 Purposing to set forth in the Jews an example of marvelous obstinacy , he useth an insinuation . - Romans 10:3 The first entrance into the vocation unto salvation , is to renounce our own righteousness : the next is , to embrace that righteousness by faith , which God freely offereth us the Gospel . - Romans 10:3 The ignorance of the Law which we ought to know , excuseth none before God , especially it excuseth not them that are of his household . - Romans 10:3 Ignorance hath always pride joined with it . - Romans 10:4 The proof : The Law itself hath respect unto Christ , that such as believe in him should be saved . Therefore the calling to salvation by the works of the law is vain and foolish , but Christ is offered for salvation to every believer . - Romans 10:4 The end of the Law is to justify them that keep the Law : but seeing we do not observe the Law through the fault of our flesh , we attain not unto this end : but Christ salveth this disease , for he fulfilled the Law for us . - Romans 10:4 Not only to the Jews , but also to the Gentiles . - Romans 10:5 That the Law regardeth and tendeth to Christ , that is a manifest proof , for that is propoundeth such a condition , as can be and is fulfilled of none but Christ only : which being imputed unto us by faith , our conscience is quieted , so that now no man can ask , Who can ascend up into heaven , or bring us from hell , seeing the Gospel teacheth that both of these is done by Christ , and that for their sakes , which with true faith embrace him which calleth them . - Romans 10:6 Think not with thyself , as men that are staggering use to do . - Romans 10:8 Vocation cometh by the word preached . - Romans 10:8 By the word , Moses understood the Law which the Lord published with his own voice : and Paul applied it to the preaching of the Gospel which was the perfection of the Law . - Romans 10:9 That is indeed true faith which is settled not only in the head , but also in the heart of man , whereof also we give testimony , by our outward life , and which tendeth to Christ as to our alone and only Savior , even as he setteth forth himself in his word . - Romans 10:9 If thou profess plainly , sincerely , and openly , that thou takest Jesus only to be thy Lord and Savior . - Romans 10:9 The Father , who is said to have raised the Son from the dead : and this is not spoken to shut out the divinity of the Son , but to set forth the Father ’ s counsel touching our redemption in the resurrection of the Son . - Romans 10:10 Faith is said to justify , and furthermore seeing the confession of the mouth is an effect of faith , and confession is the way to come to salvation , it followeth that faith is also said to save . - Romans 10:11 Now he proveth the other part which he propounded afore in the fourth verse , to wit , that Christ calleth whomsoever he listeth without any difference , and this he confirmeth by a double testimony . - Romans 10:11 To believe in God is to yield and consent to God ’ s promise of our salvation by Christ , and that not only in general , but when we know that the promises pertain to us whereupon riseth a sure trust . - Romans 10:13 True calling upon the Name of God is the testimony of true faith , and true faith of true vocation or calling , and true calling , of true election . - Romans 10:14 That is , true faith which seeketh God in his word , and that preached according as God hath appointed in the Church . - Romans 10:16 Wheresover faith is , there is also the word , but not contrariwise , wheresoever the word is , there is faith also : for many refuse and reject the word . - Romans 10:16 He speaketh this because of the Jews . - Romans 10:17 A conclusion of the former gradation : we must ascend from faith , to our vocation , as by our vocation we came to the testimony of our election . - Romans 10:17 By God ’ s Commandment . - Romans 10:18 An objection : If calling be a testimony of election , were not the Jews called ? why should I not … that , saith the Apostle , seeing that there is no nation which hath not been called ? much less can I say , that the Jews were not called . - Romans 10:19 The defender and maintainer of the Jews ’ cause goeth on still to ask , whether the Jews also knew not God which called them . Isaiah ( saith the Apostle ) denieth it : and witnesseth that the Gospel was translated from them to the Gentiles , because the Jews neglected it . And therewithall the Apostle teacheth , that that outward and universal calling , which is set forth by the creation of the world , sufficeth not to the knowledge of God : yea , and that the particular also which is by the word of God , is of itself of small or no efficacy , unless it be apprehended or laid hold on by faith , by the gift of God : otherwise by unbelief it is made unprofitable , and that by the only fault of man , who can pretend no ignorance . - Romans 10:19 He calleth all profane people , a nation that is no nation , that they are not said to live but to die , which are appointed for everlasting condemnation . - Romans 10:20 Speaketh without fear . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Romans	11	11	[ p ] I demand then , Have they stumbled , that they should fall ? God forbid : but through their fall , salvation cometh unto the Gentiles , to provoke them to follow them .

GNV	Romans	11	1	I Demand then , [ a ] Hath God cast away his people ? God forbid : for [ b ] I also am an Israelite , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
GNV	Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God to him ? ( B ) I have [ f ] reserved unto myself seven thousand men , which have not bowed the knee to [ g ] Baal .
GNV	Romans	11	16	[ v ] For if the [ w ] firstfruits be holy , so is the whole lump : and if the [ x ] root be holy , so are the branches .
GNV	Romans	11	23	[ ah ] And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be grafted in : for God is able to graft them in again .
GNV	Romans	11	18	[ ab ] Boast not thyself against the branches : and if thou boast thyself , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
GNV	Romans	11	24	For if thou wast cut out of the Olive tree , which was wild by [ ai ] nature , and was grafted contrary to nature in a [ aj ] right Olive tree , how much more shall they that are by nature , be grafted in their own Olive tree ?
GNV	Romans	11	33	[ at ] O the deepness of the riches , both of the wisdom , and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his [ au ] judgments , and his [ av ] ways past finding out !
GNV	Romans	11	2	[ c ] God hath not cast away his people which he [ d ] knew before . [ e ] Know ye not what the Scripture saith of Elijah , how he communeth with God against Israel , saying ,
GNV	Romans	11	3	( A ) Lord , they have killed thy Prophets , and dug down thine Altars : and I am left alone , and they seek my life ?
GNV	Romans	11	5	Even so then , at this present time is there a remnant according to the [ h ] election of grace .
GNV	Romans	11	6	[ i ] And if it be of grace , it is [ j ] no more of works : or else were grace no more grace : but if it be of works , it is no more grace : or else were work no more work .
GNV	Romans	11	7	What then ? Israel hath not obtained that he sought : but the election hath obtained it , and the rest have been [ k ] hardened ,
GNV	Romans	11	8	[ l ] According as it is written , ( C ) God hath given them the spirit of [ m ] slumber : eyes that they [ n ] should not see , and ears that they should not hear unto this day .
GNV	Romans	11	9	And David saith , ( D ) [ o ] Let their table be made a snare , and a net , and a stumbling block , even for a recompense unto them .
GNV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened that they see not , and bow down their back always .
GNV	Romans	11	12	Wherefore if the fall of them be the [ q ] riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles , how much more shall their [ r ] abundance be ?
GNV	Romans	11	13	[ s ] For in that I speak to you Gentiles , inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles , I [ t ] magnify mine office ,
GNV	Romans	11	14	To try if by any means I might provoke them of my flesh to follow them , and might save some of them .
GNV	Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving be , [ u ] but life from the dead ?
GNV	Romans	11	17	( E ) [ y ] And though some of the branches be broken off , and thou being a wild Olive tree , wast grafted in [ z ] for them , and made [ aa ] partaker of the root and fatness of the Olive tree :
GNV	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then , The branches are broken off , that I might be grafted in .
GNV	Romans	11	20	Well : through unbelief they are broken off , and thou standest by faith : be not high-minded , but [ ac ] fear .
GNV	Romans	11	21	For if God spared not the [ ad ] natural branches , take heed , lest he also spare not thee .
GNV	Romans	11	22	[ ae ] Behold therefore the [ af ] bountifulness , and severity of God : toward them which have fallen , severity : but toward thee , bountifulness , if thou continue in his [ ag ] bountifulness : or else thou shalt also be cut off .
GNV	Romans	11	25	[ ak ] For I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this secret ( lest ye should be arrogant in [ al ] yourselves ) that partly obstinacy is come to Israel , until the fullness of the Gentiles be [ am ] come in .
GNV	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved , as it is written , ( F ) The deliverer shall come out of Zion , and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob .
GNV	Romans	11	27	And this is my covenant to them , ( G ) When I shall take away their sins .
GNV	Romans	11	28	[ an ] As concerning the [ ao ] Gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the [ ap ] election , they are beloved for the fathers ’ sakes .
GNV	Romans	11	29	[ aq ] For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
GNV	Romans	11	30	[ ar ] For even as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
GNV	Romans	11	31	Even so now have they not believed by the mercy showed unto you , that they also may obtain mercy .
GNV	Romans	11	32	For God hath shut up [ as ] all in unbelief , that he might have mercy on all .
GNV	Romans	11	34	( H ) [ aw ] For who hath known the mind of the Lord ? or who was his counselor ?
GNV	Romans	11	35	Or who hath given unto him [ ax ] first , and he shall be recompensed ?
GNV	Romans	11	36	For of him , and through him , and for [ ay ] him are all things : to him be glory forever . Amen . Footnotes - Romans 11:1 Now the Apostle showeth how this doctrine is to be applied to others , abiding still in his propounded cause . Therefore he teacheth us that all the Jews in particular are not cast away , and therefore we ought not to pronounce rashly of private persons , whether they be of the number of the elect or not . - Romans 11:1 The first proof , I am a Jew , and yet elected , therefore we may and ought fully to resolve upon our election , as hath been before said : but of another man ’ s we can not be so certainly resolved , and yet ours may cause us to hope well of others . - Romans 11:2 The second proof : Because that God is faithful in his league or Covenant , although men be unfaithful : So then seeing that God hath said , that he will be the God of his unto a thousand generations , we must take heed , that we think not that the whole race and offspring is cast off , by reason of the unbelief of a few , but rather , that we hope well of every member of the Church , because of God ’ s league and Covenant . - Romans 11:2 Which he loved and chose from everlasting . - Romans 11:2 The third proof , taken from the answer that was made to Elijah : even then also , when there appeared openly to the face of the world no elect , yet God knew his elect and chosen , and of them also good store and number . Whereupon this also is concluded , that we ought not rashly to pronounce of any man as of a reprobate , seeing that the Church is oftentimes brought to that state , that even the most watchful and sharp-sighted pastors think it to be clean extinct and put out . - Romans 11:4 He speaketh of remnants and reserved people which were chosen from everlasting , and not of remnants that should be chosen afterward : for they are not chosen , because they were not idolaters , but therefore they were not idolaters , because they were chosen and elect . - Romans 11:4 Baal signifieth as much as Master or patron , or one in whose power another is , which name the idolaters at this day give their idols , naming them patrons , and patronesses or Ladies . - Romans 11:5 The election of grace , is not whereby men chose grace , but whereby God chose us of his grace and goodness . - Romans 11:6 Although that all be not elect and chosen , yet let them that are elected , remember that they are freely chosen , and let them that stubbornly refuse the grace and free mercy of God , impute it unto themselves . - Romans 11:6 This saying beateth down flat to the ground all the doctrine of all kinds and manner of works , whereby our justifiers of themselves do teach , that works are either wholly or partly the cause of our justification . - Romans 11:7 See Mark 3:5 . - Romans 11:8 And yet this hardness of heart cometh not but by God ’ s just decree and judgment , and yet without fault , whom as he so punisheth the unthankful by taking from them all sense and perseverance and by doubling their darkness , that the benefits of God which are offered unto them , do redound to their just destruction . - Romans 11:8 A very dead sleep which taketh away all sense . - Romans 11:8 That is , eyes unjust to see . - Romans 11:9 As unhappy birds are enticed to death by that which is their sustenance , so did that only thing turn to the Jews ’ destruction , out of which they sought life , to wit , the Law of God , for the preposterous zeal whereof they refused the Gospel . - Romans 11:11 God appointed this casting out of the Jews , that it might be an occasion to call the Gentiles : and again might turn this calling of the Gentiles , to be an occasion to restore the Jews , to wit , that they being inflamed and provoked by emulation of the Gentiles , might themselves at length embrace the Gospel . And hereby we may learn , that the severity of God serveth as well for the setting forth of his glory as his mercy doth , and also that God prepares himself a way to mercy , by his severity , so that we ought not rashly to despair of any man , nor proudly triumph over other men , but rather provoke them to an holy emulation , that God may be glorified in them also . - Romans 11:12 By riches he meaneth the knowledge of the Gospel to everlasting life : and by the world , all nations dispersed throughout the whole world . - Romans 11:12 Of the Jews , when the whole nation without exception shall come to Christ . - Romans 11:13 He witnesseth by his own example , that he goeth before all others in this behalf . - Romans 11:13 I make noble and famous . - Romans 11:15 It shall come to pass that when the Jews come to the Gospel , the world shall as it were come quicken again , and rise up from death to life . - Romans 11:16 The nation of the Jews being considered in their stock and root , that is , in Abraham , is holy , although that many of the branches be cut off . Therefore in judging of our brethren , we must not stick in their unworthiness , to think that they are at once all cast off , but we ought to consider the root of the Covenant , and rather go back to their ancestors which were faithful , that we may know that the blessing of the Covenant resteth in some of their posterity , as we also find proof hereof in ourselves . - Romans 11:16 He alludeth to the firstfruits of the loaves by the offering whereof all the whole crop of corn was sanctified , and they might vie the rest of the year following with good conscience . - Romans 11:16 Abraham . - Romans 11:17 There is no cause why the Gentiles which have obtained mercy , should triumph over the Jews which condemn the grace of God , seeing they are grafted into the Jews ’ ancestors . But let them rather take heed that that also be not found in them which is worthily condemned in the Jews . And hereof also this general doctrine may be gathered and taken , that we ought to be studious of God ’ s glory , even in respect of our neighbors : so far ought we to be from bragging and glorying , for that , that we are preferred before others by a singular grace . - Romans 11:17 In place of those boughs which are broken off . - Romans 11:17 It is against the common course of husbandry , that the barren juice of the imp is changed with the juice of the good tree . - Romans 11:18 We may rejoice in the Lord , but so that we despise not the Jews , whom we ought rather to provoke to that good striving with us . - Romans 11:20 See that thou stand in awe of God modestly and carefully . - Romans 11:21 He calleth them natural , not because they had any holiness of nature , but because they were born of them , whom the Lord set apart for himself from , other nations , by his league and covenant which he freely made with them . - Romans 11:22 Seeing the matter itself declareth that election cometh not by inheritance ( although the fault be in men , and not in God , why the blessing of God is not perpetual ) we must take good heed , that that be not found in ourselves , which we think blameworthy in others , for the election is sure , but they that are truly elect and ingrafted , are not proud in themselves with contempt of others , but with due reverence to God , and love towards their neighbor , run to the mark which is set before them . - Romans 11:22 The tender and loving heart . - Romans 11:22 In that state which God ’ s bountifulness hath advanced thee unto : and we must mark here , that he speaketh not of the election of every private man , which remaineth steadfast forever , but of the election of the whole nation . - Romans 11:23 Many are now for a season cut off , that is , are without the root , which in their time shall be grafted in : and again there are a great sort , which after a sort , and touching the outward show , seem to be ingrafted , which notwithstanding through their own fault afterward are cut off and clean cast away : which thing is especially to be considered in nations and peoples , as in the Gentiles and Jews . - Romans 11:24 Understand nature , not as it was first made , but as it was corrupted in Adam , and so derived from him to his posterity . - Romans 11:24 Into the people of the Jews which God had sanctified of his mere grace : and he speaketh of the whole nation , not of every one part . - Romans 11:25 The blindness of the Jews is neither so universal that the Lord hath no elect in that nation , neither shall it be continual : for there shall be a time wherein they also ( as the Prophets have forewarned ) shall effectually embrace that which they do now so stubbornly for the most part reject and refuse . - Romans 11:25 That ye be not proud within yourselves . - Romans 11:25 Into the Church . - Romans 11:28 Again , that he may join the Jews and Gentiles together as it were in one body , and especially may teach what duty the Gentiles owe to the Jews , he beateth this into their heads , that the nation of the Jews is not utterly cast off without hope of recovery . - Romans 11:28 Forasmuch as they received it not . - Romans 11:28 In that , that God respecteth not what they deserve , but what he promised to Abraham . - Romans 11:29 The reason or proof : because the covenant made with that nation of life everlasting , can not be frustrate and vain . - Romans 11:30 Another reason , because that although that they which are hardened , are worthily punished , yet hath not this stubbornness of the Jews so come to pass properly for an hatred to that nation , but that an entry might as it were be opened to bring in the Gentiles , and afterward the Jews being inflamed with emulation of this mercy which is showed to the Gentiles , might themselves also be partakers of the same benefit , and so it might appear that both Jews and Gentiles are saved , only by the free mercy and grace of God , which could not have been so manifest , if at the beginning , God had brought all together into the Church , or if he had saved the nation of the Jews without this interruption . - Romans 11:32 Both Jews and Gentiles . - Romans 11:33 The Apostle crieth not as astonished with this wonderful wisdom of God , which he teacheth us , ought to be religiously reverenced , and not curiously and profanely to be searched beyond the compass of that that God hath revealed unto us . - Romans 11:33 The course that he holdeth in governing all things both generally and particularly . - Romans 11:33 The order of his counsels and doings . - Romans 11:34 He bridleth three manner of ways , the wicked boldness of man : First , because that God is above all , most wise , and therefore it is very absurd , and plainly godless to measure him by our folly . Moreover , because he is debtor to no man , and therefore no man can complain of injury done unto him . Thirdly , because all things are made for his glory , and therefore we must refer all things to his glory , much less may we contend and debate the matter with him . - Romans 11:35 This saying overthroweth the doctrine of foreseen works and merits . - Romans 11:36 To wit , for God , to whose glory all things are referred , not only things that were made , but especially his new works which he worketh in his elect .

GNV	Romans	12	3	[ i ] For I [ j ] say through the grace that is given unto me , to everyone that is among you , that no man [ k ] presume to understand above that which is meet to understand , but that he understand according to [ l ] sobriety , as God hath dealt to every man the ( B ) measure of [ m ] faith .
GNV	Romans	12	4	[ n ] For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not one office ,
GNV	Romans	12	5	So we being many , are one body in Christ , and every one , one anothers members .
GNV	Romans	12	6	( C ) [ o ] Seeing then that we have gifts that are divers , according to the grace that is given unto us , whether we have prophecy , let us prophesy according to the [ p ] portion of faith .
GNV	Romans	12	7	Or an office , let us wait on the office : or he that [ q ] teacheth , on teaching :
GNV	Romans	12	8	Or he that [ r ] exhorteth , on exhortation : he that [ s ] distributeth , let him do it ( D ) with simplicity : he that [ t ] ruleth , with diligence : he that [ u ] showeth mercy , with cheerfulness .
GNV	Romans	12	10	( F ) Be affectioned to love one another with brotherly love . In giving honor , go one before another .
GNV	Romans	12	11	Not slothful to do service , fervent in spirit [ w ] serving the Lord ,
GNV	Romans	12	13	( H ) [ y ] Distributing unto the [ z ] necessities of the Saints : ( I ) giving yourselves to hospitality .
GNV	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with them that rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
GNV	Romans	12	16	Be like affectioned one towards another : ( K ) be not high-minded : but make yourselves equal to them of the [ aa ] lower sort : be not [ ab ] wise in yourselves .
GNV	Romans	12	17	( L ) Recompense to no man evil for evil : procure things honest in the sight of all men .
GNV	Romans	12	18	( M ) If it be possible , as much as in you is , have peace with all men .
GNV	Romans	12	19	Dearly beloved , ( N ) avenge not yourselves , but give place unto wrath : for it is written , ( O ) Vengeance is mine : I will repay , saith the Lord .
GNV	Romans	12	21	Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with goodness . Footnotes - Romans 12:1 The fourth part of this Epistle , which after the finishing of the chief points of Christian doctrine , consisteth in declaring of precepts of Christian life . And first of all he giveth general precepts and grounds : the chiefest whereof is this that every man consecrate himself wholly to the spiritual service of God , and do as it were sacrifice himself , trusting to the grace of God . - Romans 12:1 By this preface he showeth that God ’ s glory is the utmost end of all our doings . - Romans 12:1 In times past the sacrifices were presented before the altar , but now the altar is everywhere . - Romans 12:1 Yourselves : in times past , other bodies than our own , now our own must be offered . - Romans 12:1 In times past , dead sacrifices were offered , but now we must offer such as have the spirit of life in them . - Romans 12:1 Spiritual . - Romans 12:2 The second precept is this , That we take not other men ’ s opinions or manners for a rule of life , but that we wholly renouncing this world , set before us as our mark , the will of God , as it is manifested and opened unto us in his word . - Romans 12:2 Why then there is no place left for reason , which the heathen Philosophers place as a Queen in a Castle , nor for man ’ s free will , which the Popish Schoolmen dream on , if the mind must be renewed . See Eph . 1:18 and 2:5 and 4:17 and Col. 1:21 . - Romans 12:3 Thirdly he admonisheth us very earnestly , that every man keep himself within the bounds of his vocation , and that every man be wise according to the measure of grace that God hath given him . - Romans 12:3 I charge . - Romans 12:3 That he please not himself too much , as they do , which persuade themselves they know more than indeed they do . - Romans 12:3 We will be sober if we take not that upon us , which we have not , and if we brag not of that we have . - Romans 12:3 By faith he meaneth the knowledge of God in Christ , and the gifts which the holy Ghost poureth upon the faithful . - Romans 12:4 There is a double reason of the precept going afore : the one is because God hath not committed everything to be done of every man : and therefore , he doeth backwardly , and not only unprofitably , but also to the great disprofit of others , wearieth himself and others , which passeth the bounds of his vocation : the other is , for that this diversity and inequality of vocations and gifts , redoundeth to our commodity seeing that the same is therefore instituted and appointed , that we should be bound one to another . Whereupon it followeth that no man ought to be grieved thereat , seeing that the use of every private gift is common . - Romans 12:6 That which he spake before in general , he applieth particularly to the holy functions , wherein men offend with greater danger . And he divideth them into two sorts , to wit , into Prophets , and Deacons , and again he divideth the Prophets into doctors , and Pastors . And of Deacons he maketh three sorts : to wit , the one to be such as are ( as it were ) treasurers of the Church coffers , whom he calleth properly Deacons : the other to be the governors of discipline , who are called Seniors or Elders : the third to be such as properly served in the help of the poor , of which sort the company of widows were . - Romans 12:6 That every man observe the measure of that which is revealed unto him . - Romans 12:7 Whose office only is to expound the Scriptures . - Romans 12:8 Who in other places is called the Pastor . - Romans 12:8 To wit , the alms , that he distribute them faithfully , and without respect of person . - Romans 12:8 The Elders of the Church . - Romans 12:8 They that are busied about tending on the poor , must do it with cheerfulness , lest they add sorrow to sorrow . - Romans 12:9 Now he cometh to the duties of the second Table , which he deriveth from charity , which is as it were the fountain of them all . And he defineth Christian charity by sincerity , hatred of evil , earnest study of good things , good affection to help our neighbor , and whose final end is , the glory of God . - Romans 12:11 This piece is well put in , for it maketh difference between Christian duties , and Philosophical duties . - Romans 12:12 He reckoneth up divers other virtues together with their effects , to wit , hope , patience in tribulation , equanimity , continuance in prayer , liberality towards the saints , hospitality , moderation of mind , even in helping our enemies , a selfsame feeling with others as well in adversity as prosperity , modesty , endeavor to maintain honest concord so nigh as we may with all men , which can not be extinguished by any man ’ s injuries . - Romans 12:13 A true rule of charity , when we are no less touched with other men ’ s wants , than with our own , and having that feeling , help them as much as we can . - Romans 12:13 Not upon pleasure , and needless duties , but upon necessary uses . - Romans 12:16 There is nothing that doth so much break concord as ambition , when as every man loatheth a base estate , and seeketh ambitiously to be aloft . - Romans 12:16 Be not puffed up , with opinion of your own wisdom . - Romans 12:20 After this sort doth Solomon point out the wrath of God which hangeth over a man .

GNV	Romans	13	1	Let ( A ) [ a ] every [ b ] soul be subject unto the higher [ c ] powers : [ d ] for there is no power but of God : and the powers that be , are [ e ] ordained of God .
GNV	Romans	13	8	[ o ] Owe nothing to any man , but to love one another : [ p ] for he that loveth another , hath fulfilled the [ q ] Law .
GNV	Romans	13	14	( G ) But [ v ] put ye on the Lord JESUS CHRIST , and take no thought for the flesh , to fulfill the lust of it . Footnotes - Romans 13:1 Now he showeth severally , what subjects owe to their Magistrates , to wit , obedience : From which he showeth that no man is free : and in such sort that it is not only due to the highest Magistrate himself , but also even to the basest , which hath any office under him . - Romans 13:1 Yea , though an Apostle , though an Evangelist , though a Prophet : Chrysostom . Therefore the tyranny of the Pope over all kingdoms must down to the ground . - Romans 13:1 A reason taken of the nature of the thing itself : For to what purpose are they placed in higher degree , but that the inferior should be subject unto them ? - Romans 13:1 Another argument of great force : Because God is author of this order : so that such as are rebels ought to know , that they make war with God himself : wherefore they can not but purchase to themselves great misery and calamity . - Romans 13:1 Be distributed : for some are greater , some smaller . - Romans 13:3 The third argument taken from the end wherefore they were made , which is most profitable : for that God by this means preserveth the good and bridleth the wicked : by which words the Magistrates themselves are put in mind of that duty which they owe to their subjects . - Romans 13:3 An excellent way to bear this yoke , not only without grief , but also with great profit . - Romans 13:4 God hath armed the Magistrate even with a revenging sword . - Romans 13:4 By whom God revengeth the wicked . - Romans 13:5 The conclusion : We must obey the magistrate , not only for fear of punishment , but much more because that ( although the Magistrate have no power over the conscience of man , yet seeing he is God ’ s minister ) he can not be resisteth by any good conscience . - Romans 13:5 So far as lawfully we may : for if unlawful things be commanded us , we must answer as Peter teacheth us , It is better to obey God than men . - Romans 13:6 He reckoneth up the chiefest things wherein consisteth the obedience of subjects . - Romans 13:7 Obedience , and that from the heart . - Romans 13:7 Reverence , ( which as reason is ) we must give to the Magistrate . - Romans 13:8 He showeth how very few judgments need to be executed , to wit , if we so order our life , as no man may justly require anything of us , besides that only that we owe one to another , by the perpetual law of charity . - Romans 13:8 He commendeth charity , as an abridgement of the whole Law . - Romans 13:8 He hath not only done one commandment , but performed generally that which the Law commandeth . - Romans 13:9 For the whole Law commandeth nothing else , but that we love God and our neighbor . But seeing Paul speaketh here of the duties we owe one to another , we must restrain this word , Law to the second Table . - Romans 13:11 An application taken of the circumstance of the time : which also itself putteth us in mind of our duty , seeing that this remaineth after that the darkness of ignorance and wicked affections by the knowledge of God ’ s truth be driven out of us , that we order our life according to that certain and sure rule of all righteousness and honesty , being fully grounded upon the virtue of the Spirit of Christ . - Romans 13:12 In other places we are said to be in the light , but yet so , that it appeareth not as yet what we are , for as yet we see but as it were in the twilight . - Romans 13:12 That kind of life , which they lead , that flee the light . - Romans 13:14 To put on Christ , is to possess Christ , to have him in us , and us in him .

GNV	Romans	13	2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist , shall receive to themselves condemnation .
GNV	Romans	13	3	[ f ] For Magistrates are not to be feared for good works , but for evil . [ g ] Wilt thou then be without fear of the power ? do well : so shalt thou have praise of the same .
GNV	Romans	13	4	For he is the minister of God for thy wealth : [ h ] but if thou do evil , fear : for he beareth not the sword for nought : for he is the minister of God to [ i ] take vengeance on him that doeth evil .
GNV	Romans	13	5	[ j ] Wherefore ye must be subject , not because of wrath only , but [ k ] also for conscience sake .
GNV	Romans	13	6	[ l ] For , for this cause ye pay also tribute : for they are God ’ s ministers , applying themselves for the same thing .
GNV	Romans	13	7	( B ) Give to all men therefore their duty : tribute , to whom ye owe tribute : custom , to whom custom : fear , to whom [ m ] fear : honor , to whom ye owe [ n ] honor .
GNV	Romans	13	9	For this , ( C ) Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , Thou shalt not covet : and if there be any other commandment , it is [ r ] briefly comprehended in this saying , even in this , ( D ) Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
GNV	Romans	13	10	Love doeth not evil to his neighbor : therefore is love the ( E ) fulfilling of the Law .

GNV	Romans	14	1	Him [ a ] that is weak in the faith , [ b ] receive unto you , but not for [ c ] controversies of disputations .
GNV	Romans	14	2	[ d ] One [ e ] believeth that he may eat of all things : and another , which is weak , eateth herbs .
GNV	Romans	14	5	[ i ] This man esteemeth one day above another day , and another man counteth every day alike : [ j ] let [ k ] every man be fully persuaded in his mind .
GNV	Romans	14	10	, Let not the strong condemn the weak for these things , seeing that the weak brethren are brethren notwithstanding . Now if any man would draw this doctrine to these our times and ages , let them know that the Apostle speaketh of such things indifferent , as they which thought them not to be indifferent , had a ground in the Law , and were deceived by simple ignorance : and not of malice ( for to such the Apostles yielded not , no not for a moment ) nor superstition , but of a religious fear of God . - Romans 14:6 Observeth precisely . - Romans 14:6 God shall judge whether he do well or no : And therefore you should rather strive about this , how every one of you will be allowed of God , than to think upon other men ’ s doings . - Romans 14:6 He that maketh no difference of meats . - Romans 14:6 So the Apostle showeth that he speaketh of the faithful , both strong and weak . But what if we have to do with infidels ? Then must we here take heed of two things , as also is declared in the Epistle to the Corinthians . The one is , that we count not their superstitions among things indifferent , as they did which sat down to meat in Idols ’ Temples : the other is , that then also when the matter is indifferent ( as to buy a thing offered to idols , in the butcher ’ s shambles , and to eat it at home in a private banquet ) we wound not the conscience of our weak brother . - Romans 14:6 He that toucheth not meats which he taketh to be unclean by the Law . - Romans 14:7 We must not stick , saith he , in the meat itself , but in the use of the meat , so that he is justly to be reprehended that liveth so , that he casteth not his eyes upon God . For both our life and our death is dedicated to him , and for this cause Christ hath properly died , and not simply , that we might eat this meat or that . - Romans 14:7 Hath respect to himself only , which the Hebrews utter after this sort , Doeth well to his own soul . - Romans 14:10 The conclusion : we must leave to God his right : and therefore in matters , which according as the conscience if affected , are either good or evil , the strong must not despise their weak brethren , much less condemn them . But this consequent can not be taken of equal force in the contrary , to wit , that the weak should not judge the strong , because the weak do not know , that they which do not observe a day , and eat , observe it not to the Lord , and eat to the Lord , as the strong men know , that the weak which observe a day and eat not , observe the day to the Lord , and eat not to the Lord . - Romans 14:11 This is a form of an oath , proper to God only , for he and none but he liveth , and hath his being of himself . - Romans 14:11 Shall acknowledge me from God . - Romans 14:13 After that he hath concluded what is not to be done , he showeth what is to be done : to wit , we must take heed that we do not utterly cast down with abusing our liberty , our brother who is not yet strong . - Romans 14:13 He rebuketh by this way , these malicious judgers of others , which occupy their heads about nothing , but to find fault with their brethren ’ s life , whereas they should rather bestow their wits upon this , that they do not with their disdainfulness either cast their brethren clean down , or give them some offense . - Romans 14:14 The preventing of an objection : It is true that the schoolmastership of the Law is taken away by the benefit of Christ , to such as know it , but yet notwithstanding we have to consider in the use of this liberty what is expedient , that we may have regard of our weak brother , seeing that our liberty is not lost thereby . - Romans 14:14 By the Spirit of the Lord Jesus , or by the Lord Jesus , who I am sure brake down the wall at his coming . - Romans 14:14 By nature . - Romans 14:15 It is the part of a cruel mind to make more account of meat , than of our brother ’ s salvation . Which thing they do , that presume to eat with offense of any brother , and so give him occasion to go back from the Gospel . - Romans 14:15 Another argument : We must follow Christ ’ s example : who was so far from destroying the weak with meat , that he gave his life for them . - Romans 14:16 Another argument : for that by this means the liberty of the Gospel is evil spoken of , as though it openeth the way to attempt any thing whatsoever , and boldeneth us to all things . - Romans 14:17 A general reason , and the ground of all the other arguments : The kingdom of heaven consisteth not in these outward things , but in the study of righteousness , and peace , and comfort of the holy Ghost . - Romans 14:18 He that liveth peaceably , and doeth righteously , through the holy Ghost . - Romans 14:19 A general conclusion : The use of this liberty , yea and our whole life , ought to be referred to the edifying of one another , insomuch that we esteem that thing unlawful by reason of the offense of our brother , which is of itself pure and lawful . - Romans 14:22 He giveth a double warning in these matters , one , which pertaineth to the strong , that he which hath obtained a sure knowledge of this liberty , keep that treasure to the end he may use it wisely and profitably as hath been said : the other which respecteth the weak , that they do nothing rashly by other men ’ s example with a wavering conscience , for that can not be done without sin , whereof we are not persuaded by the word of God , that he liketh , and approveth it . - Romans 14:22 He showed before verse
GNV	Romans	14	19	[ ag ] Let us then follow those things which concern peace , and wherewith one may edify another .
GNV	Romans	14	20	Destroy not the work of God for meat ’ s sake : ( E ) all things indeed are pure : but it is evil for the man which eateth with offense .
GNV	Romans	14	22	[ ah ] Hast thou [ ai ] faith ? have it with thyself before God : blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he [ aj ] alloweth .
GNV	Romans	14	3	[ f ] Let not him that eateth , despise him that eateth not : and let not him which eateth not , condemn him that eateth : for [ g ] God hath received him .
GNV	Romans	14	4	( A ) [ h ] Who art thou that condemnest another man ’ s servant ? he standeth or falleth to his own master : yea , he shall be established : for God is able to make him stand .
GNV	Romans	14	6	[ l ] He that [ m ] observeth the day , observeth it to the Lord : and he that observeth not the day , observeth it not to the [ n ] Lord . He that [ o ] eateth , eateth to the Lord : [ p ] for he giveth God thanks : and he that eateth [ q ] not , eateth not to the Lord , and giveth God thanks .
GNV	Romans	14	7	[ r ] For none of us liveth to [ s ] himself , neither doth any die to himself .
GNV	Romans	14	8	For whether we live , we live unto the Lord : or whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lords .
GNV	Romans	14	9	For Christ therefore died and rose again , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and the quick .
GNV	Romans	14	11	For it is written , [ u ] I ( C ) live , saith the Lord , and every knee shall bow to me , and all tongues shall [ v ] confess unto God .
GNV	Romans	14	12	So then everyone of us shall give accounts of himself to God .
GNV	Romans	14	13	[ w ] Let us not therefore judge one another anymore : but use your judgment rather in [ x ] this that no man put an occasion to fall , or a stumbling block before his brother .
GNV	Romans	14	15	But if thy brother be grieved for the meat , now walkest thou not charitably : ( D ) [ ab ] destroy not him with thy meat , for whom [ ac ] Christ died .
GNV	Romans	14	16	[ ad ] Cause not your commodity to be evil spoken of .
GNV	Romans	14	17	[ ae ] For the kingdom of God , is not meat nor drink , but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the holy Ghost .
GNV	Romans	14	18	For whosoever in [ af ] these things serveth Christ , is acceptable unto God , and is approved of men .
GNV	Romans	14	21	( F ) It is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or made weak .
GNV	Romans	14	23	For he that [ ak ] doubteth , is condemned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : and whatsoever is not of faith , is sin . Footnotes - Romans 14:1 Now he showeth how we ought to behave ourselves toward our brethren in matters and things indifferent , offending in the use of them , not of malices or damnable superstition , but for lack of knowledge of the benefit of Christ . And thus he teacheth that they are to be instructed gently and patiently , and so that we apply ourselves to their ignorance in such matters according to the rule of charity . - Romans 14:1 Do not for a matter or thing that is indifferent , and such as you may do or not do , shun his company , but take him to you . - Romans 14:1 To make him by your doubtful and uncertain disputations go away more in doubt than he came , or start back with a troubled conscience . - Romans 14:2 He propoundeth for an example , the difference of meats , which some thought was necessarily to be observed as a thing prescribed by the Law ( not knowing that it was taken away ) whereas on the contrary side , such as had profited in the knowledge of the Gospel , knew well that this schoolmastership of the Law was abolished . - Romans 14:2 Knows by faith . - Romans 14:3 In such a matter , saith the Apostle , Let neither them which know their liberty , proudly despise their weaker brother , neither let the unlearned crabbedly or frowardly condemn that , that they understand not . - Romans 14:3 The first reason : Because that seeing both he that eateth and he that eateth not , is notwithstanding the member of Christ , neither he which eateth not , can justly be condemned , neither he which eateth be justly condemned : Now the first proposition is declared in the sixth verse following . - Romans 14:4 Another reason which hangeth upon the former : why the ruder and more unlearned ought not to be contemned of the more skillful , as men without hope of salvation : Because , saith the Apostle , he that is ignorant today , may be endued tomorrow with further knowledge , so that he also may stand sure : Therefore it belongeth to God , and not unto man , to pronounce the sentence of condemnation . - Romans 14:5 Another example of the difference of days according to the law . - Romans 14:5 He setteth against this contempt , and hasty or rash judgments , a continual desire to profit , that the strong may be certainly persuaded of their liberty , of what manner and sort it is , and how they ought to use it : and again the weak may daily profit , lest either they abuse the gift of God , or these please themselves in their infirmity . - Romans 14:5 That he may say in his conscience , that he knoweth and is persuaded by Jesus Christ , that nothing is unclean of itself , and this persuasion must be grounded upon the word of God . - Romans 14:6 A reason taken from the nature of indifferent things , which a man may with good conscience do and omit : for seeing that the difference of days and meats was appointed by God , how could they , which as yet understood not the abrogating of the Law , and yet otherwise acknowledged Christ as their Savior , with good conscience neglect that which they knew was commanded of God ? And on the contrary side , they that knew the benefit of Christ in this behalf , did with good conscience neither observe days nor meats . Therefore saith the Apostle , verse
GNV	Romans	15	15	Nevertheless , brethren , I have somewhat boldly after a sort written unto you , as one that putteth you in remembrance , through the grace that is given me of God ,

GNV	Romans	15	1	We [ a ] which are strong , ought to bear the infirmities of the weak , and not to [ b ] please ourselves .
GNV	Romans	15	5	[ h ] Now the God of patience and consolation give you that ye be ( B ) like-minded one towards another , according to Christ Jesus ,
GNV	Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another , as Christ also [ i ] received us to the glory of God .
GNV	Romans	15	8	[ j ] Now I say , that Jesus Christ was a minister of the [ k ] circumcision , for the [ l ] truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers .
GNV	Romans	15	10	And again he saith , ( D ) Rejoice , ye Gentiles with his people .
GNV	Romans	15	2	Therefore let every man please his neighbor in that that is [ c ] good to edification .
GNV	Romans	15	3	[ d ] For Christ also would not please himself , but as it is written , ( A ) The rebukes of them which rebuke thee , fell on me .
GNV	Romans	15	4	[ e ] For whatsoever things are written [ f ] aforetime , are written for our learning , that we through patience , and comfort of the [ g ] Scriptures might have hope .
GNV	Romans	15	6	That ye with one mind , and with one mouth may praise God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	Romans	15	9	[ m ] And let the Gentiles praise God , for his mercy , as it is written , ( C ) For this cause I will [ n ] confess thee among the Gentiles , and sing unto thy Name .
GNV	Romans	15	11	And again , ( E ) Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles , and laud ye him all people together .
GNV	Romans	15	12	And again Isaiah saith , ( F ) There shall be a root of Jesse , and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles , in him shall the Gentiles trust .
GNV	Romans	15	13	[ o ] Now the God of [ p ] hope fill you with [ q ] all joy , and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the holy Ghost .
GNV	Romans	15	14	[ r ] And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that [ s ] ye also are full of goodness , and filled with all knowledge , and are able to admonish one another .
GNV	Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ toward the Gentiles , ministering the Gospel of God , that the [ t ] offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the holy Ghost .
GNV	Romans	15	17	[ u ] I have therefore whereof I may rejoice in Christ Jesus in those things which pertain to God .
GNV	Romans	15	18	For I dare not speak of anything , which [ v ] Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient in word and deed ,
GNV	Romans	15	19	With the [ w ] power of signs and wonders , by the power of the spirit of God : so that from Jerusalem , and round about unto Illyricum , I have caused to abound the Gospel of Christ .
GNV	Romans	15	20	Yea , so I enforced myself to preach the Gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should have built on another man ’ s foundation .
GNV	Romans	15	21	But as it is written , ( G ) To whom he was not spoken of , they shall see him , and they that heard not , shall understand him .
GNV	Romans	15	22	( H ) [ x ] Therefore also I have been oft let to come unto you :
GNV	Romans	15	23	But now seeing I have no more place in these quarters , and also have ( I ) been desirous many years agone to come unto you ,
GNV	Romans	15	24	When I shall take my journey into Spain , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , after that I have been somewhat filled with your company .
GNV	Romans	15	25	But now go I to Jerusalem , to [ y ] minister unto the Saints .
GNV	Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia , to make a certain distribution unto the poor Saints which are at Jerusalem .
GNV	Romans	15	27	[ z ] For it hath pleased them , and their debtors are they : ( J ) for if the Gentiles be made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to [ aa ] minister unto them in carnal things .

GNV	Romans	15	29	[ ad ] And I know when I come , that I shall come to you with abundance of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ .
GNV	Romans	15	30	Also brethren , I beseech you for our Lord Jesus Christ ’ s sake , and for the [ ae ] love of the spirit , that ye would strive with me by prayers to God for me ,

Therefore much less ought the Gentiles despise them for certain faults , whom the Son of God so much esteemed . - Romans 15:8 Of the circumcised Jews , for as long as he lived , he never went out of their quarters . - Romans 15:8 That God might be seen to be true . - Romans 15:9 An applying of the same to the Gentiles , whom also the Lord of his incomprehensible goodness had regard of , so that they are not to be condemned of the Jews as strangers . - Romans 15:9 I will openly profess , and set forth thy Name . - Romans 15:13 He sealeth up as it were all the former treatise with prayers , wishing all that to be given them of the Lord , that he had commanded them . - Romans 15:13 In whom we hope . - Romans 15:13 Abundantly and plentifully . - Romans 15:14 The conclusion of the Epistle , wherein he first excuseth himself , that he hath written somewhat at large unto them , rather to warn them , than to teach them , and that of necessity , by reason of his vocation , which bindeth him peculiarly to the Gentiles . - Romans 15:14 Of your own accord , and of yourselves . - Romans 15:16 By the offering up of the Gentiles , he meaneth the Gentiles themselves , whom he offered to God as a sacrifice . - Romans 15:17 He commendeth his Apostleship highly by the effects , but yet so that moreover and besides that he speaketh all things truly , he giveth all the glory to God as the only author : and doth not properly respect himself , but this rather : that men might less doubt of the truth of the doctrine which he propoundeth unto them . - Romans 15:18 Christ was so with me in all things , and by all means , that if I would never so fain , yet I can not say , what he hath done by me to bring the Gentiles to obey the Gospel . - Romans 15:19 In the first place this word , Power , signifieth the force , and working of the wonders in piercing men ’ s minds : and in the latter , it signifieth God ’ s mighty power which was the worker of those wonders . - Romans 15:22 He writeth at large to the Romans , and that familiarly , his singular good will towards them , and the state of his affairs , but so , that he swerveth not an iota from the end of Apostolical doctrine : for he declareth nothing but that which appertaineth to his office , and is godly : and commending by a little digression as it were , the liberality of the Churches of Macedonia , he provoketh them modestly to follow their godly deed . - Romans 15:25 Doing , his duty for the Saints , to carry them that money which was gathered for their use . - Romans 15:27 Alms are voluntary , but yet such as we owe by the law of charity . - Romans 15:27 To serve the turns . - Romans 15:28 Performed it faithfully , and sealed it as it were with my ring . - Romans 15:28 This money which was gathered for the use of the poor : which alms is very fitly called fruit . - Romans 15:29 He promiseth them through the blessing of God , not to come empty unto them : and requiring of them the duty of prayers , he showeth what thing we ought chiefly to rest upon in all difficulties and adversities . - Romans 15:30 For that mutual communion , wherewith the holy Ghost hath tied our hearts and minds together .

GNV	Romans	16	25	( E ) [ q ] To him now that is of power to establish you according to my Gospel , and preaching of Jesus Christ , ( F ) by the revelation of the [ r ] mystery , which was kept secret since the world began :

GNV	Romans	16	27	To God , I say , only wise , be praise through Jesus Christ for ever . Amen . Written to the Romans from Corinth , and sent by Phoebe , servant of the Church which is at Cenchrea . Footnotes - Romans 16:1 Having made an end of the whole disputation , he cometh now to familiar commendations and salutations , and that to good consideration and purpose , to wit , that the Romans might know , who are most to be honored and made account of amongst them , and also whom they ought to set before them to follow : and therefore he attributeth unto every of them peculiar and singular testimonies . - Romans 16:2 For Christ ’ s sake , which is proper to the Christians , for the heathen Philosophers have resemblances of the same virtues . - Romans 16:5 The company of the faithful , for in so great a city as that was , there were divers companies . - Romans 16:5 For he was the first of Achaia that believed in Christ : and this kind of speech is an allusion to the ceremonies of the Law . - Romans 16:7 Ingrafted by faith . - Romans 16:16 He calleth that an holy kiss , which proceedeth from an heart that is full of that holy love : now this is to be referred to the manner used in those days . - Romans 16:17 As by namely describing them , which were worthy of commendation , he sufficiently declared when they ought to hear and follow , so doth he now point out unto them whom they ought to take heed of , yet he nameth them not , for that it was not needful . - Romans 16:17 Warily and diligently , as though you should scout out for your enemies in a watch tower . - Romans 16:18 The word which he useth , signifieth a promising which performeth nothing , and if thou hearest any such , thou mayest assure thyself that he that promiseth thee is more careful of thy matters , than of his own . - Romans 16:19 Simplicity must be joined with wisdom . - Romans 16:19 Furnished with the knowledge of the truth , and wisdom , that you may embrace good things , and eschew evil , beware of the deceits and snares of false prophets , and resist them openly : and this place doth plainly destroy the Papists ’ faith of credit , whereas they maintain it to be sufficient for one man to believe as another man believeth , without further knowledge , or examination what the matter is , or what ground it hath : using these daily speeches , We believe as our fathers believed , and we believe as the Church believeth . - Romans 16:19 As men that know no way to deceive , much less to deceive in deed . - Romans 16:20 We must fight , with a certain hope of victory . - Romans 16:21 He annexeth salutations , partly to renew mutual friendship , and partly to the end that this Epistle might be of some weight with the Romans , having the confirmation of so many that subscribed unto it . - Romans 16:22 Wrote it as Paul uttered it . - Romans 16:24 Now taking his leave of them this third time , he wisheth that unto them , whereupon dependeth all the force of the former doctrine . - Romans 16:25 He setteth forth the power and wisdom of God with great thanksgiving , which especially appears in the Gospel , and maketh mention also of the calling of the Gentiles to confirm the Romans in the hope of this salvation . - Romans 16:25 That secret and hidden thing , that is to say , the calling of the Gentiles . - Romans 16:26 Offered and exhibited to all nations to be known .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	[ t ] Now I beseech you , brethren , by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that [ u ] ye all speak one thing , and that there be no dissensions among you : but be ye [ v ] knit together in one mind , and in one judgment .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now [ x ] this I say , that every one of you saith , I am Paul ’ s , and I am ( G ) Apollos ’ s , and I am Cephas ’ s and I am Christ ’ s .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	[ ac ] For CHRIST sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Gospel , [ ad ] not with ( I ) [ ae ] wisdom of words , lest the [ af ] cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise ? where is the [ aj ] Scribe ? where is the [ ak ] disputer of this world ? hath not God made the wisdom of this world foolishness ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified : unto the Jews , even a stumbling block , and unto the Grecians , foolishness :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	[ d ] Unto the Church of God , which is at Corinth , to them that are ( A ) [ e ] sanctified in [ f ] Christ Jesus , ( B ) Saints by [ g ] calling , ( C ) with all that [ h ] call on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both their Lord , and ours :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	[ i ] Grace be with you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	[ j ] I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God , which is given you in Jesus Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	That in all things ye are made rich in him [ k ] in [ l ] all kind of speech , and in all knowledge :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	[ m ] As the testimony of Jesus Christ hath been [ n ] confirmed in you :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	So that ye are not destitute of any gift : ( D ) [ o ] waiting for the [ p ] appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	( E ) [ q ] Who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be [ r ] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	( F ) God is [ s ] faithful , by whom ye are called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	[ w ] For it hath been declared unto me , my brethren , of you by them that are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	[ y ] Is Christ divided ? was [ z ] Paul crucified for you ? either were ye [ aa ] baptized into the name of Paul ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	[ ab ] I thank God , that I baptized none of you , but ( H ) Crispus , and Gaius ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say , that I had baptized into mine own name .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	I baptized also the household of Stephanas : furthermore know I not , whether I baptized any other .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For that [ ag ] preaching of the cross is to them that perish , foolishness : but unto us , which are saved , it is the ( J ) [ ah ] power of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	[ ai ] For it is written , ( K ) I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will cast away the understanding of the prudent .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	[ al ] For seeing the [ am ] world by wisdom knew not God in the [ an ] wisdom of GOD , [ ao ] it pleased God by the [ ap ] foolishness of preaching to save them that believe :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	( L ) [ aq ] Seeing also that the Jews require a sign , and the Grecians seek after wisdom .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But unto them which are called , both of the Jews and Grecians , we preach Christ , the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	[ ar ] For brethren , you see your [ as ] calling , how that not many wise men [ at ] after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble are called .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise , and God hath chosen the weak things of the world , to confound the mighty things ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And vile things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , and things which [ au ] are not , to bring to [ av ] nought things that are .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	That no [ aw ] flesh should rejoice in his presence .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But ye are [ ax ] of him in Christ Jesus , [ ay ] who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	That , according as it is written , ( M ) [ az ] He that rejoiceth , let him rejoice in the Lord . Footnotes -

GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	Neither stood my word , and my preaching in the ( C ) enticing speech of man ’ s wisdom , [ e ] but in plain [ f ] evidence of the Spirit and of power .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	[ k ] But we speak the wisdom of God in a [ l ] mystery , even the hid wisdom , [ m ] which God had determined before the world , unto our glory .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	[ y ] Which things also we speak , not in the ( E ) words which man ’ s wisdom teacheth , but which the holy Ghost teacheth , [ z ] comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	[ aa ] But the [ ab ] natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him , neither can he know them , because they are [ ac ] spiritually discerned .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	( B ) And I was among you in [ d ] weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	[ g ] That your faith should not be in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	, and it is thus : the words must be applied to the matter , and the matter must be set forth with words which are meet and convenient for it : now this wisdom is spiritual and not of man , and therefore it must be delivered by a spiritual kind of teaching , and not by enticing words of man ’ s eloquence , that the simple , and yet wonderful majesty of the holy Ghost may therein appear . -
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	[ n ] Which none of the princes of this world hath known : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the [ o ] Lord of glory .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	[ p ] But as it is written , ( D ) The things which eye hath not seen , neither ear hath heard , neither came into [ q ] man ’ s heart , are , which God hath prepared for them that love him .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	[ r ] But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the spirit [ s ] searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	[ t ] For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the [ u ] spirit of a man , which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have receiveth not the [ v ] spirit of the world , but the Spirit , which is of God , [ w ] that we might [ x ] know the things that are given to us of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	[ ad ] But he that is spiritual , [ ae ] discerneth all things : yet [ af ] he himself is judged of [ ag ] no man .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one saith , I am Paul ’ s , and another , I am Apollos ’ s , are ye not carnal ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	[ g ] I have planted , Apollos watered , but God gave the increase .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God given to me , as a skillful master builder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon : [ i ] but let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	( B ) [ n ] Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	[ p ] Let no man deceive himself : If any man among you seem to be wise in this world , let him be a fool , that he may be wise .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	, first warning the hearers , that henceforward they esteem not as lords , those whom God hath appointed to be ministers , and not lords of their salvation , which thing they do , that depend upon men , and not upon God , that speaketh by them . -
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	[ f ] Who is Paul then ? and who is Apollos , but the ministers by whom ye believed , and as the Lord gave to every man ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then , neither is he that planteth anything , neither he that watereth , but God that giveth the increase .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	And he that planteth , and he that watereth , are one , ( A ) and every man shall receive his wages , according to his labor .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we together are God ’ s [ h ] laborers : ye are God ’ s husbandry , and God ’ s building .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	[ j ] For other foundation can no man lay , than that which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	[ l ] Every man ’ s work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by the fire : and the fire shall try every man ’ s work of what sort it is .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any man ’ s work , that he hath built upon , abide , he shall receive wages .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man ’ s work burn , he shall lose , but [ m ] he shall be saved himself : nevertheless yet as it were by the fire .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any man [ o ] destroy the Temple of God , him shall God destroy : for the Temple of God is holy , which ye are .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God : for it is written , ( C ) He [ q ] catcheth the wise in their own craftiness .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	[ m ] For who separateth thee ? and what hast thou , that thou hast not received ? if thou hast received it , why rejoicest thou , as though [ n ] thou hadst not received it ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us the last Apostles , as men appointed to death , for we are made a [ p ] gassing stock unto the world , and to the Angels , and to men .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ ’ s sake , and ye are wise in Christ : we are weak , and ye are strong : ye are honorable , and we are despised .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Unto this hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwelling place ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy , which is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , which shall put you in remembrance of my [ s ] ways in Christ as I teach everywhere in every Church .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	[ c ] And as for the rest , it is required of the disposers , that every man be found faithful .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	[ d ] As touching me , I pass very little to be judged of you , [ e ] or of man ’ s [ f ] judgment : no , [ g ] I judge not mine own self .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	[ i ] Therefore ( A ) judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who will lighten things that are hid in darkness , and make the counsels of the hearts manifest : and then shall every man have [ j ] praise of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	[ k ] Now these things , brethren , I have figuratively applied unto mine own self and Apollos , for your sakes , that ye might learn [ l ] by us , that no man presume above that which is written , that one swell not against another for any man ’ s cause .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	[ o ] Now ye are full : now ye are made rich : ye reign as kings without us , and would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	( C ) We are evil spoken of , and we pray : we are made as the [ q ] filth of the world , the offscouring of all things , unto this time .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	[ r ] I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved children I admonish you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore , I pray you , be followers of me .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	[ t ] Some are puffed up as though I would not come unto you .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	[ b ] And ye are puffed up , and have not rather sorrowed , that he which hath done this deed , might be put from among you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	[ j ] Your rejoicing [ k ] is not good : know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	And not [ q ] altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or with extortioners , or with idolaters : for then ye must go out of the world .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	[ r ] For what have I to do to judge them also which are without ? do ye not judge them that are within ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	[ c ] For I verily as absent in body , but present in [ d ] spirit , have determined already as though I were present , that he that hath thus done this thing ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	When ye are gathered together , and my spirit , in the [ e ] Name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that such one , I say , [ f ] by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	[ l ] Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new [ m ] lump , as ye are unleavened : for Christ our [ n ] Passover is sacrificed for us .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the [ o ] feast , not with old leaven , neither in the leaven of maliciousness and wickedness : but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	[ p ] I wrote unto you in an Epistle , that ye should not company together with fornicators ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written unto you , that ye company not together : if any that is called a brother , be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner , with such one eat not .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? [ m ] Be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor wantons , nor buggerers ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	[ e ] Do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the world ? If the world then shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge the Angels ? how much more things that pertain to this life ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	[ f ] If then ye have [ g ] judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them up which are [ h ] least esteemed in the Church .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	[ i ] I speak it to your shame . Is it so that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one , that can judge between his brethren ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	[ j ] Now therefore there is altogether [ k ] infirmity in you , that ye go to law one with another : ( A ) [ l ] why rather suffer ye not wrong ? why rather sustain ye not harm ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	( B ) Nay , ye yourselves do wrong , and do harm , and that to your brethren .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	Nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor railers , nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such were ( C ) some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified , in the [ n ] Name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	¶ ( D ) [ o ] [ p ] All things are lawful unto me , but all things are not profitable . I may do all things , but I will not be brought under the [ q ] power of any thing .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	[ r ] Meats are ordained for the belly , and the belly for the meats : but God shall destroy both it , and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God hath also raised up the Lord , and ( E ) shall raise us up by his power .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	[ s ] Know ye not , that your bodies are the members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	[ t ] Do ye not know , that he which coupleth himself with an harlot , is one body ? ( F ) for [ u ] two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord , is one spirit .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	[ v ] Flee fornication : every sin that a man doeth , is without the body : but he that commiteth fornication , sinneth against his own body .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	[ i ] But I speak this by permission , not by commandment .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	[ k ] Therefore I say unto the [ l ] unmarried , and unto the widows , It is good for them if they abide even as I do .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not abstain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to [ m ] burn .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled unto her husband , and let not the husband put away his wife .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	[ o ] But to the remnant I speak , and not the Lord , If any brother have a wife that believeth not , if she be content to dwell with him , let him not forsake her .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , if he be content to dwell with her , let her not forsake him .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	[ p ] For the unbelieving husband is [ q ] sanctified to the [ r ] wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified to the [ s ] husband , else were your children unclean : but now are they [ t ] holy .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	[ u ] But if the unbelieving depart , let him depart : a brother or a sister is not in subjection in [ v ] such things : [ w ] but God hath called us in peace .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thine husband ? Or what knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	[ x ] But as God hath distributeth to every man , as the Lord [ y ] hath called every one , so let him walk : and so ordain I in all Churches .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Art thou called being a servant ? [ ab ] care not for it : but if yet thou mayest be free , use it rather .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the [ ac ] Lord , being a servant , is the Lord ’ s freeman : likewise also he that is called being free , is Christ ’ s servant .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	( D ) [ ad ] Ye are bought with a price : be not the servants of men .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	[ ae ] Brethren , let every man , wherein he was called , therein abide with [ af ] God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose then [ aj ] this to be good for the [ ak ] present necessity : I mean that it is good for a man so to be .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed : art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if thou takest a wife , thou sinnest not : and if a virgin marry , she sinneth not : nevertheless , such shall have trouble in the [ al ] flesh : but I [ am ] spare you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	And this I say , brethren , because the time is [ an ] short , hereafter that both they which have wives , be as though they had none :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	And they that [ ao ] weep , as though they wept not : and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not : and they that buy , as though they possessed not :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this [ ap ] world , as though they used it not : for the [ aq ] fashion of this world goeth away .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	And I would have you without care . The unmarried careth for things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But he that is married , [ ar ] careth for the things of the world , how he may please his wife .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	There is difference also between a virgin and a wife : the unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy , both in body and in [ as ] spirit : but she that is married , careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	[ au ] But if any man think that it is uncomely for his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he [ av ] sinneth not : let them be married .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless , he that standeth firm in his [ aw ] heart , that he hath no [ ax ] need , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart , that he will keep his virgin , he doeth well .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God , the same is known of him .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	[ e ] Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed unto [ f ] idols , we know that an idol is [ g ] nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For though there be that are called gods , whether in heaven , or in earth ( as there be many gods , and many lords . )
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	Yet unto us there is but one God , which is that Father , [ h ] of whom are all things , and we [ i ] in him , and ( A ) [ j ] one Lord Jesus Christ , [ k ] by whom are all things , and we by him .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	, for there is a kind of taunt in it , as we may perceive by the next verse . -
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this power of yours be an occasion of falling , to them that are weak .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	[ p ] For if any man see thee which hast knowledge , sit at table in the idols ’ temple , shall not the conscience of him which is weak , be boldened , to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	[ r ] Now when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians 9:27 This word ( Reproved ) is not set as contrary to the word ( Elect ) but as contrary to the word ( Approved ) when we see one by experience not to be such an one as he ought to be . Geneva Bible ,

GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things : [ w ] neither wrote I these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my rejoicing vain .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I become as weak , that I may win the weak : I am made all things to [ z ] all men , that I might by all means save some .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	[ e ] My defense to him that [ f ] examine me , is this ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	[ g ] Have we not power to [ h ] eat and to drink ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Or have we not power to lead about a wife being a [ i ] sister , as well as the rest of the Apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power [ j ] not to work ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	[ k ] Who [ l ] goeth a warfare any time at his own cost ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	[ m ] Say I these things [ n ] according to man ? saith not the Law the same also ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Either saith he it not altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes no doubt it is written , that he which eareth , should ear in hope , and that he that thresheth in hope , should be partaker of his hope .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	( B ) [ p ] If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	[ q ] If others with you be partakers of this [ r ] power , are not we rather ? nevertheless , we have not used this power : but suffer all things , that we should not hinder the Gospel of Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	[ s ] Do ye not know , that they which minister about the ( C ) holy things , eat of the [ t ] things of the Temple ? and they which wait at the altar , are [ u ] partakers with the altar ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	So also hath the Lord ordained , that they which preach the Gospel , should live [ v ] of the Gospel .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For though I preach the Gospel , I have nothing to rejoice of : for necessity is laid upon me , and woe is unto me , if I preach not the Gospel .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do it willingly , I have a reward , but if I do it against my will , notwithstanding the dispensation is committed unto me .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all men , that I may win the more .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	( D ) And unto the Jews , I become as a Jew , that I may win the Jews : to them that are under the [ y ] Law , as though I were under the Law , that I may win them that are under the Law :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To them that are without Law , as though I were without Law , ( when I am not without Law as pertaining to God , but am in the Law through Christ ) that I may win them that are without Law :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the Gospel ’ s sake , that I might be partaker thereof with [ aa ] you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And every man that proveth masteries , [ ac ] abstaineth from all things : and they do it to obtain a corruptible crown : but we for an incorruptible .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run , not as uncertainly : so fight I , not as one that beateth the air .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed fornication , and fell in one ( H ) day three and twenty thousand .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt [ l ] Christ , as some of them also tempted him , and ( I ) were destroyed of serpents .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	[ n ] Wherefore , let him that thinketh he standeth , take heed lest he fall .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you , but such as appertaineth to [ o ] man : and God is faithful , which will not suffer you to be tempted above that you be able , but will even [ p ] give the issue with the temptation , that ye may be able to bear it .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	[ q ] I speak as unto them which have understanding : judge ye what I say .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of [ r ] blessing which we bless , is it not the [ s ] communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For we that are many , are one bread and one body , because we all are partakers of one bread .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel , which is after the [ t ] flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices [ u ] partakers of the Altar ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What say I then ? that the idol is anything ? or that that which is sacrificed to idols , is anything ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	Nay , but that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not unto God : and I would not that ye should have [ v ] fellowship with the devils .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord , and the [ w ] cup of the devils . Ye can not be partakers of the Lord ’ s table , and of the table of the devils .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	[ z ] Whatsoever is sold in the [ aa ] shambles , eat ye , and ask no question for conscience sake .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	( L ) For the earth is the Lord ’ s , and [ ab ] all that therein is .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For every man when they should eat , taketh his own supper [ x ] afore , and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	[ z ] For I have received of the Lord that which I also have delivered unto you , to wit , That the Lord Jesus in the night when he was betrayed , took bread .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	[ a ] Now brethren , I commend you , that ye remember all my things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	[ b ] But I will that ye know , that Christ is the ( B ) head of every man : and the man is the woman ’ s head : and God is [ c ] Christ ’ s head .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	[ f ] But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth bareheaded , dishonoreth her head : [ g ] for it is even one very thing , as though she were shaven .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	[ h ] For a man ought not to cover his head : forasmuch as he is the ( C ) image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	[ i ] For the man is not of the woman , but the woman of the man .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	( D ) [ j ] For the man was not created for the woman ’ s sake : but the woman for the man ’ s sake .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	[ k ] Therefore ought the woman to have [ l ] power on her head , because of the [ m ] Angels .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man , so is the man also by the woman : but all things are of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	[ p ] Judge in yourselves , Is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doth not nature itself teach you , that if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair , it is a praise unto her : for her hair is given her for a [ q ] covering .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	[ r ] But if any man list to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the Churches of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	¶ [ s ] Now in this that I declare , I praise you not , that ye come together , not with profit , but with hurt .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	[ t ] For first of all , when ye come together in the Church , I hear that there are dissensions among you : and I believe it to be true in some part .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	[ u ] For there must be heresies even among you , that they which are [ v ] approved among you , might be known .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When ye come together therefore into one place , this is [ w ] not to eat the Lord ’ s Supper .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	[ y ] Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? despise ye the Church of God , and shame them that have not ? what shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	( E ) And when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is [ aa ] broken for you : this do ye in remembrance of me .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	After the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the New Testament in my blood : this do as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye shall eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye show the Lord ’ s death till he come .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	[ ab ] Wherefore , whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink the cup of the Lord [ ac ] unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	( F ) [ ad ] Let [ ae ] every man therefore examine himself , and so let them eat of this bread , and drink of this cup .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh his own damnation , because he [ af ] discerneth not the Lord ’ s body .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	[ ag ] For this cause many are weak , and sick among you , and many sleep .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	For if we would [ ah ] judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , because we should not be condemned with the world .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	[ ai ] Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	[ aj ] And if any man be hungry , let him eat at home , that ye come not together unto condemnation . [ ak ] Other things will I set in order when I come . Footnotes -

Geneva Bible ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	[ r ] For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of the body , which is one , though they be many , yet are but one body : [ s ] even so is [ t ] Christ .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is [ j ] given to every man , to [ k ] profit withal .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now are there many members , yet but one body .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	[ c ] Ye know that ye were [ d ] Gentiles , and were carried away unto the dumb idols , as ye were led .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	[ e ] Wherefore I declare unto you , that no man ( A ) speaking by the spirit of God , calleth Jesus ( B ) [ f ] execrable : also no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the holy Ghost .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	[ g ] Now there are diversities of gifts , but the [ h ] same Spirit .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are diversities of administrations , but the same Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of [ i ] operations , but God is the same which worketh all in all .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	[ l ] For to one is given by the Spirit the word of [ m ] wisdom : and to another the word of knowledge , by the same Spirit :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	And to another is given faith by the same Spirit : and to another the gifts of healing , by the same Spirit :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	And to another the [ n ] operations of great works : and to another , [ o ] prophecy : and to another , the [ p ] discerning of spirits : and to another , diversities of tongues : and to another , the interpretation of tongues .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	( C ) And all these things worketh one and the selfsame Spirit , distributing to every man severally [ q ] as he will .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into [ u ] one body , whether we be Jews , or Grecians , whether we be bond , or free , and have been all made to [ v ] drink into one Spirit .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	[ w ] For the body also is not one member , but many .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	[ x ] If the foot would say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body , is it therefore not of the body ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear would say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body , is it therefore not of the body ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	[ y ] If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God disposed the members every one of them in the body at his own pleasure .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	For if they were all one member , where were the body ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	[ z ] And the eye can not say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor the head again to the feet , I have no need of you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Yea , much rather those members of the body , which seem to be [ aa ] more feeble , are necessary .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And upon those members of the body , which we think most unhonest , put we more [ ab ] honesty on : and our uncomely parts have more comeliness on .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts need it not : but God hath tempered the body together : and hath given the more honor to that part which lacked ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	Lest there should be any division in the body : but that the members should have the same [ ac ] care one for another .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	[ ad ] Therefore if one member suffer , all suffer with it : if one member be had in honor , all the members rejoice with it .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ , and members for your [ ae ] part .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	( D ) And God hath ordained some in the Church : as first Apostles , secondly Prophets , thirdly teachers , then them that do miracles : after that , the gifts of healing , [ af ] helpers , [ ag ] governors , diversity of tongues .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all Apostles ? are all Prophets ? are all teachers ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Are all doers of miracles ? have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	[ ah ] But desire you the best gifts , and I will yet show you a more excellent way . Footnotes -

And among these , charity is the chiefest , because it ceaseth not in the life to come as the rest do , but is perfected and accomplished . For seeing that faith and hope tend to things which are promised , and are to come , when we have presently gotten them , to what purpose should we have faith and hope ? but yet there at length shall we truly and perfectly love both God , and one another . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	[ p ] And now abideth faith , hope and love , even these three : but the chiefest of these is love . Footnotes -

GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	[ e ] Love [ f ] suffereth long : it is bountiful : love envieth not : love doth not boast itself : it is not puffed up :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And though I had the gift of prophecy , and knew all secrets and all knowledge , yea , if I had all [ d ] faith , so that I could remove ( A ) mountains , and had not love , I were nothing .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And though I feed the poor with all my goods , and though I give my body , that I be burned , and have not love , it profiteth me nothing .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	It doth [ g ] no uncomely thing : it seeketh not her own thing : it is not provoked to anger : it thinketh no evil :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	It rejoiceth not in iniquity , but [ h ] rejoiceth in the truth :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	It suffereth all things : it believeth all things : it hopeth all things : it endureth all things .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	[ i ] Love doth never fall away , though that prophesyings be abolished , or the tongues cease , or [ j ] knowledge vanish away .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	[ k ] For we know in [ l ] part , and we prophesy in part .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect , is come , then that which is in part shall be abolished .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	[ m ] When I was a child , I spake as a child : I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	[ n ] For [ o ] now we see through a glass darkly : but then shall we see face to face . Now I know in part : but then shall I know even as I am known .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	[ h ] Moreover things without life which give a sound , whether it be a pipe or an harp , except they make a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	[ l ] Even so , forasmuch as ye covet spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel unto the edifying of the Church .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	( C ) [ ah ] Let your women keep silence in the Churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak : but they ought to be subject , as also ( D ) the Law saith .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	[ c ] For he that speaketh a strange [ d ] tongue , speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man heareth him : howbeit in the [ e ] spirit he speaketh secret things .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth , speaketh unto men to [ f ] edifying , and to exhortation , and to comfort .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh strange language , edifieth himself : but he that prophesieth , edifieth the [ g ] Church .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spake strange languages , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth , than he that speaketh diverse tongues , except he expound it , that the Church may receive edification .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	And now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking diverse tongues , what shall I profit you , except I speak to you , either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And also if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to battle ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So likewise you , by the tongue , except ye utter words that have [ i ] signification , how shall it be understood what is spoken ? for ye shall speak in the air .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	[ j ] There are so many kinds of voices ( as it cometh to pass ) in the world , and none of them is dumb .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	Except I know then the power of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a Barbarian , and he that [ k ] speaketh , shall be a Barbarian unto me .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore , let him that speaketh a strange tongue , [ m ] pray that he may interpret .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , but I will pray with the [ r ] understanding also : I will sing with the spirit : but I will sing with the understanding also .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	[ s ] Else , when thou blessest with the [ t ] spirit , how shall he that [ u ] occupieth the room of the unlearned , say [ v ] Amen , at thy giving of thanks , seeing he knowest not what thou sayest ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	[ w ] I thank my God , I speak languages more than ye all .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	Yet had I rather in the Church to speak [ x ] five words with mine understanding , that I might also instruct others , than ten thousand words in a strange tongue .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	[ y ] Brethren , be not ( A ) children in understanding , but as concerning maliciousness be children , but in understanding be of a ripe age .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the [ z ] Law it is written , ( B ) By men of other tongues , and by other languages will I speak unto this people : yet so shall they not hear me , saith the Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	[ aa ] Wherefore strange tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	[ ab ] If therefore , when the whole Church is come together in one , and all speak strange tongues , there come in they that are [ ac ] unlearned , or they which believe not , will they not say , that ye are out of your wits ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is rebuked of all men , and is judged of all ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	And so are the secrets of his heart made manifest , and so he will fall down on his face and worship God , and say plainly that God is in you indeed .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	[ ad ] What is to be done then , brethren ? when ye come together , according as every one of you hath a Psalm , or hath doctrine , or hath a tongue , or hath revelation , or hath interpretation , let all things be done unto edifying .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	[ ae ] If any man speak a strange tongue , let it be by two , or at the most , by three , and that by course , and let one interpret .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the Church , which speaketh languages , and let him speak to himself , and to God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	[ af ] Let the Prophets speak , two or three , and let the others judge .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	And if anything be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may have comfort .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	And the [ ag ] spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as we see in all the Churches of the Saints .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	And if they will learn anything , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the Church .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	[ ai ] Came the word of God out from you ? either came it unto you only ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If any man think himself to be a Prophet , or [ aj ] spiritual , let him acknowledge , that the things that I write unto you , are the commandments of the Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	[ ak ] And if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	[ al ] Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak languages .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done honestly , and by order . Footnotes -

GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For first of all , I delivered unto you that which I received , how that Christ died for our sins , according to the ( B ) Scriptures ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	, of the Trinity . -
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	( F ) For I am the least of the Apostles , which am not meet to be called an Apostle , because I persecuted the Church of God .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	¶ [ g ] Now if it be preached , that Christ is risen from the dead , how say some among you , that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The [ y ] last enemy that shall be destroyed , is death .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	[ ab ] Else what shall they do which are baptized [ ac ] for dead ? if the dead rise not at all , why are they then baptized for dead ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	[ af ] If I have fought with beasts at Ephesus [ ag ] after the manner of men , what advantageth it me , if the dead be not raised up ? ( L ) [ ah ] let us [ ai ] eat and drink : for tomorrow we shall die .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	[ ak ] But some man will say , How are the dead raised up ? and with what body come they forth ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	[ as ] As it is also written , The [ at ] first man ( M ) Adam was made a living soul : and the last Adam was made a [ au ] quickening spirit .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth , [ aw ] earthly : the second man is the Lord from [ ax ] heaven .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	[ bc ] Behold , I show you a [ bd ] secret thing , We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	O death where is thy sting ? O grave where is thy victory ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	( P ) But thanks be unto God , which hath given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	[ bf ] Therefore my beloved brethren , be ye steadfast , unmovable , abundant always in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the [ bg ] Lord . Footnotes -
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	And whereby ye are saved , if ye keep in memory , after what manner I preached it unto you , [ c ] except ye have believed in vain .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried , and that he arose the third day , according to the ( C ) Scriptures ,
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	( D ) And that he was seen of Cephas , then of the [ d ] twelve .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , he was seen of more than five hundred brethren at [ e ] once : whereof many remain unto this present , and some also are asleep .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that , he was seen of James : then of all the Apostles .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	( G ) But by the grace of God I am that I am : and his grace which is in me , was not in vain : but I labored more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which is with me .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Wherefore , whether it were I , or they , so we preach , and so have ye believed .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	[ h ] For if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	[ i ] And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	[ j ] For if the dead be not raised , then is Christ not raised .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain : [ k ] ye are [ l ] yet in your sins .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	[ m ] And so they which are asleep in Christ , are perished .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	[ n ] If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men the most miserable .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	[ o ] But now is Christ risen from the dead , [ p ] and was made the ( H ) [ q ] firstfruits of them that slept .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	[ r ] For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be [ s ] made alive .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	[ t ] But every man in his ( I ) own order : the firstfruits is Christ , afterward , they that are of Christ , at his coming shall rise again .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	[ u ] Then shall be the [ v ] end , when he hath delivered up the kingdom to God , even the Father , when he hath put down [ w ] all rule , and all authority and power .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign ( J ) till he hath put all his enemies [ x ] under his feet .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	( K ) For he hath put down all things under his feet . ( And when he saith that all things are subdued to him , it is manifest that he is excepted , which did put down all things under him . )
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him , [ z ] then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him , that did subdue all things under him , that [ aa ] God may be all in all .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	[ ad ] Why are we also in jeopardy every hour ?
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	By your [ ae ] rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	[ aj ] Be not deceived : evil speakings corrupt good manners .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake to live righteously , and sin not : for some have not the knowledge of God , I speak this to your shame .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	[ al ] O fool , that which thou sowest , is not quickened , except it die .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare corn as it falleth , of wheat , or of some other .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	[ am ] But God giveth it a body at his pleasure , even to every seed his own body .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , and another flesh of beasts , and another of fishes , and another of birds :
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies , and earthly bodies : but the glory of the heavenly is one , and the glory of the earthly is another .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is another glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	[ an ] So also is the resurrection of the dead . The body is [ ao ] sown in corruption , and is raised in incorruption .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in [ ap ] dishonor , and is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness , and is raised in [ aq ] power .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	[ ar ] It is sown a natural body , and is raised a spiritual body : there is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	[ av ] Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual : but that which is natural , and afterward that which is spiritual .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	[ ay ] As is the earthly , such are they that are earthly : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And as we have born the [ az ] image of the earthly , so shall we bear the image of the heavenly .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	[ ba ] This say I , brethren , that [ bb ] flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God , neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	In [ be ] a moment , in the twinkling of an eye at the last ( N ) trumpet : for the trumpet shall blow , and the dead shall be raised up incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption : and this mortal must put on immortality .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible hath put on incorruption , and this mortal hath put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying , that is written , ( O ) Death is swallowed up into victory .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin : and the strength of sin is the Law .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians 16:22 By these words , are betokened the [ secret ] kind of curse and excommunication that was amongst the Jews : and the words are as much as to say , as our Lord cometh : So that his meaning may be this , Let him be accursed even to the coming of the Lord , that is to say , to his death ’ s day , even for ever .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	10	¶ Now if Timothy come , see that he be [ g ] without fear with you : for he worketh the work of the Lord , even as I do .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	13	¶ Watch ye : stand fast in the faith : quit you like men , and be strong .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The Churches of Asia salute you : Aquila and Priscilla with the Church that is in their house , salute you greatly in the Lord .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	2	Every [ b ] first day of the week , let every one of you put aside by himself , and lay up as God hath [ c ] prospered him , that then there be no gatherings when I come .

GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now in my passage , but I trust to abide a while with you , if the Lord permit .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	8	And I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and [ f ] effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him : but convey him forth [ h ] in peace , that he may come unto me : for I looked for him with the brethren .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	12	As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his mind was not at all to come at this time : howbeit he will come when he shall have convenient time .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done in love .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Now brethren , I beseech you ( ye know the house of [ i ] Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have [ j ] given themselves to minister unto the Saints . )
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas , and Fortunatus , and Achaicus : for they have supplied the want of you .
GNV	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they have comforted my [ l ] spirit and yours : [ m ] acknowledge therefore such men .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	[ i ] For brethren , we would not have you ignorant of our affliction , which came unto us in Asia , how we were pressed out of measure passing strength , so that we altogether [ j ] doubted even of life .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so [ l ] great a death , and doth deliver us : in whom we trust , that yet hereafter he will deliver us .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	[ w ] When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ? or mind I those things which I mind , according to the [ x ] flesh , that with me should be , [ y ] Yea , yea , and Nay , nay ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	( A ) [ b ] [ c ] Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of [ d ] mercies , and the God of all comfort ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	Which comforteth us in all our tribulation , [ e ] that we may be able to comfort them which are in any affliction by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as the [ f ] sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation aboundeth through Christ .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	[ g ] And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is [ h ] wrought in the enduring of the same sufferings , which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope is steadfast concerning you , in as much as we know , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Yea , we received the sentence of death in [ k ] ourselves , because we should not rest in ourselves , but in God , which raised the dead .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	( B ) [ m ] So that ye labor together in prayer for us , [ n ] that for the gift bestowed upon us for many , thanks may be given by many persons for us .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	[ o ] For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly [ p ] pureness , and not in fleshly wisdom , but by the [ q ] grace of God we have had our conversation in the world , and most of all to youwards .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write [ r ] none other things unto you , than that ye read or else that ye acknowledge , and I trust ye shall acknowledge unto the [ s ] end .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	Even as ye have acknowledged us partly , that we are your [ t ] rejoicing , even as ye are ours , in the [ u ] day of our Lord Jesus .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence was I minded first to come unto you , that ye might have had a [ v ] double grace ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia , unto you , and to be led forth toward Judea of you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	[ z ] Yea , God is [ aa ] faithful , that our word toward you , was not Yea , and Nay ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	[ ab ] For the Son of God Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , that is , by me , and Silvanus , and Timothy , [ ac ] was not Yea , and Nay : but in [ ad ] him it was Yea .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	[ ae ] For all the promises of God in him are Yea , and are in [ af ] him Amen , unto the glory of God through [ ag ] us .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	[ ah ] And it is God which established us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	Who hath also sealed us , and hath given the [ ai ] earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	[ aj ] Now , I call God for a record unto my [ ak ] soul , that to spare you , I came not as yet unto Corinth .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	[ al ] Not that we have dominion over your faith , but we are helpers of your [ am ] joy : for by faith ye stand . Footnotes -

GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	1	But I determined thus in myself , that I would not come again to you in [ a ] heaviness .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For in great affliction , and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears : not that ye should be made sorry , but that ye might perceive the love which I have , specially unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	[ c ] And if any hath caused sorrow , the same hath not made [ d ] me sorry , but [ e ] partly ( lest I should more [ f ] charge him ) you all .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	of the next chapter . -
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother , but took my leave of them , and went away into Macedonia .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same thing unto you , lest when I came , I should take heaviness of them of whom I ought to rejoice : this [ b ] confidence have I in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	So that now contrariwise ye ought rather to [ g ] forgive him , and comfort him , lest the same should be swallowed up with overmuch heaviness .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore , I pray you , that you would [ h ] confirm your love towards him .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For this cause also did I write : that I might know the proof of you , whether ye would be obedient in all things .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive anything , I forgive also : for verily if I forgave anything , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the [ i ] sight of Christ ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	Lest Satan should circumvent us : for we are not ignorant of his [ j ] enterprises .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	¶ [ k ] Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ ’ s Gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God , which always maketh us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the [ l ] savor of his knowledge by us in every place .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	[ m ] For we are unto God the sweet savor of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them which perish .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are the savor of death , unto death , and to the other the savor of life , unto life : [ n ] and who is sufficient for these things ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	( A ) For we are not as many , which make [ o ] merchandise of the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God in the sight of God speak we in Christ . Footnotes -
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Corinthians 3:18 Going forwards in the allegory of the covering , he compareth the Gospel to a glass , which although it be most bright and sparkling , yet doth it not only not dazzle their eyes , which look in it , as the law doth , but also transformeth them with its beams , so that they also be partakers of the glory and shining of it , to lighten others : as Christ said unto his , You are the light of the world , whereas he himself was the only light . We are also commanded in another place , to shine as candles before the world , because we are partakers of God ’ s Spirit . But Paul speaketh here properly , of the ministers of the Gospel , as it appeareth both by that that goeth before , and that that cometh after , and that , setting them his own example and his fellows . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	In that ye are [ a ] manifest , to be the Epistle of Christ , [ b ] ministered by us , and written , not with ink , but with the Spirit of the [ c ] living God , [ d ] not in tables of stone , but in fleshly tables of the heart .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	1	Do we begin to praise ourselves again ? or need we as some others , Epistles of recommendation unto you , or letters of recommendation from you ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	[ g ] Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament , not of the [ h ] letter , but of the Spirit : for the letter killeth , but the Spirit giveth life .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the [ k ] ministration of the Spirit be more glorious ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	( A ) [ o ] And we are not as Moses , which put a veil upon his face , that the children of Israel should not look unto the [ p ] end of that which should be abolished .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	[ r ] But we all behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord with open face , and are changed into the same image , from glory to glory , as by the Spirit of the Lord . Footnotes -
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such [ e ] trust have we through Christ to God :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to think anything , as of ourselves : but our [ f ] sufficiency is of God ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	If then the ministration of death written with letters [ i ] and engraven in stones , was [ j ] glorious , so that the children of Israel could not behold the face of Moses , for the glory of his countenance ( which glory is gone away . )
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious , much more doth the ministration of [ l ] righteousness exceed in glory .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was glorified , was not glorified in this point , that is , as touching the exceeding glory .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that they should be [ m ] abolished , was glorious , much more shall that which remaineth be glorious .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	[ n ] Seeing then that we have such trust , we use great boldness of speech .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	Therefore their minds are hardened : for until this day remaineth the same covering untaken away in the reading of the old Testament , which veil in Christ is put away .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the veil is laid over their hearts .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless when their heart shall be turned to the Lord , the veil shall be taken away .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the [ q ] Lord is the ( B ) Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	1	Therefore , [ a ] seeing that we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we [ b ] faint not :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	[ l ] But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , [ m ] that the excellency of that power might be of God , and not of us .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	[ n ] Everywhere we bear about in our body the [ o ] dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life of Jesus might also be made manifest in our bodies .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we faint not , [ w ] but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is [ x ] renewed daily .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our [ y ] light affliction which is but for a moment , causeth unto us a far most excellent and an eternal weight of [ z ] glory :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	[ e ] If the Gospel be then hid , it is hid to them that are lost .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	[ h ] For we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord , and ourselves your servants for [ i ] Jesus ’ sake .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God ( A ) [ j ] that commanded the light to shine out of darkness , is he which hath shined in our hearts , to give the [ k ] light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are afflicted on every side , yet are we not in distress : we are in doubt , but yet we despair not .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We are persecuted , but not forsaken : cast down , but we perish not .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we which [ p ] live , are always delivered unto death for Jesus ’ sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our [ q ] mortal flesh .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	[ r ] So then death worketh in us , and life in you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	[ s ] And because we have the same [ t ] spirit of faith , according as it is written , ( B ) I believed , and therefore have I spoken , we also believe , and therefore speak ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he which hath raised up the Lord Jesus , shall raise us up also by Jesus , and shall set us with you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	[ u ] For all things are for your sakes , [ v ] that that most plenteous grace by the thanksgiving of many , may redound to the praise of God .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	1	For [ a ] we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed , we have a building given of God , that is , an house not made with hands , but eternal in the heavens .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	. -
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	[ o ] For we praise not ourselves again unto you , but give you an occasion to rejoice of us that ye may have to answer against them , which rejoice in the [ p ] face , and not in the heart .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	[ r ] For that love of Christ [ s ] constraineth us ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	[ x ] Therefore if any man be in Christ , let him be a [ y ] new creature . ( C ) Old things are passed away : behold , all things are become new .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	[ d ] Because that if we be clothed , we shall not be found ( A ) naked .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we that are in this tabernacle , sigh and are burdened because we would not be unclothed , but would be clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	and
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	Nevertheless , we are [ i ] bold , and love rather to remove out of the body , and to dwell with the Lord .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore also we [ j ] covet , that both dwelling at home , and removing from home , we may be acceptable to him .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	( B ) [ k ] For we must all [ l ] appear before the judgment seat of Christ , that every man may receive the things which are done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or evil .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	[ m ] Knowing therefore that [ n ] terror of the Lord , we persuade men , and we are made manifest unto God , and I trust also that we are made manifest in your consciences .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	[ q ] For whether we be out of our wit , we are it to God : or whether we be in our right mind , we are it unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	Because we thus judge , that if [ t ] one be dead for all , then were all dead , and he died for all , that they which live , should not henceforth [ u ] live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	[ v ] Wherefore , henceforth know we no man after the flesh , [ w ] yea though we had known Christ after the flesh , yet not henceforth know we him no more .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	[ z ] And all things are of God , which hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given unto us the ministry of reconciliation .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	For God was in Christ , and reconciled the world to himself , not imputing their sins unto them , and hath [ aa ] committed to us the word of reconciliation .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Now then are we ambassadors for Christ : as though God did beseech you through us , we pray you in Christ ’ s stead , that ye be reconciled to God .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	6	1	So [ a ] we therefore as workers together beseech you , that ye receive not the grace of God in vain .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	In stripes , in prisons , in [ g ] tumults , in labors ,

GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	1	Seeing then we have these promises , dearly beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the [ a ] flesh and spirit , and finish our sanctification in the fear of God .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I use great boldness of speech toward you : I rejoice greatly in you : I am filled with comfort , and am exceeding joyous in all our tribulation .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	[ g ] For though I made you sorry with a letter , I repent not , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same Epistle made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For [ i ] godly sorrow causeth repentance unto salvation , not to be repented of : but the worldly sorrow causeth death .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I speak it not to your [ d ] condemnation : for I have said before , that ye are in our hearts , to die and live together .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side , fightings without , and terrors within .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , that comforteth the [ e ] abject , comforted us at the [ f ] coming of Titus :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	I now rejoice , not that ye were sorry , but that ye sorrowed to [ h ] repentance : for ye sorrowed godly , so that in nothing ye were hurt by us .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold , this thing that ye have been godly sorry , what great care hath it wrought in you : yea , what clearing of yourselves : yea , what indignation : yea , what fear : yea , how great desire : yea , what a zeal : yea , what revenge : in all things ye have showed yourselves , that ye are pure in this matter .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore , though I wrote unto you , I did not it for his cause that had done the wrong , neither for his cause that had the injury , but that our care toward you in the [ j ] sight of God might appear unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted , because ye were comforted : but rather we rejoiced much more for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if that I have boasted anything to him of you , I have not been ashamed : but as I have spoken unto you all things in truth , even so our boasting unto Titus was true .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you , when he remembereth the obedience of you all , and how with fear and trembling ye received him .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I may put my confidence in you in all things . Footnotes -

GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	[ g ] This say I not by commandment , but because of the [ h ] diligence of others : therefore prove I the [ i ] naturalness of your love .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	1	We [ a ] do you also to wit , brethren , of the [ b ] grace of God bestowed upon the Churches of Macedonia .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	[ j ] For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that he being rich , for your sakes became poor , that ye through his poverty might be made rich .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	That also their abundance may be for your lack , that there may be equality .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	[ p ] And thanks be unto God , which had put in the heart of Titus the same care for you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent also with him the brother , whose praise is [ q ] in the Gospel throughout all the Churches .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For to their power ( I bear record ) yea , and beyond their power they were [ d ] willing .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	And prayed us with great instance that we would receive the [ e ] grace , and fellowship of the ministering which is toward the Saints .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	[ f ] And this they did , not as we looked for : but gave their own selves , first to the Lord , and after unto us by the will of God ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	That we should exhort Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also accomplish the same grace among you also .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Therefore , as ye abound in everything , in faith and word , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love towards us , even so see that ye abound in this grace also .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	[ k ] And I show my mind herein : for this is expedient for you , which have begun not to do only , but also to [ l ] will , a year ago .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform to do it also , that as there was a readiness to will , even so ye may perform it of that which ye have .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	[ m ] For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	[ n ] Neither is it that other men should be eased and you grieved : But upon [ o ] like condition , at this time your abundance supplieth their lack :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written , ( A ) He that gathered much , had nothing over , and he that gathered little , had not the less .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	Because he accepted the exhortation , yea , he was so careful that of his own accord he went unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	( And not so only , but is also chosen of the Churches to be a fellow in our journey , concerning this [ r ] grace that is ministered by us unto the glory of the same Lord , and declaration of your prompt mind . )
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this [ s ] abundance that is ministered by us ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	( B ) Providing for honest things , not only before the Lord , but also before men .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have ofttimes proved to be diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , for the great confidence , which I have in you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Whether any do inquire of Titus , he is my fellow and helper to you-ward : or of our [ t ] brethren , they are messengers of the Churches , and the [ u ] glory of Christ .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore show toward them , and before the [ v ] Churches the proof of your love , and of the rejoicing that we have of you . Footnotes -

GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	1	For [ a ] as touching the ministering to the Saints , it is superfluous for me to write unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Now have I sent the brethren , lest our rejoicing over you should be in vain in this behalf , that ye ( as I have said ) be ready .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Lest if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we may not say , you ) should be ashamed in this my [ b ] constant boasting .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	[ d ] This yet remember , that he which soweth sparingly , shall reap also sparingly , and he that soweth liberally , shall reap also liberally .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Also he that findeth seed to the sower , will minister likewise bread for food , and multiply your seed , and increase the [ k ] fruits of your benevolence . )
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Wherefore , I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to come before unto you , and to finish your benevolence appointed afore , that it might be ready , and come as of benevolence , and not as of [ c ] niggardliness .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	As every man [ e ] wisheth in his heart , so let him give , not ( A ) [ f ] grudgingly , or of [ g ] necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all [ h ] grace to abound toward you , that ye always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound in [ i ] every good work ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	That on all parts ye may be made rich unto all liberality , which causeth through us thanksgiving unto God .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	[ l ] For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the necessities of the Saints , but also abundantly causeth many to give thanks to God ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	( Which by the [ m ] experiment of this ministration praise God for your [ n ] voluntary submission to the Gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution to them , and to all men . )
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And in their prayer for you , to long after you greatly , for the abundant grace of God in you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	9	15	[ o ] Thanks therefore be unto God for his unspeakable gift . Footnotes -

GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	( For the weapons of our warfare are not [ e ] carnal , but mighty through [ f ] God , to cast down holds . )
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And having ready the vengeance against all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	[ h ] Look ye on things after the [ i ] appearance ? If any man trust in himself that he is Christ ’ s , let him consider this again of [ j ] himself , that as he is Christ ’ s , even so are we Christ ’ s .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such one think this , that such as we are in word by letters , when we are absent , such will we be also in deed , when we are present .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	1	Now [ a ] I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness , and [ b ] gentleness of Christ , which when I am present among you am base , but am bold toward you being absent :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	[ d ] Nevertheless , though we walk in the flesh , yet we do not war after the flesh .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	Casting down the imaginations , and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God , [ g ] and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , I should have no shame .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	This I say , that I may not seem as it were to fear you with letters .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	[ l ] For we [ m ] dare not make ourselves of the number , or to compare ourselves to them , which praise themselves : but they understand not that they measure themselves with [ n ] themselves , and [ o ] compare themselves with themselves .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not rejoice of things , which are not within our [ p ] measure , ( A ) but according to the measure of the line , whereof God hath distributed unto us a measure to attain even unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we had not attained unto you : for even to you also have we come in preaching the Gospel of Christ .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting of things which are [ q ] without our measure : that is , of other men ’ s labors : and we hope , when your faith shall increase , to be magnified by you according to your line abundantly ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	And to preach the Gospel in those regions which are beyond you : not to rejoice in [ r ] another man ’ s line : that is , in the things that are prepared already .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	( B ) [ s ] But let him that rejoiceth , rejoice in the Lord .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	Verily I suppose that I was not inferior to the very chief Apostles .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you , and had need , ( B ) I was not slothful to the hindrance of any man : for that which was lacking unto me , the brethren which came from Macedonia , supplied , and in all things I kept , [ k ] and will keep myself , that I should not be grievous unto you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	[ o ] For such false apostles are deceitful workers , and transform themselves into the Apostles of Christ .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	They are Hebrews , ( C ) so am I : they are Israelites , so am I : they are the seed of Abraham , so am I .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	1	Would [ a ] to God , ye could suffer a little my foolishness , and indeed , ye suffer me .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear lest as the ( A ) serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety , so your minds should be [ d ] corrupt from the simplicity that is in [ e ] Christ :
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	[ f ] For if he that cometh , preacheth [ g ] another Jesus whom we have not preached : or if ye receive another spirit whom ye have not received : either another Gospel which ye have not received , ye might well have suffered him .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	[ h ] And though I be [ i ] rude in speaking , yet I am not so in knowledge , but among you we have been made manifest to the uttermost , in all things .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	[ j ] Have I committed an offence , because I abased myself , that ye might be exalted , and because I preached to you the Gospel of God freely ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other Churches , and took wages of them to do you service .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	The [ l ] truth of Christ is in me , that this rejoicing shall not be [ m ] shut up against me in the regions of Achaia .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , that will I do , that I may cut away occasion from them which desire occasion , that they might be found like unto us in that wherein they [ n ] rejoice .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel : for Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of [ p ] light .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing , though his ministers transform themselves , as though they were the ministers of righteousness , whose end shall be according to their works .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	[ q ] I say again , Let no man think that I am foolish , or else take me even as a fool , that I also may boast myself a little .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	That I speak , I speak it not after the Lord : but as it were foolishly , in this my great boasting .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many rejoice after [ the ] flesh , I will rejoice also .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly , because that ye are wise .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	[ r ] For ye suffer , even if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take your goods , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak as concerning the [ s ] reproach : as though that we had been [ t ] weak : but wherein any man is bold ( I speak foolishly ) I am bold also .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	They are the ministers of Christ ( I speak as a fool ) I am [ u ] more : in labors more abundant : in stripes above measure : in prison more plenteously : in [ v ] death oft .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews [ w ] five times received I forty stripes save one .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	I was [ x ] thrice ( D ) beaten with rods : I was ( E ) once stoned : I suffered thrice ( F ) shipwreck : night and day have I been in the deep sea .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	In journeying I was often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils of mine own nation , in perils among the Gentiles , in perils in the city , in perils in wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ,
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	In weariness and [ y ] painfulness , in watching often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and in nakedness .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	28	[ z ] Beside the things which are outward , I am cumbered daily , and have the care of all the Churches .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is offended , and I burn not ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	30	[ aa ] If I must needs rejoice , I will rejoice of mine infirmities .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In ( G ) Damascus the governor of the people under King Aretas , laid watch in the city of the Damascenes , and would have caught me .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	1	It [ a ] is not expedient for me no doubt to rejoice : for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know such a man ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I can not tell : God knoweth . )
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	How that he was taken up into [ d ] Paradise , and heard words which [ e ] can not be spoken , which are not [ f ] possible for man to utter .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For though I would rejoice , I should not be a fool , for I will say the truth : but I refrain , lest any man should think of me above that he seeth in me , or that he heareth of me .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take [ n ] pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in anguish for Christ ’ s sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I was a fool to boast myself : ye have compelled me : [ o ] for I ought to have been commended of you : for in nothing was I inferior unto the very chief Apostles , though I be nothing .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	20	[ u ] For I fear lest when I come , I shall not find you such as I would : and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not : and lest there be strife , envying , wrath , contentions , backbitings , whisperings , swellings , and discord .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	[ h ] And lest I should be exalted out of measure through the abundance of revelations , there was given unto me a [ i ] prick in the flesh , the messenger of [ j ] Satan to buffet me , because I should not be exalted out of measure .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	For this thing I besought the Lord [ k ] thrice , that it might depart from me .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my power is made perfect through weakness . [ l ] Very gladly therefore will I rejoice rather in mine infirmities , that the power of Christ may [ m ] dwell in me .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For what is it , wherein ye were inferiors unto other Churches , ( A ) except that I have not been [ q ] slothful to your hindrance ? forgive me this wrong .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , the third time I am ready to come unto you , and yet will I not be slothful to your hindrance : for I seek not yours , but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the fathers , but the fathers for the children .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	And I will most gladly bestow , and will be bestowed for your souls : though the more I love you , the less I am loved .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	[ r ] But be it that I charged you not : yet for as much as I was crafty , I took you with guile .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I pill you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I have desired Titus , and with him I have sent a brother : did Titus pill you of any things ? walked we not in the selfsame spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	[ s ] Again , think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you ? we speak before God in [ t ] Christ . But we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I fear lest when I come again , my God abase me among you , and I shall bewail many of them which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness , and fornication , and wantonness which they have committed . Footnotes -

GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	1	Lo this is the third time that I come unto you . ( A ) In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For though he was crucified concerning [ c ] his infirmity , yet liveth he through the power of God . And we no doubt are weak in him , but we shall live with him , through the power of God toward you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray unto God that ye do none evil , not that we should seem approved , but that ye should do that which is honest : though we be as [ f ] reprobates .

GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	3	[ a ] Seeing that ye seek experience of Christ , that speaketh in me , which toward you is not weak , but is [ b ] mighty in you .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	5	( B ) [ d ] Prove yourselves whether ye are in the faith : examine yourselves : know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	6	[ e ] But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates .
GNV	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can not do anything against the truth , but for the truth .

GNV	Galatians	1	6	[ g ] I marvel that ye are so soon [ h ] removed away unto another Gospel , from him that had called you in the grace of Christ ,

GNV	Galatians	1	8	But though that we , or an Angel from heaven preach unto you otherwise than that which we have preached unto you , let him be [ k ] accursed .
GNV	Galatians	1	10	[ l ] For now preach I [ m ] man ’ s doctrine , or God ’ s ? or go I about to please men ? for if I should yet please men , I were not the servant of Christ .

GNV	Galatians	1	12	For neither received I it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the [ o ] revelation of Jesus Christ .
GNV	Galatians	1	13	[ p ] For ye have heard of my conversation in time past , in the Jewish religion , how that ( D ) I persecuted the Church of God extremely , and wasted it ,
GNV	Galatians	1	14	And profited in the Jewish religion above many of my companions of mine own nation , and was much more zealous of the [ q ] traditions of my fathers .
GNV	Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son [ s ] in me , that I should preach him ( E ) among the Gentiles immediately , [ t ] I communicated not with [ u ] flesh and blood :
GNV	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I came again to Jerusalem , to visit Peter , and abode with him fifteen days .
GNV	Galatians	1	19	And none other of the Apostles saw I , save James the Lord ’ s brother .
GNV	Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write unto you , behold , I witness [ v ] before God , that I lie not .
GNV	Galatians	1	21	After that , I went into the coasts of Syria and Cilicia : for I was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judea which were in Christ .
GNV	Galatians	1	22	But they had heard only some say , He which persecuted us in time past , now preacheth the [ w ] faith which before he destroyed .
GNV	Galatians	1	23	And they glorified God for me . Footnotes - Galatians 1:1 A salutation comprehending in few words , the sum of the Apostle ’ s doctrine , and also besides straightway from the beginning , showing the gravity meet for the authority of an Apostle , which he had to maintain against the false apostles . - Galatians 1:1 He showeth who is the author of the minister generally : for herein the whole ministry agreeth , that whether they be Apostles , or Shepherds , or Doctors , they are appointed of God . - Galatians 1:1 He toucheth the instrumental cause : for this is a peculiar prerogative to the Apostles , to be called immediately from Christ . - Galatians 1:1 Christ no doubt is man , but he is God also , and head of the Church , and in this respect to be exempted out of the number of men . - Galatians 1:4 The sum of the true Gospel is this , that Christ by his only offering , saveth us being chosen out from the world , by the free decree of God the Father . - Galatians 1:4 Out of that [ most ] corrupt state which is without Christ . - Galatians 1:6 The first part of the Epistle wherein he witnesseth that he is an Apostle , nothing inferior to those chief disciples of Christ , and wholly agreeing with them , whose names the false apostles did abuse . And he beginneth with chiding , reproving them of lightness for that they have ear so easily unto them which perverted them and drew them away to a new Gospel . - Galatians 1:6 He useth the passive voice , to cast the fault upon the false apostles , and he useth the time that now is , to give them to understand , that it was not already done , but in doing . - Galatians 1:7 He warneth them in time to remember that there are not many Gospels , and therefore whatsoever these false apostles pretend which had the Law , Moses and the Fathers in their mouths , yet they are in deed so many corruptions of the true Gospel , insomuch that he himself , yea , and the very Angels themselves , ( and therefore much more these false apostles ) ought to be holden accursed , if they go about to change the least iota that may be in the Gospel , that he delivered to them before . - Galatians 1:7 For there is nothing more contrary to faith or free justification , than justification by the Law , or by our deserving . - Galatians 1:8 See Rom . 9:3 . - Galatians 1:10 A confirmation taken both from the nature of the doctrine itself , and also from that manner which he useth in teaching : for neither saith he , did I teach those things which pleased men as these men do which put part of salvation in external things , and works of the Law , neither went I about to procure any man ’ s favor . And therefore the matter itself showeth that that doctrine which I delivered unto you , is heavenly . - Galatians 1:10 He toucheth the false apostles who had nothing but men in their mouths , and he , though he would derogate nothing from the Apostles , preacheth God and not men . - Galatians 1:11 A second argument to prove that this doctrine is heavenly , because he had it from heaven , from Jesus Christ himself , without any man ’ s help , wherein he excelleth them whom Christ taught here on earth after the manner of men . - Galatians 1:12 This place is to be understood of an extraordinary revelation , for otherwise the Son alone revealed his Gospel by his Spirit , although by the ministry of men , which Paul shutteth out here . - Galatians 1:13 He proveth that he was extraordinarily taught of Christ himself , by the history of his former life , which the Galatians themselves know well enough : for saith he , it is well known in what school I was brought up , even from a child , to wit , amongst the deadly enemies of the Gospel . And no man may cavil and say that I was a scholar of the Pharisees in name only and not in deed , no man is ignorant , how that I excelled in Pharisaism , and was suddenly made of a Pharisee , an Apostle of the Gentiles , so that I had no space to be instructed of men . - Galatians 1:14 He calleth them the traditions of his Fathers , because he was not only a Pharisee himself , but also had a Pharisee to his father . - Galatians 1:15 He speaketh of God ’ s everlasting predestination , whereby he appointed him to be an Apostle , whereof he maketh three degrees , the everlasting counsel of God , his appointing from his mother ’ s womb , and his calling : here is no mention at all , we see , of works foreseen . - Galatians 1:16 To me , and this is a kind of speech which the Hebrews use , whereby this is given us to understand , that this gift cometh from God . - Galatians 1:16 Because it might be objected , that indeed he was called of Christ in the way , but afterwards was instructed of the Apostles and others , whose names ( as I said before ) the false apostles abused to destroy his Apostleship , as though he delivered another Gospel than the true Apostles did , and as though he were not of their number , which are to be credited without exception : therefore Paul answereth , that he began straightway after his calling to preach the Gospel at Damascus and in Arabia , and was not from that time in Jerusalem but only fifteen days , where he saw only Peter and James , and afterwards , he began to teach in Syria and Cilicia , with the consent and approbation of the Churches of the Jews , which knew him only by name , so far off was it , that he was there instructed of men . - Galatians 1:16 With any man in the world . - Galatians 1:20 This is a kind of an oath . - Galatians 1:22 The doctrine of faith .

GNV	Galatians	2	1	Then [ a ] fourteen years after , I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took with me Titus also .
GNV	Galatians	2	3	But neither yet Titus which was with me , though he were a Grecian , was compelled to be circumcised ,
GNV	Galatians	2	11	¶ And when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to his [ j ] face : for he was to be condemned .
GNV	Galatians	2	17	( B ) [ u ] If then while [ v ] we seek to be made righteous by Christ , we ourselves are found sinners , is Christ therefore the minister of sin ? God forbid .
GNV	Galatians	2	4	To wit , for the [ c ] false brethren which were craftily sent in , and crept in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage .
GNV	Galatians	2	5	To whom we gave not place by [ d ] subjection for an hour , that the [ e ] truth of the Gospel might continue with [ f ] you .
GNV	Galatians	2	6	But by them which seemed to be great , I was not taught ( whatsoever they were in time passed , I am nothing the better : ( A ) God accepteth no man ’ s person ) for they that are the chief , did add nothing to me above that I had .
GNV	Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise , when they saw that the Gospel over the [ g ] uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the Gospel over the circumcision was unto Peter :
GNV	Galatians	2	8	( For he that was mighty by Peter in the Apostleship over the circumcision , was also mighty by me toward the Gentiles . )
GNV	Galatians	2	9	And when James , and Cephas , and John , knew of the grace that was given unto me , which are [ h ] counted to be pillars , they gave to me and to Barnabas the right [ i ] hands of fellowship , that we should preach unto the Gentiles , and they unto the circumcision ,
GNV	Galatians	2	10	Warning only that we should remember the poor : which thing also I was diligent to do .
GNV	Galatians	2	12	[ k ] For before that certain came from James , he ate with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
GNV	Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews played the hypocrites likewise with him , insomuch that Barnabas was [ l ] led away with them by that their hypocrisy .
GNV	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw , that they went not the [ m ] right way to the [ n ] truth of the Gospel , I said unto Peter before all men , If thou being a Jew , livest as the Gentiles , and not like the Jews , why [ o ] constrainest thou the Gentiles to do like the Jews ?
GNV	Galatians	2	15	[ p ] We which are Jews [ q ] by nature , and not [ r ] sinners of the Gentiles ,
GNV	Galatians	2	16	Know that a man is not justified by the works of the Law , but by the faith [ s ] of Jesus Christ , even we , I say , have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the Law , because that by the works of the Law , [ t ] no flesh shall be justified .
GNV	Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things that I have destroyed , I make myself a trespasser .
GNV	Galatians	2	19	For I through the Law am dead to the [ w ] Law , that I might live unto God .
GNV	Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ , but I live , yet not [ x ] I anymore , but Christ liveth in me : and in that I now live in the [ y ] flesh , I live by the faith in the Son of God , who hath loved me , and given himself for me .
GNV	Galatians	2	21	[ z ] I do not abrogate the grace of God : for if righteousness be by the Law , then Christ died without a [ aa ] cause . Footnotes - Galatians 2:1 Now he showeth how he agreeth with the Apostles with whom he granteth that he conferred touching his Gospel which he taught among the Gentiles , fourteen years after his conversion , and they allowed it in such sort , that they constrained not his fellow Titus to be circumcised , although some tormented themselves therein , which traitorously laid wait against him , but in vain : neither did they add the least iota that might be to the doctrine which he had preached , but contrariwise they gave to him and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship and acknowledged them as Apostles appointed of the Lord to the Gentiles . - Galatians 2:2 Unfruitfully , for as touching his doctrine , Paul doubted not of it , but because there were certain reports cast abroad of him , that he was of another opinion than the rest of the Apostles were , which thing might have hindered the course of the Gospel , therefore he labored to remedy this sore . - Galatians 2:4 Which by deceit , and counterfeit holiness crept in amongst the faithful . - Galatians 2:5 By submitting ourselves to them , and betraying our own liberty . - Galatians 2:5 The true and sincere doctrine of the Gospel , which remained safe from being corrupt with any of these men ’ s false doctrines . - Galatians 2:5 Under the Galatians ’ name , he understandeth all nations . - Galatians 2:7 Among the Gentiles , as Peter had to preach it among the Jews . - Galatians 2:9 Whom alone and only , these men count for pillars of the Church , and whose name they abuse to deceive you . - Galatians 2:9 They gave us their hand in token that we agreed wholly in the doctrine of the Gospel . - Galatians 2:11 Before all men . - Galatians 2:12 Another most vehement proof of his Apostleship , and also of that doctrine , which he had delivered concerning free justification by faith only because that for this thing only he reprehended Peter at Antioch , who offended herein , in that for a few Jews ’ sakes which came from Jerusalem he played the Jew , and offended the Gentiles which had believed . - Galatians 2:13 By example rather than by judgment . - Galatians 2:14 Word for word , with a right foot which he setteth against halting and dissembling which is backward . - Galatians 2:14 He calleth the truth of the Gospel both the doctrine itself , and also the use of doctrine , which we call the practice . - Galatians 2:14 He saith they were constrained , which played the Jews by Peter ’ s example . - Galatians 2:15 The second part of this Epistle , the state whereof is this : we are justified by faith in Christ Jesus without the works of the Law : which thing he propoundeth in such sort , that first of all he meeteth with an objection , ( for I also saith he am a Jew , that no man may say against me , that I am an enemy to the Law ) and afterward , he confirmeth it by the express witness of David . - Galatians 2:15 Although we be Jews , yet we preach justification by faith because we know undoubtedly , that no man can be justified by the Law . - Galatians 2:15 So the Jews called the Gentiles , because they were strangers from God ’ s covenant . - Galatians 2:16 In Jesus Christ . - Galatians 2:16 No man , and in this word ( flesh ) there is a great vehemence , whereby is meant that the nature of man is utterly corrupt . - Galatians 2:17 Before he goeth any further , he meeteth with their objection , which abhorred this doctrine of free justification by faith , because say they , men are by this means withdrawn from the study of good works . And in this sort is the objection , If sinners should be justified through Christ by faith without the Law Christ should approve sinners , and should as it were exhort them thereunto by his ministry . Paul answereth that this consequence is false , because that Christ destroyeth sin in the believers : For so saith he do men flee unto Christ , through the terror and fear of the Law that being quit from the curse of the Law and justified , they may be saved by him , that together therewithall , he beginneth in them by little and little , that strength and power of his which destroyeth sin : to the end that this old man being abolished by the virtue of Christ crucified , Christ may live in them , and they may consecrate themselves to God . Therefore if any man give himself to sin after he hath received the Gospel , let him not accuse Christ nor the Gospel , but himself , for that he destroyeth the work of God in himself . - Galatians 2:17 He goeth from justification to sanctification , which is another benefit we receive by Christ , if we lay hold on him by faith . - Galatians 2:19 The Law that terrifieth the conscience , bringeth us to Christ , and he only causeth us to die to the Law indeed , because that by making us righteous , he taketh away from us the terror of conscience , and by sanctifying us , causeth through the mortifying of lust in us , that it can not take such occasion to sin by the restraint which the Law maketh , as it did before , Rom . 7:10-11 . - Galatians 2:20 The same that I was before . - Galatians 2:20 In this mortal body . - Galatians 2:21 The second argument taken of an absurdity : If men may be justified by the Law , then was it not necessary for Christ to die . - Galatians 2:21 For there was no cause why he should do so .

GNV	Galatians	3	1	[ a ] O foolish Galatians , who hath bewitched you , that ye should not obey the truth , to whom Jesus Christ before was described in your [ b ] sight , and among you crucified ?
GNV	Galatians	3	6	[ i ] Yea rather as [ j ] Abraham believed God , and it was ( A ) imputed to him for righteousness .
GNV	Galatians	3	10	[ q ] For as many as are of the works of the Law , are under the curse : [ r ] For it is written , ( C ) Cursed is every man that continueth not in all things , which are written in the book of the Law , to do them .
GNV	Galatians	3	21	. - Galatians 3:16 Paul speaketh not of Christ ’ s person , but of two peoples , which grew together in one , in Christ . - Galatians 3:17 The eighth argument taken of comparison , thus : If a man ’ s covenant ( being authentical ) be firm and strong , much more God ’ s covenant . Therefore the Law was not given to abrogate the promise made to Abraham , which had respect to Christ , that is to say , the end whereof did hang of Christ . - Galatians 3:17 Which tendeth to Christ . - Galatians 3:17 An enlarging of that argument , thus : Moreover and besides that the promise is of itself firm and strong , it was also confirmed with the prescription of long time , to wit , of
GNV	Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you , Received ye the [ c ] Spirit by the works of the Law , or by the hearing of [ d ] faith preached ?
GNV	Galatians	3	4	. - Galatians 3:7 The second , that the sons of Abraham must be esteemed and accounted of by faith . - Galatians 3:8 The third , that all people that believe , are without exception , comprehended in the promise of the blessing . - Galatians 3:8 A proof of the first and second grounds , out of the words of Moses . - Galatians 3:8 Blessing in this place , signifieth the free promise by faith . - Galatians 3:9 The conclusion of the fifth argument : Therefore as Abraham is blessed by faith , so are all his children ( that is to say , all the Gentiles that believe ) blessed , that is to say , freely justified . - Galatians 3:9 With faithful Abraham , and not by faithful Abraham , to give us to understand that the blessing cometh not from Abraham , but from him , by whom Abraham and all his posterity is blessed . - Galatians 3:10 The sixth argument , the conclusion whereof is also in the former verse taken of contraries , thus , They are accursed which are of the works of the Law , that is to say , which value their [ righteousness ] by the performance of the Law . Therefore they are blessed which are of faith , that is , they which have righteousness by faith . - Galatians 3:10 A proof of the former sentence or proposition : and the proposition of this argument is this : Cursed is he that fulfilleth not the whole Law . - Galatians 3:11 The second proposition with the conclusion : But no man fulfilleth the Law . Therefore no man is justified by the Law , or else , which seek righteousness by the works of the Law . And there is annexed also this manner of proof of the second proposition , to wit , Righteousness and life are attributed to faith , Therefore no man fulfilleth the Law . - Galatians 3:12 Here is a reason shown of the former consequence : Because the law promiseth life to all that keep it , and therefore if it be kept , it justifieth and giveth life . But the Scripture attributing righteousness and life to faith , taketh it from the Law , seeing that faith justifieth by imputation , and the Law by the performing of the work . - Galatians 3:13 A preventing of an objection : How then can they be blessed , whom the Law pronounceth to be accursed ? Because Christ sustained the curse which the Law laid upon us , that we might be quit from it . - Galatians 3:13 A proof of the answer by the testimony of Moses . - Galatians 3:13 Christ was accursed for us , because he bare the curse that was due to us , to make us partakers of his righteousness . - Galatians 3:14 A conclusion of all that was said before in the handling of the fifth and sixth reasons , to wit , that both the Gentiles are made partakers of the free blessing of Abraham in Christ , and also that the Jews themselves , of whose number the Apostle counteth himself to be , can not obtain that promised grace of the Gospel , which he calleth the Spirit , but only by faith . And the Apostle doth severally apply the conclusion , both to the one and the other , preparing himself a way , to the next argument , whereby he declareth , that the one only seed of Abraham , which is made of all peoples can no otherwise be joined and grow up together , but by faith in Christ . - Galatians 3:15 He putteth forth two general [ rules ] before the next argument , which is the seventh in order : That one is , that it is not lawful to break covenants and contracts which are justly made and according to Law amongst men , neither may anything be added unto them : The other is , that God did so make a covenant with Abraham , that he would gather together his children which consist both of Jews and Gentiles into one body ( as appeareth by that which hath been said before . ) For he did not say , that he would be the God of Abraham and of his seeds , ( which things notwithstanding should have been said , if he had many and divers seeds , as the Gentiles apart and the Jews apart , ) but that he would be the God of Abraham , and of his seed , as of one . - Galatians 3:15 I will use an example which is common among you , that you may be ashamed you give not so much to God ’ s covenants , as you do to man ’ s . - Galatians 3:15 Authentical , as we call it . - Galatians 3:16 He putteth forth the sum of the seventh argument , to wit , that both the Jews and the Gentiles grow together into one body of the seed of Abraham , in Christ only , so that all are one in Christ , as it is afterward declared , verse
GNV	Galatians	3	5	[ h ] He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it through the works of the Law , or by the hearing of faith preached ?
GNV	Galatians	3	7	[ k ] Know ye therefore , that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
GNV	Galatians	3	8	[ l ] For the Scripture foreseeing , that God would justify the Gentiles through faith , preached before the Gospel unto Abraham , saying , ( B ) [ m ] In thee shall all the Gentiles be [ n ] blessed .
GNV	Galatians	3	9	[ o ] So then they which be of faith , are blessed with [ p ] faithful Abraham .
GNV	Galatians	3	11	[ s ] And that no man is justified by the Law in the sight of God , it is evident : ( D ) for the just shall live by faith .
GNV	Galatians	3	12	[ t ] And the Law is not of faith : but ( E ) the man that shall do those things , shall live in them .
GNV	Galatians	3	13	[ u ] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law , made a curse for us , ( [ v ] for it is written , ( F ) [ w ] Cursed is everyone that hangeth on tree . )
GNV	Galatians	3	14	[ x ] That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus , that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
GNV	Galatians	3	15	[ y ] Brethren , I speak as [ z ] men do : ( G ) though it be but a man ’ s covenant , when it is [ aa ] confirmed , yet no man doth abrogate it , or addeth anything thereto ,
GNV	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , and to the seeds , as speaking of many : but , And to thy seed , as of one , [ ab ] which is [ ac ] Christ .
GNV	Galatians	3	17	, but proceeding of another rule : so that the argument is new , and is this : God is always like unto himself : Therefore the Law was not given to abolish the promises . But it should abolish them if it gave life , for by that means it should justify , and therefore it should abolish that justification which was promised to Abraham and to his seed by faith . Nay it was rather given to bring to light the guiltiness of all men , to the end that all believers fleeing to Christ promised , might be freely justified in him . - Galatians 3:22 By this word , Scripture , he meaneth the Law . - Galatians 3:22 All men , and whatsoever cometh from man . - Galatians 3:22 In every one of these words , there lieth an argument against the merits of works , for all these words , promise , faith , Christ , might be given , to believers , are against merits , and not one of them can stand with deserving works . - Galatians 3:23 Now there followeth another handling of the second part of this Epistle : the state whereof is this : Although the Law ( that is , the whole government of God ’ s house according to the Law ) [ does ] not justify , is it therefore to be abolished , seeing that Abraham himself was circumcised , and his posterity held still the use of Moses ’ Law ? Paul affirmeth that it ought to be abolished , because it was instituted for that end and purpose , that is should be as it were a schoolmaster and keeper to the people of God , until the promise appeared in deed , that is to say , Christ , and the Gospel manifestly published with great efficacy of the Spirit . - Galatians 3:23 The cause why we were kept under the Law , is set down here . - Galatians 3:26 Because age changeth not the condition of servants , he addeth that we are free by condition , and therefore , seeing we are out of our childhood , we have no more need of a keeper and Schoolmaster . - Galatians 3:27 Using a general particle , lest the Jews at the least should not think themselves bound with the band of the Law , he pronounceth that Baptism is common to all believers , because it is a pledge of our delivery in Christ , as well to the Jews as to the Grecians , that by this means all may be truly one in Christ , that is to say , that promised seed to Abraham and inheritors of everlasting life . - Galatians 3:27 He setteth Baptism secretly against circumcision , which the false apostles so much bragged of . - Galatians 3:27 The Church must put on Christ , as it were a garment , and be covered with him , that it may be thoroughly holy , and without blame . - Galatians 3:28 You are all as one : and so in this great knot and conjunction signified . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Galatians	3	18	[ ag ] For if the [ ah ] inheritance be of the Law , it is no more by the promise , but God gave it freely unto Abraham by promise .
GNV	Galatians	3	19	[ ai ] Wherefore then serveth the Law ? It was added because of the [ aj ] transgressions , [ ak ] till the seed came , unto the which the promise was made : [ al ] and it was [ am ] ordained by [ an ] Angels in the hand of a Mediator .
GNV	Galatians	3	20	Now a Mediator is not a Mediator of one : [ ao ] but God is one .
GNV	Galatians	3	22	But the [ aq ] Scripture hath ( H ) concluded [ ar ] all under sin , that the [ as ] promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given to them that believe .
GNV	Galatians	3	23	[ at ] But before faith came , we were kept under the Law , as under a garrison , and shut up unto [ au ] that faith , which should afterward be revealed .
GNV	Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the Law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ , that we might be made righteous by faith .
GNV	Galatians	3	25	But after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
GNV	Galatians	3	26	[ av ] For ye are all the sons of God by faith , in Christ Jesus .
GNV	Galatians	3	27	[ aw ] For all ye that are [ ax ] baptized into Christ , have [ ay ] put on Christ .
GNV	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Grecian : there is neither bond nor free : there is neither male nor female : for ye are all [ az ] one in Christ Jesus .
GNV	Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christ ’ s , then are ye Abraham ’ s seed , and heirs by promise . Footnotes - Galatians 3:1 The third reason or argument taken of those gifts of the holy Ghost , wherewith they were endued from heaven after they had heard and believed the Gospel by Paul ’ s ministry : which seeing they were so evident to all men ’ s eyes , that they were as it were lively images , wherein they might behold the truth of the doctrine of the Gospel , no less than if they had beheld with their eyes Christ himself crucified , in whose only death they ought to have their trust , he marvelleth how it could be that they could be so bewitched by the false apostles . - Galatians 3:1 Christ was laid before you , so notably and so plainly , that you had his lively image as it were represented before your eyes , as if he had been crucified before you . - Galatians 3:2 Those spiritual graces and gifts , which were a seal as it were to the Galatians , that the Gospel which was preached to them was true . - Galatians 3:2 Of the doctrine of faith . - Galatians 3:3 The fourth argument mixed with [ the former ] and it is double , If the Law is to be joined with faith , this were not to go forward , but backward , seeing that those spiritual gifts which were bestowed upon you , are more excellent than any that could proceed from yourselves . And moreover , it should follow , that the Law is better than Christ , because it should perfect and bring to end that which Christ began only . - Galatians 3:3 By the ( flesh ) he meaneth the ceremonies of the Law , against which he setteth the Spirit , that is , the spiritual working of the Gospel . - Galatians 3:4 An exhortation by manner of upbraiding , that they do not in vain suffer so many conflicts . - Galatians 3:5 He repeateth the third argument which was taken of the effects , because he had interlaced certain other arguments by the way . - Galatians 3:6 The first argument which is of great force , and hath three grounds , The first , That Abraham was justified by faith , to wit , by free imputation of righteousness according to the promise apprehended by faith , as Moses doth most plainly witness . - Galatians 3:6 See Rom .
GNV	Galatians	3	430	years , so that it could in no wise be broken . - Galatians 3:18 An objection : We grant that the promise was not abrogated by the covenant of the Law , and therefore we join the Law with the promise . Nay , saith the Apostle , these two can not stand together , to wit , that the inheritance should both be given by the Law and also by promise , for the promise is free : whereby it followeth , that the Law was not given to justify , for by that means the promise should be broken . - Galatians 3:18 By this word ( inheritance ) is meant the right of the seed , which is , that God should be our God , that is to say , that by virtue of the covenant that was made with faithful Abraham , we that be faithful , might by that means be blessed of God as well as he . - Galatians 3:19 An objection which riseth of the former answer : If the inheritance be not by the Law ( at the least in part ) then why was the Law given , after that the promise was made ? Therefore saith the Apostle , to reprove men of sin , and so teach them to look unto Christ , in whom at length that promise of saving all people together should be fulfilled , and not that the Law was given to justify men . - Galatians 3:19 That men might understand , by discovering of their sins , by the only grace of God , which he revealed to Abraham , and that in Christ . - Galatians 3:19 Until the partition wall was broken down , and that full seed sprang up , framed of two peoples , both of Jews and Gentiles : for by this word Seed , we may not understand , Christ alone by himself , but coupled and joined together with his body . - Galatians 3:19 A confirmation of the former answer taken from the manner and form of giving the Law : for it was given by Angels , striking a great terror into all , and by Moses a Mediator coming between . Now they that are one , need no Mediator , but they that are twain at the least , and that are at variance one with another . Therefore the Law itself and the Mediator , were witnesses of the wrath of God , and not that God would by this means reconcile men to himself , and abolish the promise , or add the Law unto the promise . - Galatians 3:19 Commanded and given , or proclaimed . - Galatians 3:19 By the service and ministry . - Galatians 3:20 A taking away of an objection , lest any man might say , that sometimes by consent of the parties which have made a covenant , something is added to the covenant , or the former covenants are broken . This , saith the Apostle , cometh to pass in God , who is always one , and the selfsame , and like himself . - Galatians 3:21 The conclusion uttered by a manner of asking a question , and it is the same that was uttered before , verse

GNV	Galatians	4	1	Then [ a ] I say , that the heir as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be Lord of all ,
GNV	Galatians	4	9	But now seeing ye know God , yea , rather are known of God , how turn ye again unto impotent and [ n ] beggarly rudiments , whereunto as from the beginning ye will be in bondage [ o ] again ?
GNV	Galatians	4	13	And ye know , how through [ q ] infirmity of the flesh , I preached the Gospel unto you at the first .
GNV	Galatians	4	21	[ y ] Tell me , ye that [ z ] will be under the Law , do ye not hear the Law ?
GNV	Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors , [ b ] until the time appointed of the Father .
GNV	Galatians	4	3	Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the [ c ] rudiments of the world .
GNV	Galatians	4	5	That he might redeem them which were under the Law , that we ( A ) might receive the [ g ] adoption of the sons .
GNV	Galatians	4	6	[ h ] And because ye are sons , God hath [ i ] sent forth the [ j ] Spirit of his Son into your hearts , which crieth , Abba , Father .
GNV	Galatians	4	7	Wherefore , thou art no more a [ k ] servant , but a son : now if thou be a son , thou art also the [ l ] heir of God through Christ .
GNV	Galatians	4	8	[ m ] But even then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them , which by nature are not gods :
GNV	Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days , and months , and times , and years .
GNV	Galatians	4	11	I am in fear of you , lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain .
GNV	Galatians	4	12	[ p ] Be ye as I ( for I am even as you ) brethren , I beseech you : ye have not hurt me at all .
GNV	Galatians	4	14	And the [ r ] trial of me which was in my flesh , ye despised not , neither abhorred : but ye received me as an Angel of God , yea , as [ s ] Christ Jesus .
GNV	Galatians	4	15	[ t ] What was then your felicity ? for I bear you record , that if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them unto me .
GNV	Galatians	4	16	Am I therefore become your enemy , because I tell you the truth ?
GNV	Galatians	4	17	They are jealous over you [ u ] amiss : yea , they would exclude you , [ v ] that ye should altogether love them .
GNV	Galatians	4	18	But it is a good thing to love [ w ] earnestly always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you ,
GNV	Galatians	4	19	My little children , of whom I travail in birth again , until Christ be formed in you .
GNV	Galatians	4	20	And I would I were with you now , that I might [ x ] change my voice : for I am in doubt of you .
GNV	Galatians	4	22	For it is written , that Abraham had two sons , ( B ) one by a servant , and ( C ) one by a free woman .
GNV	Galatians	4	23	But he which was of the servant , was born after the [ aa ] flesh : and he which was of the free woman , was born by [ ab ] promise .
GNV	Galatians	4	24	By the which things another thing is meant : for [ ac ] these mothers are the [ ad ] two Testaments , the one which is Hagar of mount [ ae ] Sinai , which gendereth unto bondage .
GNV	Galatians	4	25	( For Hagar or Sinai is a mountain in Arabia , and it [ af ] answered to Jerusalem which now is ) and [ ag ] she is in bondage with her children .
GNV	Galatians	4	26	But Jerusalem , which is [ ah ] above , is free : which is the mother of us all .
GNV	Galatians	4	27	[ ai ] For it is written , ( D ) Rejoice thou barren that bearest no children : break forth , and cry , thou that travailest not : for the [ aj ] desolate hath many more children , than she which hath an husband .
GNV	Galatians	4	28	( E ) Therefore , brethren , we are after the [ ak ] manner of Isaac , children of the [ al ] promise .
GNV	Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the [ am ] flesh , persecuted him that was born after the [ an ] Spirit , even so it is now .
GNV	Galatians	4	30	But what saith the Scripture ? ( F ) Put out the servant and her son : for the son of the servant shall not be heir with the son of the free woman .
GNV	Galatians	4	31	[ ao ] Then brethren , we are not children of the servant , but of the free woman . Footnotes - Galatians 4:1 He declareth that by another double similitude , which he said before concerning the keeper and schoolmaster . For he saith , that the Law , ( that is , the whole government of God ’ s house according to the Law ) was as it were a tutor or overseer appointed for a time , until such time as that protection and overseeing which was but for a time , being ended , we should at length come to be at our own liberty , and should live as children , and not as servants . Moreover , he showeth by the way , that that governance of the Law , was as it were an ABC , and as certain principles in comparison of the doctrine of the Gospel . - Galatians 4:2 This is added , because he that is always under a tutor or governor , may hardly be counted a freeman . - Galatians 4:3 The Law is called rudiments , because that by the Law God instructed his Church as it were by rudiments , and afterward poured out his holy Spirit most plentifully in the time of the Gospel . - Galatians 4:4 He uttereth and declareth many things at once , to wit , that this tutorship was ended at his time , that curious men may leave to ask , why that schoolmastership lasted so long . And moreover , that we are not sons by nature , but by adoption , and that in that Son of God , who therefore took upon him our flesh , that we might be made his brethren . - Galatians 4:4 The time is said to be full , when all parts of it are past and ended , and therefore Christ could not have come either sooner or later . - Galatians 4:4 He calleth Mary a woman , in respect of the sex , and not as the word is used in a contrary sense to a virgin still . - Galatians 4:5 The adoption of the sons of God , is from everlasting , but is revealed and showed in the time appointed for it . - Galatians 4:6 He showeth that we are in such sort free and set at liberty , that in the mean season we must be governed by the Spirit of Christ , which reigning in our hearts , may teach us the true service of the Father . But this is not to serve , but rather to enjoy true liberality , as it cometh sons and heirs . - Galatians 4:6 By that that followeth he gathereth that that went before : for if we have his spirit , we are his sons , and if we are his sons , then are we free . - Galatians 4:6 The holy Ghost , who is both of the Father and of the Son : but there is a peculiar reason why he is called the Spirit of the Son , to wit , because the holy Ghost sealeth up our adoption in Christ , and maketh us a full assurance of it . - Galatians 4:7 The word , servant , is not taken here for one that liveth in sin , which is proper to the infidels , but for one that is yet under the ceremonies of the Law , which is proper to the Jews . - Galatians 4:7 Partaker of this blessing . - Galatians 4:8 He applieth the former doctrine to the Galatians , with a peculiar reprehension : for in comparison of them , the Jews might have pretended some excuse as men that were born and brought up in that service of the Law . But seeing the Galatians were taken and called out of idolatry to Christian liberty : what pretence might they have to go back to those impotent and beggarly rudiments ? - Galatians 4:9 They are called impotent and beggarly ceremonies , being considered apart by themselves without Christ : and again , for that by that means they gave good testimony that they were beggars in Christ , when as notwithstanding , for men , to fall back from Christ to ceremonies , is nothing else , but to cast away riches , and to follow beggarly . - Galatians 4:9 By going backward . - Galatians 4:12 He mitigateth and qualifieth those things wherein he might have seemed to have spoken somewhat sharply , very artificially and divinely , declaring his good will towards them in such sort , that the Galatians could not but either be utterly desperate when they read these things , or acknowledge their own lightness with tears , and desire pardon . - Galatians 4:13 Many afflictions . - Galatians 4:14 Those daily troubles wherewith the Lord tried me amongst you . - Galatians 4:14 For my ministry ’ s sake . - Galatians 4:15 What a talk was there abroad in the world amongst men , how happy you were ? - Galatians 4:17 For they are jealous over you for their own commodity . - Galatians 4:17 That they may convey all your love from me to themselves . - Galatians 4:18 He setteth his own true and good love , which he earnestly bent towards them , against the naughty vicious love of the false apostles . - Galatians 4:20 Use other words among you . - Galatians 4:21 Because the false apostles always urged this , that unless the Gentiles were circumcised , Christ could profit them nothing at all , and this dissension of them which believed of the circumcision against them which believed of the uncircumcision , was full of offense : the Apostle , after divers arguments whereby he hath refuted their error , bringeth forth an allegory , wherein he saith the holy Ghost did shadow not unto us , all these mysteries : to wit , that it should come to pass , that two sorts of sons should have Abraham a father common to them both , but not with like success : for as Abraham begat Ishmael , by the common course of nature , of Hagar his bondmaid and a stranger , and begat Isaac of Sarah a free woman by the virtue of the promise and by grace only , and the first was not only not heir , but also persecuted the heir : So there are two covenants , and as it were two sons born to Abraham of those two covenants , as it were of two mothers . The one was made in Sinai , without the land of promise according to which covenant Abraham ’ s children according to the flesh were begotten : to wit , the Jews which seek righteousness by that covenant , that is , by the Law : but they are not heirs , nay they shall at length be cast out of the house , as they that persecute the true heirs . The other was made in that high Jerusalem or in Zion ( to wit , by the sacrifice of Christ ) which begetteth children of promise , to wit , believers by the virtue of the holy Ghost which children ( as Abraham ) do rest themselves in the free promise , and they only by the right of children shall be partakers of the father ’ s inheritance , and those servants shall be shut out . - Galatians 4:21 That desire so greatly . - Galatians 4:23 As all men are , and by the common course of nature . - Galatians 4:23 By virtue of the promise , which Abraham laid hold on for himself and his true seed , for otherwise Abraham and Sarah were past begetting and bearing children . - Galatians 4:24 These do represent and shadow forth . - Galatians 4:24 They are called two covenants , one of the old Testament , and another of the New : which were not two indeed , but in respect of the times , and the diversity of the government . - Galatians 4:24 He maketh mention of Sinai , because that covenant was made in that mountain , of which mountain Hagar was a shadow . - Galatians 4:25 Look how the case standeth betwixt Hagar and her children , even so standeth it between Jerusalem and hers . - Galatians 4:25 That is , Sinai . - Galatians 4:26 Which is excellent , and of great account . - Galatians 4:27 He showeth that in this allegory , he hath followed the steps of Isaiah , who foretold that the Church should be made and consist of the children of barren Sarah , that is to say , of them which only spiritually should be made Ahraham ’ s children by faith , rather than of fruitful Hagar , even then foreshowing the casting off of the Jews , and calling of the Gentiles . - Galatians 4:27 She that is destroyed and wasted . - Galatians 4:28 After the manner of Isaac who is the first begotten of the heavenly Jerusalem , as Israel is of the slavish Synagogue . - Galatians 4:28 That seed , unto which the promise belongeth . - Galatians 4:29 By the common course of nature . - Galatians 4:29 By the virtue of God ’ s promise and after a spiritual manner . - Galatians 4:31 The conclusion of the former allegory , that we by no means procure and call back again the slavery of the Law , seeing that the children of the bondmaid shall not be heirs .

GNV	Galatians	5	1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
GNV	Galatians	5	13	For brethren , ye have been called unto liberty : [ s ] only use not your liberty as an occasion unto the flesh , but by love serve one another .
GNV	Galatians	5	16	[ w ] Then I say , ( E ) Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh .
GNV	Galatians	5	19	[ y ] Moreover the works of the flesh are manifest , which are adultery , fornication , uncleanness , wantonness ,
GNV	Galatians	5	2	( A ) [ a ] Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be [ b ] circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
GNV	Galatians	5	3	For I testify again to every man , which is circumcised , that he is bound to keep the whole Law .
GNV	Galatians	5	4	Ye are ( B ) [ c ] abolished from Christ : whosoever are [ d ] justified by the Law , ye are fallen from grace .
GNV	Galatians	5	6	[ g ] For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything , neither [ h ] uncircumcision , [ i ] but [ j ] faith which worketh by love .
GNV	Galatians	5	7	. - Galatians 5:19 He setteth out that particularly , which he spake generally , reckoning up some chief effects of the flesh , and opposing them to the fruits of the Spirit , that no man may pretend ignorance . - Galatians 5:22 Therefore , they are not the fruits of free will , but so far forth as our will is made free by grace . - Galatians 5:23 Lest that any man should object , that Paul played the Sophister , as one who urging the Spirit , urgeth nothing but that which the Law commandeth , he showeth that he requireth not that liberal and outward obedience , but spiritual , which proceedeth not from the Law , but from the Spirit of Christ , which doth beget us again , and must and ought to be the ruler and guider of life . - Galatians 5:25 If we be indeed endued with the quickening Spirit , which causeth us to die to sin , and live to God , let us show it in our deeds , that is , by holiness of life . - Galatians 5:26 He addeth peculiar exhortations according as he knew the Galatians subject to divers vices : and first of all he warneth them to take heed of ambition , which vice hath two fellows , backbiting and envy , out of which two it can not be but many contentions must needs arise . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Galatians	5	8	[ l ] It is not the persuasion of [ m ] him that calleth you .
GNV	Galatians	5	9	( C ) [ n ] A little leaven doth leaven the whole lump .
GNV	Galatians	5	10	[ o ] I have trust in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you , shall bear his condemnation , whosoever he be .
GNV	Galatians	5	11	[ p ] And brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? Then is the slander of the cross abolished .
GNV	Galatians	5	12	[ q ] Would to God they were even cut off which do [ r ] disquiet you .
GNV	Galatians	5	14	[ t ] For [ u ] all the Law is fulfilled in one word , which is this , ( D ) Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself .
GNV	Galatians	5	15	[ v ] If ye bite and devour one another , take heed lest ye be consumed one of another .
GNV	Galatians	5	17	For the [ x ] flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary one to another , so that ye can not do the same things that ye would .
GNV	Galatians	5	18	And if ye be led by the Spirit , ye are not under the Law .
GNV	Galatians	5	20	Idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , debate , emulations , wrath , contentions , seditions , heresies ,
GNV	Galatians	5	21	Envy , murders , drunkenness , gluttony , and such like , whereof I tell you before , as I also have told you before , that they which do such things , shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
GNV	Galatians	5	22	But the [ z ] fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
GNV	Galatians	5	23	Meekness , temperancy : [ aa ] against such there is no law .
GNV	Galatians	5	24	For they that are Christ ’ s , have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts .
GNV	Galatians	5	25	If we [ ab ] live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
GNV	Galatians	5	26	[ ac ] Let us not be desirous of vainglory , provoking one another , envying one another . Footnotes - Galatians 5:2 Another obtestation wherein he plainly witnesseth that justification of works , and justification of faith can not stand together , because no man can be justified by the Law , but he that doth fully and perfectly fulfill it . And he taketh the example of circumcision , because it was the ground of all the service of the Law , and was chiefly urged of the false Apostles . - Galatians 5:2 Circumcision is in other places called the seal of righteousness , but here we must have consideration of the circumstance of the Baptism come in place of circumcision . And moreover Paul reasoneth according to the opinion that his enemies had of it , which made circumcision a piece of their salvation . - Galatians 5:4 That is , as he himself expoundeth it afterwards , ye are fallen from grace . - Galatians 5:4 That is , seek to be justified by the Law , for in deed no man is justified by the Law . - Galatians 5:5 He privily compareth the new people with the old : for it is certain that they also did ground all their hope of justification and life in faith and not in circumcision , but so , that their faith was wrapped in the external and ceremonial worship : but our faith is bare and content with spiritual worship . - Galatians 5:5 Through the Spirit , which engendereth faith . - Galatians 5:6 He addeth a reason for that now circumcision is abolished , seeing that Christ is exhibited unto us with full plenty of spiritual circumcision . - Galatians 5:6 He maketh mention also of uncircumcision , lest the Gentiles should please themselves in it , as the Jews do in circumcision . - Galatians 5:6 The taking away of an objection : If all that worship of the Law be taken away , wherein then shall we exercise ourselves ? In charity , saith Paul : for faith , whereof we speak , can not be idle , nay it bringeth forth daily fruits of charity . - Galatians 5:6 So is true faith distinguished from counterfeit faith : for charity is not joined to faith as a fellow cause , to help forward our justification with faith . - Galatians 5:7 Again he chideth the Galatians , but with an admiration , and therewithall a praise of their former race , to the end that he may make them more ashamed . - Galatians 5:8 He playeth the part of an Apostle with them , and useth his authority , denying that that doctrine can come from God which is contrary to his . - Galatians 5:8 Of God . - Galatians 5:9 He addeth this , that he may not seem to contend upon a trifle , warning them diligently ( by a similitude which he borroweth of leaven , as Christ himself also did ) not to suffer the purity of the Apostolical doctrine , to be infected with the least corruption that may be . - Galatians 5:10 He mitigateth the former reprehension , casting the fault upon the false Apostles , against whom he denounceth the horrible judgment of God . - Galatians 5:11 He willeth them to consider how that he seeketh not his own profit in this matter , seeing that he could eschew the hatred of men , if he would join Judaism with Christianity . - Galatians 5:12 An example of a true Pastor inflamed with the zeal of God ’ s glory and love of his flock . - Galatians 5:12 For they that preach the Law , cause men ’ s consciences always to tremble . - Galatians 5:13 The third part of this Epistle , showing that the right use of Christian liberty consisteth in this , that being delivered from the slavery of sin and the flesh , and being obedient to the Spirit , we should serve unto one another ’ s salvation through love . - Galatians 5:14 He propoundeth the love of our neighbor , as a mark whereunto all Christians ought to refer all their actions , and thereunto he citeth the testimony of the Law . - Galatians 5:14 This particle ( All ) must be restrained to the second table . - Galatians 5:15 An exhortation to the duties of charity , by the profit that ensueth thereof , because that no men provide worse for themselves , than they that hate one another . - Galatians 5:16 He acknowledgeth the great weakness of the godly , for that they are but in part regenerate : but he willeth them to remember that they are endued with the Spirit of God , which hath delivered them from the slavery of sin , and so of the Law so far forth as it is the virtue of sin , that they should not give themselves to lusts . - Galatians 5:17 For the flesh dwelleth even in the regenerate man , but the Spirit reigneth although not without great strife , as is largely set forth , Rom .

GNV	Galatians	6	1	Brethren , [ a ] If a man be [ b ] suddenly taken in any offense , ye which are [ c ] spiritual , [ d ] restore such one with the [ e ] spirit of meekness , [ f ] considering thyself , lest thou also be tempted .
GNV	Galatians	6	10	[ o ] While we have therefore time , let us do good unto all men , but especially unto them , which are of the household of faith .
GNV	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a [ q ] fair show in the [ r ] flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised , only because they would not suffer persecution for the [ s ] cross of Christ .
GNV	Galatians	6	13	For they themselves which are circumcised keep not the Law , but desire to have you circumcised , that they might rejoice in [ t ] your flesh .
GNV	Galatians	6	14	[ u ] But God forbid that I should [ v ] rejoice , but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , whereby the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
GNV	Galatians	6	2	[ g ] Bear ye one another ’ s burden , and so fulfill the [ h ] Law of Christ .
GNV	Galatians	6	3	For if any man seem to himself , that he is somewhat , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself in his imagination .
GNV	Galatians	6	4	But let every man prove his own work : and then shall he have rejoicing in himself only and not in another .
GNV	Galatians	6	5	( A ) [ i ] For every man shall bear his own burden .
GNV	Galatians	6	7	[ l ] Be not deceived : God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
GNV	Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth to his [ m ] flesh , shall of the flesh reap corruption : but he that soweth to the spirit , shall of the spirit reap life everlasting .
GNV	Galatians	6	9	( C ) [ n ] Let us not therefore be weary of well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
GNV	Galatians	6	11	¶ [ p ] Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
GNV	Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
GNV	Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule , peace shall be upon them , and mercy , and upon the [ w ] Israel of God .
GNV	Galatians	6	17	[ x ] From henceforth let no man put me to business : for I bear , in my body the [ y ] marks of the [ z ] Lord Jesus .
GNV	Galatians	6	18	[ aa ] Brethren , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your [ ab ] spirit , Amen . ¶ Unto the Galatians written from Rome . Footnotes - Galatians 6:1 He condemneth importunate rigor , because that brotherly reprehensions ought to be moderated and tempered by the spirit of meekness . - Galatians 6:1 Through the malice of the flesh and the devil . - Galatians 6:1 Which are upholden by the virtue of God ’ s Spirit . - Galatians 6:1 Labor to fill up that that is wanting in him . - Galatians 6:1 This is a kind of speech which the Hebrews use , giving to understand thereby , that all good gifts come from God . - Galatians 6:1 He toucheth the fore : for they commonly are most severe judges , which forget their own infirmities . - Galatians 6:2 He showeth that this is the end of reprehensions , to raise up our brother which is fallen , and not proudly to oppress him . Therefore everyone must seek to have commendation of his own life by approving of himself , and not by reprehending others . - Galatians 6:2 Christ , in plain and flat words , calleth the commandment of charity , his commandment . - Galatians 6:5 A reason wherefore men ought to have the greatest eye upon themselves , because that every man shall be judged before God according to his own life , and not by comparing himself with other men . - Galatians 6:6 It is meet that masters should be sound by their scholars , so far forth as they are able . - Galatians 6:6 Of whatsoever he hath , according to his ability . - Galatians 6:7 He commendeth liberality towards the poor , and first of all chideth them which were not ashamed to pretend this and that , and all because they would not help their neighbors , as though they could deceive God : and afterward compareth alms to a spiritual sowing , which shall have a most plentiful harvest , so that it shall be very profitable : and compareth covetous niggardliness to a carnal sowing , whereof nothing can be gathered but such things as fade away , and perish by and by . - Galatians 6:8 To the commodities of this present life . - Galatians 6:9 Against such as are liberal at the beginning , but continue not , because the harvest seemeth to be deferred very long , as though the seed time and the harvest were at one instant . - Galatians 6:10 They that are of the household of faith , that is , such as are joined with us in the profession of one selfsame religion , ought to be preferred before all others , yet so notwithstanding that our liberality extends to all . - Galatians 6:11 The fourth and last part of the Epistle , wherein he returneth to his principal end and purpose : to wit , that the Galatians should not suffer themselves to be led out of the way by the false apostles : and he pointeth out those false apostles in their colors , reproving them of ambition , as men that do not that which they do , for any affection and zeal they have to the Law , but only for this purpose , that they may purchase themselves favor amongst their own sort , by the circumcision of the Galatians . - Galatians 6:12 He setteth a far show against the truth . - Galatians 6:12 In keeping of ceremonies . - Galatians 6:12 For the preaching of him that was crucified . - Galatians 6:13 That they have entangled you in Judaism , and yet he harpeth on the form of circumcision . - Galatians 6:14 He sticketh not to compare himself with them , showing that on the contrary part he rejoiceth in those afflictions which he suffereth for Christ ’ s sake , and as he is despised of the world , so doth he in like sort esteem the world as naught : which is the true circumcision of a true Israelite . - Galatians 6:14 When Paul useth this word in good sense of part , it signifieth to rest a man ’ s self wholly in a thing , and to content himself therewith . - Galatians 6:16 Upon the true Israel , whose praise is of God and not of men , Rom . 2:19 . - Galatians 6:17 Continuing still in the same metaphor , he opposeth his miseries and the marks of those stripes which he bare for Christ ’ s sake , against the scar of the outward circumcision , as a true mark of his Apostleship . - Galatians 6:17 Marks which are burnt into a man ’ s flesh , as they used in old times , to mark their servants that had run away from them . - Galatians 6:17 For it importeth much , whose marks we bear : for the cause maketh the Martyr , and not the punishment . - Galatians 6:18 Taking his farewell of them , he wisheth them grace , and the Spirit against the deceits of the false apostles , who labored to beat those outward things into their brains . - Galatians 6:18 With your minds and hearts .

GNV	Ephesians	1	5	[ o ] Who hath predestinated us , to be adopted through Jesus Christ [ p ] in himself , according to the good pleasure of his will .
GNV	Ephesians	1	7	[ t ] By whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins , according to his rich grace :
GNV	Ephesians	1	13	[ ae ] In whom also ye have trusted , after that ye heard the [ af ] word of truth , even the Gospel of your salvation , wherein also after that ye believed , ye were [ ag ] sealed with the holy [ ah ] Spirit of promise ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	16	I cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	20	[ ap ] Which he wrought in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his [ aq ] right hand in the heavenly places ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	2	Grace be with you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	Ephesians	1	3	( B ) [ c ] Blessed be God , [ d ] and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , [ e ] which hath blessed us , with [ f ] all spiritual blessing in [ g ] heavenly things in [ h ] Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	6	[ q ] To the [ r ] praise of the glory of his grace , [ s ] wherewith he hath made us freely accepted in his beloved .
GNV	Ephesians	1	8	[ u ] [ v ] Whereby he hath been abundant toward us in [ w ] all wisdom and understanding ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	9	And hath opened unto us the [ x ] mystery of his will [ y ] according to his good pleasure , which he hath purposed in him ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	10	[ z ] That in the dispensation of the fullness of the times , he might [ aa ] gather together in one all things , both which are in heaven , and which are in earth , even in Christ :
GNV	Ephesians	1	11	[ ab ] In whom also we are chosen when we were predestinated according to the purpose of him , which worketh [ ac ] all things after the counsel of his own will ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	12	That we , which [ ad ] first trusted in Christ , should be unto the praise of his glory :
GNV	Ephesians	1	14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance , for the [ ai ] redemption of that liberty purchased unto the praise of his glory .
GNV	Ephesians	1	15	[ aj ] Therefore also after that I heard of the faith , which ye have in the Lord Jesus , and love toward all the Saints ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	17	[ ak ] That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , that Father of [ al ] glory , might give unto you the Spirit of wisdom , and revelation through the [ am ] knowledge of him ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	18	That the eyes of your understanding may be lightened , that ye may know what the [ an ] hope is of his calling , and what the riches of his glorious inheritance is in the Saints ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	19	[ ao ] And what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us , which believe , ( C ) according to the working of his mighty power ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	21	Far above all principality , and power , and might , and domination , and every [ ar ] Name , that is named , not in this world only , but also in that that is to come ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	22	[ as ] And hath made all things subject under his feet , and hath given him over all things to be the [ at ] head to the Church ,
GNV	Ephesians	1	23	Which is his body , even the [ au ] fullness of him that filleth all in all things . Footnotes - Ephesians 1:1 The inscription and salutation , whereof we have spoken in the former Epistles . - Ephesians 1:1 This is the definition of the Saints , showing what they are . - Ephesians 1:3 The first part of the Epistle , wherein he handleth all the parts of our salvation , propounding the example of the Ephesians , and using divers exhortations , and beginning after his manner with thanksgiving . - Ephesians 1:3 The efficient cause of our salvation is God , not considered confusedly and generally , but as the father of our Lord Jesus Christ . - Ephesians 1:3 The next final cause , and in respect of us , is our salvation , all things being bestowed upon us which are necessary to our salvation , which kind of blessings is heavenly and proper to the elect . - Ephesians 1:3 With all kind of gracious and bountiful goodness which is heavenly indeed , and from God only . - Ephesians 1:3 Which God our Father gave us from his high throne from above : or because the Saints have those gifts bestowed on them , which belong properly to the citizens of heaven . - Ephesians 1:3 The matter of our salvation is Christ , in whom only we are endued with spiritual blessing and unto salvation . - Ephesians 1:4 He declareth the efficient cause , or by what means God the Father saveth us in his Son : Because saith he , he chose us from everlasting in his Son . - Ephesians 1:4 To be adopted in him . - Ephesians 1:4 He expoundeth the next final cause , which he maketh double , to wit , sanctification and justification , whereof he will speak hereafter . And hereby also two things are to be noted , to wit , that holiness of life can not be separated from the grace of election : and again what pureness forever is in us , is the gift of God , who hath freely of his mercy chosen us . - Ephesians 1:4 Then God did not choose us , because we were , or otherwise should have been holy , but to the end we should be holy . - Ephesians 1:4 Being clothed with Christ ’ s righteousness . - Ephesians 1:4 Truly and sincerely . - Ephesians 1:5 Another plainer exposition of the efficient cause , and also of eternal election , whereby God is saith to have chosen us in Christ , to wit , because it pleased him to appoint us out when we were not yet born , whom he would make to be his children by Jesus Christ : so that there is no reason here of our election to be sought , but in the free mercy of God , neither is faith which God foresaw , the cause of predestination , but the effect . - Ephesians 1:5 God respecteth nothing , either that present is , or that is to come , but himself only . - Ephesians 1:6 The uttermost and chiefest final cause is the glory of God the Father , who saveth us freely in his Son . - Ephesians 1:6 That as his bountiful goodness deserveth all praise , so also it should be set forth and published . - Ephesians 1:6 Another final cause more near , is our justification , while that he freely accounteth us for just in his Son . - Ephesians 1:7 An expounding of the material cause , how we are made acceptable to God in Christ , for it is he only , whose sacrifice by the mercy of God is imputed unto us , for the forgiveness of sin . - Ephesians 1:8 Now he cometh at length to the formal cause , that is to say , to vocation or preaching of the Gospel , whereby God executeth that eternal counsel of our free reconciliation and salvation in Christ . And putting in place of the Gospel all wisdom and understanding , he showeth how excellent it is . - Ephesians 1:8 By which gracious goodness and bountifulness . - Ephesians 1:8 In perfect and sound wisdom . - Ephesians 1:9 For unless the Lord had opened unto us that mystery , we could never have so much as dreamed of it ourselves . - Ephesians 1:9 Not only the election , but also the vocation proceedeth of meer grace . - Ephesians 1:10 The Father exhibiteth and gave Christ , who is the head of all the elect unto the world , at that time which was convenient , according as he most wisely disposed all times from everlasting . And Christ is he in whom all the elect from the beginning of the world , ( otherwise wandering and separated from God ) are gathered together : of which some were then in heaven when he came into the earth , ( to wit , such as by faith in him to come , were gathered together ) and others being found upon the earth , were gathered together of him , and the rest are daily gathered together . - Ephesians 1:10 The faithful are said to be gathered together in Christ , because they are joined together with him through faith , and become as it were one man . - Ephesians 1:11 He applieth severally the benefit of vocation to the believing Jews , going back to the very fountain , that even they also may not attribute their salvation neither to themselves , nor to their stock , nor to any other thing , but to the only grace and mercy of God , both because they were called , and also because they were first called . - Ephesians 1:11 All things are attributed to the grace of God without exception , and yet for all that , we are not stocks , for he giveth us grace both to will and to be able to do those things that are good , Phil . 2:13 . - Ephesians 1:12 He speaketh of the Jews . - Ephesians 1:13 Now he maketh the Ephesians ( or rather all the Gentiles ) equal to the Jews , because that notwithstanding they came last , yet being called by the same Gospel , they embraced it by faith , and were sealed up with the same spirit , which is the pledge of election , until the inheritance itself be seen , that in them also also the glory of God might shine forth , and be manifested . - Ephesians 1:13 That word which is truth indeed , because it cometh from God . - Ephesians 1:13 This is a borrowed kind of speech taken of a seal , which being put to anything , maketh a difference between those things that are authentical , and others that are not . - Ephesians 1:13 With that Spirit , which bringeth not the Law , but the promise of free adoption . - Ephesians 1:14 Full and perfect . - Ephesians 1:15 He returneth to the former gratulation , concluding two things together of those things that went before : the first is , that all good things come to us from God the Father in Christ , and by Christ , that for them he may be praised of us . The second is that all those things ( which he bringeth to two heads , to wit , faith and charity ) are increased in us by certain degrees , so that we must desire increase of his grace from whom we have the beginning , and of whom we hope for the end . - Ephesians 1:17 The causes of faith are God the Father lightening our minds with his holy spirit , that we may embrace Christ opened unto us in the Gospel , to the obtaining of everlasting life , and the setting forth of God ’ s glory . - Ephesians 1:17 Full of majesty . - Ephesians 1:17 For it is not enough for us to have known God once , but we must know him every day more and more . - Ephesians 1:18 What blessings they are which he calleth you to hope for whom he calleth to Christ . - Ephesians 1:19 The excellency of faith is declared by the effects , because the mighty power of God is set forth and shown therein . - Ephesians 1:20 The Apostle willeth us to behold in our most glorious Christ with the eye of faith , that most excellent power and glory of God , whereof all the faithful are partakers , although it be as yet very dark in us , by reason of the ignominy of the cross and the weakness of the flesh . - Ephesians 1:20 To be set on God ’ s right hand , is to be partaker of the sovereignty which he hath over all creatures . - Ephesians 1:21 Everything whatsoever it be , or above all things be they of never such power or excellency . - Ephesians 1:22 That we should not think that that excellent glory of Christ is a thing wherewith we have nought to do , he witnesseth , that he was appointed of God the Father the head of all the Church , and therefore the body must be joined to his head , which otherwise should be a maimed thing without the members : which notwithstanding is not of necessity ( seeing that the Church is rather quickeneth and sustained by the only virtue of Christ , so far off is it , that he needeth the fullness thereof ) but of the infinite goodwill and pleasure of God , who vouchsafeth to join us to his Son . - Ephesians 1:22 Insomuch that there is nothing but is subject to him . - Ephesians 1:23 For the love of Christ is so great toward the Church , that though he do fully satisfy all with all things , yet he esteemeth himself but a maimed and unperfect head , unless he have the Church joined to him as his body .

GNV	Ephesians	2	1	And ( A ) [ a ] you hath he quickened , that were [ b ] dead in [ c ] trespasses and sins ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	5	Even when we were dead by sins , hath quickened us together in Christ , by whose grace ye are saved ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	8	For by [ p ] grace are ye saved through faith , and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	13	[ x ] But now in Christ Jesus , ye which once were far off , are made near by the blood of Christ .
GNV	Ephesians	2	16	And that he might reconcile both unto God in [ z ] one body by his cross , and [ aa ] slay hatred thereby ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	17	[ ab ] And came , and preached peace to you which were afar off , and to them that were near .
GNV	Ephesians	2	3	[ i ] Among whom we also had our conversation in time past in the lusts of our [ j ] flesh , in fulfilling the will of the flesh , and of the mind , and [ k ] were by nature the [ l ] children of wrath , as well as [ m ] others .
GNV	Ephesians	2	4	[ n ] But God which is rich in mercy , through his great love wherewith he loved us ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	6	And hath raised us up [ o ] together , and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	7	That he might show in the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace through his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus .
GNV	Ephesians	2	9	[ q ] Not of works , lest any man should boast himself .
GNV	Ephesians	2	10	For we are [ r ] his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath ordained , that we should walk in them .
GNV	Ephesians	2	11	[ s ] Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh , and [ t ] called uncircumcision of them , which are [ u ] called circumcision in the flesh , made with hands ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	12	That ye were , I say , at that time [ v ] without Christ , and were [ w ] aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and were ( B ) strangers from the covenants of promise , and had no hope , and were without God in the world .
GNV	Ephesians	2	14	[ y ] For he is our peace , which hath made of both one , and hath broken the stop of the partition wall ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	15	( C ) In abrogating through his flesh the hatred , that is , the Law of commandments which standeth in ordinances , for to make of twain one new man in himself , so making peace ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	18	For [ ac ] through him we both have an entrance unto the Father by one Spirit .
GNV	Ephesians	2	19	[ ad ] Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners : but citizens with the Saints , and of the household of God .
GNV	Ephesians	2	20	[ ae ] And are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the [ af ] chief cornerstone ,
GNV	Ephesians	2	21	In whom all the building [ ag ] coupled together , groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord .
GNV	Ephesians	2	22	In whom ye also are built together to be the habitation of God by the Spirit . Footnotes - Ephesians 2:1 He declareth again the greatness of God ’ s good will , by comparing that miserable state wherein we are born , with that dignity whereunto we are advanced by God the Father in Christ . So he describeth that condition in such sort , that he saith , that touching spiritual motions we are not only born half dead , but wholly and altogether dead . - Ephesians 2:1 See Rom . 6:2 . So then he calleth them dead , which are not regenerate : for as the immortality of them which are damned , is no life , so this knitting together of body and soul is properly no life , but death in them which are not ruled by the Spirit of God . - Ephesians 2:1 He showeth the cause of death , to wit , sins . - Ephesians 2:2 He proveth by the effects that all were spiritually dead . - Ephesians 2:2 He proveth this evil to be universal , insomuch as all are slaves of Satan . - Ephesians 2:2 At the pleasure of the prince . - Ephesians 2:2 Men are therefore slaves to Satan , because they are willingly rebellious against God . - Ephesians 2:2 They are called the children of disobedience , which are given to disobedience . - Ephesians 2:3 After that he hath severally condemned the Gentiles , he confesseth that the Jews , amongst whom he numbereth himself , are not a whit better . - Ephesians 2:3 By the name of flesh in the first place , he meaneth the whole man , which he divideth into two parts : into the flesh , which is the part that the Philosophers term without reason , and into the thought , which they call reasonable : so that he leaveth nothing in man half dead , but concludeth that the whole man is of nature the son of wrath . - Ephesians 2:3 The conclusion : All men are born subject to the wrath and curse of God . - Ephesians 2:3 Men are said to be children of wrath passively , that is to say , guilty of everlasting death by the judgment of God , who is angry with them . - Ephesians 2:3 Profane people which knew not God . - Ephesians 2:4 Now hereof followeth another member of the comparison , declaring our excellency , to wit , that by the virtue of Christ we are delivered from that death , and made partakers of eternal life , to the end that at length we may reign with him . And by divers and sundry means he beateth this into their heads , that the efficient cause of this benefit is the free mercy of God : and Christ himself is the material cause : and faith is the instrument which also is the free gift of God : and the end is God ’ s glory . - Ephesians 2:6 To wit , as he addeth afterward in Christ , for as yet this is not fulfilled in us , but only in our head , by whose spirit we have begun to die to sin , and live to God , until that work be fully brought to an end : but yet the hope is certain , for we are as sure of that we look for : as we are of that we have received already . - Ephesians 2:8 So then , Grace , that is to say , the gift of God , and faith , do stand one with another , to which two these are contrary , To be saved by ourselves , or by our works . Therefore what mean they which would join together things of so contrary nature ? - Ephesians 2:9 He taketh away expressly and namely from our works the praise of justification , seeing that the good works themselves are the effects of grace in us . - Ephesians 2:10 He speaketh here of grace , and not of nature : therefore be the works never so good , look what they are , they are it of grace . - Ephesians 2:11 Applying the former doctrine to the Gentiles , he showeth that they were not only as the Jews , by nature , but also after an especial sort , strangers and without God : and therefore they ought so much the rather remember that same so great a benefit of God . - Ephesians 2:11 You were called no otherwise than Gentiles , that all the world might witness of your uncleanness . - Ephesians 2:11 Of the Jews which were known from you by the mark of circumcision , the mark of the covenant . - Ephesians 2:12 He beginneth first with Christ , who was the end of all the promises . - Ephesians 2:12 You had no right or title , to the common wealth of Israel . - Ephesians 2:13 Christ is the only bond of the Jews and Gentiles , whereby they be reconciled to God . - Ephesians 2:14 As by the ceremonies and worship appointed by the Law , the Jews were divided from the Gentiles , so now Christ , having broken down the partition wall , joineth them both together , both in himself , and betwixt themselves , and to God . Whereby it followeth , that whosoever established the ceremonies of the Law , maketh the grace of Christ void and of none effect . - Ephesians 2:16 He alludeth to the sacrifices of the Law , which represented that true and only sacrifice . - Ephesians 2:16 For he destroyed death by death , and fastened it as it were to the cross . - Ephesians 2:17 The preaching of the Gospel is an effectual instrument of this grace , common as well to the Jews as to the Gentiles . - Ephesians 2:18 Christ is the gate as it were , by whom we come to the Father , and the holy Ghost is as it were our lodes man who leadeth us . - Ephesians 2:19 The conclusion : The Gentiles are taken into the fellowship of salvation . And he describeth the excellency of the Church , calling it the city and house of God . - Ephesians 2:20 The Lord committed the doctrine of salvation , first to the Prophets , and then to the Apostles , the end whereof and matter as it were and substance , is Christ . Therefore that is indeed the true and Catholic Church , which is builded upon Christ by the Prophets and Apostles , as a spiritual temple consecrated to God . - Ephesians 2:20 That is , the head of the building , for the foundations are as it were the heads of the buildings . - Ephesians 2:21 So that God is the workman not only of the foundation , but also of the whole building .

GNV	Ephesians	3	1	For [ a ] this cause , I Paul am the [ b ] prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles .
GNV	Ephesians	3	8	Even unto me the least of all Saints is this grace given , that I should preach among the Gentiles , the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for your sakes , which is your glory .
GNV	Ephesians	3	14	[ g ] For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	18	That ye , being rooted and grounded in [ k ] love , may be able to comprehend with all Saints , [ l ] what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height :
GNV	Ephesians	3	2	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God , which is given me to youward ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	4	Whereby when ye read , ye may know mine understanding in the mystery of Christ )
GNV	Ephesians	3	5	Which in [ c ] other ages was not opened unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy Apostles and Prophets by the Spirit ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	6	That the Gentiles should be inheritors also , and of the same body , and partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	7	Whereof I am made a minister by the gift of the grace of God given unto me through the effectual working of his power .
GNV	Ephesians	3	9	And to make clear unto all men what the fellowship of the mystery is , which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God , who hath created all things by Jesus Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	10	[ d ] To the intent , that now unto principalities and powers in heavenly places , might be known by the Church the [ e ] manifold wisdom of God ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	11	According to the [ f ] eternal purpose , which he wrought in Christ Jesus our Lord :
GNV	Ephesians	3	12	By whom we have boldness and entrance with confidence , by faith in him .
GNV	Ephesians	3	15	( Of whom is named the whole [ h ] family in heaven and in earth )
GNV	Ephesians	3	16	That he might grant you according to the [ i ] riches of his glory , that ye may be strengthened by his Spirit in the [ j ] inner man ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	17	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith :
GNV	Ephesians	3	19	And to know the [ m ] love of Christ , which [ n ] passeth knowledge , that ye may be filled with all [ o ] fullness of God .
GNV	Ephesians	3	20	[ p ] Unto him therefore that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
GNV	Ephesians	3	21	Be praise in the Church by Christ Jesus , throughout all generations forever , Amen . Footnotes - Ephesians 3:1 He maintaineth his Apostleship against the offense of the cross , whereon also he taketh an argument to confirm himself , affirming that he was not only appointed an Apostle by the mercy of God , but was also particularly appointed to the Gentiles , to call them on every side to salvation : because God had so determined it from the beginning , although he deferred a great while the manifestation of that his counsel . - Ephesians 3:1 These words , The prisoner of Jesus Christ , are taken passively , that is to say I Paul am cast into prison for maintaining the glory of Christ . - Ephesians 3:5 He meaneth not that none knew the calling of the Gentiles before , but because very few knew of it , and they that did know it , as the Prophets , had it revealed unto them very darkly , and under figures . - Ephesians 3:10 The unlooked for calling of the Gentiles , was as it were a glass to the heavenly Angels , wherin they might behold the marvellous wisdom of God . - Ephesians 3:10 God never had but one way only , to save men by : but it had divers fashions and forms . - Ephesians 3:11 Which was before all beginnings . - Ephesians 3:14 He teacheth by his own example , that the efficacy of the doctrine dependeth upon the grace of God , and therefore we ought to join prayers with the preaching and hearing of the word : which are needful not only to them which are younglings in religion , but even to the oldest also , that they growing up more and more by faith in Christ , being confirmed with all spiritual gifts , may be grounded and rooted in the knowledge of that immeasurable love , wherewith God the Father hath loved us in Christ , seeing that the whole family , whereof part is already received into heaven , and part is yet here on earth , dependeth upon that adoption of the heavenly Father , in his only Son . - Ephesians 3:15 All that whole people which hath but one household Father , and that is the Church which is adopted in Christ . - Ephesians 3:16 According to the greatness of his mercy . - Ephesians 3:16 See Rom . 7:22 . - Ephesians 3:18 Wherewith God loveth us , which is the root of our election . - Ephesians 3:18 How perfect that work of Christ is in every part . - Ephesians 3:19 Which God hath showeth us in Christ . - Ephesians 3:19 Which passeth all the capacity of man ’ s wit , to comprehend it fully in his mind : for otherwise who so hath the Spirit of God , perceiveth so much ( according to the measure that God hath given him ) as is sufficient to salvation . - Ephesians 3:19 So that we have abundantly in us , whatsoever things are required to make us perfect with God . - Ephesians 3:20 He breaketh forth into a thanksgiving , whereby the Ephesians also may be confirmed to hope for anything of God .

GNV	Ephesians	4	1	I therefore , [ a ] being prisoner in the Lord , pray you that ye walk worthy of the [ b ] vocation whereunto ye are called ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	7	[ j ] But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the [ k ] gift of Christ .
GNV	Ephesians	4	16	By whom all the body being coupled and knit together by every joint , for the furniture thereof ( according to the [ ae ] effectual power , which is in the measure of every part ) receiveth [ af ] increase of the body , unto the edifying of itself in [ ag ] love .
GNV	Ephesians	4	18	Having their understanding darkened , and being strangers from the [ aj ] life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardness of their heart :
GNV	Ephesians	4	25	[ at ] Wherefore cast off lying , and speak every man truth unto his neighbor : for we are members one of another .
GNV	Ephesians	4	29	[ az ] Let no [ ba ] corrupt communication proceed out of your mouths : but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister [ bb ] grace unto the hearers .
GNV	Ephesians	4	2	[ c ] With all humbleness of mind , and meekness , with [ d ] long suffering , supporting one another through love ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	3	[ e ] Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
GNV	Ephesians	4	5	There is one Lord , one Faith , one Baptism .
GNV	Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of all , which is [ g ] above all , and [ h ] through all , and [ i ] in you all .
GNV	Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he saith , When he ascended upon high , he led [ l ] captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
GNV	Ephesians	4	9	( Now , in that he ascended , what is it but that he had also descended first into the [ m ] lowest parts of the earth ?
GNV	Ephesians	4	10	He that descended , is even the same that ascended , far above all heavens , that he might [ n ] fill [ o ] all things . )
GNV	Ephesians	4	11	[ p ] He therefore gave some to be [ q ] Apostles , and some [ r ] Prophets , and some [ s ] Evangelists , and some [ t ] Pastors , and Teachers ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	12	[ u ] For the repairing of the Saints , for the work of the ministry , and for the edification of the [ v ] body of Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	13	[ w ] Till we all meet together ( in the [ x ] unity of faith and that acknowledging of the Son of God ) unto a perfect man , and unto the measure of the [ y ] age the fullness of Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	14	[ z ] That we henceforth be no more children , [ aa ] wavering and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the [ ab ] deceit of men , and with craftiness , whereby they lay in [ ac ] wait to deceive .
GNV	Ephesians	4	15	[ ad ] But let us follow the truth in love , and in all things , grow up into him , which is the head , that is , Christ .
GNV	Ephesians	4	17	[ ah ] This I say therefore and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as ( A ) other Gentiles walk , in [ ai ] vanity of their mind .
GNV	Ephesians	4	19	Which being [ ak ] past feeling , have given themselves unto wantonness , to work all uncleanness , even with [ al ] greediness .
GNV	Ephesians	4	20	[ am ] But ye have not so learned Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	21	If so be ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , [ an ] as the truth is in Jesus ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	22	( B ) That is , that ye cast off , concerning the conversation in time past , [ ao ] that old man , which is corrupt through the deceivable lusts ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	23	And be renewed in the [ ap ] spirit of your mind ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	24	And put on the new man , which [ aq ] after God is created unto [ ar ] righteousness , and [ as ] true holiness .
GNV	Ephesians	4	26	[ au ] Be [ av ] angry , but sin not : let not the sun go down [ aw ] upon your wrath ,
GNV	Ephesians	4	27	Neither give place to the devil .
GNV	Ephesians	4	28	[ ax ] Let him that stole , steal no more : but let him rather labor , and work with his hands the thing which is [ ay ] good , that he may have to give unto him that needeth .
GNV	Ephesians	4	30	[ bc ] And grieve not the holy Spirit of God , by whom ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
GNV	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness , and anger , and wrath , crying , and evil speaking be put away from you , with all maliciousness .
GNV	Ephesians	4	32	Be ye courteous one to another , and tender hearted , freely forgiving one another , [ bd ] even as God for Christ ’ s sake , freely forgave you . Footnotes - Ephesians 4:1 Another part of the Epistle containing precepts of Christian life , the sum whereof is this , that every man behave himself as it is meet for so excellent grace of God . - Ephesians 4:1 By this is meant the general calling of the faithful , which is this , to be holy , as our God is holy . - Ephesians 4:2 Secondly , he commendeth meekness of the mind , which is shown forth by bearing one with another . - Ephesians 4:2 See Matt . 18:25 . - Ephesians 4:3 Thirdly , he requireth perfect agreement , but yet such as is knit with the band of the holy Ghost . - Ephesians 4:4 An argument of great weight , for an earnest entertaining of brotherly love and charity one with another , because we are made one body as it were of one God , and Father , by one Spirit , worshipping one Lord with one faith , and consecrated to him with one Baptism , and hope for one selfsame glory , whereunto we are called . Therefore whosoever breaketh charity , breaketh all these things asunder . - Ephesians 4:6 Who only hath the chief authority over the Church . - Ephesians 4:6 Who only poureth forth his providence , through all the members of the Church . - Ephesians 4:6 Who only is joined together with us in Christ . - Ephesians 4:7 He teacheth us , that we indeed are all one body , and that all good gifts proceed from Christ only , who reigneth in heaven having mightily conquered all his enemies ( from whence he heapeth all gifts upon his Church : ) but yet notwithstanding these gifts are diversely and sundry ways divided according to his will and pleasure , and therefore every man ought to be content with that measure that God hath given him , and to bestow it to the common profit of the whole body . - Ephesians 4:7 Which Christ hath given . - Ephesians 4:8 A multitude of captives . - Ephesians 4:9 Down to the earth , which is the lowest part of the world . - Ephesians 4:10 Fill with his gifts . - Ephesians 4:10 The Church . - Ephesians 4:11 First of all he reckoneth up the Ecclesiastical functions , which are partly extraordinary and for a season , as Apostles , Prophets , Evangelists , and partly ordinary and perpetual , as Pastors and Doctors . - Ephesians 4:11 The Apostles were those twelve , unto whom Paul was afterward added , whose office was to plant Churches throughout all the world . - Ephesians 4:11 The Prophet ’ s office was one of the chiefest , which were men of marvellous wisdom , and some of them could foretell things to come . - Ephesians 4:11 These the Apostles used as fellows in the execution of their office , being not able to answer all places themselves . - Ephesians 4:11 Pastors are they which govern the Church , and Teachers are they which govern the Schools . - Ephesians 4:12 He showeth the end of Ecclesiastical functions , to wit , that by the ministry of men all the Saints may so grow up together , that they may make one mystical body of Christ . - Ephesians 4:12 The Church . - Ephesians 4:13 The use of this ministry is perpetual so long as we are in this world , that is , until that time that having put off the flesh , and thoroughly and perfectly agreeing betwixt ourselves , we shall be joined with Christ our head . Which thing is done by that knowledge of the Son of God increasing in us , and he himself by little and little growing up in us until we come to be a perfect man , which shall be in the world to come , when God shall be all in all . - Ephesians 4:13 In that most near conjunction which is knit and fastened together by faith . - Ephesians 4:13 Christ is said to grow up to full age , not in himself , but in us . - Ephesians 4:14 Betwixt our childhood ( that is to say , a very weak state , while as we do yet altogether waiver ) and our perfect age , which we shall have at length in another world , there is a mean , to wit , our youth , and steady going forward to perfection . - Ephesians 4:14 He compareth them which rest not themselves upon the word of God , to little boats which are tossed hither and thither with the doctrines of men , as it were with contrary winds , and therewithall forewarneth them that it cometh to pass not only by the lightness of man ’ s brain , but also by the craftiness of certain , which make as it were an art of it . - Ephesians 4:14 With those uncertain chances which toss men to and fro . - Ephesians 4:14 By the deceit of those men which are very well practised in deceiving of others . - Ephesians 4:15 By earnest affection of the truth and love , we grow up into Christ : for he ( being effectual by the ministry of his word , which as the vital spirit doth so quicken the whole body , that it nourisheth all the limbs thereof according to the measure and proportion of each one ) quickeneth and cherisheth his Church , which consisteth of divers functions , as of divers members , and preserveth the proportion of every one . And thereof it followeth that neither this body can live without Christ , neither can any man grow up spiritually , which separateth himself from the other members . - Ephesians 4:16 Of Christ , who in manner of the soul , quickeneth all the members . - Ephesians 4:16 Such increase as is meet the body should have . - Ephesians 4:16 Charity is the knitting of the limbs together . - Ephesians 4:17 He descendeth to the fruits of Christian doctrine , and reasoneth first upon the principles of manners and actions , setting down a most grave comparison between the children of God , and them which are not regenerate . For in these men , all the powers of the mind are corrupted and their mind is given to vanity , and their senses are darkened with most gross mistiness , and their affections are so accustomed by little and little to wickedness , that at length they run headlong into all uncleanness , being utterly destitute of all judgment . - Ephesians 4:17 If the noblest parts of the soul be corrupt , what is man but corruption only ? - Ephesians 4:18 Whereby God liveth in them . - Ephesians 4:19 Void of all judgment . - Ephesians 4:19 They strove to pass one another as though there had been some gain to be gotten by it . - Ephesians 4:20 Here followeth the contrary part touching men which are regenerate by the true and lively knowledge of Christ , which have other principles of their doings far different , to wit , holy and honest desires , and a mind clean changed by the virtue of the holy Ghost , from whence proceed also like effects , as a just and holy life indeed . - Ephesians 4:21 As they have learned which acknowledge Christ indeed , and in good earnest . - Ephesians 4:22 Yourselves . - Ephesians 4:23 Where there ought to have been the greatest force of reason , there is the greatest corruption of all which wasteth all things . - Ephesians 4:24 After the image of God . - Ephesians 4:24 The effect and end of the new creation . - Ephesians 4:24 Not fained nor counterfeit . - Ephesians 4:25 He commendeth severally certain peculiar Christian virtues , and first of all he requireth truth ( that is to say , sincere manners ) condemning all deceit and dissembling , because we are born one for another . - Ephesians 4:26 He teacheth us to bridle our anger in such sort , that although it be not , yet that it break not out , and that it be straightway quenched before we sleep , lest Satan taking occasion to give us evil counsel through the wicked counselor , destroy us . - Ephesians 4:26 If it so fall out , that you be angry , yet sin not : that is , bridle your anger , and do not wickedly put that in execution , which you have wickedly conceived . - Ephesians 4:26 Let not the night come upon you in your anger , that is , make atonement quickly for all matters . - Ephesians 4:28 He descendeth from the heart to the hands condemning theft : and because that men which give themselves to this wickedness use to pretend poverty , he showeth that labor is a good remedy against poverty , which God blesseth in such sort that they which labor have always some overplus to help others so far is it from this , that they are constrained to steal other men ’ s goods . - Ephesians 4:28 By laboring in things that are holy , and profitable to his neighbor . - Ephesians 4:29 He bridleth the tongue also , teaching us so to temper our talk , that our hearer ’ s mind be not only not destroyed , but also instructed . - Ephesians 4:29 Word for word , rotten . - Ephesians 4:29 By grace he meaneth that , whereby men may profit to the going on forward godliness and love . - Ephesians 4:30 A general precept against all excess of affections which dwell in the part of the mind , which they call , Angry , and he setteth against them the contrary means . And useth a most vehement preface , how we ought to take heed that we grieve not the holy Spirit of God through our immoderateness and intemperance , who dwelleth in us to this end , to moderate all our affections . - Ephesians 4:32 An argument taken from the example of Christ , most grave and vehement , both for pardoning of those injuries which have been done unto us by our greatest enemies , and much more for having consideration of the miserable , and using moderation and gentle behavior towards all men .

GNV	Ephesians	5	3	( B ) [ a ] But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as it becometh Saints ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	8	For ye were once darkness , but are now [ f ] light in the Lord : walk as children of light .
GNV	Ephesians	5	15	[ k ] Take heed therefore that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as ( D ) wise ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	22	¶ ( F ) [ r ] Wives , submit yourselves unto your husbands , [ s ] as unto the Lord .
GNV	Ephesians	5	25	¶ ( H ) [ w ] Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ loved the Church , and gave himself for it ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	1	Be ye therefore followers of God , as dear children ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	2	( A ) And walk in love , even as Christ hath loved us , and hath given himself for us , to be an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor to God .
GNV	Ephesians	5	4	Neither filthiness , neither foolish talking , neither [ b ] jesting , which are things not comely , but rather giving of thanks .
GNV	Ephesians	5	6	( C ) Let no man deceive you with vain words : for , for such things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
GNV	Ephesians	5	7	[ e ] Be not therefore companions with them .
GNV	Ephesians	5	9	( For the fruit of the [ g ] Spirit is in all goodness , and righteousness , and truth . )
GNV	Ephesians	5	10	Approving that which is pleasing to the Lord .
GNV	Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but even [ h ] reprove them rather .
GNV	Ephesians	5	12	For it is shame even to speak of the things which are done of them in secret .
GNV	Ephesians	5	13	But all things when they are reproved of the light , are manifest : for it is light that maketh all things manifest .
GNV	Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore [ i ] he saith , Awake thou that sleepest , and stand up from the [ j ] dead , and Christ shall give thee light .
GNV	Ephesians	5	16	[ l ] Redeeming the season : for the [ m ] days are evil .
GNV	Ephesians	5	17	( E ) Wherefore , be ye not unwise , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
GNV	Ephesians	5	18	[ n ] And be not drunk with wine , wherein is [ o ] excess : but be fulfilled with the Spirit ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	19	Speaking unto yourselves in Psalms , and hymns , and spiritual songs , singing and making melody to the Lord in your [ p ] hearts ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God even the Father , in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	21	[ q ] Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
GNV	Ephesians	5	23	( G ) [ t ] For the husband is the wife ’ s head , even as Christ is the head of the Church , [ u ] and the same is the Savior of his body .
GNV	Ephesians	5	24	[ v ] Therefore as the Church is in subjection to Christ , even so let the wives be to their husbands in everything .
GNV	Ephesians	5	26	[ x ] That he might [ y ] sanctify it , and cleanse it by the washing of water through the [ z ] word ,
GNV	Ephesians	5	27	That he might make it unto himself a glorious Church , [ aa ] not having spot or wrinkle , or any such thing : but that it should be holy and without blame .
GNV	Ephesians	5	28	[ ab ] So ought men to love their wives , as their own bodies : he that loveth his wife , loveth himself .
GNV	Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his [ ac ] own flesh , but nourished and cherisheth it , even as the Lord doth the Church .
GNV	Ephesians	5	30	For we are members of his body , [ ad ] of his flesh , and of his bones .
GNV	Ephesians	5	31	( I ) For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall [ ae ] cleave to his wife , and they twain shall be one flesh .
GNV	Ephesians	5	32	[ af ] This is a great secret , but I speak concerning Christ , and concerning the Church .
GNV	Ephesians	5	33	[ ag ] Therefore everyone of you , do ye so : let everyone love his wife , even as himself , and let the wife see that she fear her husband . Footnotes - Ephesians 5:3 Now he cometh to another kind of affections , which is in that part of the mind , which men call covetous or desirous : and he reprehended fornication , covetousness , and jesting , very sharply . - Ephesians 5:4 Jests which men cast one at another : that no lightness be seen , nor evil example given , nor any offense moved by evil words or backbiting . - Ephesians 5:5 Because these sins are such that the most part of men count them not for sins , he awaketh the godly , to the end they should so much the more take heed to themselves from them , as most hurtful plagues . - Ephesians 5:5 A bondslave to idolatry , for the covetous man thinketh that his life standeth in his goods . - Ephesians 5:7 Because we are not so ready to anything as to follow evil examples , therefore the Apostle warneth the godly to remember always that the others are but as it were darkness , and that they themselves are as it were light . And therefore the others commit all villany ( as men are wont in the dark ) but they ought not only not to follow their examples , but also ( as the property of the light is ) reprove their darkness , and to walk so ( having Christ that true light going before them ) as it becometh wise men . - Ephesians 5:8 The faithful are called light , both because they have the true light in them which lighteneth them , and also because they give light to others , insomuch , that their honest conversation reproveth the life of wicked men . - Ephesians 5:9 By whose force we are made light in the Lord . - Ephesians 5:11 Make them open to all the world , by your good life . - Ephesians 5:14 The Scripture , or God in the Scripture . - Ephesians 5:14 He speaketh of the death of sin . - Ephesians 5:15 The worse and more corrupt that the manners of this world are , the more watchful ought we to be against all occasions , and respect nothing but the will of God . - Ephesians 5:16 This is a metaphor taken from the merchants : who prefer the least profit that may be , before all their pleasures . - Ephesians 5:16 The times are troublesome and sharp . - Ephesians 5:18 He setteth the sober and holy assemblies of the faithful , against the dissolute bankers of the unfaithful , in which the praises of the only Lord must ring , be it in prosperity or adversity . - Ephesians 5:18 All kind of riot , joined with all manner of filthiness and shamefulness . - Ephesians 5:19 With an earnest affection of the heart , and not with the tongue only . - Ephesians 5:21 A short repetition of the end whereunto all things ought to be referred , to serve one another for God ’ s sake . - Ephesians 5:22 Now he descendeth to a family , dividing orderly all the parts of a family . And he saith that the duty of wives consisteth herein , to be obedient to their husbands . - Ephesians 5:22 The first argument , for they can not be disobedient to their husbands , but they must resist God also , who is the author of this subjection . - Ephesians 5:23 A declaration of the former saying : Because God hath made the man head of the woman in matrimony , as Christ is the head of the Church . - Ephesians 5:23 Another argument : Because the good estate of the wife dependeth of the man , so that this submission is not only just , but also very profitable : as also the salvation of the Church is of Christ , although far otherwise . - Ephesians 5:24 The conclusion of the wives ’ duty towards their husbands . - Ephesians 5:25 The husbands ’ duty towards their wives , is to love them as themselves , of which love , the love of Christ toward his Church is a lively pattern . - Ephesians 5:26 Because many men pretend the infirmities of their wives to excuse their own hardness and cruelty , the Apostle willeth us to mark what manner of Church Christ gat , when he joined it to himself , and how he doth not only not loathe all her filth and uncleanness , but ceaseth not to wipe the same away with his cleanness , until he have wholly purged it . - Ephesians 5:26 Make it holy . - Ephesians 5:26 Through the promise of free justification and sanctification in Christ , received by faith . - Ephesians 5:27 The Church , as it is considered in itself , shall not be without wrinkle , before it come to the mark it shooteth at : for while it is in this life , it runneth in a race : but if it be considered in Christ , it is clean and without wrinkle . - Ephesians 5:28 Another argument : Every man loveth himself , even of nature : therefore he striveth against nature that loveth not his wife : he proveth the consequent , first by the mystical knitting of Christ and the Church together , and then by the ordinance of God , who saith , that man and wife are as one , that is , not to be divided . - Ephesians 5:29 His own body . - Ephesians 5:30 He alludeth to the making of the woman , which signifieth our coupling together with Christ , which is wrought by faith , but is sealed by the Sacrament of the Supper . - Ephesians 5:31 See Matt . 19:5 - Ephesians 5:32 That no man might dream of natural conjunction or knitting of Christ and his Church together ( such as the husbands and the wives is ) he showeth that it is secret , to wit , spiritual and such as far differeth from the common capacity of man : as which consisteth by the virtue of the Spirit , and not of the flesh by faith , and by no natural band . - Ephesians 5:33 The conclusion both of the husband ’ s duty toward his wife , and of the wife ’ s toward her husband .

GNV	Ephesians	6	1	Children , ( A ) [ a ] obey your parents [ b ] in the [ c ] Lord : [ d ] for this is right .
GNV	Ephesians	6	5	( C ) [ j ] Servants , be obedient unto them that are your masters , [ k ] according to the flesh , with [ l ] fear and trembling in singleness of your hearts , as unto Christ ,
GNV	Ephesians	6	9	[ p ] And ye masters , do the same things unto them , putting away threatening : and know that even your master also is in heaven , neither is there ( D ) [ q ] respect of person with him .
GNV	Ephesians	6	10	¶ [ r ] Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
GNV	Ephesians	6	12	[ s ] For we wrestle not against flesh and [ t ] blood , but against ( E ) [ u ] principalities , against powers , and against the worldly governors , the princes of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness , which are in the high places .
GNV	Ephesians	6	21	¶ [ z ] But that ye may also know mine affairs , and what I do , Tychicus my dear brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall show you of all things .
GNV	Ephesians	6	2	( B ) [ e ] Honor thy father and mother ( [ f ] which is the first commandment with [ g ] promise )
GNV	Ephesians	6	3	That it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest live long on earth .
GNV	Ephesians	6	4	[ h ] And ye , fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in instruction and [ i ] information of the Lord .
GNV	Ephesians	6	7	With good will , serving the [ n ] Lord , and not men .
GNV	Ephesians	6	8	[ o ] And know ye that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , that same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free ,
GNV	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil .
GNV	Ephesians	6	13	[ v ] For this cause take unto you the whole armor of God , that ye may be able to resist in the [ w ] evil day , and having finished all things , stand fast .
GNV	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , and your loins girded about with verity , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ,
GNV	Ephesians	6	15	And your feet shod with the [ x ] preparation of the Gospel of peace .
GNV	Ephesians	6	16	Above all , take the shield of Faith , wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked ,
GNV	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of Salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
GNV	Ephesians	6	18	And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the [ y ] spirit : and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints ,
GNV	Ephesians	6	19	And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly to publish the secret of the Gospel ,
GNV	Ephesians	6	20	Whereof I am the ambassador in bonds , that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
GNV	Ephesians	6	22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know mine affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
GNV	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be with the brethren , and love with faith from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all them which love our Lord Jesus Christ , to their [ aa ] immortality , Amen . ¶ Written from Rome unto the Ephesians , and sent by Tychicus . Footnotes - Ephesians 6:1 He cometh to another part of a family , and showeth that the duty of the children toward their parents , consisteth in obedience unto them . - Ephesians 6:1 The first argument : because God hath so appointed : whereupon it followeth also , that children are so far forth bound to obey their parents , as they may not swerve from the true worship of God . - Ephesians 6:1 For the Lord is author of all fatherhood , and therefore we must yield such obedience as he will have us . - Ephesians 6:1 The second argument : because this obedience is most just . - Ephesians 6:2 A proof of the first argument . - Ephesians 6:2 The third argument , taken of the profit that ensueth thereby : because the Lord vouchsafed this commandment amongst the rest , of a special blessing . - Ephesians 6:2 With a special promise : for otherwise the second commandment hath a promise of mercy to a thousand generations , but that promise is general . - Ephesians 6:4 It is the duty of fathers to use their fatherly authority moderately , and to God ’ s glory . - Ephesians 6:4 Such information and precepts , as being taken out of God ’ s book are holy and acceptable to him . - Ephesians 6:5 Now he ascendeth to the third part of a family , to wit , to the duty both of the masters and of the servants . And he showeth that the duty of servants consisteth in a hearty love and reverence to their master . - Ephesians 6:5 He mitigateth the sharpness of service , in that they are spiritually free , notwithstanding the same , and yet that spiritual freedom taketh not away corporal service , insomuch that they can not be Christ ’ s , unless they serve their masters willingly and faithfully , so far forth as they may with safe conscience . - Ephesians 6:5 With careful reverence : for slavish fear is not allowable , much less in Christian servants . - Ephesians 6:6 To cut off occasion of all pretences , he teacheth us that it is God ’ s will that some are either born or made servants , and therefore they must respect God ’ s will , although their service be never so hard . - Ephesians 6:7 Being moved with a reverence so Godward , as though ye served God himself . - Ephesians 6:8 Although they serve unkind and cruel masters , yet the obedience of servants is no less acceptable to God , than the obedience of them that are free . - Ephesians 6:9 It is the duty of masters to use the authority that they have over their servants modestly , and holily , seeing that they in another respect have a common master , which is in heaven , who will judge both the bond and the free . - Ephesians 6:9 Either of freedom or bondage . - Ephesians 6:10 He concludeth the other part of this Epistle with a grave exhortation , that all be ready , and fight constantly , trusting to spiritual weapons , until their enemies be clean put to flight . And first of all , he warneth us to take the armor of God , whereby only our enemy may be dispatched . - Ephesians 6:12 Secondly he declareth that our chiefest and mightiest enemies are invisible , that we may not think that our chiefest conflict is with men . - Ephesians 6:12 Against men , which are of a frail and brittle nature , against which are set spiritual subtleties , more mighty than the other by a thousand parts . - Ephesians 6:12 He giveth these names to the evil angels , reason of the effects which they work : not that they are able to do the same of themselves , but because God giveth them the bridle . - Ephesians 6:13 He showeth that these enemies are put to flight with the only armor of God , to wit , with uprightness of conscience , a godly and holy life , knowledge of the Gospel , faith , and to be short , with the word of God , and using daily earnest prayer for the health of the Church , and especially , for the constance of the true , godly , and valiant ministers of the word . - Ephesians 6:13 See Eph . 5:16 . - Ephesians 6:15 That the preparation of the Gospel may be as it were shoes to you : and it is very fitly called the Gospel of peace , for that , seeing we have to go to God through most dangerous ranks of enemies , this may encourage us to go on manfully , in that we know by the doctrine of the Gospel , that we take our journey to God , who is at peace with us . - Ephesians 6:18 That holy prayers may proceed from the holy Spirit . - Ephesians 6:21 A familiar and very amiable declaration of his state , together with a solemn prayer , wherewith Paul is wont to end his Epistles . - Ephesians 6:24 To life everlasting .

GNV	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God , having you in perfect memory ,
GNV	Philippians	1	12	¶ [ k ] I would ye understood , brethren , that the things which have come unto me , are turned rather to the furthering of the Gospel ,
GNV	Philippians	1	22	[ s ] And whether to live in the [ t ] flesh were profitable for me , and what to choose I know not .
GNV	Philippians	1	27	[ u ] Only let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel of Christ , that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your matters , that ye [ v ] continue in one spirit , and in one mind , fighting together through the faith of the Gospel .
GNV	Philippians	1	28	[ w ] And in nothing fear your adversaries , which is to them a token of perdition , and to you of salvation , and that of God .
GNV	Philippians	1	2	Grace be with you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ :
GNV	Philippians	1	4	( Always in all my prayers for all you , praying with gladness )
GNV	Philippians	1	5	Because of the [ c ] fellowship which ye have in the Gospel , from the [ d ] first day unto now .
GNV	Philippians	1	6	And I am persuaded of this same thing , that he that hath begun this good work in you , will perform it until the [ e ] day of Jesus Christ ,
GNV	Philippians	1	7	As it becometh me so to judge of you all , because I have you in remembrance , that both in my [ f ] bands , and in my defense , and confirmation of the Gospel you all were partakers of my [ g ] grace .
GNV	Philippians	1	8	[ h ] For God is my record , how I long after you all from the very heart root in Jesus Christ .
GNV	Philippians	1	9	[ i ] And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge , and in all judgment ,
GNV	Philippians	1	10	That ye may allow those things which are best , that ye may be pure , and without offense , until the day of Christ ,
GNV	Philippians	1	11	Filled with the [ j ] fruits of righteousness , which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God .
GNV	Philippians	1	13	So that my bands [ l ] in Christ are famous throughout all the [ m ] judgment hall , and in all other places .
GNV	Philippians	1	14	Insomuch that many of the brethren in the Lord are boldened through my bands , and dare more frankly speak the [ n ] Word .
GNV	Philippians	1	15	Some preach Christ even through envy and strife , and some also of good will .
GNV	Philippians	1	16	The one part preacheth Christ of contention , and not [ o ] purely , supposing to add more affliction to my bands .
GNV	Philippians	1	17	But the others of love , knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel .
GNV	Philippians	1	18	[ p ] What then : yet Christ is preached all manner ways , whether it be under a [ q ] pretence , or sincerely : and I therein joy : yea , and will joy .
GNV	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and by the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
GNV	Philippians	1	20	[ r ] As I fervently look for , and hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all confidence , as always , so now Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life or by death .
GNV	Philippians	1	21	For Christ is to me both in life and in death advantage .
GNV	Philippians	1	23	For I am distressed between both , desiring to be loosed and to be with Christ , which is best of all .
GNV	Philippians	1	24	Nevertheless , to abide in the flesh , is more needful for you .
GNV	Philippians	1	25	And this am I sure of , that I shall abide , and with you all continue , for your furtherance and joy of your faith ,
GNV	Philippians	1	26	That ye may more abundantly rejoice in JESUS CHRIST for me , by my coming to you again .
GNV	Philippians	1	29	[ x ] For unto you it is given for Christ , that not only ye should believe in him , but also suffer for his sake ,
GNV	Philippians	1	30	[ y ] Having the same fight , which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me . Footnotes - Philippians 1:1 The mark whereat he shooteth in this Epistle , is to confirm the Philippians by all means possible , not only not to faint , but also to go forward . And first of all , he commendeth their former doings , to exhort them to go forward : which thing he sayeth , he hopeth fully they will do , and that by the testimony of their lively charity , but in the mean season he referreth all things to the grace of God . - Philippians 1:1 By the Bishops are meant both the Pastors , which have the dispensation of the word and the Elders , that govern : and by Deacons are meant those that were stewards of the treasury of the Church and had to look unto the poor . - Philippians 1:5 Because that you also are made partakers of the Gospel . - Philippians 1:5 Ever since I knew you . - Philippians 1:6 The Spirit of God will not forsake you unto the very latter end , until your mortal bodies shall appear before the judgment of Christ , to be glorified . - Philippians 1:7 A true proof of a true knitting together with Christ . - Philippians 1:7 He calleth his bands , grace , as though he had received some singular benefit . - Philippians 1:8 He declareth his good will towards them , therewithall showing by what means chiefly they may be confirmed , to wit , by continual prayer . - Philippians 1:9 He showeth what thing we ought chiefly desire , to wit , first of all , that we may increase in the true knowledge of God ( so that we may be able to discern things that differ one from another ) and also in charity , that even to the end we may give ourselves to good works indeed , to the glory of God by Jesus Christ . - Philippians 1:11 If righteousness be the tree , and good works the fruits , then must the papists needs be deceived , when they say that works are the cause of righteousness . - Philippians 1:12 He preventeth the offense that might come by his persecution , whereby divers took occasion to disgrace his Apostleship . To whom he answereth , that God hath blesseth his imprisonment in such wise , that he is by that means become more famous , and the dignity of the Gospel by this occasion is greatly enlarged , although not with like affection in all men , yet indeed . - Philippians 1:13 For Christ ’ s sake . - Philippians 1:13 In the Emperor ’ s court . - Philippians 1:14 The Gospel is called the Word , to set forth the excellence of it . - Philippians 1:16 Not with a pure mind : for otherwise their doctrine was pure . - Philippians 1:18 He showeth by setting forth his own example , that the end of our affliction is true joy : and that through the virtue of the Spirit of Christ , which he giveth to them that ask it . - Philippians 1:18 Under a goodly color and show : for they made Christ a cloak for their ambition and envy . - Philippians 1:20 We must continue even to the end , with great confidence , having nothing before our eyes but Christ ’ s glory only , whether we live or die . - Philippians 1:22 An example of a true shepherd , who maketh more acount how he may profit his sheep , than he doth of any commodity of his own whatsoever . - Philippians 1:22 To live in this mortal body . - Philippians 1:27 Having set down those things before , in manner of a Preface , he descendeth now to exhortations , warning them first of all , to consent both in doctrine and mind , and afterward , that being thus knit together with those common bands , they continue through the strength of faith to bear all adversity in such sort , that they admit nothing unworthy the profession of the Gospel . - Philippians 1:27 The word signifieth , to stand fast , and it is proper to wrestlers , that stand fast , and shrink not a foot . - Philippians 1:28 We ought not to be discouraged , but rather encouraged by the persecutions which the enemies of the Gospel imagine and practice against us : seeing that they are certain witnesses from God himself , both of our salvation , and of the destruction of the wicked . - Philippians 1:29 He proveth that his saying , that persecution is a token of our salvation , because it is a gift of God to suffer for Christ , which gift he bestoweth upon his own , as he doth the gift of faith . - Philippians 1:30 Now he showeth for what purpose he made mention of his afflictions .

GNV	Philippians	2	1	[ a ] If there be therefore any consolation in [ b ] Christ , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of the Spirit , if any [ c ] compassion and mercy ,
GNV	Philippians	2	3	That nothing be done through contention or vainglory , but that in meekness of mind every man esteem others better than himself .
GNV	Philippians	2	6	Who being in the [ f ] form of God , [ g ] thought it no robbery to be [ h ] equal with God :
GNV	Philippians	2	19	[ x ] And I trust in the Lord Jesus , to send ( C ) Timothy shortly unto you , that I also may be of [ y ] good comfort , when I know your state .
GNV	Philippians	2	26	For he longed after all you , and was full of heaviness , because ye had heard that he had been sick .
GNV	Philippians	2	4	Look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of other men .
GNV	Philippians	2	5	[ e ] Let the same mind be in you that was even in Christ Jesus ,
GNV	Philippians	2	7	But he made himself of [ i ] no reputation , and took on him the [ j ] form of a servant , and was made like unto men , and was found in shape as a man .
GNV	Philippians	2	8	He humbled himself , and became obedient unto the death , even the death of the cross .
GNV	Philippians	2	9	[ k ] Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him , and given him a [ l ] name above every name .
GNV	Philippians	2	10	That at the Name of Jesus should [ m ] every knee bow , both of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth .
GNV	Philippians	2	11	And that [ n ] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord , unto the glory of God the Father .
GNV	Philippians	2	12	[ o ] Wherefore my beloved , as ye have always obeyed me , not as in my presence only , but now much more in mine absence , so [ p ] make an end of your own salvation with fear and trembling .
GNV	Philippians	2	13	[ q ] For it is God which worketh in you both [ r ] the will and the deed , even of his good pleasure .
GNV	Philippians	2	14	[ s ] Do all things without ( A ) murmuring and reasonings ,
GNV	Philippians	2	15	[ t ] That ye may be blameless , and pure , and the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a naughty and crooked nation , among whom ye shine as ( B ) lights in the world ,
GNV	Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the [ u ] word of life , [ v ] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither have labored in vain .
GNV	Philippians	2	17	Yea , and though I be offered up upon the [ w ] sacrifice , and service of your faith , I am glad , and rejoice with you all .
GNV	Philippians	2	18	For the same cause also be ye glad , and rejoice with me .
GNV	Philippians	2	20	For I have no man like-minded , who will faithfully care for your matters .
GNV	Philippians	2	21	( D ) For [ z ] all seek their own , and not that which is Jesus Christ ’ s .
GNV	Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him , that as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the Gospel .
GNV	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send as soon as I know how it will go with me ,
GNV	Philippians	2	24	And I trust in the Lord , that I also myself shall come shortly .
GNV	Philippians	2	25	But I supposed it necessary to send my brother Epaphroditus unto you my companion in labor , and fellow soldier , even your messenger , and he that ministered unto me such things as I wanted .
GNV	Philippians	2	27	And no doubt he was sick , very near unto death : but God had mercy on him , and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
GNV	Philippians	2	28	I sent him therefore the more diligently , that when ye should see him again , ye might rejoice , and I might be the less sorrowful .
GNV	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness , and make much of such :
GNV	Philippians	2	30	Because that for the [ aa ] work of Christ he was near unto death , and regarded not his life , to fulfill that service which was lacking on your part toward me . Footnotes - Philippians 2:1 A most earnest request to remove all those things , whereby that great and special consent and agreement is commonly broken , to wit , contention and pride , whereby it cometh to pass , that they separate themselves one from another . - Philippians 2:1 Any Christian comfort . - Philippians 2:1 If any feeling of inward love . - Philippians 2:2 Like love . - Philippians 2:5 He setteth before them a most perfect example of all modesty and sweet conversation , Christ Jesus , whom we ought to follow with all our might : who abased himself so far for our sakes , although he be above all , that he took upon him the form of a servant , to wit , our flesh willingly , subject to all infirmities , even to the death of the cross . - Philippians 2:6 Such as God himself is , and therefore God , for there is none in all parts like to God , but God himself . - Philippians 2:6 Christ , that glorious and everlasting God , knew that he might rightfully and lawfully not appear in the base flesh of man , but remain with majesty meet for God : yet he chose rather to debase himself . - Philippians 2:6 If the Son be equal to the Father , then is there of necessity an equality , which Arrius , that Heretic , denieth : and if the Son be compared with the Father , then is there a distinction of persons , which Sabellius , that heretic , denieth . - Philippians 2:7 He brought himself from all things , as it were to nothing . - Philippians 2:7 By taking our manhood upon him . - Philippians 2:9 He showeth the most glorious event of Christ ’ s submission , to teach us , that modesty is the true way to true praise and glory . - Philippians 2:9 Dignity and renown , and the matter with it . - Philippians 2:10 All creatures shall at length be subject to Christ . - Philippians 2:11 Every nation . - Philippians 2:12 The conclusion : We must go on to salvation with humility and submission , by the way of our vocation . - Philippians 2:12 He is said to make an end of his salvation , which runneth in the race of righteousness . - Philippians 2:13 A most sure and grounded argument against pride , for that we have nothing in us praiseworthy but it cometh of the free gift of God , and is without us , for we have no ability or power , so much as to will well ( much less to do well ) but only of the free mercy of God . - Philippians 2:13 Why then , we are not stocks , but yet we do not will well of nature , but only because God hath made of our naughty will a good will . - Philippians 2:14 He describeth modesty by the contrary effects of pride , teaching us , that it is far both from all malicious , and close or inward hatred and also from open contentions and brawlings . - Philippians 2:15 To be short , he requireth a life without fault , and pure , that being lightened with the word of God , they may shine in the darkness of this world . - Philippians 2:16 The Gospel is called the word of life , because of the effects which it worketh . - Philippians 2:16 Again he pricketh them forward , setting before them his true Apostolic care that he had of them , comforting them moreover , to the end they should not be sorry for the greatness of his afflictions , no not although he should die to make perfect their oblation with his blood , as it were with a drink offering . - Philippians 2:17 As if he said , I brought you Philippians to Christ , my desire is that you present yourselves a lively sacrifice to him , and then shall it not grieve me to be offered up as a drink offering , to accomplish this your spiritual offering . - Philippians 2:19 Moreover he confirmeth their minds both by sending back Epaphroditus unto them , whose fidelity towards them , and great pains in helping him , he commendeth : and also promising to send Timothy shortly unto them , by whose presence they shall receive great commodity , and hoping also to come himself shortly unto them , if God wills . - Philippians 2:19 May be confirmed in my joy of mind . - Philippians 2:21 The most part . - Philippians 2:30 He calleth it here the work of Christ , to visit Christ , being poor and in bands in the person of Paul .

GNV	Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs : beware of evil workers : beware of the [ d ] concision .
GNV	Philippians	3	7	But the things that were [ h ] vantage unto me , the same I counted loss for Christ ’ s sake .
GNV	Philippians	3	10	[ m ] That I may [ n ] know him , and the virtue of his resurrection , and the [ o ] fellowship of his afflictions , and be made conformable unto his death ,
GNV	Philippians	3	15	[ r ] Let us therefore as many as be [ s ] perfect , be thus minded : and if ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even the same unto you .
GNV	Philippians	3	18	( C ) [ t ] For many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
GNV	Philippians	3	1	Moreover , [ a ] my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . [ b ] It grieveth me not to write the [ c ] same things to you , and for you it is a sure thing .
GNV	Philippians	3	4	[ g ] Though I might also have confidence in the flesh . If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , much more I ,
GNV	Philippians	3	5	Circumcised the eighth day , of the kindred of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , ( A ) an Hebrew of the Hebrews , ( B ) by the Law a Pharisee .
GNV	Philippians	3	6	Concerning zeal , I persecuted the Church : touching the righteousness which is in the Law , I was unrebukeable .
GNV	Philippians	3	8	Yea , doubtless I think [ i ] all things but loss for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Jesus my Lord , for whom I have counted all things loss , and do judge them to be dung , that I might [ j ] win Christ ,
GNV	Philippians	3	9	And might be found in [ k ] him , that is , [ l ] not having mine own righteousness , which is of the Law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , even the righteousness which is of God through faith ,
GNV	Philippians	3	11	If by any means I might attain unto the [ p ] resurrection of the dead :
GNV	Philippians	3	12	Not as though I had already attained to it , either were already perfect : but I follow , if that I may comprehend that for whose sake also I am [ q ] comprehended of Christ Jesus .
GNV	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , I count not myself , that I have attained to it , but one thing I do : I forget that which is behind , and endeavor myself unto that which is before ,
GNV	Philippians	3	14	And follow hard toward the mark , for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
GNV	Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless , in that whereunto we are come , let us proceed by one rule , that we may mind one thing .
GNV	Philippians	3	17	Brethren , be followers of me , and look on them , which walk so , as ye have us for an example .
GNV	Philippians	3	19	Whose [ u ] end is damnation , whose God is their belly , and whose [ v ] glory is to their shame , which mind earthly things .
GNV	Philippians	3	20	[ w ] But our conversation is in heaven , from whence also we look for the ( D ) Savior , even the Lord Jesus Christ ,
GNV	Philippians	3	21	Who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working , whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself . Footnotes - Philippians 3:1 A conclusion of those things which have been before said , to wit , that they go forward cheerfully in the Lord . - Philippians 3:1 A preface to the next admonition that followeth , to take good heed and beware of false apostles , which join Circumcision with Christ , ( that is to say , justification by works , with free justification by faith ) and beat into men ’ s heads the ceremonies which are abolished : for true exercises of godliness and charity . And he calleth them dogs as profane barkers , and evil workmen , because they neglected true works and did not teach the true use of them . To be short , he calleth them Concision , because in urging Circumcision , they cut off themselves and others from the Church . - Philippians 3:1 Which you have oftentimes heard of me . - Philippians 3:2 He alludeth to Circumcision , of the name whereof while they boasted , they cut asunder the Church . - Philippians 3:3 He showeth that we ought to use true circumcision , to wit , the circumcision of the heart , that cutting off all wicked affections by the virtue of Christ , we may serve God in purity of life . - Philippians 3:3 In outward things , which pertain nothing to the soul . - Philippians 3:4 He doubteth not to prefer himself even according to the flesh , before those perverse hote urgers of the Law , that all men may know that he doth with good judgment of mind , lightly esteem all those outward things : forsomuch as he lacketh nothing which hath Christ , nay , the confidence of our works can not stand with the free justification in Christ by faith . - Philippians 3:7 Which is accounted for vantage . - Philippians 3:8 He shutteth out all works , as well those that go before , as those that come after faith . - Philippians 3:8 That in their place I might get Christ , and of a poor man become rich : so far off am I from losing anything . - Philippians 3:9 In Christ : for they that are found without Christ , are subject to condemnation . - Philippians 3:9 That is , to be in Christ , to be found not in a man ’ s own righteousness , but clothed with the righteousness of Christ imputed to him . - Philippians 3:10 This is the end of righteousness by faith touching us , that by the virtue of his resurrection we may scape from death . - Philippians 3:10 That I may feel him indeed , and have a trial of him . - Philippians 3:10 The way to that eternal salvation is to follow Christ ’ s steps , by afflictions and persecutions , until we come to Christ himself , who is our mark whereat we shoot , and receive that reward whereunto God calleth us in him . And the Apostle setteth these true exercises of godliness against those vain ceremonies of the Law , wherein the false apostles put the sum of godliness . - Philippians 3:11 To life everlasting , which followeth the resurrection of the Saints . - Philippians 3:12 For we run not , but so far forth , as we are laid hold on of Christ , that is , as God giveth us strength , and showeth us the way . - Philippians 3:15 The conclusion of this exhortation standing upon three members : The one is , that such as have profited in the truth of this doctrine , should continue in it . The second is , that if there be any which are yet ignorant and understand not these things , and doubt of the abolishing of the Law , they should cause no trouble , and should be gently born withall , until they also be instructed of the Lord . The third is , that they esteem the false apostles by their fruits : wherein he doubteth not to set forth himself for an example . - Philippians 3:15 He said before that he was not perfect . So that in this place he calleth them perfect , which have somewhat profited in the knowledge of Christ and the Gospel , whom he setteth against the rude and ignorant , as he expoundeth himself in the next verse following . - Philippians 3:18 He painteth out the false apostles in their colors , not upon malice or ambition , but with sorrow and tears , to wit , because that being enemies of the Gospel ( for that is joined with affliction ) they regard nothing else , but the commodities of this life : that is to say , that flowing in peace , and quietness , and all worldly pleasures , they may live in great estimation amongst men , whose miserable end he forewarned them of . - Philippians 3:19 Reward . - Philippians 3:19 Which they hunt after at men ’ s hands . - Philippians 3:20 He setteth against these fellows , true pastors which neglect earthly things , and aspire to heaven only , where they know , that even in their bodies they shall be clothed with that eternal glory , by the virtue of God .

GNV	Philippians	4	1	Therefore , [ a ] my brethren , beloved and longed for , my joy and my [ b ] crown , so continue in the [ c ] Lord , ye beloved .
GNV	Philippians	4	10	[ q ] Now I rejoice also in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care for me springeth afresh , wherein notwithstanding ye were careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
GNV	Philippians	4	12	And I can be [ s ] abased , and I can abound : everywhere in all things I am [ t ] instructed , both to be full , and to be hungry , and to abound , and to have want .
GNV	Philippians	4	2	[ d ] I pray Euodia , and beseech Syntyche , that they be of one accord in the Lord .
GNV	Philippians	4	3	Yea , and I beseech thee , faithful yokefellow , help those women , which labored with me in the Gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellow laborers , whose names are in the ( A ) [ e ] book of life .
GNV	Philippians	4	5	[ h ] Let your [ i ] patient mind be known unto all men . [ j ] The Lord is at hand .
GNV	Philippians	4	6	[ k ] Be nothing careful , but in all things let your requests be showed unto God in prayer and supplication with [ l ] giving of thanks .
GNV	Philippians	4	7	And the [ m ] peace of God which passeth all understanding , shall preserve your [ n ] hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
GNV	Philippians	4	8	[ o ] Furthermore , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things [ p ] are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are worthy love , whatsoever things are of good report , if there be any virtue , or if there be any praise , think on these things .
GNV	Philippians	4	9	Which ye have both learned and received , and heard , and seen in me : those things do , and the God of peace shall be with you .
GNV	Philippians	4	11	I speak not because of [ r ] want : for I have learned in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
GNV	Philippians	4	13	I am able to do all things through the help of Christ , which strengtheneth me .
GNV	Philippians	4	14	Notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate to mine affliction .
GNV	Philippians	4	15	[ u ] And ye Philippians know also that in the [ v ] beginning of the Gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no Church communicated with me , concerning the matter of giving and receiving , but ye only .
GNV	Philippians	4	16	For even when I was in Thessalonica , ye sent once , and afterward again for my necessity .
GNV	Philippians	4	17	[ w ] Not that I desire a gift : but I desire the fruit which may further your reckoning .
GNV	Philippians	4	18	Now I have received all , and have plenty : I was even filled , after that I had received of Epaphroditus that which came from you , an [ x ] odor that smelleth sweet , a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant to God .
GNV	Philippians	4	19	And my God shall fulfill all your necessities through his riches with glory in Jesus Christ .
GNV	Philippians	4	20	Unto God even our Father be praise for evermore , Amen .
GNV	Philippians	4	21	Salute all the Saints in Christ Jesus . The brethren , which are with me , greet you .
GNV	Philippians	4	22	All the Saints salute you , and most of all they which are of [ y ] Caesar ’ s household .
GNV	Philippians	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all , Amen . ¶Written to the Philippians from Rome , and sent by Epaphroditus . Footnotes - Philippians 4:1 A rehearsal of the conclusion : That they manfully continue , until they have gotten the victory , trusting to the Lord ’ s strength . - Philippians 4:1 My honor . - Philippians 4:1 In that concord , whereof the Lord is the band . - Philippians 4:2 He also calleth on some by name , partly , because they needed private exhortation , and partly also to stir up others , to be more prompt and ready . - Philippians 4:3 God is said after the manner of men , to have a book , wherein the names of his elect are written , to whom he will give everlasting life . Ezekiel calleth it the writing of the house of Israel , and the secret of the Lord , Ezek . 13:9 . - Philippians 4:4 He addeth particular exhortations : and the first is , that the joy of the Philippians be not hindered by any afflictions that the wicked imagine and work against them . - Philippians 4:4 So is the joy of the world distinguisheth from our joy . - Philippians 4:5 The second is not taking all things in good part , they behave themselves moderately with all men . - Philippians 4:5 Your quiet and settled mind . - Philippians 4:5 The taking away of an objection : We must not be disquieted through impatience , seeing that God is at hand to give us remedy in time against all our miseries . - Philippians 4:6 The third is , that we be not too careful for anything , but with sure confidence give God thanks , and crave of him whatsoever we have need of , that with a quiet conscience we may wholly and with all our hearts submit ourselves to him . - Philippians 4:6 So David began very oft with tears , but ended with thanksgiving . - Philippians 4:7 That great quietness of mind , which God only giveth in Christ . - Philippians 4:7 He divideth the mind into the heart , that is , into that part which is the seat of the will and affections , and into the higher part , whereby we understand and reason of matters . - Philippians 4:8 A general conclusion , that as they have been taught both in word and example , so they frame their lives to the rule of all holiness and righteousness . - Philippians 4:8 Whatsoever things are such as do beautify and set you out with a holy gravity . - Philippians 4:10 He witnesseth that their liberality was acceptable to him , wherewith they did help him in his extreme poverty : but yet so moderating his words , that he might declare himself void of all suspicion of dishonesty , and that he hath a mind contented both with prosperity and adversity , and to be short , that he reposeth himself in the only will of God . - Philippians 4:11 As though I passed for my want . - Philippians 4:12 He useth a general word , and yet he speaketh but of one kind of cross , which is poverty , for commonly poverty bringeth all kinds of discommodity with it . - Philippians 4:12 This is a metaphor taken from holy things or sacrifices , for our life is like a sacrifice . - Philippians 4:15 He witnesseth that he remembereth also their former benefits , and again putteth away sinistrous suspicion of immoderate desire , in that that he received nought of any else . - Philippians 4:15 At that beginning when I preached the Gospel amongst you . - Philippians 4:17 He witnesseth again , that he alloweth well of their benefit not so much for his own sake as for theirs , because they gave it not so much to him , as they offered it to God as a sacrifice , whereof the Lord himself will not be forgetful . - Philippians 4:18 He alludeth to the sweet smelling savors that were offered in the old Law . - Philippians 4:22 Such as belong to the Emperor Nero .

And last of all in the third place even to the third Chapter , he refuteth the corruption of true doctrine . - Colossians 1:12 The efficient cause of our salvation is the only mercy of God the Father , who maketh us meet to be partakers of eternal life , delivering us from the darkness wherein we were born , and bringing us to the light of the knowledge of the glory of his Son . - Colossians 1:12 In that glorious and heavenly kingdom . - Colossians 1:14 The matter itself of our salvation , is Christ the Son of God , who hath obtained remission of sins for us by the offering up of himself . - Colossians 1:15 A lively description of the person of Christ , whereby we understand that in him only , God showeth himself to be seen : who was begotten of the Father before anything was made , that is , from everlasting , by whom also all things that are made , were made without any exception , by whom also they do consist , and whose glory they serve . - Colossians 1:15 Begotten before anything was made : and therefore the everlasting Son of the everlasting Father . - Colossians 1:16 He setteth forth the Angels with glorious names , that by the comparison of most excellent spirits we may understand how far passing the excellence of Christ , in whom only we have to content ourselves , and let go all Angels . - Colossians 1:18 Having gloriously declared the excellent dignity of the person of Christ , he describeth his office and function , to wit , that he is that same to the Church , that the head is to the body , that is to say , the prince and governor of it , and the very beginning of true life , as who rising first from death , he is the Author of eternal life , so that he is above all , in whom only there is most plentiful abundance of all good things , which is poured out upon the Church . - Colossians 1:18 Who so rose again that he shall die no more , and who raiseth others from death to life by his power . - Colossians 1:19 Most plentiful abundance of all things pertaining to God . - Colossians 1:20 Now he teacheth how Christ executed that office which his Father joined him , to wit , by suffering the death of the cross ( which was joined with the curse of God ) according to his decree , that by this sacrifice he might reconcile his Father all men as well them which believed in him to come , and were already under this hope gathered into heaven , as them which should upon the earth believe in him afterwards . And thus is justification described of the Apostle , which is one and the chiefest part of the benefit of Christ . - Colossians 1:20 The whole Church . - Colossians 1:21 Sanctification is another work of God in us by Christ , in that that he restored us ( which hated God extremely , and were wholly and willingly given to sin ) to his gracious favor , in such sort , that he therewithall purifieth us with his holy Spirit , and consecrateth us to righteousness . - Colossians 1:21 The Son . - Colossians 1:22 In that fleshly body , to give us to understand that his body was not a fantastical body , but a true body . - Colossians 1:23 This second treatise of this part of the Epistle , wherein he exhorteth the Colossians not to suffer themselves by any means to be moved from this doctrine , showing and declaring that there is nowhere any other true Gospel . - Colossians 1:23 To all men : whereby we learn that the Gospel was not shut up within the corners of Judea alone . - Colossians 1:23 He purchased authority to this doctrine by his Apostleship , and taketh a most sure proof thereof , of his afflictions which he suffereth for Christ ’ s Name to instruct the Churches with these examples of patience . - Colossians 1:24 For your profit and commodity . - Colossians 1:24 The afflictions of the Church are said to be Christ ’ s afflictions , by reason of that fellowship and knitting together , that the body and the head have the one with the other , not that there is any more need to have the Church redeemed , but that Christ showeth his power in the daily weakness of his , and that for the comfort of the whole body . - Colossians 1:25 He bringeth another proof of his Apostleship , to wit , that God is the author of it , by whom also he was appointed peculiarly Apostle of the Gentiles , to the end that by this means , that same might be fulfilled by him , which the Prophets foretold of the calling of the Gentiles . - Colossians 1:26 Whom he chose to sanctify unto himself in Christ : moreover he sayeth that the mystery of our redemption was hidden since the world began , except it were revealed unto a few , who also were taught it extraordinarily . - Colossians 1:27 This Paul bridleth the curiosity of men . - Colossians 1:28 He protesteth that he doth faithfully execute his Apostleship in every place , bringing men unto Christ only , through the Lord ’ s plentiful blessings of his labors . - Colossians 1:28 Perfect and sound wisdom , which is perfect in itself , and shall in the end make them perfect that follow it .

GNV	Colossians	1	8	[ f ] Who hath also declared unto us your love in the [ g ] Spirit .
GNV	Colossians	1	9	For this cause we also , since the day we heard of it , cease not to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be fulfilled with knowledge of [ h ] his will in all wisdom , and spiritual understanding .
GNV	Colossians	1	10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord , and please him in all things , being fruitful in all good works , and increasing in the knowledge of God ,
GNV	Colossians	1	11	[ i ] Strengthened with all might through his glorious power , unto all patience , and longsuffering with [ j ] joyfulness ,
GNV	Colossians	1	12	[ k ] Giving thanks unto the [ l ] Father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in [ m ] light ,
GNV	Colossians	1	14	[ n ] In whom we have redemption through his blood , that is , the forgiveness of sins .
GNV	Colossians	1	15	[ o ] Who is the ( B ) image of the invisible God , [ p ] the first begotten of every creature .
GNV	Colossians	1	16	( C ) For by him were all things created which are in heaven , and which are in earth , things visible and invisible : whether they be [ q ] Thrones , or Dominions , or Principalities , or Powers , all things were created by him , and for him .
GNV	Colossians	1	17	And he is before all things , and in him all things consist .
GNV	Colossians	1	18	[ r ] And he is the head of the body of the Church : he is the beginning , ( D ) and the [ s ] first begotten of the dead , that in all things he might have the preeminence .
GNV	Colossians	1	19	( E ) For it pleased the Father , that in him should [ t ] all fullness dwell .
GNV	Colossians	1	21	[ w ] And you which were in times past strangers and enemies , because your minds were set in evil works , hath [ x ] he now also reconciled ,
GNV	Colossians	1	22	In that body of his [ y ] flesh through death , to make you holy and unblameable , and without fault in his sight .
GNV	Colossians	1	23	[ z ] If ye continue , grounded and established in the faith , and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel , whereof ye have heard , and which hath been preached to [ aa ] every creature , which is under heaven , [ ab ] whereof I Paul am a minister .
GNV	Colossians	1	24	. And from thence he beginneth to apply the same to the Colossians with divers exhortations to verse
GNV	Colossians	1	25	[ ae ] Whereof I am a minister , according to the dispensation of God , which is given me unto youward , to fulfill the word of God ,
GNV	Colossians	1	26	( F ) Which is the mystery hid since the world began , and from all ages , but now is made manifest to his [ af ] Saints ,
GNV	Colossians	1	27	To whom God [ ag ] would make known what is the riches of his glorious mystery among the Gentiles , which riches is Christ in you , the hope of glory ,
GNV	Colossians	1	28	[ ah ] Whom we preach , admonishing every man , and teaching every man in [ ai ] all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus .
GNV	Colossians	1	29	Whereunto I also labor and strive , according to his working which worketh in me mightily . Footnotes - Colossians 1:1 By the free bountifulness of God . - Colossians 1:2 Colosse is situated in Phrygia , not far from Hierapolis and Laodicea , on that side that they bend toward Lycia and Pamphylia . - Colossians 1:3 He commendeth the doctrine that was delivered them by Epaphras , and their readiness in receiving it . - Colossians 1:3 We can not otherwise consider of God to our salvation , but as he is Christ ’ s Father , in whom we are adopted . - Colossians 1:5 For the glory that is hoped for . - Colossians 1:8 He declareth his good will towards them , telling them that they must not still remain at one stay but go on further both in the knowledge of the Gospel , and also in the true use of it . - Colossians 1:8 Your spiritual love , or your love which cometh from the Spirit . - Colossians 1:9 God ’ s will . - Colossians 1:11 The gift of continuance is not of us , but it proceedeth from the virtue of God , which he doth freely give us . - Colossians 1:11 It must not be unwilling , and as it were drawn out of us by force , but proceed from a merry and joyful mind . - Colossians 1:12 Having ended the preface , he goeth to the matter itself , that is to say , to an excellent description ( although it be but short ) of whole Christianity , which is fitly divided into three treatises : for first of all he expoundeth the true doctrine , according to the order of the causes , beginning from this verse to the

GNV	Colossians	2	4	[ g ] And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with [ h ] enticing words :
GNV	Colossians	2	11	[ w ] In whom also ye are circumcised with ( B ) circumcision made without hands , by putting off the [ x ] sinful body of the flesh , through the circumcision of Christ ,
GNV	Colossians	2	16	[ ak ] Let no man therefore condemn you in meat and drink , or in respect of an holy day , or of the new moon , or of the Sabbath days ,
GNV	Colossians	2	18	[ am ] Let no man at his pleasure bear rule over you by [ an ] humbleness of mind , and worshipping of Angels , [ ao ] advancing himself in those things which he never saw , [ ap ] [ aq ] rashly puffed up with his fleshly mind ,
GNV	Colossians	2	20	[ au ] Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the ordinances of the world , why , [ av ] as though ye lived in the world , are ye burdened with traditions ?
GNV	Colossians	2	1	For I [ a ] would ye knew what great fighting I have for your sakes , and for them of Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my [ b ] person in the flesh .
GNV	Colossians	2	3	In whom are hid all the treasures of [ f ] wisdom and knowledge .
GNV	Colossians	2	5	( A ) For though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and beholding your [ i ] order , and your [ j ] steadfast faith in Christ .
GNV	Colossians	2	6	As ye have therefore [ k ] received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk in him .
GNV	Colossians	2	7	Rooted and built in him , and established in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving :
GNV	Colossians	2	8	he followed another order than he doth in the confutation : because he showeth thereby what degrees false religions came into the world , to wit , beginning first by curious speculations of the wise after which in process of time succeeded gross superstition , against which mischiefs the Lord set at length that service of the Law , which some abused in like sort : but in the confutation he began with the abolishing of the Law service , that he might show by comparison , that those false services ought much more to be taken away . - Colossians 2:20 As though your felicity stood in these earthly things , and the kingdom of God were not rather spiritual . - Colossians 2:21 An imitation in the person of these superstitious men , rightly expressing their nature and use of speech . - Colossians 2:22 Another argument : The spiritual and inward kingdom of God can not consist in these outward things , and such as perish with the using . - Colossians 2:22 The third argument : Because God is not the author of these traditions , and therefore they do not bind the conscience . - Colossians 2:23 The taking away of an objection . These things have a goodly show , because men by this means , seem to worship God with a good mind and humble themselves , and neglect the body , which the most part of men curiously pamper up and cherish : but yet notwithstanding the things themselves are of no value , for so much as they pertain not to things that are spiritual and everlasting , but to the nourishment of the flesh . - Colossians 2:23 Which seem indeed to be some exquisite thing , and so wise devices as though they came from heaven . - Colossians 2:23 Hence sprang the works of supererogation , as the Papists term them , that is to say , needless works , as though men performed more than is commanded them , which was the beginning and the very ground whereon Monks ’ merits were brought in . - Colossians 2:23 A lively description of Monkery . - Colossians 2:23 Seeing they stand in meat and drink , wherein the kingdom of God doth not stand .

GNV	Colossians	2	9	[ r ] For [ s ] in him [ t ] dwelleth [ u ] all the fullness of the Godhead [ v ] bodily .
GNV	Colossians	2	10	And ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principality and power .
GNV	Colossians	2	12	[ y ] In that ye are ( C ) [ z ] buried with [ aa ] him through baptism , [ ab ] in whom ye are also raised up together through the faith of the operation of [ ac ] God , which raised him from the dead .
GNV	Colossians	2	13	( D ) [ ad ] And you which were dead in sins , [ ae ] and in the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , forgiving you all your trespasses ,
GNV	Colossians	2	14	[ af ] And putting out the ( E ) [ ag ] handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , he even took it out of the way , and fastened it upon the cross ,
GNV	Colossians	2	15	And hath spoiled the [ ah ] Principalities , and Powers , and hath [ ai ] made a show of them openly , and hath triumphed over them in the [ aj ] same cross .
GNV	Colossians	2	17	Which are but a shadow of things to come : but the [ al ] body is in Christ .
GNV	Colossians	2	19	[ ar ] And holdeth not the [ as ] head , whereof all the body furnished and knit together by joints and bands , increaseth with the increasing of [ at ] God .
GNV	Colossians	2	21	[ aw ] As , Touch not , Taste not , Handle not .
GNV	Colossians	2	22	[ ax ] Which all perish with the using , [ ay ] and are after the commandments and doctrines of men .
GNV	Colossians	2	23	[ az ] Which things have indeed a show of [ ba ] wisdom , in [ bb ] voluntary religion and humbleness of mind , and in [ bc ] not sparing the body , which are things of no value , since they pertain to the [ bd ] filling of the flesh . Footnotes - Colossians 2:1 The taking away of an objection , in that that he visited not the Colossians , nor the Laodiceans , he did it not of any negligence but is so much the more careful for them . - Colossians 2:1 Me present in body . - Colossians 2:2 He concludeth shortly the sum of the former doctrine , to wit , that the whole sum of true wisdom and most secret knowledge of God , consisteth in Christ only , and that this is the use of it touching men , that they being knit together in love , rest themselves happily in the knowledge of so great a goodness , until they come fully to enjoy it . - Colossians 2:2 Whom he never saw . - Colossians 2:2 Of that understanding , which bringeth forth certain and undoubted persuasion in our minds . - Colossians 2:3 There is no true wisdom without Christ . - Colossians 2:4 A passing over to the treatise following against the corruptions of Christianity . - Colossians 2:4 With a framed kind of talk made to persuade . - Colossians 2:5 The manner of your Ecclesiastical discipline . - Colossians 2:5 Doctrine . - Colossians 2:6 So then Christ hangeth not upon men ’ s traditions . - Colossians 2:8 He bringeth all corruptions to three kinds : The first is that , which resteth of vain and curious speculations , and yet beareth a show of a certain subtle wisdom . - Colossians 2:8 This is a word of war , and it is as much as to drive or carry away a spoil or booty . - Colossians 2:8 The second which is manifestly superstitious and vain , and standeth only upon custom and fained inspirations . - Colossians 2:8 The third kind was of them which joined the rudiments of the world , ( that is to say , the ceremonies of the Law ) with the Gospel . - Colossians 2:8 Principles and rulers , wherewith God ruled his Church , as it were under a schoolmaster . - Colossians 2:8 A general confutation of all corruptions is this , that that must needs be a false religion , which addeth anything to Christ . - Colossians 2:9 A reason : Because only Christ God and man , is most perfect , and passeth far above all things , so that whosoever hath him , may require nothing more . - Colossians 2:9 By these words , is showed a distinction of the natures . - Colossians 2:9 This word ( Dwelleth ) noteth out unto us the joining together of those natures , so that of God and Man , is one Christ . - Colossians 2:9 These words set down most perfect Godhead to be in Christ . - Colossians 2:9 The knitting together of God and man , is substantial and essential . - Colossians 2:11 Now he dealeth perfecty against the third kind , that is to say , against them which urged the Jewish religion : and first of all , he denieth that we have need of the Circumcision of the flesh , seeing that without it we are circumcised within , by the virtue of Christ . - Colossians 2:11 These many words are used to show what the old man is , whom Paul in other places calleth the body of sin . - Colossians 2:12 The taking away of an objection : we need not so much as the eternal sign which our fathers had , seeing that our baptism is a most effectual pledge and witness , of that inward restoring and renewing . - Colossians 2:12 See Rom . 6:4 . - Colossians 2:12 So then all the force of the matter cometh not from the very deed done , that is to say , it is not the dipping of us into the water by a Minister that maketh us to be buried with Christ , as the Papists say , that even for the very act ’ s sake , we become verily Christians , but it cometh from the virtue of Christ , for the Apostle addeth the resurrection of Christ and faith . - Colossians 2:12 One end of Baptism is the death and burial of the old man , and that by the mighty power of God only , whose virtue we lay hold on by faith , in the death and resurrection of Christ . - Colossians 2:12 Through faith which cometh from God . - Colossians 2:13 Another end of Baptism is , that we which were dead in sin , might obtain free remission of sins and eternal life through faith in Christ who died for us . - Colossians 2:13 A new argument which lieth in these few words , and it is thus : Uncircumcision was no hindrance to you , why you being justified in Christ should not obtain life therefore you need not circumcision to the argument of salvation . - Colossians 2:14 He speaketh now more generally against the whole service of the Law , and showeth by two reasons that it is abolished : First , to what purpose should he that hath obtained remission of all his sins in Christ require those helps of the Law ? Secondly , because that if a man do rightly consider those rites , he shall find that they were so many testimonies of our guiltiness , whereby we manifestly witnessed as it were by our own handwriting that we deserved damnation . Therefore did Christ put out that handwriting by his coming and fastening it to the cross , triumphed over all our enemies , were they never so mighty . Therefore to what end and purpose should we now use those ceremonies , as though we were still guilty of sin , and subject to the tyranny of our enemies ? - Colossians 2:14 Abolishing the rites and ceremonies . - Colossians 2:15 Satan and his angels . - Colossians 2:15 As a conqueror made by a show of those captives , and put them to shame . - Colossians 2:15 The cross was as a chariot of triumph . No conqueror could have triumphed so gloriously in his chariot , as Christ did upon the cross . - Colossians 2:16 The conclusion : wherein also he nameth certain kinds , as the difference of days and meats , and proveth by a new argument that we are not bond unto them : to wit , because those things were shadows of Christ to come but we possess him now exhibited unto us . - Colossians 2:17 The body as a thing of substance and pith , he setteth against shadows . - Colossians 2:18 He disputeth against the first kind of corruptions , and setteth down the worshipping of Angels for an example : which kind of false religion he confuteth , first this way : because that they which being in such a worship , attribute that unto themselves which is proper only to God , to wit , authority to bind men ’ s consciences with religion , although they seem to bring in these things by humbleness of mind . - Colossians 2:18 By a foolish humbleness of mind : for otherwise humbleness is a virtue . For these Angel worshippers blamed such of pride , as would go straight to God , and use no other under means besides Christ . - Colossians 2:18 Secondly , because they rashly thrust upon them for oracles , those things which they neither saw nor heard , but devised of themselves . - Colossians 2:18 Thirdly , because these things have no other ground , whereupon they are built , but only the opinion of men , which please themselves without all measure in their own duties . - Colossians 2:18 Without reason . - Colossians 2:19 The fourth argument , which is of great weight , because they spoil Christ of his dignity , who only is sufficient both to nourish , and also to increase his whole body . - Colossians 2:19 Christ . - Colossians 2:19 With the increasing which cometh from God . - Colossians 2:20 Now last of all he fighteth against the second kind of corruptions , that is to say , against mere superstitions , invented of men , which partly deceive the simplicity of some with their craftiness , and partly with very foolish superstitions , and to be laughed at : as when godliness , remission of sins , or any such like virtue is put in some certain kind of meat and such like things , which the inventors of such rites themselves understand not , because indeed it is not . And he useth an argument taken of comparison . If by the death of Christ who establisheth a new covenant with his blood , you be delivered from those external rites wherewith it pleased the Lord to prepare the world , as it were by certain rudiments to that full knowledge of true religion , why would ye be burdened with traditions , I wrote not what , as though ye were citizens of this world , that is to say , as though ye depended upon this life , and earthly things ? Now this is the cause why before verse

GNV	Colossians	3	1	If [ a ] ye then [ b ] be [ c ] risen with Christ , [ d ] seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God .
GNV	Colossians	3	2	Set your affections on things which are above , and not on things which are on the [ e ] earth .
GNV	Colossians	3	5	( A ) [ h ] Mortify therefore your [ i ] members which are on the earth , fornication , uncleanness , the inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness which is idolatry .
GNV	Colossians	3	8	But now put ye away even all these things , wrath , anger , maliciousness , cursed speaking , filthy speaking , out of your mouth .
GNV	Colossians	3	18	¶ ( C ) [ v ] Wives , submit yourselves unto your husbands , as it is [ w ] comely in the Lord .
GNV	Colossians	3	4	When Christ which is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
GNV	Colossians	3	6	For the which things ’ sake the wrath of God [ j ] cometh on the children of disobedience .
GNV	Colossians	3	7	Wherein ye also walked once , when ye lived in them .
GNV	Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another : [ k ] seeing that ye have put off the old man with his works ,
GNV	Colossians	3	10	And have put on the new , [ l ] which is renewed in [ m ] knowledge after the image of him that created him ,
GNV	Colossians	3	11	[ n ] Where is neither Grecian nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond , free : But Christ is all , and in all things .
GNV	Colossians	3	12	Now therefore as the elect of God , holy and beloved , [ o ] put on the [ p ] bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering :
GNV	Colossians	3	13	Forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel to another : even as Christ forgave , even so do ye .
GNV	Colossians	3	14	And above all these things put on love , which is the [ q ] bond of perfectness .
GNV	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of God [ r ] rule in your hearts , to the which ye are called in [ s ] one body , and be ye thankful :

GNV	Colossians	3	19	( D ) [ x ] Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter unto them .
GNV	Colossians	3	20	¶ ( E ) [ y ] Children , obey your parents in [ z ] all things : for that is well pleasing unto the Lord .
GNV	Colossians	3	21	[ aa ] Fathers , provoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
GNV	Colossians	3	22	¶ ( F ) [ ab ] Servants , be obedient unto them that are your masters according to the flesh , in all things , not with eye service as men pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God .
GNV	Colossians	3	23	And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not to men ,

GNV	Colossians	3	25	[ ad ] But he that doeth wrong , shall receive for the wrong that he hath done : and there is no respect of persons . Footnotes - Colossians 3:1 Another part of this Epistle , wherein he taketh occasion by the reason of those vain exercises , to show the duty of a Christian life : which is an ordinary thing with him after he hath once set down the doctrine itself . - Colossians 3:1 Our renewing or new birth , which is wrought in us by being partakers of the resurrection of Christ , is the fountain of all holiness , out of which sundry arms or rivers do afterwards flow . - Colossians 3:1 For if we be partakers of Christ , we are carried as it were into another life , where we shall need neither meat nor drink , for we shall be like unto the Angels . - Colossians 3:1 The end and mark which all the duties of Christian life shoot at , is to enter into the kingdom of heaven , and to give ourselves to those things which lead us thither , that is to true godliness , and not to those outward and corporal things . - Colossians 3:2 So he calleth that show of religion , which he spake of in the former Chapter . - Colossians 3:3 A reason taken of the efficient causes and others : you are dead as touching the flesh , that is , touching the old nature which seeketh after all transitory things , and on the other side , you have begun to live according to the Spirit , therefore give yourselves to spiritual and heavenly , and not to carnal and earthly things . - Colossians 3:3 The taking away of an objection : while we are yet in this world , we are subject to many miseries of this life , so that the life that is in us , is as it were hidden : yet notwithstanding we have the beginnings of life and glory , the accomplishment whereof which lieth now in Christ ’ s and in God ’ s hand , shall be assuredly and manifestly performed in that glorious coming of the Lord . - Colossians 3:5 Let not your dead nature be any more effectual in you , but let your living nature be effectual . Now the force of nature is known by the motions . Therefore let the affections of the flesh die in you , and let the contrary motions which are spiritual , live . And he reckoneth up a great long scroll of vices , and their contrary virtues . - Colossians 3:5 The motions and lusts that are in us , are in this place very properly called members , because that the reason and will of man corrupted , doth use them as the body doth his members . - Colossians 3:6 Useth to come . - Colossians 3:9 A definition of our new birth taken of the parts thereof , which are the putting off of the old man , that is to say , of the wickedness which is in us by nature , and the restoring , and repairing of the new man , that is to say , of pureness which is given us by grace : but both of them are but begun in us in this present life , and by certain degrees finished : the one dying in us by little and little , and the other coming to the perfection of another life , by little and little . - Colossians 3:10 Newness of life consisteth in knowledge , which transformeth man to the image of God his maker , that is to say , to the sincerity and pureness of the whole soul . - Colossians 3:10 He speaketh of an effectual knowledge . - Colossians 3:11 He telleth them again , that the Gospel doth not respect those external things , but true justification and sanctification in Christ only , which have many fruits , as he reckoneth them up here : But commendeth two things especially , to wit , godly concord , and continual study of God ’ s word . - Colossians 3:12 So put on , that you never put off . - Colossians 3:12 Those most tender affections of exceeding compassion . - Colossians 3:14 Which bindeth and knitteth together all the duties that pass from man to man . - Colossians 3:15 Rule and govern all things . - Colossians 3:15 You are joined together into one body through God ’ s goodness , that you might help one another as fellow members . - Colossians 3:16 By Psalms he meaneth all godly songs , which were written upon divers occasions , and by hymns , all such as contain the praise of God , and by spiritual songs , other more peculiar and artificious songs which were also in praise of God , but they were made fuller of music . - Colossians 3:17 Call upon the name of Christ , when you do it , or , do it to Christ ’ s praise and glory . - Colossians 3:18 He goeth from precepts which concern the whole civil life of man , to precepts pertaining to every man ’ s family , and requireth of wives , subjection in the Lord . - Colossians 3:18 For those wives do not well , that do not set God in Christ before them in their love , but this Philosophy knoweth not . - Colossians 3:19 He requireth of husbands , that they love their wives , and use them gently . - Colossians 3:20 He requireth of children , that according to God ’ s Commandment they be obedient to their parents . - Colossians 3:20 In the Lord , and so is it expounded , Eph . 5:19 . - Colossians 3:21 Of parents , that they be gentle towards their children . - Colossians 3:22 Of servants that fearing God himself to whom their obedience is acceptable , they reverently , faithfully , and from the heart , obey their masters . - Colossians 3:24 For that that you shall have duly obeyed your masters , the time shall come , that you shall be made sons of servants , and then shall you know this of a surety , which shall be when you are made partakers of the heavenly inheritance . - Colossians 3:25 He requireth of masters that being mindful how that they themselves also shall render an account before that heavenly Lord and Master , which will revenge wrongful doings without any respect of masters or servants , they show themselves just and upright with equity , unto their servants .

GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	Neither yet did we ever use flattering words , as ye know , nor colored covetousness , God is record .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	[ i ] Neither sought we praise of men , neither of you , nor of others , when we might have been [ j ] chargeable , as the Apostles of Christ .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	[ n ] Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily , and justly , and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	[ r ] For brethren , ye are become followers of the Churches of God , which in Judea are in [ s ] Christ Jesus , because ye have also suffered the same things of your own [ t ] country men , even as they have of the Jews ,
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	[ z ] Forasmuch , brethren , as we [ aa ] were kept from you for a season , concerning sight , but not in the heart , we enforced the more to see your face with great desire .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	[ d ] For our exhortation was not by deceit , nor [ e ] by uncleanness , nor by guile .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	[ f ] But as we were [ g ] allowed of God , that the Gospel should be committed unto us , so we speak , not as they that please men , but God , which [ h ] approveth our hearts :
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But we were [ k ] gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children .

GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	[ u ] Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own Prophets , and have persecuted us away , [ v ] and God they please not , and are contrary to [ w ] all men ,
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	And forbid us to preach unto the Gentiles , that they might be saved , to [ x ] fulfill their sins always : for the [ y ] wrath of God is come on them to the utmost .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	Therefore we would have come unto you ( I Paul , at least once or twice ) but Satan hindered us .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? are not even you it in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?

GNV	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	[ b ] But now lately when Timothy came from you unto us , and brought us good tidings of your faith and love , and that ye have good remembrance of us always , desiring to see us , as we also do you ,
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we recompense to God again for you , for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God ,
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself , even our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , guide our journey unto you .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	( A ) And have sent Timothy our brother and minister of God , and our labor fellow in the Gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you touching your faith ,

GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	[ r ] For this say we unto you by the [ s ] word of the Lord , that [ t ] we which live , and are remaining in the coming of the Lord , shall not prevent them which sleep .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	[ f ] And not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the Gentiles which know not God :
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	( B ) [ g ] That no man oppress or defraud his brother in any matter : for the Lord is avenger of all such things , as we also have told you beforetime , and testified .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	( C ) For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that [ h ] despiseth these things , despiseth not man , but God who hath even given you his holy Spirit .
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	Yea , and that thing verily ye do unto all the brethren , which are throughout all Macedonia : but we beseech you brethren , that ye increase more and more ,
GNV	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	[ j ] And that ye study to be quiet , and to meddle with your own business , [ k ] and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you .

GNV	2%20Timothy	2	3	[ c ] Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	4	No man that warreth , entangleth himself with the affairs of [ d ] this life , because he would please him that hath chosen him to be a soldier .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	6	[ f ] The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore I suffer all things for the elect ’ s sake , that they might also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus , with eternal glory .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	15	[ m ] Study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , dividing the word of truth [ n ] aright .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	17	And their word shall fret as a canker : of which sort is Hymenaeus and Philetus .

GNV	2%20Timothy	2	5	[ e ] And if any man also strive for a mastery , he is not crowned , except he strive as he ought to do .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	7	[ g ] Consider what I say : and the Lord give thee understanding in all things .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	8	[ h ] Remember that Jesus Christ , made of the seed of David , was raised again from the dead according to my Gospel ,
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	9	[ i ] Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer , even unto bonds : but the word of God is not bound .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	11	[ j ] It is a true saying , For if we be ( A ) [ k ] dead together with him : we also shall live together with him .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we suffer , we shall also reign together with him : ( B ) if we deny him , he also will deny us .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	13	If ( C ) we believe not , yet abideth he faithful : he can not deny himself .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Of these things put them in remembrance , and [ l ] protest before the Lord , that they strive not about words , which is to no profit , but to the perverting of the hearers .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	16	, he warneth him to exercise himself in weighty matters , and such as pertain to godliness . -

GNV	2%20Timothy	2	23	( F ) And put away foolish and unlearned questions , knowing that they engender strife .
GNV	2%20Timothy	2	24	But the servant of the Lord must not strive , but must be gentle toward all men , apt to teach , [ w ] suffering the evil ,

GNV	2%20Timothy	4	8	For henceforth is laid up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love that his appearing .

GNV	Titus	1	6	( C ) If any be unreproveable , the husband of one wife , having faithful children , which are not slandered of riot , neither are [ m ] disobedient .
GNV	Titus	1	10	[ t ] For there are many disobedient and vain talkers and deceivers of minds , chiefly they of the [ u ] Circumcision ,
GNV	Titus	1	12	[ v ] One of themselves , even one of their own Prophets said , The Cretans are always liars , evil beasts , slow bellies .
GNV	Titus	1	14	And not taking heed to ( D ) Jewish fables and commandments of men , that turn away from the truth .
GNV	Titus	1	2	Tim . 1:9 . - Titus 1:3 This truth is no other where to be sought , but in the preaching of the Apostle . - Titus 1:3 This word ( Savior ) doth not only signify a preserver of life , but also a giver of life . - Titus 1:4 The Apostle moveth the Cretans to hear Titus , by setting forth his consent and agreement with him in the faith , and therewithal showeth by what special note we may distinguish true ministers from false . - Titus 1:4 There is but one way of salvation , common both to the Pastor and the flock . - Titus 1:5 The first admonition , to ordain Elders in every city . - Titus 1:6 This word is proper to horses and oxen , which will not abide the yoke . - Titus 1:7 The second admonition , what faults pastors ( whom he comprehended afore under the word Elders ) ought to be void of , and what virtues they ought to have . - Titus 1:7 Whom the Lord hath appointed steward of his gifts . - Titus 1:7 Not hard conditioned , and evil to please . - Titus 1:8 Circumspect , of a sound judgment , and of a singular example of moderation . - Titus 1:9 The third admonition : The Pastor must hold fast that doctrine , which the Apostles delivered , and pertaineth to salvation , leaving all curious and vain matters . - Titus 1:9 The fourth admonition : To apply the knowledge of true doctrine unto use , which consisteth in two things , to wit , in governing them which show themselves apt to learn , and confuting the obstinate . - Titus 1:10 An applying of the general proposition to a particular : The Cretans above all others need sharp reprehensions : both because their minds are naturally given to lies and slothfulness , and also because of certain covetous Jews , which under a color of godliness joined partly certain vain traditions , and partly old ceremonies with the Gospel . - Titus 1:10 Of the Jews , or rather of those Jews , which went about to join Christ and the Law together . - Titus 1:12 Epimenides , who was counted a Prophet amongst them . Look upon Laertius and Cicero in his first book of Divination . - Titus 1:13 Roughly and plainly , and go not about the bush with them . - Titus 1:15 He showeth in few words , that purity consisteth not in any external worship , and that that is according to the old Law , ( as in difference of meats , and washing , and other such things which are abolished ) but in the mind and conscience : and whosoever teach otherwise , know not what is true religion indeed , and also are nothing less than that they would seem to be . - Titus 1:15 If our minds and conscience be unclean , what cleanness is there in us before regeneration ?

GNV	Titus	1	3	[ h ] But hath made his word manifest in due time through the preaching , which is ( B ) committed unto me according to the commandment of God our [ i ] Savior :
GNV	Titus	1	4	[ j ] To Titus my natural son according to the common faith , [ k ] Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
GNV	Titus	1	5	[ l ] For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest continue to redress the things that remain , and shouldest ordain Elders in every city as I ap-pointed thee .
GNV	Titus	1	7	[ n ] For a Bishop must be unreproveable , as God ’ s [ o ] steward , not [ p ] froward , not angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ,
GNV	Titus	1	8	But harberous , one that loveth goodness , [ q ] wise , righteous , holy , temperate ,
GNV	Titus	1	9	[ r ] Holding fast that faithful word according to doctrine , [ s ] that he also may be able to exhort with wholesome doctrine , and convince them that say against it .
GNV	Titus	1	11	Whose mouths must be stopped , which subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre ’ s sake .
GNV	Titus	1	13	This witness is true : wherefore convince them [ w ] sharply , that they may be sound in the faith .
GNV	Titus	1	15	[ x ] Unto the pure ( E ) are all things pure , but unto them that are defiled , and unbelieving , is nothing pure , but even their [ y ] minds and consciences are defiled .
GNV	Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God , but by works they deny him , and are abominable and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .

GNV	Titus	2	15	These things speak , and exhort , and convince with all [ l ] authority . See that no man despise thee .

GNV	Titus	3	10	[ g ] Reject him that is an heretic , after once or twice admonition ,

GNV	Titus	3	6	Which he shed on us abundantly , through Jesus Christ our Savior ,
GNV	Titus	3	7	That we , being justified by his grace , should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .

GNV	Philemon	1	6	That the [ a ] fellowship of thy faith may be made effectual , and that whatsoever good thing is in you through Christ Jesus , may be [ b ] known .
GNV	Philemon	1	7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because by thee , brother , the Saints [ c ] bowels are comforted .
GNV	Philemon	1	9	[ d ] Yet for love ’ s sake I rather beseech thee , though I be as I am , even Paul aged , and even now a prisoner for Jesus Christ .
GNV	Philemon	1	10	I beseech thee for my son ( B ) Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds ,
GNV	Philemon	1	11	Which in times past was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable both to thee and to me .
GNV	Philemon	1	12	Whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is mine own [ e ] bowels ,
GNV	Philemon	1	13	Whom I would have received with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the Gospel .
GNV	Philemon	1	14	But without thy mind would I do nothing , that thy benefit should not be as it were of [ f ] necessity , but willingly .
GNV	Philemon	1	15	It may be that he therefore [ g ] departed for [ h ] a season , that thou shouldest receive him forever ,
GNV	Philemon	1	16	Not now as a servant , but above a servant , even as a brother beloved , specially to me : how much more then unto thee , both in the [ i ] flesh and in the Lord ?
GNV	Philemon	1	17	If therefore thou count our things common , receive him as myself .
GNV	Philemon	1	18	If he hath hurt thee , or oweth thee ought , that put on my accounts .
GNV	Philemon	1	19	I Paul have written this with mine own hand : I will recompense it , albeit I do not say to thee , that thou owest moreover unto me even thine own self .
GNV	Philemon	1	20	[ j ] Yea , brother , let me obtain this pleasure of thee in the Lord : comfort my bowels in the Lord .
GNV	Philemon	1	21	Trusting in thine obedience , I wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say ,
GNV	Philemon	1	22	Moreover also prepare me lodging : for I trust through your prayers I shall be freely given unto you .

Footnotes - Hebrews 1:1 The first part of the general proposition of this Epistle : the Son of God is indeed that Prophet or teacher , which hath actually now performed that that God after a sort and in shadows signified by his Prophets , and hath fully opened his Father ’ s will to the world . - Hebrews 1:1 So that the former declaration made by the Prophets was not full , and nothing must be added to this latter . - Hebrews 1:1 Which one Son is God and man . - Hebrews 1:2 The second part of the same proposition : The same Son is appointed by the Father to be our King and Lord , by whom also he made all things , and in whom only he setteth forth his glory , yea and himself also to be beholden of us , who beareth up and sustaineth all things by his will and pleasure . - Hebrews 1:2 Possessor and equal compartner of all things with the Father . - Hebrews 1:2 That is , whatsoever hath been at any time , is , or shall be . - Hebrews 1:3 He in whom that glory and Majesty of the Father shineth , who is otherwise infinite , and can not be beholden . - Hebrews 1:3 His father ’ s person . - Hebrews 1:3 Sustaineth , defendeth and cherisheth . - Hebrews 1:3 The third part of the same proposition .

GNV	Hebrews	2	1	Wherefore [ a ] we ought diligently to give heed to the things which [ b ] we have heard , lest at any time we [ c ] run out .
GNV	Hebrews	2	9	[ p ] But we [ q ] see Jesus crowned with glory and honor , ( D ) which was made little [ r ] inferior to the Angels , [ s ] through the [ t ] suffering of death , that by God ’ s grace he might [ u ] taste death for [ v ] all men .
GNV	Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation , [ e ] which at the first began to be preached by the Lord , and afterward was confirmed unto us by [ f ] them that heard him .
GNV	Hebrews	2	4	( A ) God bearing witness thereto , both with [ g ] signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the holy Ghost , according to his own will ?
GNV	Hebrews	2	5	[ h ] For he hath not put in subjection unto the Angels the [ i ] world to come , whereof we speak .
GNV	Hebrews	2	6	[ j ] But ( B ) one in a certain place witnessed , saying , [ k ] What is man , that thou shouldest be mindful of him ? or the [ l ] son of man , that thou wouldest consider him ?
GNV	Hebrews	2	7	Thou [ m ] madest him a little inferior to the Angels : thou crownedst him with [ n ] glory and honor , and hast set him above the works of thine hands .
GNV	Hebrews	2	8	( C ) Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . And in that he hath put all things in subjection under him , he left nothing that should not be subject unto him . [ o ] But we yet see not all things subdued unto him ,
GNV	Hebrews	2	10	[ w ] For it became [ x ] him , for whom are all these things , and by whom are all these things , [ y ] seeing that he brought many children unto glory , [ z ] that he should consecrate the [ aa ] Prince of their salvation through afflictions .
GNV	Hebrews	2	11	[ ab ] For he that [ ac ] sanctifieth , and they which are sanctified , are all of [ ad ] one : wherefore he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
GNV	Hebrews	2	12	[ ae ] Saying , ( E ) I will declare thy Name unto my brethren : in the midst of the Church will I sing praises to thee .
GNV	Hebrews	2	13	[ af ] And again , ( F ) I will put my [ ag ] trust in him . And again , ( G ) [ ah ] Behold , here am I , and the children which God hath given me .
GNV	Hebrews	2	14	Forasmuch then as the children are [ ai ] partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself likewise took part with them , that he might destroy ( H ) through death , him that had the [ aj ] power of death , that is , the [ ak ] devil ,
GNV	Hebrews	2	15	And that he might deliver all them , which for fear of [ al ] death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
GNV	Hebrews	2	16	[ am ] For he in no sort took on him the [ an ] Angels ’ nature , but he took on him the [ ao ] seed of Abraham .
GNV	Hebrews	2	17	[ ap ] Wherefore in [ aq ] all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be [ ar ] merciful , and a [ as ] faithful high Priest in things concerning God , that he might make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
GNV	Hebrews	2	18	For in that he suffered , and was [ at ] tempted , he is able to succor them that are tempted . Footnotes - Hebrews 2:1 Now as it were pausing with himself and showing to what end and purpose all these things were spoken , to wit , to understand by the excellency of Christ above all creatures , that his doctrine , majesty and Priesthood is most perfect , he useth an exhortation taken from a comparison . - Hebrews 2:1 He maketh himself an hearer . - Hebrews 2:1 They are said to let the word run out , which hold it not fast when they have heard it . - Hebrews 2:2 The Law which appointed punishment for the offenders : and which Paul saith was given by Angels , Gal . 3:19 , and Stephen , Acts 7:53 . - Hebrews 2:3 If the breach and trangression of the word spoken by Angels was not suffered unpunished , much less shall it be lawful for us to neglect the Gospel which the Lord of Angels preached , and was confirmed by the voice of the Apostles , and with so many signs and wonders from heaven , and especially with so great and mighty working of the holy Ghost . - Hebrews 2:3 By the Apostles . - Hebrews 2:4 This is the true end of miracles . Now they are called signs , because they appear one thing , and represent another : and they are called wonders , because they represent some strange and unaccustomed things and virtues , because they give us a glimpse of God ’ s mighty power . - Hebrews 2:5 If it were an heinous matter to contemn the Angels which are but servants , much more heinous is it to contemn that most mighty King of the restored world . - Hebrews 2:5 The world to come , whereof Christ is Father , Isa . 9:6 , or the Church , which as a new world , was to be gathered together by the Gospel . - Hebrews 2:6 He showeth that the use of this kingly dignity consisteth herein , that men might not only [ in ] Christ recover that dignity which they have lost , but also might be through him advanced above all things , which dignity of men David describeth most excellently . - Hebrews 2:6 What is there in man that thou shouldest have so great regard of him , and do him that honor ? - Hebrews 2:6 He calleth all the citizens of that heavenly kingdom as they are considered in themselves , before that God giveth them the liberty , of that city in Christ , Man , and Son of man . - Hebrews 2:7 This is the first honor of the citizens of the world to come , that they are next [ to ] the Angels . - Hebrews 2:7 For they shall be in very great honor , when they shall be partakers of the kingdom . And he speaketh of the thing that shall be , as though it were already , because it is so certain . - Hebrews 2:8 An objection : But where is this so great rule and dominion ? - Hebrews 2:9 The answer : this is already fulfilled in Jesus Christ our head , who was for a time for our sakes inferior to the Angels , being made man : but now is advanced into most high glory . - Hebrews 2:9 By his virtue and power which appeareth manifestly in the Church . - Hebrews 2:9 Who abased himself for a season , and took upon him the position of a servant . - Hebrews 2:9 He showeth the cause of this subjection , to wit , to taste of death for our sakes , that so doing the part of a redeemer , he might not only be our Prophet and King , but also our high Priest . - Hebrews 2:9 That he might die . - Hebrews 2:9 Feel death . - Hebrews 2:9 Herein consisteth the force of the argument : for we could not at length be glorified with him , unless he was abased for us even all the faithful . And by this occasion the Apostle cometh to the other part of the declaration of Christ ’ s person , wherein he proveth him to be in such sort God , and he is also man . - Hebrews 2:10 He proveth moreover by other arguments , why it behooveth the Son of God who is true God ( as he proveth a little before ) to become man notwithstanding , subject to all miseries , sin only except . - Hebrews 2:10 God . - Hebrews 2:10 First of all , because the Father , to whose glory all these things are to be referred , purposed to bring many sons unto glory . And how could he have men for his sons , unless his only begotten Son had become brother to men ? - Hebrews 2:10 Secondly , The Father determined to bring those sons to glory , to wit , out of that ignominy wherein they lay before . Therefore the Son should not have been seen plainly to be made man , unless he had been made like unto other men , that he might come to glory in the selfsame way , by which he should bring others : yea rather , it became him which was Prince of the salvation of others , to be consecrated above others , through those afflictions , Prophet , King , and Priest , which are the parts of that principality for the salvation of others . - Hebrews 2:10 The Chieftain , who as he is chiefest in dignity , so is he the first begotten from among the dead , amongst many brethren . - Hebrews 2:11 The ground of both the former arguments : for neither should we be sons through him , neither could he be consecrated through afflictions , unless he hath been made man like unto us . But because this Sonhood dependeth not upon nature only , for no man is accompted the son of God , unless that besides that he is a son of a man , he be also Christ ’ s brother , ( which is by sanctification , that is , by becoming one with Christ , who sanctifieth us through faith ) therefore the Apostle maketh mention of the sanctifier , to wit , of Christ , and of them that are sanctified , to wit , of all the faithful , whom therefore Christ vouchsafeth to call brethren . - Hebrews 2:11 He useth the time that now is , to show us that we are yet still going on , and increasing in this sanctification , and by sanctification he meaneth our separation from the rest of the world , our cleansing from sin , and our dedication wholly unto God , all which Christ alone worketh in us . - Hebrews 2:11 One , of one selfsame nature of man . - Hebrews 2:12 That which he taught before of the incarnation of the sanctifier , he applieth to the prophetical office . - Hebrews 2:13 He applieth the same to the kingly power of Christ in delivering his from the power of the devil and death . - Hebrews 2:13 I will commit myself to him , and to his defense . - Hebrews 2:13 This Isaiah speaketh of himself and his disciples , but betokening thereby all ministers , as also his disciples signify the whole Church . And therefore seeing Christ is the head of the Prophets and ministers , these words are more rightly verified of him , than of Isaiah . - Hebrews 2:14 Are made of flesh and blood which is a frail and brittle nature . - Hebrews 2:14 The devil is said to have the power of death , because he is the author of sin : and from sin cometh death , and for this cause he eggeth us daily to sin . - Hebrews 2:14 He speaketh of one as of the Prince , joining to him secretly all his angels . - Hebrews 2:15 By ( death ) thou must understand here that death which is joined with the wrath of God , as it must needs be , if it be without Christ , then there can be nothing devised more miserable . - Hebrews 2:16 He expoundeth those words of flesh and blood , showing that Christ is true man , and not by turning his divine nature , but by taking on man ’ s nature . And he nameth Abraham , respecting the promises made to Abraham in this behalf . - Hebrews 2:16 The nature of Angels . - Hebrews 2:16 The very nature of man . - Hebrews 2:17 He applieth the same to the Priesthood , for which he should not have benefit , unless he had become man , and that like unto us in all things , sin only except . - Hebrews 2:17 Not only as touching nature , but qualities also . - Hebrews 2:17 That he might be truly touched with the feeling of our miseries . - Hebrews 2:17 Doing his office sincerely . - Hebrews 2:18 Was tried and egged to wickedness by the devil .

GNV	Hebrews	3	1	Therefore , [ a ] holy brethren , partakers of the heavenly vocation , consider the [ b ] Apostle and high Priest of our [ c ] profession Christ Jesus :
GNV	Hebrews	3	5	[ h ] Now Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a witness of the things which should be spoken after .
GNV	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is as the Son , over his own house , [ i ] whose [ j ] house we are , if we hold fast that [ k ] confidence and that rejoicing of that hope unto the end .
GNV	Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts , as in the [ m ] provocation , according to the day of the temptation in the wilderness ,
GNV	Hebrews	3	12	[ o ] Take heed brethren , lest at any time there be in any of you an evil heart , and unfaithful , to depart away from the living God .
GNV	Hebrews	3	2	[ d ] Who was faithful to him that hath [ e ] appointed him , [ f ] even as ( A ) Moses was in all his house .
GNV	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is builded of some man , and he that hath built all things , is God .
GNV	Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore , as the holy Ghost saith , ( B ) Today if ye [ l ] shall hear his voice ,
GNV	Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my works forty years long .
GNV	Hebrews	3	10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , They [ n ] err ever in their heart , neither have they known my ways .
GNV	Hebrews	3	11	Therefore I swear in my wrath , If they shall enter into my rest .
GNV	Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another daily , [ p ] while it is called today , lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
GNV	Hebrews	3	14	of the next Chapter , and with Aaron touching the Priesthood . And he propoundeth that which he purposeth to speak of , with a most grave exhortation , that all our faith may tend to Christ , as to the only everlasting teacher , governor , and high Priest . - Hebrews 3:1 The Ambassador or messenger , as Rom . 1:5 , he is called the minister of circumcision . - Hebrews 3:1 Of the doctrine of the Gospel which we profess . - Hebrews 3:2 He confirmeth this exhortation with two reasons , first of all because Christ Jesus was appointed such an one of God : secondly , because he thoroughly executed the offices that his Father enjoined him . - Hebrews 3:2 Apostle and high Priest . - Hebrews 3:2 Now he cometh to the comparison with Moses , and he maketh them like one to the other in this , that they were both appointed rulers over God ’ s house , and executed faithfully their office : but by and by after he showeth that there is great unlikeness in that similitude . - Hebrews 3:3 The first comparison : The builder of the house is better than the house itself , therefore is Christ better than Moses . The reason of the consequent is this : because the builder of this house is God , which can not be attributed to Moses : and therefore Moses was not properly the builder , but a part of the house : but Christ as Lord and God , made all this house . - Hebrews 3:5 Another comparison : Moses was a faithful servant in this house , that is , in the Church , seeing the Lord that was to come , but Christ ruleth and governeth his house as Lord . - Hebrews 3:6 He applieth the former doctrine to this end , exhorting all men by the words of David to hear the Son himself speak , and to give full credit to his words , seeing that otherwise they can not enter into that eternal rest . - Hebrews 3:6 To wit , Christ ’ s . - Hebrews 3:6 He calleth that excellent effect of faith ( whereby we cry , Abba , that is , Father ) confidence , and to confidence he joineth hope . - Hebrews 3:7 So that God was to speak once again after Moses . - Hebrews 3:8 In the day that they vexed the Lord , or strove with him . - Hebrews 3:10 They are brutish and mad . - Hebrews 3:12 Now weighing the words of David , he showeth first by this word , Today that we must not neglect the occasion while we have it : for that word is not to be restrained to David ’ s time , but it comprehendeth all the time wherein God calleth us . - Hebrews 3:13 While today lasteth , that is to say , so long as the Gospel is offered to us . - Hebrews 3:14 Now he considereth these words , If you hear his voice , etc. , showing that they are spoken and meant of the hearing of faith , against which he setteth hardening through unbelief . - Hebrews 3:14 That beginning of trust and confidence : and after the manner of the Hebrews , he calleth that beginning , which is chiefest . - Hebrews 3:15 So long as this voice soundeth out . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Hebrews	3	15	[ s ] So long as it is said , Today if ye hear his voice , harden not your hearts , as in the provocation .
GNV	Hebrews	3	16	For some when they heard , provoked him to anger : howbeit , not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
GNV	Hebrews	3	17	But with whom was he displeased forty years ? Was he not displeased with them that sinned , ( C ) whose carcasses fell in the wilderness ?
GNV	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest , but unto them that obeyed not ?
GNV	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they could not enter in , because of unbelief . Footnotes - Hebrews 3:1 Having laid the foundation , that is to say , declared and proved both the natures of one selfsame Christ , he giveth him three offices , to wit , the office of a Prophet , king , and Priest : and as touching the office of teaching and governing , compareth them with Moses and Joshua , unto verse
GNV	Hebrews	4	4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , ( B ) And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .

GNV	Hebrews	4	1	Let us fear therefore , lest at any time by forsaking the promise of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to be deprived .
GNV	Hebrews	4	11	[ f ] Let us study therefore to enter into that rest , lest [ g ] any man fall after the same example of disobedience .
GNV	Hebrews	4	14	[ n ] Seeing then that we have a great high Priest , which is entered into heaven , even Jesus the Son of God , let us [ o ] hold fast our profession .
GNV	Hebrews	4	2	[ a ] For unto us was the Gospel preached as also unto them : but the word that they heard , profited not them , because it was not [ b ] mixed with faith in those that heard it .
GNV	Hebrews	4	3	[ c ] For we which have believed , do enter into rest , as he said to the other , ( A ) As I have sworn in my wrath , If they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
GNV	Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest .
GNV	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter thereinto , and they to whom it was first preached , entered not therein for unbelief ’ s sake :
GNV	Hebrews	4	7	Again he appointed in David a certain day , by Today , after so long a time , saying , as it is said , ( C ) This day , if ye hear his voice , harden not your hearts .
GNV	Hebrews	4	8	For if [ d ] Jesus had given them rest , then would he not after this have spoken of another day .
GNV	Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God .
GNV	Hebrews	4	10	[ e ] For he that is entered into his rest , hath also ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
GNV	Hebrews	4	12	[ h ] For the [ i ] word of God is [ j ] lively , and mighty in operation , and sharper than any two edged sword , and entereth through , even unto the dividing asunder of the [ k ] soul and the [ l ] spirit , and of the joints , and the marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts , and the intents of the heart .
GNV	Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature , which is not manifest in [ m ] his sight : but all things are naked and open unto his eyes , with whom we have to do .
GNV	Hebrews	4	15	[ p ] For we have not an high Priest , which can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but was in all things tempted in like sort , yet without sin .
GNV	Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore go boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and find grace to help in time of need . Footnotes - Hebrews 4:2 By these words , His voice , he showeth that David meant the preaching of Christ , who was then also preached , for Moses and the Prophets respected none other . - Hebrews 4:2 He compareth the preaching of the Gospel to drink , which being drunk , that is to say , heard , profiteth nothing , unless it be tempered with faith . - Hebrews 4:3 Lest any man should object , that those words were meant of the Land of Canaan , and of Moses ’ doctrine , and therefore can not well be drawn to Christ , and to eternal life , the Apostle showeth that there are two manner of rests spoken of in the Scriptures : the one , of the seventh day , wherein God is said to have rested from all his works : the other is said to be that same , whereinto Joshua led the people : but this rest is not the last rest whereto we are called and that he proveth by two reasons . For seeing that David so long time after , speaking to the people which were then placed in the land of Canaan , useth these words , Today , and threateneth them still that they shall not enter into the rest of God , which refuseth then the voice of God that sounded in their ears , we must needs say that he meant another time than the time of Moses , and another rest than the rest of the land of Canaan : And that is , that everlasting rest , wherein we begin to live to God , after that the race of this life ceaseth : as God resteth the seventh day from those his works , that is to say , from making the world . Moreover , the Apostle therewithal signifieth that the way to this rest , which Moses and the land of Canaan and all that order of the Law did shadow , is opened in the Gospel only . - Hebrews 4:8 He speaketh of Joshua the son of Nun : and as the land of Canaan was a figure of our true rest , so was Joshua a figure of Christ . - Hebrews 4:10 As God rested the seventh day , so must we rest from our works , that is , from such as proceed from our corrupt nature . - Hebrews 4:11 He returneth to an exhortation . - Hebrews 4:11 Lest any man become a like example of infidelity . - Hebrews 4:12 An amplification taken from the nature of the word of God , the power whereof is such , that it entereth even to the deepest and most inward and secret parts of the heart , wounding them deadly that are stubborn , and plainly quickening the believers . - Hebrews 4:12 The doctrine of God which is preached both in the Law and in the Gospel . - Hebrews 4:12 He calleth the word of God lively by reason of the effects it worketh in them , to whom it is preached . - Hebrews 4:12 He calleth that the soul , which hath the affections resident in it . - Hebrews 4:12 By the spirit he meaneth that nobelest part which is called the mind . - Hebrews 4:13 In God ’ s sight . - Hebrews 4:14 Now he entereth into the comparison of Christ ’ s Priesthood with Aaron ’ s , and declareth even in the very beginning the marvelous excellency of this Priesthood , calling him the Son of God and placing him in the seat of God in heaven , plainly and evidently setting him against Aaron ’ s Priests , and the transitory tabernacle : which comparisons he setteth forth afterward more at large . - Hebrews 4:14 And let it not go out of your hands . - Hebrews 4:15 Lest he might seem by this great glory of our high Priest , to stay and stop us from going unto him , he addeth straightways after , that he is notwithstanding our brother indeed , ( as he proved it also before ) and that he accounteth all our miseries , as his own , to call us boldly to him .

GNV	Hebrews	5	5	So likewise Christ took not to himself this honor to be made the high Priest , but he that said unto him , ( B ) Thou art my son , this day begat I thee , gave it him .

GNV	Hebrews	5	1	For [ a ] every high Priest is taken from among men , and is ordained for men , in things pertaining to God , [ b ] that he may offer both [ c ] gifts and [ d ] sacrifices for sins .
GNV	Hebrews	5	7	[ j ] Who in the [ k ] days of his flesh did offer up prayers and supplications , with strong crying and tears unto him , that was able to [ l ] save him from death , and was also heard in that which he feared .
GNV	Hebrews	5	2	Which is [ e ] able sufficiently to have compassion [ f ] on them that are ignorant , and that are out of the way , because that he also is [ g ] compassed with infirmity ,
GNV	Hebrews	5	3	And for the same sake he is bound to offer for sins , as well for his own part , as for the peoples .
GNV	Hebrews	5	4	( A ) [ h ] And no man taketh this honor unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
GNV	Hebrews	5	6	As he also in another place speaketh , ( C ) Thou art a Priest forever , after the [ i ] order of Melchizedek ,
GNV	Hebrews	5	8	And though he were the Son , yet [ m ] learned he obedience , by the things which he suffered .
GNV	Hebrews	5	9	[ n ] And being [ o ] consecrated , was made the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him :
GNV	Hebrews	5	10	And is called of God an high Priest after the order of Melchizedek .
GNV	Hebrews	5	11	[ p ] Of whom we have many things to say , which are hard to be uttered , because ye are dull of hearing .
GNV	Hebrews	5	12	[ q ] For when as concerning the time ye ought to be teachers , yet have ye need again that we teach you what are the first principles of the word of God : and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .

GNV	Hebrews	6	1	Therefore , leaving the doctrine of the [ a ] beginning of Christ , let us be led forward unto perfection , [ b ] not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	4	( A ) [ c ] For it is [ d ] impossible that they which were once lightened , and have [ e ] tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the holy Ghost ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	7	[ g ] For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing of God .
GNV	Hebrews	6	9	[ h ] But beloved , we have persuaded ourselves better things of you , and such as accompany salvation , though we thus speak .
GNV	Hebrews	6	13	[ k ] For when God made the promise to Abraham , because he had no greater to swear by , he swore by himself ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	17	So God , willing more [ m ] abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the stableness of his counsel , bound himself by an oath ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	19	[ n ] Which hope we have , as an anchor of the soul , but sure and steadfast , and it entereth into that which is within the veil .
GNV	Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms , and laying on of hands , and of the resurrection from the dead , and of eternal judgment .
GNV	Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do if God permit .
GNV	Hebrews	6	5	And have tasted of the good word of God , and of the powers of the world to come ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	8	But that which beareth thorns and briars , is reproved , and is near unto cursing , whose end is to be burned .
GNV	Hebrews	6	10	[ i ] For God is not unrighteous , that he should forget your work , and labor of love , which ye showed toward his Name , in that ye have ministered unto the Saints , and yet minister .
GNV	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence , to the full assurance of hope unto the end ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	12	[ j ] That ye be not slothful , but followers of them , which through faith and patience , inherit the promises .
GNV	Hebrews	6	14	Saying , ( B ) Surely I will [ l ] abundantly bless thee , and multiply thee marvelously .
GNV	Hebrews	6	15	And so after that he had tarried patiently , he enjoyed the promise .
GNV	Hebrews	6	16	For men verily swear by him that is greater than themselves , and an oath for confirmation is among them an end of all strife .
GNV	Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things , wherein it is impossible that God should lie , we might have strong consolation , which have our refuge to lay hold upon that hope that is set before us ,
GNV	Hebrews	6	20	[ o ] Whither the forerunner is for us entered in , even Jesus that is made an high Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . Footnotes - Hebrews 6:1 The first principles of Christian religion , which we call the Catechism . - Hebrews 6:1 Certain principles of a Catechism , which comprehend the sum of the doctrine of the Gospel , were given in few words and briefly to the rude and ignorant , to wit , the profession of repentance and faith in God : the articles of which doctrine , were demanded of them which were not as yet received members of the Church , at the days appointed for Baptism : and of the children of the faithful which were baptized in their infancy : when hands were laid upon them . And of those articles , two are by name recited : the resurrection of the flesh , and the eternal judgment . - Hebrews 6:4 He addeth a vehemency to his exhortation , and a most sharp threatening of the certain destruction that shall come to them which fall from God and his religion . - Hebrews 6:4 He speaketh of a general backsliding , and such as do altogether fall away from the faith , and not of sins which are committed through the frailty of man against the first and the second table . - Hebrews 6:4 We must mark the force of this word , for it is one thing to believe as Lydia did , whose heart God opened , Acts 16:13 , and another thing to have some taste . - Hebrews 6:6 As men that hate Christ , and as though they crucified him again make him a mocking stock to all the world , and that to their own destruction , as Julian the Apostate or backslider did . - Hebrews 6:7 He setteth forth the former threatening with a similitude . - Hebrews 6:9 He mitigateth and assuageth all that sharpness , hoping better of them to whom he writeth . - Hebrews 6:10 He praiseth them for their charity , thereby encouraging them to go forward , and to hold out to the end . - Hebrews 6:12 He showeth what virtues chiefly they have need of to go forward constantly , and also to profit : to wit , of charity , and patience : and lest any man should object and say , that these things are impossible to be done , he willeth them to set before themselves the examples of their ancestors , and to follow them . - Hebrews 6:13 Another prick to prick them forward : Because the hope of the inheritance is certain , if we continue to the end , for God hath not only promised it , but also promised it with an oath . - Hebrews 6:14 I will heap up benefits most plentifully upon thee . - Hebrews 6:17 More than was needful , were it not for the wickedness of men which believe not God , no though he swear . - Hebrews 6:19 He likeneth hope to an anchor : because that even as an anchor being cast into the bottom of the sea , stayeth the whole ship , so doth hope also enter even into the very secret places of heaven . And he maketh mention of the Sanctuary , alluding to the old tabernacle , and by this means returneth to the comparisons of the Priesthood of Christ with the Levitical . - Hebrews 6:20 He repeateth David ’ s words , wherein all those comparisons whereof he hath before made mention , are signified , as he declareth in all the next chapter .

GNV	Hebrews	7	1	For this [ a ] Melchizedek ( A ) was King of Salem , the Priest of the most high God , who met Abraham , as he returned from the slaughter of the Kings , and [ b ] blessed him :
GNV	Hebrews	7	15	[ m ] And it is yet a more evident thing , because that after the similitude of Melchizedek , there is risen up another Priest ,
GNV	Hebrews	7	20	[ r ] And forasmuch as it is not without an oath ( for these are made Priests without an oath :
GNV	Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham gave the tithe of all things : who first is by interpretation King of righteousness : after that , he is also King of Salem , that is , King of peace ,
GNV	Hebrews	7	3	[ c ] Without father , without mother , without kindred , and hath neither beginning of his days , neither end of life : but is likened unto the Son of God , and continueth a Priest forever .
GNV	Hebrews	7	4	[ d ] Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the Patriarch Abraham gave the tithe of the spoils .
GNV	Hebrews	7	5	For verily they which are the children of Levi , which receive the office of the Priesthood , have a ( B ) commandment to take , according to the Law , tithes of the people ( that is , of their brethren ) though they [ e ] came out of the loins of Abraham .
GNV	Hebrews	7	6	But he whose kindred is not counted among them , received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
GNV	Hebrews	7	8	And here men that die , receive tithes : but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed , that he liveth .
GNV	Hebrews	7	9	[ g ] And to say as the thing is , Levi also which receiveth tithes , payeth tithes in Abraham .
GNV	Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father Abraham , when Melchizedek met him .
GNV	Hebrews	7	11	[ h ] If therefore [ i ] perfection had been by the Priesthood of the Levites ( for under it the Law was established to the people ) what needed it furthermore , that another Priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek , and not to be called after the order of Aaron ?
GNV	Hebrews	7	12	[ j ] For if the Priesthood be changed , then of necessity must there be a change of the [ k ] Law .
GNV	Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken , pertaineth unto another tribe , whereof no man [ l ] served at the altar .
GNV	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident , that our Lord sprung out of Judah , concerning the which tribe Moses spake nothing , touching the Priesthood .
GNV	Hebrews	7	16	[ n ] Which is not made Priest after the [ o ] Law of the carnal commandment , but after the power of the endless life .
GNV	Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth thus , ( C ) Thou art a Priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek .
GNV	Hebrews	7	18	[ p ] For the [ q ] commandment that went afore , is disannulled , because of the weakness thereof , and unprofitableness .
GNV	Hebrews	7	19	For the Law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope made perfect , whereby we draw near unto God .
GNV	Hebrews	7	21	But this is made with an oath by him that said unto him , ( D ) The Lord hath sworn , and will not repent , Thou art a Priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . )
GNV	Hebrews	7	22	By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better Testament .
GNV	Hebrews	7	23	[ s ] And among them many were made Priests , because they were not suffered to endure , by the reason of death .
GNV	Hebrews	7	24	But this man , because he endureth ever , hath a Priesthood , which [ t ] can not pass from one to another .
GNV	Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore , he is [ u ] able also perfectly to save them that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth , to make intercession for them .
GNV	Hebrews	7	26	[ v ] For such an high Priest it became us to have , which is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens :
GNV	Hebrews	7	27	Which needeth not daily as those high Priests to offer up sacrifice , ( E ) first for his own sins , and then for the peoples : [ w ] for [ x ] that did he [ y ] once , when he offered up himself .
GNV	Hebrews	7	28	For the Law maketh men high Priests , which have infirmity : but the [ z ] word of the oath [ aa ] that [ ab ] was since the Law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore . Footnotes - Hebrews 7:1 Declaring those words , According to the order of Melchizedek , whereupon that comparison standeth of the Priesthood of Christ with the Levitical : first Melchizedek himself is considered as the figure of Christ , and these are the hands of that comparison , Melchizedek was a King and a Priest : and such an one indeed is Christ alone . He was a King of peace and righteousness : such an one indeed is Christ alone . - Hebrews 7:1 With a solemn and Priestly blessing . - Hebrews 7:3 Another figure : Melchizedek set before us to be considered as one without beginning and without ending , for neither his father , nor his mother , nor his ancestors , nor his death are written of : and such an one indeed is the Son of God , to wit , an everlasting Priest : as he is God , without mother wonderfully begotten : as he is man , without father wonderfully conceived . - Hebrews 7:4 Another figure : Melchizedek in consideration of his Priesthood was above Abraham , for he took tenths of him , and blessed him as a Priest : Such an one indeed is Christ , upon whom dependeth even Abraham ’ s sanctification , and all the believers , and whom all men ought to worship and reverence as the author of all . - Hebrews 7:5 Were begotten by Abraham . - Hebrews 7:7 He speaketh of the public blessing which the Priests used . - Hebrews 7:9 A double amplification : The first , that Melchizedek took the tenths , as one immortal ( to wit , in respect , that he is the figure of Christ , for his death is in no place made mention of , and David setteth him forth as an everlasting Priest ) but the Levitical Priests , as mortal men , for they succeed one another : the second , that Levi himself was tithed in Abraham by Melchizedek . Therefore the Priesthood of Melchizedek ( that is , Christ ’ s who is pronounced to be an everlasting Priest according to his order ) is more excellent than the Levitical . - Hebrews 7:11 The third treatise of this Epistle , wherein after he hath proved Christ to be a King , a Prophet , and a Priest , he now handleth distinctly the condition and excellency of all these offices , showing that all these were but shadows in all other , but in Christ they are true and perfect . And he beginneth with the Priesthood , wherewith also the former treatise ended , that by this means all the parts and members of this disputation , may better hang together . And first of all he proveth that the Levitical Priesthood was imperfect because another Priest is promised a long time after according to another order , that is to say , of another manner of rule and fashion . - Hebrews 7:11 If the priesthood of Levi could have made any man perfect . - Hebrews 7:12 He showeth how that by the institution of the new Priesthood , not only the imperfection of the Priesthood of Levi was declared , but also that it was changed for this : for these two can not stand together , because that first appointment of the tribe of Levi , did shut forth the tribe of Judah , and made it also inferior to Levi : and this latter doth place the Priesthood in the tribe of Judah . - Hebrews 7:12 Of the institution of Aaron . - Hebrews 7:13 Had anything to do about the altar . - Hebrews 7:15 Lest any man might object , that the Priesthood indeed was translated from Levi to Judah , but yet notwithstanding the same remaineth still , he both weigheth and expoundeth these words of David , forever , according to the order of Melchizedek , whereby also a divers institution of priesthood is well perceived . - Hebrews 7:16 He proveth the diversity and excellency of the institution of Melchizedek ’ s Priesthood , by this , that the priesthood of the Law did stand upon an outward and bodily anointing : but the sacrifice of Melchizedek is set out to be everlasting and more spiritual . - Hebrews 7:16 Not after the ordination , which commandeth frail and transitory things , as was done in Aaron ’ s consecration , and all that whole Priesthood . - Hebrews 7:18 Again , that no man might object that the last Priesthood was added to make a perfect one , by the coupling of them both together , he proveth that the first was abrogated by the latter as unprofitable , and that by the nature of them both . For how could those corporal and transitory things sanctify us , either of themselves , or being joined with another ? - Hebrews 7:18 The ceremonial law . - Hebrews 7:20 Another argument whereby he proveth that the Priesthood of Christ is better than the Priesthood of Levi , because his was established with an oath , but theirs was not so . - Hebrews 7:23 Another argument tending to the same purpose . The Levitical Priests ( as mortal men ) could not be everlasting , but Christ as he is everlasting , so hath he also an everlasting Priesthood making most effectual intercession for them which by him come unto God . - Hebrews 7:24 Which can not pass away . - Hebrews 7:25 He is fit and meet . - Hebrews 7:26 Another argument : There are required in an high Priest innocency , and perfect pureness , which may separate him from sinners , for whom he offereth . But the Levitical high Priests shall not be found to be such , for they offer first for their own sins : But Christ only is such a one ; and therefore the true and only high Priest . - Hebrews 7:27 Another argument which notwithstanding he handleth afterward : The Levitical Priests offered sacrifice after sacrifice , first for themselves , and then for the people . But Christ offered not for himself , but for others , not sacrifices , but himself , not oftentimes , but once . And this ought not to seem strange ; saith he , forsomuch as they are weak , but this man is consecrated an everlasting Priest , and that by an oath . - Hebrews 7:27 That sacrifice which he offered . - Hebrews 7:27 It was so done , that it needeth not be repeated or offered again anymore . - Hebrews 7:28 The commandment of God which was bound with an oath . - Hebrews 7:28 Another argument taken of the time : former things are taken away by the latter . - Hebrews 7:28 Exhibited .

GNV	Hebrews	8	1	Now [ a ] of the things which we have spoken , this is the sum , that we have such an high Priest , that sitteth at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heavens ,
GNV	Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the pattern and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was warned by God when he was about to finish the Tabernacle . ( A ) See , said he , that thou make all things according to the pattern , showed to thee in the mount .
GNV	Hebrews	8	13	[ k ] In that he saith a new Testament , he hath abrogated the old : now that which is disannulled and waxed old , is ready to vanish away . Footnotes - Hebrews 8:1 He briefly repeateth that , whereunto all these things are to be referred , to wit , we have a far other high Priest than those Levitical high Priests are , even such an one as sitteth at the right hand of the most high God in heaven . - Hebrews 8:2 They of Levi were high Priests in an earthly sanctuary , but Christ is in the heavenly . - Hebrews 8:2 Of heaven . - Hebrews 8:2 They of Levi exercised their Priesthood in a frail tabernacle , but Christ beareth about with him a far other tabernacle , to wit , his body which God himself made to be everlasting , as it shall afterward be declared , Heb . 9:11 . - Hebrews 8:2 Of his body . - Hebrews 8:3 He bringeth a reason why it must needs be that Christ should have a body ( which he calleth a tabernacle which the Lord pight and not man ) to wit , that he might have what to offer : for otherwise he could not be an high Priest . And the selfsame body is both the tabernacle and the sacrifice . - Hebrews 8:4 He giveth a reason why he said that our high Priest is in the heavenly sanctuary and not in the earthly : because , saith he , if he were now on the earth , he could not minister in the earthly sanctuary , seeing there are yet Levitical Priests , which are appointed for him , that is to say , to be patterns of that perfect example . And to what purpose should the patterns serve when the true and original example is present . - Hebrews 8:6 He entereth into the comparison of the old and transitory Testament or covenant being but for a time , whereof the Levitical Priests were mediators with the new the everlasting Mediator whereof is Christ , to show that this is not only better than that in all respects , but also that that was abrogated by this . - Hebrews 8:7 He proveth by the testimony of Jeremiah , that there is a second Testament or covenant , and therefore that the first was not perfect . - Hebrews 8:8 He calleth it an house , as it were one family of the whole kingdom : for whereas the kingdom of David was divided into two factions , the Prophet giveth us to understand that through the new Testament they shall be joined together again in one . - Hebrews 8:13 The conclusion : Therefore by the latter and the new , the first and old is taken away , for it could not be called new if it differed not from the old . And again that same is at length taken away : which is subject to corruption , and therefore imperfect . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Hebrews	8	2	[ b ] And is a minister of the [ c ] Sanctuary , [ d ] and of that [ e ] true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched , and not man .
GNV	Hebrews	8	3	[ f ] For every high Priest is ordained to offer both gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it was of necessity , that this man should have somewhat also to offer .
GNV	Hebrews	8	4	[ g ] For he were not a Priest , if he were on the earth , seeing there are Priests that according to the Law offer gifts ,
GNV	Hebrews	8	6	[ h ] But now our high Priest hath obtained a more excellent office , inasmuch as he is the Mediator of a better Testament , which is established upon better promises .
GNV	Hebrews	8	7	[ i ] For if that first Testament had been unblameable , no place should have been sought for the second .
GNV	Hebrews	8	9	Not like the Testament that I made with their fathers , in the day that I took them by the hand , to lead them out of the land of Egypt : for they continued not in my Testament , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
GNV	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the Testament that I will make with the house of Israel , After those days , saith the Lord , I will put my Laws in their mind , and in their heart I will write them , and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
GNV	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbor , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least of them to the greatest of them .

GNV	Hebrews	9	2	For the first Tabernacle was made , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the showbread , which Tabernacle is called the Holy places .
GNV	Hebrews	9	10	[ k ] Which only stood in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal rites , [ l ] which were enjoined , until the time of reformation .
GNV	Hebrews	9	11	[ m ] But Christ being come an high Priest of good things to come , [ n ] by a [ o ] greater and a more perfect Tabernacle , not made with hands , that is , not of this building ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	15	[ u ] And for this cause is he the Mediator of the new Testament , that through ( H ) death which was for the redemption of the transgressions that were in the former Testament , they which were called , might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
GNV	Hebrews	9	24	[ aa ] For Christ is not entered into the holy places that are made with hands , which are similitudes of the true Sanctuary : but is entered into very heaven , to appear now in the sight of God for us ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	1	Cor . 15:51 . - Hebrews 9:28 Thus the general promise is restrained to the elect only : and we have to seek the testimony of our election : not in the secret counsel of God , but in the effects that our faith worketh , and so we must climb up from the lowest step to the highest , there to find such comfort as is most certain , and shall never be moved . - Hebrews 9:28 Shortly by the way he setteth out Christ as Judge , partly to terrify them , which do not rest themselves in the only oblation of Christ once made , and partly to keep the faithful in their duty , that they will go not back . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	3	And after the [ c ] second veil was the Tabernacle , which is called the [ d ] Holiest of all ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	4	Which had the golden censer , and the Ark of the Testament overlaid round about with gold , wherein the golden pot , which had Manna , was , and ( A ) Aaron ’ s rod that had budded , and the ( B ) tables of the Testament .
GNV	Hebrews	9	5	( C ) And over the Ark were the glorious Cherubims , shadowing the [ e ] mercy seat : of which things we will not now speak particularly .
GNV	Hebrews	9	6	[ f ] Now when these things were thus ordained , the Priest went always into the first Tabernacle , and accomplished the service .
GNV	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the ( D ) high Priest alone , once every year , not without blood which he offered for himself , and for the [ g ] ignorances of the people .
GNV	Hebrews	9	8	[ h ] Whereby the holy Ghost this signified , that the way into the Holiest of all was not yet opened , while as yet the first tabernacle was standing ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	12	[ p ] Neither by the blood of [ q ] goats and calves : but by his own blood entered he in once unto the holy place , and obtained eternal redemption for us .
GNV	Hebrews	9	13	( E ) [ r ] For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer , sprinkling them that are unclean , sanctifieth as touching the [ s ] purifying of the flesh ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the ( F ) blood of Christ which through the eternal Spirit offered himself without fault to God , ( G ) purge your conscience from [ t ] dead works , to serve the living God ?
GNV	Hebrews	9	16	[ v ] For where a Testament is , there must be the death of him that made the Testament .
GNV	Hebrews	9	17	( I ) For the Testament is confirmed when men are dead : for it is yet of no force as long as he that made it , is alive .
GNV	Hebrews	9	18	[ w ] Wherefore , neither was the first ordained without blood .
GNV	Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to the people , [ x ] according to the Law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water and purple wool and hyssop , and [ y ] sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	20	( J ) Saying , This is the blood of the Testament , which God hath appointed unto you .
GNV	Hebrews	9	21	Moreover , he sprinkled likewise the Tabernacle with blood also , and all the ministering vessels ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood , and without shedding of blood is no remission .
GNV	Hebrews	9	23	It was then necessary , that the [ z ] similitudes of heavenly things should be purified with such things : but the heavenly things themselves are purified with better sacrifices than are these .
GNV	Hebrews	9	25	[ ab ] Not that he should offer himself often , as the high Priest entered into the Holy place every year with others ’ blood ,
GNV	Hebrews	9	26	[ ac ] ( For then must he have often suffered since the foundation of the world ) but now in the [ ad ] end of the world hath he been made manifest , once to put away [ ae ] sin by the sacrifice of himself .
GNV	Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men that they shall [ af ] once die , and after that cometh the judgment :
GNV	Hebrews	9	28	So ( K ) Christ was once offered to take away the sins of [ ag ] many , [ ah ] and unto them that look for him , shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:1 A division of the first Tabernacle which he calleth worldly , that is to say , transitory and earthly into two parts , to wit , into the holy places and the Holiest of all . - Hebrews 9:1 An earthy and a flitting . - Hebrews 9:3 He calleth it the second veil , not because there were two veils , but because it was behind the Sanctuary or the first Tabernacle . - Hebrews 9:3 The holiest Sanctuary . - Hebrews 9:5 The Hebrews call the cover of the Ark of the covenant , the mercy seat , whom both the Greeks and we follow . - Hebrews 9:6 Now he cometh to the sacrifices which he divideth into those daily sacrifices , and that yearly and solemn sacrifice , with the which the high Priest only , but once every year entering into the Holiest of all with blood , offered for himself and the people . - Hebrews 9:7 For the sins . See Heb . 5:2 . - Hebrews 9:8 Of that yearly rite and ceremony he gathereth that the way was not by such sacrifices opened into heaven , which was shadowed by the Holiest of all . For why did the high Priest alone enter in thither , shutting out all other , and that to offer sacrifices there both for himself and for others , and after did shut the Holiest of all again ? - Hebrews 9:9 An objection : If the way were not opened into heaven by those sacrifices ( that is to say , If the worshippers were not purged by them ) why then were those ceremonies used ? to wit , that men might be called back to that spiritual example , that is to say , to Christ , who should correct all those things at his coming . - Hebrews 9:9 For that time that that figure had to last . - Hebrews 9:10 Another reason why they could not make clean the conscience of the worshipper , to wit , because they were outward and carnal or corporal things . - Hebrews 9:10 For they were as you would say a burden , from which Christ delivered us . - Hebrews 9:11 Now he entereth into the declaration of the figures , and first of all comparing the Levitical high Priest with Christ , ( that is to say , the figure with the thing itself ) he attributeth to Christ the administration of good things to come , that is , everlasting , which those carnal things had respect unto . - Hebrews 9:11 Another comparison of the first corruptible Tabernacle with the latter ( that is to say , with the human nature of Christ ) which is the true incorruptible Temple of God , whereinto which the Son of GOD entered , as the Levitical high Priests into the other which was frail and transitory . - Hebrews 9:11 By a more excellent and better . - Hebrews 9:12 Another comparison of the blood of sacrifices with Christ . The Levitical high Priests entering by their holy places into the Sanctuary , offered corruptible blood for one year only : but Christ entering into that holy body of his , entered by it into heaven itself , offering his own most pure blood for an everlasting redemption : For one selfsame Christ answereth both to the high Priest , and the Tabernacle , and the sacrifices , and offering themselves , as the truth to the figures , so that Christ is both the high Priest , and Tabernacle , and Sacrifice , yea , all these both truly , and forever . - Hebrews 9:12 For in this yearly sacrifice of reconciliation , there were two kinds of sacrifices , the one a goat , the other a heifer , or calf . - Hebrews 9:13 If the outward sprinkling of blood and ashes of beasts , was a true and effectual sign of purifying and cleansing , how much more shall the thing itself and the truth being present , which in times past was shadowed by those external Sacraments , that is to say , his blood which is in such sort man ’ s blood , that is also the blood of the Son of God , and therefore hath an everlasting virtue of purifying and cleansing , does it ? - Hebrews 9:13 He considereth the signs apart , being separate from the thing itself . - Hebrews 9:14 From sins which proceed from death , and bring forth nothing but death . - Hebrews 9:15 The conclusion of the former argument : therefore seeing the blood of beasts did not purge sins , the new Testament which was before time promised , whereunto those outward things had respect , is now indeed established , by the virtue whereof all transgressions might be taken away , and heaven indeed opened unto us : whereof it followeth that Christ shed his blood also for the Fathers : For he was shadowed by those old ceremonies , otherwise , unless they had served to represent him , they had been nothing at all profitable . Therefore this Testament is called the latter , not concerning the virtue of it , ( that is to say , remission of sins ) but in respect of that time , wherein the thing itself was finished , that is to say , wherein Christ was indeed exhibited to the world , and fulfilled all things which were necessary to our salvation . - Hebrews 9:16 A reason why the Testament must be established by the death of the Mediator , because this Testament hath the condition of a Testament or gift , which is made effectual by death , and therefore that it might be effectual , it must needs be that he that made the Testament , should die . - Hebrews 9:18 There must be a proportion between those things which purify , and those which are purified : Under the Law all those figures were earthly , the Tabernacle , the book , the vessels , the sacrifices , although they were the figures of heavenly things . Therefore it was requisite that all those should be purified with some matter and ceremony of the same nature , to wit , with the blood of beasts , with water , wool , hyssop . But under Christ all things are heavenly , an heavenly tabernacle , an heavenly sacrifice , an heavenly people , an heavenly doctrine , and heaven itself is set open before us for an eternal habitation . Therefore all these things are sanctified in like sort , to wit , with the everlasting offering of the quickening blood of Christ . - Hebrews 9:19 As the Lord had commanded . - Hebrews 9:19 He useth to sprinkle . - Hebrews 9:23 The similitudes of heavenly things were earthly , and therefore they were to be set forth with earthly things , as with the blood of beasts , and wool , and hyssop . But under Christ all things are heavenly , and therefore they could not but be sanctified with the offering of his lively blood . - Hebrews 9:24 Another double comparison : the Levitical high Priest entered into the Sanctuary , which was made indeed by the commandment of God , but yet with men ’ s hands , that it might be a pattern of another more excellent , to wit , of the heavenly place . But Christ entered even into heaven itself . Again , he appeared before the Ark , but Christ before God the Father himself . - Hebrews 9:25 Another double comparison : the Levitical high Priest offered other blood , but Christ offered his own : he every year once iterated his offering : Christ offering himself but once , abolished sin altogether , both of the former ages and of the ages to come . - Hebrews 9:26 An argument to prove that Christ ’ s offering ought not to be repeated : Seeing that sins were to be purged from the beginning of the world , and it is proved that sins can not be purged , but by the only blood of Christ : he must needs have died oftentimes since the beginning of the world . But a man can die but once : therefore Christ ’ s oblation which was once done in the latter days , neither could nor can be repeated . Seeing then it is so , surely the virtue of it extendeth both to sins that were before , and to sins that are after his coming . - Hebrews 9:26 In the latter days . - Hebrews 9:26 That whole root of sin . - Hebrews 9:27 He speaketh of the natural state and condition of man : For as for Lazarus and certain others that died twice , that was no usual thing but extraordinary , and for them that shall be changed , their changing is a kind of death ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	10	By the which will we are sanctified , even by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once made .

GNV	Hebrews	10	1	For [ a ] the law having the shadow of good things to [ b ] come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices , which they offer year by year continually , sanctify the comers thereunto .
GNV	Hebrews	10	2	For would they not then have ceased to have been offered , because that the offerers once purged , should have had no more conscience of sins ?
GNV	Hebrews	10	5	[ c ] Wherefore when he [ d ] cometh into the world , he saith , ( A ) Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not : but a [ e ] body hast thou ordained me .
GNV	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings , and sin offerings thou hast had no pleasure .
GNV	Hebrews	10	19	[ m ] Seeing therefore , brethren , that by the blood of Jesus we may be bold to enter into the Holy place ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be worthy , which treadeth under foot the Son of God , and counteth the blood of the Testament as an unholy thing , wherewith he was sanctified , and doeth despite the Spirit of grace ?
GNV	Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience , that after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
GNV	Hebrews	10	38	( H ) [ ad ] Now the just shall live by faith : but if any withdraw himself , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
GNV	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again of sins every year .
GNV	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins .
GNV	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , Lo , I come ( in the beginning of the book it is written of me ) that I should do thy will , O God .
GNV	Hebrews	10	8	Above , when he said , Sacrifice and offering , and burnt offerings , and sin offerings , thou wouldest not have , neither hadst pleasure therein ( which are offered by the Law . )
GNV	Hebrews	10	9	Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God , he taketh away the [ f ] first , that he may stablish the second .
GNV	Hebrews	10	11	[ g ] And every Priest [ h ] standeth daily ministering , and ofttimes offereth one manner of offering , which can never take away sins :
GNV	Hebrews	10	12	But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins , ( B ) sitteth forever at the right hand of God ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	13	[ i ] And from henceforth tarrieth , ( C ) till his enemies be made his footstool .
GNV	Hebrews	10	14	For with one offering hath he consecrated forever them that are sanctified .
GNV	Hebrews	10	15	[ j ] For the holy Ghost also beareth us record : for after that he had said before ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	16	( D ) This is the Testament that I will make unto them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my Laws in their heart , and in their minds I will write them .
GNV	Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember [ k ] no more .
GNV	Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these things is , there is no more offering for [ l ] sin .
GNV	Hebrews	10	20	By the new and living way , which he hath prepared for us , through the veil , that is , his [ n ] flesh :
GNV	Hebrews	10	21	And seeing we have an high Priest , which is over the house of God ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	22	[ o ] Let us draw near with a [ p ] true heart in assurance of faith , our [ q ] hearts being pure from an evil conscience ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	23	And washed in our bodies with [ r ] pure water , let us keep the profession of our hope , without wavering , ( for he is faithful that promised . )
GNV	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another , to provoke unto love , and to good works ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking the fellowship that we have among ourselves , as the manner of some is : but let us exhort one another , [ s ] and that so much the more , because ye see that the day draweth near .
GNV	Hebrews	10	26	( E ) For if we sin [ t ] willingly after that we have received and acknowledged that truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	27	But a fearful looking for of judgment , and violent fire , which shall devour the [ u ] adversaries .
GNV	Hebrews	10	28	[ v ] He that despiseth Moses ’ Law , dieth without mercy ( F ) under two , or three witnesses :
GNV	Hebrews	10	30	[ w ] For we know him that hath said , ( G ) Vengeance belongeth unto me : I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall [ x ] judge his people .
GNV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
GNV	Hebrews	10	32	[ y ] Now call to remembrance the days that are passed , in the which , after ye had received light ye endured a great fight in afflictions ,
GNV	Hebrews	10	33	Partly while ye were made a [ z ] gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions , and partly while ye became [ aa ] companions of them which were so tossed to and fro .
GNV	Hebrews	10	34	For both ye sorrowed with me for my bonds , and suffered with joy the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves how that ye have in heaven a better , and an enduring [ ab ] substance .
GNV	Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward .
GNV	Hebrews	10	37	For yet a very [ ac ] little while , and he that shall come , will come , and will not tarry .
GNV	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not they which withdraw ourselves unto perdition , but follow faith unto the conservation of the soul . Footnotes - Hebrews 10:1 He preventeth a privy objection . Why then were those sacrifices offered ? The Apostle answereth first touching that yearly sacrifice which was the solemnest of all , wherein ( saith he ) there was made every year a remembrance again of all former sins . Therefore that sacrifice had no power to sanctify : for to what purpose should those sins which are purged be repeated again , and wherefore should new sins come to be repeated every year , if those sacrifices did abolish sin ? - Hebrews 10:1 Of things which are everlasting , which were promised to the Fathers , and exhibited in Christ . - Hebrews 10:5 A conclusion following of those things that went before , and comprehending also the other sacrifices . Seeing that the sacrifices of the Law could not do it , therefore Christ speaking of himself as of our high Priest manifested in the flesh , witnesseseth evidently that God resteth not in the sacrifices , but in the obedience of his Son our high Priest , in which obedience he offered up himself once to his Father for us . - Hebrews 10:5 The Son of God is said to come into the world , when he was made man . - Hebrews 10:5 It is word for word in the Hebrew text , Thou hast pierced mine ears through , that is , thou hast made me obedient , and willing to hear . - Hebrews 10:9 That is the sacrifices , to establish the second , that is , the will of God . - Hebrews 10:11 A conclusion , with the other part of the comparison . The Levitical high Priest repeateth the same sacrifices daily in his sanctuary : whereupon which it followeth that neither those sacrifices , neither those offerings , neither those high Priests could take away sins . But Christ , having offered one sacrifice once for the sins of all men , and having sanctified his own forever , sitteth at the right hand of the Father , having all power in his hands . - Hebrews 10:11 At the altar . - Hebrews 10:13 He preventeth a privy objection , to wit , that yet notwithstanding we are subject to sin and death , whereunto the Apostle answereth , that the full efficacy of Christ ’ s virtue hath not yet showed itself , but shall at length appear when he will at once put to flight all his enemies , with whom as yet we strive . - Hebrews 10:15 Although there do yet remain in us relics of sin , yet the work of our sanctification which is to be perfected , hangeth upon the selfsame sacrifice which never shall be repeated : and that the Apostle proveth by alledging again the testimonies of Jeremiah , thus , Sin is taken away by the new Testament , seeing the Lord saith that it shall come to pass , that according to the form of it , he will no more remember our sins : Therefore we need now no purging sacrifice to take away that which is already taken away , but we must rather take pains , that we may now through faith be partakers of that sacrifice . - Hebrews 10:17 Why then , where is the fire of Purgatory , and that Popish distinction of the fault and the punishment ? - Hebrews 10:18 He said well , for sin : for there remaineth another offering , to wit , of thanksgiving . - Hebrews 10:19 The sum of the former treatise : We are not shut out now of the holy place , as the Fathers were , but we have an entrance into the true holy place ( that is , into heaven ) seeing that we are purged with the blood not of beasts , but of Jesus . Neither as in times past , doth the high Priest shut us out by setting the veil against us , but through the veil , which is his flesh , he hath brought us into heaven itself , being present with us , so that we have now truly an high Priest , which is over the house of God . - Hebrews 10:20 So Christ ’ s flesh showeth us the Godhead as it were under a veil , for otherwise we were not able to abide the brightness of it . - Hebrews 10:22 A most grave exhortation , wherein which he showeth how that sacrifice of Christ may be applied to us : to wit , by faith , which also he describeth , by the consequence , to wit , by sanctification of the Spirit , which causeth us surely to hope in God , and to procure by all means possible one another ’ s salvation , through the love that is in us one toward another . - Hebrews 10:22 With no double and counterfeit heart , but with such an heart as is truly and indeed given to God . - Hebrews 10:22 This is it which the Lord saith , Be ye holy , for I am holy . - Hebrews 10:23 With the grace of the holy Ghost . - Hebrews 10:25 Having mentioned the last coming of Christ , he stirreth up the godly to the meditation of an holy life , and cites the faithless fallers from God , to the fearful judgment seat of the judge , because they wickedly rejected him in whom only salvation consisteth . - Hebrews 10:26 Without any cause or occasion , or show of occasion . - Hebrews 10:27 For it is another matter to sin through the frailty of man ’ s nature , and another thing to proclaim war as it were to God as to an enemy . - Hebrews 10:28 If the breach of the Law of Moses was punished by death , how much more worthy death is it to fall away from Christ ? - Hebrews 10:30 The reason of all these things is , because God is a revenger of such as despise him : otherwise he should not rightly govern his Church . Now there is nothing more horrible then the wrath of the living God . - Hebrews 10:30 Rule or govern . - Hebrews 10:32 As he terrified the fallers away from God so doth he now comfort them that are constant and stand strongly setting before them the success of their former fights , so stirring them up to a sure hope of a full and ready victory . - Hebrews 10:33 You were brought forth to be ashamed . - Hebrews 10:33 In taking their miseries , to be your miseries . - Hebrews 10:34 Goods and riches . - Hebrews 10:37 He will come within this very little while . - Hebrews 10:38 He commendeth the excellency of a sure faith by the effect , because it is the only way to life , which sentence he setteth forth and amplifieth by setting the contrary against it .

GNV	Hebrews	11	1	Now [ a ] faith is the grounds of things which are hoped for , and the evidence of things which are not seen .
GNV	Hebrews	11	2	[ b ] For by it our [ c ] elders were well reported of .
GNV	Hebrews	11	3	( A ) [ d ] Through faith we understand that the world was ordained by the word of God , so that the things which we [ e ] see , are not made of things which did appear .
GNV	Hebrews	11	4	[ f ] By faith Abel ( B ) offered unto God a greater sacrifice than Cain , by ( C ) the which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : by the which faith also he being dead , yet speaketh .
GNV	Hebrews	11	5	[ g ] By faith was ( D ) Enoch translated , that he should not [ h ] see death : neither was he found : for God had translated him : for before he was translated , he was reported of , that he had pleased God .
GNV	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God , must believe that God is , and that he is a [ i ] rewarder of them that seek him .
GNV	Hebrews	11	7	[ j ] By faith ( E ) Noah being warned of God of the things which were as yet not seen , moved with reverence , prepared the Ark to the saving of his household , through the which Ark he condemned the world , and was made heir of the righteousness , which is by faith .
GNV	Hebrews	11	8	[ k ] By faith ( F ) Abraham , when he was called , obeyed God , to go out into a place , which he should afterward receive for inheritance , and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
GNV	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he abode in the land of promise , as in a strange country , as one that dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob heirs with him of the same promise .
GNV	Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city having a [ l ] foundation , whose builder and maker is God .
GNV	Hebrews	11	12	And therefore sprang thereof one , even of one which was [ m ] dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand of the sea shore which is innumerable .
GNV	Hebrews	11	13	All these died in [ n ] faith , and received not the [ o ] promises , but saw them afar off , and believed them , and [ p ] received them thankfully , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
GNV	Hebrews	11	14	For they that say such things , declare plainly , that they seek a country .
GNV	Hebrews	11	15	And if they had been mindful of that country , from whence they came out , they had leisure to have returned .
GNV	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better , that is an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
GNV	Hebrews	11	17	By faith ( H ) Abraham offered up Isaac , when he was [ q ] tried , and he that had received the [ r ] promises , offered his only begotten son .
GNV	Hebrews	11	18	( To whom it was said , ( I ) In Isaac shall thy seed be called . )
GNV	Hebrews	11	19	For he considered that God was able to raise him up even from the dead : from [ s ] whence he received him also after [ t ] a sort .
GNV	Hebrews	11	20	[ u ] By faith ( J ) Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , concerning things to come .
GNV	Hebrews	11	21	[ v ] By faith ( K ) Jacob when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph , and ( L ) leaning on the end of his staff , worshipped God .
GNV	Hebrews	11	22	[ w ] By faith ( M ) Joseph when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel , and gave commandment of his bones .
GNV	Hebrews	11	23	( N ) [ x ] By faith Moses when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child , neither [ y ] feared they the king ’ s ( O ) commandment .
GNV	Hebrews	11	24	By faith ( P ) Moses when he was come to age , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
GNV	Hebrews	11	25	And chose rather to suffer adversity with the people of God , than to enjoy the [ z ] pleasures of sin for a season ,
GNV	Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the rebuke of Christ greater riches , than the treasures of Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward .
GNV	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt , and feared not the fierceness of the king : for he endured , as he that saw him which is invisible .
GNV	Hebrews	11	28	Through faith he ordained the ( Q ) Passover and the effusion of blood , lest he that destroyed the first born , should touch them .
GNV	Hebrews	11	29	[ aa ] By faith they ( R ) passed through the red sea as by dry land , which when the Egyptians had assayed to do , they were swallowed up .
GNV	Hebrews	11	30	[ ab ] By faith the ( S ) walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days .
GNV	Hebrews	11	31	[ ac ] By faith the [ ad ] harlot ( T ) Rahab perished not with them which obeyed not , when ( U ) she had received the spies [ ae ] peaceably .
GNV	Hebrews	11	32	[ af ] And what shall I more say ? for the time would be too short for me to tell of ( V ) Gideon , of ( W ) Barak , and of ( X ) Samson , and of ( Y ) Jephthah , also of David , and Samuel , and of the Prophets :
GNV	Hebrews	11	33	Which through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained the [ ag ] promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
GNV	Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , of weak were made strong , waxed valiant in battle , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
GNV	Hebrews	11	35	The [ ah ] women received their dead raised to life : others also were [ ai ] racked , and would not be delivered , that they might receive a better resurrection .
GNV	Hebrews	11	36	And others have been tried by mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover by bonds , and imprisonment .
GNV	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , they were hewn asunder , they were tempted , they were slain with the sword , they wandered up and down in [ aj ] sheep ’ s skins , and in goats ’ skins , being destitute , afflicted , and tormented :
GNV	Hebrews	11	38	Whom the world was not worthy of : they wandered in wildernesses and mountains , and dens , and caves of the earth .
GNV	Hebrews	11	39	[ ak ] And these all through faith obtained good report , and received [ al ] not the promise ,
GNV	Hebrews	11	40	God providing a better thing for us , that they [ am ] without us should not be made perfect . Footnotes - Hebrews 11:1 An excellent description of faith by the effects , because it representeth things which are but yet in hope , and setteth as it were before our eyes things that are invisible . - Hebrews 11:2 He showeth that the Fathers ought to be accounted of , by this virtue . - Hebrews 11:2 That is , those Fathers of whom we came : and whose authority and example ought to move us very much . - Hebrews 11:3 He showeth the propriety of faith , by setting unto us most piked examples of such as from the beginning of the world excelled in the Church . - Hebrews 11:3 So that the world which we see , was not made of any matter that appeared or was before , but of nothing . - Hebrews 11:4 Abel . - Hebrews 11:5 Enoch . - Hebrews 11:5 That he should not die . - Hebrews 11:6 This reward is not referred to our merits , but to the free promise , as Paul teacheth in Abraham the father of all the faithful , Rom . 4:4 . - Hebrews 11:7 Noah . - Hebrews 11:8 Abraham and Sarah . - Hebrews 11:10 This foundation is set against their tabernacle . - Hebrews 11:12 As unlikely to bear children , as if she had been stark dead . - Hebrews 11:13 In faith , which they had while they lived , and followed them even to their grave . - Hebrews 11:13 This is the figure Metonymy , for the things promised . - Hebrews 11:13 For the Patriarchs were wont when they received the promises , to profess their religion , by building of altars , and calling on the name of the Lord . - Hebrews 11:17 Tried of the Lord . - Hebrews 11:17 Although the promises of life were made in that only begotten Son Isaac , yet he appointed him to die , and so against hope he believed in hope . - Hebrews 11:19 From which death . - Hebrews 11:19 For there was not the true and very death of Isaac , but as it were the death , by means whereof he seemed also as it were to have risen again . - Hebrews 11:20 Isaac . - Hebrews 11:21 Jacob . - Hebrews 11:22 Joseph . - Hebrews 11:23 Moses . - Hebrews 11:23 They were not afraid to bring him up . - Hebrews 11:25 Such pleasures as he could not enjoy , but he must needs provoke God ’ s wrath against him . - Hebrews 11:29 The red sea . - Hebrews 11:30 Jericho . - Hebrews 11:31 Rahab . - Hebrews 11:31 A notable example of God ’ s goodness . - Hebrews 11:31 Courteously and friendly , so that she did not only not hurt them , but also kept them safe . - Hebrews 11:32 Gideon , Barak and other Judges and Prophets . - Hebrews 11:33 The fruit of the promises . - Hebrews 11:35 He seemeth to mean the story of that woman of Zarephath , whose son Elijah raised again from death , and the Shunammite , whose son Elisha restored to his mother . - Hebrews 11:35 He meaneth that persecution which Antiochus wrought . - Hebrews 11:37 In vile and rough clothing , so were the saints brought to extreme poverty , and constrained to live like beasts in wildernesses . - Hebrews 11:39 An amplification taken of the circumstance of the time : their faith is so much the more to be marveled at , by how much the promises of things to come were more dark , yet at length were indeed exhibited to us , so that their faith and ours is as one , as is also their consecration and ours . - Hebrews 11:39 But saw Christ afar off . - Hebrews 11:40 For their salvation did hang upon Christ , who was exhibited in our days .

GNV	Hebrews	12	1	Wherefore , ( A ) [ a ] let us also , seeing that we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses , cast away everything that presseth down , and the sin that [ b ] hangeth so fast on : let us run with patience the race that is set before us ,
GNV	Hebrews	12	3	[ f ] Consider therefore him that endureth such speaking against of sinners , lest ye should be wearied and faint in your minds .
GNV	Hebrews	12	11	Now no chastising for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : but afterward , it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousness , unto them which are thereby exercised .
GNV	Hebrews	12	2	[ c ] [ d ] Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith , who for the [ e ] joy that was set before him , endured the cross , and despised the shame , and is set at the right hand of the throne of God .
GNV	Hebrews	12	4	[ g ] Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
GNV	Hebrews	12	5	[ h ] And ye have forgotten the consolation , which speaketh unto you as unto children , ( B ) My son , despise not the chastening of the Lord , neither faint when thou art rebuked of him .
GNV	Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth , he chasteneth : and he scourgeth every son that he receiveth .
GNV	Hebrews	12	7	If ye endure chastening , God offered himself unto you as unto sons : for what son is it whom the father chasteneth not ?
GNV	Hebrews	12	8	If therefore ye be without correction , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
GNV	Hebrews	12	9	[ i ] Moreover we have had the fathers of our bodies which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : should we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits , that we might live ?
GNV	Hebrews	12	10	[ j ] For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure , but he chastened us for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
GNV	Hebrews	12	13	And make [ m ] straight steps unto your feet , lest that which is halting , be turned out of the way , but let it rather be healed .
GNV	Hebrews	12	14	( C ) [ n ] Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without the which no man shall see the Lord .
GNV	Hebrews	12	15	[ o ] Take heed , that no man fall away from the grace of God : let no [ p ] root of bitterness spring up and trouble you , lest thereby many be defiled .
GNV	Hebrews	12	16	[ q ] Let there be no fornicator , or profane person as ( D ) Esau , which for one portion of meat sold his birthright .
GNV	Hebrews	12	17	( E ) For ye know how that afterward also when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no [ r ] place to repentance , though he sought that blessing with tears .
GNV	Hebrews	12	18	[ s ] For ye are not come unto the ( F ) mount that might be [ t ] touched , nor unto burning fire , nor to blackness and darkness , and tempest ,
GNV	Hebrews	12	19	Neither unto the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words , which they that heard it , excused themselves , ( G ) that the word should not be spoken to them any more .
GNV	Hebrews	12	20	( For they were not able to abide that which was commanded , ( H ) yea , though a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
GNV	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the [ u ] sight which appeared , that Moses said , I fear and quake . )
GNV	Hebrews	12	22	But ye are come unto the mount Sion , and to the city of the living God , the celestial Jerusalem , and to the company of innumerable Angels .
GNV	Hebrews	12	23	And to the assembly and congregation of the first born , which are written in heaven , and to God the judge of all , and to the spirits of just and [ v ] perfect men ,
GNV	Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus the Mediator of the new Testament , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
GNV	Hebrews	12	25	[ w ] See that ye despise not him that speaketh : for if they escaped not which refused him , that spake on earth : much more shall we not escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven .
GNV	Hebrews	12	26	[ x ] Whose voice then shook the earth , and now hath declared , saying , ( I ) Yet [ y ] once more will I shake , not the earth only , but also heaven .
GNV	Hebrews	12	27	And this word , Yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things which are shaken , as of things which are made with hands , that the things which are not shaken , may remain .
GNV	Hebrews	12	28	[ z ] Wherefore seeing we receive a kingdom , which can not be shaken , let us have grace whereby we may so serve God , that we may please him with [ aa ] reverence and [ ab ] fear .
GNV	Hebrews	12	29	For ( J ) even our God is a consuming fire . Footnotes - Hebrews 12:1 An applying of the former examples , whereby we ought to be stirred up to run the whole race , casting away all stops and impediments . - Hebrews 12:1 For sin besiegeth us on all sides , so that we can not escape out . - Hebrews 12:2 He setteth before us , as the mark of this race , Jesus himself our captain , who willingly overcame all the roughness of the same way . - Hebrews 12:2 As it were upon the mark of our faith . - Hebrews 12:2 Whereas he had all kind of blessedness in his hand and power , yet suffered willingly the ignominy of the cross . - Hebrews 12:3 An amplification taken of the circumstance of the person , and the things themselves , which he compareth betwixt themselves : for how great is Jesus in comparison of us , and how far more grievous things did he suffer than we ? - Hebrews 12:4 He taketh an argument of the profit which cometh to us by God ’ s chastisements , unless we be in fault . First of all because sin , or that rebellious wickedness of our flesh , is by this means turned . - Hebrews 12:5 Secondly , because they are testimony of his fatherly good will toward us , insomuch that they show themselves to be bastards , which can not abide to be chastened of God . - Hebrews 12:9 Thirdly , if all men yield this right to fathers , to whom next after God we owe this life , that they may rightfully correct their children , shall we not be much more subject to that our Father , who is the Author of the spiritual and everlasting life ? - Hebrews 12:10 An amplification of the same argument : Those fathers have corrected us after their fancy , for some frail and transitory profit : but God chasteneth and instructeth us for our singular profit , to make us partakers of his holiness : which thing although these our senses do not presently perceive , yet the end of the matter proveth it . - Hebrews 12:12 The conclusion , we must go forward courageously and keep always a right course , and ( as far forth as we may ) without any staggering or stumbling . - Hebrews 12:12 The description of a man that is out of heart and clean discouraged . - Hebrews 12:13 Keep a right course , and so , that you show example of good life for others to follow . - Hebrews 12:14 We must live in peace , and holiness with all men . - Hebrews 12:15 We must study to edify one another , both in doctrine and example of life . - Hebrews 12:15 That no heresy , or backsliding be an offense . - Hebrews 12:16 We must eschew fornication , and a profane mind , that is , such a mind , as giveth not to God his due honor , which wickedness how severely God will at length punish , the horrible example of Esau teacheth us . - Hebrews 12:17 There was no place left for his repentance : and it appeareth by the effects , what his repentance was , for when he was gone out of his father ’ s sight , he threatened his brother to kill him . - Hebrews 12:18 Now he applieth the same exhortation , to the Prophetical and kingly office of Christ compared with Moses , after this sort , If the majesty of the Law was so great , how great think you that the glory of Christ and the Gospel is ? And this comparison he declareth also particularly . - Hebrews 12:18 Which might be touched with hands , which was of a gross and earthly matter . - Hebrews 12:21 The shape and form which he saw , which was no counterfeit and forged shape , but a true one . - Hebrews 12:23 So he calleth them that are taken up into heaven , although one part of them sleep in the earth . - Hebrews 12:25 The applying of the former comparison , If it were not lawful to contemn his word which spake on the earth , how much less his voice which is from heaven ? - Hebrews 12:26 He compareth the steadfast majesty of the Gospel , wherewith the whole world was shaken , and even the very frame of heaven was as it were astonished , with the small and vanishing sound of the governance by the Law . - Hebrews 12:26 It appeareth evidently in this that the Prophet speaketh of the calling of the Gentiles , that these words must be referred to the kingdom of Christ . - Hebrews 12:28 A general exhortation to live reverently and religiously under the most happy subjection of so mighty a king , who as he blesseth his most mightily , so doth he most severely revenge the rebellious . And this is the sum of a Christian life , respecting the first table . - Hebrews 12:28 By reverence is meant that honest shamefastness which keepeth them in their duties . - Hebrews 12:28 Religious and godly fear .

GNV	Hebrews	13	1	Let ( A ) [ a ] brotherly love continue .
GNV	Hebrews	13	7	So that we may boldly say , ( E ) The Lord is mine helper , neither will I fear what [ f ] man can do unto me .
GNV	Hebrews	13	2	( B ) Be not forgetful to entertain strangers : for thereby some have ( C ) received Angels into their houses unawares .
GNV	Hebrews	13	3	Remember them that are in bonds , as though ye were bound with them : and them that are in affliction , as [ b ] if ye were also afflicted in the body .
GNV	Hebrews	13	4	[ c ] Marriage is honorable among all , and the bed undefiled : but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge .
GNV	Hebrews	13	5	[ d ] Let your conversation be without covetousness , and be content with those things that ye have , for [ e ] he hath said ,
GNV	Hebrews	13	6	( D ) I will not fail thee , neither forsake thee :
GNV	Hebrews	13	8	[ g ] Remember them which have the oversight of you , which have declared unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering what hath been the end of their conversation . [ h ] Jesus Christ yesterday , and today , the same also is forever .
GNV	Hebrews	13	9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines : [ i ] for it is a good thing that the heart be stablished with grace , and not with [ j ] meats , which have not profited them that have been [ k ] occupied therein .
GNV	Hebrews	13	10	[ l ] We have an [ m ] altar , whereof they have no authority to eat , which [ n ] serve in the Tabernacle .
GNV	Hebrews	13	11	( F ) For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high Priest for sin , are burnt without the camp .
GNV	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore even Jesus , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
GNV	Hebrews	13	14	( G ) For here have we no continuing city : but we seek one to come .
GNV	Hebrews	13	15	[ p ] Let us therefore by him offer the sacrifice of praise always to God , that is , the ( H ) fruit of the lips , which confess his Name .
GNV	Hebrews	13	16	To do good , and to distribute forget not : for with such sacrifices God is pleased .
GNV	Hebrews	13	17	[ q ] Obey them that have the oversight of you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give accounts , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
GNV	Hebrews	13	18	[ r ] Pray for us , for we are assured that we have a good conscience in all things , desiring to live honestly .
GNV	Hebrews	13	19	And I desire you somewhat the more earnestly , that ye so do , that I may be restored to you more quickly .
GNV	Hebrews	13	20	The God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , the great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting Covenant ,
GNV	Hebrews	13	21	Make you [ s ] perfect in all good works , to do his will , [ t ] working in you that which is pleasant in his sight through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise forever and ever , Amen .
GNV	Hebrews	13	22	I beseech you also , brethren , suffer the words of exhortation : for I have written unto you in few words .
GNV	Hebrews	13	23	Know that our brother Timothy is delivered , with whom ( if he come shortly ) I will see you .
GNV	Hebrews	13	24	Salute all them that have the oversight of you , and all the Saints . They of Italy salute you .
GNV	Hebrews	13	25	Grace be with you all , Amen . ¶ Written to the Hebrews from Italy , and sent by Timothy . Footnotes - Hebrews 13:1 He cometh to the second table , the sum whereof is charity , especially toward strangers and such as are afflicted . - Hebrews 13:3 Be so much touched , as if their misery were yours . - Hebrews 13:4 He commendeth chaste matrimony in all sorts of men , and threateneth utter destruction from God , against whoremongers and adulterers . - Hebrews 13:5 Covetousness is condemned , against which is set a contented mind with that which the Lord hath given . - Hebrews 13:5 Even the Lord himself . - Hebrews 13:7 He setteth man against God . - Hebrews 13:8 We have to set before us the examples of valiant Captains , whom we ought diligently to follow . - Hebrews 13:8 He repeateth the sum of the doctrine , to wit , the only ground of all precepts of manners , and that is this : That we ought to quiet and content ourselves in Christ only : for there was yet never any man saved without the knowledge of him , neither is at this day saved , neither shall be saved hereafter . - Hebrews 13:9 He toucheth them which mixed an external worship , and especially the difference of meats , with the Gospel , which doctrine he plainly condemneth as clean repugnant to the benefit of Christ . - Hebrews 13:9 By this one kind which concerneth the difference of clean and unclean meats , we have to understand all the ceremonial worship . - Hebrews 13:9 Which observed the difference of them superstitiously . - Hebrews 13:10 He refuteth their error by an apt and fit comparison . They which in times past served the Tabernacle , did not eat of the sacrifices whose blood was brought for sin into the holy place by the high Priest . Moreover these sacrifices did represent Christ our offering . Therefore they can not be partakers of him which serve the Tabernacle , that is , such as stand in the service of the Law : but let not us be ashamed to follow him out of Jerusalem , from whence he was cast out and suffered : for in this also Christ , who is the truth , answereth that figure , in that he suffered without the gate . - Hebrews 13:10 By the Altar , he meaneth the offering . - Hebrews 13:10 Whereof they can not be partakers which stubbornly retain the rites of the Law . - Hebrews 13:13 He goeth on further in this comparison , and showeth that this also signified unto us , that the godly followers of Christ must as it were go out of the world , bearing his cross . - Hebrews 13:15 Now that those corporal sacrifices are taken away , he teacheth us that the true sacrifices of confession remain , which consist partly in giving of thanks , and partly in liberality , with which sacrifices indeed God is now delighted . - Hebrews 13:17 We must obey the warnings and admonitions of our Ministers and Elders , which watch for the salvation of the souls which are committed unto them . - Hebrews 13:18 The last part of this Epistle , wherein he commendeth his ministry to the Hebrews , and wisheth them continuance and increase of graces from the Lord : and excuseth himself in that he hath used but few words to comfort them , having spent the Epistle in disputing : and saluteth certain brethren familiarly and friendly . - Hebrews 13:21 Make you fit or meet . - Hebrews 13:21 Hence cometh that saying of the Fathers , that God crowneth his works in us .

GNV	James	1	4	[ h ] And let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , lacking nothing .
GNV	James	1	6	( B ) But let him ask in faith , and [ k ] waver not : [ l ] for he that wavereth , is like a wave of the sea , tossed of the wind , and carried away .
GNV	James	1	10	[ p ] Again , he that is [ q ] rich , in that he is made low : [ r ] for as the flower of the grass , shall he ( C ) vanish away .
GNV	James	1	13	[ v ] Let no man say when he is [ w ] tempted , I am tempted of God : [ x ] for God can not be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man .
GNV	James	1	17	Every good giving and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the [ aa ] Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither [ ab ] shadow of turning .
GNV	James	1	21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness , and superfluity of maliciousness , and receive with [ ag ] meekness the word that is grafted in you , which is able to save your souls .
GNV	James	1	2	[ c ] My brethren , [ d ] count it exceeding joy , [ e ] when ye fall into divers tentations ,
GNV	James	1	3	( A ) [ f ] Knowing that the [ g ] trying of your faith bringeth forth patience ,
GNV	James	1	5	[ i ] If any of you lack [ j ] wisdom , let him ask of God , which giveth to all men liberally , and reproacheth no man , and it shall be given him .
GNV	James	1	7	Neither let that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord .
GNV	James	1	8	A double minded man is unstable in [ m ] all his ways .
GNV	James	1	9	[ n ] Let the brother of [ o ] low degree rejoice in that he is exalted :
GNV	James	1	11	For as when the sun riseth with heat , then the grass withereth , and his flower falleth away , and the goodly shape of it perisheth : even so shall the rich man wither away in all his [ s ] ways .
GNV	James	1	12	[ t ] ( D ) Blessed is the man , that endureth [ u ] tentation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
GNV	James	1	14	But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away by his own concupiscence , and is enticed .
GNV	James	1	15	Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth [ y ] sin , and sin when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
GNV	James	1	16	[ z ] Err not my dear brethren .
GNV	James	1	18	[ ac ] Of his own [ ad ] will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be as the [ ae ] firstfruits of his creatures .
GNV	James	1	19	Wherefore my dear brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , and slow to wrath .
GNV	James	1	20	For the wrath of man doth not accomplish the [ af ] righteousness of God .
GNV	James	1	22	( E ) [ ah ] And be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , [ ai ] deceiving your own selves .
GNV	James	1	23	[ aj ] For if any hear the word , and do it not , he is like unto a man , that beholdeth his [ ak ] natural face in a glass .
GNV	James	1	24	For when he hath considered himself , he goeth his way , and forgetteth immediately what manner of one he was .
GNV	James	1	25	But who so looketh in the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he not being a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , shall be blessed in his [ al ] deed .
GNV	James	1	26	[ am ] If any man among you seem religious , and refraineth not his tongue , but deceiveth his [ an ] own heart , this man ’ s religion is vain .
GNV	James	1	27	[ ao ] Pure religion and undefiled before God , even the Father , is this , to [ ap ] visit the fatherless , and widows in their adversity , and to keep himself unspotted of the world . Footnotes - James 1:1 That is , written to no one man , city or country , but to all the Jews generally , being now dispersed . - James 1:1 To all the believing Jews , of what Tribe soever they be , and are dispersed through the whole world . - James 1:2 The first place or part touching comfort in afflictions , wherein we ought not be cast down and be fainthearted , but rather rejoice and be glad . - James 1:2 Seeing their condition was miserable in that scattering abroad , he doth well to begin as he doth . - James 1:2 The first argument , because our faith is tried through afflictions : which ought to be most pure , for so it is behoovable for us . - James 1:3 The second , Because patience , far passing and most excellent virtue , is by this means engendered in us . - James 1:3 That wherewith your faith is tried , to wit , those manifold temptations . - James 1:4 The third argument propounded in manner of an exhortation , that true and continual patience may be discerned from fained and for a time . The cross is as it were the instrument wherewith God doth polish and [ re ] fine us . Therefore the work and effect of afflictions , is the perfecting of us in Christ . - James 1:5 An answer to a privy objection : It is easily said , but it is not so easily done . He answereth that we need in this case a far other manner of wisdom , than the wisdom of man , to judge those things best for us , which are most contrary to the flesh : but yet we shall easily obtain this gift of wisdom , if we ask it rightly , that is , with a sure confidence of God , who is most bountiful and liberal . - James 1:5 By wisdom he meaneth the knowledge of that doctrine whereof mention was made before , to wit , wherefore we are afflicted of God , and what fruit we have to reap of affliction . - James 1:6 Why then what need other Mediator ? - James 1:6 A digression or going aside from his matter , against prayers which are conceived with a doubting mind , whereas we have a certain promise of God , and this is that second part of the Epistle . - James 1:8 In all his thoughts and his deeds . - James 1:9 He returneth to his purpose , repeating the proposition , which is , that we must rejoice in the cross , for it doth not press us down , but exalt us . - James 1:9 Who is afflicted with poverty , or contempt , or with any kind of calamity . - James 1:10 Before he concludeth , he giveth a doctrine contrary to the former : to wit , how we ought to use prosperity , which is plenty of all things : to wit , so that no man therefore please himself , but be so much the more void of pride . - James 1:10 Who hath all things at his will . - James 1:10 An argument taken of the very nature of the things themselves , for that they are most vain and uncertain . - James 1:11 Whatsoever he either purposeth in his mind , or doeth . - James 1:12 The conclusion : Therefore we must patiently bear the cross : and he addeth a fourth argument , which comprehendeth the sum of all the former , to wit , because we come by this way to the crown of life , but yet of grace according to the promise . - James 1:12 Affliction whereby the Lord trieth him . - James 1:13 The third part of this Epistle , wherein he descendeth from outward tentations , that is , from afflictions , whereby God trieth us , to inward , that is , to those lusts whereby we are stirred up to do evil . The sum is this : Every man is the author of these temptations to himself , and not God : for we bear about in our bosoms that wicked corruption , which taketh occasions by what means soever , to stir up evil motions in us , whence out at length proceed wicked doing , and in conclusion followeth death the just reward of them . - James 1:13 When he is provoked to do evil . - James 1:13 Here is a reason showed , why God can not be the author of evil doing in us , because he desireth not evil . - James 1:15 By sin is meant in this place actual sin . - James 1:16 Another reason taken of contraries : God is the author of all goodness , and so , that he is always like himself ; how then can he be thought to be author of evil ? - James 1:17 From him who is the fountain and author of all goodness . - James 1:17 He goeth on in the metaphor : for the sun by his manifold and sundry kinds of turning , maketh hours , days , months , years , light and darkness . - James 1:18 The fourth part concerning the excellency and fruit of the word of God . The sum is this : we must hear the word of God most carefully and diligently , seeing it is the seed , wherewith God of his free favor and love hath begotten us unto himself , picking us out of the number of his creatures . And the Apostle condemneth two faults , which do greatly trouble us in this matter , to wit , for that we so please ourselves , that we had rather speak ourselves than hear God speaking : yea , we snuff and are angry when we are reprehended : against which faults , he setteth a peaceable and quiet mind , and such an one as is desirous of purity . - James 1:18 This is it which Paul calleth gracious favor , and good will , which is the fountain of our salvation . - James 1:18 As it were an holy kind of offering , taken out of the residue of man . - James 1:20 That which God appointeth . - James 1:21 By meekness , he meaneth modesty , and whatsoever is contrary to an haughty and proud stomach . - James 1:22 Another admonition . Therefore is God ’ s word heard , that we may frame our lives according to the prescript thereof . - James 1:22 He addeth reasons , and those most weighty : first , because they that do otherwise , do very much hurt themselves . - James 1:23 Secondly , because they lose the chiefest use of God ’ s word , which correct not by it the faults that they know . - James 1:23 He alludeth to that natural spot , to which is contrary that purity whereunto we are born again , the lively image whereof we behold in the Law . - James 1:25 Behaving himself so : for works do show faith . - James 1:26 The third admonition : The word of God prescribeth a rule not only to do well , but also to speak well . - James 1:26 The fountain of all brabbling , and cursed speaking , and sauciness , is this , that men know not themselves . - James 1:27 The fourth : the true service of God standeth in charity toward our neighbors ( especially such as need others ’ help , as the fatherless and widows ) , and purity of life . - James 1:27 To have a care of them , and to help them as much as we can .

GNV	James	2	1	My [ a ] brethren , have not the faith of our [ b ] glorious Lord Jesus Christ ( A ) in respect of persons .
GNV	James	2	14	[ p ] What availeth it my brethren , though a man saith , he hath faith , when he hath no works ? can that faith save him ?
GNV	James	2	15	[ q ] For if a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food ,
GNV	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father [ u ] justified through works , ( B ) when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
GNV	James	2	3	And ye have a respect to him that weareth the gay clothing ; and say unto him , Sit thou here in a [ c ] goodly place , and say unto the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool ,
GNV	James	2	4	Are ye not partial in [ d ] your selves , and are become Judges of evil thoughts ?
GNV	James	2	5	[ e ] Hearken my beloved brethren , hath not God chosen the [ f ] poor of this world , that they should be rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him ?
GNV	James	2	6	But ye have despised the poor . [ g ] Do not the rich oppress you by tyranny , and do they not draw you before the judgment seats ?
GNV	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the worthy Name after which ye be [ h ] named ?
GNV	James	2	8	[ i ] But if ye fulfill the [ j ] royal Law according to the Scripture , which saith , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ye do well .
GNV	James	2	9	But if ye regard the persons , ye commit sin , and are rebuked of the Law , as transgressors .
GNV	James	2	10	[ k ] For whosoever shall keep the whole Law , and yet faileth in one point , he is guilty of [ l ] all .
GNV	James	2	11	[ m ] For he that said , Thou shalt not commit adultery , said also , Thou shalt not kill . Now though thou doest none adultery , yet if thou killest , thou art a transgressor of the Law .
GNV	James	2	12	[ n ] So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judgeth by the Law of liberty .
GNV	James	2	13	For there shall be condemnation merciless to him that showeth not [ o ] mercy , and mercy rejoiceth against condemnation .
GNV	James	2	16	And one of you say unto them , Depart in peace : warm yourselves , and fill your bellies , notwithstanding ye give them not those things , which are needful to the body , what helpeth it ?
GNV	James	2	17	Even so the faith , if it have no works , is dead in itself .
GNV	James	2	18	But [ r ] some man might say , Thou hast the faith , and I have works : show me thy faith out of thy works , and I will show thee my faith by my works .
GNV	James	2	19	[ s ] Thou believest that there is one God : thou doest well : the devils also believe it , and tremble .
GNV	James	2	20	[ t ] But wilt thou understand , O thou vain man , that the faith which is without works , is dead ?
GNV	James	2	22	Seest thou not that the faith [ v ] wrought with his works ? and through the works was the faith made [ w ] perfect .
GNV	James	2	23	And the Scripture was [ x ] fulfilled which saith , ( C ) Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the friend of God .
GNV	James	2	24	[ y ] Ye see then how that of works a man is [ z ] justified , and not of [ aa ] faith only .
GNV	James	2	25	[ ab ] Likewise also was not ( D ) Rahab the harlot justified through works , when she had received the messengers , and sent them out another way ?
GNV	James	2	26	[ ac ] For as the body without the spirit is dead , even so the faith without works is dead . Footnotes - James 2:1 The fifth : Charity which proceedeth from a true faith , can not stand with the accepting of persons : which he proveth plainly by setting forth their example , who with the reproach or disdain of the poor , honor the rich . - James 2:1 For if we knew what Christ ’ s glory is , and esteemed it as we ought to do , there would not be such respect of persons as there is . - James 2:3 In a worshipful and honorable place . - James 2:4 Have ye not ( which you ought not to do ) by this means with yourselves judged one man to be preferred before another ? - James 2:5 He showeth that they are perverse and naughty Judges , which prefer the rich before the poor , by that that God on the contrary side preferreth the poor , whom he hath enriched with true riches , before the rich . - James 2:5 The needy and wretched , and ( if we measure it after the opinion of the world ) the veriest abjects of all men . - James 2:6 Secondly , he proveth them to be mad men : for that the rich men are rather to be holden execrable and cursed , considering that they persecute the Church , and blaspheme Christ : for he speaketh of wicked and profane rich men , such as the most part of them have been always , against whom he setteth the poor and abject . - James 2:7 Word for word , which is called upon of you . - James 2:8 The conclusion : Charity which God prescribeth can not agree with the accepting of persons , seeing that we must walk in the King ’ s highway . - James 2:8 The Law is said to be royal and like the King ’ s highway , for that it is plain and without turnings , and that the Law calleth everyone our neighbor , without respect , whom we may help by any kind of duty . - James 2:10 A new argument to prove the same conclusion : They do not love their neighbors , which neglect some , and ambitiously honor others : for he doth not obey God , which cutteth off from the commandments of God that that is not so commodious for him , nay he is rather guilty generally for the breach of the whole Law , although he observe the residue . - James 2:10 Not that all sins are equal , but because he that breaketh one tittle of the Law , offendeth the majesty of the Lawgiver . - James 2:11 A proof : because the Lawmaker is always one and the selfsame , and the body of the Law can not be divided . - James 2:12 The conclusion of the whole treatise : we are upon this condition delivered from the curse of the Law by the mercy of God , that in like sort we should maintain and cherish charity and goodwill one towards another , and whoso doth not so , shall not taste of the grace of God . - James 2:13 He that is hard and currish against his neighbor , or else helpeth him not , he shall find God an hard and rough Judge to himselfward . - James 2:14 The fifth place which hangeth very well with the former treatise , touching a true and lively faith . And the proposition of this place is this : faith which bringeth not forth works , is not that faith whereby we are justified , but an image of faith : or else this , they are not justified by faith , which show not the effects of faith . - James 2:15 The first reason taken of a similitude : If a man say to one that is hungry , Fill thy belly , and yet giveth him nothing , this shall not be true charity : so if a man say he believeth , and bringeth forth no works of his faith , this shall not be a true faith , but a certain dead thing set out with the name of faith , whereof no man hath to brag , unless he will openly incur reprehension , seeing that the cause is understood by the effects . - James 2:18 Nay , thus may every man beat down the pride . - James 2:19 Another reason taken of an absurdity : If such a faith were the true faith whereby we are justified , the devils should be justified : for they have that , but yet notwithstanding they tremble , and are not justified therefore , neither is that faith a true faith . - James 2:20 The third reason from the example of Abraham , who no doubt had a true faith : but he in offering his son , showed himself to have that faith which was not void of works , and therefore he received a true testimony when it was said , that faith was imputed to him for righteousness . - James 2:21 Was he not by his works known and found to be justified ? for he speaketh not here of the causes of justification , but by what effects we may know that a man is justified . - James 2:22 Was effectual and fruitful with good works . - James 2:22 That the faith was declared to be a true faith , and that by works . - James 2:23 Then was the Scripture fulfilled , when it appeared plainly , how truly it was written of Abraham . - James 2:24 The conclusion : he is only justified that hath that faith which hath works following it . - James 2:24 Is proved to be just . - James 2:24 Of that dead and fruitless faith which you boast of . - James 2:25 A fourth reason taken from a like example of Rahab the harlot , who also proved by her works that she was justified by a true faith . - James 2:26 The conclusion repeated again : faith which bringeth not forth fruits and works , is not faith , but a dead carcass .

GNV	James	3	2	For in many things we [ d ] sin all . [ e ] If any man sin not in word , he is a perfect man , and able to bridle all the body .
GNV	James	3	6	And the tongue is fire , yea , a [ h ] world of wickedness : so is the tongue set among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and [ i ] setteth on fire the course of nature , and it is set on fire of hell .
GNV	James	3	15	This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , and devilish .
GNV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above , is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , easy to be entreated , full of [ n ] mercy and good fruits , without judging , and without hypocrisy .
GNV	James	3	1	My [ a ] brethren , be not many masters , [ b ] knowing that we [ c ] shall receive the greater condemnation .
GNV	James	3	4	Behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small rudder , whithersoever the governor listeth .
GNV	James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth of great things : [ g ] behold , how great a thing a little fire kindleth .
GNV	James	3	7	For the whole nature of beasts , and of birds , and of creeping things , and things of the sea is tamed , and hath been tamed of the nature of man .
GNV	James	3	8	But the tongue can no man tame . It is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
GNV	James	3	9	[ j ] Therewith bless we God even the Father , and therewith curse we men , which are made after the [ k ] similitude of God .
GNV	James	3	10	[ l ] Out of one mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing : my brethren , these things ought not so to be .
GNV	James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth at one place sweet water and bitter ?
GNV	James	3	12	Can the fig tree , my brethren , bring forth olives , either a vine figs ? so can no fountain make both salt water and sweet .
GNV	James	3	13	[ m ] Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him show by good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom .
GNV	James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , rejoice not , neither be liars against the truth .
GNV	James	3	16	For where envying and strife is , there is sedition , and all manner of evil works .
GNV	James	3	18	[ o ] And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace , of them that make peace . Footnotes - James 3:1 The sixth part or place : Let no man usurp ( as most men ambitiously do ) authority to judge and censure others righteously . - James 3:1 A reason : Because they provoke God ’ s severity against themselves , which do so curiously and rigorously condemn others , being themselves guilty and faulty . - James 3:1 Unless we surcease from this masterlike and proud finding fault with others . - James 3:2 Or , stumble . - James 3:2 The seventh place , touching the bridling of the tongue , joined with the former , so that it is manifest that there is no man which may not justly be found fault withal , seeing it is a rare virtue to bridle the tongue . - James 3:3 He showeth by two similitudes the one taken from the bridles of horses , the other from the rudders of ships , how great matters may be brought to pass by the good moderation of the tongue . - James 3:5 On the contrary part he showeth how great discommodities arise by the intemperance of the tongue , throughout the whole world , to the end that men may so much the more diligently give themselves to moderate it . - James 3:6 An heap of all mischiefs . - James 3:6 It is able to set the whole world on fire . - James 3:9 Amongst other faults of the tongue , the Apostle chiefly reproveth backbiting and speaking evil of our neighbors , even in them especially which otherwise will seem godly and religious . - James 3:9 He denieth by two reasons , that God can be praised by that man , that useth cursed speaking , or to backbite : first because man is the image of God , which whosoever reverenceth not doth not honor God himself . - James 3:10 Secondly , because the order of nature which God hath set in things , will not suffer things that are so contrary the one to the other , to stand the one with the other . - James 3:13 The eighth part which hangeth with the former , touching meekness of mind , against which he setteth envy and a contentious mind . And in the beginning he stoppeth the mouth of the chief fountain of all these mischiefs , to wit , a false persuasion of wisdom , whereas notwithstanding there is no true wisdom , but that is heavenly , and frameth our minds to all kinds of true moderation and simplicity . - James 3:17 He setteth mercy against the fierce and cruel nature of man , and showeth that heavenly wisdom bringeth forth good fruits , for he that is heavenly wise , referreth all things to God ’ s glory , and the profit of his neighbor . - James 3:18 Because the world persuadeth itself that they are miserable which live peaceably and simply , on the contrary side the Apostle pronounceth that they shall at the length reap the harvest of peaceable righteousness .

GNV	James	4	1	From [ a ] whence are wars and contentions among you ? are they not hence , even of your pleasures , that fight in your members ?
GNV	James	4	7	( B ) [ e ] Submit yourselves to God : resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
GNV	James	4	8	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners , and purge your hearts , ye double minded .
GNV	James	4	3	Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye might lay the same on your pleasures .
GNV	James	4	10	( C ) Cast down yourselves before the Lord , and he will lift you up .
GNV	James	4	14	( And yet ye can not tell what shall be tomorrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time , and afterward vanisheth away . )
GNV	James	4	2	Ye lust , and have not : ye envy , and desire immoderately , and can not obtain : ye fight , and war , and get nothing , [ b ] because ye ask not .
GNV	James	4	5	[ d ] Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain , The spirit that dwelleth in us , lusteth after envy ?
GNV	James	4	6	But the Scripture offereth more grace , and therefore saith , ( A ) God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
GNV	James	4	9	[ f ] Suffer afflictions , and sorrow ye , and weep : let your laughter be turned into mourning , and your joy into [ g ] heaviness .
GNV	James	4	11	[ h ] Speak not evil one of another , brethren . He that speaketh evil of his brother , or he that condemneth his brother , speaketh evil of the Law , and condemneth the Law : and if thou condemnest the Law , thou art not an observer of the Law , but a judge .
GNV	James	4	12	There is one Lawgiver , which is able to save , and to destroy , ( D ) Who art thou that judgest another man ?
GNV	James	4	13	[ i ] Go to now , ye that say , Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy and sell , and get gain ,
GNV	James	4	15	For that ye ought to say , ( E ) If the Lord will , and if we live , we will do this or that .
GNV	James	4	16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil .
GNV	James	4	17	[ j ] Therefore to him that knoweth how to do well , and doeth it not , to him it is sin . Footnotes - James 4:1 He goeth on forward in the same argument , condemning certain other causes of wars and contentions , to wit , unbridled pleasures and immoderate lusts , by their effects , for so much as the Lord doth worthily make them void , so that they bring nothing else to them in whom they are but incurable torments . - James 4:2 He reprehendeth them by name , which are not ashamed to go about to make God the minister and helper of their lusts and pleasures , in asking things which either are of themselves unlawful , or being lawful , ask them to wicked purposes and uses . - James 4:4 Another reason why such unbridled lusts and pleasures are utterly to be condemned , to wit , because that he that giveth himself to the world , divorceth himself from God , and breaketh the band of that holy and spiritual marriage . - James 4:5 The taking away of an objection : Indeed our minds run headlong into these vices , but we ought so much the more diligently take heed of them : which care and study shall not be in vain , seeing that God resists the stubborn , and giveth that grace to the modest and humble that surmounteth all those vices . - James 4:7 The conclusion : We must set the contrary virtues against those vices , and therefore whereas we obeyed the suggestions of the devil , we must submit our minds to God , and resist the devil , with a certain and assured hope of victory : To be short , we must employ ourselves to come near unto God by purity and sincerity of life . - James 4:9 He goeth on in the same comparison of contraries , and setteth against those profane joys with an earnest sorrow of mind , and against pride and arrogance , holy modesty . - James 4:9 By this word the Greeks meant an heaviness joined with shamefastness , which is to be seen in a cast down countenance , and settled as it were upon the ground . - James 4:11 He reprehended most sharply another double mischief of pride : the one is in that the proud and arrogant will have other men to live according to their will and pleasure and therefore they do most arrogantly condemn whatsoever pleaseth them not : which thing can not be done without great injury to our only Lawmaker , for by this means his Laws are found fault withal , as not circumspectly enough written , and men challenge that unto themselves which properly belongeth to God alone , in that they lay a Law upon men ’ s consciences . - James 4:13 The other fault is this : that men do so confidently determine upon these and those matters and businesses , as though that every moment of their life did not depend of God . - James 4:17 The conclusion of all the former treatise : The knowledge of the will of God doth not only nothing at all profit , unless the life be answerable unto it , but also maketh the sins far more grievous .

GNV	James	5	1	Go [ a ] to now , ye rich men : weep , and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you .
GNV	James	5	7	[ e ] Be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . [ f ] Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the former , and the latter rain .
GNV	James	5	8	Be ye also patient therefore , and settle your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth near .
GNV	James	5	11	Behold , we count them blessed which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have known what [ k ] end the Lord made . For the Lord is very pitiful and merciful .
GNV	James	5	14	[ o ] Is any sick among you ? Let him call for the Elders of the Church , and let them pray for him , and anoint him with ( B ) [ p ] oil in the [ q ] Name of the Lord .
GNV	James	5	2	Your riches are corrupt , and your garments are moth eaten .
GNV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered , and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh , as it were fire . Ye have heaped up treasure for the last days .
GNV	James	5	4	Behold , the hire of the laborers , which have reaped your fields ( which is of you kept back by fraud ) crieth , and the cries of them which have reaped , are entered into the [ b ] ears of the Lord of hosts .
GNV	James	5	6	Ye have condemned , and have killed the just , and he hath not resisted you .
GNV	James	5	9	[ g ] [ h ] Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : [ i ] behold , the judge standeth before the door .
GNV	James	5	10	[ j ] Take , my brethren , the Prophets for an example of suffering adversity , and of long patience , which have spoken in the name of the Lord .
GNV	James	5	12	[ l ] But before all things , my brethren , ( A ) swear not , neither by heaven , nor by earth , nor by any other oath : but let [ m ] your yea , be yea , and your nay , nay , lest ye fall into condemnation .
GNV	James	5	13	[ n ] Is any among you afflicted ? Let him pray . Is any merry ? Let him sing .
GNV	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up : and if he have committed [ r ] sins , they shall be forgiven him .
GNV	James	5	16	[ s ] Acknowledge your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed : [ t ] for the prayer of a righteous man availeth much , if it be fervent .
GNV	James	5	17	( C ) Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months .
GNV	James	5	18	And he prayed again : and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
GNV	James	5	19	[ u ] Brethren , ( D ) If any of you hath erred from the truth , and some man hath [ v ] converted him ,
GNV	James	5	20	Let him know that he which hath converted the sinner from going astray out of his way , shall save a soul from death , and shall hide a multitude of sins . Footnotes - James 5:1 He denounceth utter destruction to the wicked and profane rich men , and such as are drowned in their riotousness , mocking at their foolish confidence when as there is nothing indeed more vain than such things . - James 5:4 The Lord who is more mighty than ye are , hath heard them . - James 5:5 Ye have pampered up yourselves . - James 5:5 The Hebrews call a day that is appointed to solemn banqueting , a day of slaughter or feasting . - James 5:7 He applieth that to the poor , which he spake against the rich , warning them to wait for the Lord ’ s coming patiently , who will revenge the injuries which the rich men do them . - James 5:7 The taking away of an objection : Although his coming serve to linger , yet at the least we must follow the husbandmen , who do patiently wait for the times that are proper for the fruits of the earth . And again , God will not defer the least iota of the time that he hath appointed . - James 5:9 He commendeth Christian patience , so that whereas others through impatience use to accuse one another , the faithful on the contrary side complain not , although they receive injury . - James 5:9 By grudging , he meaneth a certain inward complaining which betokeneth impatience . - James 5:9 The conclusion : The Lord is at the door , who will defend his own , and revenge his enemies , and therefore we need not to trouble ourselves . - James 5:10 Because most men are wont to object , that it is good to repel injuries by what means soever , he setteth against that , the examples of the Fathers , whose patience had a most happy end , because God as a most bountiful Father , never forsaketh his . - James 5:11 What end the Lord gave . - James 5:12 Because even the best men sometimes through impatience break out into oaths sometimes lesser , sometimes greater , the Apostle warneth us to detest such wickedness , and to accustom our tongues to simple and true talk . - James 5:12 That that you have to say or affirm , speak or affirm it simply , and without an oath : and that that you will deny , deny it simply and flatly . - James 5:13 He showeth the best remedy against all afflictions , to wit , prayers which have their place both in sorrow and joy . - James 5:14 He showeth peculiarly , to what physicians especially we must go , when we are diseased , to wit , to the prayers of the Elders , which then also could cure the body , ( for so much as the gift of healing was then in force ) and take away the chiefest cause of sickness and diseases , by obtaining for the sick through their prayers and exhortations , remission of sins . - James 5:14 This was a sign of the gift of healing : and now seeing we have the gift no more , the sign is no longer necessary . - James 5:14 By calling on the Name of the Lord . - James 5:15 He hath reason in making mention of sins , for diseases are for the most part sent because of sins . - James 5:16 Because God pardoneth their sins which confess and acknowledge them , and not theirs which justify themselves , therefore the Apostle addeth , that we ought freely to confer one with another touching those inward diseases , that we may help one another with our prayers . - James 5:16 He commendeth prayers by the effects that come of them , that all men may understand that there is nothing more effectual than they are , so that they proceed from a pure mind . - James 5:19 The taking away of an objection : All reprehensions are not condemned , seeing that on the contrary part there is nothing more acceptable to God , than to call into the way a brother that was wandering out of the way . - James 5:19 Hath called him back from his way .

GNV	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter 1:25 Again , lest any man should seek that spiritual force and virtue in fained imaginations , the Apostle calleth us back to the word of God : teaching us furthermore , that there is no other word of the Lord to be looked for , than this which is preached , in which only we must trust .

GNV	1%20Peter	2	15	[ w ] For so is the will of God , that by well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	16	As free , and not as having the liberty for a cloak of maliciousness , but as the servants of God .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	17	[ x ] [ y ] Honor all men : ( L ) love [ z ] brotherly fellowship : fear God : honor the King .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	18	( M ) [ aa ] Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear , not only to the good and courteous , but also to the froward .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	19	( N ) [ ab ] For this is thankworthy , if a man for [ ac ] conscience toward God endure grief , suffering wrongly .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	20	For what praise is it , if when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye take it patiently ? but and if when ye do well , ye suffer wrong and take it patiently , this is acceptable to God .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	22	( O ) Who did no sin , neither was there guile found in his mouth .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	23	Who when he was reviled , reviled not again : when he suffered , he threatened not , but [ af ] committed it to him [ ag ] that judgeth righteously .
GNV	1%20Peter	2	24	( P ) [ ah ] Who his own self bare our sins in his body on the tree , that we being dead to sin , should live in righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .

GNV	1%20Peter	3	6	As Sarah obeyed Abraham , and ( C ) called him Sir : whose daughters ye are , while ye do well , [ g ] not being afraid of any terror .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	8	[ q ] Finally , be ye all of one mind : one suffer with another : love as brethren : be pitiful , be courteous .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	14	( H ) Notwithstanding blessed are ye , if ye suffer for righteousness ’ sake . [ x ] Yea , ( I ) fear not their [ y ] fear , neither be troubled .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	15	But [ z ] sanctify the Lord God in your hearts , [ aa ] and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you , with meekness and reverence .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	18	( J ) [ ac ] For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , [ ad ] the just for the unjust , [ ae ] that he might bring us to God , [ af ] and was put to death concerning the [ ag ] flesh , but was quickened by the spirit .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	2	While they behold your pure conversation which is with fear :
GNV	1%20Peter	3	4	But let it be the [ d ] hidden man of the heart , which consisteth in the incorruption of a meek and quiet spirit , which is [ e ] before God a thing much set by .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	5	[ f ] For even after this manner in time past did the holy women , which trusted in God , tire themselves , and were subject to their husbands .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	7	( D ) [ h ] Likewise ye husbands , [ i ] dwell with them as men of [ j ] knowledge , [ k ] giving [ l ] honor unto the woman , as unto the weaker [ m ] vessel , [ n ] even as they which are heirs together of the [ o ] grace of life , [ p ] that your prayers be not interrupted .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	9	( E ) [ r ] Not rendering evil for evil , neither rebuke for rebuke : but contrariwise bless , [ s ] knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should be heirs of blessing .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	10	( F ) [ t ] For if any man long after life , and to [ u ] see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	11	( G ) Let him eschew evil and do good : let him seek peace and follow after it .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : and the [ v ] face of the Lord is against them that do evil .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	13	[ w ] And who is it that will harm you , if ye follow that which is good ?
GNV	1%20Peter	3	16	Having a good conscience , that when they speak evil of you as of evil doers , they may be ashamed which slander your good conversation in Christ .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	17	[ ab ] For it is better ( if the will of God be so ) that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	19	[ ah ] By [ ai ] the which he also went , and preached unto the [ aj ] spirits that are in prison .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	20	Which were in time passed disobedient , when [ ak ] once the long suffering of God abode in the days of ( K ) Noah , while the Ark was preparing , wherein few , that is , eight [ al ] souls were saved in the water .
GNV	1%20Peter	3	21	[ am ] Whereof the baptism that now is , answering that figure , ( which is not a putting away of the filth of the flesh , but a confident demanding with a good conscience maketh to [ an ] God ) saveth us also [ ao ] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ .

GNV	1%20Peter	4	6	[ g ] For unto this purpose was the Gospel preached also unto the dead , that they might be condemned according to men in the flesh , but might live according to God in the spirit .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	12	[ n ] Dearly beloved , think it not [ o ] strange [ p ] concerning the fiery trial , which is among you to prove you as though some strange thing were come unto you .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	19	[ w ] Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God , commit their souls to him in well doing , as unto a faithful Creator . Footnotes -

GNV	1%20Peter	4	5	Which shall give account to him , that is ready to judge quick and dead .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	7	[ h ] Now the end of all things is at hand . Be ye therefore sober , and watching in prayer .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	8	[ i ] But above all things have fervent love among you : ( B ) for love shall cover the multitude of sins .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	9	[ j ] Be ye ( C ) harberous one to another , without grudging .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	10	[ k ] ( D ) Let every man as he hath received the gift , minister the same one to another , [ l ] as good disposers of the manifold grace of God .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	11	[ m ] If any man speak , let him speak as the words of God . If any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God ministereth , that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom is praise and dominion forever , and ever , Amen .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	13	[ q ] But rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ ’ s sufferings , that when his glory shall appear , ye may be glad and rejoice .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	14	( E ) [ r ] If ye be railed upon for the Name of Christ , blessed are ye : for the [ s ] spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : which on their part is evil spoken of , but on your part is glorified .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	15	[ t ] But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or an evil doer , or as a busybody in other men ’ s matters .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	16	But if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed : but let him glorify God in this behalf .
GNV	1%20Peter	4	17	[ u ] For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God . [ v ] If it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them which obey not the Gospel of God ?

GNV	2%20Peter	1	3	[ d ] According as his [ e ] divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto [ f ] life and godliness , through the [ g ] acknowledging of him that hath called us unto glory and virtue .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	5	[ l ] Therefore give even all diligence thereunto : [ m ] join moreover virtue with your faith : and with virtue , knowledge :
GNV	2%20Peter	1	6	[ n ] And with knowledge , temperance : and with temperance , patience : and with patience , godliness :
GNV	2%20Peter	1	12	[ r ] Wherefore , I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though that ye have knowledge , and be established in the present truth .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	14	Seeing I know that the time is at hand that I must lay down this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath ( A ) showed me .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	16	( C ) [ t ] For we followed not deceivable fables , when we opened unto you the power , and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but with our eyes we saw his majesty :
GNV	2%20Peter	1	4	[ h ] Whereby most great and precious promises are given unto us , that by them ye should be partakers of the [ i ] divine nature , in that ye flee the corruption , which is in the [ j ] world through [ k ] lust .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	7	And with godliness , brotherly kindness : and with brotherly kindness , love .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	8	[ o ] For if these things be among you , and abound , they will make you that ye neither shall be idle , nor unfruitful in the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ :
GNV	2%20Peter	1	9	For he that hath not these things , is blind , and [ p ] can not see far off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	10	[ q ] Wherefore , brethren , give rather diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	11	For by this means an entering shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	13	For I think it meet as long as I am in this [ s ] tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ,
GNV	2%20Peter	1	15	( B ) I will endeavor therefore always , that ye also may be able to have remembrance of these things after my departing .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	17	For he received of God the Father honor and glory , when there came such a voice to him from that excellent Glory , ( D ) This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	18	And this voice we heard when it came from heaven being with him in the holy mount .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	19	[ u ] We have also a most sure word of the Prophets , [ v ] to the which ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the [ w ] day dawns , and the [ x ] day star arise in your hearts .
GNV	2%20Peter	1	20	( E ) [ y ] So that ye first know this , that no prophecy of the [ z ] Scripture is of any [ aa ] private interpretation :
GNV	2%20Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but [ ab ] holy men of God spake as they were [ ac ] moved by the holy Ghost . Footnotes -

GNV	2%20Peter	2	1	But [ a ] there were false prophets also among the [ b ] people , even as there shall be false teachers among you : which privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that hath bought them , and bring upon themselves swift damnation .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	13	And shall receive the wages of unrighteousness , as they which count it pleasure daily to live deliciously . [ s ] Spots they are and blots , delighting themselves in their deceivings , [ t ] in feasting with you .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	12	[ p ] But these as natural brute beasts , led with sensuality and [ q ] made to be taken , and destroyed , speak evil of those things which they know not , and shall perish through their own [ r ] corruption .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	17	( E ) [ v ] These are [ w ] wells without water , and clouds carried about with a tempest , to whom the [ x ] black darkness is reserved forever .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	20	( G ) [ ab ] For if they , after they have escaped from the filthiness of the world , through the acknowledging of the Lord , and of the Savior Jesus Christ , are yet tangled again therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	3	[ d ] And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make [ e ] merchandise of you , [ f ] whose condemnation long since resteth not , and their destruction slumbereth not .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the ( A ) Angels that had sinned , but cast them down into [ g ] hell , and delivered them into [ h ] chains of darkness , to be kept unto damnation :
GNV	2%20Peter	2	5	Neither hath spared the [ i ] old world , but saved ( B ) Noah the eighth person a [ j ] preacher of righteousness , and brought in the Flood upon the world of the ungodly ,
GNV	2%20Peter	2	6	And ( C ) turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes , condemned them and overthrew them , and made them an ensample unto them that after should live ungodly ,
GNV	2%20Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot vexed with the uncleanly conversation of the wicked :
GNV	2%20Peter	2	8	( For he being righteous , and dwelling among them , in [ k ] seeing and hearing , [ l ] vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds . )
GNV	2%20Peter	2	9	The Lord [ m ] knoweth to deliver the godly out of tentation , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment under punishment :
GNV	2%20Peter	2	10	[ n ] And chiefly them that walk after the flesh , in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government , which are bold , and stand in their own conceit , and fear not to speak evil of them that are in [ o ] dignity .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	11	Whereas the Angels which are greater both in power and might , give not railing judgment against them before the Lord .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	14	[ u ] Having eyes full of adultery , and that can not cease to sin , beguiling unstable souls , they have hearts exercised with covetousness , they are the children of curse :
GNV	2%20Peter	2	15	Which forsaking the right way , have gone astray following the way of ( D ) Balaam , the son of Beor , which loved the wages of unrighteousness .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	16	But he was rebuked for his iniquity : for the dumb beast speaking with man ’ s voice forbade the foolishness of the Prophet .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	18	For in speaking [ y ] swelling words of vanity , they [ z ] beguile with wantonness through the lusts of the flesh them that were [ aa ] clean escaped from them which are wrapped in error ,
GNV	2%20Peter	2	19	Promising unto them liberty , and are themselves the ( F ) servants of corruption : for of whomsoever a man is overcome , even unto the same is he in bondage .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have acknowledged the way of righteousness , than after they have acknowledged it , to turn from the holy commandment given unto them .
GNV	2%20Peter	2	22	But it is come unto them according to the true proverb , ( H ) The dog is returned to his own vomit : and the sow that was washed , to the wallowing in the mire . Footnotes -
GNV	2%20Peter	3	2	Peter 3:16 That is to say , among the which things : for he disputeth not here whether Paul ’ s Epistles be plain or dark , but saith , that amongst those things which Paul hath written of his Epistles , and Peter himself in these two of his own , there are some things which can not be easily understood , and therefore are of some drawn to their own destruction : and this he saith to make us more attentive and diligent , and not remove us from the reading of holy things , for to what end should they have written vain speculations ?

GNV	2%20Peter	3	1	This [ a ] second Epistle I now write unto you , beloved , wherewith I stir up , and warn your pure minds ,
GNV	2%20Peter	3	8	[ j ] Dearly beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord , ( B ) as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	12	Looking for , and [ p ] hasting unto the coming of that day of God , by the which the heavens being on fire , shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with heat ?
GNV	2%20Peter	3	14	Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in [ r ] peace , without spot and blameless .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	15	( F ) And suppose that the long suffering of our Lord is salvation , [ s ] even as our beloved brother Paul according to the wisdom given unto him wrote to you .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	4	[ d ] And say , Where is the promise of his coming ? for since the Fathers died , all things continue alike from the beginning of the creation .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	5	[ e ] For this they willingly know not , that the heavens were of old , and the [ f ] earth that was of the water , and by the water , by the word of God .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	6	[ g ] Wherefore the world that then was , perished , overflowed with the [ h ] water .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	7	[ i ] But the heavens and earth , which are now , are kept by the same word in store , and reserved unto fire against the day of condemnation , and of the destruction of ungodly men .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	9	[ k ] The Lord of that promise is not slack ( as some men count slackness ) [ l ] but is patient toward us , and ( C ) would have no man to perish , but would all men to come to repentance .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	10	[ m ] But the day ( D ) of the Lord will come as a thief in the night , in the which the heavens shall pass away with a [ n ] noise , and the elements shall melt with heat , and the earth with the works that are therein shall be burnt up .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	11	[ o ] Seeing therefore that all these things must be dissolved , what manner persons ought ye to be in holy conversation and godliness ,
GNV	2%20Peter	3	13	But we look for ( E ) new heavens , and a new earth , according to his promise , [ q ] wherein dwelleth righteousness .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	16	As one that in all his Epistles speaketh of these things : [ t ] among the [ u ] which , some things are hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable , wrest , as they do also other Scriptures unto their own destruction .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	17	Ye therefore beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware , lest ye be also plucked away with the error of the wicked , and fall from your own steadfastness .
GNV	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ : to him be glory both now and for evermore . Amen . Footnotes -

GNV	1%20John	2	24	[ ap ] Let therefore abide in you that same which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning , shall remain in you , ye shall also continue in the Son , and in the Father .
GNV	1%20John	2	4	[ h ] He that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
GNV	1%20John	2	5	[ i ] But he that keepeth his word , in him is the [ j ] love of God perfect indeed : hereby we know that we are in [ k ] him .
GNV	1%20John	2	6	[ l ] He that saith he remaineth in him , ought even so to walk as he hath walked .
GNV	1%20John	2	7	[ m ] Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment , which ye have had from the beginning : this old commandment is that word , which ye have heard from the beginning .
GNV	1%20John	2	8	[ n ] Again , a new commandment I write unto you , that [ o ] which is true in him : and also in you : for the darkness is past , and that true light now shineth .
GNV	1%20John	2	9	[ p ] He that saith that he is in that light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness , until this time .
GNV	1%20John	2	10	( A ) He that loveth his brother , abideth in that light , and there is no occasion of evil in him .
GNV	1%20John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother , is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
GNV	1%20John	2	13	[ t ] I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . [ u ] I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome that wicked one . [ v ] I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
GNV	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in this world , ( as the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life ) is not of the Father , but is of this world .
GNV	1%20John	2	17	[ aa ] And this world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that fulfilleth the will of God , abideth ever .
GNV	1%20John	2	19	[ af ] They went out from us , but they were not of us : for if they had been of us , [ ag ] they should have continued with us . [ ah ] But this cometh to pass , that it might appear , that they are not all of us .
GNV	1%20John	2	20	[ ai ] But ye have an [ aj ] ointment from that [ ak ] Holy one , and know all things .
GNV	1%20John	2	21	[ al ] I have not written unto you , because ye know not the truth : but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
GNV	1%20John	2	22	[ am ] Who is a liar , but he that denieth that Jesus is [ an ] that Christ ? the same is that Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son .
GNV	1%20John	2	23	[ ao ] Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father .
GNV	1%20John	2	25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even that eternal life .
GNV	1%20John	2	26	[ aq ] These things have I written unto you , concerning them that deceive you .
GNV	1%20John	2	27	But that [ ar ] anointing which ye received of him , dwelleth in you : and ye [ as ] need not that any man teach you : but as the same [ at ] anointing teacheth you of all things , and it is true and is not lying , and as it taught you , ye shall abide in him .
GNV	1%20John	2	28	[ au ] And now , little children , abide in him , that when he shall appear , we may be bold , and not be ashamed before him , at his coming .

GNV	1%20John	3	7	[ o ] Little children , let no man deceive you , he that doeth righteousness , is righteous , as he is righteous .
GNV	1%20John	3	19	[ ai ] For thereby we know that we are of the truth , [ aj ] and shall before him assure our hearts .
GNV	1%20John	3	22	( H ) [ am ] And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things which are pleasing in his sight .
GNV	1%20John	3	2	[ e ] Dearly beloved , now are we the sons of God , but yet it is not made manifest what we shall be : and we know that when he shall be made manifest : we shall be [ f ] like him : for we shall see him [ g ] as he is .
GNV	1%20John	3	4	[ j ] Whosoever [ k ] commiteth sin , transgresseth also the Law : for [ l ] sin is the transgression of the Law .
GNV	1%20John	3	5	[ m ] And ye know that he was made manifest , that he might ( A ) take away our sins , and in him is no sin .
GNV	1%20John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him , sinneth not : whosoever [ n ] sinneth , hath not seen him , neither hath known him .
GNV	1%20John	3	8	[ p ] He that ( B ) commiteth sin , is of the [ q ] devil : for the devil [ r ] sinneth from the [ s ] beginning : for this purpose was made manifest that Son of God , that he might loose the works of the devil .
GNV	1%20John	3	9	Whosoever is born of God sinneth not : for his [ t ] seed remaineth in him , neither can he sin , because he is born of God .
GNV	1%20John	3	10	[ u ] In this are the children of God known , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness , is not of God , [ v ] neither he that loveth not his brother .
GNV	1%20John	3	11	[ w ] For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that ( C ) we should love one another ,
GNV	1%20John	3	12	[ x ] Not as ( D ) [ y ] Cain which was of that wicked one , and slew his brother : [ z ] and wherefore slew he him ? because his own works were evil , and his brother ’ s good .
GNV	1%20John	3	13	Marvel not my brethren , though this world hate you .
GNV	1%20John	3	14	[ aa ] We know that we are [ ab ] translated from death unto life , because we love the brethren : ( E ) he that loveth not his brother , abideth in death .
GNV	1%20John	3	15	[ ac ] Whosoever hateth his brother , is a manslayer : and ye know that no manslayer hath eternal life abiding in him .
GNV	1%20John	3	16	( F ) [ ad ] Hereby have we perceived love , that he laid down his life for us : therefore we ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren .
GNV	1%20John	3	17	( G ) [ ae ] And whosoever hath this [ af ] world ’ s good , and seeth his brother have need , and [ ag ] shutteth up his compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
GNV	1%20John	3	18	[ ah ] My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue only , but in deed and in truth .
GNV	1%20John	3	20	For [ ak ] if our hearts condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
GNV	1%20John	3	21	[ al ] Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then have we boldness toward God .
GNV	1%20John	3	23	( I ) This is then his commandment , that we believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave commandment .
GNV	1%20John	3	24	( J ) For he that keepeth his commandments , dwelleth in him , and he in him : and hereby we know that he abideth in us , even by that [ an ] Spirit which he hath given us . Footnotes -

GNV	1%20John	4	11	[ o ] Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
GNV	1%20John	4	19	[ x ] We love him , because he loved us first .
GNV	1%20John	4	2	[ c ] Hereby shall ye know the Spirit of God , [ d ] Every spirit which confesseth that [ e ] Jesus Christ is come in the [ f ] flesh is of God .
GNV	1%20John	4	3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh , is not of God : but this is the spirit of Antichrist , of whom ye have heard , how that he should come , and now already he is in this world .
GNV	1%20John	4	6	[ i ] We are of God , ( A ) he that knoweth God , heareth us : he that is not of God heareth us not . Hereby know we the [ j ] Spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
GNV	1%20John	4	8	He that loveth not , knoweth not God , [ m ] for God is [ n ] love .
GNV	1%20John	4	9	( B ) Herein was that love of God made manifest amongst us , because God sent that his only begotten Son into this world , that we might live through him .
GNV	1%20John	4	10	Herein is that love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be a reconciliation for our sins .

GNV	1%20John	5	2	[ d ] In this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his [ e ] commandments .
GNV	1%20John	5	3	[ f ] For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : [ g ] and his ( A ) commandments are not [ h ] burdenous .

GNV	2%20John	1	1	The Elder to the [ a ] elect [ b ] Lady , and her children , [ c ] whom I love in the truth : and not I only , but also all that have known the truth ,
GNV	2%20John	1	4	[ e ] I rejoiced greatly , that I found of thy children walking in [ f ] truth , as we have received a commandment of the Father .
GNV	2%20John	1	6	And this is that love that we should walk after his commandments . This commandment is , that as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
GNV	2%20John	1	7	[ g ] For many deceivers are entered into this world , which confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . He that is such one , is a deceiver and an Antichrist .

GNV	2%20John	1	9	Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . He that continueth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
GNV	2%20John	1	11	For he that biddeth him Godspeed , is partaker of his evil deeds . Although I had many things to write unto you , yet would I not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak mouth to mouth , that our joy may be full .

GNV	3%20John	1	1	The [ a ] Elder unto the beloved Gaius whom I love in the truth .
GNV	3%20John	1	9	[ f ] I wrote unto the Church , but Diotrephes which loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
GNV	3%20John	1	10	Wherefore if I come , I will call to your remembrance his deeds which he doeth , prattling against us with malicious words , and not therewith content , neither he himself receiveth the brethren , but forbideth them that would , and thrusteth them out of the Church .
GNV	3%20John	1	12	Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we ourselves bear record , and ye know that our record is true .
GNV	3%20John	1	2	Beloved , I wish chiefly that thou prosperedst and faredst well as thy soul prospereth .
GNV	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than [ b ] these , that is , to hear that my sons walk in verity .
GNV	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , thou doest [ c ] faithfully , whatsoever thou doest to the brethren , and to strangers ,
GNV	3%20John	1	6	Which bore witness of thy love before the Churches , Whom if thou [ d ] bringest on their journey as it seemeth according to God , thou shalt do well ,
GNV	3%20John	1	7	Because that for his Name ’ s sake they went forth , and took nothing of the Gentiles .
GNV	3%20John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such , that we might be [ e ] helpers to the truth .
GNV	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good : he that doeth well is of God : but he that doeth evil , hath not [ g ] seen God .
GNV	3%20John	1	13	I have many things to write : but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee :

GNV	Jude	1	1	Jude a servant of Jesus Christ , and [ a ] brother of James , to them which are called and sanctified [ b ] of God the Father , and [ c ] reserved to Jesus Christ :
GNV	Jude	1	3	[ d ] Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the [ e ] common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , to exhort you , that ye should earnestly [ f ] contend for the maintenance of the faith , which was [ g ] once given unto the Saints .
GNV	Jude	1	4	[ h ] For there are certain men crept in , which were before of old ordained to this condemnation : [ i ] ungodly men they are , which turn the grace of our God into wantonness , and ( A ) deny God the only Lord , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
GNV	Jude	1	5	[ j ] I will therefore put you in remembrance , forasmuch as ye once knew this , how that the Lord , after that he had delivered the people out of Egypt , ( B ) destroyed them afterward which believed not .
GNV	Jude	1	6	[ k ] The ( C ) Angels also which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
GNV	Jude	1	7	As ( D ) Sodom and Gomorrah , and the cities about them , which in like manner as they did , [ l ] committed fornication , and followed [ m ] strange flesh , are set forth for an example , and suffer the vengeance of eternal fire .
GNV	Jude	1	14	And Enoch also the seventh from Adam , prophesied of such , saying , ( I ) Behold , the Lord [ x ] cometh with thousands of his Saints ,
GNV	Jude	1	20	But , ye beloved , edify yourselves in your most holy faith , praying in the holy Ghost .
GNV	Jude	1	2	Mercy unto you , and peace and love be multiplied .
GNV	Jude	1	8	Likewise notwithstanding these [ n ] sleepers also defile the flesh , [ o ] and despise [ p ] government , and speak evil of them that are in authority .
GNV	Jude	1	9	[ q ] Yet Michael the Archangel , when he strove against the devil , and disputed about the body of Moses , durst not blame him with cursed speaking , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
GNV	Jude	1	10	[ r ] But these speak evil of those things , which they know not : and whatsoever things they know naturally as beasts , which are without reason , in those things they corrupt themselves .
GNV	Jude	1	11	[ s ] Woe be unto them : for they have followed the way ( E ) of Cain , and are cast away by the deceit ( F ) of Balaam ’ s wages , and perish in the gainsaying ( G ) of Korah .
GNV	Jude	1	12	[ t ] These are rocks in your [ u ] feasts of charity , when they feast with you , without [ v ] all fear , feeding themselves : ( H ) clouds they are without water , carried about of winds , corrupt trees and without fruit , twice dead , and plucked up by the roots .
GNV	Jude	1	13	They are the raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shames : they are wandering stars , to whom is reserved the [ w ] blackness of darkness forever .
GNV	Jude	1	15	To give judgment against all men , and to rebuke all the ungodly among them of all their wicked deeds , which they have ungodly committed , and of all their cruel speakings , which wicked sinners have spoken against him .
GNV	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts : ( J ) whose mouths speak proud things , having men ’ s persons in admiration , because of advantage .
GNV	Jude	1	17	[ y ] But , ye beloved , remember the words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ :
GNV	Jude	1	18	How that they told you that there should be mockers ( K ) in the last time , which should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
GNV	Jude	1	19	[ z ] These are they that separate themselves from others , natural , having not the Spirit .
GNV	Jude	1	21	And keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ , unto eternal life .
GNV	Jude	1	22	[ aa ] And have compassion of some , in putting difference :
GNV	Jude	1	23	And others save with [ ab ] fear , pulling them out of the fire , and hate even that [ ac ] garment which is spotted by the flesh .

GNV	Revelation	2	17	and

GNV	Revelation	6	1	[ a ] After I beheld when the Lamb had opened one of the seals , and I heard one of the four beasts say , as it were the noise of thunder , Come and see .
GNV	Revelation	6	3	members , the foresignifying , the caution , and the execution of all the evils which God poureth out upon this world , which hath most hardly deserved of him . The foresignifying is set down in this chapter , the caution for preserving the Church , is in the next chapter , and the execution is described , Rev . 8:9 . In every part of the foresignifying , there are three branches : the several and express calling of S. John , to prepare himself to take knowledge of the things that were to be showed unto him in the opening of the seals : the sign and the word expounding the sign : And albeit the express calling of S. John , be used only in four of the signs , yet the same is also to be understood in the rest that follow . The author of the foresignifying is the Lamb , as that word of the Father made the Mediator , opening the seals of the book . The instruments are the Angels in most of the visions , who expound the sign and words thereof . Now this first verse containeth an express calling of S. John to mark the opinion of the first seal . - Revelation 6:2 The first sign joined with declaration , is that God for the sins , and horrible rebellion of the world , will invade the same : and first of all as afar off , with his darts of pestilence most suddenly , mightily , and gloriously , bear down the same as judge , and triumph over it as conqueror . - Revelation 6:3 The second sign joined with words of declaration ( after the express calling of S. John as before ) is that God being provoked unto wrath by the obstinacy and hardheartedness of the world not repenting for the former plague , as setting upon the same hand , will kindle the fire of debate amongst men , and will destroy the inhabitants of this world , one by the sword of another . - Revelation 6:5 The third sign with declaration , is that God will destroy the world with famine , withdrawing all provision : which is by the figure Synecdoche comprehended in wheat , barley , wine and oil . - Revelation 6:6 Hereby is signified what great scarcity of corn there was , for the word here used is a kind of measure of dry things , which is in quantity but the eighth part of a bushel , which was an ordinary portion to be given servants for their stint of meat for one day . - Revelation 6:6 I had rather distinguish and read the words thus , and the wine and the oil thou shalt not deal unjustly . In this sense likewise the wine and the oil shall be sold a very little for a penny . Thou shalt not deal unjustly , namely , when thou shalt measure out a very little for a great price : so is the place evident : otherwise that is most true , which the wise man saith , that whoso withholdeth the corn shall be cursed of the people , Prov . 11:26 . - Revelation 6:7 The fourth sign joined with words of declaration , is , that God will addict the fourth part of the world indifferently , unto death and hell , or the grave by all those means at once , by which before severally and in order he had recalled their minds unto amendment . Unto these are also added the wild and cruel beasts of the earth , out of Lev . 26:22 . Thus doth God according to his wisdom dispense the treasures of his power , justly towards all , mercifully towards the good , and with patience or longsufferance towards his enemies . - Revelation 6:9 The fifth sign is that the holy martyrs which are under the altar , whereby they are sanctified , that is , received into the trust and tuition of Christ ( into whose hands they are committed ) shall cry out for the justice of God , in an holy zeal to advance his kingdom and not of any private perturbation of the mind , in this and the next verse , and that God will , in deed , sign and word comfort them , verse
GNV	Revelation	6	5	[ d ] And when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . Then I beheld , and lo , a black horse , and he that sat on him , had balances in his hand .
GNV	Revelation	6	7	[ g ] And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
GNV	Revelation	6	9	[ h ] And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were killed for the word of God , and for the testimony which they maintained .
GNV	Revelation	6	12	[ k ] And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and lo , there was a great earthquake , and the Sun was as black as [ l ] sackcloth of hair , and the Moon was like blood .
GNV	Revelation	6	2	Cor . 7:9 , as their wishings do declare : for this history is of the whole world , severed from the history of the Church , as I have showed before , Rev . 4:1 . - Revelation 6:16 These are words of such as despair of their escape : of which despair there are two arguments , the presence of God and the Lamb provoked to wrath against the world in this verse , and the conscience of their own weakness , whereby men feel that they are no way able to stand in the day of the wrath of God , verse
GNV	Revelation	6	4	And there went out another horse , that was red , and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another , and there was given unto him a great sword .
GNV	Revelation	6	8	And I looked , and behold , a pale horse , and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed after him , and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with beasts of the earth .
GNV	Revelation	6	10	And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , Lord , which art holy and true ! dost not thou judge and avenge our blood on them , that dwell on the earth ?
GNV	Revelation	6	11	. - Revelation 6:11 As before 3:4 . - Revelation 6:11 Until their number be fulfilled . - Revelation 6:12 The sixth sign , the narration whereof hath two parts , the sign , and the event . The sign is , that the earth , heaven , and the things that are in them for the horror of the sins of the world upon those most heavy foretellings of God , and complaints of the Saints shall be shaken most vehemently , trembling in horrible manner , and losing their light in this verse : falling from on high , verse
GNV	Revelation	6	13	, withdrawing themselves and flying away for the greatness of the trouble , verse
GNV	Revelation	6	14	. So boldly do all creatures depend upon the will of God , and content themselves in his glory . - Revelation 6:12 So they called in old time those woven works that were of hair . - Revelation 6:15 The event of the sign aforegoing : that there is no man that shall not be astonished at that general commotion , fly away for fear and hide himself in this verse , and wish unto himself most bitter death for exceeding horror of the wrath of God , and of the Lamb , at which before he was astonished . Now this perplexity is not of the godly , but of the wicked , whose portion is in this life , as the Psalmist speaketh , Ps . 17:14 . Not that sorrow which is according unto God , which worketh repentance unto salvation , whereof a man shall never repent him , but that worldly sorrow that bringeth death ,
GNV	Revelation	6	15	[ m ] And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in dens , and among the rocks of the mountains ,
GNV	Revelation	6	16	And said to the mountains and rocks , [ n ] ( A ) Fall on us , and hide us from the presence of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb .

GNV	Revelation	7	1	Pet . 2:9 . The name of Dan is not mentioned because the Danites long before forsaking the worship of God , were fallen away from the fellowship of God ’ s people unto the part of the Gentiles , which evil many ages before Jacob foresaw , Gen. 49:18 , for which cause also there is no mention made of this tribe in the first book of the Chronicles . - Revelation 7:7 He skipped Dan , and reckoneth Levi . - Revelation 7:8 Of Ephraim , who was Joseph ’ s other son , and had the birthright given him , whereof he is called Joseph . - Revelation 7:9 See before upon verse

GNV	Revelation	7	5	. - Revelation 7:4 That is , of the Jews a number certain in itself before God , and such as may be numbered of us : for which cause also the same is here set down as certain . But of the elect which are of the Gentiles , the number indeed is in itself certain with God , but of us not possibly to be numbered , as God , Gen. 15:5 , and often elsewhere , and Isaiah figured most excellently , Isa .

GNV	Revelation	7	17	. The cause efficient , and which containeth all these things is only one , the Lamb of God , the Lord , the Mediator , and the Savior Christ Jesus . - Revelation 7:15 He alludeth to the Levites , which served day and night , for else there is no night in heaven . - Revelation 7:15 Or , upon them , whereby is meant God ’ s defense and protection , as it were towards them , who are as safe , as men in the Lord ’ s tent . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	7	2	and
GNV	Revelation	7	4	. - Revelation 7:9 As Priests , Kings and glorious conquerors by martyrdom : which things are noted by their proper signs in this verse . - Revelation 7:10 The praise of God celebrated first by the holy men , in this verse , then by the heavenly Angels in the two verses following . - Revelation 7:13 A passage over unto the expounding of the vision , of which the Angel inquireth of S. John to stir him up withal , in this verse and John in the form of speech , both acknowledgeth his own ignorance , attributing knowledge unto the Angel , and also in most modest manner requesteth the expounding of the vision . - Revelation 7:14 The exposition of the vision , wherein the Angel telleth first the acts of the Saints , that is , their sufferings and work of faith in Christ Jesus , in this verse . Secondly their glory , both present , which consisteth in two things , that they minister unto God , and that God protecteth them , verse
GNV	Revelation	7	6	. - Revelation 7:7 Here the tribe of Levi is reckoned up in common with the rest , because all the Israelites were equally made Priests with them in Christ by his Priesthood , Rev . 1:6 , and 5:10 , and Rom . 12:1 , and
GNV	Revelation	7	8	, and also of the Gentiles , verse
GNV	Revelation	7	9	. - Revelation 7:2 Not only another , or differing in number from the common Angels of God , but also in essence , office , and operation excelling all Angels : that is , Christ Jesus the eternal Angel or word of God , and mediator of the covenant . So hereafter Rev . 8:3 and 10:1 ,
GNV	Revelation	7	10	,
GNV	Revelation	7	11	,
GNV	Revelation	7	12	. Lastly , the accomplishment of the thing is set forth unto the end of the chapter . The first verse is a transition speaking of the Angels which keep these inferior parts from all evil , until God do command . For ( as it is excellently figured by Ezek . 11:12 ) their faces and their wings are reached upwards , continually waiting upon and beholding the countenance of God for their direction : and every [ one ] of them goeth into that part that is right before his face , whithesoever the Spirit shall go , they go , they step not out of the way , that is , they depart not so much as a foot breadth from the path commanded them of God . - Revelation 7:1 On the four quarters or coasts of the earth . - Revelation 7:1 That is , neither into the air , into which the tops of trees are advanced . - Revelation 7:2 Now God provideth against the danger of his elect by commandment , verses
GNV	Revelation	7	14	And I said unto him , Lord , thou knowest . And he said unto me , [ n ] These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their long robes , and have made their long robes white in the blood of the Lamb .
GNV	Revelation	7	15	, and to come , in their perfect deliverance from all annoyances , verse
GNV	Revelation	7	49	and
GNV	Revelation	7	60	. This therefore is spoken with respect , when a certain number is put for one uncertain . Confer this with verse
GNV	Revelation	8	8	[ h ] And the second Angel blew the trumpet , and as it were a great mountain , burning with fire , was cast into the sea , and the third part of the sea became blood .

GNV	Revelation	8	1	[ a ] And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about half an hour .
GNV	Revelation	8	3	[ d ] Then another Angel came and stood before the Altar , having a golden censer , and much odors was given unto him , that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar , which is before the throne .
GNV	Revelation	8	6	. The administers of the execution are said to be seven Angels : their instruments , trumpets , whereby they should as it were sound the alarm at the commandment of God . They are propounded seven in number , because it pleased God not at once to pour out his wrath upon the rebellious world , but at divers times , and by piecemeal , and in slow order , and as with an unwilling mind to exercise his judgments upon his creatures , so long called upon both by word and signs if happily they had learned to repent . - Revelation 8:2 Which appear before him as his ministers . - Revelation 8:3 This is the great Emperor , the Lord Jesus Christ our King and Savior : who both maketh intercession to God the Father for the Saints , filling the heavenly Sanctuary with most sweet odor , and offering up their prayers , as the Calves and burnt sacrifices of their lips , in this verse : in such sort as every one of them ( so powerful is that sweet savor of Christ , and the efficacy of his sacrifice ) are held in reconcilement with God and themselves made most acceptable unto him , verse
GNV	Revelation	8	7	[ g ] So the first Angel blew the trumpet , and there was hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast into the earth , and the third part of trees was burnt , and all green grass was burnt .
GNV	Revelation	8	10	and
GNV	Revelation	8	11	. - Revelation 8:7 The first execution at the sound of the first Angel upon the earth , that is , the inhabitants of the earth ( by Metonymy ) and upon all the fruits thereof : as the comparing of this verse with the second member of verse
GNV	Revelation	8	12	[ k ] And the fourth Angel blew the trumpet , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars , so that the third part of them was darkened : and the day was smitten , that the third part of it could not shine , and likewise the night .
GNV	Revelation	8	2	[ b ] And I saw the seven Angels , which [ c ] stood before God , and to them were given seven trumpets .
GNV	Revelation	8	4	. And then also out of his treasury , and from the same sanctuary poureth forth upon the world the fire of his wrath , adding also divine tokens thereto : and by that means ( as of old the Heralds of Rome were wont to do ) he proclaimeth war against the rebellious world . - Revelation 8:4 Our prayers are nothing worth , unless that true and sweet savor of that only oblation be especially and before all things with them , that is to say , unless we being first of all justified through faith in his Son , be acceptable unto him . - Revelation 8:6 This is the work of the administers . The Angels the administers of Christ , only by sounding trumpet and voice ( for they are only as Heralds ) do effectual call forth the instruments of the wrath of God , through his power . Hitherto have been things general . Now followeth the narration of things particular , which the Angels fix in number wrought in their order set out in verse
GNV	Revelation	8	5	, and of his administers in verse
GNV	Revelation	8	9	doth not obscurely declare . - Revelation 8:8 The second execution , upon the sea in this verse and all things that are there in the next verse . - Revelation 8:10 The third execution upon the floods and fountains , that is , upon all fresh waters , in this verse : the effect whereof is , that many are destroyed with the bitterness of waters , in the verse following . - Revelation 8:11 This is spoken by Metaphor of the name of a most bitter herb , and commonly known , unless perhaps a man following those that note the derivation of words had rather expound it adjectively , for that which by reason or bitterness can not be drunk , or which maketh the liquor into which is poured more bitter than that any man can drink the same . - Revelation 8:12 The fourth execution upon these lightsome bodies of heaven , which minister unto this inferior world . - Revelation 8:13 A lamentable prediction or foretelling of those parts of the divine execution which are yet behind : which also is a passage unto the argument of the next Chapter . Of all these things in a manner Christ himself expressly foretold in Luke 12:24 , and they are common plagues generally denounced , without particular note of time . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	8	13	[ l ] And I beheld , and heard one Angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe to the inhabitants of the earth , because of the sounds to come of the trumpet of the three Angels , which were yet to blow the trumpets . Footnotes - Revelation 8:1 He returneth to the history of the seals of the book , which the Lamb openeth . The seventh seal is the next foresignification , and a precise commandment of the execution of the most heavy judgments of God upon this wicked world : which foresignification being understood by the seal , all things in heaven are silent , and in horror thorough admiration until commandment of execution be severally given of God unto the ministers of his wrath . So he passeth unto the third member of which I spake before in Rev . 6:1 , which is of the execution of those evils wherewith God most justly determined to afflict the world . - Revelation 8:2 Now followeth the third branch of the common history , as even now I said : which is the execution of the judgments of God upon the world . This is first generally prepared unto verse
GNV	Revelation	8	19	of the next chap. , and is concluded with the declaration of the event which followed upon these things done in the world , and in chapters

GNV	Revelation	9	1	And the [ a ] fifth Angel blew the trumpet , and I saw a [ b ] star fall from heaven unto the earth , [ c ] and to him was given the key of the [ d ] bottomless pit .
GNV	Revelation	9	3	. - Revelation 9:20 Now remaineth the event ( as I said upon the first verse ) which followed of so many and so grievous judgments in the most wicked world : namely an impenitent affirmation of the ungodly in their impiety and unrighteousness , though they feel themselves most vehemently pressed with the hand of God : for their obstinate ungodliness is showed in this verse : and their unrighteousness in the verse following . Hitherto hath been the general history of things to be done universal in the whole world : which because it doth not so much belong to the Church of Christ , is therefore not so expressly distinguished by certainty of time and other circumstances , but is woven , as they say with a slight hand . Also there is none other cause why the history of the seventh Angel is passed over in this place , than for that the same more properly appertaineth unto the history of the Church . But this is more diligently set out according to the time thereof , Rev .
GNV	Revelation	9	13	. Now this space is to be accounted from the end of that thousand years mentioned , Rev . 20:3 , and that is from the Popedom of that Gregory the seventh , a most monstrous Necromancer , who before was called Hildebrandus Senensis : for this man being made altogether of impiety and wickedness , as a slave of the devil , whom he served , was the most wicked firebrand of the world : he excommunicated the Emperor Henry the fourth : went about by all manner of treachery to set up and put down empires and kingdoms as liked himself : and doubted not to set Rodolph the Swedon over the Empire instead of Henry before named , sending unto him a Crown with this verse annexed unto it : Petra dedit Petro , Petrus diadema Rodolpho : that is , The Rock to Peter gave the crown , and Peter Rodolph doth renown . Finally , he so finely bestirred himself in his affairs , as he miserably set all Christendom on fire , and conveyed over unto his successors the burning brand of the same : who enraged with like ambition , never ceased to nourish that flame , and to enkindle it more and more : whereby Cities , Commonwealths , and whole kingdoms set together by the ears amongst themselves by most expert cut-throats , came to ruin , whiles they miserably wounded one another . This term of an hundred and fifty years , taketh end in the time of Gregory the ninth , or Hugolinus Anagniensis ( as he was before called ) who caused to be compiled by one Raimond his chaplain and confessor , the body of Decretals , and by sufferance of the Kings and Princes to be published in the Christian world , and established for a law . For by this sleight at length the Popes arrogated unto themselves license to kill whom they would , whiles others were unawares : and without fear established a butchery out of many of the wicked Canons of the Decretals , which the trumpet of the fifth Angel had expressly forbidden , and had hindered until this time . The effects of the bloody actions are declared upon the sixth verse : that the miserable world languishing in so great calamities , should willingly run together unto death , and prefer the same before life , by reason of the grievousness of the miseries that oppressed them . - Revelation 9:7 The form of these hellish spirits and administers , is shadowed out by signs and visible figures in this sort : that they are very expert and swift : that wheresoever they are in the world , the kingdom of theirs : that they manage all their affairs with cunning and skill , in this verse , that making show of mildness and tender affection to draw on men withal , they most impudently rage in all mischief : that they are most mighty to do hurt , Verse
GNV	Revelation	9	16	, as shall appear upon those places . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	9	20	[ q ] And the remnant of the men which were not killed by these plagues , repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils , and ( B ) idols of gold , and of silver , and of brass , and of stone , and of wood , which neither can see , neither hear , nor go .
GNV	Revelation	9	2	Pet . 2:4 ; Jude 1:6 , and of this book , Rev . 20:20 , the history of which chapter hath agreement of time with this present chapter . - Revelation 9:1 By the bottomless pit , he meaneth the deepest darkness of hell . - Revelation 9:2 Unto this is added , the smoke of the hellish and infernal spirits , all dark , and darkening all things in heaven and in earth . The spiritual darknesses are the causes of all disorder and confusion . For the devil at a time certain ( whereof the fifth verse ) sent these darknesses into his kingdom , that he might at once and with one impression overthrow all things , and pervert if it were possible the elect themselves . By this darkness all spiritual light , both active as of the Sun , and passive , as of the air which is lightened by the Sun , is taken away : and this is that which goeth before the spirits : it followeth of the spirits themselves . - Revelation 9:3 A description of the malignant spirits invading the world , taken from their nature , power , form and order . From their nature , for that they are like unto certain locusts , in quickenness , subtlety , hurtfulness , number , and such like in this verse . From their power , for that they are as the scorpions of the earth , of a secret force to do hurt . For our battle is not here with flesh and blood , but with powers , etc. , Eph . 6:12 . This place of the power of the Devils generally noted in this verse , is particularly declared afterwards in the three next verses . - Revelation 9:4 Here that power of the devils is particularly described according to their actions and effects of the same . Their actions are said to be bounded by the counsel of God : both because they hurt not all men , but only the reprobate ( for the godly and elect , in whom there is any part of a better life , God guardeth by his decree ) whom Christ shall not have sealed , in this verse : and also because they neither had all power not at all times , no not over those that are their own , but limited in manner and time , by the prescript of God , verse
GNV	Revelation	9	4	[ g ] And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree : but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
GNV	Revelation	9	5	. So their power to afflict the godly , is none , and for the wicked is limited in act and in effect by the will of God : for the manner was prescribed unto them that they should not slay , but torment the wretched world . The time is for five months or for an hundred and fifty days , that is , for so many years in which the devils have indeed mightily perverted all things in the world : and yet without that public and unpunished license of killing , which afterward they usurped when the sixth Angel had blown his trumpet , as shall be said upon verse
GNV	Revelation	9	6	( A ) Therefore in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it , and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
GNV	Revelation	9	7	[ h ] And the form of the locusts was like unto horses prepared unto the battle , and on their heads were as it were crowns , like unto gold , and their faces were like the faces of men .
GNV	Revelation	9	8	, that they are freed from being hurt of any man , as armed with the color of religion , and sacred authority of privilege , that they fill all things with horror , Verse
GNV	Revelation	9	10	. All which things are properly in the infernal powers , and communicated by them unto their ministers and vassals . - Revelation 9:11 The order of the powers of maliciousness : that they are subject to one infernal King , whom thou mayest call in English , The Destroyer : who driveth the whole world both Jews and Gentiles into the destruction that belongeth unto himself . And I can not tell whether this name belongeth unto the Etymological interpretation of Hildebrand , by a figure often used in the holy Scripture : which albeit it may otherwise be turned of the Germans ( as the sense of compound words is commonly ambiguous ) yet in very deed it signifieth as much as if thou shouldest call him the firebrand , that is , he that setteth on fire those that be faithful unto him . - Revelation 9:12 A passage unto the next point , and the history of the time following . - Revelation 9:13 The sixth execution done upon the world by the tyrannical powers thereof working in the four parts of the earth , that is in most cruel manner executing their tyrannous dominion through the whole world , and killing the miserable people without punishment , which before was not lawful for them to do in that sort , as I showed upon the fourth verse . This narration has two parts : a commandment from God , in verse
GNV	Revelation	9	11	and
GNV	Revelation	9	12	[ j ] One woe is past , and behold , yet two woes come after this .
GNV	Revelation	9	14	, and execution of the commandment , in the verse following . - Revelation 9:13 The commandment given by Christ himself , who is governor over all . - Revelation 9:13 He alludeth to the altar of incense , which stood in the Court which the Priests were in , over against the Ark of the Covenant , having a veil betwixt them . - Revelation 9:14 As if he should have said , These hitherto have been so bound by the power of God , that they could not freely run upon all men as themselves lusted , but were stayed and restrained at that great flood of Euphrates , that is , in their spiritual Babylon ( for this is a Paraphrase of the spiritual Babylon by the limits of the spiritual Babylon long since overthrown ) that they might not commit those horrible slaughters which they long breathed after . Now go to : let loose those four Angels , that is , administers of the wrath of God , in that number that is convenient to the slaughtering of the four quarters of the world : stir them up and give them the bridle , that rushing of that Babylon of theirs , which is the seat of the wicked ones , they may fly upon all the world , therein to rage , and most licentiously to exercise their tyranny , as God hath ordained . This was done when Gregory the ninth by public authority established for law his own Decretals , by which he might freely lay trains for the life of simple men . For who is it that seeth not that the laws Decretal most of them are as snares to catch souls withal ? Since that time ( O good God ! ) how great slaughters have there been ? how great massacres ? All histories are full of them : and this our age aboundeth with most horrible and monstrous examples of the same . - Revelation 9:15 The execution of the commandment is in two points : one , that those butchers are let loose , that out of their tower of the spiritual Babylon they might with fury run abroad through all the world , as well the thief of that crew which are most prompt unto all assays , in this verse : as their multitudes , both most copious , of which a number certain is named for a number infinite , Verse
GNV	Revelation	9	15	[ o ] And the four Angels were loosed , which were prepared at an hour , at a day , at a month , and at a year to slay the third part of men .
GNV	Revelation	9	17	, as being armed with fire , smoke and brimstone , as appeareth in the color of their armor , which dazzleth the eyes of all men : and have the strength of Lions to hurt withal , from which ( as out of their mouth ) the fiery , smoky , and stinking darts of the Pope are shot out , Verse
GNV	Revelation	9	18	. The other point is , that these butchers have effected the commandment of God by fraud and violence , in the two verses following . - Revelation 9:19 That is , they [ are ] harmful every way : on what part soever thou put thine hand unto them or they touch thee , they do hurt . So the former are called Scorpions , Verse
GNV	Revelation	9	19	For their power is in their mouths , and in their tails : [ p ] for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads wherewith they hurt .
GNV	Revelation	9	21	, so the word falling , is taken , Gen. 14:10 , and 24:64 , and Heb . 6:6 . - Revelation 9:1 The key was given to his star . For those powers of wickedness are thrust down into hell , and bound with chains of darkness : and are there kept unto damnation , unless God for a time do let them loose ,
GNV	Revelation	10	10	Then I took the little book out of the Angel ’ s hand , and ate it up , and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey : but when I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .

GNV	Revelation	10	2	And he had in his hand a [ c ] little book open , and he put his right foot upon the sea , and his left on the earth ,
GNV	Revelation	10	3	And cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
GNV	Revelation	10	8	[ j ] And the voice which I heard from heaven , spake unto me again , and said , Go , and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel , which standeth upon the sea , and upon the earth .
GNV	Revelation	10	1	And [ a ] I saw [ b ] another mighty Angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud , and the rainbow upon his head , and his face was as the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire .
GNV	Revelation	10	4	[ d ] And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : but I heard a voice from heaven , saying unto me , [ e ] Seal up those things which the seven thunders have spoken , and write them not .

GNV	Revelation	10	6	,
GNV	Revelation	10	7	. - Revelation 10:1 Christ Jesus , see the seventh Chapter and the second verse . - Revelation 10:2 Namely , a special book of the affairs of God ’ s Church . For the book that containeth things belonging [ unto ] the whole world , is said to be kept with the Creator , the fifth Chapter and the first verse , but the book of the Church , with the Redeemer : and out of this book is taken the rest of the history of this Apocalypse . - Revelation 10:4 A godly care is laudable , but must be joined with knowledge . Therefore nothing is to be taken in hand , but by calling : which must be expected and waiting for of the godly . - Revelation 10:4 Keep them close . - Revelation 10:5 This was a gesture used of one that sweareth , which men do nowadays use . - Revelation 10:6 Neither time itself , nor the things that are in time : but that the world to come is at hand which is altogether of eternity and beyond all times . - Revelation 10:6 There shall never be anymore time . - Revelation 10:7 Whereof Rev . 11:15 and 16:17 . - Revelation 10:8 The other part of this Chapter , concerning the particular calling of Saint John to the receiving of the prophecy following which is enjoined him , first by sign in three verses , then in plain words in the last verse . Unto the setting forth of the sign belong these things : That Saint John is taught from heaven to demand the book of the Prophecy in this verse : for these motions and desires God doth inspire : that demanding the book , he is charged to take it in a figurative manner , the use whereof also is expounded , the ninth verse , ( as in the second Chapter of Ezekiel and the ninth verse ) whence this similitude is borrowed : lastly , for that Saint John at the commandment of Christ took the book , and found by experience that the same as proceeding from Christ was most sweet , but in that it foretelleth the afflictions of the Church it was most bitter unto his spirit . - Revelation 10:11 A simple and plain declaration of the sign before going , witnessing the divine calling of S. John , and laying upon him the necessity thereof . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	10	9	So I went unto the Angel , and said to him , Give me the little book . And he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up , and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth as sweet as honey .
GNV	Revelation	10	11	[ k ] And he said unto me , Thou must prophesy again among the people and nations , and tongues , and to many Kings . Footnotes - Revelation 10:1 Now Saint John passeth unto the other Prophetical history , which is of the Church of God , as I showed that this book should be distinguished , Rev . 4:1 . This story reacheth hence unto the two and twentieth Chapter . And this whole Chapter is but a transition from the common history of the world unto that which is particular of the Church . There are in this transition or passage , two preparatives as it were , unto this Church story comprised in this whole Chapter . One is the authority of Christ revealing his mysteries , and calling his servants unto the seventh verse . The other is Saint John ’ s calling , proper unto this place , and prepared from before unto the end of this chapter . Authority is given unto this Revelation by these things : First , by the appearing from heaven in this habit and countenance , strong , ready , glorious , surveying all things by his providence and governing them by his omnipotence , the first verse . Secondly , that he brought not by chance , but out of a book , this open Revelation , set forth unto the eye , to signify the same unto the sea , and land , as the Lord over all , the second Verse . Thirdly , that he offered the same not whispering or muttering in a corner ( as false prophets do ) but crying out with a loud voice unto them which sleep , and with a lionish and terrible noise roused the secure : the very thunders themselves giving testimony thereunto , the third Verse . Lastly , for that he confirmed all by an oath , Verses
GNV	Revelation	11	11	[ v ] But after [ w ] three days and an half , [ x ] the spirit of life coming from God , shall enter into them , and they [ y ] shall stand up upon their feet : and great fear shall come upon them which saw them .

GNV	Revelation	11	1	. Extra , de penitentys & remissionibus . So by one act he committed double injury against Christ , both abolishing his truth by the restoring of the type of the Jubilee , and triumphing over his members by most wicked superstitions . O religious heart ! Now that we should understand the things of Rome , Saint John himself is the author , both after in the seventeenth Chapter almost throughout , and also in the circumscription now next following , when he saith , it is that great City ( as Rev .
GNV	Revelation	11	3	, in publishing their testimony according to their office . - Revelation 11:7 When they have done their message . - Revelation 11:7 Of which after Rev .
GNV	Revelation	11	7	. After the slaughter follow these things , that the carcasses of the godly are laid abroad , verse
GNV	Revelation	11	9	, and that therefore gratulations are publicly and privately made , verse
GNV	Revelation	11	12	and
GNV	Revelation	11	13	. That beast is the Roman Empire , made long ago of civil , Ecclesiastical : the chief head whereof was then Boniface the eighth , as I said before : who lifted up himself in so great arrogancy ( saith the author of Falsciculus temporum ) that he called himself Lord of the whole world , as well in temporal causes as in spiritual : There is an extant of that matter , written by the same Boniface most arrogantly , shall I say , or most wickedly , ca . unam sanctam , extra de majoritate & obedientia , and in the sixth of the Decretals ( which is from the same author ) many things are found of the same argument . - Revelation 11:7 He shall persecute most cruelly the holy men , and put them to death , and shall wound and pierce through with cursings both their names and writings . And that this was done to very many godly men by Boniface and others , the histories do declare , especially since the time that the odious and condemned name amongst the multitude first of the brethren Waldenses or Lugdunenses , then also of the Fratricels , was pretended , that good men might with more approbation be massacred . - Revelation 11:8 That is , openly at Rome : where at that time was a most great concourse of people , the year of Jubilee being then first ordained by Boniface unto the same end , in the year of Christ a thousand three hundred , example whereof is read , Rev .
GNV	Revelation	11	15	and
GNV	Revelation	11	18	. The sense of the acclamation is , Now the Lord is entered on his kingdom , and hath restored his Church , in which most mightily recovered from the profanation of the Gentiles , he may glorify himself . Namely , that which the Lord ordained when first he ordained his Church , that the faith of the Saints doth now behold as accomplished . - Revelation 11:16 As before , 7:11 . This giving of thanks is altogether of the same content with the words going before . - Revelation 11:18 A speech of the Hebrew language , as much to say , as Gentiles being angry thine inflamed wrath came upon them and showed itself from heaven , occasioned by their anger and fury . - Revelation 11:19 This is the confirmation of the next prophecy before going by signs exhibited in heaven , and that of two sorts , whereof some are visible , as the passing away of the heaven , the opening of the Temple , the Ark of the covenant appearing in the Temple , and testifying the glorious presence of God , and the lightning : others apprehended by ear and such dull senses which bear witness in heaven and in earth to the truth of the judgments of God . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	11	2	Cor . 2:16 . - Revelation 11:11 The third place as noted I before , is of the rising again of the Prophets from the dead , and their carrying up into heaven . For their resurrection is showed in this verse : their calling and lifting up into heaven , in the verse following . - Revelation 11:11 That is , what time God shall destroy that wicked Boniface . - Revelation 11:11 That is , the Prophets of God shall in a sort rise again , not the same in person ( as they say ) but in spirit , that is in the power and efficacy of their ministry , which S. John expressed before verses
GNV	Revelation	11	4	verses : the conflicts which the faithful must undergo in their calling , for Christ and his Church , thence unto verse
GNV	Revelation	11	5	and
GNV	Revelation	11	6	. And so the prophecy that is spoken of Elijah , is interpreted by the Angel to be understood of John the Baptist , Luke 1:17 . For the same Boniface himself , who sought to kill and destroy them , was by the fire of God ’ s mouth ( which the holy ministry showeth and exhibiteth ) devoured and died miserably in prison , by the endeavor of Satra Columensis , and Nogaretus a french knight , whom Philip the fair King of France sent into Italy but with a small power . - Revelation 11:11 That is , the most grievous heat of afflictions and persecution shall stay for a while , for the great amaze that shall arise upon that sudden and unlooked for judgment of God . - Revelation 11:12 They were called by God into heaven and taken out of this malignant world , into the heavenly Church , which also lieth hidden here in the earth , to exercise their calling secretly : as of whom this wretched world was unworthy , Heb . 11:38 . For the Church of the wicked is by comparison called the earth or the world : and the Church of the godly heaven . So in ancient time amongst the godly Israelites : so amongst the Jews in the days of Manasseh and other Kings , when the earth refused the heirs of heaven , we read that they lay hidden as heaven in the earth . - Revelation 11:12 Yet could they not hinder the secret ones of the Lord ( as the Psalmist called them , Ps 83:4 ) but they that went on forward in his work . - Revelation 11:13 Bergomensis saith , in the year of our Lord
GNV	Revelation	11	8	unto the consummation of the victory declared by voice from heaven . In this history there are three branches : a preparation by the sound of the Angels trumpet : a narration by the voice of heavenly Angels and Elders : and a confirmation by sign . - Revelation 11:15 The narration hath two parts : an acclamation of the heavenly creatures , in this verse , and both an adoration by all the Elders , verse
GNV	Revelation	11	10	. - Revelation 11:7 That is , when they have spent those thousand two hundred and sixty years , mentioned verses
GNV	Revelation	11	14	. In the calling of the servants of God are mentioned two things : the begetting and setting of the Church in two verses , and the education thereof in two verses . The begetting of the Church is here commended unto S. John by sign and by speech : the sign is a measuring rod , and the speech a commandment to measure the Temple of God , that is , to reduce the same unto a new form : because the Gentiles are already entered into the Temple of Jerusalem , and shall shortly defile and overthrow the same utterly . - Revelation 11:1 Either that of Jerusalem which was a figure of the Church of Christ , or that heavenly Example , whereof verse
GNV	Revelation	11	16	, and also a most ample thanksgiving , verses
GNV	Revelation	11	17	,
GNV	Revelation	11	19	, but the first liketh me better and the things following do agree thereunto . The sense therefore is , Thou seest all things in God ’ s house almost from the passion of Christ to be disordered : and that not only the city of Jerusalem but also the court of the Temple is trampled underfoot by the nations , and by profane men whether Jews or strangers : and that only the Temple , that is , the body of the Temple , with the Altar , and a small company of good men which truly worship God , do now remain , whom God doth sanctify and confirm by his presence . Measure therefore this , even this true Church , or rather the true type of the true Church , omitting the rest and so describe all things from me that the true Church of Christ may be as it were a very little center , and the Church of Antichrist as the circle of the center , every way in length and breadth compassing about the same , that by way of prophecy thou mayest so declare openly , that the state of the Temple of God and the faithful which worship him , that is , of the Church , is much more straight than the Church of Antichrist . - Revelation 11:2 As if he should say , it belongeth nothing unto them to judge those which are without ,
GNV	Revelation	11	20	. The first part hath two members most conveniently distributed into their times , whereof the first containeth an history of the Christian Church for
GNV	Revelation	11	1260	years , which are mentioned in this place and many others . - Revelation 11:3 I had rather translate it illud than illam , the Temple than the city : for God saith , I will give that Temple , and commit it unto my two witnesses , that is unto the Ministers of the word , who are few indeed , weak and contemptible : but yet two , that is , of such a number as one of them may help another , and one confirm the testimony of another unto all men , that from the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be made good amongst men ,
GNV	Revelation	11	1301	, this year a blazing star foretelling great calamity to come , appeared in heaven , in which year upon the feast of S. Andrew , so great an earthquake arose , as never before : which also continuing , by times , for many days , overthrew many stately houses . This saith he of the year next following the Jubilee : which S. John so many ages before , expressed word for word . - Revelation 11:13 They were indeed broken with present astonishment of mind , but did not earnestly repent as they ought to have done . - Revelation 11:13 Glorified God by confessing his name . - Revelation 11:14 He passeth unto the second history : which is the second part of this Chapter . S. John calleth these the second and third woes , having respect unto Rev . 9:12 . - Revelation 11:15 Of whose sounding the trumpet Christ expressly foretold , Rev . 10:7 , and this is the second part of this Chapter , containing a general history of the Christian Church , from the time of Boniface

See after , upon Rev . 13:1 . - Revelation 12:3 More than are the horns of the Lamb , or than the Churches are : so well furnished doth the tyrant brag himself to be , unto all manner of mischief . - Revelation 12:4 After the description of Satan followeth this action , that is , his battle offered unto the Church partly to that which is visible wherein the wheat is mingled with the chaff , and the good fish with that which is evil : a good part thereof , though in appearance it shined as the Stars shine in heaven , he is said to thrust down out of heaven and to pervert : for if it were possible he would pervert even the elect , Matt . 24:24 , and partly to the elect members of the holy Catholic Church in the second part of this verse . Many therefore of the members of this visible Church ( saith S. John ) he overthrew and triumphed upon them . - Revelation 12:4 He withstood that elect Church of the Jews which was now ready to bring forth the Christian Church , and watched for that she should bring forth . For the whole Church , and whole body is compared unto a woman : and a part of the Church unto that which is brought forth as we have noted at large upon , Cant . 7:6 . - Revelation 12:4 Christ mystical ( as they call him ) that is the whole Church , consisting of the person of Christ as the head , and of the body united thereunto by the Spirit , so is the name of Christ taken ,

GNV	Revelation	12	18	. - Revelation 12:18 That is , a most mighty tempest , that he rushed upon the whole world ( whose prince he is ) to raise the floods and provoke the nations , that they might with their furious bellows toss up and down , drive here and there , and finally destroy the Church of Christ with the holy members of the same . But the providence of God resisted his attempt , that he might favor the Church of the Gentiles , yet tender and as it were green . The rest of the story of the Dragon is excellently prosecuted by the Apostle S. John hereafter in the twentieth chapter . For here the Dragon endeavoring to do mischief , was by God cast into prison . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	12	60	years and upwards . The parts of this chapter are three . The first is , the history of the conception and bearing in womb , in
GNV	Revelation	12	1260	days , look the same place . - Revelation 12:7 Christ is the Prince of Angels , and head of the Church , who beareth that iron rod , the fifth verse . See the notes upon Daniel , Dan . 12:1 . In this verse a description of the battle and of the victory in the two verses following . The Psalmist had respect unto this battle , Ps . 68:9 , and Paul , Eph . 4:1 and Col. 2:15 . - Revelation 12:8 The description of the victory , by denying of the thing in this verse , and by affirming the contrary in the next verse . As that Satan gained nothing in heaven but was by the power of God thrown down into the world , whereof he is the prince , Christ himself and his elected members standing still by the throne of God . - Revelation 12:8 They were cast out , so that they were never seen anymore in heaven . - Revelation 12:10 The song of victory or triumph containing first , a proposition of the glory of God and of Christ showed in that victory : secondly , it containeth a reason of the same proposition taken from the effects , as that the enemy is overcome in battle in this verse , and that the godly are made conquerors ( and more than conquerors , Rom . 8:37 ) verse
GNV	Revelation	12	44	, amongst which this is very memorable , that in the feast of Pentecost , not only a great sound and noise was heard in the Temple , but also a great voice was heard of many out of the Sanctuary which cried out to all , Let us depart hence . Now three years and a half after this defection was begun of the Jews , and those wonders happened , the City was taken by force , the Temple overthrown , and the place forsaken of God : and this compass of time Saint John noted in this place . - Revelation 12:15 That is , he inflamed the Romans and the nations , that they persecuting the Jewish people with cruel arms might by the same occasion invade the Church of Christ , now departed from Jerusalem and out of Judea . For it is an usual thing in Scripture that the raging tumults of the nations , should be compared unto waters . - Revelation 12:16 That is , there was offered in their place other Jews , unto the Romans and nations raging against that people : and it came to pass thereby that the Church of God was saved whole from that violence , that most raging flood of persecution which the Dragon vomited out being altogether spent in the destruction of those other Jews . - Revelation 12:17 Being set on fire by this means , he began to be more mad , and because he perceived that his purpose against the Christian Church of the Jewish remnant was come to nought , he resolved to fall upon her seed , that is , the Church gathered also by God of the Gentiles , and the holy members of the same . And this is that other branch , as I said upon verse

GNV	Revelation	13	1	. The history of them is concluded in two points , the beginning and the manner of them . The beginning is the gift of the Dragon , who put and inspired into the beast both his impiety against God and his eminity and injustice against all men , especially against the godly and those that were of the household of faith , the fifth verse . The manner of the acts or actions done , is of two sorts both impious in mind , and blasphemous in speech against God , his Church and the godly , verse six , and also most cruel and injurious in deeds , even such as were done of most raging enemies and of most insolent and proud conquerors , the seventh verse . - Revelation 13:5 Namely his actions and manner of dealing . As concerning those two and forty months , I have spoken of them before in the twelfth Chapter and second verse . - Revelation 13:6 That is , the holy Church , the true house of the living God . - Revelation 13:6 That is , the godly in several who hid themselves from his cruelty . For this bloody beast surcharged those holy souls most falsely with innumerable accusations for the Name of Christ , as we read in Justin Martyr , Tertullian , Arnobius , Minutius , Eusebius , Augustine , and others : which example the latter times followed most diligently in destroying the flock of Christ and we in our own memory have found by experience to our incredible grief . Concerning heaven , see the eleventh Chapter and twelfth verse . - Revelation 13:8 That is , such as are not from everlasting elect in Christ Jesus . For this is that Lamb slain , of which the fifth Chapter , verse six . These words I do with Aretas distinguish in this manner : Whose names are not written even from the laying of the foundation of the world , in the book of life , of the Lamb slain . And this distinction is confirmed by a like place hereafter , Rev . 17:8 . - Revelation 13:9 The conclusion of this speech of the first beast , consisting of two parts , An exhortation to attentive audience in this verse : and a foretelling , which partly containeth threatenings against the wicked , and partly comforts for those which in patience and faith shalt wait for that glorious coming of our Lord and Savior Christ , the tenth verse . - Revelation 13:11 The second member of the vision , concerning the ecclesiastical dominion , which in Rome succeeded that which was politic , and is in the power of the corporation of false Prophets , and of the forgers of false doctrine . Wherefore the same body or corporation is called of S. John by the name of false prophet , Rev . 6:13 ,
GNV	Revelation	13	12	and third verse , that the Dragon had seven crowns set upon seven heads : because the thief announceth himself to be proper Lord and Prince of the world : but this beast is said to have ten crowns set upon several , not heads , but horns : because the beast is beholden for all unto the Dragon , verse
GNV	Revelation	13	15	[ v ] And it was permitted to him to give a [ w ] spirit unto the image of the beast , so that the image of the beast should speak , and should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
GNV	Revelation	13	2	Cor . 11:14 , and what should his honest disciples and servants do ? - Revelation 13:12 The history of the acts of this beast containeth in sum three things , hypocrisy , the witness of miracles and tyranny : of which the first is noted in this verse , the second in the
GNV	Revelation	13	3	verses following : the third in the sixteenth and seventeenth verses . His hypocrisy is most full of leasing , whereby he abuseth both the former beast and the whole world : in that albeit he hath by his cunning , as it were by lime made of the former beast a most miserable … or anatomy , usurped all his authority unto himself and most impudently exerciseth the same in the sight and view of him : yet he carrieth himself so , as if he honored him with most high honor , and did in very truth cause him to be honored of all men . - Revelation 13:12 For unto this beast of Rome , which of civil Empire is made an Ecclesiastical hierarchy , are given divine honors , and divine authority so far as he is believed to be above the Scriptures , which the gloss upon the Decretals declareth by this devilish verse , Articulos solvit , synodumque facit generalem , That is , He changeth the Articles of faith , and giveth authority to general Counsels . Which is spoken of the Papal power . So the beast is by birth , foundation , feat , and finally substance , one : only the Pope hath altered the form and manner thereof being himself the head both of that tyrannical Empire , and also of the false Prophets , for the Empire hath he taken unto himself , and thereunto hath added this cunning device . Now these words , whose deadly wound was cured are put here for distinction sake , as also sometimes afterwards : that even at that time the godly readers of this prophecy might by this sign be brought to see the things as present : as if it were said , that they might adore this very Empire that now is , whose head we have seen in our own memory to have been cut off , and to be cured again . - Revelation 13:13 The second point of the things done by the beast , is the credit of great wonders or miracles , appertaining to the strength of this impiety : of which signs some were given from above , as it is said , that fire was sent down from heaven by false sorcery , in this verse . Others were showed here below in the sight of the beast to establish idolatry , and deceive souls , which part S. John setteth forth beginning ( as they say ) at that which is last , in this manner : First the effect is declared in these words , He deceiveth the inhabitants of the earth , Secondly the common manner of working in two sorts , one of miracles . For the signs that were given him to do in the presence of the beasts : the other of the words added to the signs , and teaching the idolatry confirmed by those signs , Saying unto the inhabitants of the earth , that they should make an image unto the beasts which , etc . Thirdly , a special manner is declared : That is given unto him to put life into the image of the beast : and that such a kind of quickening , that the same both speaketh by answer unto those that ask counsel of it , and also pronounceth death against all those that do not obey nor worship it : all which things oftentimes by false miracles through the procurement and inspiration of the Devil , have been effected and wrought in images . The histories of the Papists are full of examples of such miracles , the most of them feigned , many also done by the devil in images : as of old in the serpent , Gen. 3:1 . By which examples is confirmed , not the authority of the beast , but the truth of God , and of these prophecies . - Revelation 13:14 That is , images by enallage or change of the number : for the worship of them ever since the second Council of Nice , hath been ordained in the Church by public credit , and authority contrary unto the Law of God . - Revelation 13:14 In the Greek the word is in the Dative case , as much to say , as unto the worship , honor and obeying of the beast : for by this maintenance of images this Pseudoprophetical beast doth mightily profit the beast of Rome , of whom long ago he received them . Wherefore the same is hereafter very fitly called the image of the beast , for that images have their beginning from the beast , and have their form or manner from the will of the beast , and have their end and use fixed in the profit and commodity of the beast . - Revelation 13:15 And of this miracle of the images of the beast ( that is , which the beast hath ordained to establish idolatry ) which miraculously speak and give judgment , or rather marvelously , by the fraud of the false prophets , the Papists books are full fraughted . - Revelation 13:15 To give life as Jannes and Jambres imitated the wonders that Moses wrought . - Revelation 13:16 The third place , is a most wicked and most insolent tyrrany as was said before , usurped over the persons of men in this verse : and over their goods and actions , in the next verse . For he is said , both to bring upon all persons a tyrannous servitude , that as bondslaves they might serve the beast : and also to exercise over all their goods and actions , a peddler-like abuse of indulgences and dispensations ( as they term them ) amongst their friends , and against others to use most violent interdictions , and to shoot out cursings , even in natural and civil , private and public contracts , wherein all good faith ought to have place . - Revelation 13:16 That is , their Chrism , by which in the Sacrament ( as they call it ) of Confirmation , they make servile unto themselves , the persons and doings of men , signing them in their forehead and hands : and as for the sign left by Christ ( of which Rev . 7:3 ) and the holy Sacrament of Baptism they make as void . For whom Christ hath joined unto himself by Baptism , this beast maketh challenge unto them by her greasy Chrism , which he doubteth not to prefer over Baptism , both in authority and efficacy . - Revelation 13:16 The mark of the name of the beast . - Revelation 13:17 That is , have any traffic or intercourse with men , but they only those which have this anointing and consecration of Clearkely tonsure , as they call it . Read Gratian de Consecratione , distinct . s. c. omnes , cap . Spiritus , etc . of these matters . - Revelation 13:17 Here the false Prophets do require three things , which are set down in the order of their greatness , a character , a name and the number of the name . The meaning is , that man that hath not first their anointing and clerical tonsure or shaving : secondly holy orders , by reserving whereof is communicated the same of the beast : or finally hath not attained that high degree of Pontifical knowledge , and of the Law ( as they call it ) Canonical , and hath not as it were made up in account and cast the number of the mysteries thereof : for in these things consisteth the number of that name of the beast . And this is excellently set forth in the next verse . - Revelation 13:18 That is in this number of the beast consisteth that Popish wisdom , which unto them seemeth the greatest of all others . In these words S. John expoundeth that saying which went before of the number of the beast , what it hath above his mark or acconisance and his name . These things , saith S. John , the mark and the name of the beast , do easily happen unto any man : but to have the number of the beast , is wisdom : that is , only the wise and such as have understanding , can come by that number for they must be most illuminated doctors that attain thereunto , as the words following do declare . - Revelation 13:18 How great and of what denomination this number of the beast is , by which the beast accounted his wisdom , S. John declareth in these words . Dost thou demand how great it is ? it is so great , that it occupieth the whole man : he is always learning , and never cometh to the knowledge thereof : he must be a man indeed that doth attain unto it . Askest thou of what denomination it is ? verily it standeth of six throughout and perfectly ariseth of all the parts thereof in their several denominations ( as they term them ) it standeth of six by units , tens , hundreds , etc . so as there is no one part in the learning and order Pontifical , which is not either referred unto the head , and as it were the top thereof , or contained in the same : so fitly do all things in this hierarchy agree one with another , and with their head . Therefore that cruel beast Boniface the eighth doth commend by the number of six those Decretals which he perfected , in the proem of the sixth book . Which book ( saith he ) being to be added unto five other books of the same volume of Decretals , we thought good to name Sextum the sixth : that the same volume by addition thereof containing a senary , or the number of six books ( which is a number perfect ) may yield a perfect form of managing all things , and perfect discipline of behavior . Here therefore is the number of the beast , who poureth from himself all his parts and bringeth them all back again unto himself by his discipline in most wise and cunning manner . If any man desire more of this , let him read the gloss upon that place . I am not ignorant that other interpretations are brought upon this place : but I thought it my duty , with the good favor of all and without the offense of any , to propound mine opinion in this point . And for this cause especially , for that it seemed unto me neither profitable , nor like to be true , that the number of the beast , or of the name of the beast should be taken as the common sort of interpreters do take it . For this number of the beast teacheth , giveth out , imprinteth , as a public mark of such as be his , and esteemeth that mark above all others as the mark of those whom he loveth best . Now those other expositions seem rather to be far removed from this property and condition of that number : whether you respect the name Latinus or Titan , or another . For these the beast doth not teach , nor give forth nor imprint , but most diligently forbiddeth to be taught , and audaciously denieth : he approveth not these , but reproveth them : and hateth them that think so of this number , with an hatred , greater than that of Vatinius . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	13	4	. He sitteth as God , and boasteth himself to be God . For this name of blasphemy both the Roman Emperors did then challenge unto themselves , as Suetonius and Dion do report of Caligula and Domitian : and after them the Popes of Rome did with full mouth profess the same of themselves , when they challenged unto themselves sovereignty in holy things : of which kind of sayings the sixth book of the Decretals , the Clementines , and the Extravagants , are very full . For these men were not content with that which Anglicus wrote in his Poetria ( the beginning whereof is , Papa stupor mundi . The Pope is the wonder of the world . Nec Deus es , nec homo , sed neuter es inter utrunque . Thou art not God , nay art thou man , but neuter mixed of both : as the gloss witnesseth upon the sixth book : but they were bold to take unto themselves the very name of God , and to accept it given of other : according as almost an hundred and twenty years since , there was made for Sixtus the fourth , when he should first enter into Rome in his dignity Papal , a Pageant of triumph , and cunningly fixed upon the gate of the city he should enter at , having written upon it this blasphemous verse : Oraclo vocis mundi moderaris habenas , Et merito in terris crederis esse deus . By oracle of thine own voice the world thou governest all , And worthily a God on earth , men think , and do thee call . These and six hundred the like who can impute unto that modesty whereby good men of old would have themselves called the servants of the servants of God , verily either this is a name of blasphemy , or there is none at all . - Revelation 13:2 Swift as the Leopard , easily clasping all things , as the bear doth with his foot , and tearing and devouring all things with the mouth as doth the Lion . - Revelation 13:2 That is , he lent the same unto the beast to use , when he perceived that himself could not escape , but must needs be taken by the hand of the Angel , and cast into the bottomless pit , Rev .
GNV	Revelation	13	5	[ i ] And there was given unto him a mouth , that spake great things and blasphemies , and power was given unto him , [ j ] to do two and forty months .
GNV	Revelation	13	6	And he opened his mouth unto blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his Name , [ k ] and his tabernacle , [ l ] and them that dwell in heaven .
GNV	Revelation	13	7	And it was given unto him to make war with the Saints , and to overcome them , and power was given him over every kindred , and tongue , and nation .
GNV	Revelation	13	8	. And last of all is commended the use : and the instruction of the godly against the evils that shall come from the same , verses
GNV	Revelation	13	9	,
GNV	Revelation	13	10	. - Revelation 13:1 Contrary to that which God of old commanded should be written in the head piece of the high Priest , that is , Sanctitas Jehova , Holiness unto the Lord . The name of blasphemy imposed by the Dragon , is ( as I think ) that which S. Paul saith in chapter
GNV	Revelation	13	11	[ o ] And I beheld , another beast coming out of the earth , [ p ] which had two horns like the Lamb , but he spake like the dragon .
GNV	Revelation	13	14	And deceived them that dwell on the earth by the signs which were permitted to him to do in the sight of the beast , saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make the [ t ] image of the [ u ] beast , which had the wound of a sword , and did live .
GNV	Revelation	13	16	[ x ] And he made all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive [ y ] a [ z ] mark in their right hand or in their foreheads .
GNV	Revelation	13	17	And that no man might [ aa ] buy or sell , save he that had the [ ab ] mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name .
GNV	Revelation	13	18	[ ac ] Here is wisdom . Let him that hath wit , count the number of the beast : for it is the [ ad ] number of a man , and his number is six hundred threescore and six . Footnotes - Revelation 13:1 The Apostle having declared the springing up of the Christian Church and the state of the Church from which ours taketh her beginning , doth now pass unto the story of the progress thereof , as I showed in the entrance of the former Chapter . And this history of the progress of the Church , and the battles thereof , is set down in this Chapter , but distinctly in two parts , one is of the civil Roman Empire , unto the tenth verse . Another of the body Ecclesiastical or prophetical , thence unto the end of the chapter . In the former part are showed these things : First the state of that Empire , in four verses : then the acts thereof in three verses : after the effect , which is exceeding great glory , verse
GNV	Revelation	13	20	. The form of this beast is first described in this verse , then his acts , in the verses following , and the whole speech is concluded in the last verse . This beast is by his breed a Son of the earth ( as they say ) obscurely born , and by little and little creeping up out of his abject estate . - Revelation 13:11 That is , in show he resembled the Lamb ( for what is more mild or more humble than to be the servant of the servants of God ) but in deed he played the part of the Dragon , and of the Wolf , Matt . 7:15 . For even Satan changeth himself into an Angel of light ,
GNV	Revelation	13	19	and
GNV	Revelation	14	14	¶ [ l ] And I looked , and behold , [ m ] a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sitting like unto the Son of man , [ n ] having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a [ o ] sharp sickle .

GNV	Revelation	14	1	. Of the acts and doings of Christ in overthrowing of Antichrist and his Church by the Spirit of his divine mouth : seeing that having been called back by word both publicly and privately unto his duty , and admonished of his most certain ruin : he yet ceaseth not to maintain and protect his own adherents , that they may do him service : and to afflict the godly with most barbarous persecutions . Of those things which Christ doeth , there are two kinds : one common or general in the rest of this chapter , another particular against that savage and rebellious beast and his worshippers in chapters
GNV	Revelation	14	4	,
GNV	Revelation	14	6	¶ [ d ] Then I saw [ e ] another Angel fly in the midst of heaven , having an everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation and kindred , and tongue , and people ,
GNV	Revelation	14	8	, and the fall of every one of the ungodly which worship the beast , verses
GNV	Revelation	14	9	,
GNV	Revelation	14	13	of this chapter , and his facts unto chapter
GNV	Revelation	14	16	. That common kind , is the calamity of wars spread abroad through the whole earth , and filling all things with blood , and that without respect of any person . This is figured or shadowed out in two types , of the harvest and vintage . Since the time that the light of the Gospel began to shine out , and since prophecy or preaching by the grace of God was raised up again , how horrible wars have been kindled in the world ? how much human flesh hath been thrown to the earth by this divine reaping ? how much blood ( alas for woe ) hath overflown for these hundred years almost ? all history do cry out , and this our age ( if ever before ) is now in horror , by reason of the rage of the sickle which Antichrist calleth for . In this place is the first type , that is of the harvest . - Revelation 14:14 Declaring his fierceness by his color , like unto that which is in the white or milk circle of heaven . - Revelation 14:14 As one that shall reign from God , and occupy place of Christ in this miserable execution . - Revelation 14:14 That is , a most fit and commodious instrument of Execution , destroyed all by hewing and thrusting through , for who may stand against God ? - Revelation 14:15 Christ giveth a commandment in this verse . And the Angel executeth in the next verse . - Revelation 14:17 The other type ( as I said , verse14 ) is the vintage : the manner whereof is one with that which went before , if thou except this , that the grape gathering is more exact in seeking out everything , than is the harvest labor . This is therefore a more grievous judgment , both because it succeedeth the other , and because it is understood to be executed with great diligence . - Revelation 14:20 That is , it overflowed very deep , and very far and wide : the speech is by hyperbole or excessive , to signify the greatness of the slaughter . And these be those pleasant fruits forsooth , of the contempt of Christ , and desiring of Antichrist rather than him , which the miserable , mad , and blind world doth at this time reap . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	14	18	. And this voice of the ministers of Christ hath continued since the time that Babylon ( which is Rome ) hath by deliberate counsel and manifest malice oppugned the light of the Gospel offered from God . - Revelation 14:8 Of her fornication , whereby God was provoked to wrath . - Revelation 14:9 That is , shall not worship God alone , but shall transfer his divine honor unto this beast , whether he doeth it with his heart or counterfeiting in show . For he ( saith Christ ) that denieth me before men , him will I deny before my Father , and his Angels , Matt . 10:32 . And this is that voice of the holy ministry ; which at this time is very much used of the holy and faithful servants of God . For having now sufficiently found out the public obstinacy of Babylon they labor not any longer to thunder out as against the same but to save some particular members by terror ( as S. Jude speaketh ) and to pluck them out of the public flame , or else by a vehement commiseration of their state to lead them away , they set before them eternal death , into which they rush unawares , unless in good time they return unto God , but the godly which are of their own flock , they exhort unto patience , obedience , and faith in the Lord Jesus , and charge them to give light by their good example , of good life unto others . - Revelation 14:12 The patience , sanctification and justification by faith : the consequence whereof are rest , felicity , and glory eternal , in the heavenly fellowship of God and his Angels . - Revelation 14:13 That is for the Lord . - Revelation 14:13 By works , is meant the reward which followeth good works . - Revelation 14:14 The second part of this Chapter , as I said , verse
GNV	Revelation	14	2	) do glorify the Lamb with a special song before God and his elect Angels : which song flesh and blood can not hear , nor understand , verse
GNV	Revelation	14	3	. Lastly by their deeds done before , and their sanctification in that they were virgins , pure from spiritual and bodily fornication that is , from impiety and unrighteousness , that they followed the Lamb as a guide unto all goodness , and cleaved unto him that they are holy unto him as of grace redeemed by him : that in truth and in simplicity of Christ , they have exercised all these things , sanctimony of life , the direction of the Lamb , a thankful remembrance of the redemption by him : finally ( to conclude in a word ) that they are blameless before the Lord , verses
GNV	Revelation	14	5	. - Revelation 14:6 The other part ( as I said in the first verse ) is of the acts of the Lamb , the manner whereof is delivered in two sorts , of his speech , and of his facts . His speeches are set forth unto verse
GNV	Revelation	14	7	. The overthrowing of wicked Babylon , verse
GNV	Revelation	14	10	,
GNV	Revelation	14	11	, and to come , most blessed , according to the promise of God , verse
GNV	Revelation	14	12	[ i ] Here is the patience of Saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
GNV	Revelation	14	15	and
GNV	Revelation	14	17	[ q ] Then another Angel came out of the Temple , which is in heaven , having also a sharp sickle .
GNV	Revelation	14	19	And the Angel thrust in his sharp sickle on the earth , and cut down the vines of the vineyard of the earth , and cast them into that great winepress of the wrath of God .
GNV	Revelation	14	20	And the winepress was trodden without the city , [ r ] and blood came out of the winepress , unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs . Footnotes - Revelation 14:1 The history of the Church of Christ being finished for more than a thousand and three hundred years , at which time Boniface the eighth lived as before hath been said , there remaineth the rest of the history of the conflicting or militant Church , from thence unto the time of the last victory in three chapters . For first of all , as the foundation of the whole history , is described the standing of the lamb with his army and retinue in five verses , after his worthy acts which he hath done , and yet doth in most mighty manner , whilst he overthroweth Antichrist with the spirit of his mouth , in the rest of this chapter , and in the two following . Unto the description of the Lamb , are propounded three things : his situation , place and attendance : for the rest are expounded in the former visions , especially upon the fifth chapter . - Revelation 14:1 As ready girt to do his office ( as Acts 6:56 ) in the midst of the Church which aforetime mount Zion did prefigure . - Revelation 14:1 As before 7:2 . This retinue of the Lamb is described first by divine mark ( as before 7:2 ) in this verse . Then by divine occupation , in that all and every one in his retinue most vehemently and sweetly ( verse

GNV	Revelation	15	1	And [ a ] I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvelous , seven [ b ] Angels having the seven last plagues : for by them is fulfilled the wrath of God .
GNV	Revelation	15	3	And they sung [ g ] the song of Moses the [ h ] servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , [ i ] Great and marvelous are thy works , Lord God Almighty : just and true are thy ( A ) [ j ] ways , King of Saints .
GNV	Revelation	15	6	. Thirdly , they are furnished with instruments of the judgments of God , and weapons fit for the manner of the same judgments , verse
GNV	Revelation	15	7	. Finally they are confirmed by testimony of the visible glory of God , in the last verse . A like testimony whereunto was exhibited of old in the Law , Exod . 40:34 . - Revelation 15:6 That is , commandments to inflict those seven plagues . Here is the figure called Metonymy . - Revelation 15:6 Which was in old time a sign of the kingly or princely dignity . - Revelation 15:6 That is , girding was a sign of diligence , and the girdle of gold was a sign of sincerity and trustiness in taking in charge the commandments of God . - Revelation 15:7 Of these before , Rev . 4:7 . - Revelation 15:8 None of those seven Angels might resume , till he had performed fully the charge committed unto him according to the decree of God .

GNV	Revelation	15	2	) wherein first the authority of the whole argument and matter thereof is figured by a forerunning type of a temple opened in heaven , as Rev . 11:19 , namely that all those things are divine and of God , that proceed from thence , in this verse . Secondly , the administers or executors , come forth out of the Temple , verse
GNV	Revelation	15	4	other verses . - Revelation 15:2 This part of the vision alludeth unto the sea or large vessel of brass in which the Priests washed themselves in the entrance of the Temple : for in the entrance of the heavenly Temple ( as it is called , verse
GNV	Revelation	15	5	) is said to have been a sea of glass , most lightsome and clear , unto the commodity of choice mixed with fire , that is , as containing the treasury of the judgments of God , which he bringeth forth and dispenseth according to his own pleasure : for out of the former , the Priests were cleansed of old and out of this the ungodly are destroyed now , Rev . 4:6 . - Revelation 15:2 That is , the Godly martyrs of Christ , who shall not give place even in miracles unto that beast : of these , see before , Rev . 13:17 and 14:9 ,
GNV	Revelation	15	8	And the temple was full of the smoke of the glory of God and of his power , and [ p ] no man was able to enter into the Temple , till the seven plagues of the seven Angels were fulfilled . Footnotes - Revelation 15:1 This is that other place of the acts of Christ , as I noted before , 14:14 . Now therefore is showed a singular work of the judgment of God belonging to the overthrow of Antichrist and his forces of which divine work the preparation is described in this Chapter and the execution in the next . The preparation is first set down generally and in type in this verse : and is after particularly set forth in the rest of the Chapter . - Revelation 15:1 Of which Rev . 8:9 , in pouring forth in the plagues of the world : for even these plagues do for the most part agree with those . - Revelation 15:2 There are two parts of the narration : one the confession of the Saints glorifying God , when they saw that preparation of the judgments of God , unto verse

GNV	Revelation	16	2	Chron . 37:22 ; Zech . 12:11 . In this mountain country God saith by figure and type , that the kings of the peoples which serve the beast shall meet together : because the Gentiles did always cast that lamentable overthrow in the teeth of the Church of the Jews unto their great reproach : and therefore were persuaded that that place should be most fortunate unto them ( as they speak ) and unfortunate unto the godly : but God here pronounceth , that that reproach of the Church , and confidence of the ungodly shall by himself be taken away , in the selfsame places where the nations persuaded themselves , they should mightily exult and triumph against God and his Church . - Revelation 16:17 The story of the seventh Angel unto the end of the chapter , in which first is showed by figure and speech , the argument of this plague , in this verse : and then is declared the execution thereof in the verses following . - Revelation 16:17 From whence he might move the heaven above and the earth beneath . - Revelation 16:17 That is , from him that sitteth on the throne , by the figure called Metonymy . - Revelation 16:17 That is , Babylon is undone , as is showed verse

A borrowed Hebraism . - Revelation 16:20 Appeared not , which the Hebrews utter after this sort , were not , Gen. 5:24 . - Revelation 16:21 The manner of the particular execution , most evidently testifying the wrath of God by the original and greatness thereof : the event whereof is the same with that which is , Rev . 9:12 , and that which hath been mentioned in this Chapter , from the execution of the fourth Angel hitherto , that is to say , an incorrigible pertinency of the world in their rebellion , and an heart that can not repent , verses
GNV	Revelation	16	4	[ f ] And the third Angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters , and they became blood .
GNV	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the Angel of the waters say , Lord , thou art just , which art , and which wast : and Holy , because thou hast judged these things .

GNV	Revelation	17	1	. The narration of the vision , promised in this verse , and delivered in the verse following . Now there is delivered first a narration of the beast and his story , unto verse
GNV	Revelation	17	2	,
GNV	Revelation	17	6	. The beast in process of time hath gotten somewhat more than was expressed in the former vision . First in that it is not read before that he was appareled in scarlet , a robe imperial and of triumph . Secondly , in that this is full of names of blasphemy : the other carried the name of blasphemy only in his head . So God did teach that this beast is much increased in impiety and injustice and doth in this last age , triumph in both these more insolently and proudly than ever before . - Revelation 17:3 A scarlet color , that is , with a red and purple garment : and surely it was not without cause that the Romish clergy were so much delighted with this color . - Revelation 17:4 That harlot , the spiritual Babylon , which is Rome . She is described by her attire , profession and deeds . - Revelation 17:4 In attire most glorious , triumphant , most rich , and most gorgeous . - Revelation 17:4 In profession , the nourisher of all , in this verse , and teaching her mysteries unto all , verse
GNV	Revelation	17	7	, belonging unto the harlot , showed in the vision , verse
GNV	Revelation	17	11	. And here it is worthy to be observed , that one type hath sometimes two or more applications , as seemeth good unto the holy Ghost to express either one thing by divers types , or divers things by one type . So I noted before , of the seven spirits , Rev . 1:4 . Now this woman that sitteth upon seven hills , is the city of Rome , called in times past of the Greeks , … i. of seven tops or crests , and of Varro , septiceps , i. of her seven heads ( as here ) of seven heads , and of others , septicollis , i. standing upon seven hills . - Revelation 17:9 The beginning of these Kings or Emperors is almost the same with the beginning of the Church of Christ , which I showed before , Rev . 11:1 . Namely from the year
GNV	Revelation	17	14	. For as these being blinded have before depended upon the beck of the beast that lifteth up the harlot , so it is said that afterward it shall come to pass , that they shall turn back , and shall fall away from her when their hearts shall be turned into better state by the grace and mercy of God . - Revelation 17:18 That is , Rome that great City , or only City ( as Justinian calleth it ) the King and head whereof was then the Emperor , but now the Pope , since that the condition of the beast was changed . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	17	3	things are distinctly propounded , what is her magnificence in this verse , what is her fall , and by whom it shall happen unto her , in the two verses following : and lastly , who that harlot is , in the last verse . This place which by order of nature should have been the first , is therefore made the last , because it was more fit to be joined with the next Chap . - Revelation 17:15 That is , as unconstant and variable as the waters . Upon this foundation sitteth this harlot as Queen , a vain person upon that which is vain . - Revelation 17:16 The ten Kings as verse
GNV	Revelation	17	4	,
GNV	Revelation	17	5	adversus hareses . - Revelation 17:10 Nerua . The Empire being now translated from the family of Flavius . This man reigned only one year , four months , and nine days , as the history writers do tell . - Revelation 17:11 This is spoken by the figure synecdoche , as much to say as that head of the beast which was and is not , because it is cut off , and Nerua in so short time extinguished . How many heads there were , so many beasts there seemed to be in one . See the like speech in Rev . 13.3 - Revelation 17:11 Nerua Traianus , who himself in divers respects is called here the seventh and the eighth . - Revelation 17:11 Though in number and order of succession he be the eighth , yet he is reckoned together with one of these heads , because Nerua and he were one head . For this man obtained authority together with Nerua , and was Consul with him , when Nerua left his life . - Revelation 17:11 Namely , to molest with persecutions the Churches of Christ , as the histories do accord , and I have briefly noted , Rev . 2:10 . - Revelation 17:12 The third place of this description as I said , verse
GNV	Revelation	17	8	[ n ] The beast that thou hast seen , [ o ] was and is not , and [ p ] shall ascend out of the bottomless pit , and shall go into perdition , and they that dwell on the earth , shall wonder ( whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world ) [ q ] when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
GNV	Revelation	17	9	[ r ] Here is the mind that hath wisdom , The [ s ] seven heads [ t ] are seven mountains , whereon the woman sitteth : [ u ] they are also seven Kings .
GNV	Revelation	17	10	,
GNV	Revelation	17	12	. The accomplishment of this fact and event , is daily increased in this our age by the singular providence and most mighty government of God . Wherefore the facts are propounded in this verse , and the cause of them in the verses following . - Revelation 17:17 A reason rendered from the chief efficient cause , which is the providence of God , by which alone S. John by inversion of order affirmeth to have come to pass , both that the Kings should execute upon the harlot , that which pleased God , and which he declared in the verse next beforegoing : and also that by one consent and counsel , they should give their kingdom unto the beast , etc. , verses
GNV	Revelation	17	13	,
GNV	Revelation	17	15	[ ah ] And he said unto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , [ ai ] are people , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
GNV	Revelation	17	16	And the ten [ aj ] horns which thou sawest upon the beast , are they that shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate , and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
GNV	Revelation	17	18	, is a prophetical prediction of things to come which the beast should do , as in the words following S. John doth not obscurely signify , saying , which have not yet received the kingdom , etc . For there is an Antithesis or opposition between these kings , and those that went before . And first the persons are described , in this verse , then their deeds in the two verses following . - Revelation 17:12 That is , arising with their kingdoms out of the Roman beast : at such time as that political Empire began by the craft of the Popes greatly to fall . - Revelation 17:12 Namely , with the second beast whom we called before a false prophet , which beast , ascending out of the earth got unto himself all the authority and power of the first beast , and exerciseth the same before his face , as was said , Rev . 14:11 ,
GNV	Revelation	17	19	. And lastly of the Dragon , chap .
GNV	Revelation	17	20	, in the story of the spiritual Babylon are distinctly set forth the state thereof in this chap . and the overthrow done from God , chap .
GNV	Revelation	17	35	, after the passion of Christ , what time the Temple and Church of the Jews was overthrown . In which year it came to pass by the providence of God that that saying The beast was and is not , was fulfilled before that the destruction of the Jews immediately following came to pass . That was the year from the building of the city of Rome ,
GNV	Revelation	17	109	, from which year S. John both numbered the Emperors which hitherto hath been , when he wrote these things , and foretelleth two others next to come : and that with this purpose , that when this particular prediction of foretelling of things to come , should take effect the truth of all other predictions in the Church might be the more confirmed . Which sign God of old mentioned this in the Law , Deut .
GNV	Revelation	18	18	. In every [ one ] of these the cause and manner of their mourning is described in order , according to the condition of those [ that ] mourn , with observation of that which best agreeth unto them . - Revelation 18:11 The lamentation of those that trade by land , as I distinguished immediately before . - Revelation 18:14 An apostrophe , or turning of the speech by imitation , used for more vehemence , as if those merchants , after the manner of mourners should in passionate speech speak unto Babylon , though now utterly fallen and overthrown . So Isa . 12:9 , and in many other places . - Revelation 18:14 By this is meant that season which is next before the fall of the leaf , at what season fruits ripen , and the word signifieth such fruits as are longed for . - Revelation 18:17 The manner of mourning used by them that trade by sea . - Revelation 18:20 The other consequent unto the other ruin of Babylon , is the exultation or rejoicing of the godly in heaven and in earth , as was noted , verse

GNV	Revelation	18	2	sorts , first by a simple propounding of the thing itself , in this verse , and then by declaration of the events in the verses following . - Revelation 18:22 The events are two , the one of them opposite unto the other for amplification sake . There shall be , saith he , in Babylon no mirth nor joy at all , in this and the next verse , but all heavy and lamentable things from the bloody slaughters of the righteous and the vengeance of God coming upon it for the same . - Revelation 18:24 That is shed by bloody massacres , and calling for vengeance . - Revelation 18:24 That is , proved and found out , as if God had appointed a just inquiry , concerning the impiety , unnaturalness and injustice of those men . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	18	11	[ n ] And the merchants of the earth shall weep and wail over her : for no man buyeth their ware anymore .
GNV	Revelation	18	16	,
GNV	Revelation	18	20	. This most sorrowful lamentation , according to the person of them that lament , hath three members , the first whereof is the mourning of the kings and mighty men of the earth , in two verses . The second is the lamentation of the merchants that traffic by land thence unto verse
GNV	Revelation	18	1	, standing of a sign , and the interpretation thereof : the interpretation thereof is in
GNV	Revelation	18	3	For all nations have drunken of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich of the abundance of her pleasures .
GNV	Revelation	18	4	) are two . Namely the lamentation of the wicked unto verse
GNV	Revelation	18	5	For her sins are [ g ] come up into heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
GNV	Revelation	18	6	,
GNV	Revelation	18	7	, and her most just damnation by the sentence of God , verse
GNV	Revelation	18	8	. - Revelation 18:7 With herself . - Revelation 18:7 I am full of people and mighty . - Revelation 18:7 I shall taste of none . - Revelation 18:8 Shortly and at one instant . - Revelation 18:9 The circumstances following the fall of Babylon , or the consequences thereof ( as I distinguished them , verse
GNV	Revelation	18	9	. - Revelation 18:21 The third prediction , as I said verse
GNV	Revelation	18	10	And shall stand afar off for fear of her torment , saying , Alas , alas , that great city Babylon , that mighty city : for in one hour is thy judgment come .
GNV	Revelation	18	12	, to have been done in time past , before the destruction of Jerusalem : this charge is given here , and in the next verse . The other is , that every one of them occupy themselves in their own place , in executing the judgment of God , as it was commanded the Levites of old , Exod . 32:27 , and that they sanctify their hands unto the Lord , verses
GNV	Revelation	18	13	And of cinnamon , and odors , and ointments , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and beasts , and sheep , and horses , and chariots , and servants , and souls of men .
GNV	Revelation	18	14	( [ o ] And the [ p ] apples that thy soul lusted after , are departed from thee , and all things which were fat and excellent , are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more . )
GNV	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things which were waxed rich , shall stand afar off from her , for fear of her torment , weeping and wailing .
GNV	Revelation	18	17	,
GNV	Revelation	18	19	: and the rejoicing of the godly , verse
GNV	Revelation	18	21	[ s ] Then a mighty Angel took up a stone , like a great millstone , ( B ) and cast it into the sea , saying , With such violence shall that great city Babylon be cast and shall be found no more .
GNV	Revelation	18	22	[ t ] And the voice of harpers , and musicians and of pipers , and trumpeters shall be heard no more in thee , and no craftsman , of whosoever craft he be , shall be found anymore in thee : and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more in thee .
GNV	Revelation	18	23	And the light of a candle shall shine no more in thee : and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth : and with thine enchantment were deceived all nations .
GNV	Revelation	18	24	And in her was found the [ u ] blood of the Prophets [ v ] and of the Saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth . Footnotes - Revelation 18:1 The second place ( as I said before , 17:1 ) of the history of Babylon , is of the woeful fall and ruin of that whore of Babylon . This historical prediction concerning her , is threefold . The first a plain and simple foretelling of her ruin in three verses , the second a figurative prediction by the circumstances , thence , unto verse
GNV	Revelation	19	19	. - Revelation 19:5 The second place of praise as I said verse

GNV	Revelation	19	1	) is of the victory gotten by Christ against both the beasts : in which first Christ is described as one ready to fight , unto verse
GNV	Revelation	19	9	. - Revelation 19:5 Out of the temple from God , as Rev . 11:19 . - Revelation 19:6 Without the Temple in heaven . - Revelation 19:7 Namely unto that holy marriage both herself in person in this verse and also furnished of her spouse with marriage gifts princely and divine is adorned and prepared in the next verse . - Revelation 19:8 As an ensign of Kingly and priestly dignity : which dignity Christ bestoweth upon us , Rev . 1:6 . - Revelation 19:8 This is a gift given by the husband for marriage sake and a most choice ornament , which Christ bestoweth upon us , as upon his spouse . - Revelation 19:8 Good works which are lively testimonies of faith . - Revelation 19:9 Namely the Angel , as appeareth by the next verse . - Revelation 19:10 The particular history of this verse is brought in by occasion , and as it were besides the purpose , that Saint John might make a public example of his own infirmity , and of the modest sanctimony of the Angel , who hath renounced for himself the divine honors , and recalled all the servants of God , unto the worship of him alone : as also Rev . 22:8 . - Revelation 19:10 Which are commanded to bear witness of Jesus . - Revelation 19:10 For Jesus is the mark that all the prophecies shoot at . - Revelation 19:11 The second place of this Chapter ( as I said verse
GNV	Revelation	19	10	, another historical of the victory of Christ gotten against both the beasts unto the end of the chapter , which I said was the second history of this argument , Rev . 17:1 . The transition hath two places , one of praising God for the overthrow done unto Babylon in
GNV	Revelation	19	11	) of the victory obtained by Christ . Unto this apppertaineth two things : his bucking with the beast and his forces in this verse : and the event most magnificent , described after the manner of men , in the verses following .

See also Rev . 16:14 . Geneva Bible ,
GNV	Revelation	19	20	But the beast [ y ] was taken , and with him [ z ] that false Prophet that wrought miracles before him , whereby he deceived them that received the beast ’ s mark , and them that worshipped his image . These both were alive cast into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
GNV	Revelation	19	2	Sam . 12:11 . - Revelation 19:17 That is , through this inferior heaven , and which is nearer unto us : a Hebrew phrase . - Revelation 19:19 The third member ( as was said , verse
GNV	Revelation	19	3	And again they said , [ d ] Hallelujah : and that her smoke rose up for evermore .
GNV	Revelation	19	4	verses , and another likewise of praise , and Prophetical , for the coming of Christ unto his kingdom , and his most royal marriage with his Church , thence unto the tenth verse . The former praise has three branches , distinguished after the ancient manner of those that sing : … , that is , an invitation or provokement in
GNV	Revelation	19	5	[ e ] Then a voice came out of the [ f ] throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
GNV	Revelation	19	6	, also because they see that the Church is called forth to be brought home : into the house of her husband by holy marriage unto the fellowship of his kingdom , verses

GNV	Revelation	19	14	[ r ] And the hosts which were in heaven , followed him upon white horses , clothed with fine linen white and pure .
GNV	Revelation	19	15	[ s ] And out of his mouth went out a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the heathen : for he shall ( C ) rule them with a rod of iron , for he it is that treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
GNV	Revelation	19	16	, then is showed the battle to be begun , thence unto verse
GNV	Revelation	19	17	[ u ] And I saw an Angel stand in the [ v ] sun who cried with a loud voice , saying , to all the fowls that did fly by [ w ] the midst of heaven , come , and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ,
GNV	Revelation	19	18	: lastly is set forth the victory unto the end of the Chapter . In this place do shine most excellent properties of Christ as our heavenly Judge and revenger , according to his person , company , effects , and names . - Revelation 19:11 Properties belonging to his person , that he is heavenly , judge , faithful , true , just , in this verse , searching out all things ruling over all , to be searched out of none , verse

Footnotes - Revelation 19:1 This chapter hath in sum two parts , one transitory or of passage unto the things that follow unto verse

Footnotes - Revelation 20:1 Now followeth the third place of the prophetical history , which is of the victory whereby Christ overcame the dragon , as I note , Rev . 7:1 .
