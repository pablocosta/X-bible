AMPC	Matthew	1	11	And Josiah became the father of Jeconiah [ also called Coniah and Jehoiachin ] and his brothers about the time of the removal ( deportation ) to Babylon . ( C )

AMPC	Matthew	1	20	But as he was thinking this over , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , descendant of David , do not be afraid to take Mary [ as ] your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of ( from , out of ) the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Matthew	1	21	She will bear a Son , and you shall call His name Jesus [ the Greek form of the Hebrew Joshua , which means Savior ] , for He will save His people from their sins [ that is , prevent them from [ a ] failing and missing the true end and scope of life , which is God ] .

AMPC	Matthew	1	23	Behold , the virgin shall become pregnant and give birth to a Son , and they shall call His name Emmanuel—which , when translated , means , God with us . ( D )

AMPC	Matthew	2	2	Where is He Who has been born King of the Jews ? For we have seen His star in the east [ a ] at its rising and have come to worship Him . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	2	3	When Herod the king heard this , he was disturbed and troubled , and the whole of Jerusalem with him .
AMPC	Matthew	2	4	So he called together all the chief priests and learned men ( scribes ) of the people and [ b ] anxiously asked them where the Christ was to be born .
AMPC	Matthew	2	5	They replied to him , In Bethlehem of Judea , for so it is written by the prophet :
AMPC	Matthew	2	6	And you Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , you are not in any way least or insignificant among the [ c ] chief cities of Judah ; for from you shall come a Ruler ( [ d ] Leader ) Who will govern and [ e ] shepherd My people Israel . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod sent for the wise men [ astrologers ] secretly , and [ f ] accurately to the last point ascertained from them the time of the appearing of the star [ that is , [ g ] how long the star had made itself visible since its rising in the east ] .
AMPC	Matthew	2	8	Then he sent them to Bethlehem , saying , Go and search for the Child carefully and diligently , and when you have found [ h ] Him , bring me word , that I too may come and worship Him .
AMPC	Matthew	2	9	When they had listened to the king , they went their way , and behold , the star which had been seen in the east [ i ] in its rising went before them until it came and stood over the place where the young Child was .
AMPC	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they were thrilled with ecstatic joy .
AMPC	Matthew	2	11	And on going into the house , they saw the Child with Mary His mother , and they fell down and worshiped Him . Then opening their treasure bags , they presented to Him gifts—gold and frankincense and myrrh .
AMPC	Matthew	2	12	And [ j ] receiving an answer to their asking , they were divinely instructed and warned in a dream not to go back to Herod ; so they departed to their own country by a different way .
AMPC	Matthew	2	13	Now after they had gone , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said , Get up ! [ [ k ] Tenderly ] take unto you the young Child and His mother and flee to Egypt ; and remain there till I tell you [ otherwise ] , for Herod intends to search for the Child in order to destroy Him .
AMPC	Matthew	2	14	And having risen , he took the Child and His mother by night and withdrew to Egypt
AMPC	Matthew	2	15	And remained there until Herod ’ s death . This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet , Out of Egypt have I called My Son . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , when he realized that he had been misled by the wise men , was furiously enraged , and he sent and put to death all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that territory who were two years old and under , reckoning according to the date which he had investigated diligently and had learned exactly from the wise men .
AMPC	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah :
AMPC	Matthew	2	18	A voice was heard in Ramah , wailing and loud lamentation , Rachel weeping for her children ; she refused to be comforted , because they were no more . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod died , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
AMPC	Matthew	2	20	And said , Rise , [ [ l ] tenderly ] take unto you the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel , for those who sought the Child ’ s life are dead .
AMPC	Matthew	2	21	Then he awoke and arose and [ [ m ] tenderly ] took the Child and His mother and came into the land of Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	2	22	But because he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in the place of his father Herod , he was afraid to go there . And being divinely warned in a dream , he withdrew to the region of Galilee .
AMPC	Matthew	2	23	He went and dwelt in a town called Nazareth , so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled : He shall be called a Nazarene [ Branch , Separated One ] .

AMPC	Matthew	3	3	This is he who was mentioned by the prophet Isaiah when he said , The voice of one crying in the wilderness ( shouting in the desert ) , Prepare the road for the Lord , make His highways straight ( level , [ b ] direct ) . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	3	2	And saying , Repent ( [ a ] think differently ; change your mind , regretting your sins and changing your conduct ) , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
AMPC	Matthew	3	4	This same John ’ s garments were made of camel ’ s hair , and he wore a leather girdle about his waist ; and his food was locusts and wild honey . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	3	5	Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country round about the Jordan went out to him ;
AMPC	Matthew	3	6	And they were baptized in the Jordan by him , confessing their sins .
AMPC	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism , he said to them , You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee and escape from the wrath and indignation [ of God against disobedience ] that is coming ?
AMPC	Matthew	3	8	Bring forth fruit that is consistent with repentance [ let your lives prove your change of heart ] ;
AMPC	Matthew	3	9	And do not presume to say to yourselves , We have Abraham for our forefather ; for I tell you , God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones !
AMPC	Matthew	3	10	And already the ax is lying at the root of the trees ; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
AMPC	Matthew	3	11	I indeed baptize you [ c ] in ( with ) water [ d ] because of repentance [ that is , because of your [ e ] changing your minds for the better , heartily amending your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ] . But He Who is coming after me is mightier than I , Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to take off or carry ; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
AMPC	Matthew	3	12	His winnowing fan ( shovel , fork ) is in His hand , and He will thoroughly clear out and clean His threshing floor and gather and store His wheat in His barn , but the chaff He will burn up with fire that can not be put out .
AMPC	Matthew	3	13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him .
AMPC	Matthew	3	14	But John [ f ] protested strenuously , having in mind to prevent Him , saying , It is I who have need to be baptized by You , and do You come to me ?
AMPC	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus replied to him , [ g ] Permit it just now ; for this is the fitting way for [ both of ] us to fulfill all righteousness [ that is , to [ h ] perform completely whatever is right ] . Then he permitted Him .
AMPC	Matthew	3	16	And when Jesus was baptized , He went up at once out of the water ; and behold , the heavens were opened , and he [ John ] saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on Him .
AMPC	Matthew	3	17	And behold , a voice from heaven said , This is My Son , My Beloved , in Whom I delight ! ( C ) Footnotes - Matthew 3:2 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Matthew 3:3 G.

AMPC	Matthew	4	4	But He replied , It has been written , Man shall not live and be upheld and sustained by bread alone , but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	4	2	And He went without food for forty days and forty nights , and later He was hungry . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	4	3	And the tempter came and said to Him , If You are God ’ s Son , command these stones to be made [ [ a ] loaves of ] bread .
AMPC	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil took Him into the holy city and placed Him on [ b ] a turret ( pinnacle , [ c ] gable ) of the temple [ d ] sanctuary . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	4	6	And he said to Him , If You are the Son of God , throw Yourself down ; for it is written , He will give His angels charge over you , and they will bear you up on their hands , lest you strike your foot against a stone . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him , [ e ] On the other hand , it is written also , You shall not tempt , [ f ] test thoroughly , or [ g ] try exceedingly the Lord your God . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	4	8	Again , the devil took Him up on a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory ( the splendor , magnificence , preeminence , and excellence ) of them .
AMPC	Matthew	4	9	And he said to Him , These things , all taken together , I will give You , if You will prostrate Yourself before me and do homage and worship me .
AMPC	Matthew	4	10	Then Jesus said to him , Begone , Satan ! For it has been written , You shall worship the Lord your God , and Him alone shall you serve . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil departed from Him , and behold , angels came and ministered to Him .
AMPC	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested and put in prison , He withdrew into Galilee .
AMPC	Matthew	4	13	And leaving Nazareth , He went and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea , in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali—
AMPC	Matthew	4	14	That what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be brought to pass :
AMPC	Matthew	4	15	The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , in the [ h ] way to the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles [ of the [ i ] peoples who are not of Israel ] — ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	4	16	The people who sat [ j ] ( dwelt enveloped ) in darkness have seen a great Light , and for those who sat in the land and shadow of death Light has dawned .
AMPC	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach , [ k ] crying out , Repent ( [ l ] change your mind for the better , heartily amend your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ) , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
AMPC	Matthew	4	18	As He was walking by the Sea of Galilee , He noticed two brothers , Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother , throwing a dragnet into the sea , for they were fishermen .
AMPC	Matthew	4	19	And He said to them , Come [ m ] after Me [ as disciples—letting Me be your Guide ] , follow Me , and I will make you fishers of men !
AMPC	Matthew	4	20	At once they left their nets and [ n ] became His disciples [ sided with His party and followed Him ] .
AMPC	Matthew	4	21	And going on further from there He noticed two other brothers , James son of Zebedee and his brother John , in the boat with their father Zebedee , mending their nets and putting them right ; and He called them .
AMPC	Matthew	4	22	At once they left the boat and their father and [ o ] joined Jesus as disciples [ sided with His party and followed Him ] .
AMPC	Matthew	4	23	And He went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news ( Gospel ) of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every weakness and infirmity among the people .
AMPC	Matthew	4	24	So the report of Him spread throughout all Syria , and they brought Him all who were sick , those afflicted with various diseases and torments , those under the power of demons , and epileptics , and paralyzed people , and He healed them .
AMPC	Matthew	4	25	And great crowds joined and accompanied Him about , coming from Galilee and Decapolis [ the district of the ten cities east of the Sea of Galilee ] and Jerusalem and Judea and from the other [ the east ] side of the Jordan .

AMPC	Matthew	5	5	Blessed ( happy , blithesome , joyous , [ e ] spiritually prosperous— [ f ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the meek ( the mild , patient , long-suffering ) , for they shall inherit the earth ! ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	5	2	Then He opened His mouth and taught them , saying :
AMPC	Matthew	5	3	Blessed ( happy , [ a ] to be envied , and [ b ] spiritually prosperous— [ c ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the poor in spirit ( the humble , who rate themselves insignificant ) , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven !
AMPC	Matthew	5	4	Blessed and enviably happy [ with a [ d ] happiness produced by the experience of God ’ s favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His matchless grace ] are those who mourn , for they shall be comforted ! ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	5	6	Blessed and fortunate and happy and [ g ] spiritually prosperous ( in that state in which the born-again child of God [ h ] enjoys His favor and salvation ) are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness ( uprightness and right standing with God ) , for they shall be [ i ] completely satisfied ! ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	5	7	Blessed ( happy , [ j ] to be envied , and [ k ] spiritually prosperous— [ l ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy !
AMPC	Matthew	5	8	Blessed ( happy , [ m ] enviably fortunate , and [ n ] spiritually prosperous—possessing the [ o ] happiness produced by the experience of God ’ s favor and especially conditioned by the revelation of His grace , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the pure in heart , for they shall see God ! ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	5	9	Blessed ( enjoying [ p ] enviable happiness , [ q ] spiritually prosperous— [ r ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of their outward conditions ) are the makers and [ s ] maintainers of peace , for they shall be called the sons of God !
AMPC	Matthew	5	10	Blessed and happy and [ t ] enviably fortunate and [ u ] spiritually prosperous [ v ] ( in the state in which the born-again child of God enjoys and finds satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of his outward conditions ) are those who are persecuted for righteousness ’ sake ( for being and doing right ) , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven !
AMPC	Matthew	5	11	Blessed ( happy , [ w ] to be envied , and [ x ] spiritually prosperous— [ y ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of your outward conditions ) are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you falsely on My account .
AMPC	Matthew	5	12	Be glad and supremely joyful , for your reward in heaven is great ( strong and intense ) , for in this same way people persecuted the prophets who were before you . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	5	13	You are the salt of the earth , but if salt has lost its taste ( its strength , its quality ) , how can its saltness be restored ? It is not good for anything any longer but to be thrown out and trodden underfoot by men .
AMPC	Matthew	5	14	You are the light of the world . A city set on a hill can not be hidden .
AMPC	Matthew	5	15	Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a peck measure , but on a lampstand , and it gives light to all in the house .
AMPC	Matthew	5	16	Let your light so shine before men that they may see your [ z ] moral excellence and your praiseworthy , noble , and good deeds and [ aa ] recognize and honor and praise and glorify your Father Who is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	5	17	Do not think that I have come to do away with or [ ab ] undo the Law or the Prophets ; I have come not to do away with or undo but to complete and fulfill them .
AMPC	Matthew	5	18	For truly I tell you , until the sky and earth pass away and perish , not one smallest letter nor one little hook [ identifying certain Hebrew letters ] will pass from the Law until all things [ it foreshadows ] are accomplished .
AMPC	Matthew	5	19	Whoever then breaks or does away with or relaxes one of the least [ important ] of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least [ important ] in the kingdom of heaven , but he who practices them and teaches others to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	5	20	For I tell you , unless your righteousness ( your uprightness and your right standing with God ) is more than that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	5	21	You have heard that it was said to the men of old , You shall not kill , and whoever kills shall be [ ac ] liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	5	22	But I say to you that everyone who continues to be [ ad ] angry with his brother or harbors malice ( enmity of heart ) against him shall be [ ae ] liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the court ; and whoever speaks contemptuously and insultingly to his brother shall be [ af ] liable to and unable to escape the punishment imposed by the Sanhedrin , and whoever says , You [ ag ] cursed fool ! [ You empty-headed idiot ! ] shall be [ ah ] liable to and unable to escape the hell ( Gehenna ) of fire .
AMPC	Matthew	5	23	So if when you are offering your gift at the altar you there remember that your brother has any [ grievance ] against you ,
AMPC	Matthew	5	24	Leave your gift at the altar and go . First make peace with your brother , and then come back and present your gift .
AMPC	Matthew	5	25	Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are on the way traveling with him , lest your accuser hand you over to the judge , and the judge to the guard , and you be put in prison .
AMPC	Matthew	5	26	Truly I say to you , you will not be released until you have paid the last fraction of a penny .
AMPC	Matthew	5	27	You have heard that it was said , You shall not commit adultery . ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	5	28	But I say to you that everyone who so much as looks at a woman with evil desire for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
AMPC	Matthew	5	29	If your right eye serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin , pluck it out and throw it away . It is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be cast into hell ( Gehenna ) .
AMPC	Matthew	5	30	And if your right hand serves as a trap to ensnare you or is an occasion for you to stumble and sin , cut it off and cast it from you . It is better that you lose one of your members than that your entire body should be cast into hell ( Gehenna ) .
AMPC	Matthew	5	31	It has also been said , Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce .
AMPC	Matthew	5	32	But I tell you , Whoever dismisses and repudiates and divorces his wife , except on the grounds of unfaithfulness ( sexual immorality ) , causes her to commit adultery , and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery . ( H )
AMPC	Matthew	5	33	Again , you have heard that it was said to the men of old , You shall not swear falsely , but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord [ as a religious duty ] .
AMPC	Matthew	5	34	But I tell you , Do not bind yourselves by an oath at all : either by heaven , for it is the throne of God ;
AMPC	Matthew	5	35	Or by the earth , for it is the footstool of His feet ; or by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the Great King . ( I )
AMPC	Matthew	5	36	And do not swear by your head , for you are not able to make a single hair white or black .
AMPC	Matthew	5	37	Let your Yes be simply Yes , and your No be simply No ; anything more than that comes from the evil one . ( J )
AMPC	Matthew	5	38	You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ( K )
AMPC	Matthew	5	39	But I say to you , Do not resist the evil man [ who injures you ] ; but if anyone strikes you on the right jaw or cheek , turn to him the other one too .
AMPC	Matthew	5	40	And if anyone wants to sue you and take your undershirt ( tunic ) , let him have your coat also .
AMPC	Matthew	5	41	And if anyone forces you to go one mile , go with him two [ miles ] .
AMPC	Matthew	5	42	Give to him who keeps on begging from you , and do not turn away from him who would borrow [ [ ai ] at interest ] from you . ( L )
AMPC	Matthew	5	43	You have heard that it was said , You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy ; ( M )
AMPC	Matthew	5	44	But I tell you , Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you , ( N )
AMPC	Matthew	5	45	[ aj ] To show that you are the children of your Father Who is in heaven ; for He makes His sun rise on the wicked and on the good , and makes the rain fall upon the upright and the wrongdoers [ alike ] .
AMPC	Matthew	5	46	For if you love those who love you , what reward can you have ? Do not even the tax collectors do that ?
AMPC	Matthew	5	47	And if you greet only your brethren , what more than others are you doing ? Do not even the Gentiles ( the heathen ) do that ?

AMPC	Matthew	6	6	But when you pray , go into your [ most ] private room , and , closing the door , pray to your Father , Who is in secret ; and your Father , Who sees in secret , will reward you in the open .
AMPC	Matthew	6	2	Thus , whenever you give to the poor , do not blow a trumpet before you , as the hypocrites in the synagogues and in the streets like to do , that they may be [ b ] recognized and honored and praised by men . Truly I tell you , they have their reward [ c ] in full already .
AMPC	Matthew	6	3	But when you give to charity , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing ,
AMPC	Matthew	6	4	So that your deeds of charity may be in secret ; and your Father Who sees in secret will reward you openly .
AMPC	Matthew	6	5	Also when you pray , you must not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by people . Truly I tell you , they have their reward [ d ] in full already .
AMPC	Matthew	6	7	And when you pray , do not heap up phrases ( multiply words , repeating the same ones over and over ) as the Gentiles do , for they think they will be heard for their much speaking . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	6	8	Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him .
AMPC	Matthew	6	9	Pray , therefore , like this : Our Father Who is in heaven , hallowed ( kept holy ) be Your name .
AMPC	Matthew	6	10	Your kingdom come , Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day our daily bread .
AMPC	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven ( [ e ] left , remitted , and let go of the debts , and have [ f ] given up resentment against ) our debtors .
AMPC	Matthew	6	13	And lead ( bring ) us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever . Amen .
AMPC	Matthew	6	14	For if you forgive people their trespasses [ their [ g ] reckless and willful sins , [ h ] leaving them , letting them go , and [ i ] giving up resentment ] , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
AMPC	Matthew	6	15	But if you do not forgive others their trespasses [ their [ j ] reckless and willful sins , [ k ] leaving them , letting them go , and [ l ] giving up resentment ] , neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses .
AMPC	Matthew	6	16	And whenever you are fasting , do not look gloomy and [ m ] sour and [ n ] dreary like the hypocrites , for they put on a dismal countenance , that their fasting may be apparent to and seen by men . Truly I say to you , they have their reward [ o ] in full already . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	6	17	But when you fast , perfume your head and wash your face ,
AMPC	Matthew	6	18	So that your fasting may not be noticed by men but by your Father , Who sees in secret ; and your Father , Who sees in secret , will reward you in the open .
AMPC	Matthew	6	19	Do not [ p ] gather and heap up and store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust and worm consume and destroy , and where thieves break through and steal .
AMPC	Matthew	6	20	But [ q ] gather and heap up and store for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust nor worm consume and destroy , and where thieves do not break through and steal ;
AMPC	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
AMPC	Matthew	6	22	The eye is the lamp of the body . So if your eye is sound , your entire body will be full of light .
AMPC	Matthew	6	23	But if your eye is unsound , your whole body will be full of darkness . If then the very light in you [ your [ r ] conscience ] is darkened , how dense is that darkness !
AMPC	Matthew	6	24	No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise and be [ s ] against the other . You can not serve God and mammon ( [ t ] deceitful riches , money , possessions , or [ u ] whatever is trusted in ) .
AMPC	Matthew	6	25	Therefore I tell you , stop being [ v ] perpetually uneasy ( anxious and worried ) about your life , what you shall eat or what you shall drink ; or about your body , what you shall put on . Is not life greater [ in quality ] than food , and the body [ far above and more excellent ] than clothing ?
AMPC	Matthew	6	26	Look at the birds of the air ; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father keeps feeding them . Are you not worth much more than they ?
AMPC	Matthew	6	27	And who of you by worrying and being anxious can add one unit of measure ( cubit ) to his stature or to the [ w ] span of his life ? ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	6	28	And why should you be anxious about clothes ? Consider the lilies of the field and [ x ] learn thoroughly how they grow ; they neither toil nor spin .
AMPC	Matthew	6	29	Yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his [ y ] magnificence ( excellence , dignity , and grace ) was not arrayed like one of these . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	6	30	But if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today is alive and green and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace , will He not much more surely clothe you , O you of little faith ?
AMPC	Matthew	6	31	Therefore do not worry and be anxious , saying , What are we going to have to eat ? or , What are we going to have to drink ? or , What are we going to have to wear ?
AMPC	Matthew	6	32	For the Gentiles ( heathen ) wish for and crave and diligently seek all these things , and your heavenly Father knows well that you need them all .
AMPC	Matthew	6	33	But seek ( [ z ] aim at and strive after ) first of all His kingdom and His righteousness ( [ aa ] His way of doing and being right ) , and then all these things [ ab ] taken together will be given you besides .
AMPC	Matthew	6	34	So do not worry or be anxious about tomorrow , for tomorrow will have worries and anxieties of its own . Sufficient for each day is its own trouble .

AMPC	Matthew	7	7	[ e ] Keep on asking and it will be given you ; [ f ] keep on seeking and you will find ; [ g ] keep on knocking [ reverently ] and [ the door ] will be opened to you .
AMPC	Matthew	7	2	For just as you judge and criticize and condemn others , you will be judged and criticized and condemned , and in accordance with the measure you [ use to ] deal out to others , it will be dealt out again to you .
AMPC	Matthew	7	3	Why do you [ a ] stare from without at the [ b ] very small particle that is in your brother ’ s eye but do not become aware of and consider the beam [ c ] of timber that is in your own eye ?
AMPC	Matthew	7	4	Or how can you say to your brother , Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye , when there is the beam [ d ] of timber in your own eye ?
AMPC	Matthew	7	5	You hypocrite , first get the beam of timber out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother ’ s eye .
AMPC	Matthew	7	6	Do not give that which is holy ( the sacred thing ) to the dogs , and do not throw your pearls before hogs , lest they trample upon them with their feet and turn and tear you in pieces .
AMPC	Matthew	7	8	For everyone who keeps on asking receives ; and he who keeps on seeking finds ; and to him who keeps on knocking , [ the door ] will be opened .
AMPC	Matthew	7	9	Or what man is there of you , if his son asks him for a loaf of bread , will hand him a stone ?
AMPC	Matthew	7	10	Or if he asks for a fish , will hand him a serpent ?
AMPC	Matthew	7	11	If you then , evil as you are , know how to give good and [ h ] advantageous gifts to your children , how much more will your Father Who is in heaven [ perfect as He is ] give good and [ i ] advantageous things to those who [ j ] keep on asking Him !
AMPC	Matthew	7	12	So then , whatever you desire that others would do to and for you , even so do also to and for them , for this is ( sums up ) the Law and the Prophets .
AMPC	Matthew	7	13	Enter through the narrow gate ; for wide is the gate and spacious and broad is the way that leads away to destruction , and many are those who are entering through it .
AMPC	Matthew	7	14	But the gate is narrow ( contracted [ k ] by pressure ) and the way is straitened and compressed that leads away to life , and few are those who find it . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	7	15	Beware of false prophets , who come to you dressed as sheep , but inside they are devouring wolves . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	7	16	You will [ l ] fully recognize them by their fruits . Do people pick grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles ?
AMPC	Matthew	7	17	Even so , every healthy ( sound ) tree bears good fruit [ [ m ] worthy of admiration ] , but the sickly ( decaying , worthless ) tree bears bad ( worthless ) fruit .
AMPC	Matthew	7	18	A good ( healthy ) tree can not bear bad ( worthless ) fruit , nor can a bad ( diseased ) tree bear [ n ] excellent fruit [ worthy of admiration ] .
AMPC	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
AMPC	Matthew	7	20	Therefore , you will [ o ] fully know them by their fruits .
AMPC	Matthew	7	21	Not everyone who says to Me , Lord , Lord , will enter the kingdom of heaven , but he who does the will of My Father Who is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to Me on that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in Your name and driven out demons in Your name and done many mighty works in Your name ?
AMPC	Matthew	7	23	And then I will say to them openly ( publicly ) , I never knew you ; depart from Me , you who act wickedly [ disregarding My commands ] . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	7	24	So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them [ obeying them ] will be like a [ p ] sensible ( prudent , practical , wise ) man who built his house upon the rock .
AMPC	Matthew	7	25	And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house ; yet it did not fall , because it had been founded on the rock .
AMPC	Matthew	7	26	And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them will be like a stupid ( foolish ) man who built his house upon the sand .
AMPC	Matthew	7	27	And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell—and great and complete was the fall of it .
AMPC	Matthew	7	28	When Jesus had finished these sayings [ the Sermon on the Mount ] , the crowds were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His teaching ,
AMPC	Matthew	7	29	For He was teaching as One Who had [ and was ] authority , and not as [ did ] the scribes .

AMPC	Matthew	8	8	But the centurion replied to Him , Lord , I am not worthy or fit to have You come under my roof ; but only speak the word , and my servant boy will be cured .
AMPC	Matthew	8	2	And behold , a leper came up to Him and , prostrating himself , worshiped Him , saying , Lord , if You are willing , You are able to [ a ] cleanse me by curing me .
AMPC	Matthew	8	3	And He reached out His hand and touched him , saying , I am willing ; be cleansed [ b ] by being cured . And instantly his leprosy was cured and cleansed .
AMPC	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus said to him , See that you tell nothing about this to anyone ; but go , show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded , for a testimony [ to your healing ] and as an evidence to the people . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	8	5	As Jesus went into Capernaum , a centurion came up to Him , begging Him ,
AMPC	Matthew	8	6	And saying , Lord , my servant boy is lying at the house paralyzed and [ c ] distressed with intense pains .
AMPC	Matthew	8	7	And Jesus said to him , I will come and restore him .
AMPC	Matthew	8	9	For I also am a man subject to authority , with soldiers subject to me . And I say to one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my slave , Do this , and he does it .
AMPC	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard him , He marveled and said to those who followed Him [ [ d ] who adhered steadfastly to Him , conforming to His example in living and , if need be , in dying also ] , I tell you truly , I have not found so much faith as this [ e ] with anyone , even in Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	8	11	I tell you , many will come from east and west , and will sit at table with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven ,
AMPC	Matthew	8	12	While the sons and heirs of the kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside , where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	8	13	Then to the centurion Jesus said , Go ; it shall be done for you as you have believed . And the servant boy was restored to health at that very [ f ] moment .
AMPC	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus went into Peter ’ s house , He saw his mother-in-law lying ill with a fever .
AMPC	Matthew	8	15	He touched her hand and the fever left her ; and she got up and began waiting on Him .
AMPC	Matthew	8	16	When evening came , they brought to Him many who were [ g ] under the power of demons , and He drove out the spirits with a word and restored to health all who were sick .
AMPC	Matthew	8	17	And thus He fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah , He Himself took [ [ h ] in order to carry away ] our weaknesses and infirmities and bore [ i ] away our diseases . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	8	18	Now Jesus , when He saw the great throngs around Him , gave orders to cross to the other side [ of the lake ] .
AMPC	Matthew	8	19	And a scribe came up and said to Him , Master , I will accompany You wherever You go .
AMPC	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus replied to him , Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have lodging places , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head .
AMPC	Matthew	8	21	Another of the disciples said to Him , Lord , let me first go and bury [ [ j ] care for till death ] my father .
AMPC	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said to him , Follow Me , and leave the dead [ [ k ] in sin ] to bury their own dead .
AMPC	Matthew	8	23	And after He got into the boat , His disciples followed Him .
AMPC	Matthew	8	24	And [ l ] suddenly , behold , there arose a violent storm on the sea , so that the boat was being covered up by the waves ; but He was sleeping .
AMPC	Matthew	8	25	And they went and awakened Him , saying , Lord , rescue and preserve us ! We are perishing !
AMPC	Matthew	8	26	And He said to them , Why are you timid and afraid , O you of little faith ? Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great and wonderful calm ( [ m ] a perfect peaceableness ) .
AMPC	Matthew	8	27	And the men were stunned with bewildered wonder and marveled , saying , What kind of Man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him !
AMPC	Matthew	8	28	And when He arrived at the other side in the country of the Gadarenes , two men under the control of demons went to meet Him , coming out of the tombs , so fierce and savage that no one was able to pass that way .
AMPC	Matthew	8	29	And behold , they shrieked and screamed , What have You to do with us , Jesus , Son of God ? Have You come to torment us before the appointed time ? ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	8	30	Now at some distance from there a drove of many hogs was grazing .
AMPC	Matthew	8	31	And the demons begged Him , If You drive us out , send us into the drove of hogs .
AMPC	Matthew	8	32	And He said to them , Begone ! So they came out and went into the hogs , and behold , the whole drove rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water .
AMPC	Matthew	8	33	The herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything , including what had happened to the men under the power of demons .
AMPC	Matthew	8	34	And behold , the whole town went out to meet Jesus ; and as soon as they saw Him , they begged Him to depart from their locality .

AMPC	Matthew	9	9	As Jesus passed on from there , He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector ’ s office ; and He said to him , [ g ] Be My disciple [ side with My party and follow Me ] . And he rose and followed Him .
AMPC	Matthew	9	2	And behold , they brought to Him a man paralyzed and prostrated by illness , lying on a sleeping pad ; and when Jesus saw their faith , He said to the paralyzed man , Take courage , son ; your sins are forgiven and the [ a ] penalty remitted .
AMPC	Matthew	9	3	And behold , some of the scribes said to themselves , This man blasphemes [ He claims the rights and prerogatives of God ] !
AMPC	Matthew	9	4	But Jesus , knowing ( [ b ] seeing ) their thoughts , said , Why do you think evil and harbor [ c ] malice in your hearts ?
AMPC	Matthew	9	5	For which is easier : to say , Your sins are forgiven and the [ d ] penalty remitted , or to say , Get up and walk ?
AMPC	Matthew	9	6	But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins and [ e ] remit the penalty , He then said to the paralyzed man , Get up ! Pick up your sleeping pad and go to your own house .
AMPC	Matthew	9	7	And he got up and went away to his own house .
AMPC	Matthew	9	8	When the crowds saw it , they were struck with fear and awe ; and they [ f ] recognized God and praised and thanked Him , Who had given such power and authority to men .
AMPC	Matthew	9	10	And as Jesus reclined at table in the house , behold , many tax collectors and [ h ] [ especially wicked ] sinners came and sat ( reclined ) with Him and His disciples .
AMPC	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw this , they said to His disciples , Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and those [ preeminently ] sinful ?
AMPC	Matthew	9	12	But when Jesus heard it , He replied , Those who are strong and well ( healthy ) have no need of a physician , but those who are weak and sick .
AMPC	Matthew	9	13	Go and learn what this means : I desire mercy [ that is , [ i ] readiness to help those in trouble ] and not sacrifice and sacrificial victims . For I came not to call and invite [ to repentance ] the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God ) , but sinners ( the erring ones and all those not free from sin ) . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	9	14	Then the disciples of John came to Jesus , inquiring , Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast [ j ] often , [ that is , abstain from food and drink as a religious exercise ] , but Your disciples do not fast ?
AMPC	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus replied to them , Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them ? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
AMPC	Matthew	9	16	And no one puts a piece of cloth that has not been shrunk on an old garment , for such a patch tears away from the garment and a worse rent ( tear ) is made .
AMPC	Matthew	9	17	Neither is new wine put in old wineskins ; for if it is , the skins burst and are [ k ] torn in pieces , and the wine is spilled and the skins are ruined . But new wine is put into fresh wineskins , and so both are preserved .
AMPC	Matthew	9	18	While He was talking this way to them , behold , a ruler entered and , kneeling down , worshiped Him , saying , My daughter has just [ l ] now died ; but come and lay Your hand on her , and she will come to life .
AMPC	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus got up and accompanied him , with His disciples .
AMPC	Matthew	9	20	And behold , a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment ; ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	9	21	For she kept saying to herself , If I only touch His garment , I shall be restored to health .
AMPC	Matthew	9	22	Jesus turned around and , seeing her , He said , Take courage , daughter ! Your faith has made you well . And at once the woman was restored to health .
AMPC	Matthew	9	23	And when Jesus came to the ruler ’ s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making an uproar and din ,
AMPC	Matthew	9	24	He said , Go away ; for the girl is not dead but sleeping . And they laughed and jeered at Him .
AMPC	Matthew	9	25	But when the crowd had been ordered to go outside , He went in and took her by the hand , and the girl arose .
AMPC	Matthew	9	26	And the news about this spread through all that district .
AMPC	Matthew	9	27	As Jesus passed on from there , two blind men followed Him , shouting loudly , Have pity and mercy on us , Son of David !
AMPC	Matthew	9	28	When He reached the house and went in , the blind men came to Him , and Jesus said to them , Do you believe that I am able to do this ? They said to Him , Yes , Lord .
AMPC	Matthew	9	29	Then He touched their eyes , saying , According to your faith and trust and reliance [ on the power invested in Me ] be it done to you ;
AMPC	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus earnestly and sternly charged them , See that you let no one know about this .
AMPC	Matthew	9	31	But they went off and blazed and spread His fame abroad throughout that whole district .
AMPC	Matthew	9	32	And while they were going away , behold , a dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus .
AMPC	Matthew	9	33	And when the demon was driven out , the dumb man spoke ; and the crowds were stunned with bewildered wonder , saying , Never before has anything like this been seen in Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , He drives out demons through and with the help of the prince of demons .
AMPC	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom and curing all kinds of disease and every weakness and infirmity .
AMPC	Matthew	9	36	When He saw the throngs , He was moved with pity and sympathy for them , because they were bewildered ( harassed and distressed and dejected and helpless ) , like sheep without a shepherd . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	9	37	Then He said to His disciples , The harvest is indeed plentiful , but the laborers are few .
AMPC	Matthew	9	38	So pray to the Lord of the harvest to [ m ] force out and thrust laborers into His harvest .

AMPC	Matthew	10	10	And do not take a provision bag or a [ a ] wallet for a collection bag for your journey , nor two undergarments , nor sandals , nor a staff ; for the workman deserves his support ( his living , his food ) .
AMPC	Matthew	10	2	Now these are the names of the twelve apostles ( special messengers ) : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
AMPC	Matthew	10	3	Philip and Bartholomew [ Nathaniel ] ; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector ; James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus [ Judas , not Iscariot ] ;
AMPC	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Cananaean , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed Him .
AMPC	Matthew	10	5	Jesus sent out these twelve , charging them , Go nowhere among the Gentiles and do not go into any town of the Samaritans ;
AMPC	Matthew	10	6	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	10	7	And as you go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand !
AMPC	Matthew	10	8	Cure the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , drive out demons . Freely ( without pay ) you have received , freely ( without charge ) give .
AMPC	Matthew	10	9	Take no gold nor silver nor [ even ] copper money in your purses ( belts ) ;
AMPC	Matthew	10	11	And into whatever town or village you go , inquire who in it is deserving , and stay there [ at his house ] until you leave [ that vicinity ] .
AMPC	Matthew	10	12	As you go into the house , give your greetings and wish it well .
AMPC	Matthew	10	13	Then if indeed that house is deserving , let come upon it your peace [ that is , [ b ] freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ] . But if it is not deserving , let your peace return to you .
AMPC	Matthew	10	14	And whoever will not receive and accept and welcome you nor listen to your message , as you leave that house or town , shake the dust [ of it ] from your feet .
AMPC	Matthew	10	15	Truly I tell you , it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town .
AMPC	Matthew	10	16	Behold , I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves ; be [ c ] wary and wise as serpents , and be innocent ( harmless , guileless , and [ d ] without falsity ) as doves . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	10	17	Be on guard against men [ whose [ e ] way or nature is to act in opposition to God ] ; for they will deliver you up to councils and flog you in their synagogues ,
AMPC	Matthew	10	18	And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake , as a witness to bear testimony before them and to the Gentiles ( the nations ) .
AMPC	Matthew	10	19	But when they deliver you up , do not be anxious about how or what you are to speak ; for what you are to say will be given you in that very hour and [ f ] moment ,
AMPC	Matthew	10	20	For it is not you who are speaking , but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you .
AMPC	Matthew	10	21	Brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child ; and children will take a stand against their parents and will have them put to death .
AMPC	Matthew	10	22	And you will be hated by all for My name ’ s sake , but he who perseveres and endures to the end will be saved [ [ g ] from spiritual disease and death in the world to come ] .
AMPC	Matthew	10	23	When they persecute you in one town [ that is , pursue you in a manner that would injure you and cause you to suffer because of your belief ] , flee to another town ; for truly I tell you , you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before [ h ] the Son of Man comes .
AMPC	Matthew	10	24	A disciple is not above his teacher , nor is a servant or slave above his master .
AMPC	Matthew	10	25	It is sufficient for the disciple to be like his teacher , and the servant or slave like his master . If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub [ [ i ] master of the dwelling ] , how much more will they speak evil of those of His household . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	10	26	So have no fear of them ; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed , or kept secret that will not become known .
AMPC	Matthew	10	27	What I say to you in the dark , tell in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim upon the housetops .
AMPC	Matthew	10	28	And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can not kill the soul ; but rather be afraid of Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell ( Gehenna ) .
AMPC	Matthew	10	29	Are not two [ j ] little sparrows sold for a penny ? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father ’ s leave ( consent ) and notice .
AMPC	Matthew	10	30	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
AMPC	Matthew	10	31	Fear not , then ; you are of more value than many sparrows .
AMPC	Matthew	10	32	Therefore , everyone who acknowledges Me before men and confesses Me [ [ k ] out of a state of oneness with Me ] , I will also acknowledge him before My Father Who is in heaven and [ l ] confess [ that I am abiding in ] him .
AMPC	Matthew	10	33	But whoever denies and disowns Me before men , I also will deny and disown him before My Father Who is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	10	34	Do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth ; I have not come to bring peace , but a sword .
AMPC	Matthew	10	35	For I have come to part asunder a man from his father , and a daughter from her mother , and a [ m ] newly married wife from her mother-in-law—
AMPC	Matthew	10	36	And a man ’ s foes will be they of his own household . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	10	37	He who loves [ and [ n ] takes more pleasure in ] father or mother more than [ in ] Me is not worthy of Me ; and he who loves [ and takes more pleasure in ] son or daughter more than [ in ] Me is not worthy of Me ;
AMPC	Matthew	10	38	And he who does not take up his cross and follow Me [ [ o ] cleave steadfastly to Me , conforming wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying also ] is not worthy of Me .
AMPC	Matthew	10	39	Whoever finds his [ [ p ] lower ] life will lose it [ the higher life ] , and whoever loses his [ lower ] life on My account will find it [ the higher life ] .
AMPC	Matthew	10	40	He who receives and welcomes and accepts you receives and welcomes and accepts Me , and he who receives and welcomes and accepts Me receives and welcomes and accepts Him Who sent Me .
AMPC	Matthew	10	41	He who receives and welcomes and accepts a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet ’ s reward , and he who receives and welcomes and accepts a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ’ s reward .
AMPC	Matthew	10	42	And whoever gives to one of these little ones [ in rank or influence ] even a cup of cold water because he is My disciple , surely I declare to you , he shall not lose his reward .

AMPC	Matthew	11	11	Truly I tell you , among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist ; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
AMPC	Matthew	11	2	Now when John in prison heard about the activities of Christ , he sent a message by his disciples
AMPC	Matthew	11	3	And asked Him , Are You the One Who was to come , or should we keep on expecting a different one ? ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	11	4	And Jesus replied to them , Go and report to John what you hear and see :
AMPC	Matthew	11	5	The blind receive their sight and the lame walk , lepers are cleansed ( by healing ) and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up and the poor have good news ( the Gospel ) preached to them . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	11	6	And blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ a ] to be envied ) is he who takes no offense at Me and finds no cause for stumbling in or through Me and is not hindered from seeing the Truth .
AMPC	Matthew	11	7	Then as these men went their way , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : What did you go out in the wilderness ( desert ) to see ? A reed swayed by the wind ?
AMPC	Matthew	11	8	What did you go out to see then ? A man clothed in soft garments ? Behold , those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings .
AMPC	Matthew	11	9	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one [ [ b ] out of the common , more eminent , more remarkable , and ] [ c ] superior to a prophet .
AMPC	Matthew	11	10	This is the one of whom it is written , Behold , I send My messenger ahead of You , who shall make ready Your way before You . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	11	12	And from the days of John the Baptist until the present time , the kingdom of heaven has endured violent assault , and violent men seize it by force [ as a precious prize—a [ d ] share in the heavenly kingdom is sought with most ardent zeal and intense exertion ] .
AMPC	Matthew	11	13	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied up until John .
AMPC	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to receive and accept it , John himself is Elijah who was to come [ before the kingdom ] . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	11	15	He who has ears to hear , let him be listening and let him consider and [ e ] perceive and comprehend by hearing .
AMPC	Matthew	11	16	But to what shall I liken this generation ? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces who call to their playmates ,
AMPC	Matthew	11	17	We piped to you [ playing wedding ] , and you did not dance ; we wailed dirges [ playing funeral ] , and you did not mourn and beat your breasts and weep aloud .
AMPC	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking [ with others ] , and they say , He has a demon !
AMPC	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking [ with others ] , and they say , Behold , a glutton and a wine drinker , a friend of tax collectors and [ [ f ] especially wicked ] sinners ! Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by what she does ( her deeds ) and by [ g ] her children .
AMPC	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to censure and reproach the cities in which most of His mighty works had been performed , because they did not repent [ and their hearts were not changed ] .
AMPC	Matthew	11	21	Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes [ and their hearts would have been changed ] .
AMPC	Matthew	11	22	I tell you [ further ] , it shall be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
AMPC	Matthew	11	23	And you , Capernaum , are you to be lifted up to heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades [ the region of the dead ] ! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have continued until today .
AMPC	Matthew	11	24	But I tell you , it shall be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you .
AMPC	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus began to say , I thank You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth [ and [ h ] I acknowledge openly and joyfully to Your honor ] , that You have hidden these things from the wise and clever and learned , and revealed them to babies [ to the [ i ] childish , untaught , and unskilled ] .
AMPC	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , [ I praise You that ] such was Your gracious will and good pleasure .
AMPC	Matthew	11	27	All things have been entrusted and delivered to Me by My Father ; and no one [ j ] fully knows and [ k ] accurately understands the Son except the Father , and no one [ l ] fully knows and [ m ] accurately understands the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son [ n ] deliberately wills to make Him known .
AMPC	Matthew	11	28	Come to Me , all you who labor and are heavy-laden and overburdened , and I will cause you to rest . [ I will [ o ] ease and relieve and [ p ] refresh [ q ] your souls . ]
AMPC	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me , for I am gentle ( meek ) and humble ( lowly ) in heart , and you will find rest ( [ r ] relief and ease and refreshment and [ s ] recreation and blessed quiet ) for your souls . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	11	30	For My yoke is wholesome ( useful , [ t ] good—not harsh , hard , sharp , or pressing , but comfortable , gracious , and pleasant ) , and My burden is light and easy to be borne .

AMPC	Matthew	12	12	How much better and of more value is a man than a sheep ! So it is lawful and allowable to do good on the Sabbath days .
AMPC	Matthew	12	2	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to Him , See there ! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful and not permitted on the Sabbath .
AMPC	Matthew	12	3	He said to them , Have you not even read what David did when he was hungry , and those who accompanied him— ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	12	4	How he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the showbread—which was not lawful for him to eat , nor for the men who accompanied him , but for the priests only ?
AMPC	Matthew	12	5	Or have you never read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath [ breaking it ] and yet are guiltless ? ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	12	6	But I tell you , Something greater and [ b ] more exalted and more majestic than the temple is here !
AMPC	Matthew	12	7	And if you had only known what this saying means , I desire mercy [ readiness to help , to spare , to forgive ] rather than sacrifice and sacrificial victims , you would not have condemned the guiltless . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord [ even ] of the Sabbath .
AMPC	Matthew	12	9	And going on from there , He went into their synagogue .
AMPC	Matthew	12	10	And behold , a man was there with one withered hand . And they said to Him , Is it lawful or allowable to cure people on the Sabbath days ? —that they might accuse Him .
AMPC	Matthew	12	11	But He said to them , What man is there among you , if he has only one sheep and it falls into a pit or ditch on the Sabbath , will not take hold of it and lift it out ?
AMPC	Matthew	12	13	Then He said to the man , Reach out your hand . And the man reached it out and it was restored , as sound as the other one .
AMPC	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and held a consultation against Him , how they might do away with Him .
AMPC	Matthew	12	15	But being aware of this , Jesus went away from there . And many people [ c ] joined and accompanied Him , and He cured all of them ,
AMPC	Matthew	12	16	And strictly charged them and sharply warned them not to make Him [ d ] publicly known .
AMPC	Matthew	12	17	This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah ,
AMPC	Matthew	12	18	Behold , My Servant Whom I have chosen , My Beloved in and with Whom My soul is well pleased and [ e ] has found its delight . I will put My Spirit upon Him , and He shall proclaim and [ f ] show forth justice to the nations .
AMPC	Matthew	12	19	He will not strive or wrangle or cry out loudly ; nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets ;
AMPC	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed He will not break , and a smoldering ( dimly burning ) wick He will not quench , till He brings [ g ] justice and a just cause to victory .
AMPC	Matthew	12	21	And in and on His name will the Gentiles ( the [ h ] peoples outside of Israel ) set their hopes . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	12	22	Then a blind and dumb man under the power of a demon was brought to Jesus , and He cured him , so that the blind and dumb man both spoke and saw .
AMPC	Matthew	12	23	And all the [ crowds of ] people were stunned with bewildered wonder and said , This can not be the Son of David , can it ?
AMPC	Matthew	12	24	But the Pharisees , hearing it , said , This [ i ] Man drives out demons only by and with the help of Beelzebub , the prince of demons .
AMPC	Matthew	12	25	And knowing their thoughts , He said to them , Any kingdom that is divided against itself is being brought to desolation and laid waste , and no city or house divided against itself will last or continue to stand .
AMPC	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan drives out Satan , he has become divided against himself and disunified ; how then will his kingdom last or continue to stand ?
AMPC	Matthew	12	27	And if I drive out the demons by [ help of ] Beelzebub , by whose [ help ] do your sons drive them out ? [ j ] For this reason they shall be your judges .
AMPC	Matthew	12	28	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out the demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you [ [ k ] before you expected it ] .
AMPC	Matthew	12	29	Or how can a person go into a strong man ’ s house and carry off his goods ( the entire equipment of his house ) without first binding the strong man ? Then indeed he may plunder his house .
AMPC	Matthew	12	30	He who is not with Me [ definitely [ l ] on My side ] is against Me , and he who does not [ definitely ] gather with Me and for [ m ] My side scatters .
AMPC	Matthew	12	31	Therefore I tell you , every sin and blasphemy ( every evil , abusive , [ n ] injurious speaking , or indignity against sacred things ) can be forgiven men , but blasphemy against the [ Holy ] Spirit shall not and [ o ] can not be forgiven .
AMPC	Matthew	12	32	And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but whoever speaks against the Spirit , the Holy One , will not be forgiven , either in this world and age or in the world and age to come .
AMPC	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree sound ( healthy and good ) , and its fruit sound ( healthy and good ) , or make the tree rotten ( diseased and bad ) , and its fruit rotten ( diseased and bad ) ; for the tree is known and recognized and judged by its fruit .
AMPC	Matthew	12	34	You offspring of vipers ! How can you speak good things when you are evil ( wicked ) ? For out of the fullness ( the overflow , the [ p ] superabundance ) of the heart the mouth speaks .
AMPC	Matthew	12	35	The good man from his inner good treasure [ q ] flings forth good things , and the evil man out of his inner evil storehouse [ r ] flings forth evil things .
AMPC	Matthew	12	36	But I tell you , on the day of judgment men will have to give account for every [ s ] idle ( inoperative , nonworking ) word they speak .
AMPC	Matthew	12	37	For by your words you will be justified and acquitted , and by your words you will be condemned and sentenced .
AMPC	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him , Teacher , we desire to see a sign or miracle from You [ proving that You are what You claim to be ] .
AMPC	Matthew	12	39	But He replied to them , An evil and adulterous generation ( a generation [ t ] morally unfaithful to God ) seeks and demands a sign ; but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah .
AMPC	Matthew	12	40	For even as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	12	41	The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , Someone more and greater than Jonah is here ! ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the South will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it ; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , Someone more and greater than Solomon is here . ( H )
AMPC	Matthew	12	43	But when the unclean spirit has gone out of a man , it roams through dry [ arid ] places in search of rest , but it does not find any .
AMPC	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , I will go back to my house from which I came out . And when it arrives , it finds the place unoccupied , swept , put in order , and decorated .
AMPC	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they go in and make their home there . And the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . So also shall it be with this wicked generation .
AMPC	Matthew	12	46	Jesus was still speaking to the people when behold , His mother and brothers stood outside , seeking to speak to Him .
AMPC	Matthew	12	47	. - Matthew 12:49 Hermann Cremer , Biblico-Theological Lexicon . Copyright ©
AMPC	Matthew	12	48	But He replied to the man who told Him , Who is My mother , and who are My brothers ?
AMPC	Matthew	12	49	And stretching out His hand toward [ not only the twelve disciples but all ] [ v ] His adherents , He said , Here are My mother and My brothers .
AMPC	Matthew	12	50	For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother !

AMPC	Matthew	13	13	This is the reason that I speak to them in parables : because [ d ] having the power of seeing , they do not see ; and [ e ] having the power of hearing , they do not hear , nor do they grasp and understand .
AMPC	Matthew	13	2	But such great crowds gathered about Him that He got into a boat and remained sitting there , while all the throng stood on the shore .
AMPC	Matthew	13	3	And He told them many things in parables ( stories by way of illustration and comparison ) , saying , A sower went out to sow .
AMPC	Matthew	13	4	And as he sowed , some seeds fell by the roadside , and the birds came and ate them up .
AMPC	Matthew	13	5	Other seeds fell on rocky ground , where they had not much soil ; and at once they sprang up , because they had no depth of soil .
AMPC	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun rose , they were scorched , and because they had no root , they dried up and withered away .
AMPC	Matthew	13	7	Other seeds fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them out .
AMPC	Matthew	13	8	Other seeds fell on good soil , and yielded grain—some a hundred times as much as was sown , some sixty times as much , and some thirty .
AMPC	Matthew	13	9	He who has ears [ to hear ] , let him be listening and let him [ a ] consider and [ b ] perceive and comprehend by hearing .
AMPC	Matthew	13	10	Then the disciples came to Him and said , Why do You speak to them in parables ?
AMPC	Matthew	13	11	And He replied to them , To you it has been given to know the secrets and mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been given .
AMPC	Matthew	13	12	For whoever has [ spiritual knowledge ] , to him will more be given and he will [ c ] be furnished richly so that he will have abundance ; but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
AMPC	Matthew	13	14	In them indeed is [ f ] the process of fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah , which says : You shall indeed hear and hear but never grasp and understand ; and you shall indeed look and look but never see and perceive .
AMPC	Matthew	13	15	For this nation ’ s heart has grown gross ( fat and dull ) , and their ears heavy and difficult of hearing , and their eyes they have tightly closed , lest they see and perceive with their eyes , and hear and comprehend the sense with their ears , and grasp and understand with their heart , and turn and I should heal them . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	13	16	But blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ g ] to be envied ) are your eyes because they do see , and your ears because they do hear .
AMPC	Matthew	13	17	Truly I tell you , many prophets and righteous men [ men who were upright and in right standing with God ] yearned to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it .
AMPC	Matthew	13	18	Listen then to the [ meaning of the ] parable of the sower :
AMPC	Matthew	13	19	[ h ] While anyone is hearing the Word of the kingdom and does not grasp and comprehend it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is what was sown along the roadside .
AMPC	Matthew	13	20	As for what was sown on thin ( rocky ) soil , this is he who hears the Word and at once welcomes and accepts it with joy ;
AMPC	Matthew	13	21	Yet it has no real root in him , but is temporary ( inconstant , [ i ] lasts but a little while ) ; and when affliction or trouble or persecution comes on account of the Word , at once he is caused to stumble [ he is repelled and [ j ] begins to distrust and desert Him Whom he ought to trust and obey ] and he falls away .
AMPC	Matthew	13	22	As for what was sown among thorns , this is he who hears the Word , but the cares of the world and the pleasure and delight and glamour and deceitfulness of riches choke and suffocate the Word , and it yields no fruit .
AMPC	Matthew	13	23	As for what was sown on good soil , this is he who hears the Word and grasps and comprehends it ; he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundred times as much as was sown , in another sixty times as much , and in another thirty .
AMPC	Matthew	13	24	Another parable He set forth before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
AMPC	Matthew	13	25	But while he was sleeping , his enemy came and sowed also darnel ( weeds resembling wheat ) among the wheat , and went on his way .
AMPC	Matthew	13	26	So when the plants sprouted and formed grain , the darnel ( weeds ) appeared also .
AMPC	Matthew	13	27	And the servants of the owner came to him and said , Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? Then how does it have darnel shoots in it ?
AMPC	Matthew	13	28	He replied to them , An enemy has done this . The servants said to him , Then do you want us to go and weed them out ?
AMPC	Matthew	13	29	But he said , No , lest in gathering the wild wheat ( weeds resembling wheat ) , you root up the [ true ] wheat along with it .
AMPC	Matthew	13	30	Let them grow together until the harvest ; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers , Gather the darnel first and bind it in bundles to be burned , but gather the wheat into my granary .
AMPC	Matthew	13	31	Another story by way of comparison He set forth before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field .
AMPC	Matthew	13	32	Of all the seeds it is the smallest , but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and find shelter in its branches .
AMPC	Matthew	13	33	He told them another parable : The kingdom of heaven is like leaven ( [ k ] sour dough ) which a woman took and covered over in three measures of meal or flour till all of it was leavened . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	13	34	These things [ l ] all taken together Jesus said to the crowds in parables ; indeed , without a parable He said nothing to them .
AMPC	Matthew	13	35	This was in fulfillment of what was spoken by the prophet : I will open My mouth in parables ; I will utter things that have been hidden since the foundation of the world . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	13	36	Then He left the throngs and went into the house . And His disciples came to Him saying , Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field .
AMPC	Matthew	13	37	He answered , He Who sows the good seed is the Son of Man .
AMPC	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , and the good seed means the children of the kingdom ; the darnel is the children of the evil one ,
AMPC	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy who sowed it is the devil . The harvest is the close and consummation of the age , and the reapers are angels .
AMPC	Matthew	13	40	Just as the darnel ( weeds resembling wheat ) is gathered and burned with fire , so it will be at the close of the age .
AMPC	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send forth His angels , and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of offense [ [ m ] persons by whom others are drawn into error or sin ] and all who do iniquity and act wickedly ,
AMPC	Matthew	13	42	And will cast them into the furnace of fire ; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth .
AMPC	Matthew	13	43	Then will the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God ) shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Let him who has ears [ to hear ] be listening , and let him [ n ] consider and perceive and understand by hearing . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	13	44	The kingdom of heaven is like [ o ] something precious buried in a field , which a man found and hid again ; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field .
AMPC	Matthew	13	45	Again the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a dealer in search of fine and [ p ] precious pearls ,
AMPC	Matthew	13	46	Who , on finding a single pearl of great price , went and sold all he had and bought it .
AMPC	Matthew	13	47	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a [ q ] dragnet which was cast into the sea and gathered in fish of every sort .
AMPC	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , men dragged it up on the beach , and sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets , but the worthless ones they threw away .
AMPC	Matthew	13	49	So it will be at the close and consummation of the age . The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God )
AMPC	Matthew	13	50	And cast them [ the wicked ] into the furnace of fire ; there will be weeping and wailing and grinding of teeth .
AMPC	Matthew	13	51	Have you understood [ r ] all these things [ parables ] taken together ? They said to Him , Yes , Lord .
AMPC	Matthew	13	52	He said to them , Therefore every [ s ] teacher and interpreter of the Sacred Writings who has been instructed about and trained for the kingdom of heaven and has [ t ] become a disciple is like a householder who brings forth out of his storehouse treasure that is new and [ treasure that is ] old [ the fresh as well as the familiar ] .
AMPC	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus had finished these parables ( these comparisons ) , He left there .
AMPC	Matthew	13	54	And coming to His own country [ Nazareth ] , He taught in their synagogue so that they were amazed with bewildered wonder , and said , Where did this [ u ] Man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers ?
AMPC	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter ’ s Son ? Is not His mother called Mary ? And are not His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas ?
AMPC	Matthew	13	56	And do not all His sisters live here among us ? Where then did this Man get all this ?
AMPC	Matthew	13	57	And they took offense at Him [ they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging His authority , and caused to stumble ] . But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house .
AMPC	Matthew	13	58	And He did not do many works of power there , because of their unbelief ( their lack of faith [ v ] in the divine mission of Jesus ) .

AMPC	Matthew	14	14	When He went ashore and saw a great throng of people , He had compassion ( pity and deep sympathy ) for them and cured their sick .
AMPC	Matthew	14	2	And he said to his attendants , This is John the Baptist ; He has been raised from the dead , and that is why the powers [ a ] of performing miracles are at work in Him .
AMPC	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison [ to [ b ] stow him out of the way ] on account and for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife ,
AMPC	Matthew	14	4	For John had said to him , It is not lawful or right for you to have her . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	14	5	Although he wished to have him put to death , he was afraid of the people , for they regarded John as a prophet .
AMPC	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst [ before the company ] and pleased and fascinated Herod ,
AMPC	Matthew	14	7	And so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask .
AMPC	Matthew	14	8	And she , being put forward and prompted by her mother , said , Give me the head of John the Baptist right here on a [ c ] platter .
AMPC	Matthew	14	9	And the king was distressed and sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests , he ordered it to be given her ;
AMPC	Matthew	14	10	He sent and had John beheaded in the prison .
AMPC	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought in on a [ d ] platter and given [ e ] to the little maid , and she brought it to her mother .
AMPC	Matthew	14	12	And John ’ s disciples came and took up the body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus .
AMPC	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard it , He withdrew from there privately in a boat to a solitary place . But when the crowds heard of it , they followed Him [ by land ] on foot from the towns .
AMPC	Matthew	14	15	When evening came , the disciples came to Him and said , This is a remote and barren place , and the day is now over ; send the throngs away into the villages to buy food for themselves .
AMPC	Matthew	14	16	Jesus said , They do not need to go away ; you give them something to eat .
AMPC	Matthew	14	17	They said to Him , We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish .
AMPC	Matthew	14	18	He said , Bring them here to Me .
AMPC	Matthew	14	19	Then He ordered the crowds to recline on the grass ; and He took the five loaves and the two fish , and , looking up to heaven , He gave thanks and blessed and broke the loaves and handed the pieces to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
AMPC	Matthew	14	20	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they picked up twelve [ [ f ] small hand ] baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
AMPC	Matthew	14	21	And those who ate were about 5,000 men , not including women and children .
AMPC	Matthew	14	22	Then He directed the disciples to get into the boat and go before Him to the other side , while He sent away the crowds .
AMPC	Matthew	14	23	And after He had dismissed the multitudes , He went up into the hills by Himself to pray . When it was evening , He was still there alone .
AMPC	Matthew	14	24	But the boat was by this time out on the sea , many furlongs [ a furlong is one-eighth of a mile ] distant from the land , beaten and tossed by the waves , for the wind was against them .
AMPC	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch [ between 3:00—6:00 a.m. ] of the night , Jesus came to them , walking on the sea .
AMPC	Matthew	14	26	And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea , they were terrified and said , It is a ghost ! And they screamed out with fright .
AMPC	Matthew	14	27	But instantly He spoke to them , saying , Take courage ! I Am ! Stop being afraid ! ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered Him , Lord , if it is You , command me to come to You on the water .
AMPC	Matthew	14	29	He said , Come ! So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water , and he came toward Jesus .
AMPC	Matthew	14	30	But when he perceived and felt the strong wind , he was frightened , and as he began to sink , he cried out , Lord , save me [ from death ] !
AMPC	Matthew	14	31	Instantly Jesus reached out His hand and caught and held him , saying to him , O you of little faith , why did you doubt ?
AMPC	Matthew	14	32	And when they got into the boat , the wind ceased .
AMPC	Matthew	14	33	And those in the boat knelt and worshiped Him , saying , Truly You are the Son of God !
AMPC	Matthew	14	34	And when they had crossed over to the other side , they went ashore at Gennesaret .
AMPC	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place recognized Him , they sent around into all the surrounding country and brought to Him all who were sick
AMPC	Matthew	14	36	And begged Him to let them merely touch the fringe of His garment ; and as many as touched it were perfectly restored .

AMPC	Matthew	15	15	But Peter said to Him , Explain this [ a ] proverb ( this [ b ] maxim ) to us .
AMPC	Matthew	15	2	Why do Your disciples transgress and violate the rules handed down by the elders of the past ? For they do not practice [ ceremonially ] washing their hands before they eat .
AMPC	Matthew	15	3	He replied to them , And why also do you transgress and violate the commandment of God for the sake of the rules handed down to you by your forefathers ( the elders ) ?
AMPC	Matthew	15	4	For God commanded , Honor your father and your mother , and , He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother , let him surely come to his end by death . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	15	5	But you say , If anyone tells his father or mother , What you would have gained from me [ that is , the money and whatever I have that might be used for helping you ] is already dedicated as a gift to God , then he is exempt and no longer under obligation to honor and help his father or his mother .
AMPC	Matthew	15	6	So for the sake of your tradition ( the rules handed down by your forefathers ) , you have set aside the Word of God [ depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect ] .
AMPC	Matthew	15	7	You pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! Admirably and truly did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said :
AMPC	Matthew	15	8	These people draw near Me with their mouths and honor Me with their lips , but their hearts hold off and are far away from Me .
AMPC	Matthew	15	9	Uselessly do they worship Me , for they teach as doctrines the commands of men . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	15	10	And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them , Listen and grasp and comprehend this :
AMPC	Matthew	15	11	It is not what goes into the mouth of a man that makes him unclean and defiled , but what comes out of the mouth ; this makes a man unclean and defiles [ him ] .
AMPC	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came and said to Him , Do You know that the Pharisees were displeased and offended and indignant when they heard this saying ?
AMPC	Matthew	15	13	He answered , Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be torn up by the roots . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone and disregard them ; they are blind guides and teachers . And if a blind man leads a blind man , both will fall into a ditch .
AMPC	Matthew	15	16	And He said , Are you also even yet dull and ignorant [ without understanding and [ c ] unable to put things together ] ?
AMPC	Matthew	15	17	Do you not see and understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the [ d ] abdomen and so passes on into the place where discharges are deposited ?
AMPC	Matthew	15	18	But whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart , and this is what makes a man unclean and defiles [ him ] .
AMPC	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart come evil thoughts ( reasonings and disputings and designs ) such as murder , adultery , sexual vice , theft , false witnessing , slander , and irreverent speech .
AMPC	Matthew	15	20	These are what make a man unclean and defile [ him ] ; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean or defile [ him ] .
AMPC	Matthew	15	21	And going away from there , Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon .
AMPC	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a woman who was a Canaanite from that district came out and , with a [ loud , troublesomely urgent ] cry , begged , Have mercy on me , O Lord , Son of David ! My daughter is miserably and distressingly and cruelly possessed by a demon !
AMPC	Matthew	15	23	But He did not answer her a word . And His disciples came and implored Him , saying , Send her away , for she is crying out after us .
AMPC	Matthew	15	24	He answered , I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	15	25	But she came and , kneeling , worshiped Him and kept praying , Lord , help me !
AMPC	Matthew	15	26	And He answered , It is not right ( proper , becoming , or fair ) to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the [ e ] little dogs .
AMPC	Matthew	15	27	She said , Yes , Lord , yet even the little pups ( [ f ] little whelps ) eat the crumbs that fall from their [ young ] masters ’ table .
AMPC	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered her , O woman , great is your faith ! Be it done for you as you wish . And her daughter was cured from that [ g ] moment .
AMPC	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus went on from there and passed along the shore of the Sea of Galilee . Then He went up into the hills and kept sitting there .
AMPC	Matthew	15	30	And a great multitude came to Him , bringing with them the lame , the maimed , the blind , the dumb , and many others , and they put them down at His feet ; and He cured them ,
AMPC	Matthew	15	31	So that the crowd was amazed when they saw the dumb speaking , the maimed made whole , the lame walking , and the blind seeing ; and they [ h ] recognized and praised and thanked and glorified the God of Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	15	32	Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said , I have pity and sympathy and am deeply moved for the crowd , because they have been with Me now three days and they have nothing [ at all left ] to eat ; and I am not willing to send them away hungry , lest they faint or become exhausted on the way .
AMPC	Matthew	15	33	And the disciples said to Him , Where are we to get bread sufficient to feed so great a crowd in this isolated and desert place ?
AMPC	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus asked them , How many loaves of bread do you have ? They replied , Seven , and a few small fish .
AMPC	Matthew	15	35	And ordering the crowd to recline on the ground ,
AMPC	Matthew	15	36	He took the seven loaves and the fish , and when He had given thanks , He broke them and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
AMPC	Matthew	15	37	And they all ate and were satisfied . And they gathered up seven [ [ i ] large provision ] baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over .
AMPC	Matthew	15	38	Those who ate were 4,000 men , not including the women and the children .
AMPC	Matthew	15	39	Then He dismissed the crowds , got into the boat , and went to the district of Magadan . Footnotes - Matthew 15:15 G.

AMPC	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and morally unfaithful generation craves a sign , but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah . Then He left them and went away . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	16	5	When the disciples reached the other side of the sea , they found that they had forgotten to bring any bread .
AMPC	Matthew	16	6	Jesus said to them , Be careful and on your guard against the leaven ( ferment ) of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
AMPC	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves about it , saying , It is because we did not bring any bread .
AMPC	Matthew	16	8	But Jesus , aware of this , asked , Why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread ? O you [ men , how little trust you have in Me , how ] little faith !
AMPC	Matthew	16	9	Do you not yet discern ( perceive and understand ) ? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many [ [ b ] small hand ] baskets you gathered ?
AMPC	Matthew	16	10	Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many [ [ c ] large provision ] baskets you took up ?
AMPC	Matthew	16	11	How is it that you fail to understand that I was not talking to you about bread ? But beware of the leaven ( ferment ) of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
AMPC	Matthew	16	12	Then they discerned that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
AMPC	Matthew	16	13	Now when Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi , He asked His disciples , Who do people say that the Son of Man is ?
AMPC	Matthew	16	14	And they answered , Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets .
AMPC	Matthew	16	15	He said to them , But who do you [ yourselves ] say that I am ?
AMPC	Matthew	16	17	Then Jesus answered him , Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ d ] to be envied ) are you , Simon Bar-Jonah . For flesh and blood [ men ] have not revealed this to you , but My Father Who is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	16	18	And I tell you , you are [ e ] Peter [ Greek , Petros—a large piece of rock ] , and on this rock [ Greek , petra—a [ f ] huge rock like Gibraltar ] I will build My church , and the gates of Hades ( the powers of the [ g ] infernal region ) shall [ h ] not overpower it [ or be strong to its detriment or hold out against it ] .
AMPC	Matthew	16	19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; and whatever you bind ( declare to be improper and unlawful ) on earth [ i ] must be what is already bound in heaven ; and whatever you loose ( declare lawful ) on earth [ j ] must be what is already loosed in heaven . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	16	20	Then He sternly and strictly charged and warned the disciples to tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ .
AMPC	Matthew	16	21	From that time forth Jesus began [ clearly ] to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and the high priests and scribes , and be killed , and on the third day be raised [ k ] from death .
AMPC	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter took Him aside [ l ] to speak to Him privately and began to reprove and [ m ] charge Him sharply , saying , God forbid , Lord ! This must never happen to You !
AMPC	Matthew	16	23	But Jesus turned [ n ] away from Peter and said to him , Get behind Me , Satan ! You are in My way [ an offense and a hindrance and a snare to Me ] ; for you are [ o ] minding what partakes not of the nature and quality of God , but of men .
AMPC	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to His disciples , If anyone desires to be My disciple , let him deny himself [ disregard , lose sight of , and forget himself and his own interests ] and take up his cross and follow Me [ [ p ] cleave steadfastly to Me , conform wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying , also ] .
AMPC	Matthew	16	25	For whoever is bent on saving his [ temporal ] life [ his comfort and security here ] shall lose it [ eternal life ] ; and whoever loses his life [ his comfort and security here ] for My sake shall find it [ life everlasting ] .
AMPC	Matthew	16	26	For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life [ his blessed [ q ] life in the kingdom of God ] ? Or what would a man give as an exchange for his [ blessed ] [ r ] life [ in the kingdom of God ] ?
AMPC	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory ( majesty , splendor ) of His Father with His angels , and then He will render account and reward every man in accordance with what he has done .
AMPC	Matthew	16	28	Truly I tell you , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in ( into ) His kingdom . Footnotes - Matthew 16:2 Some manuscripts do not have the rest of verse

AMPC	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answered , O you unbelieving ( [ f ] warped , wayward , rebellious ) and [ g ] thoroughly perverse generation ! How long am I to remain with you ? How long am I to bear with you ? Bring him here to Me .
AMPC	Matthew	17	2	And His appearance underwent a change in their presence ; and His face shone [ a ] clear and bright like the sun , and His clothing became as white as light .
AMPC	Matthew	17	3	And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , who kept talking with Him .
AMPC	Matthew	17	4	Then Peter began to speak and said to Jesus , Lord , it is good and delightful that we are here ; if You approve , I will put up three booths here—one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah .
AMPC	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , behold , a shining cloud [ [ b ] composed of light ] overshadowed them , and a voice from the cloud said , This is My Son , My Beloved , with Whom I am [ and [ c ] have always been ] delighted . Listen to Him ! ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	17	6	When the disciples heard it , they fell on their faces and were [ d ] seized with alarm and struck with fear .
AMPC	Matthew	17	7	But Jesus came and touched them and said , Get up , and do not be afraid .
AMPC	Matthew	17	8	And when they raised their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus only .
AMPC	Matthew	17	9	And as they were going down the mountain , Jesus cautioned and commanded them , Do not mention to anyone what you have seen , until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead .
AMPC	Matthew	17	10	The disciples asked Him , Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ?
AMPC	Matthew	17	11	He replied , Elijah does come and will get everything restored and ready .
AMPC	Matthew	17	12	But I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they did not know or recognize him , but did to him as they liked . So also the Son of Man is going to be treated and suffer at their hands .
AMPC	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them about John the Baptist . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	17	14	And when they approached the multitude , a man came up to Him , kneeling before Him and saying ,
AMPC	Matthew	17	15	Lord , do pity and have mercy on my son , for he has epilepsy ( is [ e ] moonstruck ) and he suffers terribly ; for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the water .
AMPC	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to Your disciples , and they were not able to cure him .
AMPC	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of him , and the boy was cured instantly .
AMPC	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked privately , Why could we not drive it out ?
AMPC	Matthew	17	20	He said to them , Because of the littleness of your faith [ that is , your lack of [ h ] firmly relying trust ] . For truly I say to you , if you have faith [ [ i ] that is living ] like a grain of mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , Move from here to yonder place , and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
AMPC	Matthew	17	21	[ j ] But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting .
AMPC	Matthew	17	22	When they were going about here and there in Galilee , Jesus said to them , The Son of Man is going to be turned over into the hands of men .
AMPC	Matthew	17	23	And they will kill Him , and He will be raised [ to life ] again on the third day . And they were deeply and exceedingly grieved and distressed .
AMPC	Matthew	17	24	When they arrived in Capernaum , the collectors of the half shekel [ the temple tax ] went up to Peter and said , Does not your Teacher pay the half shekel ? ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	17	25	He answered , Yes . And when he came home , Jesus spoke to him [ about it ] first , saying , What do you think , Simon ? From whom do earthly rulers collect duties or tribute—from their own sons or from others [ k ] not of their own family ?
AMPC	Matthew	17	26	And when Peter said , From other people [ l ] not of their own family , Jesus said to him , Then the sons are exempt .
AMPC	Matthew	17	27	However , in order not to give offense and cause them to stumble [ that is , to cause them [ m ] to judge unfavorably and unjustly ] go down to the sea and throw in a hook . Take the first fish that comes up , and when you open its mouth you will find there a shekel . Take it and give it to them to pay the temple tax for Me and for yourself .

AMPC	Matthew	18	18	Truly I tell you , whatever you forbid and declare to be improper and unlawful on earth must be [ e ] what is already forbidden in heaven , and whatever you permit and declare proper and lawful on earth must be [ f ] what is already permitted in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	18	2	And He called a little child to Himself and put him in the midst of them ,
AMPC	Matthew	18	3	And said , Truly I say to you , unless you repent ( change , turn about ) and become like little children [ trusting , lowly , loving , forgiving ] , you can never enter the kingdom of heaven [ at all ] .
AMPC	Matthew	18	4	Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [ trusting , lowly , loving , forgiving ] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	18	5	And whoever receives and accepts and welcomes one little child like this for My sake and in My name receives and accepts and welcomes Me .
AMPC	Matthew	18	6	But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in and [ a ] acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin [ that is , who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought ] , it would be better ( [ b ] more expedient and profitable or advantageous ) for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea .
AMPC	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world for such temptations to sin and influences to do wrong ! It is necessary that temptations come , but woe to the person on whose account or by whom the temptation comes !
AMPC	Matthew	18	8	And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble and sin , cut it off and throw it away from you ; it is better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for you to enter life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire .
AMPC	Matthew	18	9	And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin , pluck it out and throw it away from you ; it is better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for you to enter life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell ( Gehenna ) of fire .
AMPC	Matthew	18	10	Beware that you do not despise or feel scornful toward or think little of one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always are in the presence of and look upon the face of My Father Who is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	18	11	[ c ] For the Son of man came to save [ [ d ] from the penalty of eternal death ] that which was lost .
AMPC	Matthew	18	12	What do you think ? If a man has a hundred sheep , and one of them has gone astray and gets lost , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost ?
AMPC	Matthew	18	13	And if it should be that he finds it , truly I say to you , he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost .
AMPC	Matthew	18	14	Just so it is not the will of My Father Who is in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost and perish .
AMPC	Matthew	18	15	If your brother wrongs you , go and show him his fault , between you and him privately . If he listens to you , you have won back your brother .
AMPC	Matthew	18	16	But if he does not listen , take along with you one or two others , so that every word may be confirmed and upheld by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
AMPC	Matthew	18	17	If he pays no attention to them [ refusing to listen and obey ] , tell it to the church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , let him be to you as a pagan and a tax collector . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	18	19	Again I tell you , if two of you on earth agree ( harmonize together , make a symphony together ) about whatever [ anything and [ g ] everything ] they may ask , it will come to pass and be done for them by My Father in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	18	20	For wherever two or three are gathered ( drawn together as My followers ) in ( into ) My name , there I Am in the midst of them . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came up to Him and said , Lord , how many times may my brother sin against me and I forgive him and [ h ] let it go ? [ As many as ] up to seven times ?
AMPC	Matthew	18	22	Jesus answered him , I tell you , not up to seven times , but seventy times seven ! ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	18	23	Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a human king who wished to settle accounts with his attendants .
AMPC	Matthew	18	24	When he began the accounting , one was brought to him who owed him 10,000 talents [ probably about $ 10,000,000 ] ,
AMPC	Matthew	18	25	And because he could not pay , his master ordered him to be sold , with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed , and payment to be made .
AMPC	Matthew	18	26	So the attendant fell on his knees , begging him , Have patience with me and I will pay you everything .
AMPC	Matthew	18	27	And his master ’ s heart was moved with compassion , and he released him and forgave him [ cancelling ] the debt .
AMPC	Matthew	18	28	But that same attendant , as he went out , found one of his fellow attendants who owed him a hundred denarii [ about twenty dollars ] ; and he caught him by the throat and said , Pay what you owe !
AMPC	Matthew	18	29	So his fellow attendant fell down and begged him earnestly , Give me time , and I will pay you all !
AMPC	Matthew	18	30	But he was unwilling , and he went out and had him put in prison till he should pay the debt .
AMPC	Matthew	18	31	When his fellow attendants saw what had happened , they were greatly distressed , and they went and told everything that had taken place to their master .
AMPC	Matthew	18	32	Then his master called him and said to him , You contemptible and wicked attendant ! I forgave and cancelled all that [ great ] debt of yours because you begged me to .
AMPC	Matthew	18	33	And should you not have had pity and mercy on your fellow attendant , as I had pity and mercy on you ?
AMPC	Matthew	18	34	And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers ( the jailers ) , till he should pay all that he owed .
AMPC	Matthew	18	35	So also My heavenly Father will deal with every one of you if you do not freely forgive your brother from your heart his offenses .

AMPC	Matthew	19	19	Honor your father and your mother , and , You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	19	2	And great throngs accompanied Him , and He cured them there .
AMPC	Matthew	19	3	And Pharisees came to Him and put Him to the test by asking , Is it lawful and right to dismiss and repudiate and divorce one ’ s wife for any and [ a ] every cause ?
AMPC	Matthew	19	4	He replied , Have you never read that He Who made them from the beginning made them male and female ,
AMPC	Matthew	19	5	And said , For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united firmly ( joined inseparably ) to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh ? ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	19	6	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let not man put asunder ( separate ) .
AMPC	Matthew	19	7	They said to Him , Why then did Moses command [ us ] to give a certificate of divorce and thus to dismiss and repudiate a wife ? ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	19	8	He said to them , Because of the hardness ( stubbornness and perversity ) of your hearts Moses permitted you to dismiss and repudiate and divorce your wives ; but from the beginning it has not been [ b ] so [ ordained ] .
AMPC	Matthew	19	9	I say to you : whoever dismisses ( repudiates , divorces ) his wife , except for unchastity , and marries another commits adultery , [ c ] and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
AMPC	Matthew	19	10	The disciples said to Him , If the case of a man with his wife is like this , it is neither profitable nor advisable to marry .
AMPC	Matthew	19	11	But He said to them , Not all men can accept this saying , but it is for those to whom [ the capacity to receive ] it has been given .
AMPC	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs who have been born incapable of marriage ; and there are eunuchs who have been made so by men ; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves incapable of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Let him who is able to accept this accept it .
AMPC	Matthew	19	13	Then little children were brought to Jesus , that He might put His hands on them and pray ; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them .
AMPC	Matthew	19	14	But He said , Leave the children alone ! Allow the little ones to come to Me , and do not forbid or restrain or hinder them , for of such [ as these ] is the kingdom of heaven composed .
AMPC	Matthew	19	15	And He put His hands upon them , and then went on His way .
AMPC	Matthew	19	16	And behold , there came a man up to Him , saying , Teacher , what excellent and perfectly and essentially good deed must I do to possess eternal life ? ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	19	17	And He said to him , Why do you ask Me about the perfectly and essentially good ? There is only One Who is good [ perfectly and essentially ] —God . If you would enter into the Life , you must continually keep the commandments .
AMPC	Matthew	19	18	He said to Him , What [ d ] sort of commandments ? [ Or , which ones ? ] And Jesus answered , You shall not kill , You shall not commit adultery , You shall not steal , You shall not bear false witness , ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	19	20	The young man said , I have observed all these from my youth ; what still do I lack ?
AMPC	Matthew	19	21	Jesus answered him , If you would be perfect [ that is , [ e ] have that spiritual maturity which accompanies self-sacrificing character ] , go and sell what you have and give to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven ; and come , [ f ] be My disciple [ side with My party and follow Me ] .
AMPC	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this , he went away sad ( grieved and in much distress ) , for he had great possessions .
AMPC	Matthew	19	23	And Jesus said to His disciples , Truly I say to you , it will be difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	19	24	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the kingdom of heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were utterly puzzled ( astonished , bewildered ) , saying , Who then can be saved [ [ g ] from eternal death ] ?
AMPC	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus looked at them and said , With men this is impossible , but all things are possible with God . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter answered Him , saying , Behold , we have left [ our ] all and have become [ h ] Your disciples [ sided with Your party and followed You ] . What then shall we receive ?
AMPC	Matthew	19	28	Jesus said to them , Truly I say to you , in the new age [ the [ i ] Messianic rebirth of the world ] , when the Son of Man shall sit down on the throne of His glory , you who have [ become My disciples , sided with My party and ] followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel .
AMPC	Matthew	19	29	And anyone and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for My name ’ s sake will receive [ j ] many [ even a hundred ] times more and will inherit eternal life .
AMPC	Matthew	19	30	But many who [ now ] are first will be last [ then ] , and many who [ now ] are last will be first [ then ] .

AMPC	Matthew	20	20	Then the mother of Zebedee ’ s children came up to Him with her sons and , kneeling , worshiped Him and asked a favor of Him .
AMPC	Matthew	20	2	After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
AMPC	Matthew	20	3	And going out about the third hour ( nine o ’ clock ) , he saw others standing idle in the marketplace ;
AMPC	Matthew	20	4	And he said to them , You go also into the vineyard , and whatever is right I will pay you . And they went .
AMPC	Matthew	20	5	He went out again about the sixth hour ( noon ) , and the ninth hour ( three o ’ clock ) he did the same .
AMPC	Matthew	20	6	And about the eleventh hour ( five o ’ clock ) he went out and found still others standing around , and said to them , Why do you stand here idle all day ?
AMPC	Matthew	20	7	They answered him , Because nobody has hired us . He told them , You go out into the vineyard also [ b ] and you will get whatever is just and fair .
AMPC	Matthew	20	8	When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , Call the workmen and pay them their wages , beginning with the last and ending with the first . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	20	9	And those who had been hired at the eleventh hour ( five o ’ clock ) came and received a denarius each .
AMPC	Matthew	20	10	Now when the first came , they supposed they would get more , but each of them also received a denarius .
AMPC	Matthew	20	11	And when they received it , they grumbled at the owner of the estate ,
AMPC	Matthew	20	12	Saying , These [ men ] who came last worked no more than an hour , and yet you have made them rank with us who have borne the burden and the [ c ] scorching heat of the day .
AMPC	Matthew	20	13	But he answered one of them , Friend , I am doing you no injustice . Did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
AMPC	Matthew	20	14	Take what belongs to you and go . I choose to give to this man hired last the same as I give to you .
AMPC	Matthew	20	15	Am I not permitted to do what I choose with what is mine ? [ Or do you begrudge my being generous ? ] Is your eye evil because I am good ?
AMPC	Matthew	20	16	So those who [ now ] are last will be first [ then ] , and those who [ now ] are first will be last [ then ] . [ d ] For many are called , but few chosen .
AMPC	Matthew	20	17	And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , He took the twelve disciples aside along the way and said to them ,
AMPC	Matthew	20	18	Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes ; and they will sentence Him to death
AMPC	Matthew	20	19	And deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and whipped and crucified , and He will be raised [ to life ] on the third day .
AMPC	Matthew	20	21	And He asked her , What do you wish ? She answered Him , Give orders that these two sons of mine may sit , one at Your right hand and one at Your left in Your kingdom .
AMPC	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus replied , You do not realize what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink [ e ] and to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? They answered , We are able .
AMPC	Matthew	20	23	He said to them , You will drink My cup , but seats at My right hand and at My left are not Mine to give , but they are for those for whom they have been [ f ] ordained and prepared by My Father .
AMPC	Matthew	20	24	But when the ten [ other disciples ] heard this , they were indignant at the two brothers .
AMPC	Matthew	20	25	And Jesus called them to Him and said , You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great men hold them in subjection [ tyrannizing over them ] .
AMPC	Matthew	20	26	Not so shall it be among you ; but whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant ,
AMPC	Matthew	20	27	And whoever desires to be first among you must be your slave—
AMPC	Matthew	20	28	Just as the Son of Man came not to be waited on but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for many [ the price paid to set them free ] .
AMPC	Matthew	20	29	And as they were going out of Jericho , a great throng accompanied Him .
AMPC	Matthew	20	30	And behold , two blind men were sitting by the roadside , and when they heard that Jesus was passing by , they cried out , Lord , have pity and mercy on us , [ You ] Son of David !
AMPC	Matthew	20	31	The crowds reproved them and told them to keep still ; but they cried out all the more , Lord , have pity and mercy on us , [ You ] Son of David !
AMPC	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stopped and called them , and asked , What do you want Me to do for you ?
AMPC	Matthew	20	33	They answered Him , Lord , we want our eyes to be opened !
AMPC	Matthew	20	34	And Jesus , in pity , touched their eyes ; and instantly they received their sight and followed Him .

AMPC	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answered them , Truly I say to you , if you have faith ( a [ n ] firm relying trust ) and do not doubt , you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , Be taken up and cast into the sea , it will be done .
AMPC	Matthew	21	2	Saying to them , Go into the village that is opposite you , and at once you will find a donkey tied , and a colt with her ; untie [ them ] and bring [ them ] to Me .
AMPC	Matthew	21	3	If anyone says anything to you , you shall reply , The Lord needs them , and he will let them go without delay .
AMPC	Matthew	21	4	This happened that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled , saying ,
AMPC	Matthew	21	5	Say to the Daughter of Zion [ inhabitants of Jerusalem ] , Behold , your King is coming to you , lowly and riding on a donkey , and on a colt , the foal of a donkey [ a beast of burden ] . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	21	6	Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them .
AMPC	Matthew	21	7	They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their coats upon them , and He seated Himself on them [ the clothing ] .
AMPC	Matthew	21	8	And most of the crowd kept spreading their garments on the road , and others kept cutting branches from the trees and scattering them on the road .
AMPC	Matthew	21	9	And the crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed Him kept shouting , Hosanna ( [ a ] O be propitious , graciously inclined ) to the Son of David , [ [ b ] the Messiah ] ! Blessed ( praised , glorified ) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord ! Hosanna ( O be favorably disposed ) in the highest [ heaven ] ! ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	21	10	And when He entered Jerusalem , all the city became agitated and [ c ] [ trembling with excitement ] said , Who is [ d ] This ?
AMPC	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds replied , This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee .
AMPC	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus went into the temple ( [ e ] whole temple enclosure ) and drove out all who bought and sold in the [ f ] sacred place , and He turned over the [ g ] four-footed tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who sold doves .
AMPC	Matthew	21	13	He said to them , The Scripture says , My house shall be called a house of prayer ; but you have made it a den of robbers . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in the [ h ] porches and courts of the temple , and He cured them .
AMPC	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He did and the boys and the girls and the [ i ] youths and the maidens crying out in the [ j ] porches and courts of the temple , Hosanna ( O be propitious , graciously inclined ) to the Son of David ! they were indignant .
AMPC	Matthew	21	16	And they said to Him , Do You hear what these are saying ? And Jesus replied to them , Yes ; have you never read , Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have made ( provided ) perfect praise ? ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	21	17	And leaving them , He departed from the city and went out to Bethany and lodged there .
AMPC	Matthew	21	18	In the early dawn the next morning , as He was coming back to the city , He was hungry .
AMPC	Matthew	21	19	And as He saw [ k ] one single leafy fig tree [ l ] above the roadside , He went to it but He found nothing but leaves on it [ [ m ] seeing that in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves ] . And He said to it , Never again shall fruit grow on you ! And the fig tree withered up at once .
AMPC	Matthew	21	20	When the disciples saw it , they marveled greatly and asked , How is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once ?
AMPC	Matthew	21	22	And whatever you ask for in prayer , having faith and [ really ] believing , you will receive .
AMPC	Matthew	21	23	And when He entered the sacred [ o ] enclosure of the temple , the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him as He was teaching and said , By what [ p ] power of authority are You doing these things , and who gave You this power of authority ?
AMPC	Matthew	21	24	Jesus answered them , I also will ask you a question , and if you give Me the answer , then I also will tell you by what [ q ] power of authority I do these things .
AMPC	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John—from where was it ? From heaven or from men ? And they reasoned and argued with one another , If we say , From heaven , [ r ] He will ask us , Why then did you not believe him ?
AMPC	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , From men—we are afraid of and must reckon with the multitude , for they all regard John as a prophet .
AMPC	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Jesus , We do not know . And He said to them , Neither will I tell you by what [ s ] power of authority I do these things .
AMPC	Matthew	21	28	What do you think ? There was a man who had two sons . He came to the first and said , Son , go and work today in the vineyard .
AMPC	Matthew	21	29	And he answered , I will not ; but afterward he changed his mind and went .
AMPC	Matthew	21	30	Then the man came to the second and said the same [ thing ] . And he replied , I will [ go ] , sir ; but he did not go .
AMPC	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of the father ? They replied , The first one . Jesus said to them , Truly I tell you , the tax collectors and the harlots will get into the kingdom of heaven before you .
AMPC	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you walking in the way of an upright man in right standing with God , and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the harlots did believe him ; and you , even when you saw that , did not afterward change your minds and believe him [ adhere to , trust in , and rely on what he told you ] .
AMPC	Matthew	21	33	Listen to another parable : There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a wine vat in it and built a watchtower . Then he let it out [ for rent ] to tenants and went into another country .
AMPC	Matthew	21	34	When the fruit season drew near , he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [ share of the ] fruit .
AMPC	Matthew	21	35	But the tenants took his servants and beat one , killed another , and stoned another .
AMPC	Matthew	21	36	Again he sent other servants , more than the first time , and they treated them the same way .
AMPC	Matthew	21	37	Finally he sent his own son to them , saying , They will respect and give heed to my son .
AMPC	Matthew	21	38	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , This is the heir ; come on , let us kill him and have his inheritance .
AMPC	Matthew	21	39	And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him .
AMPC	Matthew	21	40	Now when the owner of the vineyard comes back , what will he do to those tenants ?
AMPC	Matthew	21	41	They said to Him , He will put those wretches to a miserable death and rent the vineyard to other tenants [ t ] of such a character that they will give him the fruits promptly in their season . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	21	42	Jesus asked them , Have you never read in the Scriptures : The very Stone which the builders rejected and threw away has become the Cornerstone ; this is the Lord ’ s doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ? ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	21	43	I tell you , for this reason the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce the fruits of it .

AMPC	Matthew	22	22	When they heard it they were amazed and marveled ; and they left Him and departed .
AMPC	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son
AMPC	Matthew	22	3	And sent his servants to summon those who had been invited to the wedding banquet , but they refused to come .
AMPC	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent other servants , saying , Tell those who are invited , Behold , I have prepared my banquet ; my bullocks and my fat calves are killed , and everything is prepared ; come to the wedding feast .
AMPC	Matthew	22	5	But they were not concerned and paid no attention [ they ignored and made light of the summons , treating it with contempt ] and they went away—one to his farm , another to his business ,
AMPC	Matthew	22	6	While the others seized his servants , treated them shamefully , and put them to death .
AMPC	Matthew	22	7	[ Hearing this ] the king was infuriated ; and he sent his soldiers and put those murderers to death and burned their city .
AMPC	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his servants , The wedding [ feast ] is prepared , but those invited were not worthy .
AMPC	Matthew	22	9	So go to the thoroughfares where they leave the city [ where the main roads and those from the country end ] and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find .
AMPC	Matthew	22	10	And those servants went out on the crossroads and got together as many as they found , both bad and good , so [ the room in which ] the wedding feast [ was held ] was filled with guests .
AMPC	Matthew	22	11	But when the king came in to view the guests , he looked intently at a man there who had on no wedding garment .
AMPC	Matthew	22	12	And he said , Friend , how did you come in here without putting on the [ appropriate ] wedding garment ? And he was speechless ( [ a ] muzzled , gagged ) .
AMPC	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the attendants , Tie him hand and foot , and throw him into the darkness outside ; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .
AMPC	Matthew	22	14	For many are called ( invited and summoned ) , but few are chosen .
AMPC	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees went and consulted and plotted together how they might entangle Jesus in His talk .
AMPC	Matthew	22	16	And they sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians , saying , Teacher , we know that You are [ b ] sincere and what You profess to be and that You teach the way of God truthfully , regardless of consequences and being afraid of no man ; for You are impartial and do not regard either the person or the position of anyone .
AMPC	Matthew	22	17	Tell us then what You think about this : Is it lawful to pay tribute [ levied on individuals and to be paid yearly ] to Caesar or not ?
AMPC	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus , aware of their malicious plot , asked , Why do you put Me to the test and try to entrap Me , you pretenders ( hypocrites ) ?
AMPC	Matthew	22	19	Show me the money used for the tribute . And they brought Him a denarius .
AMPC	Matthew	22	20	And Jesus said to them , Whose likeness and title are these ?
AMPC	Matthew	22	21	They said , Caesar ’ s . Then He said to them , Pay therefore to Caesar the things that are due to Caesar , and pay to God the things that are due to God .
AMPC	Matthew	22	23	The same day some Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection [ of the dead ] , came to Him and they asked Him a question ,
AMPC	Matthew	22	24	Saying , Teacher , Moses said , If a man dies , leaving no children , his brother shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us ; the first married and died , and , having no children , left his wife to his brother .
AMPC	Matthew	22	26	The second also died childless , and the third , down to the seventh .
AMPC	Matthew	22	27	Last of all , the woman died also .
AMPC	Matthew	22	28	Now , in the resurrection , to which of the seven will she be wife ? For they all had her .
AMPC	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus replied to them , You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor God ’ s power .
AMPC	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrected state neither do [ men ] marry nor are [ women ] given in marriage , but they are like the angels in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	22	31	But as to the resurrection of the dead—have you never read what was said to you by God ,
AMPC	Matthew	22	32	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living ! ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	22	33	And when the throng heard it , they were astonished and filled with [ [ c ] glad ] amazement at His teaching .
AMPC	Matthew	22	34	Now when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced ( [ d ] muzzled ) the Sadducees , they gathered together .
AMPC	Matthew	22	35	And one of their number , a lawyer , asked Him a question to test Him .
AMPC	Matthew	22	36	Teacher , which [ e ] kind of commandment is great and important ( the principal kind ) in the Law ? [ Some commandments are light—which are heavy ? ]
AMPC	Matthew	22	37	And He replied to him , You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind ( intellect ) . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	22	38	This is the great ( most important , principal ) and first commandment .
AMPC	Matthew	22	39	And a second is like it : You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	22	40	These two commandments [ f ] sum up and upon them depend all the Law and the Prophets .
AMPC	Matthew	22	41	Now while the Pharisees were still assembled there , Jesus asked them a question ,
AMPC	Matthew	22	42	Saying , What do you think of the Christ ? Whose Son is He ? They said to Him , The Son of David .
AMPC	Matthew	22	43	He said to them , How is it then that David , under the influence of the [ Holy ] Spirit , calls Him Lord , saying ,
AMPC	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said to My Lord , Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet ? ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	22	45	If then David thus calls Him Lord , how is He his Son ?
AMPC	Matthew	22	46	And no one was able to answer Him a word , nor from that day did anyone venture or dare to question Him .

AMPC	Matthew	23	23	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you give a tenth of your mint and dill and cummin , and have neglected and omitted the weightier ( more important ) matters of the Law—right and justice and mercy and fidelity . These you ought [ particularly ] to have done , without neglecting the others .
AMPC	Matthew	23	2	The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses ’ seat [ of authority ] .
AMPC	Matthew	23	3	So observe and practice all they tell you ; but do not do what they do , for they preach , but do not practice .
AMPC	Matthew	23	4	They tie up heavy loads , hard to bear , and place them on men ’ s shoulders , but they themselves will not lift a finger to help bear them .
AMPC	Matthew	23	5	They do all their works to be seen of men ; for they make wide their phylacteries ( [ a ] small cases enclosing certain Scripture passages , worn during prayer on the left arm and forehead ) and make long their fringes [ worn by all male Israelites , according to the command ] . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	23	6	And they [ b ] take pleasure in and [ thus ] love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues ,
AMPC	Matthew	23	7	And to be greeted with honor in the marketplaces and to have people call them rabbi .
AMPC	Matthew	23	8	But you are not to be called rabbi ( teacher ) , for you have one Teacher and you are all brothers .
AMPC	Matthew	23	9	And do not call anyone [ in the church ] on earth father , for you have one Father , Who is in heaven .
AMPC	Matthew	23	10	And you must not be called masters ( leaders ) , for you have one Master ( Leader ) , the Christ .
AMPC	Matthew	23	11	He who is greatest among you shall be your servant .
AMPC	Matthew	23	12	Whoever exalts himself [ [ c ] with haughtiness and empty pride ] shall be humbled ( brought low ) , and whoever humbles himself [ whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly ] shall be [ d ] raised to honor .
AMPC	Matthew	23	13	But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in men ’ s faces ; for you neither enter yourselves , nor do you allow those who are about to go in to do so .

AMPC	Matthew	23	15	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you travel over sea and land to make a single proselyte , and when he becomes one [ a proselyte ] , you make him doubly as much a child of hell ( Gehenna ) as you are .
AMPC	Matthew	23	16	Woe to you , blind guides , who say , If anyone swears by the [ f ] sanctuary of the temple , it is nothing ; but if anyone swears by the gold of the [ g ] sanctuary , he is a debtor [ bound by his oath ] .
AMPC	Matthew	23	17	You blind fools ! For which is greater : the gold , or the [ h ] sanctuary of the temple that has made the gold sacred ? ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	23	18	You say too , Whoever swears by the altar is not duty bound ; but whoever swears by the offering on the altar , his oath is binding .
AMPC	Matthew	23	19	You blind men ! Which is greater : the gift , or the altar which makes the gift sacred ?
AMPC	Matthew	23	20	So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it .
AMPC	Matthew	23	21	And he who swears by the [ i ] sanctuary of the temple swears by it and by Him Who dwells in it . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	23	22	And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him Who sits upon it .
AMPC	Matthew	23	24	You blind guides , filtering out a gnat and gulping down a [ j ] camel ! ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	23	25	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate , but within they are full of extortion ( prey , spoil , plunder ) and grasping self-indulgence .
AMPC	Matthew	23	26	You blind Pharisee ! First clean the inside of the cup and of the plate , so that the outside may be clean also .
AMPC	Matthew	23	27	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you are like tombs that have been whitewashed , which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead men ’ s bones and everything impure .
AMPC	Matthew	23	28	Just so , you also outwardly seem to people to be just and upright but inside you are full of pretense and lawlessness and iniquity . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	23	29	Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , pretenders ( hypocrites ) ! For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous ,
AMPC	Matthew	23	30	Saying , If we had lived in the days of our forefathers , we would not have aided them in shedding the blood of the prophets .
AMPC	Matthew	23	31	Thus you are testifying against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets .
AMPC	Matthew	23	32	Fill up , then , the measure of your fathers ’ sins to the brim [ so [ k ] that nothing may be wanting to a full measure ] .
AMPC	Matthew	23	33	You serpents ! You spawn of vipers ! How can you escape the [ l ] penalty to be suffered in hell ( Gehenna ) ?
AMPC	Matthew	23	34	Because of this , take notice : I am sending you prophets and wise men ( interpreters and teachers ) and scribes ( men learned in the Mosaic Law and the Prophets ) ; some of them you will kill , even crucify , and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue and persecute from town to town ,
AMPC	Matthew	23	35	So that upon your heads may come all the blood of the righteous ( [ m ] those who correspond to the divine standard of right ) shed on earth , from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah , whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar [ of burnt offering ] . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	23	36	Truly I declare to you , all these [ [ n ] evil , calamitous times ] will come upon this generation . ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	23	37	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , murdering the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you ! How often would I have gathered your children together as a mother fowl gathers her brood under her wings , and you refused !
AMPC	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house is forsaken and desolate ( abandoned and left destitute of God ’ s help ) . ( H )
AMPC	Matthew	23	39	For I declare to you , you will not see Me again until you say , Blessed ( magnified in worship , adored , and exalted ) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord !

AMPC	Matthew	24	24	For false Christs and false prophets will arise , and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive and lead astray , if possible , even the elect ( God ’ s chosen ones ) .
AMPC	Matthew	24	2	But He answered them , Do you see all these ? Truly I tell you , there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down .
AMPC	Matthew	24	3	While He was seated on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came to Him privately and said , Tell us , when will this take place , and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end ( the completion , the consummation ) of the age ?
AMPC	Matthew	24	4	Jesus answered them , Be careful that no one misleads you [ deceiving you and leading you into error ] .
AMPC	Matthew	24	5	For many will come in ( on the strength of ) My name [ [ b ] appropriating the name which belongs to Me ] , saying , I am the Christ ( the Messiah ) , and they will lead many astray .
AMPC	Matthew	24	6	And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars ; see that you are not frightened or troubled , for this must take place , but the end is not yet .
AMPC	Matthew	24	7	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes in place after place ;
AMPC	Matthew	24	8	All this is but the beginning [ the early pains ] of the [ c ] birth pangs [ of the [ d ] intolerable anguish ] .
AMPC	Matthew	24	9	Then they will hand you over to suffer affliction and tribulation and put you to death , and you will be hated by all nations for My name ’ s sake .
AMPC	Matthew	24	10	And then many will be offended and repelled and will [ e ] begin to distrust and desert [ Him Whom they ought to trust and obey ] and will stumble and fall away and betray one another and pursue one another with hatred .
AMPC	Matthew	24	11	And many false prophets will rise up and deceive and lead many into error .
AMPC	Matthew	24	12	And the love of [ f ] the great body of people will grow cold because of the multiplied lawlessness and iniquity ,
AMPC	Matthew	24	13	But he who endures to the end will be saved .
AMPC	Matthew	24	14	And this good news of the kingdom ( the Gospel ) will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations , and then will come the end .
AMPC	Matthew	24	15	So when you see the appalling sacrilege [ the abomination that astonishes and makes desolate ] , spoken of by the prophet Daniel , standing in the Holy Place—let the reader take notice and [ g ] ponder and consider and heed [ this ] — ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	24	16	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains ;
AMPC	Matthew	24	17	Let him who is on the housetop not come down and go into the house to take anything ;
AMPC	Matthew	24	18	And let him who is in the field not turn back to get his overcoat .
AMPC	Matthew	24	19	And alas for the women who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days !
AMPC	Matthew	24	20	Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath .
AMPC	Matthew	24	21	For then there will be great tribulation ( affliction , distress , and oppression ) such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now—no , and never will be [ again ] . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	24	22	And if those days had not been shortened , no human being would endure and survive , but for the sake of the elect ( God ’ s chosen ones ) those days will be shortened .
AMPC	Matthew	24	23	If anyone says to you then , Behold , here is the Christ ( the Messiah ) ! or , There He is ! —do not believe it .
AMPC	Matthew	24	25	See , I have warned you beforehand .
AMPC	Matthew	24	26	So if they say to you , Behold , He is in the wilderness ( desert ) —do not go out there ; if they tell you , Behold , He is in the secret places or inner rooms—do not believe it .
AMPC	Matthew	24	27	For just as the lightning flashes from the east and shines and [ h ] is seen as far as the west , so will the coming of the Son of Man be .
AMPC	Matthew	24	28	Wherever there is a fallen body ( a corpse ) , there the vultures ( or eagles ) will flock together . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	24	29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not shed its light , and the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	24	30	Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky , and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and [ i ] beat their breasts and lament in anguish , and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory [ in brilliancy and splendor ] . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	24	31	And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call , and they will gather His elect ( His chosen ones ) from the four winds , [ even ] from one end of the [ j ] universe to the other . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	24	32	From the fig tree learn this lesson : as soon as its [ k ] young shoots become soft and tender and it puts out its leaves , you know [ l ] of a surety that summer is near .
AMPC	Matthew	24	33	So also when you see these signs , [ m ] all taken together , coming to pass , you may know [ n ] of a surety that He is near , at the very doors .
AMPC	Matthew	24	34	Truly I tell you , this generation ( [ o ] the whole multitude of people living at the same time , [ p ] in a definite , [ q ] given period ) will not pass away till all these things [ r ] taken together take place .
AMPC	Matthew	24	35	[ s ] Sky and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
AMPC	Matthew	24	36	But of that [ exact ] day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
AMPC	Matthew	24	37	As were the days of Noah , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
AMPC	Matthew	24	38	For just as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking , [ men ] marrying and [ women ] being given in marriage , until the [ very ] day when Noah went into the ark ,
AMPC	Matthew	24	39	And they did not know or understand until the flood came and swept them all away—so will be the coming of the Son of Man . ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	24	40	At that time two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and one will be left .
AMPC	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be grinding at the hand mill ; one will be taken and one will be left .
AMPC	Matthew	24	42	Watch therefore [ [ t ] give strict attention , be cautious and active ] , for you do not know in what kind of a day [ [ u ] whether a near or remote one ] your Lord is coming .
AMPC	Matthew	24	43	But understand this : had the householder known in what [ part of the night , whether in a [ v ] night or a morning ] watch the thief was coming , he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be [ w ] undermined and broken into .
AMPC	Matthew	24	44	You also must be ready therefore , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect Him .
AMPC	Matthew	24	45	Who then is the faithful , thoughtful , and wise servant , whom his master has put in charge of his household to give to the others the food and supplies at the proper time ?
AMPC	Matthew	24	46	Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ x ] to be envied ) is that servant whom , when his master comes , he will find so doing .
AMPC	Matthew	24	47	I solemnly declare to you , he will set him over all his possessions .
AMPC	Matthew	24	48	But if that servant is wicked and says to himself , My master is delayed and is going to be gone a long time ,
AMPC	Matthew	24	49	And begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken ,
AMPC	Matthew	24	50	The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he is not aware ,
AMPC	Matthew	24	51	And will punish him [ [ y ] cut him up by scourging ] and put him with the pretenders ( hypocrites ) ; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .

AMPC	Matthew	25	25	So I was afraid , and I went and hid your talent in the ground . Here you have what is your own .
AMPC	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish ( thoughtless , without forethought ) and five were wise ( sensible , intelligent , and prudent ) .
AMPC	Matthew	25	3	For when the foolish took their lamps , they did not take any [ extra ] oil with them ;
AMPC	Matthew	25	4	But the wise took flasks of oil along with them [ also ] with their lamps .
AMPC	Matthew	25	5	While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming , they all began nodding their heads , and they fell asleep .
AMPC	Matthew	25	6	But at midnight there was a shout , Behold , the bridegroom ! Go out to meet him !
AMPC	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order .
AMPC	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said to the wise , Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out .
AMPC	Matthew	25	9	But the wise replied , There will not be enough for us and for you ; go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves .
AMPC	Matthew	25	10	But while they were going away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage feast ; and the door was shut .
AMPC	Matthew	25	11	Later the other virgins also came and said , Lord , Lord , open [ the door ] to us !
AMPC	Matthew	25	12	But He replied , I solemnly declare to you , I do not know you [ I am not acquainted with you ] .
AMPC	Matthew	25	13	Watch therefore [ give strict attention and be cautious and active ] , for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come .
AMPC	Matthew	25	14	For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey , and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property .
AMPC	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five talents [ probably about $ 5,000 ] , to another two , to another one—to each in proportion to his own [ a ] personal ability . Then he departed and left the country .
AMPC	Matthew	25	16	He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them , and he gained five talents more .
AMPC	Matthew	25	17	And likewise he who had received the two talents—he also gained two talents more .
AMPC	Matthew	25	18	But he who had received the one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master ’ s money .
AMPC	Matthew	25	19	Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them .
AMPC	Matthew	25	20	And he who had received the five talents came and brought him five more , saying , Master , you entrusted to me five talents ; see , here I have gained five talents more .
AMPC	Matthew	25	21	His master said to him , Well done , you upright ( honorable , [ b ] admirable ) and faithful servant ! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little ; I will put you in charge of much . Enter into and share the joy ( the delight , the [ c ] blessedness ) which your master enjoys .
AMPC	Matthew	25	22	And he also who had the two talents came forward , saying , Master , you entrusted two talents to me ; here I have gained two talents more .
AMPC	Matthew	25	23	His master said to him , Well done , you upright ( honorable , [ d ] admirable ) and faithful servant ! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little ; I will put you in charge of much . Enter into and share the joy ( the delight , the [ e ] blessedness ) which your master enjoys .
AMPC	Matthew	25	24	He who had received one talent also came forward , saying , Master , I knew you to be a harsh and hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you had not winnowed [ the grain ] .
AMPC	Matthew	25	26	But his master answered him , You wicked and lazy and idle servant ! Did you indeed know that I reap where I have not sowed and gather [ grain ] where I have not winnowed ?
AMPC	Matthew	25	27	Then you should have invested my money with the bankers , and at my coming I would have received what was my own with interest .
AMPC	Matthew	25	28	So take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents .
AMPC	Matthew	25	29	For to everyone who has will more be given , and he will be [ f ] furnished richly so that he will have an abundance ; but from the one who does not have , even what he does have will be taken away .
AMPC	Matthew	25	30	And throw the good-for-nothing servant into the outer darkness ; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth .
AMPC	Matthew	25	31	When the Son of Man comes in His glory ( His majesty and splendor ) , and all the holy angels with Him , then He will sit on the throne of His glory .
AMPC	Matthew	25	32	All nations will be gathered before Him , and He will separate them [ the people ] from one another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats ; ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	25	33	And He will cause the sheep to stand at His right hand , but the goats at His left .
AMPC	Matthew	25	34	Then the King will say to those at His right hand , Come , you blessed of My Father [ you [ g ] favored of God and appointed to eternal salvation ] , inherit ( receive as your own ) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
AMPC	Matthew	25	35	For I was hungry and you gave Me food , I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink , I was a stranger and you [ h ] brought Me together with yourselves and welcomed and entertained and [ i ] lodged Me ,
AMPC	Matthew	25	36	I was naked and you clothed Me , I was sick and you visited Me [ j ] with help and ministering care , I was in prison and you came to see Me . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	25	37	Then the just and upright will answer Him , Lord , when did we see You hungry and gave You food , or thirsty and gave You something to drink ?
AMPC	Matthew	25	38	And when did we see You a stranger and welcomed and entertained You , or naked and clothed You ?
AMPC	Matthew	25	39	And when did we see You sick or in prison and came to visit You ?
AMPC	Matthew	25	40	And the King will reply to them , Truly I tell you , in so far as you did it for one of the least [ [ k ] in the estimation of men ] of these My brethren , you did it for Me . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	25	41	Then He will say to those at His left hand , Begone from Me , you cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels !
AMPC	Matthew	25	42	For I was hungry and you gave Me no food , I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink ,
AMPC	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me and entertain Me , I was naked and you did not clothe Me , I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me [ l ] with help and ministering care .
AMPC	Matthew	25	44	Then they also [ in their turn ] will answer , Lord , when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison , and did not minister to You ?
AMPC	Matthew	25	45	And He will reply to them , Solemnly I declare to you , in so far as you failed to do it for the least [ [ m ] in the estimation of men ] of these , you failed to do it for Me . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	25	46	Then they will go away into eternal punishment , but those who are just and upright and in right standing with God into eternal life .

AMPC	Matthew	26	26	Now as they were eating , Jesus took bread and , [ e ] praising God , gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use , and when He had broken it , He gave it to the disciples and said , Take , eat ; this is My body .
AMPC	Matthew	26	2	You know that the Passover is in two days—and the Son of Man will be delivered up [ a ] treacherously to be crucified .
AMPC	Matthew	26	3	Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the [ [ b ] open ] court of the palace of the high priest , whose name was Caiaphas ,
AMPC	Matthew	26	4	And consulted together in order to arrest Jesus by stratagem secretly and put Him to death .
AMPC	Matthew	26	5	But they said , It must not be during the Feast , for fear that there will be a riot among the people .
AMPC	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus came back to Bethany and was in the house of Simon the leper ,
AMPC	Matthew	26	7	A woman came up to Him with an alabaster flask of very precious perfume , and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table .
AMPC	Matthew	26	8	And when the disciples saw it , they were indignant , saying , For what purpose is all this waste ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	9	For this perfume might have been sold for a large sum and the money given to the poor .
AMPC	Matthew	26	10	But Jesus , fully aware of this , said to them , Why do you bother the woman ? She has done a noble ( praiseworthy and beautiful ) thing to Me .
AMPC	Matthew	26	11	For you always have the poor among you , but you will not always have Me . ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	26	12	In pouring this perfume on My body she has done something to prepare Me for My burial .
AMPC	Matthew	26	13	Truly I tell you , wherever this good news ( the Gospel ) is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will be told also , in memory of her .
AMPC	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , who was called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
AMPC	Matthew	26	15	And said , What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you ? And they weighed out for and paid to him thirty pieces of silver [ about twenty-one dollars and sixty cents ] . ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	26	16	And from that moment he sought a fitting opportunity to betray Him .
AMPC	Matthew	26	17	Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread [ Passover week ] , the disciples came to Jesus and said to Him , Where do You wish us to prepare for You to eat the Passover supper ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	18	He said , Go into the city to a certain man and say to him , The Master says : My time is near ; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples .
AMPC	Matthew	26	19	And accordingly the disciples did as Jesus had directed them , and they made ready the Passover supper . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	26	20	When it was evening , He was reclining at table with the twelve disciples .
AMPC	Matthew	26	21	And as they were eating , He said , Solemnly I say to you , one of you will betray Me !
AMPC	Matthew	26	22	They were exceedingly pained and distressed and deeply hurt and sorrowful and began to say to Him one after another , [ c ] Surely it can not be I , Lord , can it ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	23	He replied , He who has [ just ] dipped his hand in the same dish with Me will betray Me !
AMPC	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man is going just as it is written of Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for that man if he had never been born ! ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	26	25	Judas , the betrayer , said , [ d ] Surely it is not I , is it , Master ? He said to him , You have stated [ the fact ] .
AMPC	Matthew	26	27	And He took a cup , and when He had given thanks , He gave it to them , saying , Drink of it , all of you ;
AMPC	Matthew	26	28	For this is My blood of the new covenant , which [ [ f ] ratifies the agreement and ] is [ g ] being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins . ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	26	29	I say to you , I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new and [ h ] of superior quality in My Father ’ s kingdom .
AMPC	Matthew	26	30	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
AMPC	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus said to them , You will all be offended and stumble and fall away because of Me this night [ distrusting and deserting Me ] , for it is written , I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . ( F )
AMPC	Matthew	26	32	But after I am raised up [ to life again ] , I will go ahead of you to Galilee .
AMPC	Matthew	26	33	Peter declared to Him , Though they all are offended and stumble and fall away because of You [ and distrust and desert You ] , I will never do so .
AMPC	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , Solemnly I declare to you , this very night , before a [ i ] single rooster crows , you will deny and disown Me three times .
AMPC	Matthew	26	35	Peter said to Him , Even if I must die with You , I will not deny or disown You ! And all the disciples said the same thing .
AMPC	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane , and He told His disciples , Sit down here while I go over yonder and pray .
AMPC	Matthew	26	37	And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , He began to [ j ] show grief and distress of mind and was [ k ] deeply depressed .
AMPC	Matthew	26	38	Then He said to them , My soul is very sad and deeply grieved , so that [ l ] I am almost dying of sorrow . Stay here and keep awake and keep watch with Me .
AMPC	Matthew	26	39	And going a little farther , He threw Himself upon the ground on His face and prayed saying , My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from Me ; nevertheless , not what I will [ not what I desire ] , but as You will and desire .
AMPC	Matthew	26	40	And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping , and He said to Peter , What ! Are you so utterly unable to stay awake and keep watch with Me for one hour ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	41	All of you must keep awake ( give strict attention , be cautious and active ) and watch and pray , that you may not come into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
AMPC	Matthew	26	42	Again a second time He went away and prayed , My Father , if this can not pass by unless I drink it , Your will be done .
AMPC	Matthew	26	43	And again He came and found them sleeping , for their eyes were weighed down with sleep .
AMPC	Matthew	26	44	So , leaving them again , He went away and prayed for the third time , using the same words .
AMPC	Matthew	26	45	Then He returned to the disciples and said to them , Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? Behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of [ m ] especially wicked sinners [ [ n ] whose way or nature it is to act in opposition to God ] .
AMPC	Matthew	26	46	Get up , let us be going ! See , My betrayer is at hand !
AMPC	Matthew	26	47	As He was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , came up , and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
AMPC	Matthew	26	48	Now the betrayer had given them a sign , saying , The One I shall kiss is the Man ; seize Him .
AMPC	Matthew	26	49	And he came up to Jesus at once and said , Hail ( greetings , good health to You , long life to You ) , Master ! And he [ o ] embraced Him and kissed Him [ p ] with [ pretended ] warmth and devotion .
AMPC	Matthew	26	50	Jesus said to him , Friend , for what are you here ? Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him .
AMPC	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of those who were with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and , striking the body servant of the high priest , cut off his ear .
AMPC	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him , Put your sword back into its place , for all who draw the sword will die by the sword . ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	26	53	Do you suppose that I can not appeal to My Father , and He will immediately provide Me with more than twelve legions [ [ q ] more than 80,000 ] of angels ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	54	But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled , that it must come about this way ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	55	At that moment Jesus said to the crowds , Have you come out with swords and clubs as [ you would ] against a robber to capture Me ? Day after day I was [ r ] accustomed to sit in the [ s ] porches and courts of the temple teaching , and you did not arrest Me .
AMPC	Matthew	26	56	But all this has taken place in order that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples deserted Him and , fleeing , escaped .
AMPC	Matthew	26	57	But those who had seized Jesus took Him away to Caiaphas , the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had assembled .
AMPC	Matthew	26	58	But Peter followed Him at a distance , as far as the courtyard of the high priest ’ s home ; he even went inside and sat with the guards to see the end .
AMPC	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole council ( the Sanhedrin ) sought to get false witnesses to testify against Jesus , so that they might put Him to death ;
AMPC	Matthew	26	60	But they found none , though many witnesses came forward [ to testify ] . At last two men came forward
AMPC	Matthew	26	61	And testified , This [ t ] Fellow said , I am able to tear down the [ u ] sanctuary of the temple of God and to build it up again in three days .
AMPC	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest stood up and said , Have You no answer to make ? What about this that these men testify against You ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus kept silent . And the high priest said to Him , [ v ] I call upon you to swear by the living God , and tell us whether you are the Christ , the Son of God .
AMPC	Matthew	26	64	Jesus said to him , [ w ] You have stated [ the fact ] . More than that , I tell you : You will in the future see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of [ x ] the Almighty and coming on the clouds of the sky . ( H )
AMPC	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his clothes and exclaimed , He has uttered blasphemy ! What need have we of further evidence ? You have now heard His blasphemy . ( I )
AMPC	Matthew	26	66	What do you think now ? They answered , He deserves to be put to death .
AMPC	Matthew	26	67	Then they spat in His face and struck Him with their fists ; and some [ y ] slapped Him in the face , ( J )
AMPC	Matthew	26	68	Saying , Prophesy to us , You Christ ( the Messiah ) ! Who was it that struck You ?
AMPC	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard , and [ z ] one maid came up to him and said , You were also with Jesus the Galilean !
AMPC	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it [ aa ] falsely before them all , saying , I do not know what you mean .
AMPC	Matthew	26	71	And when he had gone out to the porch , another maid saw him , and she said to the bystanders , This fellow was with Jesus the Nazarene !
AMPC	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it and [ ab ] disowned Him with an oath , saying , I do not know the Man !
AMPC	Matthew	26	73	After a little while , the bystanders came up and said to Peter , You certainly are one of them too , for even your accent betrays you .
AMPC	Matthew	26	74	Then Peter began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear , I do not even know the Man ! And at that moment a rooster crowed .
AMPC	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered Jesus ’ words , when He had said , Before a [ ac ] single rooster crows , you will deny and disown Me three times . And he went outside and wept bitterly .

AMPC	Matthew	27	27	Then the governor ’ s soldiers took Jesus into the palace , and they gathered the whole battalion about Him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	2	And they bound Him and led Him away and handed Him over to Pilate the governor .
AMPC	Matthew	27	3	When Judas , His betrayer , saw that [ Jesus ] was condemned , [ Judas was [ a ] afflicted in mind and troubled for his former folly ; and ] with remorse [ with little more than a selfish dread of the consequences ] he brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders , ( A )
AMPC	Matthew	27	4	Saying , I have sinned in betraying innocent blood . They replied , What is that to us ? See to that yourself .
AMPC	Matthew	27	5	And casting the pieces of silver [ forward ] into the [ Holy Place of the [ b ] sanctuary of the ] temple , he departed ; and he went off and hanged himself .
AMPC	Matthew	27	6	But the chief priests , picking up the pieces of silver , said , It is not legal to put these in the [ consecrated ] treasury , for it is the price of blood .
AMPC	Matthew	27	7	So after consultation they bought with them [ the pieces of silver ] the potter ’ s field [ as a place ] in which to bury strangers .
AMPC	Matthew	27	8	Therefore that piece of ground has been called the Field of Blood to the present day .
AMPC	Matthew	27	9	Then were fulfilled the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet when he said , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of Him on Whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel , ( B )
AMPC	Matthew	27	10	And they gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the Lord directed me .
AMPC	Matthew	27	11	Now Jesus stood before the governor [ Pilate ] , and the governor asked Him , Are you the King of the Jews ? Jesus said to him , You have stated [ the fact ] .
AMPC	Matthew	27	12	But when the charges were made against Him by the chief priests and elders , He made no answer . ( C )
AMPC	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said to Him , Do You not hear how many and how serious are the things they are testifying against You ?
AMPC	Matthew	27	14	But He made no reply to him , not even to a single accusation , so that the governor marveled greatly .
AMPC	Matthew	27	15	Now at the Feast [ of the Passover ] the governor was in the habit of setting free for the people any one prisoner whom they chose .
AMPC	Matthew	27	16	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner whose name was Barabbas .
AMPC	Matthew	27	17	So when they had assembled for this purpose , Pilate said to them , Whom do you want me to set free for you , Barabbas , or Jesus Who is called Christ ?
AMPC	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that it was because of envy that they had handed Him over to him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	19	Also , while he was seated on the judgment bench , his wife sent him a message , saying , Have nothing to do with that just and upright Man , for I have had a painful experience today in a dream because of Him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders prevailed on the people to ask for Barabbas , and put Jesus to death .
AMPC	Matthew	27	21	Again the governor said to them , Which of the two do you wish me to release for you ? And they said , Barabbas !
AMPC	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them , Then what shall I do with Jesus Who is called Christ ?
AMPC	Matthew	27	23	They all replied , Let Him be crucified ! And he said , Why ? What has He done that is evil ? But they shouted all the louder , Let Him be crucified !
AMPC	Matthew	27	24	So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere , but rather that a riot was about to break out , he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd , saying , I am not guilty of nor responsible for this [ c ] righteous Man ’ s blood ; see to it yourselves . ( D )
AMPC	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answered , Let His blood be on us and on our children ! ( E )
AMPC	Matthew	27	26	So he set free for them Barabbas ; and he [ had ] Jesus whipped , and delivered Him up to be crucified .
AMPC	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped off His clothes and put a scarlet robe ( [ d ] garment of dignity and office worn by Roman officers of rank ) upon Him ,
AMPC	Matthew	27	29	And , weaving a crown of thorns , they put it on His head and put a reed ( staff ) in His right hand . And kneeling before Him , they made sport of Him , saying , Hail ( greetings , good health to You , long life to You ) , King of the Jews !
AMPC	Matthew	27	30	And they spat on Him , and took the reed ( staff ) and struck Him on the head .
AMPC	Matthew	27	31	And when they finished making sport of Him , they stripped Him of the robe and put His own garments on Him and led Him away to be crucified .
AMPC	Matthew	27	32	As they were marching forth , they came upon a man of Cyrene named Simon ; this man they forced to carry the cross of Jesus .
AMPC	Matthew	27	33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha [ Latin : Calvary ] , which means The Place of a Skull ,
AMPC	Matthew	27	34	They offered Him wine mingled with gall to drink ; but when He tasted it , He refused to drink it .

AMPC	Matthew	27	36	Then they sat down there and kept watch over Him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	37	And over His head they put the accusation against Him ( [ f ] the cause of His death ) , which read , This is Jesus , the King of the Jews .
AMPC	Matthew	27	38	At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him , one on the right hand and one on the left .
AMPC	Matthew	27	39	And those who passed by spoke reproachfully and abusively and jeered at Him , wagging their heads , ( G )
AMPC	Matthew	27	40	And they said , You Who would tear down the [ g ] sanctuary of the temple and rebuild it in three days , rescue Yourself [ h ] from death . If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross .
AMPC	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests , with the scribes and elders , made sport of Him , saying ,
AMPC	Matthew	27	42	He rescued others [ i ] from death ; Himself He can not rescue [ j ] from death . He is the King of Israel ? Let Him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in and [ k ] acknowledge and cleave to Him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	43	He trusts in God ; let God deliver Him now if He cares for Him and will have Him , for He said , I am the Son of God .
AMPC	Matthew	27	44	And the robbers who were crucified with Him also abused and reproached and made sport of Him in the same way .
AMPC	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour ( noon ) there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour ( three o ’ clock ) .
AMPC	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour ( three o ’ clock ) Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? —that is , My God , My God , why have You abandoned Me [ leaving Me [ l ] helpless , forsaking and failing Me in My need ] ? ( H )
AMPC	Matthew	27	47	And some of the bystanders , when they heard it , said , This Man is calling for Elijah !
AMPC	Matthew	27	48	And one of them immediately ran and took a sponge , soaked it with vinegar ( a sour wine ) , and put it on a reed ( staff ) , and was [ m ] about to give it to Him to drink . ( I )
AMPC	Matthew	27	49	But the others said , Wait ! Let us see whether Elijah will come to save Him [ n ] from death .
AMPC	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and gave up His spirit .
AMPC	Matthew	27	51	And at once the curtain of the [ o ] sanctuary of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom ; the earth shook and the rocks were split . ( J )
AMPC	Matthew	27	52	The tombs were opened and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep [ p ] in death were raised [ to life ] ;
AMPC	Matthew	27	53	And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection , they went into the holy city and appeared to many people .
AMPC	Matthew	27	54	When the centurion and those who were with him keeping watch over Jesus observed the earthquake and all that was happening , they were terribly frightened and filled with awe , and said , Truly this was God ’ s Son !
AMPC	Matthew	27	55	There were also numerous women there , looking on from a distance , who were of those who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee , ministering to Him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	56	Among them were Mary of Magdala , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of Zebedee ’ s sons .
AMPC	Matthew	27	57	When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea , named Joseph , who also was a disciple of Jesus .
AMPC	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus , and Pilate ordered that it be given to him .
AMPC	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body and [ q ] rolled it up in a clean linen cloth [ r ] used for swathing dead bodies
AMPC	Matthew	27	60	And laid it in his own fresh ( [ s ] undefiled ) tomb , which he had hewn in the rock ; and he rolled a big boulder over the door of the tomb and went away .
AMPC	Matthew	27	61	And Mary of Magdala and the other Mary kept sitting there opposite the tomb .
AMPC	Matthew	27	62	The next day , that is , the day after the day of Preparation [ for the Sabbath ] , the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate
AMPC	Matthew	27	63	And said , Sir , we have just remembered how that [ t ] vagabond Imposter said while He was still alive , After three days I will rise again .
AMPC	Matthew	27	64	Therefore give an order to have the tomb made secure and safeguarded until the third day , for fear that His disciples will come and steal Him away and tell the people that He has risen from the dead , and the last deception and fraud will be worse than the first .
AMPC	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , You have a guard [ of soldiers ; take them and ] go , make it as secure as you can .
AMPC	Matthew	27	66	So they went off and made the tomb secure by sealing the boulder , a guard of soldiers being with them and remaining to watch .

AMPC	Matthew	28	28	Now after the Sabbath , near dawn of the first day of the week , Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb .
AMPC	Matthew	28	2	And behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the boulder back and sat upon it .
AMPC	Matthew	28	3	His appearance was like lightning , and his garments as white as snow .
AMPC	Matthew	28	4	And those keeping guard were so frightened at the sight of him that they were agitated and they trembled and became like dead men .
AMPC	Matthew	28	5	But the angel said to the women , Do not be alarmed and frightened , for I know that you are looking for Jesus , Who was crucified .
AMPC	Matthew	28	6	He is not here ; He has risen , as He said [ He would do ] . Come , see the place where He lay .
AMPC	Matthew	28	7	Then go quickly and tell His disciples , He has risen from the dead , and behold , He is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see Him . Behold , I have told you .
AMPC	Matthew	28	8	So they left the tomb hastily with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples .
AMPC	Matthew	28	9	And as they went , behold , Jesus met them and said , Hail ( greetings ) ! And they went up to Him and clasped His feet and worshiped Him .
AMPC	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them , Do not be alarmed and afraid ; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee , and there they will see Me .
AMPC	Matthew	28	11	While they were on their way , behold , some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had occurred .
AMPC	Matthew	28	12	And when they [ the chief priests ] had gathered with the elders and had consulted together , they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers ,
AMPC	Matthew	28	13	And said , Tell people , His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping .
AMPC	Matthew	28	14	And if the governor hears of it , we will appease him and make you safe and free from trouble and care .
AMPC	Matthew	28	15	So they took the money and did as they were instructed ; and this story has been current among the Jews to the present day .
AMPC	Matthew	28	16	Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain to which Jesus had directed and made appointment with them .
AMPC	Matthew	28	17	And when they saw Him , they fell down and worshiped Him ; but some doubted .
AMPC	Matthew	28	18	Jesus approached and , [ a ] breaking the silence , said to them , All authority ( all power of rule ) in heaven and on earth has been given to Me .
AMPC	Matthew	28	19	Go then and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them [ b ] into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
AMPC	Matthew	28	20	Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you , and behold , I am with you [ c ] all the days ( [ d ] perpetually , uniformly , and on every occasion ) , to the [ very ] close and consummation of the age . [ e ] Amen ( so let it be ) .

AMPC	Mark	1	1	The beginning [ of the facts ] of the good news ( the Gospel ) of Jesus Christ , [ a ] the Son of God .
AMPC	Mark	1	2	[ b ] Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah : Behold , I send My messenger before Your face , who will make ready Your way— ( A )
AMPC	Mark	1	3	A voice of one crying in the wilderness [ shouting in the desert ] , Prepare the way of the Lord , make His [ c ] beaten tracks straight ( level and passable ) ! ( B )
AMPC	Mark	1	4	John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness ( desert ) , preaching a baptism [ [ d ] obligating ] repentance ( [ e ] a change of one ’ s mind for the better , heartily amending one ’ s ways , with abhorrence of his past sins ) in order [ f ] to obtain forgiveness of and release from sins .
AMPC	Mark	1	5	And there kept going out to him [ continuously ] all the country of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan , [ g ] as they were confessing their sins .
AMPC	Mark	1	6	And John wore clothing woven of camel ’ s hair and had a leather girdle around his loins and ate locusts and wild honey .
AMPC	Mark	1	7	And he preached , saying , After me comes He Who is stronger ( more powerful and more valiant ) than I , the strap of Whose sandals I am not worthy or fit to stoop down and unloose .
AMPC	Mark	1	8	I have baptized you with water , but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Mark	1	9	In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
AMPC	Mark	1	10	And when He came up out of the water , at once he [ John ] saw the heavens torn open and the [ Holy ] Spirit like a dove coming down [ [ h ] to enter ] [ i ] into Him . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	1	11	And there came a voice [ j ] out from within heaven , You are My Beloved Son ; in You I am well pleased . ( D )
AMPC	Mark	1	12	Immediately the [ Holy ] Spirit [ from within ] drove Him out into the wilderness ( desert ) ,
AMPC	Mark	1	13	And He stayed in the wilderness ( desert ) forty days , being tempted [ all the while ] by Satan ; and He was with the wild beasts , and the angels ministered to Him [ continually ] .
AMPC	Mark	1	14	Now after John was arrested and put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God ,
AMPC	Mark	1	15	And saying , The [ appointed period of ] time is fulfilled ( completed ) , and the kingdom of God is at hand ; repent ( [ k ] have a change of mind which issues in regret for past sins and in change of conduct for the better ) and believe ( trust in , rely on , and adhere to ) the good news ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	Mark	1	16	And passing along the shore of the Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon [ Peter ] and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net [ to and fro ] in the sea , for they were fishermen .
AMPC	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them , Come after Me and [ l ] be My disciples , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
AMPC	Mark	1	18	And at once they left their nets and [ [ m ] yielding up all claim to them ] followed [ with ] Him [ [ n ] joining Him as disciples and siding with His party ] .
AMPC	Mark	1	19	He went on a little farther and saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who were in [ their ] boat putting their nets in order .
AMPC	Mark	1	20	And immediately He called out to them , and [ [ o ] abandoning all mutual claims ] they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went off after Him [ [ p ] to be His disciples , side with His party , and follow Him ] .
AMPC	Mark	1	21	And they entered into Capernaum , and immediately on the Sabbath He went into the synagogue and began to teach .
AMPC	Mark	1	22	And they were completely astonished at His teaching , for He was teaching as One Who possessed authority , and not as the scribes .
AMPC	Mark	1	23	Just at that time there was in their synagogue a man [ who was in the power ] of an unclean spirit ; and now [ immediately ] he raised a deep and terrible cry from the depths of his throat , saying ,
AMPC	Mark	1	24	What have You to do with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are—the Holy One of God !
AMPC	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hush up ( be muzzled , gagged ) , and come out of him !
AMPC	Mark	1	26	And the unclean spirit , throwing the man into convulsions and [ q ] screeching with a loud voice , came out of him .
AMPC	Mark	1	27	And they were all so amazed and [ r ] almost terrified that they kept questioning and demanding one of another , saying , What is this ? What new ( fresh ) teaching ! With authority He gives orders even to the unclean spirits and they obey Him !
AMPC	Mark	1	28	And immediately rumors concerning Him spread [ everywhere ] throughout all the region surrounding Galilee .
AMPC	Mark	1	29	And at once He left the synagogue and went into the house of Simon [ Peter ] and Andrew , accompanied by James and John .
AMPC	Mark	1	30	Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law [ s ] had for some time been lying sick with a fever , and at once they told Him about her .
AMPC	Mark	1	31	And He went up to her and took her by the hand and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she began to wait on them .
AMPC	Mark	1	32	Now when it was evening , after the sun had set , they brought to Him all who were sick and those under the power of demons ,
AMPC	Mark	1	33	Until the whole town was gathered together about the door .
AMPC	Mark	1	34	And He cured many who were afflicted with various diseases ; and He drove out many demons , but would not allow the demons to talk because they knew Him [ [ t ] intuitively ] .
AMPC	Mark	1	35	And in the morning , long before daylight , He got up and went out to a [ u ] deserted place , and there He prayed .
AMPC	Mark	1	36	And Simon [ Peter ] and those who were with him followed Him [ [ v ] pursuing Him eagerly and hunting Him out ] ,
AMPC	Mark	1	37	And they found Him and said to Him , Everybody is looking for You .
AMPC	Mark	1	38	And He said to them , Let us be going on into the neighboring country towns , that I may preach there also ; for that is why I came out .
AMPC	Mark	1	39	[ So ] He went throughout the whole of Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons .
AMPC	Mark	1	40	And a leper came to Him , begging Him on his knees and saying to Him , If You are willing , You are able to make me clean .
AMPC	Mark	1	41	And being moved with pity and sympathy , Jesus reached out His hand and touched him , and said to him , I am willing ; be made clean !
AMPC	Mark	1	42	And at once the leprosy [ completely ] left him and he was made clean [ by being healed ] .
AMPC	Mark	1	43	And Jesus charged him sternly ( sharply and threateningly , and with earnest admonition ) and [ acting with deep feeling thrust him forth and ] sent him away at once ,
AMPC	Mark	1	44	And said to him , See that you tell nothing [ of this ] to anyone ; but begone , show yourself to the priest , and offer for your purification what Moses commanded , as a proof ( an evidence and witness ) to the people [ that you are really healed ] . ( E )
AMPC	Mark	1	45	But he went out and began to talk so freely about it and blaze abroad the news [ spreading it everywhere ] that [ Jesus ] could no longer openly go into a town but was outside in [ lonely ] desert places . But the people kept on coming to Him from [ w ] all sides and every quarter .

AMPC	Mark	2	2	And so many people gathered together there that there was no longer room [ for them ] , not even around the door ; and He was discussing the Word .
AMPC	Mark	2	3	Then they came , bringing a paralytic to Him , who had been picked up and was being carried by four men .
AMPC	Mark	2	4	And when they could not get him to a place in front of Jesus because of the throng , they dug through the roof above Him ; and when they had [ a ] scooped out an opening , they let down the [ [ b ] thickly padded ] quilt or mat upon which the paralyzed man lay .
AMPC	Mark	2	5	And when Jesus saw their faith [ their confidence in God through Him ] , He said to the paralyzed man , Son , your sins are forgiven [ you ] and put away [ that is , the [ c ] penalty is remitted , the sense of guilt removed , and you are made upright and in right standing with God ] .
AMPC	Mark	2	6	Now some of the scribes were sitting there , holding a dialogue with themselves as they questioned in their hearts ,
AMPC	Mark	2	7	Why does this [ d ] Man talk like this ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins [ [ e ] remove guilt , remit the penalty , and bestow righteousness instead ] except God alone ?
AMPC	Mark	2	8	And at once Jesus , becoming fully aware in His spirit that they thus debated within themselves , said to them , Why do you argue ( debate , reason ) about all this in your hearts ?
AMPC	Mark	2	9	Which is easier : to say to the paralyzed man , Your sins are forgiven and [ f ] put away , or to say , Rise , take up your sleeping pad or mat , and start walking about [ and [ g ] keep on walking ] ?
AMPC	Mark	2	10	But that you may know positively and beyond a doubt that the Son of Man has right and authority and power on earth to forgive sins—He said to the paralyzed man ,
AMPC	Mark	2	11	I say to you , arise , pick up and carry your sleeping pad or mat , and be going on home .
AMPC	Mark	2	12	And he arose at once and picked up the sleeping pad or mat and went out before them all , so that they were all amazed and [ h ] recognized and praised and thanked God , saying , We have never seen anything like this before !
AMPC	Mark	2	13	[ Jesus ] went out again along the seashore ; and all the multitude kept gathering about Him , and He kept teaching them .
AMPC	Mark	2	14	And as He was passing by , He saw Levi ( Matthew ) son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office , and He said to him , Follow Me ! [ Be [ i ] joined to Me as a disciple , side with My party ! ] And he arose and joined Him as His disciple and sided with His party and accompanied Him .
AMPC	Mark	2	15	And as Jesus , together with His disciples , sat at table in his [ Levi ’ s ] house , many tax collectors and persons [ [ j ] definitely stained ] with sin were dining with Him , for there were many who walked the same road ( followed ) with Him .
AMPC	Mark	2	16	And the scribes [ belonging to the party ] of the Pharisees , when they saw that He was eating with [ those [ k ] definitely known to be especially wicked ] sinners and tax collectors , said to His disciples , Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and [ notorious ] sinners ?
AMPC	Mark	2	17	And when Jesus heard it , He said to them , Those who are strong and well have no need of a physician , but those who are weak and sick ; I came not to call the righteous ones to repentance , but sinners ( the [ l ] erring ones and [ m ] all those not free from sin ) .
AMPC	Mark	2	18	Now John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were observing a fast ; and [ some people ] came and asked Jesus , Why are John ’ s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting , but Your disciples are not doing so ?
AMPC	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered them , Can the wedding guests fast ( abstain from food and drink ) while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
AMPC	Mark	2	20	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them , and they will fast in that day .
AMPC	Mark	2	21	No one sews a patch of unshrunken ( new ) goods on an old garment ; if he does , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and the rent ( tear ) becomes bigger and worse [ than it was before ] .
AMPC	Mark	2	22	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the wine will burst the skins , and the wine is lost and the bottles destroyed ; but new wine is to be put in new ( fresh ) wineskins .
AMPC	Mark	2	23	One Sabbath He was going along beside the fields of standing grain , and as they made their way , His disciples began to [ n ] pick off the grains . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said to Him , Look ! Why are they doing what is not permitted or lawful on the Sabbath ?
AMPC	Mark	2	25	And He said to them , Have you never [ even ] read what David did when he was in need and was hungry , he and those who were accompanying him ? —
AMPC	Mark	2	26	How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was the high priest , and ate the sacred loaves set forth [ before God ] , which it is not permitted or lawful for any but the priests to eat , and [ how he ] also gave [ them ] to those who were with him ? ( B )
AMPC	Mark	2	27	And Jesus said to them , The Sabbath was made on account and for the sake of man , not man for the Sabbath ; ( C )
AMPC	Mark	2	28	So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath .

AMPC	Mark	3	3	And He said to the man who had the withered hand , Get up [ and stand here ] in the midst .
AMPC	Mark	3	2	And [ the Pharisees ] kept watching Jesus [ closely ] to see whether He would cure him on the Sabbath , so that they might get a charge to bring against Him [ [ b ] formally ] .
AMPC	Mark	3	4	And He said to them , Is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to take it ? But they kept silence .
AMPC	Mark	3	5	And He glanced around at them with vexation and anger , grieved at the hardening of their hearts , and said to the man , Hold out your hand . He held it out , and his hand was [ completely ] restored .
AMPC	Mark	3	6	Then the Pharisees went out and immediately held a consultation with the Herodians against Him , how they might [ devise some means to ] put Him to death .
AMPC	Mark	3	7	And Jesus retired with His disciples to the lake , and a great throng from Galilee followed Him . Also from Judea
AMPC	Mark	3	8	And from Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon—a vast multitude , hearing all the many things that He was doing , came to Him .
AMPC	Mark	3	9	And He told His disciples to have a little boat in [ constant ] readiness for Him because of the crowd , lest they press hard upon Him and crush Him .
AMPC	Mark	3	10	For He had healed so many that all who had distressing bodily diseases kept falling upon Him and pressing upon Him in order that they might touch Him .
AMPC	Mark	3	11	And the spirits , the unclean ones , [ c ] as often as they might see Him , fell down before Him and kept screaming out , You are the Son of God !
AMPC	Mark	3	12	And He charged them strictly and severely under penalty again and again that they should not make Him known .
AMPC	Mark	3	13	And He went up on the hillside and called to Him [ [ d ] for Himself ] those whom He wanted and chose , and they came to Him .
AMPC	Mark	3	14	And He appointed twelve to [ e ] continue to be with Him , and that He might send them out to preach [ as apostles or special messengers ]
AMPC	Mark	3	15	And to have authority and power to heal the sick and to drive out demons :
AMPC	Mark	3	16	[ They were ] Simon , and He surnamed [ him ] Peter ;
AMPC	Mark	3	17	James son of Zebedee and John the brother of James , and He surnamed them Boanerges , that is , Sons of Thunder ;
AMPC	Mark	3	18	And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew ( Nathaniel ) , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ( Judas , not Iscariot ) , and Simon the Cananaean [ also called Zelotes ] ,
AMPC	Mark	3	19	And Judas Iscariot , he who betrayed Him .
AMPC	Mark	3	20	Then He went to a house [ probably Peter ’ s ] , but a throng came together again , so that Jesus and His disciples could not even take food .
AMPC	Mark	3	21	And when those [ f ] who belonged to Him ( [ g ] His kinsmen ) heard it , they went out to take Him by force , for they kept saying , He is out of [ h ] His mind ( beside Himself , deranged ) !
AMPC	Mark	3	22	And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , He is possessed by Beelzebub , and , By [ the help of ] the prince of demons He is casting out demons .
AMPC	Mark	3	23	And He summoned them to Him and said to them in parables ( illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them ) , How can Satan drive out Satan ?
AMPC	Mark	3	24	And if a kingdom is divided and rebelling against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
AMPC	Mark	3	25	And if a house is divided ( split into factions and rebelling ) against itself , that house will not be able to last .
AMPC	Mark	3	26	And if Satan has raised an insurrection against himself and is divided , he can not stand but is [ surely ] coming to an end .
AMPC	Mark	3	27	But no one can go into a strong man ’ s house and ransack his household goods right and left and seize them as plunder unless he first binds the strong man ; then indeed he may [ thoroughly ] plunder his house . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	3	28	Truly and solemnly I say to you , all sins will be forgiven the sons of men , and whatever abusive and blasphemous things they utter ;
AMPC	Mark	3	29	But whoever speaks abusively against or maliciously misrepresents the Holy Spirit can never get forgiveness , but is guilty of and is in the grasp of [ i ] an everlasting trespass .
AMPC	Mark	3	30	For they [ j ] persisted in saying , [ k ] He has an unclean spirit .
AMPC	Mark	3	31	Then His mother and His brothers came and , standing outside , they sent word to Him , calling [ for ] Him .
AMPC	Mark	3	32	And a crowd was sitting around Him , and they said to Him , Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside asking for You .
AMPC	Mark	3	33	And He replied , Who are My mother and My brothers ?
AMPC	Mark	3	34	And looking around on those who sat in a circle about Him , He said , See ! Here are My mother and My brothers ;
AMPC	Mark	3	35	For whoever does the things God wills is My brother and sister and mother !

AMPC	Mark	4	4	And as he was sowing , some seed fell along the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
AMPC	Mark	4	2	And He taught them many things in parables ( illustrations or comparisons put beside truths to explain them ) , and in His teaching He said to them :
AMPC	Mark	4	3	Give attention to this ! Behold , a sower went out to sow .
AMPC	Mark	4	5	Other seed [ of the same kind ] fell on ground full of rocks , where it had not much soil ; and at once it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil ;
AMPC	Mark	4	6	And when the sun came up , it was scorched , and because it had not taken root , it withered away .
AMPC	Mark	4	7	Other seed [ of the same kind ] fell among thorn plants , and the thistles grew and pressed together and utterly choked and suffocated it , and it yielded no grain .
AMPC	Mark	4	8	And other seed [ of the same kind ] fell into good ( well-adapted ) soil and brought forth grain , growing up and increasing , and yielded up to thirty times as much , and sixty times as much , and even a hundred times as much as had been sown .
AMPC	Mark	4	9	And He said , He who has ears to hear , let him be hearing [ and let him [ a ] consider , and comprehend ] .
AMPC	Mark	4	10	And as soon as He was alone , those who were around Him , with the Twelve [ apostles ] , began to ask Him about the parables .
AMPC	Mark	4	11	And He said to them , To you has been entrusted the mystery of the kingdom of God [ that is , [ b ] the secret counsels of God which are hidden from the ungodly ] ; but for those outside [ [ c ] of our circle ] everything becomes a parable ,
AMPC	Mark	4	12	In order that they may [ indeed ] look and look but not see and perceive , and may hear and hear but not grasp and comprehend , [ d ] lest haply they should turn again , and it [ [ e ] their willful rejection of the truth ] should be forgiven them . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	4	13	And He said to them , Do you not discern and understand this parable ? How then is it possible for you to discern and understand all the parables ?
AMPC	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the Word .
AMPC	Mark	4	15	The ones along the path are those who have the Word sown [ in their hearts ] , but when they hear , Satan comes at once and [ by force ] takes away the message which is sown in them .
AMPC	Mark	4	16	And in the same way the ones sown upon stony ground are those who , when they hear the Word , at once receive and accept and welcome it with joy ;
AMPC	Mark	4	17	And they have no real root in themselves , and so they endure for a little while ; then when trouble or persecution arises on account of the Word , they immediately are offended ( become displeased , indignant , resentful ) and they stumble and fall away .
AMPC	Mark	4	18	And the ones sown among the thorns are others who hear the Word ;
AMPC	Mark	4	19	Then the cares and anxieties of the world and distractions of the age , and the pleasure and delight and false glamour and deceitfulness of riches , and the craving and passionate desire for other things creep in and choke and suffocate the Word , and it becomes fruitless .
AMPC	Mark	4	20	And those sown on the good ( well-adapted ) soil are the ones who hear the Word and receive and accept and welcome it and bear fruit—some thirty times as much as was sown , some sixty times as much , and some [ even ] a hundred times as much .
AMPC	Mark	4	21	And He said to them , Is the lamp brought in to be put under a [ f ] peck measure or under a bed , and not [ to be put ] on the lampstand ?
AMPC	Mark	4	22	[ [ g ] Things are hidden temporarily only as a means to revelation . ] For there is nothing hidden except to be revealed , nor is anything [ temporarily ] kept secret except in order that it may be made known .
AMPC	Mark	4	23	If any man has ears to hear , let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend .
AMPC	Mark	4	24	And He said to them , Be careful what you are hearing . The measure [ h ] [ of thought and study ] you give [ to [ i ] the truth you hear ] will be the measure [ j ] [ of virtue and knowledge ] that comes back to you—and more [ besides ] will be given to you who hear .
AMPC	Mark	4	25	For to him who has will more be given ; and from him who has nothing , even what he has will be taken away [ [ k ] by force ] ,
AMPC	Mark	4	26	And He said , The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed upon the ground ,
AMPC	Mark	4	27	And then continues sleeping and rising night and day while the seed sprouts and grows and [ l ] increases—he knows not how .
AMPC	Mark	4	28	The earth produces [ acting ] by itself—first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
AMPC	Mark	4	29	But when the grain is ripe and permits , immediately he [ m ] sends forth [ the reapers ] and puts in the sickle , because the harvest stands ready .
AMPC	Mark	4	30	And He said , With what can we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it ?
AMPC	Mark	4	31	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when sown upon the ground , is the smallest of all seeds upon the earth ;
AMPC	Mark	4	32	Yet after it is sown , it grows up and becomes the greatest of all garden herbs and puts out large branches , so that the birds of the air are able to make nests and dwell in its shade .
AMPC	Mark	4	33	With many such parables [ Jesus ] spoke the Word to them , as they were able to hear and [ n ] to comprehend and understand .
AMPC	Mark	4	34	He did not tell them anything without a parable ; but privately to His disciples ( [ o ] those who were peculiarly His own ) He explained everything [ fully ] .
AMPC	Mark	4	35	On that same day [ when ] evening had come , He said to them , Let us go over to the other side [ of the lake ] .
AMPC	Mark	4	36	And leaving the throng , they took Him with them , [ just ] as He was , in the boat [ in which He was sitting ] . And other boats were with Him .
AMPC	Mark	4	37	And a furious storm of wind [ [ p ] of hurricane proportions ] arose , and the waves kept beating into the boat , so that it was already becoming filled .
AMPC	Mark	4	38	But He [ Himself ] was in the stern [ of the boat ] , asleep on the [ leather ] cushion ; and they awoke Him and said to Him , Master , do You not care that we are perishing ?
AMPC	Mark	4	39	And He arose and rebuked the wind and said to the sea , Hush now ! Be still ( muzzled ) ! And the wind ceased ( [ q ] sank to rest as if exhausted by its beating ) and there was [ immediately ] a great calm ( [ r ] a perfect peacefulness ) .
AMPC	Mark	4	40	He said to them , Why are you so timid and fearful ? How is it that you have no faith ( no [ s ] firmly relying trust ) ?
AMPC	Mark	4	41	And they were filled with great awe and [ t ] feared exceedingly and said one to another , Who then is this , that even wind and sea obey Him ?

AMPC	Mark	5	5	Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always [ c ] shrieking and screaming and [ d ] beating and bruising and [ e ] cutting himself with stones .
AMPC	Mark	5	2	And as soon as He got out of the boat , there met Him out of the tombs a man [ under the power ] of an unclean spirit .
AMPC	Mark	5	3	This man [ a ] continually lived among the tombs , and no one could subdue him any more , even with a chain ;
AMPC	Mark	5	4	For he had been bound often with shackles for the feet and [ b ] handcuffs , but the handcuffs of [ light ] chains he wrenched apart , and the shackles he rubbed and ground together and broke in pieces ; and no one had strength enough to restrain or tame him .
AMPC	Mark	5	6	And when from a distance he saw Jesus , he ran and fell on his knees before Him in homage ,
AMPC	Mark	5	7	And crying out with a loud voice , he said , What have You to do with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? [ What is there in common between us ? ] I [ f ] solemnly implore you by God , do not begin to torment me !
AMPC	Mark	5	8	For Jesus was commanding , Come out of the man , you unclean spirit !
AMPC	Mark	5	9	And He asked him , What is your name ? He replied , My name is Legion , for we are many .
AMPC	Mark	5	10	And he kept begging Him urgently not to send them [ himself and the other demons ] away out of that region .
AMPC	Mark	5	11	Now a great herd of hogs was grazing there on the hillside .
AMPC	Mark	5	12	And the demons begged Him , saying , Send us to the hogs , that we may go into them !
AMPC	Mark	5	13	So He gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out [ of the man ] and entered into the hogs ; and the herd , numbering about 2,000 , rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea .
AMPC	Mark	5	14	The hog feeders ran away , and told [ it ] in the town and in the country . And [ the people ] came to see what it was that had taken place .
AMPC	Mark	5	15	And they came to Jesus and looked intently and searchingly at the man who had been a demoniac , sitting there , clothed and in his right mind , [ the same man ] who had had the legion [ of demons ] ; and they were [ g ] seized with alarm and struck with fear .
AMPC	Mark	5	16	And those who had seen it related in full what had happened to the man possessed by demons and to the hogs .
AMPC	Mark	5	17	And they began to beg [ Jesus ] to leave their neighborhood .
AMPC	Mark	5	18	And when He had stepped into the boat , the man who had been controlled by the unclean spirits kept begging Him that he might be with Him .
AMPC	Mark	5	19	But Jesus refused to permit him , but said to him , Go home to your own [ family and relatives and friends ] and bring back word to them of how much the Lord has done for you , and [ how He has ] had sympathy for you and mercy on you .
AMPC	Mark	5	20	And he departed and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [ the region of the ten cities ] how much Jesus had done for him , and all the people were astonished and marveled . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	5	21	And when Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the other side , a great throng gathered about Him , and He was at the lakeshore .
AMPC	Mark	5	22	Then one of the rulers of the synagogue came up , Jairus by name ; and seeing Him , he prostrated himself at His feet
AMPC	Mark	5	23	And begged Him earnestly , saying , My little daughter is at the point of death . Come and lay Your hands on her , so that she may be healed and live .
AMPC	Mark	5	24	And Jesus went with him ; and a great crowd kept following Him and pressed Him [ h ] from all sides [ so as almost to suffocate Him ] .
AMPC	Mark	5	25	And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years ,
AMPC	Mark	5	26	And who had endured much [ i ] suffering under [ the hands of ] many physicians and had spent all that she had , and was no better but instead grew worse .
AMPC	Mark	5	27	She had heard the reports concerning Jesus , and she came up behind Him in the throng and touched His garment ,
AMPC	Mark	5	28	For she kept saying , If I only touch His garments , I shall be restored to health .
AMPC	Mark	5	29	And immediately her flow of blood was dried up at the source , and [ [ j ] suddenly ] she felt in her body that she was healed of her [ [ k ] distressing ] ailment .
AMPC	Mark	5	30	And Jesus , recognizing in Himself that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth , turned around immediately in the crowd and said , Who touched My clothes ?
AMPC	Mark	5	31	And the disciples kept saying to Him , You see the crowd pressing hard around You [ l ] from all sides , and You ask , Who touched Me ?
AMPC	Mark	5	32	Still He kept looking around to see her who had done it .
AMPC	Mark	5	33	But the woman , knowing what had been done for her , though alarmed and frightened and trembling , fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
AMPC	Mark	5	34	And He said to her , Daughter , your faith ( your [ m ] trust and confidence in Me , springing from faith in God ) has restored you to health . Go in [ n ] ( into ) peace and be continually healed and freed from your [ [ o ] distressing bodily ] disease .
AMPC	Mark	5	35	While He was still speaking , there came some from the ruler ’ s house , who said [ to Jairus ] , Your daughter has died . Why bother and distress the Teacher any further ?
AMPC	Mark	5	36	[ p ] Overhearing but ignoring what they said , Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue , Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear ; only keep on believing .
AMPC	Mark	5	37	And He permitted no one to accompany Him except Peter and James and John the brother of James .
AMPC	Mark	5	38	When they arrived at the house of the ruler of the synagogue , He [ q ] looked [ carefully and with understanding ] at [ the ] tumult and the people weeping and wailing loudly .
AMPC	Mark	5	39	And when He had gone in , He said to them , Why do you make an uproar and weep ? The little girl is not dead but is sleeping .
AMPC	Mark	5	40	And they laughed and [ r ] jeered at Him . But He put them all out , and , taking the child ’ s father and mother and those who were with Him , He went in where the little girl was lying .
AMPC	Mark	5	41	Gripping her [ firmly ] by the hand , He said to her , Talitha cumi—which translated is , Little girl , I say to you , arise [ [ s ] from the sleep of death ] !
AMPC	Mark	5	42	And instantly the girl got up and started walking around—for she was twelve years old . And they were utterly astonished and overcome with amazement .
AMPC	Mark	5	43	And He strictly commanded and warned them that no one should know this , and He [ [ t ] expressly ] told them to give her [ something ] to eat .

AMPC	Mark	6	6	And He marveled because of their unbelief ( their lack of faith in Him ) . And He went about among the surrounding villages and continued teaching .
AMPC	Mark	6	2	And on the Sabbath He began to teach in the synagogue ; and many who listened to Him were utterly astonished , saying , Where did this [ a ] Man acquire all this ? What is the wisdom [ the broad and full intelligence which has been ] given to Him ? What mighty works and exhibitions of power are wrought by His hands !
AMPC	Mark	6	3	Is not this the Carpenter , the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? And are not His sisters here among us ? And they took offense at Him and [ b ] were hurt [ that is , they [ c ] disapproved of Him , and it hindered them from acknowledging His authority ] and they were caused to stumble and fall .
AMPC	Mark	6	4	But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honor ( deference , reverence ) except in his [ own ] country and among [ his ] relatives and in his [ own ] house .
AMPC	Mark	6	5	And He was not able to do [ d ] even one work of power there , except that He laid His hands on a few sickly people [ and ] cured them .
AMPC	Mark	6	7	And He called to Him the Twelve [ apostles ] and began to send them out [ as His ambassadors ] two by two and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits .
AMPC	Mark	6	8	He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick—no bread , [ e ] no wallet for a collection bag , no money in their belts ( girdles , purses ) —
AMPC	Mark	6	9	But to go with sandals on their feet and not to put on two tunics ( undergarments ) .
AMPC	Mark	6	10	And He told them , Wherever you go into a house , stay there until you leave that place .

AMPC	Mark	6	12	So they went out and preached that men should repent [ [ g ] that they should change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	13	And they drove out many unclean spirits and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them .
AMPC	Mark	6	14	King Herod heard of it , for [ Jesus ’ ] name had become well known . [ h ] He and they [ of his court ] said , John the Baptist has been raised from the dead ; that is why these mighty powers [ [ i ] of performing miracles ] are at work in Him .
AMPC	Mark	6	15	[ But ] others kept saying , It is Elijah ! And others said , It is a prophet , like one of the prophets [ of old ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard [ of it ] , he said , [ [ j ] This very ] John , whom I beheaded , has been raised [ from the dead ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	17	For [ this ] Herod himself had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife , because he [ Herod ] had married her .
AMPC	Mark	6	18	For John had told Herod , It is not lawful and you have no right to have your brother ’ s wife .
AMPC	Mark	6	19	And Herodias was angry ( enraged ) with him and held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him ; but she could not ,
AMPC	Mark	6	20	For Herod had [ [ k ] a reverential ] fear of John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and [ continually ] kept him safe [ [ l ] under guard ] . When he heard [ John speak ] , he was much perplexed ; and [ yet ] he heard him gladly .
AMPC	Mark	6	21	But an opportune time came [ for Herodias ] when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and the high military commanders and chief men of Galilee .
AMPC	Mark	6	22	For when the daughter [ m ] of Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased and [ n ] fascinated Herod and his guests ; and the king said to the girl , Ask me for whatever you desire , and I will give it to you .
AMPC	Mark	6	23	And he put himself under oath to her , Whatever you ask me , I will give it to you , even to the half of my kingdom . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	6	24	Then she left the room and said to her mother , What shall I ask for [ myself ] ? And she replied , The head of John the Baptist !
AMPC	Mark	6	25	And she rushed back instantly to the king and requested , saying , I wish you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter .
AMPC	Mark	6	26	And the king was deeply pained and grieved and exceedingly sorry , but because of his oaths and his guests , he did not want to slight her [ by breaking faith with her ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king sent off one [ of the soldiers ] of his bodyguard and gave him orders to bring [ John ’ s ] head . He went and beheaded him in the prison
AMPC	Mark	6	28	And brought his head on a platter and handed it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
AMPC	Mark	6	29	When his disciples learned of it , they came and took [ John ’ s ] body and laid it in a tomb .
AMPC	Mark	6	30	The apostles [ sent out as missionaries ] came back and gathered together to Jesus , and told Him all that they had done and taught .
AMPC	Mark	6	31	And He said to them , [ [ o ] As for you ] come away by yourselves to a deserted place , and rest a while—for many were [ continually ] coming and going , and they had not even leisure enough to eat .
AMPC	Mark	6	32	And they went away in a boat to a solitary place by themselves .
AMPC	Mark	6	33	Now many [ people ] saw them going and recognized them , and they ran there on foot from all the surrounding towns , and they got there ahead [ of those in the boat ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	34	As Jesus landed , He saw a great crowd waiting , and He was moved with compassion for them , because they were like sheep without a shepherd ; and He began to teach them many things .
AMPC	Mark	6	35	And when [ p ] the day was already far gone , His disciples came to Him and said , This is a desolate and isolated place , and the hour is now late .
AMPC	Mark	6	36	Send the crowds away to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat .
AMPC	Mark	6	37	But He replied to them , Give them something to eat yourselves . And they said to Him , Shall we go and buy
AMPC	Mark	6	200	[ q ] denarii [ about forty dollars ] worth of bread and give it to them to eat ? ( B )
AMPC	Mark	6	38	And He said to them , How many loaves do you have ? Go and see . And when they [ had looked and ] knew , they said , Five [ loaves ] and two fish .
AMPC	Mark	6	39	Then He commanded the people all to recline on the green grass by companies .
AMPC	Mark	6	40	So they threw themselves down in ranks of hundreds and fifties [ with the [ r ] regularity of an arrangement of beds of herbs , looking [ s ] like so many garden plots ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	41	And taking the five loaves and two fish , He looked up to heaven and , praising God , gave thanks and broke the loaves and kept on giving them to the disciples to set before the people ; and He [ also ] divided the two fish among [ them ] all .
AMPC	Mark	6	42	And they all ate and were satisfied .
AMPC	Mark	6	43	And they took up twelve [ [ t ] small hand ] baskets full of broken pieces [ from the loaves ] and of the fish .
AMPC	Mark	6	44	And those who ate the loaves were 5,000 men .
AMPC	Mark	6	45	And at once He insisted that the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side to Bethsaida , while He was sending the throng away .
AMPC	Mark	6	46	And after He had taken leave of them , He went off into the hills to pray .
AMPC	Mark	6	47	Now when evening had come , the boat was out in the middle of the lake , and He was by Himself on the land .
AMPC	Mark	6	48	And having seen that they were troubled and tormented in [ their ] rowing , for the wind was against them , about the fourth watch of the night [ between 3:00-6:00 a.m. ] He came to them , walking [ directly ] on the sea . And He acted as if He meant to pass by them ,
AMPC	Mark	6	49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost , and [ u ] raised a [ deep , throaty ] shriek of terror .
AMPC	Mark	6	50	For they all saw Him and were agitated ( troubled and filled with fear and dread ) . But immediately He talked with them and said , Take heart ! I Am ! Stop being alarmed and afraid . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	6	51	And He went up into the boat with them , and the wind ceased ( [ v ] sank to rest as if exhausted by its own beating ) . And they were astonished exceedingly [ beyond measure ] ,
AMPC	Mark	6	52	For they failed to consider or understand [ the teaching and meaning of the miracle of ] the loaves ; [ in fact ] their hearts had [ w ] grown callous [ had become dull and had [ x ] lost the power of understanding ] .
AMPC	Mark	6	53	And when they had crossed over , they reached the land of Gennesaret and [ y ] came to [ anchor at ] the shore .
AMPC	Mark	6	54	As soon as they got out of the boat , [ the people ] recognized Him ,
AMPC	Mark	6	55	And they ran about the whole countryside , and began to carry around sick people on their sleeping pads or mats to any place where they heard that He was .
AMPC	Mark	6	56	And wherever He came into villages or cities or the country , they would lay the sick in the marketplaces and beg Him that they might touch even the fringe of His outer garment , and as many as touched Him were restored to health .

AMPC	Mark	7	7	In vain ( fruitlessly and without profit ) do they worship Me , ordering and teaching [ to be obeyed ] as doctrines the commandments and precepts of men . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	7	2	For they had seen that some of His disciples ate with [ a ] common hands , that is , unwashed [ with hands defiled and unhallowed , because they had not given them a [ b ] ceremonial washing ] —
AMPC	Mark	7	3	For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless [ merely for ceremonial reasons ] they wash their hands [ diligently [ c ] up to the elbow ] with clenched fist , adhering [ carefully and faithfully ] to the tradition of [ practices and customs handed down to them by ] their forefathers [ to be observed ] .

AMPC	Mark	7	5	And the Pharisees and scribes kept asking [ Jesus ] , Why do Your disciples not order their way of living according to the tradition handed down by the forefathers [ to be observed ] , but eat with hands unwashed and ceremonially not purified ?
AMPC	Mark	7	6	But He said to them , Excellently and truly [ [ e ] so that there will be no room for blame ] did Isaiah prophesy of you , the pretenders and hypocrites , as it stands written : These people [ constantly ] honor Me with their lips , but their hearts hold off and are far distant from Me .
AMPC	Mark	7	8	You disregard and give up and ask to depart from you the commandment of God and cling to the tradition of men [ keeping it carefully and faithfully ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	9	And He said to them , You have a fine way of rejecting [ thus thwarting and nullifying and doing away with ] the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition ( your own human regulations ) !
AMPC	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , Honor ( revere with tenderness of feeling and deference ) your father and your mother , and , He who curses or reviles or speaks evil of or abuses or treats improperly his father or mother , let him surely die . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	7	11	But [ as for you ] you say , A man is exempt if he tells [ his ] father or [ his ] mother , What you would otherwise have gained from me [ everything I have that would have been of use to you ] is Corban , that is , is a gift [ already given as an offering to God ] ,
AMPC	Mark	7	12	Then you no longer are permitting him to do anything for [ his ] father or mother [ but are letting him off from helping them ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	13	Thus you are nullifying and making void and of no effect [ the authority of ] the Word of God through your tradition , which you [ in turn ] hand on . And many things of this kind you are doing .
AMPC	Mark	7	14	And He called the people to [ Him ] again and said to them , Listen to Me , all of you , and understand [ what I say ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	15	There is not [ even ] one thing outside a man which by going into him can pollute and defile him ; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him and make him unhallowed and unclean .
AMPC	Mark	7	16	[ f ] If any man has ears to hear , let him be listening [ and let him [ g ] perceive and comprehend by hearing ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	17	And when He had left the crowd and had gone into the house , His disciples began asking Him about the parable .
AMPC	Mark	7	18	And He said to them , Then are you also unintelligent and dull and without understanding ? Do you not discern and see that whatever goes into a man from the outside can not make him unhallowed or unclean ,
AMPC	Mark	7	19	Since it does not reach and enter his heart but [ only his ] digestive tract , and so passes on [ into the place designed to receive waste ] ? Thus He was making and declaring all foods [ ceremonially ] clean [ that is , [ h ] abolishing the ceremonial distinctions of the Levitical Law ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	20	And He said , What comes out of a man is what makes a man unclean and renders [ him ] unhallowed .
AMPC	Mark	7	21	For from within , [ that is ] out of the hearts of men , come base and wicked thoughts , sexual immorality , stealing , murder , adultery ,
AMPC	Mark	7	22	Coveting ( a greedy desire to have more wealth ) , dangerous and destructive wickedness , deceit ; [ i ] unrestrained ( indecent ) conduct ; an evil eye ( envy ) , slander ( evil speaking , malicious misrepresentation , abusiveness ) , pride ( [ j ] the sin of an uplifted heart against God and man ) , foolishness ( folly , lack of sense , recklessness , thoughtlessness ) .
AMPC	Mark	7	23	All these evil [ purposes and desires ] come from within , and they make the man unclean and render him unhallowed .
AMPC	Mark	7	24	And Jesus arose and went away from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon . And He went into a house and did not want anyone to know [ that He was there ] ; but it was not possible for Him to be hidden [ from public notice ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	25	Instead , at once , a woman whose little daughter had ( was under the control of ) an unclean spirit heard about Him and came and flung herself down at His feet .
AMPC	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a Greek ( Gentile ) , a Syrophoenician by nationality . And she kept begging Him to drive the demon out of her little daughter .
AMPC	Mark	7	27	And He said to her , First let the children be fed , for it is not becoming or proper or right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the [ little house ] dogs .
AMPC	Mark	7	28	But she answered Him , Yes , Lord , yet even the small pups under the table eat the little children ’ s scraps of food .
AMPC	Mark	7	29	And He said to her , Because of this saying , you may go your way ; the demon has gone out of your daughter [ permanently ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	30	And she went home and found the child thrown on the couch , and the demon departed .
AMPC	Mark	7	31	Soon after this , Jesus , coming back from the region of Tyre , passed through Sidon on to the Sea of Galilee , through the region of Decapolis [ the ten cities ] .
AMPC	Mark	7	32	And they brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty in speaking , and they begged Jesus to place His hand upon him .
AMPC	Mark	7	33	And taking him aside from the crowd [ privately ] , He thrust His fingers into the man ’ s ears and spat and touched his tongue ;
AMPC	Mark	7	34	And looking up to heaven , He sighed as He said , Ephphatha , which means , Be opened !
AMPC	Mark	7	35	And his ears were opened , his tongue was loosed , and he began to speak distinctly and as he should .
AMPC	Mark	7	36	And Jesus [ [ k ] in His own interest ] admonished and ordered them sternly and expressly to tell no one ; but the more He commanded them , the more zealously they proclaimed it .
AMPC	Mark	7	37	And they were overwhelmingly astonished , saying , He has done everything excellently ( commendably and nobly ) ! He even makes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak !

AMPC	Mark	8	8	And they ate and were satisfied ; and they took up seven [ [ b ] large provision ] baskets full of the broken pieces left over .
AMPC	Mark	8	2	I have pity and sympathy for the people and My heart goes out to them , for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [ left ] to eat ;
AMPC	Mark	8	3	And if I send them away to their homes hungry , they will be feeble through exhaustion and faint along the road ; and some of them have come a long way .
AMPC	Mark	8	4	And His disciples replied to Him , How can anyone fill and satisfy [ these people ] with loaves of bread here in [ this ] desolate and uninhabited region ?
AMPC	Mark	8	5	And He asked them , How many loaves have you ? They said , Seven .
AMPC	Mark	8	6	And He commanded the multitude to recline upon the ground , and He [ then ] took the seven loaves [ of bread ] and , having given thanks , He broke them and kept on giving them to His disciples to put before [ the people ] , and they placed them before the crowd .
AMPC	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fish ; and when He had [ a ] praised God and given thanks and asked Him to bless them [ to their use ] , He ordered that these also should be set before [ them ] .
AMPC	Mark	8	9	And there were about 4,000 people . And He dismissed them ,
AMPC	Mark	8	10	And at once He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha ( or Magdala ) .
AMPC	Mark	8	11	The Pharisees came and began to argue with and question Him , demanding from Him a sign ( an attesting miracle from heaven ) [ maliciously ] to test Him .
AMPC	Mark	8	12	And He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said , Why does this generation demand a sign ? Positively I say to you , no sign shall be given this generation .
AMPC	Mark	8	13	And He went away and left them and , getting into the boat again , He departed to the other side .
AMPC	Mark	8	14	Now they had [ [ c ] completely ] forgotten to bring bread , and they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
AMPC	Mark	8	15	And Jesus [ repeatedly and expressly ] charged and admonished them , saying , Look out ; keep on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod [ d ] and the Herodians .
AMPC	Mark	8	16	And they discussed it and reasoned with one another , It is because we have no bread .
AMPC	Mark	8	17	And being aware [ of it ] , Jesus said to them , Why are you reasoning and saying it is because you have no bread ? Do you not yet discern or understand ? Are your hearts in [ a settled state of ] hardness ? ( A )
AMPC	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , do you not see [ with them ] , and having ears , do you not hear and perceive and understand the sense of what is said ? And do you not remember ?
AMPC	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000 , how many [ [ e ] small hand ] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? They said to Him , Twelve .
AMPC	Mark	8	20	And [ when I broke ] the seven loaves for the 4,000 , how many [ [ f ] large provision ] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up ? And they said to Him , Seven .
AMPC	Mark	8	21	And He [ g ] kept repeating , Do you not yet understand ?
AMPC	Mark	8	22	And they came to Bethsaida . And [ people ] brought to Him a blind man and begged Him to touch him .
AMPC	Mark	8	23	And He [ h ] caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village ; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him , He asked him , Do you [ [ i ] possibly ] see anything ?
AMPC	Mark	8	24	And he looked up and said , I see people , but [ they look ] like trees , walking .
AMPC	Mark	8	25	Then He put His hands on his eyes again ; and the man looked intently [ that is , fixed his eyes on definite objects ] , and he was restored and saw everything distinctly [ even what was [ j ] at a distance ] .
AMPC	Mark	8	26	And He sent him away to his house , telling [ him ] , Do not [ even ] enter the village [ k ] or tell anyone there .
AMPC	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way He asked His disciples , Who do people say that I am ?
AMPC	Mark	8	28	And they answered [ Him ] , John the Baptist ; and others [ say ] , Elijah ; but others , one of the prophets .
AMPC	Mark	8	29	And He asked them , But who do you yourselves say that I am ? Peter replied to Him , You are the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Mark	8	30	And He charged them sharply to tell no one about Him .
AMPC	Mark	8	31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must of necessity suffer many things and be tested and disapproved and rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes , and be put to death , and after three days rise again [ [ l ] from death ] .
AMPC	Mark	8	32	And He said this freely ( frankly , plainly , and explicitly , making it unmistakable ) . And Peter took Him [ m ] by the hand and led Him aside and then [ facing Him ] began to rebuke Him .
AMPC	Mark	8	33	But turning around [ His back to Peter ] and seeing His disciples , He rebuked Peter , saying , Get behind Me , Satan ! For you do not have a mind [ n ] intent on promoting what God wills , but what pleases men [ you are not on God ’ s side , but that of men ] .
AMPC	Mark	8	34	And Jesus called [ to Him ] the throng with His disciples and said to them , If anyone intends to come after Me , let him deny himself [ forget , ignore , disown , and [ o ] lose sight of himself and his own interests ] and take up his cross , and [ [ p ] joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party ] follow [ q ] with Me [ continually , cleaving steadfastly to Me ] .
AMPC	Mark	8	35	For whoever wants to save his [ [ r ] higher , spiritual , eternal ] life , will lose it [ the [ s ] lower , natural , temporal life [ t ] which is lived only on earth ] ; and whoever gives up his life [ which is lived only on earth ] for My sake and the Gospel ’ s will save it [ his [ u ] higher , spiritual life [ v ] in the eternal kingdom of God ] .
AMPC	Mark	8	36	For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life [ [ w ] in the eternal kingdom of God ] ?
AMPC	Mark	8	37	For what can a man give as an exchange ( [ x ] a compensation , a ransom , in return ) for his [ blessed ] life [ [ y ] in the eternal kingdom of God ] ?
AMPC	Mark	8	38	For whoever [ z ] is ashamed [ here and now ] of Me and My words in this adulterous ( unfaithful ) and [ preeminently ] sinful generation , of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory ( splendor and majesty ) of His Father with the holy angels .

AMPC	Mark	9	9	And as they were coming back down the mountain , He admonished and [ f ] expressly ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man should rise from among the dead .
AMPC	Mark	9	2	Six days after this , Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves . And He was transfigured before them and became resplendent with divine brightness .
AMPC	Mark	9	3	And His garments became glistening , intensely white , as no fuller ( cloth dresser , launderer ) on earth could bleach them .
AMPC	Mark	9	4	And Elijah appeared [ there ] to them , accompanied by Moses , and they were [ a ] holding [ a protracted ] conversation with Jesus .
AMPC	Mark	9	5	And [ b ] Peter took up the conversation , saying , Master , it is good and suitable and beautiful for us to be here . Let us make three booths ( tents ) —one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah .
AMPC	Mark	9	6	For he did not [ really ] know what to say , for they were in a violent fright ( [ c ] aghast with dread ) .
AMPC	Mark	9	7	And a cloud threw a shadow upon them , and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is My Son , the [ [ d ] most dearworthy ] Beloved One . Be [ e ] constantly listening to and obeying Him !
AMPC	Mark	9	8	And looking around , they suddenly no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus only .
AMPC	Mark	9	10	So they carefully and faithfully kept the matter to themselves , questioning and disputing with one another about what rising from among the dead meant .
AMPC	Mark	9	11	And they asked Him , Why do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first ? ( A )
AMPC	Mark	9	12	And He said to them , Elijah , it is true , does come first to restore all things and [ g ] set them to rights . And how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be utterly despised and be treated with contempt and rejected ? ( B )
AMPC	Mark	9	13	But I tell you that Elijah has already come , and [ people ] did to him whatever they desired , as it is written of him .
AMPC	Mark	9	14	And when they came to the [ nine ] disciples , they saw a great crowd around them and scribes questioning and disputing with them .
AMPC	Mark	9	15	And immediately all the crowd , when they saw Jesus [ [ h ] returning from the holy mount , His face and person yet glistening ] , they were greatly amazed and ran up to Him [ and ] greeted Him .
AMPC	Mark	9	16	And He asked them , About what are you questioning and discussing with them ?
AMPC	Mark	9	17	And one of the throng replied to Him , Teacher , I brought my son to You , for he has a dumb spirit .
AMPC	Mark	9	18	And wherever it lays hold of him [ so as to make him its own ] , it dashes him down and convulses him , and he foams [ at the mouth ] and grinds his teeth , and he [ [ i ] falls into a motionless stupor and ] is wasting away . And I asked Your disciples to drive it out , and they were not able [ to do it ] .
AMPC	Mark	9	19	And He answered them , O unbelieving generation [ without any faith ] ! How long [ j ] shall I [ have to do ] with you ? How long am I to bear with you ? Bring him to Me .
AMPC	Mark	9	20	So they brought [ the boy ] to Him , and when the spirit saw Him , at once it completely convulsed the boy , and he fell to the ground and kept rolling about , foaming [ at the mouth ] .
AMPC	Mark	9	21	And [ Jesus ] asked his father , How long has he had this ? And he answered , From the time he was a little boy .
AMPC	Mark	9	22	And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water , intending to kill him . But if You can do anything , do have pity on us and help us .
AMPC	Mark	9	23	And Jesus said , [ You say to Me ] , If You can do anything ? [ Why , ] all things can be ( are possible ) to him who believes !
AMPC	Mark	9	24	At once the father of the boy gave [ an [ k ] eager , [ l ] piercing , inarticulate ] cry with tears , and he said , Lord , I believe ! [ Constantly ] help my [ m ] weakness of faith !
AMPC	Mark	9	25	But when Jesus noticed that a crowd [ of people ] came running together , He rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , You dumb and deaf spirit , I charge you to come out of him and never go into him again .
AMPC	Mark	9	26	And after giving a [ hoarse , clamoring , fear-stricken ] shriek of anguish and convulsing him terribly , it came out ; and the boy lay [ pale and motionless ] like a corpse , so that many of them said , He is dead .
AMPC	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took [ [ n ] a strong grip of ] his hand and began lifting him up , and he stood .
AMPC	Mark	9	28	And when He had gone indoors , His disciples asked Him privately , Why could not we drive it out ?
AMPC	Mark	9	29	And He replied to them , This kind can not be driven out by anything but prayer [ o ] and fasting .
AMPC	Mark	9	30	They went on from there and passed along through Galilee . And He did not wish to have anyone know it ,
AMPC	Mark	9	31	For He was [ engaged for the time being in ] teaching His disciples . He said to them , The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men , and they will put Him to death ; and when He has been killed , after three days He will rise [ [ p ] from death ] .
AMPC	Mark	9	32	But they did not comprehend what He was saying , and they were afraid to ask Him [ what this statement meant ] .
AMPC	Mark	9	33	And they arrived at Capernaum ; and when [ they were ] in the house , He asked them , What were you discussing and arguing about on the road ?
AMPC	Mark	9	34	But they kept still , for on the road they had discussed and disputed with one another as to who was the greatest .
AMPC	Mark	9	35	And He sat down and called the Twelve [ apostles ] , and He said to them , If anyone desires to be first , he must be last of all , and servant of all .
AMPC	Mark	9	36	And He took a little child and put him in the center of their group ; and taking him in [ His ] arms , He said to them ,
AMPC	Mark	9	37	Whoever in My name and for My sake accepts and receives and welcomes one such child also accepts and receives and welcomes Me ; and whoever so receives Me receives not only Me but Him Who sent Me .
AMPC	Mark	9	38	John said to Him , Teacher , we saw a man who does not follow along with us driving out demons in Your name , and we forbade him to do it , because he [ q ] is not one of our band [ of Your disciples ] .
AMPC	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , Do not restrain or hinder or forbid him ; for no one who does a mighty work in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me .
AMPC	Mark	9	40	For he who is not against us is for us . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	9	41	For I tell you truly , whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to and bear the name of Christ will by no means fail to get his reward .
AMPC	Mark	9	42	And whoever causes one of these little ones ( these believers ) who [ r ] acknowledge and cleave to Me to stumble and sin , it would be better ( more profitable and wholesome ) for him if a [ huge ] millstone were hung about his neck , and he were thrown into the sea .
AMPC	Mark	9	43	And if your hand puts a stumbling block before you and causes you to sin , cut it off ! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to go into life [ [ s ] that is really worthwhile ] maimed than with two hands to go to hell ( Gehenna ) , into the fire that can not be put out . [ t ]
AMPC	Mark	9	45	And if your foot is a cause of stumbling and sin to you , cut it off ! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter into life [ that is really worthwhile ] crippled than , having two feet , to be cast into hell ( Gehenna ) [ u ] .
AMPC	Mark	9	47	And if your eye causes you to stumble and sin , pluck it out ! It is more profitable and wholesome for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell ( Gehenna ) ,

AMPC	Mark	10	8	And the two shall become one flesh , so that they are no longer two , but one flesh . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	10	9	What therefore God has united ( joined together ) , let not man separate or divide .
AMPC	Mark	10	11	And He said to them , Whoever [ f ] dismisses ( repudiates and divorces ) his wife and marries another commits adultery against her ;
AMPC	Mark	10	12	And if a woman dismisses ( repudiates and divorces ) her husband and marries another , she commits adultery .
AMPC	Mark	10	13	And they kept bringing young children to Him that He might touch them , and the disciples were reproving them [ for it ] .
AMPC	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw [ it ] , He was indignant and [ g ] pained and said to them , Allow the children to come to Me—do not forbid or prevent or hinder them—for to such belongs the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Mark	10	15	Truly I tell you , whoever does not receive and accept and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [ does ] positively shall not enter it at all .

AMPC	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said to him , Why do you call Me [ [ m ] essentially and perfectly [ n ] morally ] good ? There is no one [ [ o ] essentially and perfectly [ p ] morally ] good—except God alone .
AMPC	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : Do not kill , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not bear false witness , do not defraud , honor your father and mother . ( D )

AMPC	Mark	10	21	And Jesus , looking upon him , loved him , and He said to him , You lack one thing ; go and sell all you have and give [ the money ] to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come [ and ] accompany Me [ [ q ] walking the same road that I walk ] .
AMPC	Mark	10	22	At that saying the man ’ s countenance fell and was gloomy , and he went away grieved and sorrowing , for he was holding great possessions .
AMPC	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples , With what difficulty will those who possess wealth and [ r ] keep on holding it enter the kingdom of God !
AMPC	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were amazed and bewildered and perplexed at His words . But Jesus said to them again , Children , how hard it is [ s ] for those who trust ( place their confidence , their sense of safety ) in riches to enter the kingdom of God !
AMPC	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Mark	10	26	And they were shocked and exceedingly astonished , and said to Him and [ t ] to one another , Then who can be saved ?
AMPC	Mark	10	27	Jesus glanced around at them and said , With men [ it is ] impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God .
AMPC	Mark	10	28	Peter started to say to Him , Behold , we have [ u ] yielded up and abandoned everything [ once and for all and [ v ] joined You as Your disciples , siding with Your party ] and accompanied You [ [ w ] walking the same road that You walk ] .
AMPC	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , Truly I tell you , there is no one who has given up and left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for My sake and for the Gospel ’ s
AMPC	Mark	10	30	Who will not receive a hundred times as much now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions—and in the age to come , eternal life .
AMPC	Mark	10	31	But many [ who are now ] first will be last [ then ] , and many [ who are now ] last will be first [ then ] .
AMPC	Mark	10	32	They were on the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking on in front of them ; and they were bewildered and perplexed and greatly astonished , and those [ who were still ] following were seized with alarm and were afraid . And He took the Twelve [ apostles ] again and began to tell them what was about to happen to Him ,
AMPC	Mark	10	33	[ Saying ] , Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will condemn and sentence Him to death and turn Him over to the Gentiles .
AMPC	Mark	10	34	And they will mock Him and spit on Him , and whip Him and put Him to death ; but after three days He will rise again [ [ x ] from death ] .
AMPC	Mark	10	35	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , approached Him and said to Him , Teacher , we desire You to do for us whatever we ask of You .
AMPC	Mark	10	36	And He replied to them , What do you desire Me to do for you ?
AMPC	Mark	10	37	And they said to Him , Grant that we may sit , one at Your right hand and one at [ Your ] left hand , in Your glory ( Your majesty and splendor ) .
AMPC	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them , You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism [ of affliction ] with which I am baptized ?
AMPC	Mark	10	39	And they replied to Him , We are able . And Jesus told them , The cup that I drink you will drink , and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ,
AMPC	Mark	10	40	But to sit at My right hand or at My left hand is not Mine to give ; but [ it will be given to those ] for whom it is ordained and prepared .
AMPC	Mark	10	41	And when the other ten [ apostles ] heard it , they began to be indignant with James and John .
AMPC	Mark	10	42	But Jesus called them to [ Him ] and said to them , You know that those who are recognized as governing and are supposed to rule the Gentiles ( the nations ) lord it over them [ ruling with absolute power , holding them in subjection ] , and their great men exercise authority and dominion over them .
AMPC	Mark	10	43	But this is not to be so among you ; instead , whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant ,
AMPC	Mark	10	44	And whoever wishes to be most important and first in rank among you must be slave of all .
AMPC	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man came not to have service rendered to Him , but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for ( [ y ] instead of ) many .
AMPC	Mark	10	46	Then they came to Jericho . And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a great crowd , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , a son of Timaeus , was sitting by the roadside .
AMPC	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout , saying , Jesus , Son of David , have pity and mercy on me [ [ z ] now ] !
AMPC	Mark	10	48	And many [ aa ] severely censured and reproved him , telling him to keep still , but he kept on shouting out all the more , You Son of David , have pity and mercy on me [ now ] !
AMPC	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stopped and said , Call him . And they called the blind man , telling him , Take courage ! Get up ! He is calling you .
AMPC	Mark	10	50	And throwing off his outer garment , he leaped up and came to Jesus .
AMPC	Mark	10	51	And Jesus said to him , What do you want Me to do for you ? And the blind man said to Him , Master , let me receive my sight .
AMPC	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him , Go your way ; your faith has healed you . And at once he received his sight and accompanied Jesus on the road .

AMPC	Mark	11	11	And Jesus went into Jerusalem and entered the temple [ [ b ] enclosure ] ; and when He had looked around , surveying and observing everything , as it was already late , He went out to Bethany together with the Twelve [ apostles ] .
AMPC	Mark	11	2	And instructed them , Go into the village in front of you , and as soon as you enter it , you will find a colt tied , which has never been ridden by anyone ; unfasten it and bring it [ here ] .
AMPC	Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you , Why are you doing this ? answer , The Lord needs it , and He will send it back here presently .
AMPC	Mark	11	4	So they went away and found a colt tied at the door out in the [ winding ] open street , and they loosed it .
AMPC	Mark	11	5	And some who were standing there said to them , What are you doing , untying the colt ?
AMPC	Mark	11	6	And they replied as Jesus had directed them , and they allowed them to go .
AMPC	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their outer garments upon it , and He sat on it .
AMPC	Mark	11	8	And many [ of the people ] spread their garments on the road , and others [ scattered a layer of ] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields .
AMPC	Mark	11	9	And those who went before and those who followed cried out [ [ a ] with a cry of happiness ] , Hosanna ! [ Be graciously inclined and propitious to Him ! ] Praised and blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord ! ( A )
AMPC	Mark	11	10	Praised and blessed in the name of the Lord is the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hosanna ( O save us ) in the highest [ heaven ] !
AMPC	Mark	11	12	On the day following , when they had come away from Bethany , He was hungry .
AMPC	Mark	11	13	And seeing in the distance a fig tree [ covered ] with leaves , He went to see if He could find any [ fruit ] on it [ [ c ] for in the fig tree the fruit appears at the same time as the leaves ] . But when He came up to it , He found nothing but leaves , for the fig season had not yet come .
AMPC	Mark	11	14	And He said to it , No one ever again shall eat fruit from you . And His disciples were listening [ to what He said ] .
AMPC	Mark	11	15	And they came to Jerusalem . And He went into the temple [ area , the [ d ] porches and courts ] and began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple area , and He overturned the [ [ e ] four-footed ] tables of the money changers and the seats of those who dealt in doves ;
AMPC	Mark	11	16	And He would not permit anyone to carry any household equipment through the temple enclosure [ thus making the temple area a short-cut traffic lane ] .
AMPC	Mark	11	17	And He taught and said to them , Is it not written , My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? But you have turned it into a den of robbers . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	11	18	And the chief priests and the scribes heard [ of this ] and kept seeking some way to destroy Him , for they feared Him , because the entire multitude was struck with astonishment at His teaching .
AMPC	Mark	11	19	And when evening came on , He and [ f ] His disciples , as accustomed , went out of the city .
AMPC	Mark	11	20	In the morning , when they were passing along , they noticed that the fig tree was withered [ completely ] away to its roots .
AMPC	Mark	11	21	And Peter remembered and said to Him , Master , look ! The fig tree which You doomed has withered away !
AMPC	Mark	11	22	And Jesus , replying , said to them , Have faith in God [ constantly ] .
AMPC	Mark	11	23	Truly I tell you , whoever says to this mountain , Be lifted up and thrown into the sea ! and does not doubt at all in his heart but believes that what he says will take place , it will be done for him .
AMPC	Mark	11	24	For this reason I am telling you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe ( trust and be confident ) that it is granted to you , and you will [ get it ] .
AMPC	Mark	11	25	And whenever you stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him and [ g ] let it drop ( leave it , let it go ) , in order that your Father Who is in heaven may also forgive you your [ own ] failings and shortcomings and let them drop .

AMPC	Mark	11	27	And they came again to Jerusalem . And when Jesus was walking about in the [ [ i ] courts and porches of the ] temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him ,
AMPC	Mark	11	28	And they kept saying to Him , By what [ sort of ] authority are You doing these things , or who gave You this authority to do them ?
AMPC	Mark	11	29	Jesus told them , I will ask you a question . Answer Me , and then I will tell you by what [ sort of ] authority I do these things .
AMPC	Mark	11	30	Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men ? Answer Me .
AMPC	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned and argued with one another , If we say , From heaven , He will say , Why then did you not believe him ?
AMPC	Mark	11	32	But [ on the other hand ] can we say , From men ? For they were afraid of the people , because everybody considered and held John actually to be a prophet .
AMPC	Mark	11	33	So they replied to Jesus , We do not know . And Jesus said to them , Neither am I going to tell you what [ sort of ] authority I have for doing these things .

AMPC	Mark	12	12	And they were trying to get hold of Him , but they were afraid of the people , for they knew that He spoke this parable with reference to and against them . So they left Him and departed . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	12	2	When the season came , he sent a bond servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
AMPC	Mark	12	3	But they took him and beat him and sent him away without anything .
AMPC	Mark	12	4	Again he sent to them another bond servant , and they stoned him and wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully [ sending him away with insults ] .
AMPC	Mark	12	5	And he sent another , and that one they killed ; then many others—some they beat , and some they put to death .
AMPC	Mark	12	6	He had still one left [ to send ] , a beloved son ; last of all he sent him to them , saying , They will respect my son .
AMPC	Mark	12	7	But those tenants said to one another , Here is the heir ; come on , let us put him to death , and [ then ] the inheritance will be ours .
AMPC	Mark	12	8	And they took him and killed him , and threw [ his body ] outside the vineyard .
AMPC	Mark	12	9	Now what will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the tenants , and give the vineyard to others .
AMPC	Mark	12	10	Have you not even read this [ passage of ] Scripture : The very Stone which [ [ a ] after putting It to the test ] the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner [ Cornerstone ] ;
AMPC	Mark	12	11	This is from the Lord and is His doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ? ( A )
AMPC	Mark	12	13	But they sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to Him for the purpose of entrapping Him in His speech .
AMPC	Mark	12	14	And they came up and said to Him , Teacher , we know that You are [ b ] sincere and what You profess to be , that You can not lie , and that You have no personal bias for anyone ; for You are not influenced by partiality and have no [ c ] regard for anyone ’ s external condition or position , but in [ and on the basis of ] truth You teach the way of God . Is it lawful ( permissible and right ) to give tribute ( [ d ] poll taxes ) to Caesar or not ?
AMPC	Mark	12	15	Should we pay [ them ] or should we not pay [ them ] ? But knowing their hypocrisy , He asked them , Why do you put Me to the test ? Bring Me a coin ( a denarius ) , so I may see it .
AMPC	Mark	12	16	And they brought [ Him one ] . Then He asked them , Whose image ( picture ) is this ? And whose superscription ( [ e ] title ) ? They said to Him , Caesar ’ s .
AMPC	Mark	12	17	Jesus said to them , Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s and to [ f ] God the things that are God ’ s . And they [ g ] stood marveling and greatly amazed at Him .
AMPC	Mark	12	18	And [ some ] Sadducees came to Him , [ of that party ] who say there is no resurrection , and they asked Him a question , saying ,
AMPC	Mark	12	19	Teacher , Moses gave us [ a law ] that if a man ’ s brother died , leaving a wife but no child , the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brothers ; the first one took a wife and died , leaving no children .
AMPC	Mark	12	21	And the second [ brother ] married her , and died , leaving no children ; and the third did the same ;
AMPC	Mark	12	22	And all seven , leaving no children . Last of all , the woman died also .
AMPC	Mark	12	23	Now in the resurrection , whose wife will she be ? For the seven were married to her .
AMPC	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , Is not this where you wander out of the way and go wrong , because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God ?
AMPC	Mark	12	25	For when they arise from among the dead , [ men ] do not marry nor are [ women ] given in marriage , but are like the angels in heaven .
AMPC	Mark	12	26	But concerning the dead being raised—have you not read in the book of Moses , [ in the passage ] about the [ burning ] bush , how God said to him , I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ? ( D )
AMPC	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of [ the ] dead , but of [ the ] living ! You are very wrong .
AMPC	Mark	12	28	Then one of the scribes came up and listened to them disputing with one another , and , noticing that Jesus answered them fitly and admirably , he asked Him , Which commandment is first and most important of all [ [ h ] in its nature ] ?
AMPC	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , The first and principal one of all commands is : Hear , O Israel , The Lord our God is one Lord ;

AMPC	Mark	12	31	The second is like it and is this , You shall love your neighbor as yourself . There is no other commandment greater than these . ( F )
AMPC	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to Him , Excellently and fitly and admirably answered , Teacher ! You have said truly that He is One , and there is no other but Him ;
AMPC	Mark	12	33	And to love Him out of and with all the heart and with all the understanding [ with the [ m ] faculty of quick apprehension and intelligence and keenness of discernment ] and with all the strength , and to love one ’ s neighbor as oneself , is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . ( G )
AMPC	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently ( discreetly and [ n ] having his wits about him ) , He said to him , You are not far from the kingdom of God . And after that no one ventured or dared to ask Him any further question .
AMPC	Mark	12	35	And as Jesus taught in [ a [ o ] porch or court of ] the temple , He said , How can the scribes say that the Christ is David ’ s Son ?
AMPC	Mark	12	36	David himself , [ inspired ] in the Holy Spirit , declared , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies [ a footstool ] under Your feet . ( H )
AMPC	Mark	12	37	David himself calls Him Lord ; so how can it be that He is his Son ? Now the great mass of the people heard [ Jesus ] gladly [ listening to Him with delight ] .
AMPC	Mark	12	38	And in [ the course of ] His teaching , He said , Beware of the scribes , who like to go around in long robes and [ to get ] greetings in the marketplaces [ public forums ] ,
AMPC	Mark	12	39	And [ have ] the front seats in the synagogues and the [ p ] chief couches ( places of honor ) at feasts ,
AMPC	Mark	12	40	Who devour widows ’ houses and to cover it up make long prayers . They will receive the heavier [ sentence of ] condemnation .
AMPC	Mark	12	41	And He sat down opposite the treasury and saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury . Many rich [ people ] were throwing in large sums .
AMPC	Mark	12	42	And a widow who was poverty-stricken came and put in two copper mites [ the smallest of coins ] , which together make [ q ] half of a cent .
AMPC	Mark	12	43	And He called His disciples [ to Him ] and said to them , Truly and surely I tell you , this widow , [ she who is ] poverty-stricken , has put in more than all those contributing to the treasury .
AMPC	Mark	12	44	For they all threw in out of their abundance ; but she , out of her deep poverty , has put in everything that she had— [ even ] all she had on which to live .

AMPC	Mark	13	13	And you will be hated and detested by everybody for My name ’ s sake , but he who patiently perseveres and endures to the end will be saved ( [ i ] made a partaker of the salvation by Christ , and delivered [ j ] from spiritual death ) .
AMPC	Mark	13	2	And Jesus replied to him , You see these great buildings ? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be loosened and torn down .
AMPC	Mark	13	3	And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple [ [ b ] enclosure ] , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately ,
AMPC	Mark	13	4	Tell us when is this to take place and what will be the sign when these things , all [ of them ] , are about to be accomplished ?
AMPC	Mark	13	5	And Jesus began to tell them , Be careful and watchful that no one misleads you [ about it ] .
AMPC	Mark	13	6	Many will come in [ [ c ] appropriating to themselves ] the name [ of Messiah ] which belongs to Me [ [ d ] basing their claims on the use of My name ] , saying , I am [ He ] ! And they will mislead many .
AMPC	Mark	13	7	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not get alarmed ( troubled and frightened ) ; it is necessary [ that these things ] take place , but the end is not yet .
AMPC	Mark	13	8	For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places ; there will be famines and calamities . This is but the beginning of the [ e ] intolerable anguish and suffering [ only the first of the [ f ] birth pangs ] .
AMPC	Mark	13	9	But look to yourselves ; for they will turn you over to councils , and you will be beaten in the synagogues , and you will stand before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them .
AMPC	Mark	13	10	And the good news ( the Gospel ) must first be preached to all nations .
AMPC	Mark	13	11	Now when they take you [ to court ] and put you under arrest , do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say [ g ] nor [ even ] meditate about it ; but say whatever is given you in that hour and at [ h ] the moment , for it is not you who will be speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Mark	13	12	And brother will hand over brother to death , and the father his child ; and children will take a stand against their parents and [ have ] them put to death .
AMPC	Mark	13	14	But when you see the abomination of desolation mentioned by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not to be— [ and ] let the one who reads take notice and consider and understand and heed [ this ] —then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	13	15	Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house nor go inside to take anything out of his house ;
AMPC	Mark	13	16	And let him who is in the field not turn back again to get his mantle ( cloak ) .
AMPC	Mark	13	17	And alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have nursing babies in those days !
AMPC	Mark	13	18	Pray that it may not occur in winter ,
AMPC	Mark	13	19	For at that time there will be such affliction ( oppression and tribulation ) as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until this particular time—and [ k ] positively never will be [ again ] .
AMPC	Mark	13	20	And unless the Lord had shortened the days , no human being would be saved ( rescued ) ; but for the sake of the elect , His chosen ones ( those whom He [ l ] picked out for Himself ) , He has shortened the days . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	13	21	And then if anyone says to you , See , here is the Christ ( the Messiah ) ! or , Look , there He is ! do not believe it .
AMPC	Mark	13	22	False Christs ( Messiahs ) and false prophets will arise and show signs and [ work ] miracles to deceive and lead astray , if possible , even the elect ( those God has chosen out for Himself ) .
AMPC	Mark	13	23	But look to yourselves and be on your guard ; I have told you everything beforehand .
AMPC	Mark	13	24	But in those days , after [ the affliction and oppression and distress of ] that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ; ( C )
AMPC	Mark	13	25	And the stars will be falling from the sky , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken . ( D )
AMPC	Mark	13	26	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great ( kingly ) power and glory ( majesty and splendor ) . ( E )
AMPC	Mark	13	27	And then He will send out the angels and will gather together His elect ( those He has [ m ] picked out for Himself ) from the four winds , from the farthest bounds of the earth to the farthest bounds of heaven .
AMPC	Mark	13	28	Now learn a lesson from the fig tree : as soon as its branch becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves , you recognize and know that summer is near .
AMPC	Mark	13	29	So also , when you see these things happening , you may recognize and know that He is near , at [ the very ] door .
AMPC	Mark	13	30	Surely I say to you , this generation ( [ n ] the whole multitude of people living at that one time ) positively will not perish or pass away before all these things take place .
AMPC	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth will perish and pass away , but My words will not perish or pass away .
AMPC	Mark	13	32	But of that day or that hour not a [ single ] person knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
AMPC	Mark	13	33	Be on your guard [ constantly alert ] , and watch [ o ] and pray ; for you do not know when the time will come .
AMPC	Mark	13	34	It is like a man [ [ p ] already ] going on a journey ; when he leaves home , he puts his servants in charge , each with his particular task , and he gives orders to the doorkeeper to be constantly alert and on the watch .
AMPC	Mark	13	35	Therefore watch ( give strict attention , be cautious and alert ) , for you do not know when the Master of the house is coming—in the evening , or at midnight , or at cockcrowing , or in the morning—
AMPC	Mark	13	36	[ Watch , I say ] lest He come suddenly and unexpectedly and find you asleep .
AMPC	Mark	13	37	And what I say to you I say to everybody : Watch ( give strict attention , be cautious , active , and alert ) !

AMPC	Mark	14	14	And whatever [ house ] he enters , say to the master of the house , The Teacher says : Where is My guest room , where I may eat the Passover [ supper ] with My disciples ?
AMPC	Mark	14	2	For they kept saying , It must not be during the Feast , for fear that there might be a riot of the people .
AMPC	Mark	14	3	And while He was in Bethany , [ a guest ] in the house of Simon the leper , as He was reclining [ at table ] , a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment ( [ a ] perfume ) of pure nard , very costly and precious ; and she broke the jar and poured [ the perfume ] over His head .
AMPC	Mark	14	4	But there were some who were moved with indignation and said to themselves , To what purpose was the ointment ( [ b ] perfume ) thus wasted ?
AMPC	Mark	14	5	For it was possible to have sold this [ perfume ] for more than
AMPC	Mark	14	300	denarii [ a laboring man ’ s wages for a year ] and to have given [ the money ] to the poor . And they censured and reproved her .
AMPC	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why are you troubling her ? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me [ praiseworthy and noble ] .
AMPC	Mark	14	7	For you always have the poor with you , and whenever you wish you can do good to them ; but you will not always have Me . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	14	8	She has done what she could ; she came beforehand to anoint My body for the burial .
AMPC	Mark	14	9	And surely I tell you , wherever the good news ( the Gospel ) is proclaimed in the entire world , what she has done will be told in memory of her .
AMPC	Mark	14	10	Then Judas Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , went off to the chief priests in order to betray and hand Him over to them .
AMPC	Mark	14	11	And when they heard it , they rejoiced and were delighted , and they promised to give him money . And he [ busying himself continually ] sought an opportunity to betray Him .
AMPC	Mark	14	12	On the first day [ of the Feast ] of Unleavened Bread , when [ as was customary ] they killed the Passover lamb , [ Jesus ’ ] disciples said to Him , Where do You wish us to go [ and ] prepare the Passover [ supper ] for You to eat ?
AMPC	Mark	14	13	And He sent two of His disciples and said to them , Go into the city , and a man carrying an [ earthen ] jar or pitcher of water will meet you ; follow him .
AMPC	Mark	14	15	And he will [ himself ] show you a large upper room , furnished [ with carpets and with dining couches properly spread ] and ready ; there prepare for us .
AMPC	Mark	14	16	Then the disciples set out and came to the city and found [ everything ] just as He had told them ; and they prepared the Passover .
AMPC	Mark	14	17	And when it was evening , He came with the Twelve [ apostles ] .
AMPC	Mark	14	18	And while they were at the table eating , Jesus said , Surely I say to you , one of you will betray Me , [ one ] who is eating [ here ] with Me . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	14	19	And they began to show that they were sad and hurt , and to say to Him one after another , Is it I ? or , It is not I , is it ?
AMPC	Mark	14	20	He replied to them , It is one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , one who is dipping [ bread ] into the [ same deep ] dish with Me .
AMPC	Mark	14	21	For the Son of Man is going as it stands written concerning Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been good ( profitable and wholesome ) for that man if he had never been born . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	14	22	And while they were eating , He took a loaf [ of bread ] , praised God and gave thanks and asked Him to bless it to their use . [ Then ] He broke [ it ] and gave to them and said , Take . Eat . This is My body .
AMPC	Mark	14	23	He also took a cup [ of the juice of grapes ] , and when He had given thanks , He gave [ it ] to them , and they all drank of it .
AMPC	Mark	14	24	And He said to them , This is My blood [ which ratifies ] the new covenant , [ the blood ] which is being poured out for ( on account of ) many . ( D )
AMPC	Mark	14	25	Solemnly and surely I tell you , I shall not again drink of the fruit of the vine till that day when I drink it [ c ] of a new and a higher quality in God ’ s kingdom .
AMPC	Mark	14	26	And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
AMPC	Mark	14	27	And Jesus said to them , You will all fall away this night [ that is , you will be caused to stumble and will begin to distrust and desert Me ] , for it stands written , I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered . ( E )
AMPC	Mark	14	28	But after I am raised [ to life ] , I will go before you into Galilee .
AMPC	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to Him , Even if they all fall away and are caused to stumble and distrust and desert You , yet I will not [ do so ] !
AMPC	Mark	14	30	And Jesus said to him , Truly I tell you , this very night , before a cock crows twice , you will utterly deny Me [ disclaiming all connection with Me ] three times .
AMPC	Mark	14	31	But [ Peter ] said more vehemently and repeatedly , [ Even ] if it should be necessary for me to die with You , I will not deny or disown You ! And they all kept saying the same thing .
AMPC	Mark	14	32	Then they went to a place called Gethsemane , and He said to His disciples , Sit down here while I pray .
AMPC	Mark	14	33	And He took with Him Peter and James and John , and began to be [ d ] struck with terror and amazement and deeply troubled and depressed .
AMPC	Mark	14	34	And He said to them , My soul is exceedingly sad ( overwhelmed with grief ) so that it almost kills Me ! Remain here and keep awake and be watching .
AMPC	Mark	14	35	And going a little farther , He fell on the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the [ [ e ] fatal ] hour might pass from Him .
AMPC	Mark	14	36	And He was saying , Abba , [ which means ] Father , everything is possible for You . Take away this cup from Me ; yet not what I will , but what You [ will ] .
AMPC	Mark	14	37	And He came back and found them sleeping , and He said to Peter , Simon , are you asleep ? Have you not the strength to keep awake and watch [ with Me for ] one hour ?
AMPC	Mark	14	38	Keep awake and watch and pray [ constantly ] , that you may not enter into temptation ; the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
AMPC	Mark	14	39	He went away again and prayed , saying the same words .
AMPC	Mark	14	40	And again He came back and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they did not know what answer to give Him .
AMPC	Mark	14	41	And He came back a third time and said to them , Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough [ of that ] ! The hour has come . The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinful men ( men [ f ] whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God ) .
AMPC	Mark	14	42	Get up , let us be going ! See , My betrayer is at hand !
AMPC	Mark	14	43	And at once , while He was still speaking , Judas came , one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs , [ who came ] from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders [ of the Sanhedrin ] .
AMPC	Mark	14	44	Now the betrayer had given them a signal , saying , The One I shall kiss is [ the Man ] ; seize Him and lead [ Him ] away safely [ so as to prevent His escape ] .
AMPC	Mark	14	45	And when he came , he went up to Jesus immediately and said , Master ! Master ! and he [ g ] embraced Him and kissed Him fervently .
AMPC	Mark	14	46	And they threw their hands on Him and arrested Him .
AMPC	Mark	14	47	But one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear .
AMPC	Mark	14	48	And Jesus said to them , Have you come out with swords and clubs as [ you would ] against a robber to capture Me ?
AMPC	Mark	14	49	I was with you daily in the temple [ [ h ] porches and courts ] teaching , and you did not seize Me ; but [ this has happened ] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled .
AMPC	Mark	14	50	Then [ His disciples ] , forsaking Him , fled , all [ of them ] .
AMPC	Mark	14	51	And a young man was following Him , with nothing but a linen cloth ( [ i ] sheet ) thrown about [ his ] naked [ body ] ; and they laid hold of him ,
AMPC	Mark	14	52	But , leaving behind the linen cloth ( [ j ] sheet ) , he fled from them naked .
AMPC	Mark	14	53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest , and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were gathered together .
AMPC	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed Him at a distance , even right into the courtyard of the high priest . And he was sitting [ [ k ] in the firelight ] with the guards and warming himself at the fire .
AMPC	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the entire council ( the Sanhedrin ) were constantly seeking [ to get ] testimony against Jesus with a view to condemning Him and putting Him to death , but they did not find any .
AMPC	Mark	14	56	For many were repeatedly bearing false witness against Him , but their testimonies did not agree .
AMPC	Mark	14	57	And some stood up and were bearing false witness against Him , saying ,
AMPC	Mark	14	58	We heard Him say , I will destroy this temple ( sanctuary ) which is made with hands , and in three days I will build another , made without hands .
AMPC	Mark	14	59	Still not even [ in this ] did their testimony agree .
AMPC	Mark	14	60	And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus , Have You not even one answer to make ? What [ about this which ] these [ men ] are testifying against You ?
AMPC	Mark	14	61	But He kept still and did not answer at all . Again the high priest asked Him , Are You the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) , the Son of the Blessed ?
AMPC	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , I Am ; and you will [ all ] see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power ( [ l ] the Almighty ) and coming on the clouds of heaven . ( F )
AMPC	Mark	14	63	Then the high priest tore his garments and said , What need have we for more witnesses ? ( G )
AMPC	Mark	14	64	You have heard His blasphemy . What is your decision ? And they all condemned Him as being guilty and deserving of death . ( H )
AMPC	Mark	14	65	And some of them began to spit on Him and to blindfold Him and to strike Him with their fists , saying to Him , Prophesy ! And the guards received Him with blows and by slapping Him .
AMPC	Mark	14	66	While Peter was down below in the courtyard , one of the [ serving ] maids of the high priest came ;
AMPC	Mark	14	67	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she gazed intently at him and said , You were with Jesus of Nazareth too .
AMPC	Mark	14	68	But he denied it [ m ] falsely and disowned Him , saying , I neither know nor understand what you say . Then he went outside [ the courtyard and was ] into the [ n ] vestibule . [ o ] And a cock crowed .
AMPC	Mark	14	69	And the maidservant saw him , and began again to say to the bystanders , This [ man ] is [ one ] of them .
AMPC	Mark	14	70	But again he denied it [ p ] falsely and disowned Him . And after a short while , again the bystanders said to Peter , [ q ] Really , you are one of them , for you are a Galilean [ r ] and your dialect shows it .
AMPC	Mark	14	71	Then he commenced invoking a curse on himself [ should he not be telling the truth ] and swearing , I do not know the Man about Whom you are talking !
AMPC	Mark	14	72	And at once for the second time a cock crowed . And Peter remembered how Jesus said to him , Before a cock crows twice , you will [ s ] utterly deny Me [ disclaiming all connection with Me ] three times . And [ t ] having put his thought upon it [ and remembering ] , he broke down and wept aloud and [ u ] lamented .

AMPC	Mark	15	15	So Pilate , wishing to satisfy the crowd , set Barabbas free for them ; and after having Jesus whipped , he handed [ Him ] over to be crucified . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	15	2	And Pilate inquired of Him , Are You the King of the Jews ? And He replied , It is as you say .
AMPC	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests kept accusing Him of many things .
AMPC	Mark	15	4	And Pilate again asked Him , Have [ b ] You no answer to make ? See how many charges they are bringing against You !
AMPC	Mark	15	5	But Jesus made no further answer at all , so that Pilate wondered and marveled . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	15	6	Now at the Feast he [ was accustomed to ] set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested .
AMPC	Mark	15	7	And among the rioters in the prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man named Barabbas .
AMPC	Mark	15	8	And the throng came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them .
AMPC	Mark	15	9	And he replied to them , Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews ?
AMPC	Mark	15	10	For he was aware that it was [ [ c ] because they were prompted ] by envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up .
AMPC	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release for them Barabbas instead .
AMPC	Mark	15	12	And again Pilate said to them , Then what shall I do with the Man Whom you call the King of the Jews ?
AMPC	Mark	15	13	And they shouted back again , Crucify Him !
AMPC	Mark	15	14	But Pilate said to them , Why ? What has He done that is evil ? But they shouted with all their might all the more , Crucify Him [ [ d ] at once ] !
AMPC	Mark	15	16	Then the soldiers led Him away to the courtyard inside the palace , that is , the Praetorium , and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together .
AMPC	Mark	15	17	And they dressed Him in [ a ] purple [ robe ] , and , weaving together a crown of thorns , they placed it on Him .
AMPC	Mark	15	18	And they began to salute Him , Hail ( greetings , good health to You , long life to You ) , King of the Jews !
AMPC	Mark	15	19	And they struck His head with a staff made of a [ bamboo-like ] reed and spat on Him and kept bowing their knees in homage to Him . ( D )
AMPC	Mark	15	20	And when they had [ finished ] making sport of Him , they took the purple [ robe ] off of Him and put His own clothes on Him . And they led Him out [ of the city ] to crucify Him .
AMPC	Mark	15	21	And they forced a passerby , Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus , who was coming in from the field ( country ) , to carry His cross .
AMPC	Mark	15	22	And they led Him to Golgotha [ in Latin : Calvary ] , meaning The Place of a Skull .
AMPC	Mark	15	23	And they [ attempted to ] give Him wine mingled with myrrh , but He would not take it .
AMPC	Mark	15	24	And they crucified Him ; and they divided His garments and distributed them among themselves , throwing lots for them to decide who should take what . ( E )
AMPC	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour ( about nine o ’ clock in the morning ) when they crucified Him . ( F )
AMPC	Mark	15	26	And the inscription of the accusation against Him was written above , The King of the Jews .
AMPC	Mark	15	27	And with Him they crucified two robbers , one on [ His ] right hand and one on His left .
AMPC	Mark	15	28	[ e ] And the Scripture was fulfilled which says , He was counted among the transgressors . ( G )
AMPC	Mark	15	29	And those who passed by kept reviling Him and reproaching Him abusively in harsh and insolent language , wagging their heads and saying , Aha ! You Who would destroy the temple and build it in three days ,
AMPC	Mark	15	30	Now rescue [ f ] Yourself [ [ g ] from death ] , coming down from the cross !
AMPC	Mark	15	31	So also the chief priests , with the scribes , made sport of Him to one another , saying , He rescued others [ [ h ] from death ] ; Himself He is unable to rescue . ( H )
AMPC	Mark	15	32	Let the Christ ( the Messiah ) , the King of Israel , come down now from the cross , that we may see [ it ] and trust in and rely on Him and adhere to Him ! Those who were crucified with Him also reviled and reproached Him [ speaking abusively , harshly , and insolently ] .
AMPC	Mark	15	33	And when the sixth hour ( about midday ) had come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour ( about three o ’ clock ) .
AMPC	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? —which means , My God , My God , why have You forsaken Me [ [ i ] deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned ] ? ( I )
AMPC	Mark	15	35	And some of those standing by , [ and ] hearing it , said , See ! He is calling Elijah !
AMPC	Mark	15	36	And one man ran , and , filling a sponge with vinegar ( a [ j ] mixture of sour wine and water ) , put it on a staff made of a [ bamboo-like ] reed and gave it to Him to drink , saying , Hold off ! Let us see whether Elijah [ does ] come to take Him down . ( J )
AMPC	Mark	15	37	And Jesus uttered a loud cry , and breathed out His life .
AMPC	Mark	15	38	And the curtain [ of the Holy of Holies ] of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom .
AMPC	Mark	15	39	And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way , he said , [ k ] Really , this Man was God ’ s Son !
AMPC	Mark	15	40	Now some women were there also , looking on from a distance , among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses , and Salome ,
AMPC	Mark	15	41	Who , when [ Jesus ] was in Galilee , were in the habit of accompanying and ministering to Him ; and [ there were ] also many other [ women ] who had come up with Him to Jerusalem .
AMPC	Mark	15	42	As evening had already come , since it was the day of Preparation , that is , [ the day ] before the Sabbath , ( K )
AMPC	Mark	15	43	Joseph , he of Arimathea , noble and honorable in rank and a respected member of the council ( Sanhedrin ) , who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God , daring the consequences , took courage and ventured to go to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
AMPC	Mark	15	44	But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon , and , having called the centurion , he asked him whether [ Jesus ] was already dead .
AMPC	Mark	15	45	And when he learned from the centurion [ that He was indeed dead ] , he gave the body to Joseph .
AMPC	Mark	15	46	And Joseph bought a [ fine ] linen cloth [ [ l ] for swathing dead bodies ] , and , taking Him down from the cross , he [ m ] rolled Him up in the [ fine ] linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock . Then he rolled a [ very large ] stone against the door of the tomb . ( L )
AMPC	Mark	15	47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary [ the mother ] of Joses were [ [ n ] attentively ] observing where He was laid .

AMPC	Mark	16	16	He who believes [ who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth ] and is baptized will be saved [ [ f ] from the penalty of eternal death ] ; but he who does not believe [ who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth ] will be condemned .
AMPC	Mark	16	2	And very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb ; [ by then ] the sun had risen .
AMPC	Mark	16	3	And they said to one another , Who will roll back the stone for us out of [ the groove across the floor at ] the door of the tomb ?
AMPC	Mark	16	4	And when they looked up , they [ distinctly ] saw that the stone was already rolled back , for it was very large .
AMPC	Mark	16	5	And going into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting [ there ] on the right [ side ] , clothed in a [ [ a ] long , stately , sweeping ] robe of white , and they were utterly amazed and struck with terror .
AMPC	Mark	16	6	And he said to them , Do not be amazed and terrified ; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth , Who was crucified . He has risen ; He is not here . See the place where they laid Him . ( A )
AMPC	Mark	16	7	But be going ; tell the disciples and Peter , He goes before you into Galilee ; you will see Him there , [ just ] as He told you . ( B )
AMPC	Mark	16	8	Then they went out [ and ] fled from the tomb , for trembling and bewilderment and consternation had seized them . And they said nothing about it to anyone , for they were held by alarm and fear .
AMPC	Mark	16	9	[ b ] Now Jesus , having risen [ [ c ] from death ] early on the first day of the week , appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom He had driven out seven demons .
AMPC	Mark	16	10	She went and reported it to those who had been with Him , as they grieved and wept .
AMPC	Mark	16	11	And when they heard that He was alive and that she had seen Him , they did not believe it .
AMPC	Mark	16	12	After this , He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking [ along the way ] into the country .
AMPC	Mark	16	13	And they returned [ to Jerusalem ] and told the others , but they did not believe them either .
AMPC	Mark	16	14	Afterward He appeared to the Eleven [ apostles themselves ] as they reclined at table ; and He reproved and reproached them for their unbelief ( their lack of faith ) and their hardness of heart , because they had refused to believe those who had seen Him and looked at Him attentively after He had risen [ [ d ] from death ] .
AMPC	Mark	16	15	And He said to them , Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news ( the Gospel ) to every creature [ of the whole [ e ] human race ] .
AMPC	Mark	16	17	And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe : in My name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new languages ;
AMPC	Mark	16	18	They will pick up serpents ; and [ even ] if they drink anything deadly , it will not hurt them ; they will lay their hands on the sick , and they will get well .
AMPC	Mark	16	19	So then the Lord Jesus , after He had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven and He sat down at the right hand of God . ( C )
AMPC	Mark	16	20	And they went out and preached everywhere , while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the attesting signs and miracles that closely accompanied [ it ] .

AMPC	Luke	1	1	Since [ [ a ] as is well known ] many have undertaken to put in order and draw up a [ [ b ] thorough ] narrative of the surely established deeds which have been accomplished and fulfilled [ c ] in and among us ,
AMPC	Luke	1	2	Exactly as they were handed down to us by those who from the [ [ d ] official ] beginning [ of Jesus ’ ministry ] were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word [ that is , of [ e ] the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] ,
AMPC	Luke	1	3	It seemed good and desirable to me , [ and so I have determined ] also after [ f ] having searched out diligently and followed all things closely and traced accurately the course from the highest to the minutest detail from the very first , to write an orderly account for you , most excellent Theophilus , ( A )
AMPC	Luke	1	4	[ My purpose is ] that you may know the full truth and understand with certainty and security against error the accounts ( histories ) and doctrines of the faith of which you have been informed and in which you have been [ g ] orally instructed .
AMPC	Luke	1	5	In the days when Herod was king of Judea there was a certain priest whose name was Zachariah , [ h ] of the daily service ( the division ) of Abia ; and his wife was also a descendant of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
AMPC	Luke	1	6	And they both were righteous in the sight of God , walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements of the Lord .
AMPC	Luke	1	7	But they had no child , for Elizabeth was barren ; and both were [ i ] far advanced in years .
AMPC	Luke	1	8	Now while on duty , serving as priest before God in the order of his division ,
AMPC	Luke	1	9	As was the custom of the priesthood , it fell to him by lot to enter [ the [ j ] sanctuary of ] the temple of the Lord and burn incense . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	1	10	And all the throng of people were praying outside [ in the court ] at the hour of incense [ burning ] .
AMPC	Luke	1	11	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord , standing at the right side of the altar of incense .
AMPC	Luke	1	12	And when Zachariah saw him , he was troubled , and fear took possession of him .
AMPC	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , Do not be afraid , Zachariah , because your petition [ k ] was heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you must call his name John [ God is favorable ] .
AMPC	Luke	1	14	And you shall have joy and exultant delight , and many will rejoice over his birth ,
AMPC	Luke	1	15	For he will be great and distinguished in the sight of the Lord . And he must drink no wine nor strong drink , and he will be filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit even [ l ] in and from his mother ’ s womb . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	1	16	And he will turn back and cause to return many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God ,
AMPC	Luke	1	17	And he will [ himself ] go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient and incredulous and unpersuadable to the wisdom of the upright [ which is [ m ] the knowledge and holy love of the will of God ] —in order to make ready for the Lord a people [ perfectly ] prepared [ in spirit , [ n ] adjusted and disposed and placed in the right moral state ] .

AMPC	Luke	1	18	And Zachariah said to the angel , By what shall I know and be sure of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is well advanced in years .
AMPC	Luke	1	19	And the angel replied to him , I am Gabriel . I stand in the [ very ] presence of God , and I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	1	20	Now behold , you will be and [ o ] will continue to be silent and not able to speak till the day when these things take place , because you have not believed what I told you ; but my words are [ p ] of a kind which will be fulfilled in the appointed and proper time .
AMPC	Luke	1	21	Now the people kept waiting for Zachariah , and they wondered at his delaying [ so long ] in the [ q ] sanctuary .
AMPC	Luke	1	22	But when he did come out , he was unable to speak to them ; and they [ [ r ] clearly ] perceived that he had seen a vision in the [ s ] sanctuary ; and he kept making signs to them , still he remained dumb .
AMPC	Luke	1	23	And when his time of performing priestly functions was ended , he returned to his [ own ] house .
AMPC	Luke	1	24	Now after this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant , and for five months she secluded herself [ t ] entirely , saying , [ I have hid myself ]
AMPC	Luke	1	25	[ u ] Because thus the Lord has dealt with me in the days when He deigned to look on me to take away my reproach among men . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month [ after that ] , the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named Nazareth ,
AMPC	Luke	1	27	To a girl never having been married and a [ v ] virgin engaged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph , a descendant of the house of David ; and the virgin ’ s name was Mary .
AMPC	Luke	1	28	And he came to her and said , Hail , O favored one [ [ w ] endued with grace ] ! The Lord is with you ! [ x ] Blessed ( favored of God ) are you before all other women !
AMPC	Luke	1	29	But when she saw him , she was greatly troubled and disturbed and confused at what he said and kept revolving in her mind what such a greeting might mean .
AMPC	Luke	1	30	And the angel said to her , Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found grace ( [ y ] free , spontaneous , absolute favor and loving-kindness ) with God .
AMPC	Luke	1	31	And listen ! You will become pregnant and will give birth to a Son , and you shall call His name Jesus .
AMPC	Luke	1	32	He will be great ( eminent ) and will be called the Son of the Most High ; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His forefather David ,
AMPC	Luke	1	33	And He will reign over the house of Jacob throughout the ages ; and of His reign there will be no end . ( G )
AMPC	Luke	1	34	And Mary said to the angel , How can this be , since I have no [ intimacy with any man as a ] husband ?
AMPC	Luke	1	35	Then the angel said to her , The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you [ like a shining cloud ] ; and so the holy ( pure , sinless ) Thing ( Offspring ) which shall be born of you will be called the Son of God . ( H )
AMPC	Luke	1	36	And listen ! Your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son , and this is now the sixth month with her who was called barren .
AMPC	Luke	1	37	For with God nothing is ever impossible and no word from God shall be without power or impossible of fulfillment .
AMPC	Luke	1	38	Then Mary said , Behold , I am the handmaiden of the Lord ; let it be done to me according to what you have said . And the angel left her .
AMPC	Luke	1	39	And at that time Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country to a town of Judah ,
AMPC	Luke	1	40	And she went to the house of Zachariah and , entering it , saluted Elizabeth .
AMPC	Luke	1	41	And it occurred that when Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the baby leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Luke	1	42	And she cried out with a loud cry , and then exclaimed , Blessed ( favored of God ) above all other women are you ! And blessed ( favored of God ) is the Fruit of your womb !
AMPC	Luke	1	43	And how [ have I deserved that this honor should ] be granted to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
AMPC	Luke	1	44	For behold , the instant the sound of your salutation reached my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy .
AMPC	Luke	1	45	And blessed ( happy , [ z ] to be envied ) is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her from the Lord .
AMPC	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , My soul magnifies and extols the Lord ,
AMPC	Luke	1	47	And my spirit rejoices in God my Savior ,
AMPC	Luke	1	48	For He has looked upon the low station and humiliation of His handmaiden . For behold , from now on all generations [ of all ages ] will call me blessed and declare me happy and [ aa ] to be envied !
AMPC	Luke	1	49	For He Who is almighty has done great things for me—and holy is His name [ to be venerated in His purity , majesty and glory ] !
AMPC	Luke	1	50	And His mercy ( His compassion and kindness toward the miserable and afflicted ) is on those who fear Him with godly reverence , from generation to generation and age to age . ( I )
AMPC	Luke	1	51	He has shown strength and [ ab ] made might with His arm ; He has scattered the proud and haughty in and by the imagination and purpose and designs of their hearts .
AMPC	Luke	1	52	He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree .
AMPC	Luke	1	53	He has filled and satisfied the hungry with good things , and the rich He has sent away empty-handed [ without a gift ] .
AMPC	Luke	1	54	He has laid hold on His servant Israel [ to help him , to espouse his cause ] , in remembrance of His mercy ,
AMPC	Luke	1	55	Even as He promised to our forefathers , to Abraham and to his descendants forever . ( J )
AMPC	Luke	1	56	And Mary remained with her [ Elizabeth ] for about three months and [ then ] returned to her [ own ] home .
AMPC	Luke	1	57	Now the time that Elizabeth should be delivered came , and she gave birth to a son .
AMPC	Luke	1	58	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy on her , and they rejoiced with her .
AMPC	Luke	1	59	And it occurred that on the eighth day , when they came to circumcise the child , they were intending to call him Zachariah after his father , ( K )
AMPC	Luke	1	60	But his mother answered , Not so ! But he shall be called John .
AMPC	Luke	1	61	And they said to her , None of your relatives is called by that name .
AMPC	Luke	1	62	And they inquired with signs to his father [ as to ] what he wanted to have him called .
AMPC	Luke	1	63	Then Zachariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote , His name is John . And they were all astonished .
AMPC	Luke	1	64	And at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed , and he began to speak , blessing and praising and thanking God .
AMPC	Luke	1	65	And awe and reverential fear came on all their neighbors ; and all these things were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea .
AMPC	Luke	1	66	And all who heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , Whatever will this little boy be then ? For the hand of the Lord was [ [ ac ] so evidently ] with him [ protecting and aiding him ] .
AMPC	Luke	1	67	Now Zachariah his father was filled with and controlled by the Holy Spirit and prophesied , saying ,
AMPC	Luke	1	68	Blessed ( praised and extolled and thanked ) be the Lord , the God of Israel , because He has come and brought deliverance and redemption to His people !
AMPC	Luke	1	69	And He has raised up a Horn of salvation [ a mighty and valiant Helper , the Author of salvation ] for us in the house of David His servant—
AMPC	Luke	1	70	This is as He promised by the mouth of His holy prophets from the most ancient times [ in the memory of man ] —
AMPC	Luke	1	71	That we should have deliverance and be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who detest and pursue us with hatred ;
AMPC	Luke	1	72	To make true and show the mercy and compassion and kindness [ promised ] to our forefathers and to remember and carry out His holy covenant [ to bless , which is [ ad ] all the more sacred because it is made by God Himself ] ,
AMPC	Luke	1	73	That covenant He sealed by oath to our forefather Abraham :
AMPC	Luke	1	74	To grant us that we , being delivered from the hand of our foes , might serve Him fearlessly
AMPC	Luke	1	75	In holiness ( divine consecration ) and righteousness [ in accordance with the everlasting principles of right ] within His presence all the days of our lives .
AMPC	Luke	1	76	And you , little one , shall be called a prophet of the Most High ; for you shall go on before the face of the Lord to make ready His ways , ( L )
AMPC	Luke	1	77	To bring and give the knowledge of salvation to His people in the forgiveness and remission of their sins .
AMPC	Luke	1	78	Because of and through the heart of tender mercy and loving-kindness of our God , a Light from on high will dawn upon us and visit [ us ] ( M )
AMPC	Luke	1	79	To shine upon and give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to direct and guide our feet in a straight line into the way of peace . ( N )
AMPC	Luke	1	80	And the little boy grew and became strong in spirit ; and he was in the deserts ( wilderness ) until the day of his appearing to Israel [ the commencement of his public ministry ] .

AMPC	Luke	2	2	This was the first enrollment , and it was made when Quirinius was governor of Syria .
AMPC	Luke	2	3	And all the people were going to be registered , each to his own city or town .
AMPC	Luke	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea , to the town of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ,
AMPC	Luke	2	5	To be enrolled with Mary , his espoused ( [ b ] married ) wife , who was about to become a mother . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	2	6	And while they were there , the time came for her delivery ,
AMPC	Luke	2	7	And she gave birth to her Son , her Firstborn ; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger , because there was no room or place for them in the inn .
AMPC	Luke	2	8	And in that vicinity there were shepherds living [ out under the open sky ] in the field , watching [ in shifts ] over their flock by night .
AMPC	Luke	2	9	And behold , an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord flashed and shone all about them , and they were terribly frightened .
AMPC	Luke	2	10	But the angel said to them , Do not be afraid ; for behold , I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people .
AMPC	Luke	2	11	For to you is born this day in the town of David a Savior , Who is Christ ( the Messiah ) the Lord ! ( B )
AMPC	Luke	2	12	And this will be a sign for you [ by which you will recognize Him ] : you will find [ [ c ] after searching ] a Baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	2	13	Then suddenly there appeared with the angel an army of the troops of heaven ( [ d ] a heavenly knighthood ) , praising God and saying ,
AMPC	Luke	2	14	Glory to God in the highest [ heaven ] , and on earth peace among men with whom He is well pleased [ [ e ] men of goodwill , of His favor ] .
AMPC	Luke	2	15	When the angels went away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing ( [ f ] saying ) that has come to pass , which the Lord has made known to us .
AMPC	Luke	2	16	So they went with haste and [ [ g ] by searching ] found Mary and Joseph , and the Baby lying in a manger .
AMPC	Luke	2	17	And when they saw it , they made known what had been told them concerning this Child ,
AMPC	Luke	2	18	And all who heard it were astounded and marveled at what the shepherds told them .
AMPC	Luke	2	19	But Mary was keeping [ h ] within herself all these things ( [ i ] sayings ) , weighing and pondering them in her heart .
AMPC	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen , just as it had been told them .
AMPC	Luke	2	21	And at the end of eight days , when [ the Baby ] was to be circumcised , He was called Jesus , the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb .
AMPC	Luke	2	22	And when the time for their purification [ the mother ’ s purification and the Baby ’ s dedication ] came according to the Law of Moses , they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord— ( D )
AMPC	Luke	2	23	As it is written in the Law of the Lord , Every [ firstborn ] male that opens the womb shall be set apart and dedicated and called holy to the Lord— ( E )
AMPC	Luke	2	24	And [ they came also ] to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord : a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	2	25	Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon , and this man was righteous and devout [ cautiously and carefully observing the divine Law ] , and looking for the Consolation of Israel ; and the Holy Spirit was upon him .
AMPC	Luke	2	26	And it had been divinely revealed ( communicated ) to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord ’ s Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Luke	2	27	And prompted by the [ Holy ] Spirit , he came into the temple [ [ j ] enclosure ] ; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus to do for Him what was customary according to the Law ,
AMPC	Luke	2	28	[ Simeon ] took Him up in his arms and praised and thanked God and said ,
AMPC	Luke	2	29	And now , Lord , You are releasing Your servant to depart ( leave this world ) in peace , according to Your word .
AMPC	Luke	2	30	For with my [ own ] eyes I have seen Your Salvation , ( G )
AMPC	Luke	2	31	Which You have ordained and prepared before ( in the presence of ) all peoples ,
AMPC	Luke	2	32	A Light for [ k ] revelation to the Gentiles [ to disclose what was before unknown ] and [ to bring ] praise and honor and glory to Your people Israel . ( H )
AMPC	Luke	2	33	And His [ legal ] father and [ His ] mother were marveling at what was said about Him .
AMPC	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother , Behold , this Child is appointed and destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel , and for a sign that is spoken against— ( I )
AMPC	Luke	2	35	And a sword will pierce through your own soul also—that the secret thoughts and purposes of many hearts may be brought out and disclosed .
AMPC	Luke	2	36	And there was also a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very old , having lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood , ( J )
AMPC	Luke	2	37	And as a widow even for eighty-four years . She did not go out from the temple [ l ] enclosure , but was worshiping night and day with fasting and prayer .
AMPC	Luke	2	38	And she too came up at that same hour , and she returned thanks to God and talked of [ Jesus ] to all who were looking for the redemption ( deliverance ) of Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	2	39	And when they had done everything according to the Law of the Lord , they went back into Galilee to their own town , Nazareth .
AMPC	Luke	2	40	And the Child grew and became strong in spirit , filled with wisdom ; and the grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) of God was upon Him . ( K )
AMPC	Luke	2	41	Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year to the Passover Feast . ( L )
AMPC	Luke	2	42	And when He was twelve years [ old ] , they went up , as was their custom .
AMPC	Luke	2	43	And when the Feast was ended , as they were returning , the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem . Now His parents did not know this ,
AMPC	Luke	2	44	But , supposing Him to be in the caravan , they traveled on a day ’ s journey ; and [ then ] they sought Him [ diligently , looking up and down for Him ] among their kinsfolk and acquaintances .
AMPC	Luke	2	45	And when they failed to find Him , they went back to Jerusalem , looking for Him [ up and down ] all the way .
AMPC	Luke	2	46	After three days they found Him [ came upon Him ] in the [ m ] [ court of the ] temple , sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
AMPC	Luke	2	47	And all who heard Him were astonished and overwhelmed with bewildered wonder at His intelligence and understanding and His replies .
AMPC	Luke	2	48	And when they [ Joseph and Mary ] saw Him , they were amazed ; and His mother said to Him , Child , why have You treated us like this ? Here Your father and I have been anxiously looking for You [ distressed and tormented ] .
AMPC	Luke	2	49	And He said to them , How is it that you had to look for Me ? Did you not see and know that it is necessary [ as a duty ] for Me [ n ] to be in My Father ’ s house and [ occupied ] about My Father ’ s business ?
AMPC	Luke	2	50	But they did not comprehend what He was saying to them .
AMPC	Luke	2	51	And He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was [ habitually ] obedient to them ; and his mother kept and closely and persistently guarded all these things in her heart .
AMPC	Luke	2	52	And Jesus increased in wisdom ( in broad and full understanding ) and in stature and years , and in favor with God and man . Footnotes - Luke 2:1 George R.

AMPC	Luke	3	3	And he went into all the country round about the Jordan , preaching a baptism of repentance ( [ b ] of hearty amending of their ways , with abhorrence of past wrongdoing ) unto the forgiveness of sin .
AMPC	Luke	3	2	In the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the Word of God [ [ a ] concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God ] came to John son of Zachariah in the wilderness ( desert ) .
AMPC	Luke	3	4	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , The voice of one crying in the wilderness [ shouting in the desert ] : Prepare the way of the Lord , make His beaten paths straight .
AMPC	Luke	3	5	Every valley and ravine shall be filled up , and every mountain and hill shall be leveled ; and the crooked places shall be made straight , and the rough roads shall be made smooth ;
AMPC	Luke	3	6	And all mankind shall see ( behold and [ c ] understand and at last acknowledge ) the salvation of God ( the deliverance from eternal death [ d ] decreed by God ) . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	3	7	So he said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him , You offspring of vipers ! Who [ e ] secretly warned you to flee from the coming wrath ?
AMPC	Luke	3	8	Bear fruits that are deserving and consistent with [ your ] repentance [ that is , [ f ] conduct worthy of a heart changed , a heart abhorring sin ] . And do not begin to say to yourselves , We have Abraham as our father ; for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up descendants for Abraham .
AMPC	Luke	3	9	Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees , so that every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire .
AMPC	Luke	3	10	And the multitudes asked him , Then what shall we do ?
AMPC	Luke	3	11	And he replied to them , He who has two tunics ( undergarments ) , let him share with him who has none ; and he who has food , let him do it the same way .
AMPC	Luke	3	12	Even tax collectors came to be baptized , and they said to him , Teacher , what shall we do ?
AMPC	Luke	3	13	And he said to them , Exact and collect no more than the fixed amount appointed you .
AMPC	Luke	3	14	Those serving as soldiers also asked him , And we , what shall we do ? And he replied to them , Never demand or enforce [ g ] by terrifying people or by accusing wrongfully , and always be satisfied with your rations ( supplies ) and with your allowance ( wages ) .
AMPC	Luke	3	15	As the people were in suspense and waiting expectantly , and everybody reasoned and questioned in their hearts concerning John , whether he perhaps might be the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Luke	3	16	John answered them all by saying , I baptize you with water ; but He Who is mightier than I is coming , the strap of Whose sandals I am not fit to unfasten . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire .
AMPC	Luke	3	17	His winnowing shovel ( fork ) is in His hand to thoroughly clear and cleanse His [ threshing ] floor and to gather the wheat and store it in His granary , but the chaff He will burn with fire that can not be extinguished .
AMPC	Luke	3	18	So with many other [ various ] appeals and admonitions he preached the good news ( the Gospel ) to the people .
AMPC	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , who had been [ repeatedly ] told about his fault and reproved with rebuke [ h ] producing conviction by [ John ] for [ having ] Herodias , his brother ’ s wife , and for all the wicked things that Herod had done ,
AMPC	Luke	3	20	Added this to them all—that he shut up John in prison .
AMPC	Luke	3	21	Now when all the people were baptized , and when Jesus also had been baptized , and [ while He was still ] praying , the [ visible ] heaven was opened
AMPC	Luke	3	22	And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove , and a voice came from heaven , saying , You are My Son , My Beloved ! In You I am well pleased and find delight ! ( B )

AMPC	Luke	4	4	And Jesus replied to him , It is written , Man shall not live and be sustained by ( on ) bread alone [ b ] but by every word and expression of God . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	4	2	For ( during ) forty days in the wilderness ( desert ) , where He was tempted ( [ a ] tried , tested exceedingly ) by the devil . And He ate nothing during those days , and when they were completed , He was hungry . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	4	3	Then the devil said to Him , If You are the Son of God , order this stone to turn into a loaf [ of bread ] .
AMPC	Luke	4	5	Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time [ [ c ] in the twinkling of an eye ] .
AMPC	Luke	4	6	And he said to Him , To You I will give all this power and authority and their glory ( all their magnificence , excellence , preeminence , dignity , and grace ) , for it has been turned over to me , and I give it to whomever I will .
AMPC	Luke	4	7	Therefore if You will do homage to and worship me [ [ d ] just once ] , it shall all be Yours .
AMPC	Luke	4	8	And Jesus replied to him , [ e ] Get behind Me , Satan ! It is written , You shall do homage to and worship the Lord your God , and Him only shall you serve . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	4	9	Then he took Him to Jerusalem and set Him on [ f ] a gable of the temple , and said to Him , If You are the Son of God , cast Yourself down from here ;
AMPC	Luke	4	10	For it is written , He will give His angels charge over you to guard and watch over you closely and carefully ;
AMPC	Luke	4	11	And on their hands they will bear you up , lest you strike your foot against a stone . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	4	12	And Jesus replied to him , [ The Scripture ] says , You shall not tempt ( try , [ g ] test exceedingly ) the Lord your God . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	4	13	And when the devil had ended every [ the complete cycle of ] temptation , he [ temporarily ] left Him [ that is , [ h ] stood off from Him ] until another more opportune and favorable time .
AMPC	Luke	4	14	Then Jesus went back full of and under the power of the [ Holy ] Spirit into Galilee , and the fame of Him spread through the whole region round about .
AMPC	Luke	4	15	And He Himself conducted [ [ i ] a course of ] teaching in their synagogues , being [ j ] recognized and honored and praised by all .
AMPC	Luke	4	16	So He came to Nazareth , [ [ k ] that Nazareth ] where He had been brought up , and He entered the synagogue , as was His custom on the Sabbath day . And He stood up to read .
AMPC	Luke	4	17	And there was handed to Him [ the roll of ] the book of the prophet Isaiah . He opened ( unrolled ) the book and found the place where it was written , ( F )
AMPC	Luke	4	18	The Spirit of the Lord [ is ] upon Me , because He has anointed Me [ the Anointed One , the Messiah ] to preach the good news ( the Gospel ) to the poor ; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind , to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [ who are downtrodden , bruised , crushed , and broken down by calamity ] ,
AMPC	Luke	4	19	To proclaim the accepted and acceptable year of the Lord [ the day [ l ] when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound ] . ( G )
AMPC	Luke	4	20	Then He rolled up the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing [ attentively ] at Him .
AMPC	Luke	4	21	And He began to speak to them : Today this Scripture has been fulfilled [ m ] while you are present and hearing .
AMPC	Luke	4	22	And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came forth from His mouth ; and they said , Is not this Joseph ’ s [ n ] Son ?
AMPC	Luke	4	23	So He said to them , You will doubtless quote to Me this proverb : Physician , heal Yourself ! What we have learned by hearsay that You did in Capernaum , do here also in Your [ own ] town .
AMPC	Luke	4	24	Then He said , Solemnly I say to you , no prophet is acceptable and welcome in his [ own ] town ( country ) .
AMPC	Luke	4	25	But in truth I tell you , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heavens were closed up for three years and six months , so that there came a great famine over all the land ;
AMPC	Luke	4	26	And yet Elijah was not sent to a single one of them , but only to Zarephath in the country of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow . ( H )
AMPC	Luke	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and yet not one of them was cleansed [ by being healed ] —but only Naaman the Syrian . ( I )
AMPC	Luke	4	28	When they heard these things , all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage .
AMPC	Luke	4	29	And rising up , they pushed and drove Him out of the town , and [ laying hold of Him ] they led Him to the [ projecting ] upper part of the hill on which their town was built , that they might hurl Him headlong down [ over the cliff ] .
AMPC	Luke	4	30	But passing through their midst , He went on His way .
AMPC	Luke	4	31	And He descended to Capernaum , a town of Galilee , and there He continued to teach the people on the Sabbath days .
AMPC	Luke	4	32	And they were amazed at His teaching , for His word was with authority and ability and weight and power .
AMPC	Luke	4	33	Now in the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by the foul spirit of a demon ; and he cried out with a loud ( deep , terrible ) cry ,
AMPC	Luke	4	34	Ah , [ o ] let us alone ! What have You to do with us [ What have [ p ] we in common ] , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know Who You are—the Holy One of God !
AMPC	Luke	4	35	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , Be silent ( muzzled , gagged ) , and come out of him ! And when the demon had thrown the man down in their midst , he came out of him without injuring him in any [ q ] possible way .
AMPC	Luke	4	36	And they were all amazed and said to one another , What kind of talk is this ? For with authority and power He commands the foul spirits and they come out !
AMPC	Luke	4	37	And a rumor about Him spread into every place in the surrounding country .
AMPC	Luke	4	38	Then He arose and left the synagogue and went into Simon ’ s ( Peter ’ s ) house . Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law was suffering in the grip of a burning fever , and they pleaded with Him for her .
AMPC	Luke	4	39	And standing over her , He rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and immediately she got up and began waiting on them .
AMPC	Luke	4	40	Now at the setting of the sun [ indicating the end of the Sabbath ] , all those who had any [ who were ] sick with various diseases brought them to Him , and He laid His hands upon every one of them and cured them .
AMPC	Luke	4	41	And demons even came out of many people , screaming and crying out , You are the Son of God ! But He rebuked them and would not permit them to speak , because they knew that He was the Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Luke	4	42	And when daybreak came , He left [ Peter ’ s house ] and went into an isolated [ desert ] place . And the people looked for Him until they came up to Him and tried to prevent Him from leaving them .
AMPC	Luke	4	43	But He said to them , I must preach the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God to the other cities [ and towns ] also , for I was sent for this [ purpose ] .
AMPC	Luke	4	44	And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee .

AMPC	Luke	5	5	And Simon ( Peter ) answered , Master , we toiled all night [ [ a ] exhaustingly ] and caught nothing [ in our nets ] . But [ b ] on the ground of Your word , I will lower the nets [ again ] .
AMPC	Luke	5	2	And He saw two boats drawn up by the lake , but the fishermen had gone down from them and were washing their nets .
AMPC	Luke	5	3	And getting into one of the boats , [ the one ] that belonged to Simon ( Peter ) , He requested him to draw away a little from the shore . Then He sat down and continued to teach the crowd [ of people ] from the boat .
AMPC	Luke	5	4	When He had stopped speaking , He said to Simon ( Peter ) , Put out into the deep [ water ] , and lower your nets for a haul .
AMPC	Luke	5	6	And when they had done this , they caught a great number of fish ; and as their nets were [ [ c ] at the point of ] breaking ,
AMPC	Luke	5	7	They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and take hold with them . And they came and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink .
AMPC	Luke	5	8	But when Simon Peter saw this , he fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
AMPC	Luke	5	9	For he was gripped with bewildering amazement [ allied to terror ] , and all who were with him , at the haul of fish which they had made ;
AMPC	Luke	5	10	And so also were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon ( Peter ) . And Jesus said to Simon , Have no fear ; from now on you will be catching men !
AMPC	Luke	5	11	And after they had run their boats on shore , they left everything and [ d ] joined Him as His disciples and sided with His party and accompanied Him .
AMPC	Luke	5	12	While He was in one of the towns , there came a man full of ( covered with ) leprosy ; and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face and implored Him , saying , Lord , if You are willing , You are able to cure me and make me clean .
AMPC	Luke	5	13	And [ Jesus ] reached out His hand and touched him , saying , I am willing ; be cleansed ! And immediately the leprosy left him .
AMPC	Luke	5	14	And [ Jesus ] charged him to tell no one [ [ e ] that he might chance to meet ] , [ f ] until [ He said ] you go and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your purification , as Moses commanded , for a testimony and proof to the people , that they may have evidence [ of your healing ] . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	5	15	But so much the more the news spread abroad concerning Him , and great crowds kept coming together to hear [ Him ] and to be healed by Him of their infirmities .
AMPC	Luke	5	16	But He Himself withdrew [ in retirement ] to the wilderness ( desert ) and prayed .
AMPC	Luke	5	17	One of those days , as He was teaching , there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by , who had come from every village and town of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem . And the power of the Lord was [ present ] with Him to heal [ g ] them .
AMPC	Luke	5	18	And behold , some men were bringing on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed , and they tried to carry him in and lay him before [ Jesus ] .
AMPC	Luke	5	19	But finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and lowered him with his stretcher through the tiles into the midst , in front of Jesus .
AMPC	Luke	5	20	And when He saw [ their confidence in Him , springing from ] their faith , He said , Man , your sins are forgiven you !
AMPC	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason and question and argue , saying , Who is this [ Man ] Who speaks blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ?
AMPC	Luke	5	22	But Jesus , knowing their thoughts and questionings , answered them , Why do you question in your hearts ?
AMPC	Luke	5	23	Which is easier : to say , Your sins are forgiven you , or to say , Arise and walk [ about ] ?
AMPC	Luke	5	24	But that you may know that the Son of Man has the [ [ h ] power of ] authority and right on earth to forgive sins , He said to the paralyzed man , I say to you , arise , pick up your litter ( stretcher ) , and go to your own house !
AMPC	Luke	5	25	And instantly [ the man ] stood up before them and picked up what he had been lying on and went away to his house , [ i ] recognizing and praising and thanking God .
AMPC	Luke	5	26	And overwhelming astonishment and ecstasy seized them all , and they [ j ] recognized and praised and thanked God ; and they were filled with and controlled by reverential fear and kept saying , We have seen wonderful and strange and incredible and unthinkable things today !
AMPC	Luke	5	27	And after this , Jesus went out and looked [ attentively ] at a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office ; and He said to him , [ k ] Join Me as a disciple and side with My party and accompany Me .
AMPC	Luke	5	28	And he forsook everything and got up and followed Him [ becoming His disciple and siding with His party ] .
AMPC	Luke	5	29	And Levi ( Matthew ) made a great banquet for Him in his own house , and there was a large company of tax collectors and others who were reclining [ at the table ] with them .
AMPC	Luke	5	30	Now the Pharisees and their scribes were grumbling against Jesus ’ disciples , saying , Why are you eating and drinking with tax collectors and [ preeminently ] sinful people ?
AMPC	Luke	5	31	And Jesus replied to them , It is not those who are healthy who need a physician , but those who are sick .
AMPC	Luke	5	32	I have not come to arouse and invite and call the righteous , but [ l ] the erring ones ( [ m ] those not free from sin ) to repentance [ [ n ] to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ] .
AMPC	Luke	5	33	Then they said to Him , The disciples of John practice fasting often and offer up prayers of [ special ] petition , and so do [ the disciples ] of the Pharisees also , but Yours eat and drink .
AMPC	Luke	5	34	And Jesus said to them , Can you make the wedding guests fast as long as the bridegroom is with them ?
AMPC	Luke	5	35	But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them ; and then they will fast in those days .
AMPC	Luke	5	36	He told them a [ o ] proverb also : No one puts a patch from a new garment on an old garment ; if he does , he will both tear the new one , and the patch from the new [ one ] will not match the old [ garment ] .
AMPC	Luke	5	37	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins ; if he does , the fresh wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled and the skins will be ruined ( destroyed ) .
AMPC	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
AMPC	Luke	5	39	And no one after drinking old wine immediately desires new wine , for he says , The old is good or [ p ] better .

AMPC	Luke	6	6	And it occurred on another Sabbath that when He went into the synagogue and taught , a man was present whose right hand was withered .
AMPC	Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees asked them , Why are you doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath days ? ( B )
AMPC	Luke	6	3	And Jesus replied to them , saying , Have you never so much as read what David did when he was hungry , he and those who were with him ? — ( C )
AMPC	Luke	6	4	How he went into the house of God and took and ate the [ sacred ] loaves of the showbread , which it is not permitted for any except only the priests to eat , and also gave to those [ who were ] with him ? ( D )
AMPC	Luke	6	5	And He said to them , The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath .
AMPC	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and the Pharisees kept watching Jesus to see whether He would [ actually ] heal on the Sabbath , in order that they might get [ some ground for ] accusation against Him .
AMPC	Luke	6	8	But He was aware all along of their thoughts , and He said to the man with the withered hand , Come and stand here in the midst . And he arose and stood there .
AMPC	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them , I ask you , is it lawful and right on the Sabbath to do good [ [ a ] so that someone derives advantage from it ] or to do evil , to save a life [ and [ b ] make a soul safe ] or to destroy it ?
AMPC	Luke	6	10	Then He glanced around at them all and said to the man , Stretch out your hand ! And he did so , and his hand was fully restored [ c ] like the other one .
AMPC	Luke	6	11	But they were filled with lack of understanding and senseless rage and discussed ( consulted ) with one another what they might do to Jesus .
AMPC	Luke	6	12	Now in those days it occurred that He went up into a mountain to pray , and spent the whole night in prayer to God .
AMPC	Luke	6	13	And when it was day , He summoned His disciples and selected from them twelve , whom He named apostles ( special messengers ) :
AMPC	Luke	6	14	They were Simon , whom He named Peter , and his brother Andrew ; and James and John ; and Philip and Bartholomew ;
AMPC	Luke	6	15	And Matthew and Thomas ; and James son of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot ,
AMPC	Luke	6	16	And Judas son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor ( a treacherous , basely faithless person ) .
AMPC	Luke	6	17	And Jesus came down with them and took His stand on a level spot , with a great crowd of His disciples and a vast throng of people from all over Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to listen to Him and to be cured of their diseases—
AMPC	Luke	6	18	Even those who were disturbed and troubled with unclean spirits , and they were being healed [ also ] .
AMPC	Luke	6	19	And all the multitude were seeking to touch Him , for healing power was all the while going forth from Him and curing them all [ [ d ] saving them from severe illnesses or calamities ] .
AMPC	Luke	6	20	And solemnly lifting up His eyes on His disciples , He said : Blessed ( happy— [ e ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition—and [ f ] to be envied ) are you poor and [ g ] lowly and afflicted ( destitute of wealth , influence , position , and honor ) , for the kingdom of God is yours !
AMPC	Luke	6	21	Blessed ( happy— [ h ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition—and [ i ] to be envied ) are you who hunger and seek with eager desire now , for you shall be filled and completely satisfied ! Blessed ( happy— [ j ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition—and [ k ] to be envied ) are you who weep and sob now , for you shall laugh !
AMPC	Luke	6	22	Blessed ( happy— [ l ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , apart from your outward condition—and [ m ] to be envied ) are you when people despise ( hate ) you , and when they exclude and excommunicate you [ as disreputable ] and revile and denounce you and defame and cast out and spurn your name as evil ( wicked ) on account of the Son of Man .
AMPC	Luke	6	23	Rejoice and be glad at such a time and exult and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is rich and great and strong and intense and abundant in heaven ; for even so their forefathers treated the prophets .
AMPC	Luke	6	24	But woe to ( alas for ) you who are rich ( [ n ] abounding in material resources ) , for you already are receiving your consolation ( the solace and sense of strengthening and cheer that come from prosperity ) and have taken and enjoyed your comfort in full [ having nothing left to be awarded you ] .
AMPC	Luke	6	25	Woe to ( alas for ) you who are full now ( completely filled , luxuriously gorged and satiated ) , for you shall hunger and suffer want ! Woe to ( alas for ) you who laugh now , for you shall mourn and weep and wail !
AMPC	Luke	6	26	Woe to ( alas for ) you when everyone speaks fairly and handsomely of you and praises you , for even so their forefathers did to the false prophets .
AMPC	Luke	6	27	But I say to you who are listening now to Me : [ [ o ] in order to heed , make it a practice to ] love your enemies , treat well ( do good to , act nobly toward ) those who detest you and pursue you with hatred ,
AMPC	Luke	6	28	Invoke blessings upon and pray for the happiness of those who curse you , implore God ’ s blessing ( favor ) upon those who abuse you [ who revile , reproach , disparage , and high-handedly misuse you ] .
AMPC	Luke	6	29	To the one who strikes you on the [ p ] jaw or cheek , offer the other [ q ] jaw or cheek also ; and from him who takes away your outer garment , do not withhold your undergarment as well .
AMPC	Luke	6	30	Give away to everyone who begs of you [ who is [ r ] in want of necessities ] , and of him who takes away from you your goods , do not demand or require them back again .
AMPC	Luke	6	31	And as you would like and desire that men would do to you , do exactly so to them .
AMPC	Luke	6	32	If you [ merely ] love those who love you , what [ s ] quality of credit and thanks is that to you ? For even [ t ] the [ very ] sinners love their lovers ( those who love them ) .
AMPC	Luke	6	33	And if you are kind and good and do favors to and benefit those who are kind and good and do favors to and benefit you , what [ u ] quality of credit and thanks is that to you ? For even [ v ] the preeminently sinful do the same .
AMPC	Luke	6	34	And if you lend money [ w ] at interest to those from whom you hope to receive , what [ x ] quality of credit and thanks is that to you ? Even notorious sinners lend money [ y ] at interest to sinners , so as to recover as much again .
AMPC	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies and be kind and do good [ doing favors [ z ] so that someone derives benefit from them ] and lend , expecting and hoping for nothing in return but [ aa ] considering nothing as lost and despairing of no one ; and then your recompense ( your reward ) will be great ( rich , strong , intense , and abundant ) , and you will be sons of the Most High , for He is kind and charitable and good to the ungrateful and the selfish and wicked .
AMPC	Luke	6	36	So be merciful ( sympathetic , tender , responsive , and compassionate ) even as your Father is [ all these ] .
AMPC	Luke	6	37	Judge not [ neither pronouncing judgment nor subjecting to censure ] , and you will not be judged ; do not condemn and pronounce guilty , and you will not be condemned and pronounced guilty ; acquit and forgive and [ ab ] release ( give up resentment , let it drop ) , and you will be acquitted and forgiven and [ ac ] released .
AMPC	Luke	6	38	Give , and [ gifts ] will be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will they pour [ ad ] into [ the pouch formed by ] the bosom [ of your robe and used as a bag ] . For with the measure you deal out [ with the measure you use when you confer benefits on others ] , it will be measured back to you .
AMPC	Luke	6	39	He further told them [ ae ] a proverb : Can a blind [ man ] guide and direct a blind [ man ] ? Will they not both stumble into a ditch or a [ af ] hole in the ground ?
AMPC	Luke	6	40	A pupil is not superior to his teacher , but everyone [ when he is ] completely trained ( readjusted , restored , set to rights , and perfected ) will be like his teacher .
AMPC	Luke	6	41	Why do you see the speck that is in your brother ’ s eye but do not notice or consider the beam [ of timber ] that is in your own eye ?
AMPC	Luke	6	42	Or how can you say to your brother , Brother , allow me to take out the speck that is in your eye , when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye ? You actor ( pretender , hypocrite ) ! First take the beam out of your own eye , and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother ’ s eye .
AMPC	Luke	6	43	For there is no good ( healthy ) tree that bears decayed ( worthless , stale ) fruit , nor on the other hand does a decayed ( worthless , sickly ) tree bear good fruit .
AMPC	Luke	6	44	For each tree is known and identified by its own fruit ; for figs are not gathered from thornbushes , nor is a cluster of grapes picked from a bramblebush .
AMPC	Luke	6	45	The upright ( honorable , intrinsically good ) man out of the good treasure [ stored ] in his heart produces what is upright ( honorable and intrinsically good ) , and the evil man out of the evil storehouse brings forth that which is depraved ( wicked and intrinsically evil ) ; for out of the abundance ( overflow ) of the heart his mouth speaks .
AMPC	Luke	6	46	Why do you call Me , Lord , Lord , and do not [ practice ] what I tell you ?
AMPC	Luke	6	47	For everyone who comes to Me and listens to My words [ in order to heed their teaching ] and does them , I will show you what he is like :
AMPC	Luke	6	48	He is like a man building a house , who dug and went down deep and laid a foundation upon the rock ; and when a flood arose , the torrent broke against that house and could not shake or move it , because it had been securely built or [ ag ] founded on a rock .
AMPC	Luke	6	49	But he who merely hears and does not practice doing My words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation , against which the torrent burst , and immediately it collapsed and fell , and the breaking and ruin of that house was great .

AMPC	Luke	7	7	Neither did I consider myself worthy to come to You . But [ just ] speak a word , and my servant boy will be healed .
AMPC	Luke	7	2	Now a centurion had a bond servant who was held in honor and highly valued by him , who was sick and at the point of death .
AMPC	Luke	7	3	And when the centurion heard of Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to Him , requesting Him to come and make his bond servant well .
AMPC	Luke	7	4	And when they reached Jesus , they begged Him earnestly , saying , He is worthy that You should do this for him ,
AMPC	Luke	7	5	For he loves our nation and he built us our synagogue [ at his own expense ] .
AMPC	Luke	7	6	And Jesus went with them . But when He was not far from the house , the centurion sent [ some ] friends to Him , saying , Lord , do not trouble [ Yourself ] , for I am not [ a ] sufficiently worthy to have You come under my roof ;
AMPC	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man [ daily ] subject to authority , with soldiers under me . And I say to one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my bond servant , Do this , and he does it .
AMPC	Luke	7	9	Now when Jesus heard this , He marveled at him , and He turned and said to the crowd that followed Him , I tell you , not even in [ all ] Israel have I found such great faith [ as this ] .
AMPC	Luke	7	10	And when the messengers who had been sent returned to the house , they found the bond servant [ b ] who had been ill quite well again .
AMPC	Luke	7	11	[ c ] Soon afterward , Jesus went to a town called Nain , and His disciples and a great throng accompanied Him .
AMPC	Luke	7	12	[ Just ] as He drew near the gate of the town , behold , a man who had died was being carried out—the only son of his mother , and she was a widow ; and a large gathering from the town was accompanying her .
AMPC	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , He had compassion on her and said to her , Do not weep .
AMPC	Luke	7	14	And He went forward and touched the funeral bier , and the pallbearers stood still . And He said , Young man , I say to you , arise [ [ d ] from death ] !
AMPC	Luke	7	15	And the man [ who was ] dead sat up and began to speak . And [ Jesus ] gave him [ back ] to his mother .
AMPC	Luke	7	16	Profound and reverent fear seized them all , and they began [ e ] to recognize God and praise and give thanks , saying , A great [ f ] Prophet has appeared among us ! And God has visited His people [ in order to help and care for and provide for them ] !
AMPC	Luke	7	17	And this report concerning [ Jesus ] spread through the whole of Judea and all the country round about . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	7	18	And John ’ s disciples brought him [ who was now in prison ] word of all these things .
AMPC	Luke	7	19	And John summoned to him a certain two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord , saying , Are You He Who is to come , or shall we [ continue to ] look for another ?
AMPC	Luke	7	20	So the men came to Jesus and said , John the Baptist sent us to You to ask , Are You the One Who is to come , or shall we [ continue to ] look for another ?
AMPC	Luke	7	21	In that very hour Jesus was healing many [ people ] of sicknesses and distressing bodily plagues and evil spirits , and to many who were blind He gave [ [ g ] a free , gracious , joy-giving gift of ] sight .
AMPC	Luke	7	22	So He replied to them , Go and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the good news ( the Gospel ) preached to them . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	7	23	And blessed ( happy— [ h ] with life-joy and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , apart from outward conditions—and [ i ] to be envied ) is he who takes no offense in Me and who is not hurt or resentful or annoyed or repelled or made to stumble [ [ j ] whatever may occur ] .
AMPC	Luke	7	24	And the messengers of John having departed , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : What did you go out into the desert to gaze on ? A reed shaken and swayed by the wind ?
AMPC	Luke	7	25	Then what did you go out to see ? A man dressed up in soft garments ? Behold , those who wear fine apparel and live in luxury are in the courts or palaces of kings .
AMPC	Luke	7	26	What then did you go out to see ? A prophet ( a forthteller ) ? Yes , I tell you , and far more than a prophet .
AMPC	Luke	7	27	This is the one of whom it is written , Behold , I send My messenger before Your face , who shall make ready Your way before You . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	7	28	I tell you , among those born of women there is no one greater than John ; but [ k ] he that is inferior [ to the other citizens ] in the kingdom of God is greater [ in incomparable privilege ] than he .
AMPC	Luke	7	29	And all the people who heard Him , even the tax collectors , acknowledged the justice of God [ in [ l ] calling them to repentance and in pronouncing future wrath on the impenitent ] , being baptized with the baptism of John .
AMPC	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers [ of the Mosaic Law ] annulled and rejected and brought to nothing God ’ s purpose concerning themselves , by [ refusing and ] not being baptized by him [ John ] .
AMPC	Luke	7	31	So to what shall I compare the men of this generation ? And what are they like ?
AMPC	Luke	7	32	They are like little children sitting in the marketplace , calling to one another and saying , We piped to you [ playing wedding ] , and you did not dance ; we sang dirges and wailed [ playing funeral ] , and you did not weep .
AMPC	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you say , He has a demon .
AMPC	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , Behold , a Man Who is a glutton and a wine drinker , a friend of tax collectors and notorious sinners .
AMPC	Luke	7	35	Yet wisdom is vindicated ( [ m ] shown to be true and divine ) by all her children [ [ n ] by their life , character , and deeds ] .
AMPC	Luke	7	36	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him , and He went into the Pharisee ’ s house and reclined at table .
AMPC	Luke	7	37	And behold , a woman of the town who was [ o ] an especially wicked sinner , when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee ’ s house , brought an alabaster flask of ointment ( perfume ) .
AMPC	Luke	7	38	And standing behind Him at His feet weeping , she began to wet His feet with [ her ] tears ; and she wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed His feet [ affectionately ] and anointed them with the ointment ( perfume ) .
AMPC	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw it , he said to himself , If this Man were a prophet , He would surely know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him—for she is a notorious sinner ( a social outcast , devoted to sin ) .
AMPC	Luke	7	40	And Jesus , replying , said to him , Simon , I have something to say to you . And he answered , Teacher , say it .
AMPC	Luke	7	41	A certain lender of money [ at interest ] had two debtors : one owed him five hundred denarii , and the other fifty .
AMPC	Luke	7	42	When they had no means of paying , he freely forgave them both . Now which of them will love him more ?
AMPC	Luke	7	43	Simon answered , The one , I take it , for whom he forgave and cancelled more . And Jesus said to him , You have decided correctly .
AMPC	Luke	7	44	Then turning toward the woman , He said to Simon , Do you see this woman ? When I came into your house , you gave Me no water for My feet , but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
AMPC	Luke	7	45	You gave Me no kiss , but she from the moment I came in has not ceased [ [ p ] intermittently ] to kiss My feet tenderly and caressingly .
AMPC	Luke	7	46	You did not anoint My head with [ q ] [ cheap , ordinary ] oil , but she has anointed My feet with [ r ] [ costly , rare ] perfume .
AMPC	Luke	7	47	Therefore I tell you , her sins , many [ as they are ] , are forgiven her—because she has loved much . But he who is forgiven little loves little .
AMPC	Luke	7	48	And He said to her , Your sins are forgiven !
AMPC	Luke	7	49	Then those who were at table with Him began to say among themselves , Who is this Who even forgives sins ?
AMPC	Luke	7	50	But Jesus said to the woman , Your faith has saved you ; go ( enter ) [ s ] into peace [ [ t ] in freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ] .

AMPC	Luke	8	8	And some seed fell into good soil , and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times [ as great ] . As He said these things , He called out , He who has ears to hear , let him be listening and let him [ b ] consider and understand by hearing !
AMPC	Luke	8	2	And also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had been expelled ;
AMPC	Luke	8	3	And Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod ’ s household manager ; and Susanna ; and many others , who ministered to and provided for [ a ] Him and them out of their property and personal belongings .
AMPC	Luke	8	4	And when a very great throng was gathering together and people from town after town kept coming to Jesus , He said in a parable :
AMPC	Luke	8	5	A sower went out to sow seed ; and as he sowed , some fell along the traveled path and was trodden underfoot , and the birds of the air ate it up .
AMPC	Luke	8	6	And some [ seed ] fell on the rock , and as soon as it sprouted , it withered away because it had no moisture .
AMPC	Luke	8	7	And other [ seed ] fell in the midst of the thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it [ off ] .
AMPC	Luke	8	9	And when His disciples asked Him the meaning of this parable ,
AMPC	Luke	8	10	He said to them , To you it has been given to [ come progressively to ] know ( to recognize and understand more strongly and clearly ) the mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God , but for others they are in parables , so that , [ though ] looking , they may not see ; and hearing , they may not comprehend . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	8	11	Now the meaning of the parable is this : The seed is the Word of God .
AMPC	Luke	8	12	Those along the traveled road are the people who have heard ; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts , that they may not believe ( [ c ] acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me ) and be saved [ here and hereafter ] .
AMPC	Luke	8	13	And those upon the rock [ are the people ] who , when they hear [ the Word ] , receive and welcome it with joy ; but these have no root . They believe for a while , and in time of trial and temptation fall away ( withdraw and stand aloof ) .
AMPC	Luke	8	14	And as for what fell among the thorns , these are [ the people ] who hear , but as they go on their way they are choked and suffocated with the anxieties and cares and riches and pleasures of life , and their fruit does not ripen ( come to maturity and perfection ) .
AMPC	Luke	8	15	But as for that [ seed ] in the good soil , these are [ the people ] who , hearing the Word , hold it fast in a just ( [ d ] noble , virtuous ) and worthy heart , and steadily bring forth fruit with patience .
AMPC	Luke	8	16	No one after he has lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a [ dining table ] couch ; but he puts it on a lampstand , that those who come in may see the light .
AMPC	Luke	8	17	For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed , nor anything secret that shall not be known and come out into the open .
AMPC	Luke	8	18	Be careful therefore how you listen . For to him who has [ spiritual knowledge ] will more be given ; and from him who does not have [ spiritual knowledge ] , even what he thinks and [ e ] guesses and [ f ] supposes that he has will be taken away .
AMPC	Luke	8	19	Then Jesus ’ mother and His brothers came along toward Him , but they could not get to Him because of the crowd .
AMPC	Luke	8	20	And it was told Him , Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside , desiring to have an interview with You .
AMPC	Luke	8	21	But He answered them , My mother and My brothers are those who listen to the Word of God and do it !
AMPC	Luke	8	22	One of those days He and His disciples got into a boat , and He said to them , Let us go across to the other side of the lake . So they put out to sea .
AMPC	Luke	8	23	But as they were sailing , He fell off to sleep . And a [ g ] whirlwind revolving from below upwards swept down on the lake , and the boat was filling with water , and they were in great danger .
AMPC	Luke	8	24	And the disciples came and woke Him , saying , Master , Master , we are perishing ! And He , being thoroughly awakened , [ h ] censured and [ i ] blamed and rebuked the wind and the raging waves ; and they ceased , and there came a calm .
AMPC	Luke	8	25	And He said to them , [ Why are you so fearful ? ] Where is your faith ( your trust , your confidence in Me—in My veracity and My integrity ) ? And they were seized with alarm and profound and reverent dread , and they marveled , saying to one another , Who then is this , that He commands even wind and sea , and they obey Him ?
AMPC	Luke	8	26	Then they came to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
AMPC	Luke	8	27	Now when Jesus stepped out on land , there met Him a certain man out of the town who had [ was possessed by ] demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes , and he lived not in a house but in the tombs .
AMPC	Luke	8	28	And when he saw Jesus , he raised a deep ( terrible ) cry [ from the depths of his throat ] and fell down before Him [ in terror ] and shouted loudly , What have You [ to do ] with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? [ [ j ] What have we in common ? ] I beg You , do not torment me !
AMPC	Luke	8	29	For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For many times it had snatched and held him ; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters , but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilderness ( desert ) .
AMPC	Luke	8	30	Jesus then asked him , What is your name ? And he answered , Legion ; for many demons had entered him .
AMPC	Luke	8	31	And they begged [ Jesus ] not to command them to depart into the Abyss ( bottomless pit ) . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	8	32	Now a great herd of swine was there feeding on the hillside ; and [ the demons ] begged Him to give them leave to enter these . And He allowed them [ to do so ] .
AMPC	Luke	8	33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep cliff into the lake and were drowned .
AMPC	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and told it in the town and in the country .
AMPC	Luke	8	35	And [ people ] went out to see what had occurred , and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed and in his right ( sound ) mind ; and they were seized with alarm and fear .
AMPC	Luke	8	36	And those [ also ] who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was restored [ to health ] .
AMPC	Luke	8	37	Then all the people of the country surrounding the Gerasenes ’ district asked [ Jesus ] to depart from them , for they were possessed and suffering with dread and terror ; so He entered a boat and returned [ to the west side of the Sea of Galilee ] .
AMPC	Luke	8	38	But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging and [ k ] praying that he might accompany Him and be with Him , but [ Jesus ] sent him away , saying ,
AMPC	Luke	8	39	Return to your home , and recount [ the story ] of how many and great things God has done for you . And [ the man ] departed , proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him .
AMPC	Luke	8	40	Now when Jesus came back [ to Galilee ] , the crowd received and welcomed Him gladly , for they were all waiting and looking for Him .
AMPC	Luke	8	41	And there came a man named Jairus , who had [ for a [ l ] long time ] been a director of the synagogue ; and falling at the feet of Jesus , he begged Him to come to his house ,
AMPC	Luke	8	42	For he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . As [ Jesus ] went , the people pressed together around Him [ almost suffocating Him ] .
AMPC	Luke	8	43	And a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years [ m ] and had spent all her living upon physicians , and could not be healed by anyone ,
AMPC	Luke	8	44	Came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment , and immediately her flow of blood ceased .
AMPC	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , Who is it who touched Me ? When all were denying it , Peter [ n ] and those who were with him said , Master , the multitudes surround You and press You on every side !
AMPC	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , Someone did touch Me ; for I perceived that [ healing ] power has gone forth from Me .
AMPC	Luke	8	47	And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice , she came up trembling , and , falling down before Him , she declared in the presence of all the people for what reason she had touched Him and how she had been instantly cured .
AMPC	Luke	8	48	And He said to her , Daughter , your faith ( your confidence and trust in Me ) has made you well ! Go ( enter ) [ o ] into peace ( [ p ] untroubled , undisturbed well-being ) .
AMPC	Luke	8	49	While He was still speaking , a man from the house of the director of the synagogue came and said [ to Jairus ] , Your daughter is dead ; do not [ q ] weary and trouble the Teacher any further .
AMPC	Luke	8	50	But Jesus , on hearing this , answered him , Do not be seized with alarm or struck with fear ; simply believe [ [ r ] in Me as able to do this ] , and she shall be made well .
AMPC	Luke	8	51	And when He came to the house , He permitted no one to enter with Him except Peter and John and James , and the girl ’ s father and mother .
AMPC	Luke	8	52	And all were weeping for and bewailing her ; but He said , Do not weep , for she is not dead but sleeping .
AMPC	Luke	8	53	And they laughed Him to scorn , knowing full well that she was dead .
AMPC	Luke	8	54	And grasping her hand , He called , saying , Child , arise [ [ s ] from the sleep of death ] !
AMPC	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned [ [ t ] from death ] , and she arose immediately ; and He directed that she should be given something to eat .
AMPC	Luke	8	56	And her parents were amazed , but He charged them to tell no one what had occurred .

AMPC	Luke	9	9	But Herod said , John I beheaded ; but Who is this about Whom I [ learn ] such things by hearsay ? And he sought to see Him .
AMPC	Luke	9	2	And He sent them out to announce and preach the kingdom of God and to bring healing .
AMPC	Luke	9	3	And He said to them , Do not take anything for your journey—neither walking stick , nor [ a ] wallet [ for a collection bag ] , nor food of any kind , nor money , and do not have two undergarments ( tunics ) .
AMPC	Luke	9	4	And whatever house you enter , stay there until you go away [ from that place ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	5	And wherever they do not receive and accept and welcome you , when you leave that town shake off [ even ] the dust from your feet , as a testimony against them .
AMPC	Luke	9	6	And departing , they went about from village to village , preaching the Gospel and restoring the afflicted to health everywhere .
AMPC	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was being done by [ Jesus ] , and he was [ thoroughly ] perplexed and troubled , because it was said by some that John [ the Baptist ] had been raised from the dead ,
AMPC	Luke	9	8	And by others that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the prophets of old had come back to life .
AMPC	Luke	9	10	Upon their return , the apostles reported to Jesus all that they had done . And He took them [ along with Him ] and withdrew into privacy near a town called Bethsaida .
AMPC	Luke	9	11	But when the crowds learned of it , [ they ] followed Him ; and He welcomed them and talked to them about the kingdom of God , and healed those who needed restoration to health .
AMPC	Luke	9	12	Now the day began to decline , and the Twelve came and said to Him , Dismiss the crowds and send them away , so that they may go to the neighboring hamlets and villages and the surrounding country and find lodging and get a [ b ] supply of provisions , for we are here in an uninhabited ( barren , solitary ) place .
AMPC	Luke	9	13	But He said to them , You [ yourselves ] give them [ food ] to eat . They said , We have no more than five loaves and two fish—unless we are to go and buy food for all this crowd , ( A )
AMPC	Luke	9	14	For there were about 5,000 men . And [ Jesus ] said to His disciples , Have them [ sit down ] reclining in table groups ( companies ) of about fifty each .
AMPC	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all recline .
AMPC	Luke	9	16	And taking the five loaves and the two fish , He looked up to heaven and [ praising God ] gave thanks and asked Him to bless them [ to their use ] . Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples to place before the multitude .
AMPC	Luke	9	17	And all the people ate and were satisfied . And they gathered up what remained over—twelve [ [ c ] small hand ] baskets of broken pieces .
AMPC	Luke	9	18	Now it occurred that as Jesus was praying privately , the disciples were with Him , and He asked them , Who do men say that I am ?
AMPC	Luke	9	19	And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elijah ; and others , that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life .
AMPC	Luke	9	20	And He said to them , But who do you [ yourselves ] say that I am ? And Peter replied , The Christ of God !
AMPC	Luke	9	21	But He strictly charged and sharply commanded them [ [ d ] under penalty ] to tell this to no one [ no one , [ e ] whoever he might be ] ,
AMPC	Luke	9	22	Saying , The Son of Man must suffer many things and be [ [ f ] deliberately ] disapproved and repudiated and rejected on the part of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be put to death and on the third day be raised [ again ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	23	And He said to all , If any person wills to come after Me , let him deny himself [ [ g ] disown himself , [ h ] forget , lose sight of himself and his own interests , [ i ] refuse and give up himself ] and take up his cross daily and follow Me [ [ j ] cleave steadfastly to Me , conform wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying also ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	24	For whoever would preserve his life and save it will lose and destroy it , but whoever loses his life for My sake , he will preserve and save it [ [ k ] from the penalty of eternal death ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	25	For what does it profit a man , if he gains the whole world and ruins or forfeits ( loses ) himself ?
AMPC	Luke	9	26	Because whoever is ashamed of Me and of My teachings , of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in the [ [ l ] threefold ] glory ( the splendor and majesty ) of Himself and of the Father and of the holy angels .
AMPC	Luke	9	27	However I tell you truly , there are some of those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	9	28	Now about eight days after these teachings , Jesus took with Him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray .
AMPC	Luke	9	29	And as He was praying , the appearance of His countenance became altered ( different ) , and His raiment became dazzling white [ [ m ] flashing with the brilliance of lightning ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men were conversing with Him—Moses and Elijah ,
AMPC	Luke	9	31	Who appeared in splendor and majesty and brightness and were speaking of His exit [ from life ] , which He was about to bring to realization at Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep , but when they fully awoke , they saw His glory ( splendor and majesty and brightness ) and the two men who stood with Him .
AMPC	Luke	9	33	And it occurred as the men were parting from Him that Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is delightful and good that we are here ; and let us construct three booths or huts—one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah ! not noticing or knowing what he was saying .
AMPC	Luke	9	34	But even as he was saying this , a cloud came and began to overshadow them , and they were seized with alarm and struck with fear as they entered into the cloud .
AMPC	Luke	9	35	Then there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is My Son , My Chosen One or [ n ] My Beloved ; listen to and yield to and obey Him !
AMPC	Luke	9	36	And when the voice had died away , Jesus was found there alone . And they kept still , and told no one at that time any of these things that they had seen .
AMPC	Luke	9	37	Now it occurred the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met Him .
AMPC	Luke	9	38	And behold , a man from the crowd shouted out , Master , I implore You to look at my son , for he is my only child ;
AMPC	Luke	9	39	And behold , a spirit seizes him and suddenly he cries out ; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth ; and he is sorely shattered , and it will scarcely leave him .
AMPC	Luke	9	40	And I implored Your disciples to drive it out , but they could not .
AMPC	Luke	9	41	Jesus answered , O [ faithless ones ] unbelieving and without trust in God , a perverse ( [ o ] wayward , [ p ] crooked and [ q ] warped ) generation ! Until when and how long am I to be with you and bear with you ? Bring your son here [ to Me ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	42	And even while he was coming , the demon threw him down and [ completely ] convulsed him . But Jesus censured and severely rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and restored him to his father .
AMPC	Luke	9	43	And all were astounded at the evidence of God ’ s mighty power and His majesty and magnificence . But [ while ] they were all marveling at everything Jesus was doing , He said to His disciples ,
AMPC	Luke	9	44	Let these words sink into your ears : the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men [ [ r ] whose conduct is opposed to God ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	45	However , they did not comprehend this saying ; and it was kept hidden from them , so that they should not grasp it and understand , and they were afraid to ask Him about the statement .
AMPC	Luke	9	46	But a controversy arose among them as to which of them might be the greatest [ surpassing the others in excellence , worth , and authority ] .
AMPC	Luke	9	47	But Jesus , as He perceived the thoughts of their hearts , took a little child and put him at His side
AMPC	Luke	9	48	And told them , Whoever receives and accepts and welcomes this child in My name and for My sake receives and accepts and welcomes Me ; and whoever so receives Me so also receives Him Who sent Me . For he who is least and lowliest among you all—he is [ the one who is truly ] great .
AMPC	Luke	9	49	John said , Master , we saw a man driving out demons in Your name and we commanded him to stop it , for he does not follow along with us .
AMPC	Luke	9	50	But Jesus told him , Do not forbid [ such people ] ; for whoever is not against you is for you .
AMPC	Luke	9	51	Now when the time was almost come for Jesus to be received up [ to heaven ] , He steadfastly and determinedly set His face to go to Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	9	52	And He sent messengers before Him ; and they reached and entered a Samaritan village to make [ things ] ready for Him ;
AMPC	Luke	9	53	But [ the people ] would not welcome or receive or accept Him , because His face was [ set as if He was ] going to Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	9	54	And when His disciples James and John observed this , they said , Lord , do You wish us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them , [ s ] even as Elijah did ? ( B )

AMPC	Luke	9	58	And Jesus told him , Foxes have lurking holes and the birds of the air have roosts and nests , but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head .
AMPC	Luke	9	59	And He said to another , [ v ] Become My disciple , side with My party , and accompany Me ! But he replied , Lord , permit me first to go and bury ( [ w ] await the death of ) my father .
AMPC	Luke	9	60	But Jesus said to him , Allow the dead to bury their own dead ; but as for you , go and publish abroad [ x ] throughout all regions the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	9	61	Another also said , I will follow You , Lord , and become Your disciple and side with Your party ; but let me first say good-bye to those at my home .
AMPC	Luke	9	62	Jesus said to him , No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back [ to the things behind ] is fit for the kingdom of God .

AMPC	Luke	10	10	But whenever you go into a town and they do not receive and accept and welcome you , go out into its streets and say ,
AMPC	Luke	10	2	And He said to them , The harvest indeed is abundant [ [ a ] there is much ripe grain ] , but the farmhands are few . Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest .
AMPC	Luke	10	3	Go your way ; behold , I send you out like lambs into the midst of wolves .
AMPC	Luke	10	4	Carry no purse , no provisions bag , no [ change of ] sandals ; refrain from [ retarding your journey by ] saluting and wishing anyone well along the way .
AMPC	Luke	10	5	Whatever house you enter , first say , Peace be to this household ! [ [ b ] Freedom from all the distresses that result from sin be with this family ] .
AMPC	Luke	10	6	And if anyone [ worthy ] of peace and blessedness is there , the peace and blessedness you wish shall come upon him ; but if not , it shall come back to you .
AMPC	Luke	10	7	And stay on in the same house , eating and drinking what they provide , for the laborer is worthy of his wages . Do not keep moving from house to house . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	10	8	Whenever you go into a town and they receive and accept and welcome you , eat what is set before you ;
AMPC	Luke	10	9	And heal the sick in it and say to them , The kingdom of God has come close to you .
AMPC	Luke	10	11	Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we are wiping off against you ; yet know and understand this : the kingdom of God has come near you .
AMPC	Luke	10	12	I tell you , it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that town . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	10	13	Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
AMPC	Luke	10	14	However , it shall be more tolerable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
AMPC	Luke	10	15	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted unto heaven ? You shall be brought down to Hades ( the regions of the dead ) .
AMPC	Luke	10	16	He who hears and heeds you [ disciples ] hears and heeds Me ; and he who slights and rejects you slights and rejects Me ; and he who slights and rejects Me slights and rejects Him who sent Me .
AMPC	Luke	10	17	The seventy returned with joy , saying , Lord , even the demons are subject to us in Your name !
AMPC	Luke	10	18	And He said to them , I saw Satan falling like a lightning [ flash ] from heaven .
AMPC	Luke	10	19	Behold ! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions , and [ physical and mental strength and ability ] over all the power that the enemy [ possesses ] ; and nothing shall in any way harm you .
AMPC	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , do not rejoice at this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	10	21	In that same hour He rejoiced and gloried in the Holy Spirit and said , I thank You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have concealed these things [ relating to salvation ] from the wise and understanding and learned , and revealed them to babes ( the childish , unskilled , and untaught ) . Yes , Father , for such was Your gracious [ c ] will and choice and good pleasure .
AMPC	Luke	10	22	All things have been given over into My power by My Father ; and no one knows Who the Son is except the Father , or Who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son may choose to reveal and make Him known .
AMPC	Luke	10	23	Then turning to His disciples , He said privately , Blessed ( happy , [ d ] to be envied ) are those whose eyes see what you see !
AMPC	Luke	10	24	For I tell you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see and they did not see it , and to hear what you hear and they did not hear it .
AMPC	Luke	10	25	And then a certain lawyer arose to try ( test , tempt ) Him , saying , Teacher , what am I to do to inherit everlasting life [ that is , to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah ’ s kingdom ] ?
AMPC	Luke	10	26	Jesus said to him , What is written in the Law ? How do you read it ?
AMPC	Luke	10	27	And he replied , You must love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	10	28	And Jesus said to him , You have answered correctly ; do this , and you will live [ enjoy active , blessed , endless life in the kingdom of God ] .
AMPC	Luke	10	29	And he , [ e ] determined to acquit himself of reproach , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbor ?
AMPC	Luke	10	30	Jesus , [ f ] taking him up , replied , A certain man was going from Jerusalem down to Jericho , and he fell among robbers , who stripped him of his clothes and belongings and beat him and went their way , [ [ g ] unconcernedly ] leaving him half dead , as it happened .
AMPC	Luke	10	31	Now by [ h ] coincidence a certain priest was going down along that road , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
AMPC	Luke	10	32	A Levite likewise came down to the place and saw him , and passed by on the other side [ of the road ] .
AMPC	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan , as he traveled along , came down to where he was ; and when he saw him , he was moved with pity and sympathy [ for him ] ,
AMPC	Luke	10	34	And went to him and dressed his wounds , pouring on [ them ] oil and wine . Then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
AMPC	Luke	10	35	And the next day he took out two denarii [ two day ’ s wages ] and gave [ them ] to the innkeeper , saying , Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , I [ myself ] will repay you when I return .
AMPC	Luke	10	36	Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers ?
AMPC	Luke	10	37	He answered , The one who showed pity and mercy to him . And Jesus said to him , Go and do likewise .
AMPC	Luke	10	38	Now while they were on their way , it occurred that Jesus entered a certain village , and a woman named Martha received and welcomed Him into her house .
AMPC	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister named Mary , who seated herself at the Lord ’ s feet and was listening to His teaching .
AMPC	Luke	10	40	But Martha [ overly occupied and too busy ] was distracted with much serving ; and she came up to Him and said , Lord , is it nothing to You that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Tell her then to help me [ to lend a hand and do her part along with me ] !
AMPC	Luke	10	41	But the Lord replied to her by saying , Martha , Martha , you are anxious and troubled about many things ;
AMPC	Luke	10	42	There is need of only one or but [ i ] a few things . Mary has chosen the good portion [ [ j ] that which is to her advantage ] , which shall not be taken away from her .

AMPC	Luke	11	2	And He said to them , When you pray , say : Our Father Who is in heaven , hallowed be Your name , Your kingdom come . Your will be done [ held holy and revered ] on earth as it is in heaven .
AMPC	Luke	11	3	Give us daily our bread [ [ a ] food for the morrow ] .
AMPC	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us [ who has offended us or done us wrong ] . And bring us not into temptation but rescue us from evil .
AMPC	Luke	11	5	And He said to them , Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and will say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves [ of bread ] ,
AMPC	Luke	11	6	For a friend of mine who is on a journey has just come , and I have nothing to put before him ;
AMPC	Luke	11	7	And he from within will answer , Do not disturb me ; the door is now closed , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not get up and supply you [ with anything ] ?
AMPC	Luke	11	8	I tell you , although he will not get up and supply him anything because he is his friend , yet because of his shameless persistence and insistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs .
AMPC	Luke	11	9	So I say to you , Ask and [ b ] keep on asking and it shall be given you ; seek and [ c ] keep on seeking and you shall find ; knock and [ d ] keep on knocking and the door shall be opened to you .
AMPC	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks and [ e ] keeps on asking receives ; and he who seeks and [ f ] keeps on seeking finds ; and to him who knocks and [ g ] keeps on knocking , the door shall be opened .
AMPC	Luke	11	12	Or if he asks for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
AMPC	Luke	11	13	If you then , evil as you are , know how to give good gifts [ gifts [ i ] that are to their advantage ] to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and [ j ] continue to ask Him !
AMPC	Luke	11	14	Now Jesus was driving out a demon that was dumb ; and it occurred that when the demon had gone out , the dumb man spoke . And the crowds marveled .
AMPC	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , He drives out demons [ because He is in league with and ] by Beelzebub , the prince of demons ,
AMPC	Luke	11	16	While others , to try and test and tempt Him , demanded a sign of Him from heaven .
AMPC	Luke	11	17	But He , [ well ] aware of their intent and purpose , said to them , Every kingdom split up against itself is doomed and brought to desolation , and so house falls upon house . [ The disunited household will collapse . ]
AMPC	Luke	11	18	And if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom last ? For you say that I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub .
AMPC	Luke	11	19	Now if I expel demons with the help of and by Beelzebub , with whose help and by whom do your sons drive them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
AMPC	Luke	11	20	But if I drive out the demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has [ already ] come upon you .
AMPC	Luke	11	21	When the strong man , fully armed , [ [ k ] from his courtyard ] guards his own dwelling , his belongings are undisturbed [ his property is at peace and is secure ] .
AMPC	Luke	11	22	But when one stronger than he attacks him and conquers him , he robs him of his whole armor on which he had relied and divides up and distributes all his goods as plunder ( spoil ) .
AMPC	Luke	11	23	He who is not with Me [ siding and believing with Me ] is against Me , and he who does not gather with Me [ engage in My interest ] , scatters .
AMPC	Luke	11	24	When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it roams through waterless places in search [ of a place ] of rest ( release , refreshment , ease ) ; and finding none it says , I will go back to my house from which I came .
AMPC	Luke	11	25	And when it arrives , it finds [ the place ] swept and put in order and furnished and decorated .
AMPC	Luke	11	26	And it goes and brings other spirits , seven [ of them ] , more evil than itself , and they enter in , settle down , and dwell there ; and the last state of that person is worse than the first .
AMPC	Luke	11	27	Now it occurred that as He was saying these things , a certain woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him , Blessed ( happy and [ l ] to be envied ) is the womb that bore You and the breasts that You sucked !
AMPC	Luke	11	28	But He said , Blessed ( happy and [ m ] to be envied ) rather are those who hear the Word of God and obey and practice it !
AMPC	Luke	11	29	Now as the crowds were [ increasingly ] thronging Him , He began to say , This present generation is a wicked one ; it seeks and demands a sign ( miracle ) , but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of Jonah [ the prophet ] . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	11	30	For [ just ] as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh , so will also the Son of Man be [ a sign ] to this age and generation . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	11	31	The queen of the South will arise in the judgment with the people of this age and generation and condemn them ; for she came from the ends of the [ inhabited ] earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon , and notice , [ n ] here is more than Solomon . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineveh will appear as witnesses at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it ; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and behold , [ o ] here is more than Jonah . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	11	33	No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or crypt or under a bushel measure , but on a lampstand , that those who are coming in may see the light .
AMPC	Luke	11	34	Your eye is the lamp of your body ; when your eye ( [ p ] your conscience ) is sound and fulfilling its office , your whole body is full of light ; but when it is not sound and is not fulfilling its office , your body is full of darkness .
AMPC	Luke	11	35	Be careful , therefore , that the light that is in you is not darkness .
AMPC	Luke	11	36	If then your entire body is illuminated , having no part dark , it will be wholly bright [ with light ] , as when a lamp with its bright rays gives you light .
AMPC	Luke	11	37	Now while Jesus was speaking , a Pharisee invited Him to take dinner with him , so He entered and reclined at table .
AMPC	Luke	11	38	The Pharisee noticed and was astonished [ to see ] that Jesus did not first wash before dinner .
AMPC	Luke	11	39	But the Lord said to him , Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate , but inside you yourselves are full of greed and robbery and extortion and malice and wickedness .
AMPC	Luke	11	40	You senseless ( foolish , stupid ) ones [ acting without reflection or intelligence ] ! Did not He Who made the outside make the inside also ?
AMPC	Luke	11	41	But [ dedicate your inner self and ] give as donations to the poor of those things which are within [ of inward righteousness ] and behold , everything is purified and clean for you .
AMPC	Luke	11	42	But woe to you , Pharisees ! For you tithe mint and rue and every [ little ] herb , but disregard and neglect justice and the love of God . These you ought to have done without leaving the others undone . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	11	43	Woe to you , Pharisees ! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and [ you love ] to be greeted and bowed down to in the [ public ] marketplaces .
AMPC	Luke	11	44	Woe to you ! For you are like graves which are not marked or seen , and men walk over them without being aware of it [ and are ceremonially defiled ] .
AMPC	Luke	11	45	One of the experts in the [ Mosaic ] Law answered Him , Teacher , in saying this , You reproach and outrage and affront even us !
AMPC	Luke	11	46	But He said , Woe to you , the lawyers , also ! For you load men with oppressive burdens hard to bear , and you do not personally [ even [ q ] gently ] touch the burdens with one of your fingers .
AMPC	Luke	11	47	Woe to you ! For you are [ r ] rebuilding and repairing the tombs of the prophets , whom your fathers killed ( destroyed ) .
AMPC	Luke	11	48	So you bear witness and give your full approval and consent to the deeds of your fathers ; for they actually killed them , and you rebuild and repair monuments to them .
AMPC	Luke	11	49	For this reason also the wisdom of God said , I will send them prophets and apostles , [ some ] of whom they will put to death and persecute ,
AMPC	Luke	11	50	So that the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world may be charged against and required of this age and generation ,
AMPC	Luke	11	51	From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , it shall be charged against and required of this age and generation . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	11	52	Woe to you , lawyers ( experts in the Mosaic Law ) ! For you have taken away the key to knowledge ; you did not go in yourselves , and you hindered and prevented those who were entering .
AMPC	Luke	11	53	As He left there , the scribes and the Pharisees [ followed Him closely , and they ] began [ s ] to be enraged with and set themselves violently against Him and to draw Him out and provoke Him to speak of many things ,
AMPC	Luke	11	54	Secretly watching and plotting and lying in wait for Him , to seize upon something He might say [ that they might accuse Him ] .

AMPC	Luke	12	12	For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour and [ b ] moment what [ you ] ought to say .
AMPC	Luke	12	2	Nothing is [ so closely ] covered up that it will not be revealed , or hidden that it will not be known .
AMPC	Luke	12	3	Whatever you have spoken in the darkness shall be heard and listened to in the light , and what you have whispered in [ people ’ s ] ears and behind closed doors will be proclaimed upon the housetops .
AMPC	Luke	12	4	I tell you , My friends , do not dread and be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have nothing more that they can do .
AMPC	Luke	12	5	But I will warn you whom you should fear : fear Him Who , after killing , has power to hurl into hell ( Gehenna ) ; yes , I say to you , fear Him !
AMPC	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? And [ yet ] not one of them is forgotten or uncared for in the presence of God .
AMPC	Luke	12	7	But [ even ] the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Do not be struck with fear or seized with alarm ; you are of greater worth than many [ flocks ] of sparrows .
AMPC	Luke	12	8	And I tell you , Whoever declares openly [ speaking out freely ] and confesses that he is My worshiper and acknowledges Me before men , the Son of Man also will declare and confess and acknowledge him before the angels of God .
AMPC	Luke	12	9	But he who disowns and denies and rejects and refuses to acknowledge Me before men will be disowned and denied and rejected and refused acknowledgement in the presence of the angels of God .
AMPC	Luke	12	10	And everyone who makes a statement or speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [ that is , whoever [ a ] intentionally comes short of the reverence due the Holy Spirit ] , it will not be forgiven him [ for him there is no forgiveness ] .
AMPC	Luke	12	11	And when they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities , do not be anxious [ beforehand ] how you shall reply in defense or what you are to say .
AMPC	Luke	12	13	Someone from the crowd said to Him , Master , order my brother to divide the inheritance and share it with me .
AMPC	Luke	12	14	But He told him , Man , who has appointed Me a judge or umpire and divider over you ?
AMPC	Luke	12	15	And He said to them , Guard yourselves and keep free from all covetousness ( the immoderate desire for wealth , the greedy longing to have more ) ; for a man ’ s life does not consist in and is not derived from possessing [ c ] overflowing abundance or that which is [ d ] over and above his needs .
AMPC	Luke	12	16	Then He told them a parable , saying , The land of a rich man was fertile and yielded plentifully .
AMPC	Luke	12	17	And he considered and debated within himself , What shall I do ? I have no place [ in which ] to gather together my harvest .
AMPC	Luke	12	18	And he said , I will do this : I will pull down my storehouses and build larger ones , and there I will store all [ e ] my grain or produce and my goods .
AMPC	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , Soul , you have many good things laid up , [ enough ] for many years . Take your ease ; eat , drink , and enjoy yourself merrily .
AMPC	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , You fool ! This very night [ f ] they [ the messengers of God ] will demand your soul of you ; and all the things that you have prepared , whose will they be ? ( A )
AMPC	Luke	12	21	So it is with the one who continues to lay up and hoard possessions for himself and is not rich [ in his relation ] to God [ this is how he fares ] .
AMPC	Luke	12	22	And [ Jesus ] said to His disciples , Therefore I tell you , do not be anxious and troubled [ with cares ] about your life , as to what you will [ have to ] eat ; or about your body , as to what you will [ have to ] wear .
AMPC	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body [ more ] than clothes .
AMPC	Luke	12	24	Observe and consider the ravens ; for they neither sow nor reap , they have neither storehouse nor barn ; and [ yet ] God feeds them . Of how much more worth are you than the birds !
AMPC	Luke	12	25	And which of you by being overly anxious and troubled with cares can add a [ g ] cubit to his stature or a moment [ unit ] of time to his [ h ] age [ the length of his life ] ?
AMPC	Luke	12	26	If then you are not able to do such a little thing as that , why are you anxious and troubled with cares about the rest ?
AMPC	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow . They neither [ wearily ] toil nor spin nor [ i ] weave ; yet I tell you , even Solomon in all his glory ( his splendor and magnificence ) was not arrayed like one of these . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	12	28	But if God so clothes the grass in the field , which is alive today , and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more will He clothe you , O you [ people ] of little faith ?
AMPC	Luke	12	29	And you , do not seek [ by meditating and reasoning to inquire into ] what you are to eat and what you are to drink ; nor be of anxious ( troubled ) mind [ [ j ] unsettled , excited , worried , and [ k ] in suspense ] ;
AMPC	Luke	12	30	For all the pagan world is [ greedily ] seeking these things , and your Father knows that you need them .
AMPC	Luke	12	31	Only aim at and strive for and seek His kingdom , and all these things shall be supplied to you also .
AMPC	Luke	12	32	Do not be seized with alarm and struck with fear , little flock , for it is your Father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom !
AMPC	Luke	12	33	Sell what you possess and give donations to the poor ; provide yourselves with purses and handbags that do not grow old , an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens , where no thief comes near and no moth destroys .
AMPC	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
AMPC	Luke	12	35	Keep your loins girded and your lamps burning ,
AMPC	Luke	12	36	And be like men who are waiting for their master to return home from the marriage feast , so that when he returns from the wedding and comes and knocks , they may open to him immediately .
AMPC	Luke	12	37	Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ l ] to be envied ) are those servants whom the master finds awake and alert and watching when he comes . Truly I say to you , he will gird himself and have them recline at table and will come and serve them !
AMPC	Luke	12	38	If he comes in the second watch ( before midnight ) or the third watch ( after midnight ) , and finds them so , blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ m ] to be envied ) are those servants !
AMPC	Luke	12	39	But of this be assured : if the householder had known at what time the burglar was coming , he would have been awake and alert and watching and would not have permitted his house to be dug through and broken into .
AMPC	Luke	12	40	You also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour and a [ n ] moment when you do not anticipate it .
AMPC	Luke	12	41	Peter said , Lord , are You telling this parable for us , or for all alike ?
AMPC	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful steward , the wise man whom his master will set over those in his household service to supply them their allowance of food at the appointed time ?
AMPC	Luke	12	43	Blessed ( happy and [ o ] to be envied ) is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he arrives .
AMPC	Luke	12	44	Truly I tell you , he will set him in charge over all his possessions .
AMPC	Luke	12	45	But if that servant says in his heart , My master is late in coming , and begins to strike the menservants and the maids and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
AMPC	Luke	12	46	The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour of which he does not know , and will punish him and cut him off and assign his lot with [ p ] the unfaithful .
AMPC	Luke	12	47	And that servant who knew his master ’ s will but did not get ready or act as he would wish him to act shall be beaten with many [ lashes ] .
AMPC	Luke	12	48	But he who did not know and did things worthy of a beating shall be beaten with few [ lashes ] . For everyone to whom much is given , of him shall much be required ; and of him to whom men entrust much , they will require and demand all the more . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	12	49	I have come to cast fire upon the earth , and how I wish that it were already kindled !
AMPC	Luke	12	50	I have a baptism with which to be baptized , and how greatly and sorely I am urged on ( impelled , [ q ] constrained ) until it is accomplished !
AMPC	Luke	12	51	Do you suppose that I have come to give peace upon earth ? No , I say to you , but rather division ;
AMPC	Luke	12	52	For from now on in one house there will be five divided [ among themselves ] , three against two and two against three .
AMPC	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	12	54	He also said to the crowds of people , When you see a cloud rising in the west , at once you say , It is going to rain ! And so it does .
AMPC	Luke	12	55	And when [ you see that ] a south wind is blowing , you say , There will be severe heat ! And it occurs .
AMPC	Luke	12	56	You playactors ( hypocrites ) ! You know how [ intelligently ] to discern and interpret and [ r ] prove the looks of the earth and sky ; but how is it that you do not know how to discern and interpret and apply the proof to this present time ?
AMPC	Luke	12	57	And why do you not judge what is just and personally decide what is right ?
AMPC	Luke	12	58	Then as you go with your accuser before a magistrate , on the way make a diligent effort to settle and be quit ( free ) of him , lest he drag you to the judge , and the judge turn you over to the officer , and the officer put you in prison .
AMPC	Luke	12	59	I tell you , you will never get out until you have paid the very last [ fraction of a ] cent .

AMPC	Luke	13	13	Then He laid [ His ] hands on her , and instantly she was made straight , and she [ j ] recognized and thanked and praised God .
AMPC	Luke	13	2	And He replied by saying to them , Do you think that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans because they have suffered in this way ?
AMPC	Luke	13	3	I tell you , No ; but unless you repent ( [ a ] change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ) , you will all likewise perish and be lost [ b ] eternally .
AMPC	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them—do you think that they were more guilty offenders ( debtors ) than all the others who dwelt in Jerusalem ?
AMPC	Luke	13	5	I tell you , No ; but unless you repent ( [ c ] change your mind for the better and heartily amend your ways , with abhorrence of your past sins ) , you will all likewise perish and be lost [ d ] eternally .
AMPC	Luke	13	6	And He told them this parable : A certain man had a fig tree , planted in his vineyard , and he came looking for fruit on it , but did not find [ any ] .
AMPC	Luke	13	7	So he said to the vinedresser , See here ! For these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and I find none . Cut it down ! Why should it continue also to use up the ground [ to [ e ] deplete the soil , intercept the sun , and take up room ] ?
AMPC	Luke	13	8	But he replied to him , Leave it alone , sir , [ just ] this one more year , till I dig around it and put manure [ on the soil ] .
AMPC	Luke	13	9	Then perhaps it will bear fruit after this ; but if not , you can cut it down and out .
AMPC	Luke	13	10	Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
AMPC	Luke	13	11	And there was a woman there who for eighteen years had had an [ f ] infirmity caused by a spirit ( [ g ] a demon of sickness ) . She was [ h ] bent completely forward and utterly unable to straighten herself up or to [ i ] look upward .
AMPC	Luke	13	12	And when Jesus saw her , He called [ her to Him ] and said to her , Woman , you are released from your infirmity !
AMPC	Luke	13	14	But the [ k ] leader of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the crowd , There are six days on which work ought to be done ; so come on those days and be cured , and not on the Sabbath day . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	13	15	But the Lord replied to him , saying , You playactors ( hypocrites ) ! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it out to water it ?
AMPC	Luke	13	16	And ought not this woman , a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day ?
AMPC	Luke	13	17	Even as He said this , all His opponents were put to shame , and all the people were rejoicing over all the glorious things that were being done by Him .
AMPC	Luke	13	18	This led Him to say , What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ?
AMPC	Luke	13	19	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his own garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and the wild birds [ l ] found shelter and roosted and nested in its branches .
AMPC	Luke	13	20	And again He said , To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
AMPC	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of wheat flour or meal until it was all leavened ( fermented ) .
AMPC	Luke	13	22	[ Jesus ] journeyed on through towns and villages , teaching , and making His way toward Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	13	23	And someone asked Him , Lord , will only a few be saved ( rescued , delivered from the penalties of the last judgment , and made partakers of the salvation by Christ ) ? And He said to them ,
AMPC	Luke	13	24	Strive to enter by the narrow door [ force yourselves through it ] , for many , I tell you , will try to enter and will not be able .
AMPC	Luke	13	25	When once the Master of the house gets up and closes the door , and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door [ again and again ] , saying , Lord , open to us ! He will answer you , I do not know where [ [ m ] what household—certainly not Mine ] you come from .
AMPC	Luke	13	26	Then you will begin to say , We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets .
AMPC	Luke	13	27	But He will say , I tell you , I do not know where [ [ n ] what household—certainly not Mine ] you come from ; depart from Me , all you wrongdoers !
AMPC	Luke	13	28	There will be weeping and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but you yourselves being cast forth ( banished , driven away ) .
AMPC	Luke	13	29	And [ people ] will come from east and west , and from north and south , and sit down ( feast at table ) in the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	13	30	And behold , there are some [ now ] last who will be first [ then ] , and there are some [ now ] first who will be last [ then ] .
AMPC	Luke	13	31	At that very hour some Pharisees came up and said to Him , Go away from here , for Herod is determined to kill You .
AMPC	Luke	13	32	And He said to them , Go and tell that fox [ sly and crafty , skulking and cowardly ] , Behold , I drive out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I finish ( complete ) My course .
AMPC	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless , I must continue on My way today and tomorrow and the day after that—for it will never do for a prophet to be destroyed away from Jerusalem !
AMPC	Luke	13	34	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who continue to kill the prophets and to stone those who are sent to you ! How often I have desired and yearned to gather your children together [ around Me ] , as a hen [ gathers ] her young under her wings , but you would not !
AMPC	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house is forsaken ( abandoned , left to you destitute of God ’ s help ) ! And I tell you , you will not see Me again until the time comes when you shall say , Blessed ( to be celebrated with praises ) is He Who comes in the name of the Lord !

AMPC	Luke	14	14	Then you will be blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ c ] to be envied ) , because they have no way of repaying you , and you will be recompensed at the resurrection of the just ( upright ) .
AMPC	Luke	14	2	And behold , [ just ] in front of Him there was a man who had dropsy .
AMPC	Luke	14	3	And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees , Is it lawful and right to cure on the Sabbath or not ?
AMPC	Luke	14	4	But they kept silent . Then He took hold [ of the man ] and cured him and [ a ] sent him away .
AMPC	Luke	14	5	And He said to them , Which of you , having a son [ b ] or a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a well , will not at once pull him out on the Sabbath day ?
AMPC	Luke	14	6	And they were unable to reply to this .
AMPC	Luke	14	7	Now He told a parable to those who were invited , [ when ] He noticed how they were selecting the places of honor , saying to them ,
AMPC	Luke	14	8	When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast , do not recline on the chief seat [ in the place of honor ] , lest a more distinguished person than you has been invited by him , ( A )
AMPC	Luke	14	9	And he who invited both of you will come to you and say , Let this man have the place [ you have taken ] . Then , with humiliation and a guilty sense of impropriety , you will begin to take the lowest place .
AMPC	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , go and recline in the lowest place , so that when your host comes in , he may say to you , Friend , go up higher ! Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit [ at table ] with you .
AMPC	Luke	14	11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled ( ranked below others who are honored or rewarded ) , and he who humbles himself ( keeps a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly ) will be exalted ( elevated in rank ) .
AMPC	Luke	14	12	Jesus also said to the man who had invited Him , When you give a dinner or a supper , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors , lest perhaps they also invite you in return , and so you are paid back .
AMPC	Luke	14	13	But when you give a banquet or a reception , invite the poor , the disabled , the lame , and the blind .
AMPC	Luke	14	15	When one of those who reclined [ at the table ] with Him heard this , he said to Him , Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ d ] to be envied ) is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God !
AMPC	Luke	14	16	But Jesus said to him , A man was once giving a great supper and invited many ;
AMPC	Luke	14	17	And at the hour for the supper he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited , Come , for all is now ready .
AMPC	Luke	14	18	But they all alike began to make excuses and to beg off . The first said to him , I have bought a piece of land , and I have to go out and see it ; I beg you , have me excused .
AMPC	Luke	14	19	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I am going to examine and [ e ] put my approval on them ; I beg you , have me excused .
AMPC	Luke	14	20	And another said , I have married a wife , and because of this I am unable to come . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	14	21	So the servant came and reported these [ answers ] to his master . Then the master of the house said in wrath to his servant , Go quickly into the [ f ] great streets and the small streets of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame .
AMPC	Luke	14	22	And the servant [ returning ] said , Sir , what you have commanded me to do has been done , and yet there is room .
AMPC	Luke	14	23	Then the master said to the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges and urge and constrain [ them ] to yield and come in , so that my house may be filled .
AMPC	Luke	14	24	For I tell you , not one of those who were invited shall taste my supper .
AMPC	Luke	14	25	Now huge crowds were going along with [ Jesus ] , and He turned and said to them ,
AMPC	Luke	14	26	If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his [ own ] father and mother [ [ g ] in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God ] and [ likewise ] his wife and children and brothers and sisters— [ yes ] and even his own life also—he can not be My disciple .
AMPC	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not persevere and carry his own cross and come after ( follow ) Me can not be My disciple .
AMPC	Luke	14	28	For which of you , wishing to build a [ h ] farm building , does not first sit down and calculate the cost [ to see ] whether he has sufficient means to finish it ?
AMPC	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , when he has laid the foundation and is unable to complete [ the building ] , all who see it will begin to mock and jeer at him ,
AMPC	Luke	14	30	Saying , This man began to build and was not able ( [ i ] worth enough ) to finish .
AMPC	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going out to engage in conflict with another king , will not first sit down and consider and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand [ men ] to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
AMPC	Luke	14	32	And if he can not [ do so ] , when the other king is still a great way off , he sends an envoy and asks the terms of peace .
AMPC	Luke	14	33	So then , any of you who does not forsake ( renounce , surrender claim to , give up , [ j ] say good-bye to ) all that he has can not be My disciple .
AMPC	Luke	14	34	Salt is good [ an excellent thing ] , but if salt has lost its strength and has become saltless ( insipid , flat ) , how shall its saltness be restored ?
AMPC	Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap ; men throw it away . He who has ears to hear , let him listen and consider and comprehend by hearing !

AMPC	Luke	15	15	So he went and forced ( glued ) himself upon one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to feed hogs .
AMPC	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering and indignantly complaining , saying , This man accepts and receives and welcomes [ [ b ] preeminently wicked ] sinners and eats with them .
AMPC	Luke	15	3	So He told them this parable :
AMPC	Luke	15	4	What man of you , if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness ( desert ) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it ?
AMPC	Luke	15	5	And when he has found it , he lays it on his [ own ] shoulders , rejoicing .
AMPC	Luke	15	6	And when he gets home , he summons together [ his ] friends and [ his ] neighbors , saying to them , Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep which was lost .
AMPC	Luke	15	7	Thus , I tell you , there will be more joy in heaven over one [ [ c ] especially ] wicked person who repents ( [ d ] changes his mind , abhorring his errors and misdeeds , and determines to enter upon a better course of life ) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance .
AMPC	Luke	15	8	Or what woman , having ten [ silver ] drachmas [ each one equal to a day ’ s wages ] , if she loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it ?
AMPC	Luke	15	9	And when she has found it , she summons her [ women ] friends and neighbors , saying , Rejoice with me , for I have found the silver coin which I had lost .
AMPC	Luke	15	10	Even so , I tell you , there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [ [ e ] especially ] wicked person who repents ( [ f ] changes his mind for the better , heartily amending his ways , with abhorrence of his past sins ) .
AMPC	Luke	15	11	And He said , There was a certain man who had two sons ;
AMPC	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the part of the property that falls [ to me ] . And he divided the estate between them . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	15	13	And not many days after that , the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country , and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [ from restraint ] living .
AMPC	Luke	15	14	And when he had spent all he had , a [ g ] mighty famine came upon that country , and he began to fall behind and be in want .
AMPC	Luke	15	16	And he would gladly have fed on and [ h ] filled his belly with the [ i ] carob pods that the hogs were eating , but [ they could not satisfy his hunger and ] nobody gave him anything [ better ] . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	15	17	Then when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father have enough food , and [ even food ] to spare , but I am perishing ( dying ) here of hunger !
AMPC	Luke	15	18	I will get up and go to my father , and I will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight .
AMPC	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; [ just ] make me like one of your hired servants .
AMPC	Luke	15	20	So he got up and came to his [ own ] father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [ for him ] ; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [ [ j ] fervently ] .
AMPC	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [ I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours ] !
AMPC	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his bond servants , Bring quickly the best robe ( the festive robe of honor ) and put it on him ; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	15	23	And bring out [ k ] that [ wheat- ] fattened calf and kill it ; and let us [ l ] revel and feast and be happy and make merry ,
AMPC	Luke	15	24	Because this my son was dead and is alive again ; he was lost and is found ! And they began to [ m ] revel and feast and make merry .
AMPC	Luke	15	25	But his older son was in the field ; and as he returned and came near the house , he heard music and dancing .
AMPC	Luke	15	26	And having called one of the servant [ boys ] to him , he began to ask what this meant .
AMPC	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , Your brother has come , and your father has killed [ n ] that [ wheat- ] fattened calf , because he has received him back safe and well .
AMPC	Luke	15	28	But [ the elder brother ] was angry [ with deep-seated wrath ] and resolved not to go in . Then his father came out and began to plead with him ,
AMPC	Luke	15	29	But he answered his father , Look ! These many years I have served you , and I have never disobeyed your command . Yet you never gave me [ so much as ] a [ little ] kid , that I might [ o ] revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends ;
AMPC	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours arrived , who has devoured your estate with immoral women , you have killed for him [ p ] that [ wheat- ] fattened calf !
AMPC	Luke	15	31	And the father said to him , Son , you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .
AMPC	Luke	15	32	But it was fitting to make merry , to [ q ] revel and feast and rejoice , for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again ! He was lost and is found !

AMPC	Luke	16	16	Until John came , there were the Law and the Prophets ; since then the good news ( the Gospel ) of the kingdom of God is being preached , and everyone strives violently to go in [ would force his [ l ] own way rather than God ’ s way into it ] .
AMPC	Luke	16	2	And he called him and said to him , What is this that I hear about you ? Turn in the account of your management [ of my affairs ] , for you can be [ my ] manager no longer .
AMPC	Luke	16	3	And the manager of the estate said to himself , What shall I do , seeing that my master is taking the management away from me ? I am not able to dig , and I am ashamed to beg .
AMPC	Luke	16	4	I have come to know what I will do , so that they [ my master ’ s debtors ] may accept and welcome me into their houses when I am put out of the management .
AMPC	Luke	16	5	So he summoned his master ’ s debtors one by one , and he said to the first , How much do you owe my master ?
AMPC	Luke	16	6	He said , A hundred measures [ about
AMPC	Luke	16	900	bushels ] of wheat . He said to him , Take back your written acknowledgement of [ c ] obligation , and write eighty [ about
AMPC	Luke	16	450	gallons ] .
AMPC	Luke	16	7	After that he said to another , And how much do you owe ? He said , A hundred measures [ about
AMPC	Luke	16	700	bushels ] .
AMPC	Luke	16	8	And [ his ] master praised the dishonest ( unjust ) manager for acting [ d ] shrewdly and [ e ] prudently ; for the sons of this age are shrewder and more prudent and wiser in [ [ f ] relation to ] their own generation [ to their own age and [ g ] kind ] than are the sons of light .
AMPC	Luke	16	9	And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon ( [ h ] deceitful riches , money , possessions ) , so that when it fails , they [ those you have favored ] may receive and welcome you into the everlasting habitations ( dwellings ) .
AMPC	Luke	16	10	He who is faithful in a very little [ thing ] is faithful also in much , and he who is dishonest and unjust in a very little [ thing ] is dishonest and unjust also in much .
AMPC	Luke	16	11	Therefore if you have not been faithful in the [ case of ] unrighteous mammon ( [ i ] deceitful riches , money , possessions ) , who will entrust to you the true riches ?
AMPC	Luke	16	12	And if you have not proved faithful in that which belongs to another [ whether God or man ] , who will give you that which is your own [ that is , [ j ] the true riches ] ?
AMPC	Luke	16	13	No servant is able to serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stand by and be devoted to the one and despise the other . You can not serve God and mammon ( riches , or [ k ] anything in which you trust and on which you rely ) .
AMPC	Luke	16	14	Now the Pharisees , who were covetous and lovers of money , heard all these things [ taken together ] , and they began to sneer at and ridicule and scoff at Him .
AMPC	Luke	16	15	But He said to them , You are the ones who declare yourselves just and upright before men , but God knows your hearts . For what is exalted and highly thought of among men is detestable and abhorrent ( an abomination ) in the sight of God . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	16	17	Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one dot of the Law to fail and become void .
AMPC	Luke	16	18	Whoever divorces ( dismisses and repudiates ) his wife and marries another commits adultery , and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery .
AMPC	Luke	16	19	There was a certain rich man who [ habitually ] clothed himself in purple and fine linen and [ m ] reveled and feasted and made merry in splendor every day .
AMPC	Luke	16	20	And at his gate there [ n ] was [ carelessly ] dropped down and left a certain [ o ] utterly destitute man named Lazarus , [ reduced to begging alms and ] covered with [ [ p ] ulcerated ] sores .
AMPC	Luke	16	21	He [ eagerly ] desired to be satisfied with what fell from the rich man ’ s table ; moreover , the dogs even came and licked his sores .
AMPC	Luke	16	22	And it occurred that the man [ reduced to ] begging died and was carried by the angels to Abraham ’ s bosom . The rich man also died and was buried .
AMPC	Luke	16	23	And in Hades ( the realm of the dead ) , being in torment , he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far away , and Lazarus in his bosom .
AMPC	Luke	16	24	And he cried out and said , Father Abraham , have pity and mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am in anguish in this flame .
AMPC	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , Child , remember that you in your lifetime fully received [ what is due you in ] comforts and delights , and Lazarus in like manner the discomforts and distresses ; but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish .
AMPC	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm has been fixed , in order that those who want to pass from this [ place ] to you may not be able , and no one may pass from there to us .
AMPC	Luke	16	27	And [ the man ] said , Then , father , I beseech you to send him to my father ’ s house—
AMPC	Luke	16	28	For I have five brothers—so that he may give [ solemn ] testimony and warn them , lest they too come into this place of torment .
AMPC	Luke	16	29	But Abraham said , They have Moses and the Prophets ; let them hear and listen to them .
AMPC	Luke	16	30	But he answered , No , father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent ( [ q ] change their minds for the better and heartily amend their ways , with abhorrence of their past sins ) .
AMPC	Luke	16	31	He said to him , If they do not hear and listen to Moses and the Prophets , neither will they be persuaded and convinced and believe [ even ] if someone should rise from the dead .

AMPC	Luke	17	17	Then Jesus asked , Were not [ all ] ten cleansed ? Where are the nine ?
AMPC	Luke	17	2	It would be more profitable for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were hurled into the sea than that he should cause to sin or be a snare to one of these little ones [ [ a ] lowly in rank or influence ] .
AMPC	Luke	17	3	[ b ] Pay attention and always be on your guard [ looking out for one another ] . If your brother sins ( misses the mark ) , solemnly tell him so and reprove him , and if he repents ( feels sorry for having sinned ) , forgive him .
AMPC	Luke	17	4	And even if he sins against you seven times in a day , and turns to you seven times and says , I repent [ I am sorry ] , you must forgive him ( give up resentment and consider the offense as recalled and annulled ) .
AMPC	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , Increase our faith ( that trust and confidence that spring from our belief in God ) .
AMPC	Luke	17	6	And the Lord answered , If you had faith ( trust and confidence in God ) even [ so small ] like a grain of mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , Be pulled up by the roots , and be planted in the sea , and it would obey you .
AMPC	Luke	17	7	Will any man of you who has a servant plowing or tending sheep say to him when he has come in from the field , Come at once and take your place at the table ?
AMPC	Luke	17	8	Will he not instead tell him , Get my supper ready and gird yourself and serve me while I eat and drink ; then afterward you yourself shall eat and drink ?
AMPC	Luke	17	9	Is he grateful and does he praise the servant because he did what he was ordered to do ?
AMPC	Luke	17	10	Even so on your part , when you have done everything that was assigned and commanded you , say , We are unworthy servants [ possessing no merit , for we have not gone beyond our obligation ] ; we have [ merely ] done what was our duty to do .
AMPC	Luke	17	11	As He went on His way to Jerusalem , it occurred that [ Jesus ] was passing [ along the border ] between Samaria and Galilee .
AMPC	Luke	17	12	And as He was going into one village , He was met by ten lepers , who stood at a distance .
AMPC	Luke	17	13	And they raised up their voices and called , Jesus , Master , take pity and have mercy on us !
AMPC	Luke	17	14	And when He saw them , He said to them , Go [ at once ] and show yourselves to the priests . And as they went , they were cured and made clean . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	17	15	Then one of them , upon seeing that he was cured , turned back , [ c ] recognizing and thanking and praising God with a loud voice ;
AMPC	Luke	17	16	And he fell prostrate at Jesus ’ feet , thanking Him [ over and over ] . And he was a Samaritan .
AMPC	Luke	17	18	Was there no one found to return and to [ d ] recognize and give thanks and praise to God except this alien ?
AMPC	Luke	17	19	And He said to him , Get up and go on your way . Your faith ( your trust and confidence that spring from your belief in God ) has restored you to health .
AMPC	Luke	17	20	Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , He replied to them by saying , The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed or with visible display ,
AMPC	Luke	17	21	Nor will people say , Look ! Here [ it is ] ! or , See , [ it is ] there ! For behold , the kingdom of God is within you [ in your hearts ] and among you [ surrounding you ] .
AMPC	Luke	17	22	And He said to the disciples , The time is coming when you will long to see [ even ] one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see [ it ] .
AMPC	Luke	17	23	And they will say to you , Look ! [ He is ] there ! or , Look ! [ He is ] here ! But do not go out or follow [ them ] .
AMPC	Luke	17	24	For like the lightning , that flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other , so will the Son of Man be in His [ own ] day .
AMPC	Luke	17	25	But first He must suffer many things and be disapproved and repudiated and rejected by this age and generation .
AMPC	Luke	17	26	And [ just ] as it was in the days of Noah , so will it be in the time of the Son of Man .
AMPC	Luke	17	27	[ People ] ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , right up to the day when Noah went into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	17	28	So also [ it was the same ] as it was in the days of Lot . [ People ] ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ;
AMPC	Luke	17	29	But on the [ very ] day that Lot went out of Sodom , it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [ them ] all .
AMPC	Luke	17	30	That is the way it will be on the day that the Son of Man is revealed . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	17	31	On that day let him who is on the housetop , with his belongings in the house , not come down [ and go inside ] to carry them away ; and likewise let him who is in the field not turn back .
AMPC	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife ! ( D )
AMPC	Luke	17	33	Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life will preserve and [ e ] quicken it .
AMPC	Luke	17	34	I tell you , in that night there will be two men in one bed ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
AMPC	Luke	17	35	There will be two women grinding together ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
AMPC	Luke	17	36	[ f ] Two men will be in the field ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
AMPC	Luke	17	37	Then they asked Him , Where , Lord ? He said to them , Wherever the dead body is , there will the vultures or eagles be gathered together . Footnotes - Luke 17:2 G.

AMPC	Luke	18	18	And a certain ruler asked Him , Good Teacher [ You who are [ m ] essentially and perfectly [ n ] morally good ] , what shall I do to inherit eternal life [ to partake of eternal salvation in the Messiah ’ s kingdom ] ?
AMPC	Luke	18	2	He said , In a certain city there was a judge who neither reverenced and feared God nor respected or considered man .
AMPC	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying , Protect and defend and give me justice against my adversary .
AMPC	Luke	18	4	And for a time he would not ; but later he said to himself , Though I have neither reverence or fear for God nor respect or consideration for man ,
AMPC	Luke	18	5	Yet because this widow continues to bother me , I will defend and protect and avenge her , lest she give me [ b ] intolerable annoyance and wear me out by her continual coming or [ c ] at the last she come and rail on me or [ d ] assault me or [ e ] strangle me .
AMPC	Luke	18	6	Then the Lord said , Listen to what the unjust judge says !
AMPC	Luke	18	7	And will not [ our just ] God defend and protect and avenge His elect ( His chosen ones ) , who cry to Him day and night ? Will He [ f ] defer them and [ g ] delay help on their behalf ?
AMPC	Luke	18	8	I tell you , He will defend and protect and avenge them speedily . However , when the Son of Man comes , will He find [ [ h ] persistence in ] faith on the earth ?
AMPC	Luke	18	9	He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves and were confident that they were righteous [ that they were upright and in right standing with God ] and scorned and made nothing of all the rest of men :
AMPC	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple [ [ i ] enclosure ] to pray , the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
AMPC	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee [ j ] took his stand ostentatiously and began to pray thus before and with himself : God , I thank You that I am not like the rest of men—extortioners ( robbers ) , swindlers [ unrighteous in heart and life ] , adulterers—or even like this tax collector here .
AMPC	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week ; I give tithes of all that I gain .
AMPC	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector , [ merely ] standing at a distance , would not even lift up his eyes to heaven , but kept striking his breast , saying , O God , be favorable ( be gracious , be merciful ) to me , the [ k ] especially wicked sinner that I am !
AMPC	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his home justified ( forgiven and made upright and in right standing with God ) , rather than the other man ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself will be exalted .
AMPC	Luke	18	15	Now they were also bringing [ even ] babies to Him that He might touch them , and when the disciples noticed it , they reproved them .
AMPC	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them [ [ l ] the parents ] to Him , saying , Allow the little children to come to Me , and do not hinder them , for to such [ as these ] belongs the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	18	17	Truly I say to you , whoever does not accept and receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a little child [ does ] shall not in any way enter it [ at all ] .
AMPC	Luke	18	19	Jesus said to him , Why do you call Me [ [ o ] essentially and perfectly [ p ] morally ] good ? No one is [ [ q ] essentially and perfectly [ r ] morally ] good—except God only .
AMPC	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : Do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , do not witness falsely , honor your father and your mother . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	18	21	And he replied , All these I have kept from my youth .
AMPC	Luke	18	22	And when Jesus heard it , He said to him , One thing you still lack . Sell everything that you have and [ s ] divide [ the money ] among the poor , and you will have [ rich ] treasure in heaven ; and come back [ and ] follow Me [ become My disciple , join My party , and accompany Me ] .
AMPC	Luke	18	23	But when he heard this , he became distressed and very sorrowful , for he was rich—exceedingly so .
AMPC	Luke	18	24	Jesus , observing him , said , How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God !
AMPC	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle ’ s eye than [ for ] a rich man to enter the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	18	26	And those who heard it said , Then who can be saved ?
AMPC	Luke	18	27	But He said , What is impossible with men is possible with God . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	18	28	And Peter said , See , we have left our own [ things—home , family , and business ] and have followed You .
AMPC	Luke	18	29	And He said to them , I say to you truly , there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
AMPC	Luke	18	30	Who will not receive in return many times more in this world and , in the coming age , eternal life .
AMPC	Luke	18	31	Then taking the Twelve [ apostles ] aside , He said to them , Listen ! We are going up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written about the Son of Man through and by the prophets will be fulfilled . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	18	32	For He will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be made sport of and scoffed and jeered at and insulted and spit upon . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	18	33	They will flog Him and kill Him ; and on the third day He will rise again . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	18	34	But they understood nothing of these things ; His words were a mystery and hidden from them , and they did not comprehend what He was telling them .
AMPC	Luke	18	35	As He came near to Jericho , it occurred that a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
AMPC	Luke	18	36	And hearing a crowd going by , he asked what it meant .
AMPC	Luke	18	37	They told him , Jesus of Nazareth is passing by .
AMPC	Luke	18	38	And he shouted , saying , Jesus , Son of David , take pity and have mercy on me !
AMPC	Luke	18	39	But those who were in front reproved him , telling him to keep quiet ; yet he [ t ] screamed and shrieked so much the more , Son of David , take pity and have mercy on me !
AMPC	Luke	18	40	Then Jesus stood still and ordered that he be led to Him ; and when he came near , Jesus asked him ,
AMPC	Luke	18	41	What do you want Me to do for you ? He said , Lord , let me receive my sight !
AMPC	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him , Receive your sight ! Your faith ( [ u ] your trust and confidence that spring from your faith in God ) has healed you .
AMPC	Luke	18	43	And instantly he received his sight and began to follow Jesus , [ v ] recognizing , praising , and honoring God ; and all the people , when they saw it , praised God .

AMPC	Luke	19	19	And he said also to him , And you will take charge over five cities .
AMPC	Luke	19	2	And there was a man called Zacchaeus , a chief tax collector , and [ he was ] rich .
AMPC	Luke	19	3	And he was trying to see Jesus , which One He was , but he could not on account of the crowd , because he was small in stature .
AMPC	Luke	19	4	So he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him , for He was about to pass that way .
AMPC	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus reached the place , He looked up and said to him , Zacchaeus , hurry and come down ; for I must stay at your house today .
AMPC	Luke	19	6	So he hurried and came down , and he received and welcomed Him joyfully .
AMPC	Luke	19	7	And when the people saw it , they all [ a ] muttered among themselves and indignantly complained , He has gone in to be the guest of and lodge with a man who is devoted to sin and preeminently a sinner .
AMPC	Luke	19	8	So then Zacchaeus stood up and solemnly declared to the Lord , See , Lord , the half of my goods I [ now ] give [ by way of restoration ] to the poor , and if I have cheated anyone out of anything , I [ now ] restore four times as much . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said to him , Today is [ [ b ] Messianic and spiritual ] salvation come to [ all the members of ] this household , since Zacchaeus too is a [ real spiritual ] son of Abraham ;
AMPC	Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost .
AMPC	Luke	19	11	Now as they were listening to these things , He proceeded to tell a parable , because He was approaching Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to be brought to light and shown forth immediately .
AMPC	Luke	19	12	He therefore said , A certain nobleman went into a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom and then to return .
AMPC	Luke	19	13	Calling ten of his [ own ] bond servants , he gave them ten minas [ each equal to about one hundred days ’ wages or nearly twenty dollars ] and said to them , [ c ] Buy and sell with these [ d ] while I go and then return .
AMPC	Luke	19	14	But his citizens detested him and sent an embassy after him to say , We do not want this man to become ruler over us .
AMPC	Luke	19	15	When he returned after having received the kingdom , he ordered these bond servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him , that he might know how much each one had made by [ e ] buying and selling .
AMPC	Luke	19	16	The first one came before him , and he said , Lord , your mina has made ten [ additional ] minas .
AMPC	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , Well done , excellent bond servant ! Because you have been faithful and trustworthy in a very little [ thing ] , you shall have authority over ten cities .
AMPC	Luke	19	18	The second one also came and said , Lord , your mina has made five more minas .
AMPC	Luke	19	20	Then another came and said , Lord , here is your mina , which I have kept laid up in a [ f ] handkerchief .
AMPC	Luke	19	21	For I was [ constantly ] afraid of you , because you are a stern ( hard , severe ) man ; you pick up what you did not lay down , and you reap what you did not sow .
AMPC	Luke	19	22	He said to the servant , I will judge and condemn you out of your own mouth , you wicked slave ! You knew [ did you ] that I was a stern ( hard , severe ) man , picking up what I did not lay down , and reaping what I did not sow ?
AMPC	Luke	19	23	Then why did you not put my money in a bank , so that on my return , I might have collected it with interest ?
AMPC	Luke	19	24	And he said to the bystanders , Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas .
AMPC	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , Lord , he has ten minas [ already ] !
AMPC	Luke	19	26	And [ said Jesus , ] I tell you that to everyone who gets and has will more be given , but from the man who does not get and does not have , even what he has will be taken away .
AMPC	Luke	19	27	[ The indignant king ended by saying ] But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them—bring them here and [ g ] slaughter them in my presence !
AMPC	Luke	19	28	And after saying these things , Jesus went on ahead of them , going up to Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	19	29	When He came near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called [ the Mount of ] Olives , He sent two of His disciples ,
AMPC	Luke	19	30	Telling [ them ] , Go into the village yonder ; there , as you go in , you will find a donkey ’ s colt tied , on which no man has ever yet sat . Loose it and bring [ it here ] .
AMPC	Luke	19	31	If anybody asks you , Why are you untying [ it ] ? you shall say this : Because the Lord has need of it .
AMPC	Luke	19	32	So those who were sent went away and found it [ just ] as He had told them .
AMPC	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosening the colt , its owners said to them , Why are you untying the colt ?
AMPC	Luke	19	34	And they said , The Lord has need of it .
AMPC	Luke	19	35	And they brought it to Jesus ; then they threw their garments over the colt and set Jesus upon it . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	19	36	And as He rode along , the people kept spreading their garments on the road . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	19	37	As He was approaching [ the city ] , at the descent of the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of the disciples began to rejoice and to praise God [ extolling Him exultantly and ] loudly for all the mighty miracles and works of power that they had witnessed ,
AMPC	Luke	19	38	Crying , Blessed ( celebrated with praises ) is the King Who comes in the name of the Lord ! Peace in heaven [ [ h ] freedom there from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ] and glory ( majesty and splendor ) in the highest [ heaven ] ! ( D )
AMPC	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from the throng said to Jesus , Teacher , reprove Your disciples !
AMPC	Luke	19	40	He replied , I tell you that if these keep silent , the very stones will cry out . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	19	41	And as He approached , He saw the city , and He wept [ [ i ] audibly ] over it ,
AMPC	Luke	19	42	Exclaiming , Would that you had known personally , even at least in this your day , the things that make for peace ( for [ j ] freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin and upon which your peace—your [ k ] security , safety , prosperity , and happiness—depends ) ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
AMPC	Luke	19	43	For a time is coming upon you when your enemies will throw up a [ l ] bank [ with pointed stakes ] about you and surround you and shut you in on every side . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	19	44	And they will dash you down to the ground , you [ Jerusalem ] and your children within you ; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another , [ all ] because you did not come progressively to recognize and know and understand [ from observation and experience ] the time of your visitation [ that is , when God was visiting you , the time [ m ] in which God showed Himself gracious toward you and offered you salvation through Christ ] .
AMPC	Luke	19	45	Then He went into the temple [ [ n ] enclosure ] and began to drive out those who were selling ,
AMPC	Luke	19	46	Telling them , It is written , My house shall be a house of prayer ; but you have made it a [ o ] cave of robbers . ( G )
AMPC	Luke	19	47	And He continued to teach day after day in the temple [ [ p ] porches and courts ] . The chief priests and scribes and the leading men of the people were seeking to put Him to death ,
AMPC	Luke	19	48	But they did not discover anything they could do , for all the people hung upon His words and [ q ] stuck by Him . Footnotes - Luke 19:7 G.

AMPC	Luke	20	20	So they watched [ for an opportunity to ensnare ] Him , and sent spies who pretended to be upright ( honest and sincere ) , that they might lay hold of something He might say , so as to turn Him over to the control and authority of the governor .
AMPC	Luke	20	2	And said to Him , Tell us by what [ sort of ] authority You are doing these things ? Or who is it who gave You this authority ?
AMPC	Luke	20	3	He replied to them , I will also ask you a question . Now answer Me :
AMPC	Luke	20	4	Was the baptism of John from heaven , or from men ?
AMPC	Luke	20	5	And they argued and discussed [ it ] and reasoned together [ b ] with themselves , saying , If we reply , From heaven , He will say , Why then did you not believe him ?
AMPC	Luke	20	6	But if we answer , From men , all the people will stone us [ c ] to death , for they are [ d ] long since firmly convinced that John was a prophet .
AMPC	Luke	20	7	So they replied that they did not know from where it came .
AMPC	Luke	20	8	Then Jesus said to them , Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
AMPC	Luke	20	9	Then He began to relate to the people this parable ( [ e ] this story to figuratively portray what He had to say ) : A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some vinedressers and went into another country for a long stay . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	20	10	When the [ right ] season came , he sent a bond servant to the tenants , that they might give him [ his part ] of the fruit of the vineyard ; but the tenants beat ( [ f ] thrashed ) him and sent him away empty-handed .
AMPC	Luke	20	11	And he sent still another servant ; him they also beat ( [ g ] thrashed ) and dishonored and insulted him [ h ] disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed .
AMPC	Luke	20	12	And he sent yet a third ; this one they wounded and threw out [ of the vineyard ] .
AMPC	Luke	20	13	Then the owner of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; it is [ i ] probable that they will respect him .
AMPC	Luke	20	14	But when the tenants saw him , they argued among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; let us kill him , so that the inheritance may be ours .
AMPC	Luke	20	15	So they drove him out of the vineyard and killed him . What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
AMPC	Luke	20	16	He will come and [ [ j ] utterly ] put an end to those tenants and will give the vineyard to others . When they [ the chief priests and the scribes and the elders ] heard this , they said , May it never be !
AMPC	Luke	20	17	But [ Jesus ] looked at them and said , What then is [ the meaning of ] this that is written : The [ very ] Stone which the builders rejected has become the chief Stone of the corner [ Cornerstone ] ? ( B )
AMPC	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that Stone will be broken [ in pieces ] ; but upon whomever It falls , It will crush him [ winnow him and [ k ] scatter him as dust ] . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests desired and tried to find a way to arrest Him at that very hour , but they were afraid of the people ; for they discerned that He had related this parable against them .
AMPC	Luke	20	21	They asked Him , Teacher , we know that You speak and teach what is right , and that You show no partiality to anyone but teach the way of God honestly and in truth .
AMPC	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not ?
AMPC	Luke	20	23	But He recognized and understood their cunning and [ l ] unscrupulousness and said to them ,
AMPC	Luke	20	24	Show Me a denarius ( a coin ) ! Whose image and inscription does it have ? They answered , Caesar ’ s .
AMPC	Luke	20	25	He said to them , Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , [ m ] and to God the things that are God ’ s .
AMPC	Luke	20	26	So they could not in the presence of the people take hold of anything He said to turn it against Him ; but marveling at His reply , they were silent .
AMPC	Luke	20	27	Also there came to Him some Sadducees , those who say that there is no resurrection .
AMPC	Luke	20	28	And they asked Him a question , saying , Teacher , Moses wrote for us [ a law ] that if a man ’ s brother dies , leaving a wife and no children , the man shall take the woman and raise up offspring for his brother . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and died without [ having any ] children .
AMPC	Luke	20	30	And the second
AMPC	Luke	20	31	And then the third took her , and in like manner all seven , and they died , leaving no children .
AMPC	Luke	20	32	Last of all , the woman died also .
AMPC	Luke	20	33	Now in the resurrection whose wife will the woman be ? For the seven married her .
AMPC	Luke	20	34	And Jesus said to them , The people of this world and present age marry and are given in marriage ;
AMPC	Luke	20	35	But those who are considered worthy to gain that other world and that future age and to attain to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
AMPC	Luke	20	36	For they can not die again , but they are [ n ] angel-like and [ o ] equal to angels . And being sons of and [ p ] sharers in the resurrection , they are sons of God .
AMPC	Luke	20	37	But that the dead are raised [ [ q ] from death ] —even Moses made known and showed in the passage concerning the [ burning ] bush , where he calls the Lord , The God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	20	38	Now He is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for to Him all men are alive [ whether in the body or out of it ] and they are alive [ not dead ] unto Him [ in definite relationship to Him ] .
AMPC	Luke	20	39	And some of the scribes replied , Teacher , you have spoken well and expertly [ [ r ] so that there is no room for blame ] .
AMPC	Luke	20	40	For they did not dare to question Him further .
AMPC	Luke	20	41	But He asked them , How can people say that the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) is David ’ s Son ?
AMPC	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in [ the ] Book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at My right hand
AMPC	Luke	20	43	Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	20	44	So David calls Him Lord ; how then is He his Son ?
AMPC	Luke	20	45	And with all the people listening , He said to His disciples ,
AMPC	Luke	20	46	Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes and love to be saluted [ with honor ] in places where people congregate and love the front and best seats in the synagogues and places of distinction at feasts ,
AMPC	Luke	20	47	Who make away with and devour widows ’ houses , and [ to cover it up ] with pretense make long prayers . They will receive the greater condemnation ( the heavier sentence , the severer punishment ) .

AMPC	Luke	21	21	Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains , and let those who are inside [ the city ] get out of it , and let not those who are out in the country come into it ;
AMPC	Luke	21	2	And He saw also a poor widow putting in two mites ( copper coins ) .
AMPC	Luke	21	3	And He said , Truly I say to you , this poor widow has put in more than all of them ;
AMPC	Luke	21	4	For they all gave out of their abundance ( their surplus ) ; but she has contributed out of her lack and her want , putting in all that she had on which to live .
AMPC	Luke	21	5	And as some were saying of the temple that it was decorated with handsome ( shapely and magnificent ) stones and consecrated offerings [ [ a ] laid up to be kept ] , He said ,
AMPC	Luke	21	6	As for all this that you [ thoughtfully ] look at , the time will come when there shall not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down .
AMPC	Luke	21	7	And they asked Him , Teacher , when will this happen ? And what sign will there be when this is about to occur ?
AMPC	Luke	21	8	And He said , Be on your guard and be careful that you are not led astray ; for many will come in My name [ [ b ] appropriating to themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me ] , saying , I am He ! and , The time is at hand ! Do not go out after them .
AMPC	Luke	21	9	And when you hear of wars and insurrections ( disturbances , disorder , and confusion ) , do not become alarmed and panic-stricken and terrified ; for all this must take place first , but the end will not [ come ] immediately .
AMPC	Luke	21	10	Then He told them , Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	21	11	There will be mighty and violent earthquakes , and in various places famines and pestilences ( plagues : [ c ] malignant and contagious or infectious epidemic diseases which are deadly and devastating ) ; and there will be sights of terror and great signs from heaven .
AMPC	Luke	21	12	But previous to all this , they will lay their hands on you and persecute you , turning you over to the synagogues and prisons , and you will be led away before kings and governors for My name ’ s sake .
AMPC	Luke	21	13	This will be a time ( an opportunity ) for you to bear testimony .
AMPC	Luke	21	14	Resolve and settle it in your minds not to meditate and prepare beforehand how you are to make your defense and how you will answer .
AMPC	Luke	21	15	For I [ Myself ] will give you a mouth and such utterance and wisdom that all of your foes combined will be unable to stand against or refute .
AMPC	Luke	21	16	You will be delivered up and betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and [ some ] of you they will put to death .
AMPC	Luke	21	17	And you will be hated ( despised ) by everyone because [ you bear ] My name and for its sake .
AMPC	Luke	21	18	But not a hair of your head shall perish . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	21	19	By your steadfastness and patient endurance you [ d ] shall win the [ e ] true life of your souls .
AMPC	Luke	21	20	But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , then know and understand that its desolation has come near .
AMPC	Luke	21	22	For those are days of vengeance [ of rendering full justice or satisfaction ] , that all things that are written may be fulfilled .
AMPC	Luke	21	23	Alas for those who are pregnant and for those who have babies which they are nursing in those days ! For great misery and anguish and distress shall be upon the land and indignation and punishment and retribution upon this people .
AMPC	Luke	21	24	They will fall by [ f ] the mouth and the edge of the sword and will be led away as captives to and among all nations ; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled ( completed ) . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	21	25	And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars ; and upon the earth [ there will be ] distress ( trouble and anguish ) of nations in bewilderment and perplexity [ [ g ] without resources , left wanting , embarrassed , in doubt , not knowing which way to turn ] at the roaring ( [ h ] the echo ) of the tossing of the sea , ( D )
AMPC	Luke	21	26	Men swooning away or expiring with fear and dread and apprehension and expectation of the things that are coming on the world ; for the [ very ] powers of the heavens will be shaken and [ i ] caused to totter .
AMPC	Luke	21	27	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great ( transcendent and overwhelming ) power and [ all His kingly ] glory ( majesty and splendor ) . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	21	28	Now when these things begin to occur , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption ( deliverance ) is drawing near .
AMPC	Luke	21	29	And He told them a parable : Look at the fig tree and all the trees ;
AMPC	Luke	21	30	When they put forth their buds and come out in leaf , you see for yourselves and perceive and know that summer is already near .
AMPC	Luke	21	31	Even so , when you see these things taking place , understand and know that the kingdom of God is at hand .
AMPC	Luke	21	32	Truly I tell you , this generation ( [ j ] those living at that definite period of time ) will not perish and pass away until all has taken place .
AMPC	Luke	21	33	The [ k ] sky and the earth ( [ l ] the universe , the world ) will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
AMPC	Luke	21	34	But take heed to yourselves and be on your guard , lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed ( weighed down ) with the [ m ] giddiness and headache and [ n ] nausea of self-indulgence , drunkenness , and worldly worries and cares pertaining to [ the [ o ] business of ] this life , and [ lest ] that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose ;
AMPC	Luke	21	35	For it will come upon all who live upon the face of the entire earth .
AMPC	Luke	21	36	Keep awake then and watch at all times [ be discreet , attentive , and ready ] , praying that you may have the full strength and ability and be accounted worthy to escape all these things [ taken together ] that will take place , and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man .
AMPC	Luke	21	37	Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [ [ p ] the porches and courts of ] the temple , but at night He would go out and stay on the mount called Olivet .
AMPC	Luke	21	38	And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple [ [ q ] porches or courts ] to listen to Him .

AMPC	Luke	22	22	For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed , but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up !
AMPC	Luke	22	2	And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [ Jesus ] , for they feared the people .
AMPC	Luke	22	3	But [ then ] Satan entered into Judas , called Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve [ apostles ] .
AMPC	Luke	22	4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him and deliver Him up to them .
AMPC	Luke	22	5	And they were delighted and pledged [ themselves ] to give him money .
AMPC	Luke	22	6	So he agreed [ to this ] , and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [ without an uprising ] in the absence of the throng .
AMPC	Luke	22	7	Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [ lamb ] had to be slain . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	22	8	So Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare for us the Passover meal , that we may eat it .
AMPC	Luke	22	9	They said to Him , Where do You want us to prepare [ it ] ?
AMPC	Luke	22	10	He said to them , Behold , when you have gone into the city , a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you ; follow him into the house which he enters ,
AMPC	Luke	22	11	And say to the master of the house , The Teacher asks you , Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Passover [ meal ] with My disciples ?
AMPC	Luke	22	12	And he will show you a large room upstairs , furnished [ with carpets and with couches properly spread ] ; there make [ your ] preparations .
AMPC	Luke	22	13	And they went and found it [ just ] as He had said to them ; and they made ready the Passover [ supper ] .
AMPC	Luke	22	14	And when the hour came , [ Jesus ] reclined at table , and the apostles with Him .
AMPC	Luke	22	15	And He said to them , I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer ;
AMPC	Luke	22	16	For I say to you , I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	22	17	And He took a cup , and when He had given thanks , He said , Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves ;
AMPC	Luke	22	18	For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes .
AMPC	Luke	22	19	Then He took a loaf [ of bread ] , and when He had given thanks , He broke [ it ] and gave it to them saying , This is My body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me .
AMPC	Luke	22	20	And in like manner , He took the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament or covenant [ ratified ] in My blood , which is shed ( poured out ) for you .
AMPC	Luke	22	21	But , behold , the hand of him who [ a ] is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	22	23	And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	22	24	Now [ b ] an eager contention arose among them [ as to ] which of them was considered and reputed to be the greatest .
AMPC	Luke	22	25	But Jesus said to them , The kings of the Gentiles [ c ] are deified by them and exercise lordship [ [ d ] ruling as emperor-gods ] over them ; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers .
AMPC	Luke	22	26	But this is not to be so with you ; on the contrary , let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest , and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves .
AMPC	Luke	22	27	For who is the greater , the one who reclines at table ( the master ) , or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines at table ? But I am in your midst as One Who serves .
AMPC	Luke	22	28	And you are those who have remained [ throughout ] and persevered with Me in My trials ;
AMPC	Luke	22	29	And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me , so do I confer on you [ the privilege and decree ] ,
AMPC	Luke	22	30	That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
AMPC	Luke	22	31	Simon , Simon ( Peter ) , listen ! Satan [ e ] has asked excessively that [ all of ] you be given up to him [ out of the power and keeping of God ] , that he might sift [ all of ] you like grain , ( D )
AMPC	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed especially for you [ Peter ] , that your [ own ] faith may not fail ; and when you yourself have turned again , strengthen and establish your brethren .
AMPC	Luke	22	33	And [ Simon Peter ] said to Him , Lord , I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death .
AMPC	Luke	22	34	But Jesus said , I tell you , Peter , before a [ single ] cock shall crow this day , you will three times [ utterly ] deny that you know Me .
AMPC	Luke	22	35	And He said to them , When I sent you out with no purse or [ provision ] bag or sandals , did you lack anything ? They answered , Nothing !
AMPC	Luke	22	36	Then He said to them , But now let him who has a purse take it , and also [ his provision ] bag ; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword .
AMPC	Luke	22	37	For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me : And He was counted and classed among the wicked ( the outlaws , the criminals ) ; for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [ has reached its end and is finally settled ] . ( E )
AMPC	Luke	22	38	And they said , Look , Lord ! Here are two swords . And He said to them , It is enough .
AMPC	Luke	22	39	And He came out and went , as was His habit , to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples also followed Him .
AMPC	Luke	22	40	And when He came to the place , He said to them , Pray that you may not [ at all ] enter into temptation .
AMPC	Luke	22	41	And He withdrew from them about a stone ’ s throw and knelt down and prayed ,
AMPC	Luke	22	42	Saying , Father , if You are willing , remove this cup from Me ; yet not My will , but [ [ f ] always ] Yours be done .
AMPC	Luke	22	43	And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven , strengthening Him in spirit .
AMPC	Luke	22	44	And being in an agony [ of mind ] , He prayed [ all the ] more earnestly and intently , and His sweat became like great [ g ] clots of blood dropping down upon the ground .
AMPC	Luke	22	45	And when He got up from prayer , He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief ,
AMPC	Luke	22	46	And He said to them , Why do you sleep ? Get up and pray that you may not enter [ at all ] into temptation .
AMPC	Luke	22	47	And while He was still speaking , behold , there came a crowd , and the man called Judas , one of the Twelve [ apostles ] , was going before [ leading ] them . He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him ,
AMPC	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said to him , Judas ! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss ?
AMPC	Luke	22	49	And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen , they said , Lord , shall we strike with the sword ?
AMPC	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear , the right one .
AMPC	Luke	22	51	But Jesus said , Permit [ h ] them to go so far [ as to seize Me ] . And He touched the [ i ] little ( insignificant ) ear and healed him .
AMPC	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him—the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [ of the Sanhedrin ] —Have you come out with swords and clubs as [ you would ] against a robber ?
AMPC	Luke	22	53	When I was with you day after day in the temple [ [ j ] enclosure ] , you did not stretch forth [ your ] hands against Me . But this is your hour—and the power [ which ] darkness [ gives you has its way ] .
AMPC	Luke	22	54	Then they seized Him and led Him away , bringing Him into the house of the high priest . Peter was following at a distance .
AMPC	Luke	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together , Peter sat among them .
AMPC	Luke	22	56	Then a servant girl , seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [ intently ] at him , said , This man too was with [ k ] Him .
AMPC	Luke	22	57	But he denied it and said , Woman , I do not know Him !
AMPC	Luke	22	58	And a little later someone else saw him and said , You are one of them also . But Peter said , Man , I am not !
AMPC	Luke	22	59	And when about an hour more had elapsed , still another emphatically insisted , It is the truth that this man also was with Him , for he too is a Galilean !
AMPC	Luke	22	60	But Peter said , Man , I do not know what you are talking about . And instantly , while he was still speaking , the cock crowed .
AMPC	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turned and looked at Peter . And Peter recalled the Lord ’ s words , how He had told him , Before the cock crows today , you will deny Me thrice .
AMPC	Luke	22	62	And he went out and wept bitterly [ that is , with painfully moving grief ] .
AMPC	Luke	22	63	Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him and beat Him ;
AMPC	Luke	22	64	They blindfolded Him also and asked Him , Prophesy ! Who is it that struck [ l ] You ?
AMPC	Luke	22	65	And they said many other evil and slanderous and insulting words against Him , reviling Him .
AMPC	Luke	22	66	As soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together , both chief priests and scribes ; and they led Him into their council ( the Sanhedrin ) , and they said ,
AMPC	Luke	22	67	If You are the Christ ( the Messiah ) , tell us . But He said to them , If I tell you , you will not believe ( trust in , cleave to , and rely on what I say ) ,
AMPC	Luke	22	68	And if I question you , you will not answer .
AMPC	Luke	22	69	But hereafter ( from this time on ) , the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	22	70	And they all said , You are the Son of God , then ? And He said to them , [ m ] It is just as you say ; I Am .
AMPC	Luke	22	71	And they said , What further evidence do we need ? For we have heard [ it ] ourselves from His own mouth !

AMPC	Luke	23	23	But they were insistent and urgent , demanding with loud cries that He should be crucified . And their voices prevailed ( accomplished their purpose ) .
AMPC	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse Him , asserting , We found this [ a ] Man perverting ( misleading , corrupting , and turning away ) our nation and forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar , saying that He Himself is Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) , a King !
AMPC	Luke	23	3	So Pilate asked Him , Are You the King of the Jews ? And He answered him , [ [ b ] It is just as ] you say . [ I Am . ]
AMPC	Luke	23	4	And Pilate said to the chief priests and the throngs , I find no guilt or crime in this Man .
AMPC	Luke	23	5	But they were urgent and emphatic , saying , He stirs up and excites the people , teaching throughout all Judea—from Galilee , where He began , even to this place .
AMPC	Luke	23	6	Upon hearing this , Pilate asked whether the Man was a Galilean .
AMPC	Luke	23	7	And when he found out [ certainly ] that He belonged to Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent Him up to Herod [ a higher authority ] , who was also in Jerusalem in those days .
AMPC	Luke	23	8	Now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had eagerly desired to see Him for a long time because of what he had heard concerning Him , and he was hoping to witness some sign ( some striking evidence or spectacular performance ) done by Him .
AMPC	Luke	23	9	So he asked Him many questions , but He made no reply . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	23	10	Meanwhile , the chief priests and the scribes stood by , continuing vehemently and violently to accuse Him .
AMPC	Luke	23	11	And Herod , with his soldiers , treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him ; then , dressing Him up in bright and gorgeous apparel , he sent Him back to Pilate . ( B )
AMPC	Luke	23	12	And that very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other— [ though ] they had been at enmity before this .
AMPC	Luke	23	13	Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
AMPC	Luke	23	14	And said to them , You brought this Man before me as One Who was perverting and misleading and [ c ] turning away and corrupting the people ; and behold , after examining Him before you , I have not found any offense ( crime or guilt ) in this Man in regard to your accusations against Him ;
AMPC	Luke	23	15	No , nor indeed did Herod , for he sent Him back to us ; behold , He has done nothing deserving of death .
AMPC	Luke	23	16	I will therefore chastise Him and [ d ] deliver Him amended ( reformed , taught His lesson ) and release Him .
AMPC	Luke	23	17	[ e ] For it was necessary for him to release to them one prisoner at the Feast .
AMPC	Luke	23	18	But they all together raised a deep cry [ from the depths of their throats ] , saying , Away with this Man ! Release to us Barabbas !
AMPC	Luke	23	19	He was a man who had been thrown into prison for raising a riot in the city , and for murder .
AMPC	Luke	23	20	Once more Pilate called to them , wishing to release Jesus ;
AMPC	Luke	23	21	But they kept shouting out , Crucify , crucify Him !
AMPC	Luke	23	22	A third time he said to them , Why ? What wrong has He done ? I have found [ no offense or crime or guilt ] in Him nothing deserving of death ; I will therefore chastise Him [ [ f ] in order to teach Him better ] and release Him .
AMPC	Luke	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence , that what they asked should be done .
AMPC	Luke	23	25	So he released the man who had been thrown into prison for riot and murder , for whom they continued to ask , but Jesus he delivered up to be done with as they willed .
AMPC	Luke	23	26	And as they led Him away , they seized one Simon of Cyrene , who was coming in from the country , and laid on him the cross and made him carry it behind Jesus .
AMPC	Luke	23	27	And there accompanied [ Jesus ] a great multitude of the people , [ including ] women who bewailed and lamented Him .
AMPC	Luke	23	28	But Jesus , turning toward them , said , Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for Me , but weep for yourselves and for your children .
AMPC	Luke	23	29	For behold , the days are coming during which they will say , Blessed ( happy , fortunate , and [ g ] to be envied ) are the barren , and the wombs that have not borne , and the breasts that have never nursed [ babies ] !
AMPC	Luke	23	30	Then they will begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ! and to the hills , Cover ( conceal , hide ) us !
AMPC	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things when the timber is green , what will happen when it is dry ?
AMPC	Luke	23	32	Two others also , who were criminals , were led away to be executed with Him . ( C )
AMPC	Luke	23	33	And when they came to the place which is called The Skull [ Latin : Calvary ; Hebrew : Golgotha ] , there they crucified Him , and [ along with ] the criminals , one on the right and one on the left .
AMPC	Luke	23	34	And Jesus prayed , Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . And they divided His garments and distributed them by casting lots for them . ( D )
AMPC	Luke	23	35	Now the people stood by [ [ h ] calmly and leisurely ] watching ; but the rulers scoffed and sneered ( [ i ] turned up their noses ) at Him , saying , He rescued others [ [ j ] from death ] ; let Him now rescue Himself , if He is the Christ ( the Messiah ) of God , His Chosen One !
AMPC	Luke	23	36	The soldiers also ridiculed and made sport of Him , coming up and offering Him vinegar ( a sour wine mixed with water ) ( E )
AMPC	Luke	23	37	And saying , If you are the King of the Jews , save ( rescue ) Yourself [ [ k ] from death ] .
AMPC	Luke	23	38	For there was also an inscription above Him [ l ] in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew : This is the King of the Jews .
AMPC	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals who was suspended kept up a railing at Him , saying , Are You not the Christ ( the Messiah ) ? Rescue Yourself and us [ [ m ] from death ] !
AMPC	Luke	23	40	But the other one reproved him , saying , Do you not even fear God , seeing you yourself are under the same sentence of condemnation and suffering the same penalty ?
AMPC	Luke	23	41	And we indeed suffer it justly , receiving the due reward of our actions ; but this Man has done nothing out of the way [ nothing [ n ] strange or eccentric or perverse or unreasonable ] .
AMPC	Luke	23	42	Then he said to Jesus , Lord , remember me when You come [ o ] in Your kingly glory !
AMPC	Luke	23	43	And He answered him , Truly I tell you , today you shall be with Me in Paradise .
AMPC	Luke	23	44	It was now about the sixth hour ( midday ) , and darkness enveloped the whole land and earth until the ninth hour ( about three o ’ clock in the afternoon ) ,
AMPC	Luke	23	45	While the sun ’ s light faded or [ p ] was darkened ; and the curtain [ of the Holy of Holies ] of the temple was torn in two . ( F )
AMPC	Luke	23	46	And Jesus , crying out with a loud voice , said , Father , into Your hands I commit My spirit ! And with these words , He expired . ( G )
AMPC	Luke	23	47	Now the centurion , having seen what had taken place , [ q ] recognized God and thanked and praised Him , and said , Indeed , without question , this Man was upright ( just and innocent ) !
AMPC	Luke	23	48	And all the throngs that had gathered to see this spectacle , when they saw what had taken place , returned to their homes , beating their breasts .
AMPC	Luke	23	49	And all the acquaintances of [ Jesus ] and the women who had followed Him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched these things .
AMPC	Luke	23	50	Now notice , there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathea . He was a member of the council ( the Sanhedrin ) , and a good ( upright , [ r ] advantageous ) man , and righteous ( in right standing with God and man ) ,
AMPC	Luke	23	51	Who had not agreed with or assented to the purpose and action of the others ; and he was expecting and waiting for the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus .
AMPC	Luke	23	53	Then he took it down and [ s ] rolled it up in a linen cloth [ t ] for swathing dead bodies and laid Him in a rock-hewn tomb , where no one had ever yet been laid .
AMPC	Luke	23	54	It was the day of Preparation [ for the Sabbath ] , and the Sabbath was dawning ( approaching ) .
AMPC	Luke	23	55	The women who had come with [ Jesus ] from Galilee followed closely and saw the tomb and how His body was laid .
AMPC	Luke	23	56	Then they went back and made ready spices and ointments ( perfumes ) . On the Sabbath day they rested in accordance with the commandment .

AMPC	Luke	24	24	So some of those [ who were ] with us went to the tomb and they found it just as the women had said , but Him they did not see .
AMPC	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled back from the tomb ,
AMPC	Luke	24	3	But when they went inside , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
AMPC	Luke	24	4	And while they were perplexed and wondering what to do about this , behold , two men in dazzling raiment suddenly stood beside them .
AMPC	Luke	24	5	And as [ the women ] were frightened and were bowing their faces to the ground , the men said to them , Why do you look for the living among [ those who are ] dead ?
AMPC	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but has risen ! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee
AMPC	Luke	24	7	That the Son of Man must be given over into the hands of sinful men ( men [ a ] whose way or nature is to act in opposition to God ) and be crucified and on the third day rise [ [ b ] from death ] . ( A )
AMPC	Luke	24	8	And they remembered His words .
AMPC	Luke	24	9	And having returned from the tomb , they reported all these things [ taken together ] to the eleven apostles and to all the rest .
AMPC	Luke	24	10	Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them , who reported these things to the apostles .
AMPC	Luke	24	11	But these reports seemed to the men an idle tale ( [ c ] madness , [ d ] feigned things , [ e ] nonsense ) , and they did not believe the women .
AMPC	Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb ; and stooping down and looking in , he saw the linen cloths alone by themselves , and he went away , wondering about and marveling at what had happened .
AMPC	Luke	24	13	And behold , that very day two of [ the disciples ] were going to a village called Emmaus , [ which is ] about seven miles from Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	24	14	And they were talking with each other about all these things that had occurred .
AMPC	Luke	24	15	And while they were conversing and discussing together , Jesus Himself caught up with them and was already accompanying them .
AMPC	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were held , so that they did not recognize Him .
AMPC	Luke	24	17	And He said to them , What is this discussion that you are exchanging ( [ f ] throwing back and forth ) between yourselves as you walk along ? And they stood still , looking sad and downcast .
AMPC	Luke	24	18	Then one of them , named Cleopas , answered Him , Do you alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things that have occurred there in these days ?
AMPC	Luke	24	19	And He said to them , What [ kind of ] things ? And they said to Him , About Jesus of Nazareth , Who was a Prophet mighty in work and word before God and all the people—
AMPC	Luke	24	20	And how our chief priests and rulers gave Him up to be sentenced to death , and crucified Him .
AMPC	Luke	24	21	But we were hoping that it was He Who would redeem and set Israel free . Yes , and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things occurred .
AMPC	Luke	24	22	And moreover , some women of our company astounded us and [ g ] drove us out of our senses . They were at the tomb early [ in the morning ]
AMPC	Luke	24	23	But did not find His body ; and they returned saying that they had [ even ] seen a vision of angels , who said that He was alive !
AMPC	Luke	24	25	And [ Jesus ] said to them , O foolish ones [ sluggish in mind , dull of perception ] and slow of heart to believe ( adhere to and trust in and rely on ) everything that the prophets have spoken !
AMPC	Luke	24	26	Was it not necessary and [ h ] essentially fitting that the Christ ( the Messiah ) should suffer all these things before entering into His glory ( His majesty and splendor ) ?
AMPC	Luke	24	27	Then beginning with Moses and [ throughout ] all the Prophets , He went on explaining and interpreting to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning and referring to Himself .
AMPC	Luke	24	28	Then they drew near the village to which they were going , and He acted as if He would go further .
AMPC	Luke	24	29	But they urged and insisted , saying to Him , Remain with us , for it is toward evening , and the day is now far spent . So He went in to stay with them .
AMPC	Luke	24	30	And it occurred that as He reclined at table with them , He took [ a loaf of ] bread and praised [ God ] and gave thanks and asked a blessing , and then broke it and was giving it to them
AMPC	Luke	24	31	When their eyes were [ instantly ] opened and they [ clearly ] recognized Him , and He vanished ( [ i ] departed invisibly ) .
AMPC	Luke	24	32	And they said to one another , Were not our hearts greatly moved and burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and as He opened and explained to us [ the sense of ] the Scriptures ?
AMPC	Luke	24	33	And rising up that very hour , they went back to Jerusalem , where they found the Eleven [ apostles ] gathered together and those who were with them ,
AMPC	Luke	24	34	Who said , The Lord really has risen and has appeared to Simon ( Peter ) !
AMPC	Luke	24	35	Then they [ themselves ] [ j ] related [ in full ] what had happened on the road , and how He was known and recognized by them in the breaking of bread .
AMPC	Luke	24	36	Now while they were talking about this , Jesus Himself took His stand among them and said to them , Peace ( [ k ] freedom from all the distresses that are experienced as the result of sin ) be to you !
AMPC	Luke	24	37	But they were so startled and terrified that they thought they saw a spirit .
AMPC	Luke	24	38	And He said to them , Why are you disturbed and troubled , and why do such doubts and questionings arise in your hearts ?
AMPC	Luke	24	39	See My hands and My feet , that it is I Myself ! Feel and handle Me and see , for a spirit does not have flesh and bones , as you see that I have .
AMPC	Luke	24	40	And when He had said this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
AMPC	Luke	24	41	And while [ since ] they still could not believe it for sheer joy and marveled , He said to them , Have you anything here to eat ?
AMPC	Luke	24	42	They gave Him a piece of broiled fish ,
AMPC	Luke	24	43	And He took [ it ] and ate [ it ] before them .
AMPC	Luke	24	44	Then He said to them , This is what I told you while I was still with you : everything which is written concerning Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled .
AMPC	Luke	24	45	Then He [ thoroughly ] opened up their minds to understand the Scriptures ,
AMPC	Luke	24	46	And said to them , Thus it is written that the Christ ( the Messiah ) should suffer and on the third day rise from ( [ l ] among ) the dead , ( B )
AMPC	Luke	24	47	And that repentance [ with a view to and as the condition of ] forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
AMPC	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
AMPC	Luke	24	49	And behold , I will send forth upon you what My Father has promised ; but remain in the city [ Jerusalem ] until you are clothed with power from on high .
AMPC	Luke	24	50	Then He conducted them out as far as Bethany , and , lifting up His hands , He invoked a blessing on them .
AMPC	Luke	24	51	And it occurred that while He was blessing them , He parted from them and was taken up into heaven .
AMPC	Luke	24	52	And they , worshiping Him , went back to Jerusalem with great joy ;
AMPC	Luke	24	53	And they were continually in the temple celebrating with praises and blessing and extolling God . Amen ( so be it ) .

AMPC	John	1	1	In the beginning [ before all time ] was the Word ( [ a ] Christ ) , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God [ b ] Himself . ( A )
AMPC	John	1	2	He was present originally with God .
AMPC	John	1	3	All things were made and came into existence through Him ; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being .
AMPC	John	1	4	In Him was Life , and the Life was the Light of men .
AMPC	John	1	5	And the Light shines on in the darkness , for the darkness has never overpowered it [ put it out or absorbed it or appropriated it , and is unreceptive to it ] .
AMPC	John	1	6	There came a man sent from God , whose name was John . ( B )
AMPC	John	1	7	This man came to witness , that he might testify of the Light , that all men might believe in it [ adhere to it , trust it , and rely upon it ] through him .
AMPC	John	1	8	He was not the Light himself , but came that he might bear witness regarding the Light .
AMPC	John	1	9	There it was—the true Light [ was then ] coming into the world [ the genuine , perfect , steadfast Light ] that illumines every person . ( C )
AMPC	John	1	10	He came into the world , and though the world was made through Him , the world did not recognize Him [ did not know Him ] .
AMPC	John	1	11	He came to that which belonged to Him [ to His own—His domain , creation , things , world ] , and they who were His own did not receive Him and did not welcome Him .
AMPC	John	1	12	But to as many as did receive and welcome Him , He gave the authority ( power , privilege , right ) to become the children of God , that is , to those who believe in ( adhere to , trust in , and rely on ) His name— ( D )
AMPC	John	1	13	Who owe their birth neither to [ c ] bloods nor to the will of the flesh [ that of physical impulse ] nor to the will of man [ that of a natural father ] , but to God . [ They are born of God ! ]
AMPC	John	1	14	And the Word ( Christ ) became flesh ( human , incarnate ) and tabernacled ( fixed His tent of flesh , lived awhile ) among us ; and we [ actually ] saw His glory ( His honor , His majesty ) , such glory as an only begotten son receives from his father , full of grace ( favor , loving-kindness ) and truth . ( E )
AMPC	John	1	15	John testified about Him and cried out , This was He of Whom I said , He Who comes after me has priority over me , for He was before me . [ He takes rank above me , for He existed before I did . He has advanced before me , because He is my Chief . ]

AMPC	John	1	17	For while the Law was given through Moses , grace ( [ d ] unearned , undeserved favor and spiritual blessing ) and truth came through Jesus Christ . ( F )
AMPC	John	1	18	No man has ever seen God at any time ; the only [ e ] unique Son , or [ f ] the only begotten God , Who is in the bosom [ in the intimate presence ] of the Father , He has declared Him [ He has revealed Him and brought Him out where He can be seen ; He has interpreted Him and He has made Him known ] . ( G )
AMPC	John	1	19	) , he sees Christ returning as Warrior-Messiah-King , and “ the title by which He is called is The Word of God ... and Lord of lords ” ( Rev . 19:13 ,
AMPC	John	1	20	He confessed ( admitted the truth ) and did not try to conceal it , but acknowledged , I am not the Christ !
AMPC	John	1	21	They asked him , What then ? Are you Elijah ? And he said , I am not ! Are you the Prophet ? And he answered , No ! ( H )
AMPC	John	1	22	Then they said to him , Who are you ? Tell us , so that we may give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ?
AMPC	John	1	23	He said , I am the voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness [ the voice of one shouting in the desert ] , Prepare the way of the Lord [ level , straighten out , the path of the Lord ] , as the prophet Isaiah said . ( I )
AMPC	John	1	24	The messengers had been sent from the Pharisees .
AMPC	John	1	25	And they asked him , Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ?
AMPC	John	1	26	John answered them , I [ only ] baptize [ g ] in ( with ) water . Among you there stands One Whom you do not recognize and with Whom you are not acquainted and of Whom you know nothing . ( J )
AMPC	John	1	27	It is He Who , coming after me , is preferred before me , the string of Whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose .
AMPC	John	1	28	These things occurred in Bethany ( Bethabara ) across the Jordan [ [ h ] at the Jordan crossing ] , where John was then baptizing .
AMPC	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said , Look ! There is the Lamb of God , Who takes away the sin of the world ! ( K )
AMPC	John	1	30	This is He of Whom I said , After me comes a Man Who has priority over me [ Who takes rank above me ] because He was before me and existed before I did .
AMPC	John	1	31	and
AMPC	John	1	32	John gave further evidence , saying , I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven , and it dwelt on Him [ never to depart ] .

AMPC	John	1	34	And I have seen [ that happen—I actually did see it ] and my testimony is that this is the Son of God !
AMPC	John	1	35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples ,
AMPC	John	1	36	And he looked at Jesus as He walked along , and said , Look ! There is the Lamb of God !
AMPC	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him say this , and they followed Him .
AMPC	John	1	38	But Jesus turned , and as He saw them following Him , He said to them , What are you looking for ? [ And what is it you wish ? ] And they answered Him , Rabbi—which translated is Teacher—where are You staying ?
AMPC	John	1	39	He said to them , Come and see . So they went and saw where He was staying , and they remained with Him [ k ] that day . It was then about the tenth hour ( about four o ’ clock in the afternoon ) .
AMPC	John	1	40	One of the two who heard what John said and followed Jesus was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
AMPC	John	1	41	He first sought out and found his own brother Simon and said to him , We have found ( discovered ) the Messiah ! —which translated is the Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	John	1	42	Andrew then led ( brought ) Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , You are Simon son of John . You shall be called Cephas—which translated is Peter [ Stone ] .
AMPC	John	1	43	The next day Jesus desired and decided to go into Galilee ; and He found Philip and said to him , Join Me as My attendant and follow Me .
AMPC	John	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , of the same city as Andrew and Peter .
AMPC	John	1	45	Philip sought and found Nathanael and told him , We have found ( discovered ) the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about—Jesus from Nazareth , the [ legal ] son of Joseph !
AMPC	John	1	46	Nathanael answered him , [ Nazareth ! ] Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? Philip replied , Come and see !
AMPC	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said concerning him , See ! Here is an Israelite indeed [ a true descendant of Jacob ] , in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor falsehood nor duplicity !
AMPC	John	1	48	Nathanael said to Jesus , How do You know me ? [ How is it that You know these things about me ? ] Jesus answered him , Before [ ever ] Philip called you , when you were still under the fig tree , I saw you .
AMPC	John	1	49	Nathanael answered , Teacher , You are the Son of God ! You are the King of Israel !
AMPC	John	1	50	Jesus replied , Because I said to you , I saw you beneath the fig tree , do you believe in and rely on and trust in Me ? You shall see greater things than this !
AMPC	John	1	51	Then He said to him , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you all , you shall see heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man ! ( L ) Footnotes - John 1:1 In John ’ s vision ( Rev .

AMPC	John	2	2	Jesus also was invited with His disciples to the wedding .
AMPC	John	2	3	And when the wine was all gone , the mother of Jesus said to Him , They have no more wine !
AMPC	John	2	4	Jesus said to her , [ [ a ] Dear ] woman , what is that to you and to Me ? [ What do we have in common ? Leave it to Me . ] My time ( hour to act ) has not yet come . ( A )
AMPC	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , Whatever He says to you , do it .
AMPC	John	2	6	Now there were six waterpots of stone standing there , as the Jewish custom of purification ( ceremonial washing ) demanded , holding twenty to thirty gallons apiece .
AMPC	John	2	7	Jesus said to them , Fill the waterpots with water . So they filled them up to the brim .
AMPC	John	2	8	Then He said to them , Draw some out now and take it to the manager of the feast [ to the one presiding , the superintendent of the banquet ] . So they took him some .
AMPC	John	2	9	And when the manager tasted the water just now turned into wine , not knowing where it came from—though the servants who had drawn the water knew—he called the bridegroom
AMPC	John	2	10	And said to him , Everyone else serves his best wine first , and when people have drunk freely , then he serves that which is not so good ; but you have kept back the good wine until now !
AMPC	John	2	11	This , the first of His signs ( miracles , wonderworks ) , Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee , and manifested His glory [ by it He displayed His greatness and His power openly ] , and His disciples believed in Him [ adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Him ] . ( B )
AMPC	John	2	12	After that He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and disciples , and they stayed there only a few days .
AMPC	John	2	13	Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching , so Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
AMPC	John	2	14	There He found in the temple [ [ b ] enclosure ] those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers sitting there [ also at their stands ] .
AMPC	John	2	15	And having made a lash ( a whip ) of cords , He drove them all out of the temple [ [ c ] enclosure ] —both the sheep and the oxen—spilling and scattering the brokers ’ money and upsetting and tossing around their trays ( their stands ) .
AMPC	John	2	16	Then to those who sold the doves He said , Take these things away ( out of here ) ! Make not My Father ’ s house a house of merchandise ( a marketplace , a sales shop ) ! ( C )
AMPC	John	2	17	And His disciples remembered that it is written [ in the Holy Scriptures ] , Zeal ( the fervor of love ) for Your house will eat Me up . [ I will be consumed with jealousy for the honor of Your house . ] ( D )
AMPC	John	2	18	Then the Jews retorted , What sign can [ d ] You show us , seeing You do these things ? [ What sign , miracle , token , indication can You give us as evidence that You have authority and are commissioned to act in this way ? ]
AMPC	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , Destroy ( undo ) this temple , and in three days I will raise it up again .
AMPC	John	2	20	Then the Jews replied , It took forty-six years to build this temple ( sanctuary ) , and will You raise it up in three days ?
AMPC	John	2	21	But He had spoken of the temple which was His body .
AMPC	John	2	22	When therefore He had risen from the dead , His disciples remembered that He said this . And so they believed and trusted and relied on the Scripture and the word ( message ) Jesus had spoken . ( E )
AMPC	John	2	23	But when He was in Jerusalem during the Passover Feast , many believed in His name [ identified themselves with His party ] after seeing His signs ( wonders , miracles ) which He was doing .
AMPC	John	2	24	But Jesus [ for His part ] did not trust Himself to them , because He knew all [ men ] ;
AMPC	John	2	25	And He did not need anyone to bear witness concerning man [ needed no evidence from anyone about men ] , for He Himself knew what was in human nature .

AMPC	John	3	3	Jesus answered him , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that unless a person is born again ( anew , from above ) , he can not ever see ( know , be acquainted with , and experience ) the kingdom of God .
AMPC	John	3	2	Who came to Jesus at night and said to Him , Rabbi , we know and are certain that You have come from God [ as ] a Teacher ; for no one can do these signs ( these wonderworks , these miracles—and produce the proofs ) that You do unless God is with him .
AMPC	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to Him , How can a man be born when he is old ? Can he enter his mother ’ s womb again and be born ?
AMPC	John	3	5	Jesus answered , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , unless a man is born of water and [ [ a ] even ] the Spirit , he can not [ ever ] enter the kingdom of God . ( A )
AMPC	John	3	6	What is born of [ from ] the flesh is flesh [ of the physical is physical ] ; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
AMPC	John	3	7	Marvel not [ do not be surprised , astonished ] at My telling you , You must all be born anew ( from above ) .
AMPC	John	3	8	The wind blows ( breathes ) where it wills ; and though you hear its sound , yet you neither know where it comes from nor where it is going . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit .
AMPC	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered by asking , How can all this be possible ?
AMPC	John	3	10	Jesus replied , Are you the teacher of Israel , and yet do not know nor understand these things ? [ Are they strange to you ? ]
AMPC	John	3	11	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , We speak only of what we know [ we know absolutely what we are talking about ] ; we have actually seen what we are testifying to [ we were eyewitnesses of it ] . And still you do not receive our testimony [ you reject and refuse our evidence—that of Myself and of all those who are born of the Spirit ] .
AMPC	John	3	12	If I have told you of things that happen right here on the earth and yet none of you believes Me , how can you believe ( trust Me , adhere to Me , rely on Me ) if I tell you of heavenly things ?
AMPC	John	3	13	And yet no one has ever gone up to heaven , but there is One Who has come down from heaven—the Son of Man [ Himself ] , [ b ] Who is ( dwells , has His home ) in heaven .
AMPC	John	3	14	And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert [ on a pole ] , so must [ so it is necessary that ] the Son of Man be lifted up [ on the cross ] , ( B )
AMPC	John	3	15	In order that everyone who believes in Him [ who cleaves to Him , trusts Him , and relies on Him ] may [ c ] not perish , but have eternal life and [ actually ] live forever !
AMPC	John	3	16	For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [ even ] gave up His only begotten ( [ d ] unique ) Son , so that whoever believes in ( trusts in , clings to , relies on ) Him shall not perish ( come to destruction , be lost ) but have eternal ( everlasting ) life .
AMPC	John	3	17	For God did not send the Son into the world in order to judge ( to reject , to condemn , to pass sentence on ) the world , but that the world might find salvation and be made safe and sound through Him .
AMPC	John	3	18	He who believes in Him [ who clings to , trusts in , relies on Him ] is not judged [ he who trusts in Him never comes up for judgment ; for him there is no rejection , no condemnation—he incurs no damnation ] ; but he who does not believe ( cleave to , rely on , trust in Him ) is judged already [ he has already been convicted and has already received his sentence ] because he has not believed in and trusted in the name of the only begotten Son of God . [ He is condemned for refusing to let his trust rest in Christ ’ s name . ]
AMPC	John	3	19	The [ basis of the ] judgment ( indictment , the test by which men are judged , the ground for the sentence ) lies in this : the Light has come into the world , and people have loved the darkness rather than and more than the Light , for their works ( deeds ) were evil . ( C )
AMPC	John	3	20	For every wrongdoer hates ( loathes , detests ) the Light , and will not come out into the Light but shrinks from it , lest his works ( his deeds , his activities , his conduct ) be exposed and reproved .
AMPC	John	3	21	But he who practices truth [ who does what is right ] comes out into the Light ; so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—wrought with God [ divinely prompted , done with God ’ s help , in dependence upon Him ] .
AMPC	John	3	22	After this , Jesus and His disciples went into the land ( the countryside ) of Judea , where He remained with them , and baptized .
AMPC	John	3	23	But John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim , for there was an abundance of water there , and the people kept coming and being baptized .
AMPC	John	3	24	For John had not yet been thrown into prison .
AMPC	John	3	25	Therefore there arose a controversy between some of John ’ s disciples and a Jew in regard to purification .
AMPC	John	3	26	So they came to John and reported to him , Rabbi , the Man Who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [ [ e ] at the Jordan crossing ] —and to Whom you yourself have borne testimony—notice , here He is baptizing too , and everybody is flocking to Him !
AMPC	John	3	27	John answered , A man can receive nothing [ he can claim nothing , he can [ f ] take unto himself nothing ] except as it has been granted to him from heaven . [ A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from heaven ; there is no other source . ]
AMPC	John	3	28	You yourselves are my witnesses [ you personally bear me out ] that I stated , I am not the Christ ( the Anointed One , the Messiah ) , but I have [ only ] been sent before Him [ in advance of Him , to be His appointed forerunner , His messenger , His announcer ] . ( D )
AMPC	John	3	29	He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the groomsman who stands by and listens to him rejoices greatly and heartily on account of the bridegroom ’ s voice . This then is my pleasure and joy , and it is now complete . ( E )
AMPC	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease . [ He must grow more prominent ; I must grow less so . ] ( F )
AMPC	John	3	31	He Who comes from above ( heaven ) is [ far ] above all [ others ] ; he who comes from the earth belongs to the earth , and talks the language of earth [ his words are from an earthly standpoint ] . He Who comes from heaven is [ far ] above all others [ far superior to all others in prominence and in excellence ] .
AMPC	John	3	32	It is to what He has [ actually ] seen and heard that He bears testimony , and yet no one accepts His testimony [ no one receives His evidence as true ] .
AMPC	John	3	33	Whoever receives His testimony has set his seal of approval to this : God is true . [ That man has definitely certified , acknowledged , declared once and for all , and is himself assured that it is divine truth that God can not lie ] .
AMPC	John	3	34	For since He Whom God has sent speaks the words of God [ proclaims God ’ s own message ] , God does not give Him His Spirit sparingly or by measure , but boundless is the gift God makes of His Spirit ! ( G )
AMPC	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given ( entrusted , committed ) everything into His hand . ( H )
AMPC	John	3	36	And he who believes in ( has faith in , clings to , relies on ) the Son has ( now possesses ) eternal life . But whoever disobeys ( is unbelieving toward , refuses to trust in , disregards , is not subject to ) the Son will never see ( experience ) life , but [ instead ] the wrath of God abides on him . [ God ’ s displeasure remains on him ; His indignation hangs over him continually . ] ( I ) Footnotes - John 3:5 The Greek “ kai ” ( “ and ” ) may be rendered “ even. ” - John 3:13 Some manuscripts add this phrase . - John 3:15 Some manuscripts add this phrase . - John 3:16 James Moulton and George Milligan , The Vocabulary . - John 3:26 George M.

AMPC	John	4	4	It was necessary for Him to go through Samaria .
AMPC	John	4	2	Though Jesus Himself did not baptize , but His disciples—
AMPC	John	4	3	He left Judea and returned to Galilee .
AMPC	John	4	5	And in doing so , He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar , near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
AMPC	John	4	6	And Jacob ’ s well was there . So Jesus , tired as He was from His journey , sat down [ to rest ] by the well . It was then about the sixth hour ( about noon ) .
AMPC	John	4	7	Presently , when a woman of Samaria came along to draw water , Jesus said to her , Give Me a drink—
AMPC	John	4	8	For His disciples had gone off into the town to buy food—
AMPC	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman said to Him , How is it that [ a ] You , being a Jew , ask me , a Samaritan [ and a ] woman , for a drink ? —For the Jews have nothing to do with the Samaritans—
AMPC	John	4	10	Jesus answered her , If you had only known and had recognized God ’ s gift and Who this is that is saying to you , Give Me a drink , you would have asked Him [ instead ] and He would have given you living water .
AMPC	John	4	11	She said to Him , Sir , You have nothing to draw with [ no drawing bucket ] and the well is deep ; how then can You provide living water ? [ Where do You get Your living water ? ]
AMPC	John	4	12	Are You greater than and superior to our ancestor Jacob , who gave us this well and who used to drink from it himself , and his sons and his cattle also ?
AMPC	John	4	13	Jesus answered her , All who drink of this water will be thirsty again .
AMPC	John	4	14	But whoever takes a drink of the water that I will give him shall never , no never , be thirsty any more . But the water that I will give him shall become a spring of water welling up ( flowing , bubbling ) [ continually ] within him unto ( into , for ) eternal life .
AMPC	John	4	15	The woman said to Him , Sir , give me this water , so that I may never get thirsty nor have to come [ continually all the way ] here to draw .
AMPC	John	4	16	At this , Jesus said to her , Go , call your husband and come back here .
AMPC	John	4	17	The woman answered , I have no husband . Jesus said to her , You have spoken truly in saying , I have no husband .
AMPC	John	4	18	For you have had five husbands , and the man you are now living with is not your husband . In this you have spoken truly .
AMPC	John	4	19	The woman said to Him , Sir , I see and understand that You are a prophet .
AMPC	John	4	20	Our forefathers worshiped on this mountain , but you [ Jews ] say that Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary and proper to worship .
AMPC	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , Woman , believe Me , a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither [ merely ] in this mountain nor [ merely ] in Jerusalem .
AMPC	John	4	22	You [ Samaritans ] do not know what you are worshiping [ you worship what you do not comprehend ] . We do know what we are worshiping [ we worship what we have knowledge of and understand ] , for [ after all ] salvation comes from [ among ] the Jews .
AMPC	John	4	23	A time will come , however , indeed it is already here , when the true ( genuine ) worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth ( reality ) ; for the Father is seeking just such people as these as His worshipers .
AMPC	John	4	24	God is a Spirit ( a spiritual Being ) and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth ( reality ) .
AMPC	John	4	25	The woman said to Him , I know that Messiah is coming , He Who is called the Christ ( the Anointed One ) ; and when He arrives , He will tell us everything we need to know and make it clear to us .
AMPC	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , I Who now speak with you am He .
AMPC	John	4	27	Just then His disciples came and they wondered ( were surprised , astonished ) to find Him talking with a woman [ a married woman ] . However , not one of them asked Him , What are You inquiring about ? or What do You want ? or , Why do You speak with her ?
AMPC	John	4	28	Then the woman left her water jar and went away to the town . And she began telling the people ,
AMPC	John	4	29	Come , see a Man Who has told me everything that I ever did ! Can this be [ is not this ] the Christ ? [ Must not this be the Messiah , the Anointed One ? ]
AMPC	John	4	30	So the people left the town and set out to go to Him .
AMPC	John	4	31	Meanwhile , the disciples urged Him saying , Rabbi , eat something .
AMPC	John	4	32	But He assured them , I have food ( nourishment ) to eat of which you know nothing and have no idea .
AMPC	John	4	33	So the disciples said one to another , Has someone brought Him something to eat ?
AMPC	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , My food ( nourishment ) is to do the will ( pleasure ) of Him Who sent Me and to accomplish and completely finish His work .
AMPC	John	4	35	Do you not say , It is still four months until harvest time comes ? Look ! I tell you , raise your eyes and observe the fields and see how they are already white for harvesting .
AMPC	John	4	36	Already the reaper is getting his wages [ he who does the cutting now has his reward ] , for he is gathering fruit ( crop ) unto life eternal , so that he who does the planting and he who does the reaping may rejoice together .
AMPC	John	4	37	For in this the saying holds true , One sows and another reaps .
AMPC	John	4	38	I sent you to reap a crop for which you have not toiled . Other men have labored and you have stepped in to reap the results of their work .
AMPC	John	4	39	Now numerous Samaritans from that town believed in and trusted in Him because of what the woman said when she declared and testified , He told me everything that I ever did .
AMPC	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans arrived , they asked Him to remain with them , and He did stay there two days .
AMPC	John	4	41	Then many more believed in and adhered to and relied on Him because of His personal message [ what He Himself said ] .
AMPC	John	4	42	And they told the woman , Now we no longer believe ( trust , have faith ) just because of what you said ; for we have heard Him ourselves [ personally ] , and we know that He truly is the Savior of the world , the Christ .
AMPC	John	4	43	But after these two days Jesus went on from there into Galilee—
AMPC	John	4	44	Although He Himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country .
AMPC	John	4	45	However , when He came into Galilee , the Galileans also welcomed Him and took Him to their hearts eagerly , for they had seen everything that He did in Jerusalem during the Feast ; for they too had attended the Feast .
AMPC	John	4	46	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee , where He had turned the water into wine . And there was a certain royal official whose son was lying ill in Capernaum .
AMPC	John	4	47	Having heard that Jesus had come back from Judea into Galilee , he went away to meet Him and began to beg Him to come down and cure his son , for he was lying at the point of death .
AMPC	John	4	48	Then Jesus said to him , Unless you see signs and miracles happen , you [ people ] never will believe ( trust , have faith ) at all .
AMPC	John	4	49	The king ’ s officer pleaded with Him , Sir , do come down at once before my little child is dead !
AMPC	John	4	50	Jesus answered him , Go in peace ; your son will live ! And the man put his trust in what Jesus said and started home .
AMPC	John	4	51	But even as he was on the road going down , his servants met him and reported , saying , Your son lives !
AMPC	John	4	52	So he asked them at what time he had begun to get better . They said , Yesterday during the seventh hour ( about one o ’ clock in the afternoon ) the fever left him .
AMPC	John	4	53	Then the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him , Your son will live . And he and his entire household believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Jesus ) .
AMPC	John	4	54	This is the second sign ( wonderwork , miracle ) that Jesus performed after He had come out of Judea into Galilee . Footnotes - John 4:9 Capitalized because of what He is , the spotless Son of God , not what the speaker may have thought He was . Copyright ©

AMPC	John	5	5	There was a certain man there who had suffered with a deep-seated and lingering disorder for thirty-eight years .
AMPC	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep Gate . This pool in the Hebrew is called Bethesda , having five porches ( alcoves , colonnades , doorways ) .
AMPC	John	5	3	In these lay a great number of sick folk—some blind , some crippled , and some paralyzed ( shriveled up ) — [ a ] waiting for the bubbling up of the water .
AMPC	John	5	4	For an angel of the Lord went down at appointed seasons into the pool and moved and stirred up the water ; whoever then first , after the stirring up of the water , stepped in was cured of whatever disease with which he was afflicted .
AMPC	John	5	6	When Jesus noticed him lying there [ helpless ] , knowing that he had already been a long time in that condition , He said to him , Do you want to become well ? [ Are you really in earnest about getting well ? ]
AMPC	John	5	7	The invalid answered , Sir , I have nobody when the water is moving to put me into the pool ; but while I am trying to come [ into it ] myself , somebody else steps down ahead of me .
AMPC	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , Get up ! Pick up your bed ( sleeping pad ) and walk !
AMPC	John	5	9	Instantly the man became well and recovered his strength and picked up his bed and walked . But that happened on the Sabbath .
AMPC	John	5	10	So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed , It is the Sabbath , and you have no right to pick up your bed [ it is not lawful ] .
AMPC	John	5	11	He answered them , The [ b ] Man Who healed me and gave me back my strength , He Himself said to me , Pick up your bed and walk !
AMPC	John	5	12	They asked him , Who is the Man Who told you , Pick up your bed and walk ?
AMPC	John	5	13	Now the invalid who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had quietly gone away [ had passed on unnoticed ] , since there was a crowd in the place .
AMPC	John	5	14	Afterward , when Jesus found him in the temple , He said to him , See , you are well ! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you .
AMPC	John	5	15	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus Who had made him well .
AMPC	John	5	16	For this reason the Jews began to persecute ( annoy , torment ) Jesus [ c ] and sought to kill Him , because He was doing these things on the Sabbath .
AMPC	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , My Father has worked [ even ] until now , [ He has never ceased working ; He is still working ] and I , too , must be at [ divine ] work .
AMPC	John	5	18	This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him [ to do away with Him ] ; because He not only was breaking ( weakening , violating ) the Sabbath , but He actually was speaking of God as being [ in a special sense ] His own Father , making Himself equal [ putting Himself on a level ] with God .
AMPC	John	5	19	So Jesus answered them by saying , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , the Son is able to do nothing of Himself ( of His own accord ) ; but He is able to do only what He sees the Father doing , for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the same way [ in His turn ] .
AMPC	John	5	20	The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to ( shows ) Him everything that He Himself does . And He will disclose to Him ( let Him see ) greater things yet than these , so that you may marvel and be full of wonder and astonishment .
AMPC	John	5	21	Just as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life [ makes them live on ] , even so the Son also gives life to whomever He wills and is pleased to give it .
AMPC	John	5	22	Even the Father judges no one , for He has given all judgment ( the last judgment and the whole business of judging ) entirely into the hands of the Son ,
AMPC	John	5	23	So that all men may give honor ( reverence , homage ) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father . [ In fact ] whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father , Who has sent Him .
AMPC	John	5	24	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , the person whose ears are open to My words [ who listens to My message ] and believes and trusts in and clings to and relies on Him Who sent Me has ( possesses now ) eternal life . And he does not come into judgment [ does not incur sentence of judgment , will not come under condemnation ] , but he has already passed over out of death into life .
AMPC	John	5	25	Believe Me when I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , the time is coming and is here now when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear it shall live .
AMPC	John	5	26	For even as the Father has life in Himself and is self-existent , so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself and be self-existent .
AMPC	John	5	27	And He has given Him authority and granted Him power to execute ( exercise , practice ) judgment because He is [ d ] a Son of man [ very man ] .
AMPC	John	5	28	Do not be surprised and wonder at this , for the time is coming when all those who are in the tombs shall hear His voice ,
AMPC	John	5	29	And they shall come out—those who have practiced doing good [ will come out ] to the resurrection of [ new ] life , and those who have done evil will be raised for judgment [ raised to meet their sentence ] . ( A )
AMPC	John	5	30	I am able to do nothing from Myself [ independently , of My own accord—but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders ] . Even as I hear , I judge [ I decide as I am bidden to decide . As the voice comes to Me , so I give a decision ] , and My judgment is right ( just , righteous ) , because I do not seek or consult My own will [ I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself , My own aim , My own purpose ] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	5	31	If I alone testify in My behalf , My testimony is not valid and can not be worth anything .
AMPC	John	5	32	There is Another Who testifies concerning Me , and I know and am certain that His evidence on My behalf is true and valid .
AMPC	John	5	33	You yourselves have sent [ an inquiry ] to John and he has been a witness to the truth .
AMPC	John	5	34	But I do not receive [ a mere ] human witness [ the evidence which I accept on My behalf is not from man ] ; but I simply mention all these things in order that you may be saved ( made and kept safe and sound ) .
AMPC	John	5	35	John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [ to show you the way ] , and you were willing for a while to delight ( sun ) yourselves in his light .
AMPC	John	5	36	But I have as My witness something greater ( weightier , higher , better ) than that of John ; for the works that the Father has appointed Me to accomplish and finish , the very same works that I am now doing , are a witness and proof that the Father has sent Me .
AMPC	John	5	37	And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me . Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form ( His face—what He is like ) . [ You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him . ]
AMPC	John	5	38	And you have not His word ( His thought ) living in your hearts , because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent . [ That is why you do not keep His message living in you , because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent . ]
AMPC	John	5	39	You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently , because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them . And these [ very Scriptures ] testify about Me !
AMPC	John	5	40	And still you are not willing [ but refuse ] to come to Me , so that you might have life .
AMPC	John	5	41	I receive not glory from men [ I crave no human honor , I look for no mortal fame ] ,
AMPC	John	5	42	But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you .
AMPC	John	5	43	I have come in My Father ’ s name and with His power , and you do not receive Me [ your hearts are not open to Me , you give Me no welcome ] ; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself , you will receive him and give him your approval .
AMPC	John	5	44	How is it possible for you to believe [ how can you learn to believe ] , you who [ are content to seek and ] receive praise and honor and glory from one another , and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God ?
AMPC	John	5	45	Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [ as some of you are supposing ] that I will accuse you before the Father . There is one who accuses you—it is Moses , the very one on whom you have built your hopes [ in whom you trust ] .
AMPC	John	5	46	For if you believed and relied on Moses , you would believe and rely on Me , for he wrote about Me [ personally ] .
AMPC	John	5	47	But if you do not believe and trust his writings , how then will you believe and trust My teachings ? [ How shall you cleave to and rely on My words ? ] Copyright ©

AMPC	John	6	6	But He said this to prove ( test ) him , for He well knew what He was about to do .
AMPC	John	6	2	And a great crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs ( miracles ) which He [ continually ] performed upon those who were sick .
AMPC	John	6	3	And Jesus walked up the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples .
AMPC	John	6	4	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was approaching .
AMPC	John	6	5	Jesus looked up then , and seeing that a vast multitude was coming toward Him , He said to Philip , Where are we to buy bread , so that all these people may eat ?
AMPC	John	6	7	Philip answered Him , Two hundred pennies ’ ( forty dollars ) worth of bread is not enough that everyone may receive even a little .
AMPC	John	6	8	Another of His disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , said to Him ,
AMPC	John	6	9	There is a little boy here , who has [ with him ] five barley loaves , and two small fish ; but what are they among so many people ?
AMPC	John	6	10	Jesus said , Make all the people recline ( sit down ) . Now the ground ( a pasture ) was covered with thick grass at the spot , so the men threw themselves down , about 5,000 in number .
AMPC	John	6	11	Jesus took the loaves , and when He had given thanks , He distributed [ a ] to the disciples and the disciples to the reclining people ; so also [ He did ] with the fish , as much as they wanted .
AMPC	John	6	12	When they had all had enough , He said to His disciples , Gather up now the fragments ( the broken pieces that are left over ) , so that nothing may be lost and wasted .
AMPC	John	6	13	So accordingly they gathered them up , and they filled twelve [ [ b ] small hand ] baskets with fragments left over by those who had eaten from the five barley loaves .
AMPC	John	6	14	When the people saw the sign ( miracle ) that Jesus had performed , they began saying , Surely and beyond a doubt this is the Prophet Who is to come into the world ! ( A )
AMPC	John	6	15	Then Jesus , knowing that they meant to come and seize Him that they might make Him king , withdrew again to the hillside by Himself alone .
AMPC	John	6	16	When evening came , His disciples went down to the sea ,
AMPC	John	6	17	And they took a boat and were going across the sea to Capernaum . It was now dark , and still Jesus had not [ yet ] come back to them .
AMPC	John	6	18	Meanwhile , the sea was getting rough and rising high because of a great and violent wind that was blowing .
AMPC	John	6	19	[ However ] when they had rowed three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat . And they were afraid ( terrified ) .
AMPC	John	6	20	But Jesus said to them , It is I ; be not afraid ! [ I Am ; stop being frightened ! ] ( B )
AMPC	John	6	21	Then they were quite willing and glad for Him to come into the boat . And now the boat went at once to the land they had steered toward . [ And immediately they reached the shore toward which they had been slowly making their way . ]
AMPC	John	6	22	The next day the crowd [ that still remained ] standing on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there , and that Jesus had not gone into it with His disciples , but that His disciples had gone away by themselves .
AMPC	John	6	23	But now some other boats from Tiberias had come in near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
AMPC	John	6	24	So the people , finding that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there , themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
AMPC	John	6	25	And when they found Him on the other side of the lake , they said to Him , Rabbi ! When did You come here ?
AMPC	John	6	26	Jesus answered them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , you have been searching for Me , not because you saw the miracles and signs but because you were fed with the loaves and were filled and satisfied .
AMPC	John	6	27	Stop toiling and doing and producing for the food that perishes and decomposes [ in the using ] , but strive and work and produce rather for the [ lasting ] food which endures [ continually ] unto life eternal ; the Son of Man will give ( furnish ) you that , for God the Father has authorized and certified Him and put His seal of endorsement upon Him .
AMPC	John	6	28	They then said , What are we to do , that we may [ habitually ] be working the works of God ? [ What are we to do to carry out what God requires ? ]
AMPC	John	6	29	Jesus replied , This is the work ( service ) that God asks of you : that you believe in the One Whom He has sent [ that you cleave to , trust , rely on , and have faith in His Messenger ] .
AMPC	John	6	30	Therefore they said to Him , What sign ( miracle , wonderwork ) will [ c ] You perform then , so that we may see it and believe and rely on and adhere to You ? What [ supernatural ] work have You [ to show what You can do ] ?
AMPC	John	6	31	Our forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as the Scripture says , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . ( C )
AMPC	John	6	32	Jesus then said to them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , Moses did not give you the Bread from heaven [ what Moses gave you was not the Bread from heaven ] , but it is My Father Who gives you the true heavenly Bread .
AMPC	John	6	33	For the Bread of God is He Who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world .
AMPC	John	6	34	Then they said to Him , Lord , give us this bread always ( all the time ) !
AMPC	John	6	35	Jesus replied , I am the Bread of Life . He who comes to Me will never be hungry , and he who believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me will never thirst any more ( at any time ) .
AMPC	John	6	36	But [ as ] I told you , although you have seen Me , still you do not believe and trust and have faith .
AMPC	John	6	37	All whom My Father gives ( entrusts ) to Me will come to Me ; and the one who comes to Me I will most certainly not cast out [ I will never , no never , reject one of them who comes to Me ] .
AMPC	John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will and purpose but to do the will and purpose of Him Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	6	39	And this is the will of Him Who sent Me , that I should not lose any of all that He has given Me , but that I should give new life and raise [ them all ] up at the last day .
AMPC	John	6	40	For this is My Father ’ s will and His purpose , that everyone who sees the Son and believes in and cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Him should have eternal life , and I will raise him up [ from the dead ] at the last day .
AMPC	John	6	41	Now the Jews murmured and found fault with and grumbled about Jesus because He said , I am [ Myself ] the Bread that came down from heaven .
AMPC	John	6	42	They kept asking , Is not this Jesus , the [ d ] Son of Joseph , Whose father and mother we know ? How then can He say , I have come down from heaven ?
AMPC	John	6	43	So Jesus answered them , Stop grumbling and saying things against Me to one another .
AMPC	John	6	44	No one is able to come to Me unless the Father Who sent Me attracts and draws him and gives him the desire to come to Me , and [ then ] I will raise him up [ from the dead ] at the last day .
AMPC	John	6	45	It is written in [ the book of ] the Prophets , And they shall all be taught of God [ have Him in person for their Teacher ] . Everyone who has listened to and learned from the Father comes to Me— ( D )
AMPC	John	6	46	Which does not imply that anyone has seen the Father [ not that anyone has ever seen Him ] except He [ Who was with the Father ] Who comes from God ; He [ alone ] has seen the Father .
AMPC	John	6	47	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , he who believes in Me [ who adheres to , trusts in , relies on , and has faith in Me ] has ( now possesses ) eternal life .
AMPC	John	6	48	I am the Bread of Life [ that gives life—the Living Bread ] .
AMPC	John	6	49	Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and [ yet ] they died .
AMPC	John	6	50	[ But ] this is the Bread that comes down from heaven , so that [ any ] one may eat of it and never die .
AMPC	John	6	51	I [ Myself ] am this Living Bread that came down from heaven . If anyone eats of this Bread , he will live forever ; and also the Bread that I shall give for the life of the world is My flesh ( body ) .
AMPC	John	6	52	Then the Jews angrily contended with one another , saying , How is He able to give us His flesh to eat ?
AMPC	John	6	53	And Jesus said to them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , you can not have any life in you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [ unless you appropriate His life and the saving merit of His blood ] .
AMPC	John	6	54	He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood has ( possesses now ) eternal life , and I will raise him up [ from the dead ] on the last day .
AMPC	John	6	55	For My flesh is true and genuine food , and My blood is true and genuine drink .
AMPC	John	6	56	He who feeds on My flesh and drinks My blood dwells continually in Me , and I [ in like manner dwell continually ] in him .
AMPC	John	6	57	Just as the living Father sent Me and I live by ( through , because of ) the Father , even so whoever continues to feed on Me [ whoever takes Me for his food and is nourished by Me ] shall [ in his turn ] live through and because of Me .
AMPC	John	6	58	This is the Bread that came down from heaven . It is not like the manna which our forefathers ate , and yet died ; he who takes this Bread for his food shall live forever .
AMPC	John	6	59	He said these things in a synagogue while He was teaching at Capernaum .
AMPC	John	6	60	When His disciples heard this , many of them said , This is a hard and difficult and strange saying ( an offensive and unbearable message ) . Who can stand to hear it ? [ Who can be expected to listen to such teaching ? ]
AMPC	John	6	61	But Jesus , knowing within Himself that His disciples were complaining and protesting and grumbling about it , said to them : Is this a stumbling block and an offense to you ? [ Does this upset and displease and shock and scandalize you ? ]
AMPC	John	6	62	What then [ will be your reaction ] if you should see the Son of Man ascending to [ the place ] where He was before ?
AMPC	John	6	63	It is the Spirit Who gives life [ He is the Life-giver ] ; the flesh conveys no benefit whatever [ there is no profit in it ] . The words ( truths ) that I have been speaking to you are spirit and life .
AMPC	John	6	64	But [ still ] some of you fail to believe and trust and have faith . For Jesus knew from the first who did not believe and had no faith and who would betray Him and be false to Him .
AMPC	John	6	65	And He said , This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless it is granted him [ unless he is enabled to do so ] by the Father .
AMPC	John	6	66	After this , many of His disciples drew back ( returned to their old associations ) and no longer accompanied Him .
AMPC	John	6	67	Jesus said to the Twelve , Will you also go away ? [ And do you too desire to leave Me ? ]
AMPC	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered , Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words ( the message ) of eternal life .
AMPC	John	6	69	And we have learned to believe and trust , and [ more ] we have come to know [ surely ] that You are the Holy One of God , the Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the Son of the living God .
AMPC	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , Did I not choose you , the Twelve ? And [ yet ] one of you is a devil ( of the evil one and a false accuser ) .
AMPC	John	6	71	He was speaking of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot , for he was about to betray Him , [ although ] he was one of the Twelve .

AMPC	John	7	7	The world can not [ be expected to ] hate you , but it does hate Me because I denounce it for its wicked works and reveal that its doings are evil .
AMPC	John	7	2	Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was drawing near .
AMPC	John	7	3	So His brothers said to Him , Leave here and go into Judea , so that [ a ] Your disciples [ there ] may also see the works that You do . [ This is no place for You . ]
AMPC	John	7	4	For no one does anything in secret when he wishes to be conspicuous and secure publicity . If You [ must ] do these things [ if You must act like this ] , show Yourself openly and make Yourself known to the world !
AMPC	John	7	5	For [ even ] His brothers did not believe in or adhere to or trust in or rely on Him either .
AMPC	John	7	6	Whereupon Jesus said to them , My time ( opportunity ) has not come yet ; but any time is suitable for you and your opportunity is ready any time [ is always here ] .
AMPC	John	7	8	Go to the Feast yourselves . I am not [ yet ] going up to the Festival , because My time is not ripe . [ My term is not yet completed ; it is not time for Me to go . ]
AMPC	John	7	9	Having said these things to them , He stayed behind in Galilee .
AMPC	John	7	10	But afterward , when His brothers had gone up to the Feast , He went up also , not publicly [ not with a caravan ] , but by Himself quietly and as if He did not wish to be observed .
AMPC	John	7	11	Therefore the Jews kept looking for Him at the Feast and asking , Where can He be ? [ Where is that Fellow ? ]
AMPC	John	7	12	And there was among the mass of the people much whispered discussion and hot disputing about Him . Some were saying , He is good ! [ He is a good Man ! ] Others said , No , He misleads and deceives the people [ gives them false ideas ] !
AMPC	John	7	13	But no one dared speak out boldly about Him for fear of [ the leaders of ] the Jews .
AMPC	John	7	14	When the Feast was already half over , Jesus went up into the temple [ [ b ] court ] and began to teach .
AMPC	John	7	15	The Jews were astonished . They said , How is it that this Man has learning [ is so versed in the sacred Scriptures and in theology ] when He has never studied ?
AMPC	John	7	16	Jesus answered them by saying , My teaching is not My own , but His Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	7	17	If any man desires to do His will ( God ’ s pleasure ) , he will know ( have the needed illumination to recognize , and can tell for himself ) whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking from Myself and of My own accord and on My own authority .
AMPC	John	7	18	He who speaks on his own authority seeks to win honor for himself . [ He whose teaching originates with himself seeks his own glory . ] But He Who seeks the glory and is eager for the honor of Him Who sent Him , He is true ; and there is no unrighteousness or falsehood or deception in Him .
AMPC	John	7	19	Did not Moses give you the Law ? And yet not one of you keeps the Law . [ If that is the truth ] why do you seek to kill Me [ for not keeping it ] ?
AMPC	John	7	20	The crowd answered Him , You are possessed by a demon ! [ You are raving ! ] Who seeks to kill You ?
AMPC	John	7	21	Jesus answered them , I did one work , and you all are astounded . ( A )
AMPC	John	7	22	Now Moses established circumcision among you—though it did not originate with Moses but with the previous patriarchs—and you circumcise a person [ even ] on the Sabbath day .
AMPC	John	7	23	If , to avoid breaking the Law of Moses , a person undergoes circumcision on the Sabbath day , have you any cause to be angry with ( indignant with , bitter against ) Me for making a man ’ s whole body well on the Sabbath ?
AMPC	John	7	24	Be honest in your judgment and do not decide at a glance ( superficially and by appearances ) ; but judge fairly and righteously .
AMPC	John	7	25	Then some of the Jerusalem people said , Is not this the Man they seek to kill ?
AMPC	John	7	26	And here He is speaking openly , and they say nothing to Him ! Can it be possible that the rulers have discovered and know that this is truly the Christ ?
AMPC	John	7	27	No , we know where this Man comes from ; when the Christ arrives , no one is to know from what place He comes .
AMPC	John	7	28	Whereupon Jesus called out as He taught in the temple [ [ c ] porches ] , Do you know Me , and do you know where I am from ? I have not come on My own authority and of My own accord and as self-appointed , but the One Who sent Me is true ( real , genuine , steadfast ) ; and Him you do not know !
AMPC	John	7	29	I know Him [ Myself ] because I come from His [ very ] presence , and it was He [ personally ] Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	7	30	Therefore they were eager to arrest Him , but no one laid a hand on Him , for His hour ( time ) had not yet come .
AMPC	John	7	31	And besides , many of the multitude believed in Him [ adhered to Him , trusted in Him , relied on Him ] . And they kept saying , When the Christ comes , will He do [ can He be expected to do ] more miracles and produce more proofs and signs than what this Man has done ?
AMPC	John	7	32	The Pharisees learned how the people were saying these things about Him under their breath ; and the chief priests and Pharisees sent attendants ( guards ) to arrest Him .
AMPC	John	7	33	Therefore Jesus said , For a little while I am [ still ] with you , and then I go back to Him Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	7	34	You will look for Me , but you will not [ be able to ] find Me ; where I am , you can not come .
AMPC	John	7	35	Then the Jews said among themselves , Where does this Man intend to go that we shall not find Him ? Will He go to the Jews who are scattered in the Dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
AMPC	John	7	36	What does this statement of His mean , You will look for Me and not be able to find Me , and , Where I am , you can not come ?
AMPC	John	7	37	Now on the final and most important day of the Feast , Jesus stood , and He cried in a loud voice , If any man is thirsty , let him come to Me and drink !
AMPC	John	7	38	He who believes in Me [ who cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me ] as the Scripture has said , From his innermost being shall flow [ continuously ] springs and rivers of living water .
AMPC	John	7	39	But He was speaking here of the Spirit , Whom those who believed ( trusted , had faith ) in Him were afterward to receive . For the [ Holy ] Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus was not yet glorified ( raised to honor ) .
AMPC	John	7	40	Listening to those words , some of the multitude said , This is certainly and beyond doubt the Prophet ! ( B )
AMPC	John	7	41	Others said , This is the Christ ( the Messiah , Anointed One ) ! But some said , What ? Does the Christ come out of Galilee ?
AMPC	John	7	42	Does not the Scripture tell us that the Christ will come from the offspring of David and from Bethlehem , the village where David lived ? ( C )
AMPC	John	7	43	So there arose a division and dissension among the people concerning Him .
AMPC	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to arrest Him , but no one [ ventured and ] laid hands on Him .
AMPC	John	7	45	Meanwhile the attendants ( guards ) had gone back to the chief priests and Pharisees , who asked them , Why have you not brought Him here with you ?
AMPC	John	7	46	The attendants replied , Never has a man talked as this Man talks ! [ No mere man has ever spoken as He speaks ! ]
AMPC	John	7	47	The Pharisees said to them , Are you also deluded and led astray ? [ Are you also swept off your feet ? ]
AMPC	John	7	48	Has any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in Him ?
AMPC	John	7	49	As for this multitude ( rabble ) that does not know the Law , they are contemptible and doomed and accursed !
AMPC	John	7	50	Then Nicodemus , who came to Jesus before at night and was one of them , asked ,
AMPC	John	7	51	Does our Law convict a man without giving him a hearing and finding out what he has done ?
AMPC	John	7	52	They answered him , Are you too from Galilee ? Search [ the Scriptures yourself ] , and you will see that no prophet comes ( will rise to prominence ) from Galilee .
AMPC	John	7	53	[ d ] And they went [ back ] , each to his own house .

AMPC	John	8	8	Then He bent down and went on writing on the ground with His finger .
AMPC	John	8	2	Early in the morning ( at dawn ) , He came back into the temple [ [ a ] court ] , and the people came to Him in crowds . He sat down and was teaching them ,
AMPC	John	8	3	When the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery . They made her stand in the middle of the court and put the case before Him .
AMPC	John	8	4	Teacher , they said , This woman has been caught in the very act of adultery .
AMPC	John	8	5	Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such [ women—offenders ] shall be stoned to death . But what do You say [ to do with her—what is Your sentence ] ? ( A )
AMPC	John	8	6	This they said to try ( test ) Him , hoping they might find a charge on which to accuse Him . But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger .
AMPC	John	8	7	However , when they persisted with their question , He raised Himself up and said , Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her .
AMPC	John	8	9	They listened to Him , and then they began going out , conscience-stricken , one by one , from the oldest down to the last one of them , till Jesus was left alone , with the woman standing there before Him in the center of the court .
AMPC	John	8	10	When Jesus raised Himself up , He said to her , Woman , where are your accusers ? Has no man condemned you ?
AMPC	John	8	11	She answered , No one , Lord ! And Jesus said , I do not condemn you either . Go on your way and from now on sin no more .
AMPC	John	8	12	Once more Jesus addressed the crowd . He said , I am the Light of the world . He who follows Me will not be walking in the dark , but will have the Light which is Life .
AMPC	John	8	13	Whereupon the Pharisees told Him , You are testifying on Your own behalf ; Your testimony is not valid and is worthless .
AMPC	John	8	14	Jesus answered , Even if I do testify on My own behalf , My testimony is true and reliable and valid , for I know where I came from and where I am going ; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
AMPC	John	8	15	You [ set yourselves up to ] judge according to the flesh ( by what you see ) . [ You condemn by external , human standards . ] I do not [ set Myself up to ] judge or condemn or sentence anyone .
AMPC	John	8	16	Yet even if I do judge , My judgment is true [ My decision is right ] ; for I am not alone [ in making it ] , but [ there are two of Us ] I and the Father , Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	8	17	In your [ own ] Law it is written that the testimony ( evidence ) of two persons is reliable and valid . ( B )
AMPC	John	8	18	I am One [ of the Two ] bearing testimony concerning Myself ; and My Father , Who sent Me , He also testifies about Me .
AMPC	John	8	19	Then they said to Him , Where is this [ b ] Father of Yours ? Jesus answered , You know My Father as little as you know Me . If you knew Me , you would know My Father also .
AMPC	John	8	20	Jesus said these things in the treasury while He was teaching in the temple [ [ c ] court ] ; but no one ventured to arrest Him , because His hour had not yet come .
AMPC	John	8	21	Therefore He said again to them , I am going away , and you will be looking for Me , and you will die in ( under the curse of ) your sin . Where I am going , it is not possible for you to come .
AMPC	John	8	22	At this the Jews began to ask among themselves , Will He kill Himself ? Is that why He says , Where I am going , it is not possible for you to come ?
AMPC	John	8	23	He said to them , You are from below ; I am from above . You are of this world ( of this earthly order ) ; I am not of this world .
AMPC	John	8	24	That is why I told you that you will die in ( under the curse of ) your sins ; for if you do not believe that I am He [ Whom I claim to be—if you do not adhere to , trust in , and rely on Me ] , you will die in your sins .
AMPC	John	8	25	Then they said to Him , Who are You anyway ? Jesus replied , [ Why do I even speak to you ! ] I am exactly what I have been telling you from the first .
AMPC	John	8	26	I have much to say about you and to judge and condemn . But He Who sent Me is true ( reliable ) , and I tell the world [ only ] the things that I have heard from Him .
AMPC	John	8	27	They did not perceive ( know , understand ) that He was speaking to them about the Father .
AMPC	John	8	28	So Jesus added , When you have lifted up the Son of Man [ on the cross ] , you will realize ( know , understand ) that I am He [ for Whom you look ] and that I do nothing of Myself ( of My own accord or on My own authority ) , but I say [ exactly ] what My Father has taught Me .
AMPC	John	8	29	And He Who sent Me is ever with Me ; My Father has not left Me alone , for I always do what pleases Him .
AMPC	John	8	30	As He said these things , many believed in Him [ trusted , relied on , and adhered to Him ] .
AMPC	John	8	31	So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him , If you abide in My word [ hold fast to My teachings and live in accordance with them ] , you are truly My disciples .
AMPC	John	8	32	And you will know the Truth , and the Truth will set you free .
AMPC	John	8	33	They answered Him , We are Abraham ’ s offspring ( descendants ) and have never been in bondage to anybody . What do You mean by saying , You will be set free ?
AMPC	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , Whoever commits and practices sin is the slave of sin .
AMPC	John	8	35	Now a slave does not remain in a household permanently ( forever ) ; the son [ of the house ] does remain forever .
AMPC	John	8	36	So if the Son liberates you [ makes you free men ] , then you are really and unquestionably free .
AMPC	John	8	37	[ Yes ] I know that you are Abraham ’ s offspring ; yet you plan to kill Me , because My word has no entrance ( makes no progress , does not find any place ) in you .
AMPC	John	8	38	I tell the things which I have seen and learned at My Father ’ s side , and your actions also reflect what you have heard and learned from your father .
AMPC	John	8	39	They retorted , Abraham is our father . Jesus said , If you were [ truly ] Abraham ’ s children , then you would do the works of Abraham [ follow his example , do as Abraham did ] .
AMPC	John	8	40	But now [ instead ] you are wanting and seeking to kill Me , a Man Who has told you the truth which I have heard from God . This is not the way Abraham acted .
AMPC	John	8	41	You are doing the works of your [ own ] father . They said to Him , We are not illegitimate children and born out of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
AMPC	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , If God were your Father , you would love Me and respect Me and welcome Me gladly , for I proceeded ( came forth ) from God [ out of His very presence ] . I did not even come on My own authority or of My own accord ( as self-appointed ) ; but He sent Me .
AMPC	John	8	43	Why do you misunderstand what I say ? It is because you are unable to hear what I am saying . [ You can not bear to listen to My message ; your ears are shut to My teaching . ]
AMPC	John	8	44	You are of your father , the devil , and it is your will to practice the lusts and gratify the desires [ which are characteristic ] of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks a falsehood , he speaks what is natural to him , for he is a liar [ himself ] and the father of lies and of all that is false .
AMPC	John	8	45	But because I speak the truth , you do not believe Me [ do not trust Me , do not rely on Me , or adhere to Me ] .
AMPC	John	8	46	Who of you convicts Me of wrongdoing or finds Me guilty of sin ? Then if I speak truth , why do you not believe Me [ trust Me , rely on , and adhere to Me ] ?
AMPC	John	8	47	Whoever is of God listens to God . [ Those who belong to God hear the words of God . ] This is the reason that you do not listen [ to those words , to Me ] : because you do not belong to God and are not of God or in harmony with Him .
AMPC	John	8	48	The Jews answered Him , Are we not right when we say You are a Samaritan and that You have a demon [ that You are under the power of an evil spirit ] ?
AMPC	John	8	49	Jesus answered , I am not possessed by a demon . On the contrary , I honor and reverence My Father and you dishonor ( despise , vilify , and scorn ) Me .
AMPC	John	8	50	However , I am not in search of honor for Myself . [ I do not seek and am not aiming for My own glory . ] There is One Who [ looks after that ; He ] seeks [ My glory ] , and He is the Judge .
AMPC	John	8	51	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , if anyone observes My teaching [ lives in accordance with My message , keeps My word ] , he will by no means ever see and experience death .
AMPC	John	8	52	The Jews said to Him , Now we know that You are under the power of a demon ( [ d ] insane ) . Abraham died , and also the prophets , yet You say , If a man keeps My word , he will never taste of death into all eternity .
AMPC	John	8	53	Are You greater than our father Abraham ? He died , and all the prophets died ! Who do You make Yourself out to be ?
AMPC	John	8	54	Jesus answered , If I were to glorify Myself ( magnify , praise , and honor Myself ) , I would have no real glory , for My glory would be nothing and worthless . [ My honor must come to Me from My Father . ] It is My Father Who glorifies Me [ Who extols Me , magnifies , and praises Me ] , of Whom you say that He is your God .
AMPC	John	8	55	Yet you do not know Him or recognize Him and are not acquainted with Him , but I know Him . If I should say that I do not know Him , I would be a liar like you . But I know Him and keep His word [ obey His teachings , am faithful to His message ] .
AMPC	John	8	56	Your forefather Abraham was extremely happy at the hope and prospect of seeing My day ( My incarnation ) ; and he did see it and was delighted . ( C )
AMPC	John	8	57	Then the Jews said to Him , You are not yet fifty years old , and have You seen Abraham ?
AMPC	John	8	58	Jesus replied , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , before Abraham was born , I Am . ( D )
AMPC	John	8	59	So they took up stones to throw at Him , but Jesus , by mixing with the crowd , concealed Himself and went out of the temple [ [ e ] enclosure ] .

AMPC	John	9	9	Some said , It is he . Others said , No , but he looks very much like him . But he said , Yes , I am the man .
AMPC	John	9	2	His disciples asked Him , Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
AMPC	John	9	3	Jesus answered , It was not that this man or his parents sinned , but he was born blind in order that the workings of God should be manifested ( displayed and illustrated ) in him .
AMPC	John	9	4	We must work the works of Him Who sent Me and be busy with His business while it is daylight ; night is coming on , when no man can work .
AMPC	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , I am the world ’ s Light .
AMPC	John	9	6	When He had said this , He spat on the ground and made clay ( mud ) with His saliva , and He spread it [ as ointment ] on the man ’ s eyes .
AMPC	John	9	7	And He said to him , Go , wash in the Pool of Siloam—which means Sent . So he went and washed , and came back seeing .
AMPC	John	9	8	When the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar saw him , they said , Is not this the man who used to sit and beg ?
AMPC	John	9	10	So they said to him , How were your eyes opened ?
AMPC	John	9	11	He replied , The Man called Jesus made mud and smeared it on my eyes and said to me , Go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and I obtained my sight !
AMPC	John	9	12	They asked him , Where is He ? He said , I do not know .
AMPC	John	9	13	Then they conducted to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind .
AMPC	John	9	14	Now it was on the Sabbath day that Jesus mixed the mud and opened the man ’ s eyes .
AMPC	John	9	15	So now again the Pharisees asked him how he received his sight . And he said to them , He smeared mud on my eyes , and I washed , and now I see .
AMPC	John	9	16	Then some of the Pharisees said , This Man [ Jesus ] is not from God , because He does not observe the Sabbath . But others said , How can a man who is a sinner ( a bad man ) do such signs and miracles ? So there was a difference of opinion among them .
AMPC	John	9	17	Accordingly they said to the blind man again , What do you say about Him , seeing that He opened your eyes ? And he said , He is [ He must be ] a prophet !
AMPC	John	9	18	However , the Jews did not believe that he had [ really ] been blind and that he had received his sight until they called ( summoned ) the parents of the man .
AMPC	John	9	19	They asked them , Is this your son , whom you reported as having been born blind ? How then does he see now ?
AMPC	John	9	20	His parents answered , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind .
AMPC	John	9	21	But as to how he can now see , we do not know ; or who has opened his eyes , we do not know . He is of age . Ask him ; let him speak for himself and give his own account of it .
AMPC	John	9	22	His parents said this because they feared [ the leaders of ] the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ , he should be expelled and excluded from the synagogue .
AMPC	John	9	23	On that account his parents said , He is of age ; ask him .
AMPC	John	9	24	So the second time they summoned the man who had been born blind , and said to him , Now give God the glory ( praise ) . This [ a ] Fellow we know is only a sinner ( a wicked person ) .
AMPC	John	9	25	Then he answered , I do not know whether He is a sinner and wicked or not . But one thing I do know , that whereas I was blind before , now I see .
AMPC	John	9	26	So they said to him , What did He [ actually ] do to you ? How did He open your eyes ?
AMPC	John	9	27	He answered , I already told you and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Can it be that you wish to become His disciples also ?
AMPC	John	9	28	And they stormed at him [ they jeered , they sneered , they reviled him ] and retorted , You are His disciple yourself , but we are the disciples of Moses .
AMPC	John	9	29	We know for certain that God spoke with Moses , but as for this Fellow , we know nothing about where He hails from .
AMPC	John	9	30	The man replied , Well , this is astonishing ! Here a Man has opened my eyes , and yet you do not know where He comes from . [ That is amazing ! ]
AMPC	John	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners ; but if anyone is God-fearing and a worshiper of Him and does His will , He listens to him .
AMPC	John	9	32	Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind .
AMPC	John	9	33	If this Man were not from God , He would not be able to do anything like this .
AMPC	John	9	34	They retorted , You were wholly born in sin [ from head to foot ] ; and do you [ presume to ] teach us ? So they cast him out [ threw him clear outside the synagogue ] .
AMPC	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had put him out , and meeting him He said , Do you believe in and adhere to the Son of Man [ b ] or the Son of God ?
AMPC	John	9	36	He answered , Who is He , Sir ? Tell me , that I may believe in and adhere to Him .
AMPC	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , You have seen Him ; [ in fact ] He is talking to you right now .
AMPC	John	9	38	He called out , Lord , I believe ! [ I rely on , I trust , I cleave to You ! ] And he worshiped Him .
AMPC	John	9	39	Then Jesus said , I came into this world for judgment [ as a Separator , in order that there may be [ c ] separation between those who believe on Me and those who reject Me ] , to make the sightless see and to make those who see become blind .
AMPC	John	9	40	Some Pharisees who were near , hearing this remark , said to Him , Are we also blind ?
AMPC	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but because you now claim to have sight , your sin remains . [ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin ; but because you insist , We do see clearly , you are unable to escape your guilt . ] Copyright ©

AMPC	John	10	10	The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy . I came that they may have and enjoy life , and have it in abundance ( to the full , till it [ b ] overflows ) .
AMPC	John	10	2	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
AMPC	John	10	3	The watchman opens the door for this man , and the sheep listen to his voice and heed it ; and he calls his own sheep by name and brings ( leads ) them out .
AMPC	John	10	4	When he has brought his own sheep outside , he walks on before them , and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
AMPC	John	10	5	They will never [ on any account ] follow a stranger , but will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers or recognize their call .
AMPC	John	10	6	Jesus used this parable ( illustration ) with them , but they did not understand what He was talking about .
AMPC	John	10	7	So Jesus said again , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that I Myself am the Door [ a ] for the sheep .
AMPC	John	10	8	All others who came [ as such ] before Me are thieves and robbers , but the [ true ] sheep did not listen to and obey them .
AMPC	John	10	9	I am the Door ; anyone who enters in through Me will be saved ( will live ) . He will come in and he will go out [ freely ] , and will find pasture .
AMPC	John	10	11	I am the Good Shepherd . The Good Shepherd risks and lays down His [ own ] life for the sheep . ( A )
AMPC	John	10	12	But the hired servant ( he who merely serves for wages ) who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep , when he sees the wolf coming , deserts the flock and runs away . And the wolf chases and snatches them and scatters [ the flock ] .
AMPC	John	10	13	Now the hireling flees because he merely serves for wages and is not himself concerned about the sheep [ cares nothing for them ] .
AMPC	John	10	14	I am the Good Shepherd ; and I know and recognize My own , and My own know and recognize Me—
AMPC	John	10	15	Even as [ truly as ] the Father knows Me and I also know the Father—and I am giving My [ very own ] life and laying it down on behalf of the sheep .
AMPC	John	10	16	And I have other sheep [ beside these ] that are not of this fold . I must bring and [ c ] impel those also ; and they will listen to My voice and heed My call , and so there will be [ they will become ] one flock under one Shepherd . ( B )
AMPC	John	10	17	For this [ reason ] the Father loves Me , because I lay down My [ own ] life—to take it back again .
AMPC	John	10	18	No one takes it away from Me . On the contrary , I lay it down voluntarily . [ I put it from Myself . ] I am authorized and have power to lay it down ( to resign it ) and I am authorized and have power to take it back again . These are the instructions ( orders ) which I have received [ as My charge ] from My Father .
AMPC	John	10	19	Then a fresh division of opinion arose among the Jews because of His saying these things .
AMPC	John	10	20	And many of them said , He has a demon and He is mad ( insane—He raves , He rambles ) . Why do you listen to Him ?
AMPC	John	10	21	Others argued , These are not the thoughts and the language of one possessed . Can a demon-possessed person open blind eyes ?
AMPC	John	10	22	After this the Feast of Dedication [ of the reconsecration of the temple ] was taking place at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
AMPC	John	10	23	And Jesus was walking in Solomon ’ s Porch in the temple area .
AMPC	John	10	24	So the Jews surrounded Him and began asking Him , How long are You going to keep us in doubt and suspense ? If You are really the Christ ( the Messiah ) , tell us so plainly and openly .
AMPC	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , I have told you so , yet you do not believe Me [ you do not trust Me and rely on Me ] . The very works that I do by the power of My Father and in My Father ’ s name bear witness concerning Me [ they are My credentials and evidence in support of Me ] .
AMPC	John	10	26	But you do not believe and trust and rely on Me because you do not belong to My fold [ you are no sheep of Mine ] .
AMPC	John	10	27	The sheep that are My own hear and are listening to My voice ; and I know them , and they follow Me .
AMPC	John	10	28	And I give them eternal life , and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages . [ To all eternity they shall never by any means be destroyed . ] And no one is able to snatch them out of My hand .
AMPC	John	10	29	My Father , Who has given them to Me , is greater and mightier than all [ else ] ; and no one is able to snatch [ them ] out of the Father ’ s hand .
AMPC	John	10	30	I and the Father are One .
AMPC	John	10	31	Again the Jews [ d ] brought up stones to stone Him .
AMPC	John	10	32	Jesus said to them , My Father has enabled Me to do many good deeds . [ I have shown many acts of mercy in your presence . ] For which of these do you mean to stone Me ?
AMPC	John	10	33	The Jews replied , We are not going to stone You for a good act , but for blasphemy , because You , a mere [ e ] Man , make Yourself [ out to be ] God .
AMPC	John	10	34	Jesus answered , Is it not written in your Law , I said , You are gods ? ( C )
AMPC	John	10	35	So men are called gods [ by the Law ] , men to whom God ’ s message came—and the Scripture can not be set aside or cancelled or broken or annulled—
AMPC	John	10	36	[ If that is true ] do you say of the One Whom the Father consecrated and dedicated and set apart for Himself and sent into the world , You are blaspheming , because I said , I am the Son of God ?
AMPC	John	10	37	If I am not doing the works [ performing the deeds ] of My Father , then do not believe Me [ do not adhere to Me and trust Me and rely on Me ] .
AMPC	John	10	38	But if I do them , even though you do not believe Me or have faith in Me , [ at least ] believe the works and have faith in what I do , in order that you may know and understand [ clearly ] that the Father is in Me , and I am in the Father [ One with Him ] .
AMPC	John	10	39	They sought again to arrest Him , but He escaped from their hands .
AMPC	John	10	40	He went back again across the Jordan to the locality where John was when he first baptized , and there He remained .
AMPC	John	10	41	And many came to Him , and they kept saying , John did not perform a [ single ] sign or miracle , but everything John said about this Man was true .
AMPC	John	10	42	And many [ people ] there became believers in Him . [ They adhered to and trusted in and relied on Him . ] Footnotes - John 10:7 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - John 10:10 Alexander Souter , Pocket Lexicon of the Greek New Testament . - John 10:16 G.

AMPC	John	11	11	He said these things , and then added , Our friend Lazarus is at rest and sleeping ; but I am going there that I may awaken him out of his sleep .
AMPC	John	11	2	This Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair . It was her brother Lazarus who was [ now ] sick .
AMPC	John	11	3	So the sisters sent to Him , saying , Lord , he whom You love [ so well ] is sick .
AMPC	John	11	4	When Jesus received the message , He said , This sickness is not to end in death ; but [ on the contrary ] it is to honor God and to promote His glory , that the Son of God may be glorified through ( by ) it .
AMPC	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus . [ They were His dear friends , and He held them in loving esteem . ]
AMPC	John	11	6	Therefore [ even ] when He heard that Lazarus was sick , He still stayed two days longer in the same place where He was .
AMPC	John	11	7	Then after that interval He said to His disciples , Let us go back again to Judea .
AMPC	John	11	8	The disciples said to Him , Rabbi , the Jews only recently were intending and trying to stone You , and are You [ thinking of ] going back there again ?
AMPC	John	11	9	Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? Anyone who walks about in the daytime does not stumble , because he sees [ by ] the light of this world .
AMPC	John	11	10	But if anyone walks about in the night , he does stumble , because there is no light in him [ the light is lacking to him ] .
AMPC	John	11	12	The disciples answered , Lord , if he is sleeping , he will recover .
AMPC	John	11	13	However , Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that He referred to falling into a refreshing and natural sleep .
AMPC	John	11	14	So then Jesus told them plainly , Lazarus is dead ,
AMPC	John	11	15	And for your sake I am glad that I was not there ; it will help you to believe ( to trust and rely on Me ) . However , let us go to him .
AMPC	John	11	16	Then Thomas , who was called the Twin , said to his fellow disciples , Let us go too , that we may die [ be killed ] along with Him .
AMPC	John	11	17	So when Jesus arrived , He found that he [ Lazarus ] had already been in the tomb four days .
AMPC	John	11	18	Bethany was near Jerusalem , only about two miles away ,
AMPC	John	11	19	And a considerable number of the Jews had gone out to see Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother .
AMPC	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet Him , while Mary remained sitting in the house .
AMPC	John	11	21	Martha then said to Jesus , Master , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
AMPC	John	11	22	And even now I know that whatever You ask from God , He will grant it to You .
AMPC	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , Your brother shall rise again .
AMPC	John	11	24	Martha replied , I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
AMPC	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , I am [ Myself ] the Resurrection and the Life . Whoever believes in ( adheres to , trusts in , and relies on ) Me , although he may die , yet he shall live ;
AMPC	John	11	26	And whoever continues to live and believes in ( has faith in , cleaves to , and relies on ) Me shall never [ actually ] die at all . Do you believe this ?
AMPC	John	11	27	She said to Him , Yes , Lord , I have believed [ I do believe ] that You are the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) , the Son of God , [ even He ] Who was to come into the world . [ It is for Your coming that the world has waited . ]
AMPC	John	11	28	After she had said this , she went back and called her sister Mary , privately whispering to her , The Teacher is close at hand and is asking for you .
AMPC	John	11	29	When she heard this , she sprang up quickly and went to Him .
AMPC	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village , but was still at the same spot where Martha had met Him .
AMPC	John	11	31	When the Jews who were sitting with her in the house and consoling her saw how hastily Mary had arisen and gone out , they followed her , supposing that she was going to the tomb to pour out her grief there .
AMPC	John	11	32	When Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw Him , she dropped down at His feet , saying to Him , Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
AMPC	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her sobbing , and the Jews who came with her [ also ] sobbing , He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled . [ He chafed in spirit and sighed and was disturbed . ]
AMPC	John	11	34	And He said , Where have you laid him ? They said to Him , Lord , come and see .
AMPC	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
AMPC	John	11	36	The Jews said , See how [ tenderly ] He loved him !
AMPC	John	11	37	But some of them said , Could not He Who opened a blind man ’ s eyes have prevented this man from dying ?
AMPC	John	11	38	Now Jesus , again sighing repeatedly and deeply disquieted , approached the tomb . It was a cave ( a hole in the rock ) , and a boulder lay against [ the entrance to close ] it .
AMPC	John	11	39	Jesus said , Take away the stone . Martha , the sister of the dead man , exclaimed , But Lord , by this time he [ is decaying and ] throws off an offensive odor , for he has been dead four days !
AMPC	John	11	40	Jesus said to her , Did I not tell you and [ a ] promise you that if you would believe and rely on Me , you would see the glory of God ?
AMPC	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said , Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
AMPC	John	11	42	Yes , I know You always hear and listen to Me , but I have said this on account of and for the benefit of the people standing around , so that they may believe that You did send Me [ that You have made Me Your Messenger ] .
AMPC	John	11	43	When He had said this , He shouted with a loud voice , Lazarus , come out !
AMPC	John	11	44	And out walked the man who had been dead , his hands and feet wrapped in burial cloths ( linen strips ) , and with a [ burial ] napkin bound around his face . Jesus said to them , Free him of the burial wrappings and let him go .
AMPC	John	11	45	Upon seeing what Jesus had done , many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed in Him . [ They trusted in Him and adhered to Him and relied on Him . ]
AMPC	John	11	46	But some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
AMPC	John	11	47	So the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council ( the Sanhedrin ) and said , What are we to do ? For this Man performs many signs ( evidences , miracles ) .
AMPC	John	11	48	If we let Him alone to go on like this , everyone will believe in Him and adhere to Him , and the Romans will come and suppress and destroy and take away our [ holy ] place and our nation [ [ b ] our temple and city and our civil organization ] .
AMPC	John	11	49	But one of them , Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year , declared , You know nothing at all !
AMPC	John	11	50	Nor do you understand or reason out that it is expedient and better for your own welfare that one man should die on behalf of the people than that the whole nation should perish ( be destroyed , ruined ) .
AMPC	John	11	51	Now he did not say this simply of his own accord [ he was not self-moved ] ; but being the high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation , ( A )
AMPC	John	11	52	And not only for the nation but also for the purpose of uniting into one body the children of God who have been scattered far and wide . ( B )
AMPC	John	11	53	So from that day on they took counsel and plotted together how they might put Him to death .
AMPC	John	11	54	For that reason Jesus no longer appeared publicly among the Jews , but left there and retired to the district that borders on the wilderness ( the desert ) , to a village called Ephraim , and there He stayed with the disciples .
AMPC	John	11	55	Now the Jewish Passover was at hand , and many from the country went up to Jerusalem in order that they might purify and consecrate themselves before the Passover .
AMPC	John	11	56	So they kept looking for Jesus and questioned among themselves as they were standing about in the temple [ [ c ] area ] , What do you think ? Will He not come to the Feast at all ?
AMPC	John	11	57	Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he should report it to them , so that they might arrest Him . Footnotes - John 11:40 Charles B.

AMPC	John	12	12	The next day a vast crowd of those who had come to the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem .
AMPC	John	12	2	So they made Him a supper ; and Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those at the table with Him .
AMPC	John	12	3	Mary took a pound of ointment of pure liquid nard [ a rare perfume ] that was very expensive , and she poured it on Jesus ’ feet and wiped them with her hair . And the whole house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
AMPC	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot , the one of His disciples who was about to betray Him , said ,
AMPC	John	12	5	Why was this perfume not sold for
AMPC	John	12	300	denarii [ a year ’ s wages for an ordinary workman ] and that [ money ] given to the poor ( the destitute ) ?
AMPC	John	12	6	Now he did not say this because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief ; and having the bag ( the money box , the purse of the Twelve ) , he took for himself what was put into it [ pilfering the collections ] .
AMPC	John	12	7	But Jesus said , Let her alone . It was [ intended ] that she should keep it for the time of My preparation for burial . [ She has kept it that she might have it for the time of My [ a ] embalming . ]
AMPC	John	12	8	You always have the poor with you , but you do not always have Me .
AMPC	John	12	9	Now a great crowd of the Jews heard that He was at Bethany , and they came there , not only because of Jesus but that they also might see Lazarus , whom He had raised from the dead .
AMPC	John	12	10	So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also ,
AMPC	John	12	11	Because on account of him many of the Jews were going away [ were withdrawing from and leaving the Judeans ] and believing in and adhering to Jesus .
AMPC	John	12	13	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him . And as they went , they kept shouting , Hosanna ! Blessed is He and praise to Him Who comes in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel ! ( A )
AMPC	John	12	14	And Jesus , having found a young donkey , rode upon it , [ just ] as it is written in the Scriptures ,
AMPC	John	12	15	Do not fear , O Daughter of Zion ! Look ! Your King is coming , sitting on a donkey ’ s colt ! ( B )
AMPC	John	12	16	His disciples did not understand and could not comprehend the meaning of these things at first ; but when Jesus was glorified and exalted , they remembered that these things had been written about Him and had been done to Him .
AMPC	John	12	17	The group that had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from among the dead kept telling it [ bearing witness ] to others .
AMPC	John	12	18	It was for this reason that the crowd went out to meet Him , because they had heard that He had performed this sign ( proof , miracle ) .
AMPC	John	12	19	Then the Pharisees said among themselves , You see how futile your efforts are and how you accomplish nothing . See ! The whole world is running after Him !
AMPC	John	12	20	Now among those who went up to worship at the Feast were some Greeks .
AMPC	John	12	21	These came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and they made this request , Sir , we desire to see Jesus .
AMPC	John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip together [ went ] and told Jesus .
AMPC	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted .
AMPC	John	12	24	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains [ just one grain ; it never becomes more but lives ] by itself alone . But if it dies , it produces many others and yields a rich harvest .
AMPC	John	12	25	Anyone who loves his life loses it , but anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal . [ Whoever has no love for , no concern for , no regard for his life here on earth , but despises it , preserves his life forever and ever . ]
AMPC	John	12	26	If anyone serves Me , he must continue to follow Me [ [ b ] to cleave steadfastly to Me , conform wholly to My example in living and , if need be , in dying ] and wherever I am , there will My servant be also . If anyone serves Me , the Father will honor him .
AMPC	John	12	27	Now My soul is troubled and distressed , and what shall I say ? Father , save Me from this hour [ of trial and agony ] ? But it was for this very purpose that I have come to this hour [ that I might undergo it ] .
AMPC	John	12	28	[ Rather , I will say , ] Father , glorify ( honor and extol ) Your [ own ] name ! Then there came a voice out of heaven saying , I have already glorified it , and I will glorify it again .
AMPC	John	12	29	The crowd of bystanders heard the sound and said that it had thundered ; others said , An angel has spoken to Him !
AMPC	John	12	30	Jesus answered , This voice has not come for My sake , but for your sake .
AMPC	John	12	31	Now the judgment ( crisis ) of this world is coming on [ sentence is now being passed on this world ] . Now the ruler ( evil genius , prince ) of this world shall be cast out ( expelled ) .
AMPC	John	12	32	And I , if and when I am lifted up from the earth [ on the cross ] , will draw and attract all men [ Gentiles as well as Jews ] to Myself .
AMPC	John	12	33	He said this to signify in what manner He would die .
AMPC	John	12	34	At this the people answered Him , We have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever ; how then can You say , The Son of Man must be lifted up [ on the cross ] ? Who is this Son of Man ? ( C )
AMPC	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them , You will have the Light only a little while longer . Walk while you have the Light [ keep on living by it ] , so that darkness may not overtake and overcome you . He who walks about in the dark does not know where he goes [ he is drifting ] .
AMPC	John	12	36	While you have the Light , believe in the Light [ have faith in it , hold to it , rely on it ] , that you may become sons of the Light and be filled with Light . Jesus said these things , and then He went away and hid Himself from them [ was lost to their view ] .
AMPC	John	12	37	Even though He had done so many miracles before them ( right before their eyes ) , yet they still did not trust in Him and failed to believe in Him—
AMPC	John	12	38	So that what Isaiah the prophet said was fulfilled : Lord , who has believed our report and our message ? And to whom has the arm ( the power ) of the Lord been shown ( unveiled and revealed ) ? ( D )
AMPC	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe [ they were unable to believe ] . For Isaiah has also said ,
AMPC	John	12	40	He has blinded their eyes and hardened and benumbed their [ callous , degenerated ] hearts [ He has made their minds dull ] , to keep them from seeing with their eyes and understanding with their hearts and minds and repenting and turning to Me to heal them .
AMPC	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw His glory and spoke of Him . ( E )
AMPC	John	12	42	And yet [ in spite of all this ] many even of the leading men ( the authorities and the nobles ) believed and trusted in Him . But because of the Pharisees they did not confess it , for fear that [ if they should acknowledge Him ] they would be expelled from the synagogue ;
AMPC	John	12	43	For they loved the approval and the praise and the glory that come from men [ instead of and ] more than the glory that comes from God . [ They valued their credit with men more than their credit with God . ]
AMPC	John	12	44	But Jesus loudly declared , The one who believes in Me does not [ only ] believe in and trust in and rely on Me , but [ in believing in Me he believes ] in Him Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	12	45	And whoever sees Me sees Him Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	12	46	I have come as a Light into the world , so that whoever believes in Me [ whoever cleaves to and trusts in and relies on Me ] may not continue to live in darkness .
AMPC	John	12	47	If anyone hears My teachings and fails to observe them [ does not keep them , but disregards them ] , it is not I who judges him . For I have not come to judge and to condemn and to pass sentence and to inflict penalty on the world , but to save the world .
AMPC	John	12	48	Anyone who rejects Me and persistently sets Me at naught , refusing to accept My teachings , has his judge [ however ] ; for the [ very ] message that I have spoken will itself judge and convict him at the last day .
AMPC	John	12	49	This is because I have never spoken on My own authority or of My own accord or as self-appointed , but the Father Who sent Me has Himself given Me orders [ concerning ] what to say and what to tell . ( F )
AMPC	John	12	50	And I know that His commandment is ( means ) eternal life . So whatever I speak , I am saying [ exactly ] what My Father has told Me to say and in accordance with His instructions .

AMPC	John	13	13	You call Me the Teacher ( Master ) and the Lord , and you are right in doing so , for that is what I am .
AMPC	John	13	2	So [ it was ] during supper , Satan having already put the thought of betraying Jesus in the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son ,
AMPC	John	13	3	[ That ] Jesus , knowing ( fully aware ) that the Father had put everything into His hands , and that He had come from God and was [ now ] returning to God ,
AMPC	John	13	4	Got up from supper , took off His garments , and taking a [ servant ’ s ] towel , He fastened it around His waist .
AMPC	John	13	5	Then He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples ’ feet and to wipe them with the [ servant ’ s ] towel with which He was girded .
AMPC	John	13	6	When He came to Simon Peter , [ Peter ] said to Him , Lord , are my feet to be washed by You ? [ Is it for You to wash my feet ? ]
AMPC	John	13	7	Jesus said to him , You do not understand now what I am doing , but you will understand later on .
AMPC	John	13	8	Peter said to Him , You shall never wash my feet ! Jesus answered him , Unless I wash you , you have no part with ( [ b ] in ) Me [ you have no share in companionship with Me ] .
AMPC	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to Him , Lord , [ wash ] not only my feet , but my hands and my head too !
AMPC	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , but is clean all over . And you [ My disciples ] are clean , but not all of you .
AMPC	John	13	11	For He knew who was going to betray Him ; that was the reason He said , Not all of you are clean .
AMPC	John	13	12	So when He had finished washing their feet and had put on His garments and had sat down again , He said to them , Do you understand what I have done to you ?
AMPC	John	13	14	If I then , your Lord and Teacher ( Master ) , have washed your feet , you ought [ it is your duty , you are under obligation , you owe it ] to wash one another ’ s feet .

AMPC	John	13	16	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , A servant is not greater than his master , and no one who is sent is superior to the one who sent him .
AMPC	John	13	17	If you know these things , blessed and happy and [ c ] to be envied are you if you practice them [ if you act accordingly and really do them ] .
AMPC	John	13	18	I am not speaking of and I do not mean all of you . I know whom I have chosen ; but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled , He who eats [ d ] My bread with Me has raised up his heel against Me . ( A )
AMPC	John	13	19	I tell you this now before it occurs , so that when it does take place you may be persuaded and believe that I am He [ Who I say I am—the Christ , the Anointed One , the Messiah ] .
AMPC	John	13	20	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , he who receives and welcomes and takes into his heart any messenger of Mine receives Me [ in just that way ] ; and he who receives and welcomes and takes Me into his heart receives Him Who sent Me [ in that same way ] .
AMPC	John	13	21	After Jesus had said these things , He was troubled ( disturbed , agitated ) in spirit and said , I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , one of you will deliver Me up [ one of you will be false to Me and betray Me ] !
AMPC	John	13	22	The disciples kept looking at one another , puzzled as to whom He could mean .
AMPC	John	13	23	One of His disciples , whom Jesus loved [ whom He esteemed and delighted in ] , was reclining [ next to Him ] on Jesus ’ bosom .
AMPC	John	13	24	So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask of whom He was speaking .
AMPC	John	13	25	Then leaning back against Jesus ’ breast , he asked Him , Lord , who is it ?
AMPC	John	13	26	Jesus answered , It is the one to whom I am going to give this morsel ( bit ) of food after I have dipped it . So when He had dipped the morsel of bread [ into the dish ] , He gave it to Judas , Simon Iscariot ’ s son .
AMPC	John	13	27	Then after [ he had taken ] the bit of food , Satan entered into and took possession of [ Judas ] . Jesus said to him , What you are going to do , do [ e ] more swiftly than you seem to intend and [ f ] make quick work of it .
AMPC	John	13	28	But nobody reclining at the table knew why He spoke to him or what He meant by telling him this .
AMPC	John	13	29	Some thought that , since Judas had the money box ( the purse ) , Jesus was telling him , Buy what we need for the Festival , or that he should give something to the poor .
AMPC	John	13	30	So after receiving the bit of bread , he went out immediately . And it was night .
AMPC	John	13	31	When he had left , Jesus said , Now is the Son of Man glorified ! [ Now He has achieved His glory , His honor , His exaltation ! ] And God has been glorified through and in Him .
AMPC	John	13	32	And if God is glorified through and in Him , God will also glorify Him in Himself , and He will glorify Him at once and not delay .
AMPC	John	13	33	[ Dear ] little children , I am to be with you only a little longer . You will look for Me and , as I told the Jews , so I tell you now : you are not able to come where I am going .
AMPC	John	13	34	I give you a new commandment : that you should love one another . Just as I have loved you , so you too should love one another .
AMPC	John	13	35	By this shall all [ men ] know that you are My disciples , if you love one another [ if you keep on showing love among yourselves ] .
AMPC	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to Him , Lord , where are You going ? Jesus answered , You are not able to follow Me now where I am going , but you shall follow Me afterwards .
AMPC	John	13	37	Peter said to Him , Lord , why can not I follow You now ? I will lay down my life for You .
AMPC	John	13	38	Jesus answered , Will you [ really ] lay down your life for Me ? I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , before a rooster crows , you will deny Me [ completely disown Me ] three times .

AMPC	John	14	14	[ Yes ] I will grant [ I Myself will do for you ] whatever you shall ask in My Name [ as [ c ] presenting all that I Am ] .
AMPC	John	14	2	In My Father ’ s house there are many dwelling places ( homes ) . If it were not so , I would have told you ; for I am going away to prepare a place for you .
AMPC	John	14	3	And when ( if ) I go and make ready a place for you , I will come back again and will take you to Myself , that where I am you may be also .
AMPC	John	14	4	And [ to the place ] where I am going , you know the way .
AMPC	John	14	5	Thomas said to Him , Lord , we do not know where You are going , so how can we know the way ?
AMPC	John	14	6	Jesus said to him , I am the Way and the Truth and the Life ; no one comes to the Father except by ( through ) Me .
AMPC	John	14	7	If you had known Me [ had learned to recognize Me ] , you would also have known My Father . From now on , you know Him and have seen Him .
AMPC	John	14	8	Philip said to Him , Lord , show us the Father [ cause us to see the Father—that is all we ask ] ; then we shall be satisfied .
AMPC	John	14	9	Jesus replied , Have I been with all of you for so long a time , and do you not recognize and know Me yet , Philip ? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father . How can you say then , Show us the Father ?
AMPC	John	14	10	Do you not believe that I am in the Father , and that the Father is in Me ? What I am telling you I do not say on My own authority and of My own accord ; but the Father Who lives continually in Me does the ( [ a ] His ) works ( His own miracles , deeds of power ) .
AMPC	John	14	11	Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me ; or else believe Me for the sake of the [ very ] works themselves . [ If you can not trust Me , at least let these works that I do in My Father ’ s name convince you . ]
AMPC	John	14	12	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , if anyone steadfastly believes in Me , he will himself be able to do the things that I do ; and he will do even greater things than these , because I go to the Father .
AMPC	John	14	13	And I will do [ I Myself will grant ] whatever you ask in My Name [ as [ b ] presenting all that I Am ] , so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in ( through ) the Son . ( A )
AMPC	John	14	15	If you [ really ] love Me , you will keep ( obey ) My commands .
AMPC	John	14	16	And I will ask the Father , and He will give you another Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Intercessor , Advocate , Strengthener , and Standby ) , that He may remain with you forever—
AMPC	John	14	17	The Spirit of Truth , Whom the world can not receive ( welcome , take to its heart ) , because it does not see Him or know and recognize Him . But you know and recognize Him , for He lives with you [ constantly ] and will be in you .
AMPC	John	14	18	I will not leave you as orphans [ comfortless , desolate , bereaved , forlorn , helpless ] ; I will come [ back ] to you .
AMPC	John	14	19	Just a little while now , and the world will not see Me any more , but you will see Me ; because I live , you will live also .
AMPC	John	14	20	At that time [ when that day comes ] you will know [ for yourselves ] that I am in My Father , and you [ are ] in Me , and I [ am ] in you .
AMPC	John	14	21	The person who has My commands and keeps them is the one who [ really ] loves Me ; and whoever [ really ] loves Me will be loved by My Father , and I [ too ] will love him and will show ( reveal , manifest ) Myself to him . [ I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him . ]
AMPC	John	14	22	Judas , not Iscariot , asked Him , Lord , how is it that You will reveal Yourself [ make Yourself real ] to us and not to the world ?
AMPC	John	14	23	Jesus answered , If a person [ really ] loves Me , he will keep My word [ obey My teaching ] ; and My Father will love him , and We will come to him and make Our home ( abode , special dwelling place ) with him .
AMPC	John	14	24	Anyone who does not [ really ] love Me does not observe and obey My teaching . And the teaching which you hear and heed is not Mine , but [ comes ] from the Father Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	14	25	I have told you these things while I am still with you .
AMPC	John	14	26	But the Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Intercessor , Advocate , Strengthener , Standby ) , the Holy Spirit , Whom the Father will send in My name [ in My place , to represent Me and act on My behalf ] , He will teach you all things . And He will cause you to recall ( will remind you of , bring to your remembrance ) everything I have told you .
AMPC	John	14	27	Peace I leave with you ; My [ own ] peace I now give and bequeath to you . Not as the world gives do I give to you . Do not let your hearts be troubled , neither let them be afraid . [ Stop allowing yourselves to be agitated and disturbed ; and do not permit yourselves to be fearful and intimidated and cowardly and unsettled . ]
AMPC	John	14	28	You heard Me tell you , I am going away and I am coming [ back ] to you . If you [ really ] loved Me , you would have been glad , because I am going to the Father ; for the Father is greater and mightier than I am .
AMPC	John	14	29	And now I have told you [ this ] before it occurs , so that when it does take place you may believe and have faith in and rely on Me .
AMPC	John	14	30	I will not talk with you much more , for the prince ( evil genius , ruler ) of the world is coming . And he has no claim on Me . [ He has nothing in common with Me ; there is nothing in Me that belongs to him , and he has no power over Me . ]
AMPC	John	14	31	But [ [ d ] Satan is coming and ] I do as the Father has commanded Me , so that the world may know ( be convinced ) that I love the Father and that I do only what the Father has instructed Me to do . [ I act in full agreement with His orders . ] Rise , let us go away from here .

AMPC	John	15	15	I do not call you servants ( slaves ) any longer , for the servant does not know what his master is doing ( working out ) . But I have called you My friends , because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from My Father . [ I have revealed to you everything that I have learned from Him . ]
AMPC	John	15	2	Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [ that stops bearing ] He cuts away ( trims off , takes away ) ; and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit , to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit .
AMPC	John	15	3	You are cleansed and pruned already , because of the word which I have given you [ the teachings I have discussed with you ] .
AMPC	John	15	4	Dwell in Me , and I will dwell in you . [ Live in Me , and I will live in you . ] Just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in ( being vitally united to ) the vine , neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me .
AMPC	John	15	5	I am the Vine ; you are the branches . Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much ( abundant ) fruit . However , apart from Me [ cut off from vital union with Me ] you can do nothing .
AMPC	John	15	6	If a person does not dwell in Me , he is thrown out like a [ broken-off ] branch , and withers ; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire , and they are burned .
AMPC	John	15	7	If you live in Me [ abide vitally united to Me ] and My words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts , ask whatever you will , and it shall be done for you .
AMPC	John	15	8	When you bear ( produce ) much fruit , My Father is honored and glorified , and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of Mine .
AMPC	John	15	9	I have loved you , [ just ] as the Father has loved Me ; abide in My love [ [ a ] continue in His love with Me ] .
AMPC	John	15	10	If you keep My commandments [ if you continue to obey My instructions ] , you will abide in My love and live on in it , just as I have obeyed My Father ’ s commandments and live on in His love .
AMPC	John	15	11	I have told you these things , that My joy and delight may be in you , and that your joy and gladness may be of full measure and complete and overflowing .
AMPC	John	15	12	This is My commandment : that you love one another [ just ] as I have loved you .
AMPC	John	15	13	No one has greater love [ no one has shown stronger affection ] than to lay down ( give up ) his own life for his friends .
AMPC	John	15	14	You are My friends if you keep on doing the things which I command you to do .
AMPC	John	15	16	You have not chosen Me , but I have chosen you and I have appointed you [ I have planted you ] , that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing , and that your fruit may be lasting [ that it may remain , abide ] , so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name [ as [ b ] presenting all that I Am ] , He may give it to you .
AMPC	John	15	17	This is what I command you : that you love one another .
AMPC	John	15	18	If the world hates you , know that it hated Me before it hated you .
AMPC	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , the world would treat you with affection and would love you as its own . But because you are not of the world [ no longer one with it ] , but I have chosen ( selected ) you out of the world , the world hates ( detests ) you .
AMPC	John	15	20	Remember that I told you , A servant is not greater than his master [ is not superior to him ] . If they persecuted Me , they will also persecute you ; if they kept My word and obeyed My teachings , they will also keep and obey yours .
AMPC	John	15	21	But they will do all this to you [ inflict all this suffering on you ] because of [ your bearing ] My name and on My account , for they do not know or understand the One Who sent Me .
AMPC	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin [ would be blameless ] ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
AMPC	John	15	23	Whoever hates Me also hates My Father .
AMPC	John	15	24	If I had not done ( accomplished ) among them the works which no one else ever did , they would not be guilty of sin . But [ the fact is ] now they have both seen [ these works ] and have hated both Me and My Father .
AMPC	John	15	25	But [ this is so ] that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled , They hated Me without a cause . ( A )
AMPC	John	15	26	But when the Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Advocate , Intercessor , Strengthener , Standby ) comes , Whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of Truth Who comes ( proceeds ) from the Father , He [ Himself ] will testify regarding Me .
AMPC	John	15	27	But you also will testify and be My witnesses , because you have been with Me from the beginning . Footnotes - John 15:9 Hermann Cremer , Biblico-Theological Lexicon . - John 15:16 Hermann Cremer , Biblico-Theological Lexicon . Copyright ©

AMPC	John	16	16	In a little while you will no longer see Me , and again after a short while you will see Me .
AMPC	John	16	2	They will put you out of ( expel you from ) the synagogues ; but an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think and claim that he has offered service to God .
AMPC	John	16	3	And they will do this because they have not known the Father or Me .
AMPC	John	16	4	But I have told you these things now , so that when they occur you will remember that I told you of them . I did not say these things to you from the beginning , because I was with you .
AMPC	John	16	5	But now I am going to Him Who sent Me , yet none of you asks Me , Where are You going ?
AMPC	John	16	6	But because I have said these things to you , sorrow has filled your hearts [ taken complete possession of them ] .
AMPC	John	16	7	However , I am telling you nothing but the truth when I say it is profitable ( good , expedient , advantageous ) for you that I go away . Because if I do not go away , the Comforter ( Counselor , Helper , Advocate , Intercessor , Strengthener , Standby ) will not come to you [ into close fellowship with you ] ; but if I go away , I will send Him to you [ to be in close fellowship with you ] .
AMPC	John	16	8	And when He comes , He will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin and about righteousness ( uprightness of heart and right standing with God ) and about judgment :
AMPC	John	16	9	About sin , because they do not believe in Me [ trust in , rely on , and adhere to Me ] ;
AMPC	John	16	10	About righteousness ( uprightness of heart and right standing with God ) , because I go to My Father , and you will see Me no longer ;
AMPC	John	16	11	About judgment , because the ruler ( evil genius , prince ) of this world [ Satan ] is judged and condemned and sentence already is passed upon him .
AMPC	John	16	12	I have still many things to say to you , but you are not able to bear them or to take them upon you or to grasp them now .
AMPC	John	16	13	But when He , the Spirit of Truth ( the Truth-giving Spirit ) comes , He will guide you into all the Truth ( the whole , full Truth ) . For He will not speak His own message [ on His own authority ] ; but He will tell whatever He hears [ from the Father ; He will give the message that has been given to Him ] , and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [ that will happen in the future ] .
AMPC	John	16	14	He will honor and glorify Me , because He will take of ( receive , draw upon ) what is Mine and will reveal ( declare , disclose , transmit ) it to you .
AMPC	John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is Mine . That is what I meant when I said that He [ the Spirit ] will take the things that are Mine and will reveal ( declare , disclose , transmit ) it to you .
AMPC	John	16	17	So some of His disciples questioned among themselves , What does He mean when He tells us , In a little while you will no longer see Me , and again after a short while you will see Me , and , Because I go to My Father ?
AMPC	John	16	18	What does He mean by a little while ? We do not know or understand what He is talking about .
AMPC	John	16	19	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him , so He said to them , Are you wondering and inquiring among yourselves what I meant when I said , In a little while you will no longer see Me , and again after a short while you will see Me ?
AMPC	John	16	20	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that you shall weep and grieve , but the world will rejoice . You will be sorrowful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
AMPC	John	16	21	A woman , when she gives birth to a child , has grief ( anguish , agony ) because her time has come . But when she has delivered the child , she no longer remembers her pain ( trouble , anguish ) because she is so glad that a man ( a child , a human being ) has been born into the world .
AMPC	John	16	22	So for the present you are also in sorrow ( in distress and depressed ) ; but I will see you again and [ then ] your hearts will rejoice , and no one can take from you your joy ( gladness , delight ) .
AMPC	John	16	23	And when that time comes , you will ask nothing of Me [ you will need to ask Me no questions ] . I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [ as [ a ] presenting all that I Am ] . ( A )
AMPC	John	16	24	Up to this time you have not asked a [ single ] thing in My Name [ as [ b ] presenting all that I Am ] ; but now ask and keep on asking and you will receive , so that your joy ( gladness , delight ) may be full and complete .
AMPC	John	16	25	I have told you these things in parables ( veiled language , allegories , dark sayings ) ; the hour is now coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech , but I shall tell you about the Father in plain words and openly ( without reserve ) .
AMPC	John	16	26	At that time you will ask ( pray ) in My Name ; and I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf [ for it will be unnecessary ] .
AMPC	John	16	27	For the Father Himself [ tenderly ] loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from the Father .
AMPC	John	16	28	I came out from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I am leaving the world and going to the Father .
AMPC	John	16	29	His disciples said , Ah , now You are speaking plainly to us and not in parables ( veiled language and figures of speech ) !
AMPC	John	16	30	Now we know that You are acquainted with everything and have no need to be asked questions . Because of this we believe that you [ really ] came from God .
AMPC	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , Do you now believe ? [ Do you believe it at last ? ]
AMPC	John	16	32	But take notice , the hour is coming , and it has arrived , when you will all be dispersed and scattered , every man to his own home , leaving Me alone . Yet I am not alone , because the Father is with Me .
AMPC	John	16	33	I have told you these things , so that in Me you may have [ perfect ] peace and confidence . In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration ; but be of good cheer [ take courage ; be confident , certain , undaunted ] ! For I have overcome the world . [ I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you . ] Footnotes - John 16:23 Hermann Cremer , Biblico-Theological Lexicon . - John 16:24 Hermann Cremer , Biblico-Theological Lexicon .

AMPC	John	17	17	Sanctify them [ purify , consecrate , separate them for Yourself , make them holy ] by the Truth ; Your Word is Truth .
AMPC	John	17	2	[ Just as ] You have granted Him power and authority over all flesh ( all humankind ) , [ now glorify Him ] so that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him .
AMPC	John	17	3	And this is eternal life : [ it means ] to know ( to perceive , recognize , become acquainted with , and understand ) You , the only true and real God , and [ likewise ] to know Him , Jesus [ as the ] Christ ( the Anointed One , the Messiah ) , Whom You have sent .
AMPC	John	17	4	I have glorified You down here on the earth by completing the work that You gave Me to do .
AMPC	John	17	5	And now , Father , glorify Me along with Yourself and restore Me to such majesty and honor in Your presence as I had with You before the world existed .
AMPC	John	17	6	I have manifested Your Name [ I have revealed Your very Self , Your real Self ] to the people whom You have given Me out of the world . They were Yours , and You gave them to Me , and they have obeyed and kept Your word .
AMPC	John	17	7	Now [ at last ] they know and understand that all You have given Me belongs to You [ is really and truly Yours ] .
AMPC	John	17	8	For the [ uttered ] words that You gave Me I have given them ; and they have received and accepted [ them ] and have come to know positively and in reality [ to believe with absolute assurance ] that I came forth from Your presence , and they have believed and are convinced that You did send Me .
AMPC	John	17	9	I am praying for them . I am not praying ( requesting ) for the world , but for those You have given Me , for they belong to You .
AMPC	John	17	10	All [ things that are ] Mine are Yours , and all [ things that are ] Yours belong to Me ; and I am glorified in ( through ) them . [ They have done Me honor ; in them My glory is achieved . ]
AMPC	John	17	11	And [ now ] I am no more in the world , but these are [ still ] in the world , and I am coming to You . Holy Father , keep in Your Name [ [ a ] in the knowledge of Yourself ] those whom You have given Me , that they may be one as We [ are one ] .
AMPC	John	17	12	While I was with them , I kept and preserved them in Your Name [ [ b ] in the knowledge and worship of You ] . Those You have given Me I guarded and protected , and not one of them has perished or is lost except the son of perdition [ Judas Iscariot—the one who is now doomed to destruction , destined to be lost ] , that the Scripture might be fulfilled . ( A )
AMPC	John	17	13	And now I am coming to You ; I say these things while I am still in the world , so that My joy may be made full and complete and perfect in them [ that they may experience My delight fulfilled in them , that My enjoyment may be perfected in their own souls , that they may have My gladness within them , filling their hearts ] .
AMPC	John	17	14	I have given and delivered to them Your word ( message ) and the world has hated them , because they are not of the world [ do not belong to the world ] , just as I am not of the world .
AMPC	John	17	15	I do not ask that You will take them out of the world , but that You will keep and protect them from the evil one .
AMPC	John	17	16	They are not of the world ( worldly , belonging to the world ) , [ just ] as I am not of the world .
AMPC	John	17	18	Just as You sent Me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
AMPC	John	17	19	And so for their sake and on their behalf I sanctify ( dedicate , consecrate ) Myself , that they also may be sanctified ( dedicated , consecrated , made holy ) in the Truth .
AMPC	John	17	20	Neither for these alone do I pray [ it is not for their sake only that I make this request ] , but also for all those who will ever come to believe in ( trust in , cling to , rely on ) Me through their word and teaching ,
AMPC	John	17	21	That they all may be one , [ just ] as You , Father , are in Me and I in You , that they also may be one in Us , so that the world may believe and be convinced that You have sent Me .
AMPC	John	17	22	I have given to them the glory and honor which You have given Me , that they may be one [ even ] as We are one :
AMPC	John	17	23	I in them and You in Me , in order that they may become one and perfectly united , that the world may know and [ definitely ] recognize that You sent Me and that You have loved them [ even ] as You have loved Me .
AMPC	John	17	24	Father , I desire that they also whom You have entrusted to Me [ as Your gift to Me ] may be with Me where I am , so that they may see My glory , which You have given Me [ Your love gift to Me ] ; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world .
AMPC	John	17	25	O just and righteous Father , although the world has not known You and has failed to recognize You and has never acknowledged You , I have known You [ continually ] ; and these men understand and know that You have sent Me .
AMPC	John	17	26	I have made Your Name known to them and revealed Your character and Your very [ c ] Self , and I will continue to make [ You ] known , that the love which You have bestowed upon Me may be in them [ felt in their hearts ] and that I [ Myself ] may be in them .

AMPC	John	18	18	Now the servants and the guards ( the attendants ) had made a fire of coals , for it was cold , and they were standing and warming themselves . And Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
AMPC	John	18	2	And Judas , who was betraying Him and delivering Him up , also knew the place , because Jesus had often retired there with His disciples .
AMPC	John	18	3	So Judas , obtaining and taking charge of the band of soldiers and some guards ( attendants ) of the high priests and Pharisees , came there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
AMPC	John	18	4	Then Jesus , knowing all that was about to befall Him , went out to them and said , Whom are you seeking ? [ Whom do you want ? ]
AMPC	John	18	5	They answered Him , Jesus the Nazarene . Jesus said to them , I am He . Judas , who was betraying Him , was also standing with them .
AMPC	John	18	6	When Jesus said to them , I am He , they went backwards ( drew back , lurched backward ) and fell to the ground .
AMPC	John	18	7	Then again He asked them , Whom are you seeking ? And they said , Jesus the Nazarene .
AMPC	John	18	8	Jesus answered , I told you that I am He . So , if you want Me [ if it is only I for Whom you are looking ] , let these men go their way .
AMPC	John	18	9	Thus what He had said was fulfilled and verified , Of those whom You have given Me , I have not lost even one . ( A )
AMPC	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s servant and cut off his right ear . The servant ’ s name was Malchus .
AMPC	John	18	11	Therefore , Jesus said to Peter , Put the sword [ back ] into the sheath ! The cup which My Father has given Me , shall I not drink it ?
AMPC	John	18	12	So the troops and their captain and the guards ( attendants ) of the Jews seized Jesus and bound Him ,
AMPC	John	18	13	And they brought Him first to Annas , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year .
AMPC	John	18	14	It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was expedient and for their welfare that one man should die for ( instead of , in behalf of ) the people . ( B )
AMPC	John	18	15	Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus . And that disciple was known to the high priest , and so he entered along with Jesus into the court of the palace of the high priest ;
AMPC	John	18	16	But Peter was standing outside at the door . So the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter inside .
AMPC	John	18	17	Then the maid who was in charge at the door said to Peter , You are not also one of the disciples of this [ a ] Man , are you ? He said , I am not !
AMPC	John	18	19	Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching .
AMPC	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , I have spoken openly to the world . I have always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [ area ] , where the Jews [ habitually ] congregate ( assemble ) ; and I have spoken nothing secretly .
AMPC	John	18	21	Why do you ask Me ? Ask those who have heard [ Me ] what I said to them . See ! They know what I said .
AMPC	John	18	22	But when He said this , one of the attendants who stood by struck Jesus , saying , Is that how [ b ] You answer the high priest ?
AMPC	John	18	23	Jesus replied , If I have said anything wrong [ if I have spoken abusively , if there was evil in what I said ] tell what was wrong with it . But if I spoke rightly and properly , why do you strike Me ?
AMPC	John	18	24	Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest .
AMPC	John	18	25	But Simon Peter [ still ] was standing and was warming himself . They said to him , You are not also one of His disciples , are you ? He denied it and said , I am not !
AMPC	John	18	26	One of the high priest ’ s servants , a relative of the man whose ear Peter cut off , said , Did I not see you in the garden with Him ?
AMPC	John	18	27	And again Peter denied it . And immediately a rooster crowed .
AMPC	John	18	28	Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium ( judgment hall , governor ’ s palace ) . And it was early . They themselves did not enter the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled ( become ceremonially unclean ) , but might be fit to eat the Passover [ supper ] .
AMPC	John	18	29	So Pilate went out to them and said , What accusation do you bring against this [ c ] Man ?
AMPC	John	18	30	They retorted , If He were not an evildoer ( criminal ) , we would not have handed Him over to you .
AMPC	John	18	31	Pilate said to them , Take Him yourselves and judge and sentence and punish Him according to your [ own ] law . The Jews answered , It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death .
AMPC	John	18	32	This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to show ( indicate , predict ) by what manner of death He was to die . ( C )
AMPC	John	18	33	So Pilate went back again into the judgment hall and called Jesus and asked Him , Are You the King of the Jews ?
AMPC	John	18	34	Jesus replied , Are you saying this of yourself [ on your own initiative ] , or have others told you about Me ?
AMPC	John	18	35	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Your [ own ] people and nation and their chief priests have delivered You to me . What have You done ?
AMPC	John	18	36	Jesus answered , My kingdom ( kingship , royal power ) belongs not to this world . If My kingdom were of this world , My followers would have been fighting to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews . But as it is , My kingdom is not from here ( this world ) ; [ it has no such origin or source ] .
AMPC	John	18	37	Pilate said to Him , Then You are a King ? Jesus answered , You say it ! [ You speak correctly ! ] For I am a King . [ Certainly I am a King ! ] This is why I was born , and for this I have come into the world , to bear witness to the Truth . Everyone who is of the Truth [ who is a friend of the Truth , who belongs to the Truth ] hears and listens to My voice .
AMPC	John	18	38	Pilate said to Him , What is Truth ? On saying this he went out to the Jews again and told them , I find no fault in Him .
AMPC	John	18	39	But it is your custom that I release one [ prisoner ] for you at the Passover . So shall I release for you the King of the Jews ?
AMPC	John	18	40	Then they all shouted back again , Not Him [ not this Man ] , but Barabbas ! Now Barabbas was a robber .

AMPC	John	19	19	And Pilate also wrote a title ( an inscription on a placard ) and put it on the cross . And the writing was : Jesus the Nazarene , the King of the Jews .
AMPC	John	19	2	And the soldiers , having twisted together a crown of thorns , put it on His head , and threw a purple cloak around Him .
AMPC	John	19	3	And they kept coming to Him and saying , Hail , King of the Jews ! [ Good health to you ! Peace to you ! Long life to you , King of the Jews ! ] And they struck Him with the palms of their hands . ( A )
AMPC	John	19	4	Then Pilate went out again and said to them , See , I bring Him out to you , so that you may know that I find no fault ( crime , cause for accusation ) in Him .
AMPC	John	19	5	So Jesus came out wearing the thorny crown and purple cloak , and Pilate said to them , See , [ here is ] the [ a ] Man !
AMPC	John	19	6	When the chief priests and attendants ( guards ) saw Him , they cried out , Crucify Him ! Crucify Him ! Pilate said to them , Take Him yourselves and crucify Him , for I find no fault ( crime ) in Him .
AMPC	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and according to that law He should die , because He has claimed and made Himself out to be the Son of God .
AMPC	John	19	8	So , when Pilate heard this said , he was more alarmed and awestricken and afraid than before .
AMPC	John	19	9	He went into the judgment hall again and said to Jesus , Where are You from ? [ To what world do You belong ? ] But Jesus did not answer him .
AMPC	John	19	10	So Pilate said to Him , Will You not speak [ even ] to me ? Do You not know that I have power ( authority ) to release You and I have power to crucify You ?
AMPC	John	19	11	Jesus answered , You would not have any power or authority whatsoever against ( over ) Me if it were not given you from above . For this reason the sin and guilt of the one who delivered Me over to you is greater .
AMPC	John	19	12	Upon this , Pilate wanted ( sought , was anxious ) to release Him , but the Jews kept shrieking , If you release this Man , you are no friend of Caesar ! Anybody who makes himself [ out to be ] a king sets himself up against Caesar [ is a rebel against the emperor ] !
AMPC	John	19	13	Hearing this , Pilate brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called the Pavement [ the Mosaic Pavement , the Stone Platform ] —in Hebrew , Gabbatha .
AMPC	John	19	14	Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover , and it was about the sixth hour ( about twelve o ’ clock noon ) . He said to the Jews , See , [ here is ] your King !
AMPC	John	19	15	But they shouted , Away with Him ! Away with Him ! Crucify Him ! Pilate said to them , Crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar !
AMPC	John	19	16	Then he delivered Him over to them to be crucified .
AMPC	John	19	17	And they took Jesus and led [ Him ] away ; so He went out , bearing His own cross , to the spot called The Place of the Skull—in Hebrew it is called Golgotha .
AMPC	John	19	18	There they crucified Him , and with Him two others—one on either side and Jesus between them . ( B )
AMPC	John	19	20	And many of the Jews read this title , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city , and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , [ and ] in Greek .
AMPC	John	19	21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , Do not write , The King of the Jews , but , He said , I am King of the Jews .
AMPC	John	19	22	Pilate replied , What I have written , I have written .
AMPC	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His garments and made four parts , one share for each soldier , and also the tunic ( the long shirtlike undergarment ) . But the tunic was seamless , woven [ in one piece ] from the top throughout .
AMPC	John	19	24	So they said to one another , Let us not tear it , but let us cast lots to decide whose it shall be . This was to fulfill the Scripture , They parted My garments among them , and for My clothing they cast lots . So the soldiers did these things . ( C )
AMPC	John	19	25	But by the cross of Jesus stood His mother , His mother ’ s sister , Mary the [ wife ] of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
AMPC	John	19	26	So Jesus , seeing His mother there , and the disciple whom He loved standing near , said to His mother , [ [ b ] Dear ] woman , See , [ here is ] your son !
AMPC	John	19	27	Then He said to the disciple , See , [ here is ] your mother ! And from that hour , the disciple took her into his own [ keeping , own home ] .
AMPC	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , knowing that all was now finished ( ended ) , said in fulfillment of the Scripture , I thirst . ( D )
AMPC	John	19	29	A vessel ( jar ) full of sour wine ( vinegar ) was placed there , so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on [ a stalk , reed of ] hyssop , and held it to [ His ] mouth .
AMPC	John	19	30	When Jesus had received the sour wine , He said , It is finished ! And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit .
AMPC	John	19	31	Since it was the day of Preparation , in order to prevent the bodies from hanging on the cross on the Sabbath—for that Sabbath was a very solemn and important one—the Jews requested Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away .
AMPC	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first one , and of the other who had been crucified with Him .
AMPC	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and they saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
AMPC	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came ( flowed ) out .
AMPC	John	19	35	And he who saw it ( the eyewitness ) gives this evidence , and his testimony is true ; and he knows that he tells the truth , that you may believe also .
AMPC	John	19	36	For these things took place , that the Scripture might be fulfilled ( verified , carried out ) , Not one of His bones shall be broken ; ( E )
AMPC	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says , They shall look on Him Whom they have pierced . ( F )
AMPC	John	19	38	And after this , Joseph of Arimathea—a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews—asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus . And Pilate granted him permission . So he came and took away His body .
AMPC	John	19	39	And Nicodemus also , who first had come to Jesus by night , came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , [ weighing ] about a hundred pounds .
AMPC	John	19	40	So they took Jesus ’ body and bound it in linen cloths with the spices ( aromatics ) , as is the Jews ’ customary way to prepare for burial .
AMPC	John	19	41	Now there was a garden in the place where He was crucified , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one had ever [ yet ] been laid .
AMPC	John	19	42	So there , because of the Jewish day of Preparation [ and ] since the tomb was near by , they laid Jesus .

AMPC	John	20	20	So saying , He showed them His hands and His side . And when the disciples saw the Lord , they were filled with joy ( delight , exultation , ecstasy , rapture ) .
AMPC	John	20	2	So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple , whom Jesus [ tenderly ] loved , and said to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we do not know where they have laid Him !
AMPC	John	20	3	Upon this , Peter and the other disciple came out and they went toward the tomb .
AMPC	John	20	4	And they came running together , but the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first .
AMPC	John	20	5	And stooping down , he saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not enter .
AMPC	John	20	6	Then Simon Peter came up , following him , and went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there ;
AMPC	John	20	7	But the burial napkin ( kerchief ) which had been around Jesus ’ head , was not lying with the other linen cloths , but was [ still ] [ a ] rolled up ( wrapped round and round ) in a place by itself .
AMPC	John	20	8	Then the other disciple , who had reached the tomb first , went in too ; and he saw and was convinced and believed .
AMPC	John	20	9	For as yet they did not know ( understand ) the statement of Scripture that He must rise again from the dead . ( A )
AMPC	John	20	10	Then the disciples went back again to their homes ( lodging places ) .
AMPC	John	20	11	But Mary remained standing outside the tomb sobbing . As she wept , she stooped down [ and looked ] into the tomb .
AMPC	John	20	12	And she saw two angels in white sitting there , one at the head and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
AMPC	John	20	13	And they said to her , Woman , why are you sobbing ? She told them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have laid Him .
AMPC	John	20	14	On saying this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing [ there ] , but she did not know ( recognize ) that it was Jesus .
AMPC	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , Woman , why are you crying [ so ] ? For Whom are you looking ? Supposing that it was the gardener , she replied , Sir , if you carried Him away from here , tell me where you have put Him and I will take Him away .
AMPC	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , Mary ! Turning around she said to Him in Hebrew , Rabboni ! —which means Teacher or Master .
AMPC	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , Do not cling to Me [ do not hold Me ] , for I have not yet ascended to the Father . But go to My brethren and tell them , I am ascending to My Father and your Father , and to My God and your God .
AMPC	John	20	18	Away came Mary Magdalene , bringing the disciples news ( word ) that she had seen the Lord and that He had said these things to her .
AMPC	John	20	19	Then on that same first day of the week , when it was evening , though the disciples were behind closed doors for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood among them and said , Peace to you !
AMPC	John	20	21	Then Jesus said to them again , Peace to you ! [ Just ] as the Father has sent Me forth , so I am sending you .
AMPC	John	20	22	And having said this , He breathed on them and said to them , Receive the Holy Spirit !
AMPC	John	20	23	[ Now having received the Holy Spirit , and being [ b ] led and directed by Him ] if you forgive the sins of anyone , they are forgiven ; if you retain the sins of anyone , they are retained .
AMPC	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the Twelve , called the Twin , was not with them when Jesus came .
AMPC	John	20	25	So the other disciples kept telling him , We have seen the Lord ! But he said to them , Unless I see in His hands the marks made by the nails and put my finger into the nail prints , and put my hand into His side , I will never believe [ it ] .
AMPC	John	20	26	Eight days later His disciples were again in the house , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , though they were behind closed doors , and stood among them and said , Peace to you !
AMPC	John	20	27	Then He said to Thomas , Reach out your finger here , and see My hands ; and put out your hand and place [ it ] in My side . Do not be faithless and incredulous , but [ stop your unbelief and ] believe !
AMPC	John	20	28	Thomas answered Him , My Lord and my God !
AMPC	John	20	29	Jesus said to him , Because you have seen Me , Thomas , do you now believe ( trust , have faith ) ? Blessed and happy and [ c ] to be envied are those who have never seen Me and yet have believed and adhered to and trusted and relied on Me .
AMPC	John	20	30	There are also many other signs and miracles which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book .
AMPC	John	20	31	But these are written ( recorded ) in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the Son of God , and that through believing and cleaving to and trusting and relying upon Him you may have life through ( in ) His name [ [ d ] through Who He is ] .

AMPC	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas , called the Twin , and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee , also the sons of Zebedee , and two others of His disciples .
AMPC	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , I am going fishing ! They said to him , And we are coming with you ! So they went out and got into the boat , and throughout that night they caught nothing .
AMPC	John	21	4	Morning was already breaking when Jesus came to the beach and stood there . However , the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
AMPC	John	21	5	So Jesus said to them , [ a ] Boys ( children ) , you do not have any meat ( fish ) , do you ? [ Have you caught anything to eat along with your bread ? ] They answered Him , No !
AMPC	John	21	6	And He said to them , Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find [ some ] . So they cast the net , and now they were not able to haul it in for such a big catch ( mass , quantity ) of fish [ was in it ] .
AMPC	John	21	7	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , It is the Lord ! Simon Peter , hearing him say that it was the Lord , put ( girded ) on his upper garment ( his fisherman ’ s coat , his outer tunic ) —for he was stripped [ for work ] —and sprang into the sea .
AMPC	John	21	8	And the other disciples came in the small boat , for they were not far from shore , only some hundred yards away , dragging the net full of fish .
AMPC	John	21	9	When they got out on land ( the beach ) , they saw a fire of coals there and fish lying on it [ cooking ] , and bread .
AMPC	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , Bring some of the fish which you have just caught .
AMPC	John	21	11	So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to land , full of large fish ,
AMPC	John	21	153	of them ; and [ though ] there were so many of them , the net was not torn .
AMPC	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , Come [ and ] have breakfast . But none of the disciples ventured or dared to ask Him , Who are You ? because they [ well ] knew that it was the Lord .
AMPC	John	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and so also [ with ] the fish .
AMPC	John	21	14	This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself ( appeared , was manifest ) to the disciples after He had risen from the dead .
AMPC	John	21	15	When they had eaten , Jesus said to Simon Peter , Simon , son of John , do you love Me more than these [ others do—with reasoning , intentional , spiritual devotion , as one loves the Father ] ? He said to Him , Yes , Lord , You know that I love You [ that I have deep , instinctive , personal affection for You , as for a close friend ] . He said to him , Feed My lambs .
AMPC	John	21	16	Again He said to him the second time , Simon , son of John , do you love Me [ with reasoning , intentional , spiritual devotion , as one loves the Father ] ? He said to Him , Yes , Lord , You know that I love You [ that I have a deep , instinctive , personal affection for You , as for a close friend ] . He said to him , Shepherd ( tend ) My sheep .
AMPC	John	21	17	He said to him the third time , Simon , son of John , do you love Me [ with a deep , instinctive , personal affection for Me , as for a close friend ] ? Peter was grieved ( was saddened and hurt ) that He should ask him the third time , Do you love Me ? And he said to Him , Lord , You know everything ; You know that I love You [ that I have a deep , instinctive , personal affection for You , as for a close friend ] . Jesus said to him , Feed My sheep .
AMPC	John	21	18	I assure you , most solemnly I tell you , when you were young you girded yourself [ put on your own belt or girdle ] and you walked about wherever you pleased to go . But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will put a girdle around you and carry you where you do not wish to go .
AMPC	John	21	19	He said this to indicate by what kind of death Peter would glorify God . And after this , He said to him , Follow Me !
AMPC	John	21	20	But Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved , following—the one who also had leaned back on His breast at the supper and had said , Lord , who is it that is going to betray You ?
AMPC	John	21	22	Jesus said to him , If I want him to stay ( survive , live ) until I come , what is that to you ? [ What concern is it of yours ? ] You follow Me !
AMPC	John	21	23	So word went out among the brethren that this disciple was not going to die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die , but , If I want him to stay ( survive , live ) till I come , what is that to you ?
AMPC	John	21	24	It is this same disciple who is bearing witness to these things and who has recorded ( written ) them ; and we [ well ] know that his testimony is true .
AMPC	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did . If they should be all recorded one by one [ in detail ] , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain ( have room for ) the books that would be written .

AMPC	Romans	1	1	From Paul , a bond servant of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) called to be an apostle , ( a special messenger ) set apart to [ preach ] the Gospel ( good news ) of and from God ,
AMPC	Romans	1	2	Which He promised in advance [ long ago ] through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures—
AMPC	Romans	1	3	[ The Gospel ] regarding His Son , Who as to the flesh ( His human nature ) was descended from David ,
AMPC	Romans	1	4	And [ as to His divine nature ] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly [ a ] designated the Son of God in power [ in a striking , triumphant and miraculous manner ] by His resurrection from the dead , even Jesus Christ our Lord ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Romans	1	5	It is through Him that we have received grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) and [ our ] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith and make disciples for His name ’ s sake among all the nations ,
AMPC	Romans	1	6	And this includes you , called of Jesus Christ and invited [ as you are ] to belong to Him .
AMPC	Romans	1	7	To [ you then ] all God ’ s beloved ones in Rome , called to be saints and designated for a consecrated life : Grace and spiritual blessing and peace be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
AMPC	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because [ the report of ] your faith is made known to all the world and is [ b ] commended everywhere .
AMPC	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , Whom I serve with my [ whole ] spirit [ rendering priestly and spiritual service ] in [ preaching ] the Gospel and [ telling ] the good news of His Son , how incessantly I always mention you when at my prayers .
AMPC	Romans	1	10	I keep pleading that somehow by God ’ s will I may now at last prosper and come to you .
AMPC	Romans	1	11	For I am yearning to see you , that I may impart and share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen and establish you ;
AMPC	Romans	1	12	That is , that we may be mutually strengthened and encouraged and comforted by each other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .
AMPC	Romans	1	13	I want you to know , brethren , that many times I have planned and intended to come to you , though thus far I have been hindered and prevented , in order that I might have some fruit ( some result of my labors ) among you , as I have among the rest of the Gentiles .
AMPC	Romans	1	14	Both to Greeks and to barbarians ( to the cultured and to the uncultured ) , both to the wise and the foolish , I have an obligation to discharge and a duty to perform and a debt to pay .
AMPC	Romans	1	15	So , for my part , I am willing and eagerly ready to preach the Gospel to you also who are in Rome .
AMPC	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the Gospel ( good news ) of Christ , for it is God ’ s power working unto salvation [ for deliverance from eternal death ] to everyone who believes with a personal trust and a confident surrender and firm reliance , to the Jew first and also to the Greek ,
AMPC	Romans	1	17	For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed , both springing from faith and leading to faith [ disclosed through the way of faith that arouses to more faith ] . As it is written , The man who through faith is just and upright shall live and shall live by faith . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	1	18	For God ’ s [ holy ] wrath and indignation are revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who in their wickedness repress and hinder the truth and make it inoperative .
AMPC	Romans	1	19	For that which is known about God is evident to them and made plain in their inner consciousness , because God [ Himself ] has shown it to them .
AMPC	Romans	1	20	For ever since the creation of the world His invisible nature and attributes , that is , His eternal power and divinity , have been made intelligible and clearly discernible in and through the things that have been made ( His handiworks ) . So [ men ] are without excuse [ altogether without any defense or justification ] , ( B )
AMPC	Romans	1	21	Because when they knew and recognized Him as God , they did not honor and glorify Him as God or give Him thanks . But instead they became futile and [ c ] godless in their thinking [ with vain imaginings , foolish reasoning , and stupid speculations ] and their senseless minds were darkened .
AMPC	Romans	1	22	Claiming to be wise , they became fools [ professing to be smart , they made simpletons of themselves ] .
AMPC	Romans	1	23	And by them the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God were exchanged for and represented by images , resembling mortal man and birds and beasts and reptiles .
AMPC	Romans	1	24	Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their [ own ] hearts to sexual impurity , to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves [ abandoning them to the degrading power of sin ] ,
AMPC	Romans	1	25	Because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , Who is blessed forever ! Amen ( so be it ) . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	1	26	For this reason God gave them over and abandoned them to vile affections and degrading passions . For their women exchanged their natural function for an unnatural and abnormal one ,
AMPC	Romans	1	27	And the men also turned from natural relations with women and were set ablaze ( burning out , consumed ) with lust for one another—men committing shameful acts with men and suffering in their own [ d ] bodies and personalities the inevitable consequences and penalty of their wrong-doing and going astray , which was [ their ] fitting retribution .
AMPC	Romans	1	28	And so , since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or approve of Him or consider Him worth the knowing , God gave them over to a base and condemned mind to do things not proper or decent but loathsome ,
AMPC	Romans	1	29	Until they were filled ( permeated and saturated ) with every kind of unrighteousness , iniquity , grasping and covetous greed , and malice . [ They were ] full of envy and jealousy , murder , strife , deceit and treachery , ill will and cruel ways . [ They were ] secret backbiters and gossipers ,
AMPC	Romans	1	30	Slanderers , hateful to and hating God , full of insolence , arrogance , [ and ] boasting ; inventors of new forms of evil , disobedient and undutiful to parents .
AMPC	Romans	1	31	[ They were ] without understanding , conscienceless and faithless , heartless and loveless [ and ] merciless .
AMPC	Romans	1	32	Though they are fully aware of God ’ s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve to die , they not only do them themselves but approve and applaud others who practice them .

AMPC	Romans	2	2	[ But ] we know that the judgment ( adverse verdict , sentence ) of God falls justly and in accordance with truth upon those who practice such things .
AMPC	Romans	2	3	And do you think or imagine , O man , when you judge and condemn those who practice such things and yet do them yourself , that you will escape God ’ s judgment and elude His sentence and adverse verdict ?
AMPC	Romans	2	4	Or are you [ so blind as to ] trifle with and presume upon and despise and underestimate the wealth of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering patience ? Are you unmindful or actually ignorant [ of the fact ] that God ’ s kindness is intended to lead you to repent ( [ a ] to change your mind and inner man to accept God ’ s will ) ?
AMPC	Romans	2	5	But by your callous stubbornness and impenitence of heart you are storing up wrath and indignation for yourself on the day of wrath and indignation , when God ’ s righteous judgment ( just doom ) will be revealed .
AMPC	Romans	2	6	For He will render to every man according to his works [ justly , as his deeds deserve ] : ( A )
AMPC	Romans	2	7	To those who by patient persistence in well-doing [ [ b ] springing from piety ] seek [ unseen but sure ] glory and honor and [ [ c ] the eternal blessedness of ] immortality , He will give eternal life .
AMPC	Romans	2	8	But for those who are self-seeking and self-willed and disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness , there will be indignation and wrath .
AMPC	Romans	2	9	[ And ] there will be tribulation and anguish and calamity and constraint for every soul of man who [ habitually ] does evil , the Jew first and also the Greek ( Gentile ) .
AMPC	Romans	2	10	But glory and honor and [ heart ] peace shall be awarded to everyone who [ habitually ] does good , the Jew first and also the Greek ( Gentile ) .
AMPC	Romans	2	11	For God shows no partiality [ [ d ] undue favor or unfairness ; with Him one man is not different from another ] . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	2	12	All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [ regard to ] the Law , and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law .
AMPC	Romans	2	13	For it is not merely hearing the Law [ read ] that makes one righteous before God , but it is the doers of the Law who will be held guiltless and acquitted and justified .
AMPC	Romans	2	14	When Gentiles who have not the [ divine ] Law do instinctively what the Law requires , they are a law to themselves , since they do not have the Law .
AMPC	Romans	2	15	They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts and are operating there , with which their consciences ( sense of right and wrong ) also bear witness ; and their [ moral ] [ e ] decisions ( their arguments of reason , their condemning or approving [ f ] thoughts ) will accuse or perhaps defend and excuse [ them ]
AMPC	Romans	2	16	On that day when , as my Gospel proclaims , God by Jesus Christ will judge men in regard to [ g ] the things which they conceal ( their hidden thoughts ) . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	2	17	But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law and pride yourselves in God and your relationship to Him ,
AMPC	Romans	2	18	And know and understand His will and discerningly approve the better things and have a sense of what is vital , because you are instructed by the Law ;
AMPC	Romans	2	19	And if you are confident that you [ yourself ] are a guide to the blind , a light to those who are in darkness , and [ that
AMPC	Romans	2	20	You are ] a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of the childish , having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
AMPC	Romans	2	21	Well then , you who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? While you teach against stealing , do you steal ( take what does not really belong to you ) ?
AMPC	Romans	2	22	You who say not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery [ are you unchaste in action or in thought ] ? You who abhor and loathe idols , do you rob temples [ do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to God , thus robbing the sanctuary and [ h ] doing sacrilege ] ?
AMPC	Romans	2	23	You who boast in the Law , do you dishonor God by breaking the Law [ by stealthily infringing upon or carelessly neglecting or openly breaking it ] ?
AMPC	Romans	2	24	For , as it is written , The name of God is maligned and blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you ! [ The words to this effect are from your own Scriptures . ] ( D )
AMPC	Romans	2	25	Circumcision does indeed profit if you keep the Law ; but if you habitually transgress the Law , your circumcision is made uncircumcision .
AMPC	Romans	2	26	So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be credited to him as [ equivalent to ] circumcision ?
AMPC	Romans	2	27	Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the Law will condemn you who , although you have the code in writing and have circumcision , break the Law .
AMPC	Romans	2	28	For he is not a [ real ] Jew who is only one outwardly and publicly , nor is [ true ] circumcision something external and physical .
AMPC	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly , and [ true ] circumcision is of the heart , a spiritual and not a literal [ matter ] . His praise is not from men but from God .

AMPC	Romans	3	3	What if some did not believe and were without faith ? Does their lack of faith and their faithlessness nullify and make ineffective and void the faithfulness of God and His fidelity [ to His Word ] ?
AMPC	Romans	3	2	Much in every way . To begin with , to the Jews were entrusted the oracles ( the brief communications , the intentions , the utterances ) of God . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	3	4	By no means ! Let God be found true though every human being is false and a liar , as it is written , That You may be justified and shown to be upright in what You say , and prevail when You are judged [ by sinful men ] . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness thus establishes and exhibits the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? That God is unjust and wrong to inflict His wrath upon us [ Jews ] ? I speak in a [ purely ] human way .
AMPC	Romans	3	6	By no means ! Otherwise , how could God judge the world ?
AMPC	Romans	3	7	But [ you say ] if through my falsehood God ’ s integrity is magnified and advertised and abounds to His glory , why am I still being judged as a sinner ?
AMPC	Romans	3	8	And why should we not do evil that good may come ? —as some slanderously charge us with teaching . Such [ false teaching ] is justly condemned by them .
AMPC	Romans	3	9	Well then , are we [ Jews ] superior and better off than they ? No , not at all . We have already charged that all men , both Jews and Greeks ( Gentiles ) , are under sin [ held down by and subject to its power and control ] .
AMPC	Romans	3	10	As it is written , None is righteous , just and truthful and upright and conscientious , no , not one . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	3	11	No one understands [ no one intelligently discerns or comprehends ] ; no one seeks out God . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	3	12	All have turned aside ; together they have gone wrong and have become unprofitable and worthless ; no one does right , not even one !
AMPC	Romans	3	13	Their throat is a yawning grave ; they use their tongues to deceive ( to mislead and to deal treacherously ) . The venom of asps is beneath their lips . ( E )
AMPC	Romans	3	14	Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness . ( F )
AMPC	Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood .
AMPC	Romans	3	16	Destruction [ as it dashes them to pieces ] and misery mark their ways .
AMPC	Romans	3	17	And they have no experience of the way of peace [ they know nothing about peace , for a peaceful way they do not even recognize ] . ( G )
AMPC	Romans	3	18	There is no [ reverential ] fear of God before their eyes . ( H )
AMPC	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the Law says , it speaks to those who are under the Law , so that [ the murmurs and excuses of ] every mouth may be hushed and all the world may be held accountable to God .
AMPC	Romans	3	20	For no person will be justified ( made righteous , acquitted , and judged acceptable ) in His sight by observing the works prescribed by the Law . For [ the real function of ] the Law is to make men recognize and be conscious of sin [ [ a ] not mere perception , but an acquaintance with sin which works toward repentance , faith , and holy character ] .
AMPC	Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God has been revealed independently and altogether apart from the Law , although actually it is attested by the Law and the Prophets ,
AMPC	Romans	3	22	Namely , the righteousness of God which comes by believing with personal trust and confident reliance on Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . [ And it is meant ] for all who believe . For there is no distinction ,
AMPC	Romans	3	23	Since all have sinned and are falling short of the honor and glory [ b ] which God bestows and receives .
AMPC	Romans	3	24	[ All ] are justified and made upright and in right standing with God , freely and gratuitously by His grace ( His unmerited favor and mercy ) , through the redemption which is [ provided ] in Christ Jesus ,
AMPC	Romans	3	25	Whom God put forward [ [ c ] before the eyes of all ] as a mercy seat and propitiation by His blood [ the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation , to be received ] through faith . This was to show God ’ s righteousness , because in His divine forbearance He had passed over and ignored former sins without punishment .
AMPC	Romans	3	26	It was to demonstrate and prove at the present time ( [ d ] in the now season ) that He Himself is righteous and that He justifies and accepts as righteous him who has [ true ] faith in Jesus .
AMPC	Romans	3	27	Then what becomes of [ our ] pride and [ our ] boasting ? It is excluded ( banished , ruled out entirely ) . On what principle ? [ On the principle ] of doing good deeds ? No , but on the principle of faith .
AMPC	Romans	3	28	For we hold that a man is justified and made upright by faith independent of and distinctly apart from good deeds ( works of the Law ) . [ The observance of the Law has nothing to do with justification . ]
AMPC	Romans	3	29	Or is God merely [ the God ] of Jews ? Is He not the God of Gentiles also ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
AMPC	Romans	3	30	Since it is one and the same God Who will justify the circumcised by faith [ [ e ] which germinated from Abraham ] and the uncircumcised through their [ newly acquired ] faith . [ For it is the same trusting faith in both cases , a firmly relying faith in Jesus Christ ] .
AMPC	Romans	3	31	Do we then by [ this ] faith make the Law of no effect , overthrow it or make it a dead letter ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , we confirm and establish and uphold the Law .

AMPC	Romans	4	4	Now to a laborer , his wages are not counted as a favor or a gift , but as an obligation ( something owed to him ) .
AMPC	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified ( [ a ] established as just by acquittal from guilt ) by good works [ that he did , then ] he has grounds for boasting . But not before God !
AMPC	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? Abraham believed in ( trusted in ) God , and it was credited to his account as righteousness ( right living and right standing with God ) . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	4	5	But to one who , not working [ by the Law ] , trusts ( believes fully ) in Him Who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited to him as righteousness ( the standing acceptable to God ) .
AMPC	Romans	4	6	Thus David [ b ] congratulates the man and pronounces a blessing on him to whom God credits righteousness apart from the works he does :
AMPC	Romans	4	7	Blessed and happy and [ c ] to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up and completely buried .
AMPC	Romans	4	8	Blessed and happy and [ d ] to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account nor reckon it against him . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing ( happiness ) then meant only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness .
AMPC	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited [ to him ] ? Was it before or after he had been circumcised ? It was not after , but before he was circumcised .
AMPC	Romans	4	11	He received the mark of circumcision as a token or an evidence [ and ] seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised— [ faith ] so that he was to be made the father of all who [ truly ] believe , though without circumcision , and who thus have righteousness ( right standing with God ) imputed to them and credited to their account ,
AMPC	Romans	4	12	As well as [ that he be made ] the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised , but also walk in the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
AMPC	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham or his posterity , that he should inherit the world , did not come through [ observing the commands of ] the Law but through the righteousness of faith . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	4	14	If it is the adherents of the Law who are to be the heirs , then faith is made futile and empty of all meaning and the promise [ of God ] is made void ( is annulled and has no power ) .
AMPC	Romans	4	15	For the Law results in [ divine ] wrath , but where there is no law there is no transgression [ of it either ] .
AMPC	Romans	4	16	Therefore , [ inheriting ] the promise is the outcome of faith and depends [ entirely ] on faith , in order that it might be given as an act of grace ( unmerited favor ) , to make it stable and valid and guaranteed to all his descendants—not only to the devotees and adherents of the Law , but also to those who share the faith of Abraham , who is [ thus ] the father of us all .
AMPC	Romans	4	17	As it is written , I have made you the father of many nations . [ He was appointed our father ] in the sight of God in Whom he believed , Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that [ He has foretold and promised ] as if they [ already ] existed . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	4	18	[ For Abraham , human reason for ] hope being gone , hoped in faith that he should become the father of many nations , as he had been promised , So [ numberless ] shall your descendants be . ( E )
AMPC	Romans	4	19	He did not weaken in faith when he considered the [ utter ] impotence of his own body , which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old , or [ when he considered ] the barrenness of Sarah ’ s [ deadened ] womb . ( F )
AMPC	Romans	4	20	No unbelief or distrust made him waver ( doubtingly question ) concerning the promise of God , but he grew strong and was empowered by faith as he gave praise and glory to God ,
AMPC	Romans	4	21	Fully satisfied and assured that God was able and mighty to keep His word and to do what He had promised .
AMPC	Romans	4	22	That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness ( right standing with God ) .
AMPC	Romans	4	23	But [ the words ] , It was credited to him , were written not for his sake alone ,
AMPC	Romans	4	24	But [ they were written ] for our sakes too . [ Righteousness , standing acceptable to God ] will be granted and credited to us also who believe in ( trust in , adhere to , and rely on ) God , Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ,
AMPC	Romans	4	25	Who was betrayed and put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification ( our [ e ] acquittal ) , [ making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God ] .

AMPC	Romans	5	5	Such hope never disappoints or deludes or shames us , for God ’ s love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit Who has been given to us .
AMPC	Romans	5	2	Through Him also we have [ our ] access ( entrance , introduction ) by faith into this grace ( state of God ’ s favor ) in which we [ firmly and safely ] stand . And let us rejoice and exult in our hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God .
AMPC	Romans	5	3	Moreover [ let us also be full of joy now ! ] let us exult and triumph in our troubles and rejoice in our sufferings , knowing that pressure and affliction and hardship produce patient and unswerving endurance .
AMPC	Romans	5	4	And endurance ( fortitude ) develops maturity of [ c ] character ( approved faith and [ d ] tried integrity ) . And character [ of this sort ] produces [ the habit of ] [ e ] joyful and confident hope of eternal salvation .
AMPC	Romans	5	6	While we were yet in weakness [ powerless to help ourselves ] , at the fitting time Christ died for ( in behalf of ) the ungodly .
AMPC	Romans	5	7	Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to give his life even for an upright man , though perhaps for a noble and lovable and generous benefactor someone might even dare to die .
AMPC	Romans	5	8	But God shows and clearly proves His [ own ] love for us by the fact that while we were still sinners , Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) died for us .
AMPC	Romans	5	9	Therefore , since we are now justified ( [ f ] acquitted , made righteous , and brought into right relationship with God ) by Christ ’ s blood , how much more [ certain is it that ] we shall be saved by Him from the indignation and wrath of God .
AMPC	Romans	5	10	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , it is much more [ certain ] , now that we are reconciled , that we shall be saved ( daily delivered from sin ’ s dominion ) through His [ [ g ] resurrection ] life .
AMPC	Romans	5	11	Not only so , but we also rejoice and exultingly glory in God [ in His love and perfection ] through our Lord Jesus Christ , through Whom we have now received and enjoy [ our ] reconciliation . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	5	12	Therefore , as sin came into the world through one man , and death as the result of sin , so death spread to all men , [ [ h ] no one being able to stop it or to escape its power ] because all men sinned .
AMPC	Romans	5	13	[ To be sure ] sin was in the world before ever the Law was given , but sin is not charged to men ’ s account where there is no law [ to transgress ] .
AMPC	Romans	5	14	Yet death held sway from Adam to Moses [ the Lawgiver ] , even over those who did not themselves transgress [ a positive command ] as Adam did . Adam was a type ( prefigure ) of the One Who was to come [ in reverse , [ i ] the former destructive , the Latter saving ] . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	5	15	But God ’ s free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass [ His grace is out of all proportion to the fall of man ] . For if many died through one man ’ s falling away ( his lapse , his offense ) , much more profusely did God ’ s grace and the free gift [ that comes ] through the undeserved favor of the one Man Jesus Christ abound and overflow to and for [ the benefit of ] many .
AMPC	Romans	5	16	Nor is the free gift at all to be compared to the effect of that one [ man ’ s ] sin . For the sentence [ following the trespass ] of one [ man ] brought condemnation , whereas the free gift [ following ] many transgressions brings justification ( [ j ] an act of righteousness ) .
AMPC	Romans	5	17	For if because of one man ’ s trespass ( lapse , offense ) death reigned through that one , much more surely will those who receive [ God ’ s ] overflowing grace ( unmerited favor ) and the free gift of righteousness [ putting them into right standing with Himself ] reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Romans	5	18	Well then , as one man ’ s trespass [ one man ’ s false step and falling away led ] to condemnation for all men , so one Man ’ s act of righteousness [ leads ] to acquittal and right standing with God and life for all men .
AMPC	Romans	5	19	For just as by one man ’ s disobedience ( failing to hear , [ k ] heedlessness , and carelessness ) the many were constituted sinners , so by one Man ’ s obedience the many will be constituted righteous ( made acceptable to God , brought into right standing with Him ) .
AMPC	Romans	5	20	But then Law came in , [ only ] to expand and increase the trespass [ making it more apparent and exciting opposition ] . But where sin increased and abounded , grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) has surpassed it and increased the more and superabounded ,
AMPC	Romans	5	21	So that , [ just ] as sin has reigned in death , [ so ] grace ( His unearned and undeserved favor ) might reign also through righteousness ( right standing with God ) which issues in eternal life through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) our Lord .

AMPC	Romans	6	6	We know that our old ( unrenewed ) self was nailed to the cross with Him in order that [ our ] body [ which is the instrument ] of sin might be made ineffective and inactive for evil , that we might no longer be the slaves of sin .
AMPC	Romans	6	2	Certainly not ! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer ?
AMPC	Romans	6	3	Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death ?
AMPC	Romans	6	4	We were buried therefore with Him by the baptism into death , so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious [ power ] of the Father , so we too might [ habitually ] live and behave in newness of life .
AMPC	Romans	6	5	For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His , we shall also be [ one with Him in sharing ] His resurrection [ by a new life lived for God ] .
AMPC	Romans	6	7	For when a man dies , he is freed ( loosed , delivered ) from [ the power of ] sin [ among men ] .
AMPC	Romans	6	8	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with Him ,
AMPC	Romans	6	9	Because we know that Christ ( the Anointed One ) , being once raised from the dead , will never die again ; death no longer has power over Him .
AMPC	Romans	6	10	For by the death He died , He died to sin [ ending His relation to it ] once for all ; and the life that He lives , He is living to God [ in unbroken fellowship with Him ] .
AMPC	Romans	6	11	Even so consider yourselves also dead to sin and your relation to it broken , but alive to God [ living in unbroken fellowship with Him ] in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore rule as king in your mortal ( short-lived , perishable ) bodies , to make you yield to its cravings and be subject to its lusts and evil passions .
AMPC	Romans	6	13	Do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members [ and [ a ] faculties ] to sin as instruments ( tools ) of wickedness . But offer and yield yourselves to God as though you have been raised from the dead to [ perpetual ] life , and your bodily members [ and [ b ] faculties ] to God , presenting them as implements of righteousness .
AMPC	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not [ any longer ] exert dominion over you , since now you are not under Law [ as slaves ] , but under grace [ as subjects of God ’ s favor and mercy ] .
AMPC	Romans	6	15	What then [ are we to conclude ] ? Shall we sin because we live not under Law but under God ’ s favor and mercy ? Certainly not !
AMPC	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that if you continually surrender yourselves to anyone to do his will , you are the slaves of him whom you obey , whether that be to sin , which leads to death , or to obedience which leads to righteousness ( right doing and right standing with God ) ?
AMPC	Romans	6	17	But thank God , though you were once slaves of sin , you have become obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed .
AMPC	Romans	6	18	And having been set free from sin , you have become the servants of righteousness ( of conformity to the divine will in thought , purpose , and action ) .
AMPC	Romans	6	19	I am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations . For as you yielded your bodily members [ and [ c ] faculties ] as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness , so now yield your bodily members [ and [ d ] faculties ] once for all as servants to righteousness ( right being and doing ) [ which leads ] to sanctification .
AMPC	Romans	6	20	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness .
AMPC	Romans	6	21	But then what benefit ( return ) did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed ? [ None ] for the end of those things is death .
AMPC	Romans	6	22	But now since you have been set free from sin and have become the slaves of God , you have your present reward in holiness and its end is eternal life .
AMPC	Romans	6	23	For the wages which sin pays is death , but the [ bountiful ] free gift of God is eternal life through ( in union with ) Jesus Christ our Lord .

AMPC	Romans	7	7	What then do we conclude ? Is the Law identical with sin ? Certainly not ! Nevertheless , if it had not been for the Law , I should not have recognized sin or have known its meaning . [ For instance ] I would not have known about covetousness [ would have had no consciousness of sin or sense of guilt ] if the Law had not [ repeatedly ] said , You shall not covet and have an evil desire [ for one thing and another ] . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	7	2	For [ instance ] a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives ; but if her husband dies , she is loosed and discharged from the law concerning her husband .
AMPC	Romans	7	3	Accordingly , she will be held an adulteress if she unites herself to another man while her husband lives . But if her husband dies , the marriage law no longer is binding on her [ she is free from that law ] ; and if she unites herself to another man , she is not an adulteress .
AMPC	Romans	7	4	Likewise , my brethren , you have undergone death as to the Law through the [ crucified ] body of Christ , so that now you may belong to Another , to Him Who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God .
AMPC	Romans	7	5	When we were living in the flesh ( mere physical lives ) , the sinful passions that were awakened and aroused up by [ what ] the Law [ makes sin ] were constantly operating in our natural powers ( in our bodily organs , [ a ] in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh ) , so that we bore fruit for death .
AMPC	Romans	7	6	But now we are discharged from the Law and have terminated all intercourse with it , having died to what once restrained and held us captive . So now we serve not under [ obedience to ] the old code of written regulations , but [ under obedience to the promptings ] of the Spirit in newness [ of life ] .
AMPC	Romans	7	8	But sin , finding opportunity in the commandment [ to express itself ] , got a hold on me and aroused and stimulated all kinds of forbidden desires ( lust , covetousness ) . For without the Law sin is dead [ the sense of it is inactive and a lifeless thing ] .
AMPC	Romans	7	9	Once I was alive , but quite apart from and unconscious of the Law . But when the commandment came , sin lived again and I died ( was sentenced by the Law to death ) . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	7	10	And the very legal ordinance which was designed and intended to bring life actually proved [ to mean to me ] death . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing the opportunity and getting a hold on me [ by taking its incentive ] from the commandment , beguiled and entrapped and cheated me , and using it [ as a weapon ] , killed me .
AMPC	Romans	7	12	The Law therefore is holy , and [ each ] commandment is holy and just and good .
AMPC	Romans	7	13	Did that which is good then prove fatal [ bringing death ] to me ? Certainly not ! It was sin , working death in me by using this good thing [ as a weapon ] , in order that through the commandment sin might be shown up clearly to be sin , that the extreme malignity and immeasurable sinfulness of sin might plainly appear .
AMPC	Romans	7	14	We know that the Law is spiritual ; but I am a creature of the flesh [ carnal , unspiritual ] , having been sold into slavery under [ the control of ] sin .
AMPC	Romans	7	15	For I do not understand my own actions [ I am baffled , bewildered ] . I do not practice or accomplish what I wish , but I do the very thing that I loathe [ [ b ] which my moral instinct condemns ] .
AMPC	Romans	7	16	Now if I do [ habitually ] what is contrary to my desire , [ that means that ] I acknowledge and agree that the Law is good ( morally excellent ) and that I take sides with it .
AMPC	Romans	7	17	However , it is no longer I who do the deed , but the sin [ principle ] which is at home in me and has possession of me .
AMPC	Romans	7	18	For I know that nothing good dwells within me , that is , in my flesh . I can will what is right , but I can not perform it . [ I have the intention and urge to do what is right , but no power to carry it out . ]
AMPC	Romans	7	19	For I fail to practice the good deeds I desire to do , but the evil deeds that I do not desire to do are what I am [ ever ] doing .
AMPC	Romans	7	20	Now if I do what I do not desire to do , it is no longer I doing it [ it is not myself that acts ] , but the sin [ principle ] which dwells within me [ [ c ] fixed and operating in my soul ] .
AMPC	Romans	7	21	So I find it to be a law ( rule of action of my being ) that when I want to do what is right and good , evil is ever present with me and I am subject to its insistent demands .
AMPC	Romans	7	22	For I endorse and delight in the Law of God in my inmost self [ with my new nature ] . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	7	23	But I discern in my bodily members [ [ d ] in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh ] a different law ( rule of action ) at war against the law of my mind ( my reason ) and making me a prisoner to the law of sin that dwells in my bodily organs [ [ e ] in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh ] .
AMPC	Romans	7	24	O unhappy and pitiable and wretched man that I am ! Who will release and deliver me from [ the shackles of ] this body of death ?
AMPC	Romans	7	25	O thank God ! [ He will ! ] through Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) our Lord ! So then indeed I , of myself with the mind and heart , serve the Law of God , but with the flesh the law of sin .

AMPC	Romans	8	8	So then those who are living the life of the flesh [ catering to the appetites and impulses of their carnal nature ] can not please or satisfy God , or be acceptable to Him .
AMPC	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life [ which is ] in Christ Jesus [ the law of our new being ] has freed me from the law of sin and of death .
AMPC	Romans	8	3	For God has done what the Law could not do , [ its power ] being weakened by the flesh [ [ a ] the entire nature of man without the Holy Spirit ] . Sending His own Son in the guise of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin , [ God ] condemned sin in the flesh [ [ b ] subdued , overcame , [ c ] deprived it of its power over all who accept that sacrifice ] , ( B )
AMPC	Romans	8	4	So that the righteous and just requirement of the Law might be fully met in us who live and move not in the ways of the flesh but in the ways of the Spirit [ our lives governed not by the standards and according to the dictates of the flesh , but controlled by the Holy Spirit ] .
AMPC	Romans	8	5	For those who are according to the flesh and are controlled by its unholy desires set their minds on and [ d ] pursue those things which gratify the flesh , but those who are according to the Spirit and are controlled by the desires of the Spirit set their minds on and [ e ] seek those things which gratify the [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMPC	Romans	8	6	Now the mind of the flesh [ which is sense and reason without the Holy Spirit ] is death [ death that [ f ] comprises all the miseries arising from sin , both here and hereafter ] . But the mind of the [ Holy ] Spirit is life and [ soul ] peace [ both now and forever ] .
AMPC	Romans	8	7	[ That is ] because the mind of the flesh [ with its carnal thoughts and purposes ] is hostile to God , for it does not submit itself to God ’ s Law ; indeed it can not .
AMPC	Romans	8	9	But you are not living the life of the flesh , you are living the life of the Spirit , if the [ Holy ] Spirit of God [ really ] dwells within you [ directs and controls you ] . But if anyone does not possess the [ Holy ] Spirit of Christ , he is none of His [ he does not belong to Christ , is not truly a child of God ] . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	8	10	But if Christ lives in you , [ then although ] your [ natural ] body is dead by reason of sin and guilt , the spirit is alive because of [ the ] righteousness [ that He imputes to you ] .
AMPC	Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you , [ then ] He Who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also restore to life your mortal ( short-lived , perishable ) bodies through His Spirit Who dwells in you .
AMPC	Romans	8	12	So then , brethren , we are debtors , but not to the flesh [ we are not obligated to our carnal nature ] , to live [ a life ruled by the standards set up by the dictates ] of the flesh .
AMPC	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to [ the dictates of ] the flesh , you will surely die . But if through the power of the [ Holy ] Spirit you are [ habitually ] putting to death ( making extinct , deadening ) the [ evil ] deeds prompted by the body , you shall [ really and genuinely ] live forever .
AMPC	Romans	8	14	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
AMPC	Romans	8	15	For [ the Spirit which ] you have now received [ is ] not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in bondage to fear , but you have received the Spirit of adoption [ the Spirit producing sonship ] in [ the bliss of ] which we cry , Abba ( Father ) ! Father !
AMPC	Romans	8	16	The Spirit Himself [ thus ] testifies together with our own spirit , [ assuring us ] that we are children of God .
AMPC	Romans	8	17	And if we are [ His ] children , then we are [ His ] heirs also : heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [ sharing His inheritance with Him ] ; only we must share His suffering if we are to share His glory .
AMPC	Romans	8	18	[ But what of that ? ] For I consider that the sufferings of this present time ( this present life ) are not worth being compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us and [ g ] for us and [ h ] conferred on us !
AMPC	Romans	8	19	For [ even the whole ] creation ( all nature ) waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God ’ s sons to be made known [ waits for the revealing , the disclosing of their sonship ] .
AMPC	Romans	8	20	For the creation ( nature ) was subjected to [ i ] frailty ( to futility , condemned to frustration ) , not because of some intentional fault on its part , but by the will of Him Who so subjected it— [ yet ] with the hope ( D )
AMPC	Romans	8	21	That nature ( creation ) itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and corruption [ and gain an entrance ] into the glorious freedom of God ’ s children .
AMPC	Romans	8	22	We know that the whole creation [ of irrational creatures ] has been moaning together in the pains of labor until now . ( E )
AMPC	Romans	8	23	And not only the creation , but we ourselves too , who have and enjoy the firstfruits of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ a foretaste of the blissful things to come ] groan inwardly as we wait for the redemption of our bodies [ from sensuality and the grave , which will reveal ] our adoption ( our manifestation as God ’ s sons ) .
AMPC	Romans	8	24	For in [ this ] hope we were saved . But hope [ the object of ] which is seen is not hope . For how can one hope for what he already sees ?
AMPC	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what is still unseen by us , we wait for it with patience and composure .
AMPC	Romans	8	26	So too the [ Holy ] Spirit comes to our aid and bears us up in our weakness ; for we do not know what prayer to offer nor how to offer it worthily as we ought , but the Spirit Himself goes to meet our supplication and pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings and groanings too deep for utterance .
AMPC	Romans	8	27	And He Who searches the hearts of men knows what is in the mind of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ what His intent is ] , because the Spirit intercedes and pleads [ before God ] in behalf of the saints according to and in harmony with God ’ s will . ( F )
AMPC	Romans	8	28	We are assured and know that [ [ j ] God being a partner in their labor ] all things work together and are [ fitting into a plan ] for good to and for those who love God and are called according to [ His ] design and purpose .
AMPC	Romans	8	29	For those whom He foreknew [ of whom He was [ k ] aware and [ l ] loved beforehand ] , He also destined from the beginning [ foreordaining them ] to be molded into the image of His Son [ and share inwardly His likeness ] , that He might become the firstborn among many brethren .
AMPC	Romans	8	30	And those whom He thus foreordained , He also called ; and those whom He called , He also justified ( acquitted , made righteous , putting them into right standing with Himself ) . And those whom He justified , He also glorified [ raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being ] .
AMPC	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say to [ all ] this ? If God is for us , who [ can be ] against us ? [ Who can be our foe , if God is on our side ? ] ( G )
AMPC	Romans	8	32	He who did not withhold or spare [ even ] His own Son but gave Him up for us all , will He not also with Him freely and graciously give us all [ other ] things ?
AMPC	Romans	8	33	Who shall bring any charge against God ’ s elect [ when it is ] God Who justifies [ that is , Who puts us in right relation to Himself ? Who shall come forward and accuse or impeach those whom God has chosen ? Will God , Who acquits us ? ]
AMPC	Romans	8	34	Who is there to condemn [ us ] ? Will Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , Who died , or rather Who was raised from the dead , Who is at the right hand of God actually pleading as He intercedes for us ?
AMPC	Romans	8	35	Who shall ever separate us from Christ ’ s love ? Shall suffering and affliction and tribulation ? Or calamity and distress ? Or persecution or hunger or destitution or peril or sword ?
AMPC	Romans	8	36	Even as it is written , For Thy sake we are put to death all the day long ; we are regarded and counted as sheep for the slaughter . ( H )
AMPC	Romans	8	37	Yet amid all these things we are more than conquerors [ m ] and gain a surpassing victory through Him Who loved us .
AMPC	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded beyond doubt ( am sure ) that neither death nor life , nor angels nor principalities , nor things [ n ] impending and threatening nor things to come , nor powers ,
AMPC	Romans	8	39	Nor height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .

AMPC	Romans	9	9	For this is what the promise said , About this time [ next year ] will I return and Sarah shall have a son . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	9	2	That I have bitter grief and incessant anguish in my heart .
AMPC	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off and banished from Christ for the sake of my brethren and instead of them , my natural kinsmen and my fellow countrymen . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	9	4	For they are Israelites , and to them belong God ’ s adoption [ as a nation ] and the glorious Presence ( Shekinah ) . With them were the special covenants made , to them was the Law given . To them [ the temple ] worship was revealed and [ God ’ s own ] promises announced . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	9	5	To them belong the patriarchs , and as far as His natural descent was concerned , from them is the Christ , Who is exalted and supreme over all , God , blessed forever ! Amen ( so let it be ) .
AMPC	Romans	9	6	However , it is not as though God ’ s Word had failed [ coming to nothing ] . For it is not everybody who is a descendant of Jacob ( Israel ) who belongs to [ the true ] Israel .
AMPC	Romans	9	7	And they are not all the children of Abraham because they are by blood his descendants . No , [ the promise was ] Your descendants will be called and counted through the line of Isaac [ though Abraham had an older son ] . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	9	8	That is to say , it is not the children of the body [ of Abraham ] who are made God ’ s children , but it is the offspring to whom the promise applies that shall be counted [ as Abraham ’ s true ] descendants .
AMPC	Romans	9	10	And not only that , but this too : Rebecca conceived [ two sons under exactly the same circumstances ] by our forefather Isaac ,
AMPC	Romans	9	11	And the children were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil . Even so , in order further to carry out God ’ s purpose of selection ( election , choice ) , which depends not on works or what men can do , but on Him Who calls [ them ] ,
AMPC	Romans	9	12	It was said to her that the elder [ son ] should serve the younger [ son ] . ( E )
AMPC	Romans	9	13	As it is written , Jacob have I loved , but Esau have I hated ( held in [ a ] relative disregard in comparison with My feeling for Jacob ) . ( F )
AMPC	Romans	9	14	What shall we conclude then ? Is there injustice upon God ’ s part ? Certainly not !
AMPC	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion ( pity ) on whom I will have compassion . ( G )
AMPC	Romans	9	16	So then [ God ’ s gift ] is not a question of human will and human effort , but of God ’ s mercy . [ It depends not on one ’ s own willingness nor on his strenuous exertion as in running a race , but on God ’ s having mercy on him . ]
AMPC	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , I have raised you up for this very purpose of displaying My power in [ dealing with ] you , so that My name may be proclaimed the whole world over .
AMPC	Romans	9	18	So then He has mercy on whomever He wills ( chooses ) and He hardens ( makes stubborn and unyielding the heart of ) whomever He wills .
AMPC	Romans	9	19	You will say to me , Why then does He still find fault and blame us [ for sinning ] ? For who can resist and withstand His will ?
AMPC	Romans	9	20	But who are you , a mere man , to criticize and contradict and answer back to God ? Will what is formed say to him that formed it , Why have you made me thus ? ( H )
AMPC	Romans	9	21	Has the potter no right over the clay , to make out of the same mass ( lump ) one vessel for beauty and distinction and honorable use , and another for menial or ignoble and dishonorable use ?
AMPC	Romans	9	22	What if God , although fully intending to show [ the awfulness of ] His wrath and to make known His power and authority , has tolerated with much patience the vessels ( objects ) of [ His ] anger which are ripe for destruction ? ( I )
AMPC	Romans	9	23	And [ what if ] He thus purposes to make known and show the wealth of His glory in [ dealing with ] the vessels ( objects ) of His mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory ,
AMPC	Romans	9	24	Even including ourselves whom He has called , not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles ( heathen ) ?
AMPC	Romans	9	25	Just as He says in Hosea , Those who were not My people I will call My people , and her who was not beloved [ I will call ] My beloved . ( J )
AMPC	Romans	9	26	And it shall be that in the very place where it was said to them , You are not My people , they shall be called sons of the living God . ( K )
AMPC	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah calls out ( solemnly cries aloud ) over Israel : Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea , only the remnant ( a small part of them ) will be saved [ [ b ] from perdition , condemnation , judgment ] !
AMPC	Romans	9	28	For the Lord will execute His sentence upon the earth [ He will conclude and close His account with men completely and without delay ] , rigorously cutting it short in His justice . ( L )
AMPC	Romans	9	29	It is as Isaiah predicted , If the Lord of hosts had not left us a seed [ from which to propagate descendants ] , we [ Israel ] would have fared like Sodom and have been made like Gomorrah . ( M )
AMPC	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then ? That Gentiles who did not follow after righteousness [ who did not seek salvation by right relationship to God ] have attained it by faith [ a righteousness imputed by God , based on and produced by faith ] ,
AMPC	Romans	9	31	Whereas Israel , though ever in pursuit of a law [ for the securing ] of righteousness ( right standing with God ) , actually did not succeed in fulfilling the Law . ( N )
AMPC	Romans	9	32	For what reason ? Because [ they pursued it ] not through faith , relying [ instead ] on the merit of their works [ they did not depend on faith but on what they could do ] . They have stumbled over the Stumbling Stone . ( O )
AMPC	Romans	9	33	As it is written , Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone that will make men stumble , a Rock that will make them fall ; but he who believes in Him [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] shall not be put to shame nor be disappointed in his expectations .

AMPC	Romans	10	10	For with the heart a person believes ( adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Christ ) and so is justified ( declared righteous , acceptable to God ) , and with the mouth he confesses ( declares openly and speaks out freely his faith ) and confirms [ his ] salvation .
AMPC	Romans	10	2	I bear them witness that they have a [ certain ] zeal and enthusiasm for God , but it is not enlightened and according to [ correct and vital ] knowledge .
AMPC	Romans	10	3	For being ignorant of the righteousness that God ascribes [ which makes one acceptable to Him in word , thought , and deed ] and seeking to establish a righteousness ( a means of salvation ) of their own , they did not obey or submit themselves to God ’ s righteousness .
AMPC	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the Law [ the limit at which it ceases to be , for the Law leads up to Him Who is the fulfillment of its types , and in Him the purpose which it was designed to accomplish is fulfilled . That is , the purpose of the Law is fulfilled in Him ] as the means of righteousness ( right relationship to God ) for everyone who trusts in and adheres to and relies on Him .
AMPC	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes that the man who [ can ] practice the righteousness ( perfect conformity to God ’ s will ) which is based on the Law [ with all its intricate demands ] shall live by it . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness based on faith [ imputed by God and bringing right relationship with Him ] says , Do not say in your heart , Who will ascend into Heaven ? that is , to bring Christ down ;
AMPC	Romans	10	7	Or who will descend into the abyss ? that is , to bring Christ up from the dead [ as if we could be saved by our own efforts ] . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? The Word ( God ’ s message in Christ ) is near you , on your lips and in your heart ; that is , the Word ( the message , the basis and object ) of faith which we preach , ( C )
AMPC	Romans	10	9	Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe ( adhere to , trust in , and rely on the truth ) that God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved .
AMPC	Romans	10	11	The Scripture says , No man who believes in Him [ who adheres to , relies on , and trusts in Him ] will [ ever ] be put to shame or be disappointed . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	10	12	[ No one ] for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek . The same Lord is Lord over all [ of us ] and He generously bestows His riches upon all who call upon Him [ in faith ] .
AMPC	Romans	10	13	For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord [ invoking Him as Lord ] will be saved . ( E )
AMPC	Romans	10	14	But how are people to call upon Him Whom they have not believed [ in Whom they have no faith , on Whom they have no reliance ] ? And how are they to believe in Him [ adhere to , trust in , and rely upon Him ] of Whom they have never heard ? And how are they to hear without a preacher ?
AMPC	Romans	10	15	And how can men [ be expected to ] preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings ! [ How welcome is the coming of those who preach the good news of His good things ! ] ( F )
AMPC	Romans	10	16	But they have not all heeded the Gospel ; for Isaiah says , Lord , who has believed ( had faith in ) what he has heard from us ? ( G )
AMPC	Romans	10	17	So faith comes by hearing [ what is told ] , and what is heard comes by the preaching [ of the message that came from the lips ] of Christ ( the Messiah Himself ) .
AMPC	Romans	10	18	But I ask , Have they not heard ? Indeed they have ; [ for the Scripture says ] Their voice [ that of nature bearing God ’ s message ] has gone out to all the earth , and their words to the far bounds of the world . ( H )
AMPC	Romans	10	19	Again I ask , Did Israel not understand ? [ Did the Jews have no warning that the Gospel was to go forth to the Gentiles , to all the earth ? ] First , there is Moses who says , I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation ; with a foolish nation I will make you angry . ( I )
AMPC	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah is so bold as to say , I have been found by those who did not seek Me ; I have shown ( revealed ) Myself to those who did not [ consciously ] ask for Me . ( J )
AMPC	Romans	10	21	But of Israel he says , All day long I have stretched out My hands to a people unyielding and disobedient and self-willed [ to a faultfinding , contrary , and contradicting people ] . ( K ) Copyright ©

AMPC	Romans	11	11	So I ask , Have they stumbled so as to fall [ to their utter spiritual ruin , irretrievably ] ? By no means ! But through their false step and transgression salvation [ has come ] to the Gentiles , so as to arouse Israel [ to see and feel what they forfeited ] and so to make them jealous .
AMPC	Romans	11	2	No , God has not rejected and disowned His people [ whose destiny ] He had marked out and appointed and foreknown from the beginning . Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ? ( B )
AMPC	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have killed Your prophets ; they have demolished Your altars , and I alone am left , and they seek my life .
AMPC	Romans	11	4	But what is God ’ s reply to him ? I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal ! ( C )
AMPC	Romans	11	5	So too at the present time there is a remnant ( a small believing minority ) , selected ( chosen ) by grace ( by God ’ s unmerited favor and graciousness ) .
AMPC	Romans	11	6	But if it is by grace ( His unmerited favor and graciousness ) , it is no longer conditioned on works or anything men have done . Otherwise , grace would no longer be grace [ it would be meaningless ] .
AMPC	Romans	11	7	What then [ shall we conclude ] ? Israel failed to obtain what it sought [ God ’ s favor by obedience to the Law ] . Only the elect ( those chosen few ) obtained it , while the rest of them became callously indifferent ( blinded , hardened , and made insensible to it ) .
AMPC	Romans	11	8	As it is written , God gave them a spirit ( an attitude ) of stupor , eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear , [ that has continued ] down to this very day . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	11	9	And David says , Let their table ( their feasting , banqueting ) become a snare and a trap , a pitfall and a [ a ] just retribution [ [ b ] rebounding like a boomerang upon them ] ; ( E )
AMPC	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened ( dimmed ) so that they can not see , and make them bend their back [ stooping beneath their burden ] forever . ( F )
AMPC	Romans	11	12	Now if their stumbling ( their lapse , their transgression ) has so enriched the world [ at large ] , and if [ Israel ’ s ] failure means such riches for the Gentiles , think what an enrichment and greater advantage will follow their full reinstatement !
AMPC	Romans	11	13	But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I lay great stress on my ministry and magnify my office ,
AMPC	Romans	11	14	In the hope of making my fellow Jews jealous [ in order to stir them up to imitate , copy , and appropriate ] , and thus managing to save some of them .
AMPC	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection and exclusion from the benefits of salvation were [ overruled ] for the reconciliation of a world to God , what will their acceptance and admission mean ? [ It will be nothing short of ] life from the dead !
AMPC	Romans	11	16	Now if the first handful of dough offered as the firstfruits [ Abraham and the patriarchs ] is consecrated ( holy ) , so is the whole mass [ the nation of Israel ] ; and if the root [ Abraham ] is consecrated ( holy ) , so are the branches . ( G )
AMPC	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off , while you , a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among them to share the richness [ of the root and sap ] of the olive tree ,
AMPC	Romans	11	18	Do not boast over the branches and pride yourself at their expense . If you do boast and feel superior , remember it is not you that support the root , but the root [ that supports ] you .
AMPC	Romans	11	19	You will say then , Branches were broken ( pruned ) off so that I might be grafted in !
AMPC	Romans	11	20	That is true . But they were broken ( pruned ) off because of their unbelief ( their lack of real faith ) , and you are established through faith [ because you do believe ] . So do not become proud and conceited , but rather stand in awe and be reverently afraid .
AMPC	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches [ because of unbelief ] , neither will He spare you [ if you are guilty of the same offense ] .
AMPC	Romans	11	22	Then note and appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God : severity toward those who have fallen , but God ’ s gracious kindness to you—provided you continue in His grace and abide in His kindness ; otherwise you too will be cut off ( pruned away ) .
AMPC	Romans	11	23	And even those others [ the fallen branches , Jews ] , if they do not persist in [ clinging to ] their unbelief , will be grafted in , for God has the power to graft them in again .
AMPC	Romans	11	24	For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and against nature grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much easier will it be to graft these natural [ branches ] back on [ the original parent stock of ] their own olive tree .
AMPC	Romans	11	25	Lest you be self-opinionated ( wise in your own conceits ) , I do not want you to miss this hidden truth and mystery , brethren : a hardening ( insensibility ) has [ temporarily ] befallen a part of Israel [ to last ] until the [ c ] full number of the ingathering of the Gentiles has come in ,
AMPC	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel will be saved . As it is written , The Deliverer will come from Zion , He will banish ungodliness from Jacob . ( H )
AMPC	Romans	11	27	And this will be My covenant ( My agreement ) with them when I shall take away their sins . ( I )
AMPC	Romans	11	28	From the point of view of the Gospel ( good news ) , they [ the Jews , at present ] are enemies [ of God ] , which is for your advantage and benefit . But from the point of view of God ’ s choice ( of election , of divine selection ) , they are still the beloved ( dear to Him ) for the sake of their forefathers .
AMPC	Romans	11	29	For God ’ s gifts and His call are irrevocable . [ He never withdraws them when once they are given , and He does not change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call . ]
AMPC	Romans	11	30	Just as you were once disobedient and rebellious toward God but now have obtained [ His ] mercy , through their disobedience ,
AMPC	Romans	11	31	So they also now are being disobedient [ when you are receiving mercy ] , that they in turn may one day , through the mercy you are enjoying , also receive mercy [ that they may share the mercy which has been shown to you—through you as messengers of the Gospel to them ] .
AMPC	Romans	11	32	For God has consigned ( penned up ) all men to disobedience , only that He may have mercy on them all [ alike ] .
AMPC	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unfathomable ( inscrutable , unsearchable ) are His judgments ( His decisions ) ! And how untraceable ( mysterious , undiscoverable ) are His ways ( His methods , His paths ) !
AMPC	Romans	11	34	For who has known the mind of the Lord and who has understood His thoughts , or who has [ ever ] been His counselor ? ( J )
AMPC	Romans	11	35	Or who has first given God anything that he might be paid back or that he could claim a recompense ?
AMPC	Romans	11	36	For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things . [ For all things originate with Him and come from Him ; all things live through Him , and all things center in and tend to consummate and to end in Him . ] To Him be glory forever ! Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes - Romans 11:9 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Romans 11:9 Literal translation : “ a return , a recompense. ” - Romans 11:25 Joseph Thayer , A Greek-English Lexicon .

AMPC	Romans	12	12	Rejoice and exult in hope ; be steadfast and patient in suffering and tribulation ; be constant in prayer .
AMPC	Romans	12	2	Do not be conformed to this world ( this age ) , [ fashioned after and adapted to its external , superficial customs ] , but be transformed ( changed ) by the [ entire ] renewal of your mind [ by its new ideals and its new attitude ] , so that you may prove [ for yourselves ] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God , even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [ in His sight for you ] .
AMPC	Romans	12	3	For by the grace ( unmerited favor of God ) given to me I warn everyone among you not to estimate and think of himself more highly than he ought [ not to have an exaggerated opinion of his own importance ] , but to rate his ability with sober judgment , each according to the degree of faith apportioned by God to him .
AMPC	Romans	12	4	For as in one physical body we have many parts ( organs , members ) and all of these parts do not have the same function or use ,
AMPC	Romans	12	5	So we , numerous as we are , are one body in Christ ( the Messiah ) and individually we are parts one of another [ mutually dependent on one another ] .
AMPC	Romans	12	6	Having gifts ( faculties , talents , qualities ) that differ according to the grace given us , let us use them : [ He whose gift is ] prophecy , [ let him prophesy ] according to the proportion of his faith ;
AMPC	Romans	12	7	[ He whose gift is ] practical service , let him give himself to serving ; he who teaches , to his teaching ;
AMPC	Romans	12	8	He who exhorts ( encourages ) , to his exhortation ; he who contributes , let him do it in simplicity and liberality ; he who gives aid and superintends , with zeal and singleness of mind ; he who does acts of mercy , with genuine cheerfulness and joyful eagerness .
AMPC	Romans	12	9	[ Let your ] love be sincere ( a real thing ) ; hate what is evil [ loathe all ungodliness , turn in horror from wickedness ] , but hold fast to that which is good .
AMPC	Romans	12	10	Love one another with brotherly affection [ as members of one family ] , giving precedence and showing honor to one another .
AMPC	Romans	12	11	Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor ; be aglow and burning with the Spirit , serving the Lord .
AMPC	Romans	12	13	Contribute to the needs of God ’ s people [ sharing in the necessities of the saints ] ; pursue the practice of hospitality .
AMPC	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you [ who are cruel in their attitude toward you ] ; bless and do not curse them .
AMPC	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice [ sharing others ’ joy ] , and weep with those who weep [ sharing others ’ grief ] .
AMPC	Romans	12	16	Live in harmony with one another ; do not be haughty ( snobbish , high-minded , exclusive ) , but readily adjust yourself to [ people , things ] and give yourselves to humble tasks . Never overestimate yourself or be wise in your own conceits . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	12	17	Repay no one evil for evil , but take thought for what is honest and proper and noble [ aiming to be above reproach ] in the sight of everyone . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	12	18	If possible , as far as it depends on you , live at peace with everyone .
AMPC	Romans	12	19	Beloved , never avenge yourselves , but leave the way open for [ God ’ s ] wrath ; for it is written , Vengeance is Mine , I will repay ( requite ) , says the Lord . ( C )
AMPC	Romans	12	20	But if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him drink ; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head . ( D )
AMPC	Romans	12	21	Do not let yourself be overcome by evil , but overcome ( master ) evil with good . Copyright ©

AMPC	Romans	13	13	Let us live and conduct ourselves honorably and becomingly as in the [ open light of ] day , not in reveling ( carousing ) and drunkenness , not in immorality and debauchery ( sensuality and licentiousness ) , not in quarreling and jealousy .
AMPC	Romans	13	2	Therefore he who resists and sets himself up against the authorities resists what God has appointed and arranged [ in divine order ] . And those who resist will bring down judgment upon themselves [ receiving the penalty due them ] .
AMPC	Romans	13	3	For civil authorities are not a terror to [ people of ] good conduct , but to [ those of ] bad behavior . Would you have no dread of him who is in authority ? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation .
AMPC	Romans	13	4	For he is God ’ s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , [ you should dread him and ] be afraid , for he does not bear and wear the sword for nothing . He is God ’ s servant to execute His wrath ( punishment , vengeance ) on the wrongdoer .
AMPC	Romans	13	5	Therefore one must be subject , not only to avoid God ’ s wrath and escape punishment , but also as a matter of principle and for the sake of conscience .
AMPC	Romans	13	6	For this same reason you pay taxes , for [ the civil authorities ] are official servants under God , devoting themselves to attending to this very service .
AMPC	Romans	13	7	Render to all men their dues . [ Pay ] taxes to whom taxes are due , revenue to whom revenue is due , respect to whom respect is due , and honor to whom honor is due .
AMPC	Romans	13	8	Keep out of debt and owe no man anything , except to love one another ; for he who loves his neighbor [ who practices loving others ] has fulfilled the Law [ relating to one ’ s fellowmen , meeting all its requirements ] .
AMPC	Romans	13	9	The commandments , You shall not commit adultery , You shall not kill , You shall not steal , You shall not covet ( have an evil desire ) , and any other commandment , are summed up in the single command , You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	13	10	Love does no wrong to one ’ s neighbor [ it never hurts anybody ] . Therefore love meets all the requirements and is the fulfilling of the Law .
AMPC	Romans	13	11	Besides this you know what [ a critical ] hour this is , how it is high time now for you to wake up out of your sleep ( rouse to reality ) . For salvation ( final deliverance ) is nearer to us now than when we first believed ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Christ , the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Romans	13	12	The night is far gone and the day is almost here . Let us then drop ( fling away ) the works and deeds of darkness and put on the [ full ] armor of light .
AMPC	Romans	13	14	But clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and make no provision for [ indulging ] the flesh [ put a stop to thinking about the evil cravings of your physical nature ] to [ gratify its ] desires ( lusts ) . Copyright ©

AMPC	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced ( persuaded ) as one in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is [ forbidden as ] essentially unclean ( defiled and unholy in itself ) . But [ none the less ] it is unclean ( defiled and unholy ) to anyone who thinks it is unclean .
AMPC	Romans	14	2	One [ man ’ s faith permits him to ] believe he may eat anything , while a weaker one [ limits his ] eating to vegetables .
AMPC	Romans	14	3	Let not him who eats look down on or despise him who abstains , and let not him who abstains criticize and pass judgment on him who eats ; for God has accepted and welcomed him .
AMPC	Romans	14	4	Who are you to pass judgment on and censure another ’ s household servant ? It is before his own master that he stands or falls . And he shall stand and be upheld , for the Master ( the Lord ) is mighty to support him and make him stand .
AMPC	Romans	14	5	One man esteems one day as better than another , while another man esteems all days alike [ sacred ] . Let everyone be fully convinced ( satisfied ) in his own mind .
AMPC	Romans	14	6	He who observes the day , observes it in honor of the Lord . He also who eats , eats in honor of the Lord , since he gives thanks to God ; while he who abstains , abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God .
AMPC	Romans	14	7	None of us lives to himself [ but to the Lord ] , and none of us dies to himself [ but to the Lord , for ]
AMPC	Romans	14	8	If we live , we live to the Lord , and if we die , we die to the Lord . So then , whether we live or we die , we belong to the Lord .
AMPC	Romans	14	9	For Christ died and lived again for this very purpose , that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
AMPC	Romans	14	10	Why do you criticize and pass judgment on your brother ? Or you , why do you look down upon or despise your brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God .
AMPC	Romans	14	11	For it is written , As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to Me , and every tongue shall confess to God [ acknowledge Him to His honor and to His praise ] . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	14	12	And so each of us shall give an account of himself [ give an answer in reference to judgment ] to God .
AMPC	Romans	14	13	Then let us no more criticize and blame and pass judgment on one another , but rather decide and endeavor never to put a stumbling block or an obstacle or a hindrance in the way of a brother .
AMPC	Romans	14	15	But if your brother is being pained or his feelings hurt or if he is being injured by what you eat , [ then ] you are no longer walking in love . [ You have ceased to be living and conducting yourself by the standard of love toward him . ] Do not let what you eat hurt or cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died !
AMPC	Romans	14	16	Do not therefore let what seems good to you be considered an evil thing [ by someone else ] . [ In other words , do not give occasion for others to criticize that which is justifiable for you . ]
AMPC	Romans	14	17	[ After all ] the kingdom of God is not a matter of [ getting the ] food and drink [ one likes ] , but instead it is righteousness ( that state which makes a person acceptable to God ) and [ heart ] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Romans	14	18	He who serves Christ in this way is acceptable and pleasing to God and is approved by men .
AMPC	Romans	14	19	So let us then definitely aim for and eagerly pursue what makes for harmony and for mutual upbuilding ( edification and development ) of one another .
AMPC	Romans	14	20	You must not , for the sake of food , undo and break down and destroy the work of God ! Everything is indeed [ ceremonially ] clean and pure , but it is wrong for anyone to hurt the conscience of others or to make them fall by what he eats .
AMPC	Romans	14	21	The right thing is to eat no meat or drink no wine [ at all ] , or [ do anything else ] if it makes your brother stumble or hurts his conscience or offends or weakens him .
AMPC	Romans	14	22	Your personal convictions [ on such matters ] —exercise [ them ] as in God ’ s presence , keeping them to yourself [ striving only to know the truth and obey His will ] . Blessed ( happy , [ a ] to be envied ) is he who has no reason to judge himself for what he approves [ who does not convict himself by what he chooses to do ] .
AMPC	Romans	14	23	But the man who has doubts ( misgivings , an uneasy conscience ) about eating , and then eats [ perhaps because of you ] , stands condemned [ before God ] , because he is not true to his convictions and he does not act from faith . For whatever does not originate and proceed from faith is sin [ whatever is done without a conviction of its approval by God is sinful ] . Footnotes - Romans 14:22 Alexander Souter , Pocket Lexicon .

AMPC	Romans	15	15	Still on some points I have written to you the more boldly and unreservedly by way of reminder . [ I have done so ] because of the grace ( the unmerited favor ) bestowed on me by God
AMPC	Romans	15	2	Let each one of us make it a practice to please ( make happy ) his neighbor for his good and for his true welfare , to edify him [ to strengthen him and build him up spiritually ] .
AMPC	Romans	15	3	For Christ did not please Himself [ gave no thought to His own interests ] ; but , as it is written , The reproaches and abuses of those who reproached and abused you fell on Me . ( A )
AMPC	Romans	15	4	For whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction , that by [ our steadfast and patient ] endurance and the encouragement [ drawn ] from the Scriptures we might hold fast to and cherish hope .
AMPC	Romans	15	5	Now may the God Who gives the power of patient endurance ( steadfastness ) and Who supplies encouragement , grant you to live in such mutual harmony and such full sympathy with one another , in accord with Christ Jesus ,
AMPC	Romans	15	6	That together you may [ unanimously ] with united hearts and one voice , praise and glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Romans	15	7	Welcome and receive [ to your hearts ] one another , then , even as Christ has welcomed and received you , for the glory of God .
AMPC	Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ ( the Messiah ) became a servant and a minister to the circumcised ( the Jews ) in order to show God ’ s truthfulness and honesty by confirming ( verifying ) the promises [ given ] to our fathers ,
AMPC	Romans	15	9	And [ also in order ] that the Gentiles ( nations ) might glorify God for His mercy [ not covenanted ] to them . As it is written , Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to Your name . ( B )
AMPC	Romans	15	10	Again it is said , Rejoice ( exult ) , O Gentiles , along with His [ own ] people ; ( C )
AMPC	Romans	15	11	And again , Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise Him ! ( D )
AMPC	Romans	15	12	And further Isaiah says , There shall be a [ a ] Sprout from the Root of Jesse , He Who rises to rule over the Gentiles ; in Him shall the Gentiles hope . ( E )
AMPC	Romans	15	13	May the God of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing [ through the experience of your faith ] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound and be overflowing ( bubbling over ) with hope .
AMPC	Romans	15	14	Personally I am satisfied about you , my brethren , that you yourselves are rich in goodness , amply filled with all [ spiritual ] knowledge and competent to admonish and counsel and instruct one another also .
AMPC	Romans	15	16	In making me a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I act in the priestly service of the Gospel ( the good news ) of God , in order that the sacrificial offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable [ to God ] , consecrated and made holy by the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Romans	15	17	In Christ Jesus , then , I have legitimate reason to glory ( exult ) in my work for God [ in what through Christ Jesus I have accomplished concerning the things of God ] .
AMPC	Romans	15	18	For [ of course ] I will not venture ( presume ) to speak thus of any work except what Christ has actually done through me [ as an instrument in His hands ] to win obedience from the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
AMPC	Romans	15	19	[ Even as my preaching has been accompanied ] with the power of signs and wonders , [ and all of it ] by the power of the Holy Spirit . [ The result is ] that starting from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum , I have fully preached the Gospel [ faithfully executing , accomplishing , carrying out to the full the good news ] of Christ ( the Messiah ) in its entirety .
AMPC	Romans	15	20	Thus my ambition has been to preach the Gospel , not where Christ ’ s name has already been known , lest I build on another man ’ s foundation ;
AMPC	Romans	15	21	But [ instead I would act on the principle ] as it is written , They shall see who have never been told of Him , and they shall understand who have never heard [ of Him ] . ( F )
AMPC	Romans	15	22	This [ ambition ] is the reason why I have so frequently been hindered from coming to visit you .
AMPC	Romans	15	23	But now since I have no further opportunity for work in these regions , and since I have longed for [ b ] enough years to come to you ,
AMPC	Romans	15	24	I hope to see you in passing [ through Rome ] as I go [ on my intended trip ] to Spain , and to be aided on my journey there by you , after I have enjoyed your company for a little while .
AMPC	Romans	15	25	For the present , however , I am going to Jerusalem to bring aid ( relief ) for the saints ( God ’ s people there ) .
AMPC	Romans	15	26	For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the saints of Jerusalem .
AMPC	Romans	15	27	They were pleased to do it ; and surely they are in debt to them , for if these Gentiles have come to share in their [ the Jerusalem Jews ’ ] spiritual blessings , then they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings .
AMPC	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have completed this mission and have delivered to them [ at Jerusalem ] what has been raised , I shall go on by way of you to Spain .
AMPC	Romans	15	29	And I know that when I do come to you , I shall come in the abundant blessing of the Gospel of Christ .
AMPC	Romans	15	30	I appeal to you [ I entreat you ] , brethren , for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love [ given by ] the Spirit , to unite with me in earnest wrestling in prayer to God in my behalf .
AMPC	Romans	15	31	[ Pray ] that I may be delivered ( rescued ) from the unbelievers in Judea and that my mission of relief to Jerusalem may be acceptable and graciously received by the saints ( God ’ s people there ) ,
AMPC	Romans	15	32	So that by God ’ s will I may subsequently come to you with joy ( with a happy heart ) and be refreshed [ by the interval of rest ] in your company .
AMPC	Romans	15	33	May [ our ] peace-giving God be with you all ! Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes - Romans 15:12 G. Abbott-Smith , Manual Greek Lexicon . - Romans 15:23 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . Copyright ©

AMPC	Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a holy ( consecrated ) kiss . All the churches of Christ ( the Messiah ) wish to be remembered to you .
AMPC	Romans	16	2	That you may receive her in the Lord [ with a Christian welcome ] , as saints ( God ’ s people ) ought to receive one another . And help her in whatever matter she may require assistance from you , for she has been a helper of many including myself [ shielding us from suffering ] .
AMPC	Romans	16	3	Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila , my fellow workers in Christ Jesus ,
AMPC	Romans	16	4	Who risked their lives [ endangering their very necks ] for my life . To them not only I but also all the churches among the Gentiles give thanks .
AMPC	Romans	16	5	[ Remember me ] also to the church [ that meets ] in their house . Greet my beloved Epaenetus , who was a firstfruit ( first convert ) to Christ in Asia .
AMPC	Romans	16	6	Greet Mary , who has worked so hard among you .
AMPC	Romans	16	7	Remember me to Andronicus and Junias , my tribal kinsmen and once my fellow prisoners . They are men held in high esteem among the apostles , who also were in Christ before I was .
AMPC	Romans	16	8	Remember me to Ampliatus , my beloved in the Lord .
AMPC	Romans	16	9	Salute Urbanus , our fellow worker in Christ , and my dear Stachys .
AMPC	Romans	16	10	Greet Apelles , that one tried and approved in Christ ( the Messiah ) . Remember me to those who belong to the household of Aristobulus .
AMPC	Romans	16	11	Greet my tribal kinsman Herodion , and those in the Lord who belong to the household of Narcissus .
AMPC	Romans	16	12	Salute those workers in the Lord , Tryphaena and Tryphosa . Greet my dear Persis , who has worked so hard in the Lord .
AMPC	Romans	16	13	Remember me to Rufus , eminent in the Lord , also to his mother [ who has been ] a mother to me as well .
AMPC	Romans	16	14	Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas , and the brethren who are with them .
AMPC	Romans	16	15	Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints who are with them .
AMPC	Romans	16	17	I appeal to you , brethren , to be on your guard concerning those who create dissensions and difficulties and cause divisions , in opposition to the doctrine ( the teaching ) which you have been taught . [ I warn you to turn aside from them , to ] avoid them .
AMPC	Romans	16	18	For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites and base desires , and by ingratiating and flattering speech , they beguile the hearts of the unsuspecting and simpleminded [ people ] .
AMPC	Romans	16	19	For while your loyalty and obedience is known to all , so that I rejoice over you , I would have you well versed and wise as to what is good and innocent and guileless as to what is evil .
AMPC	Romans	16	20	And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you .
AMPC	Romans	16	21	Timothy , my fellow worker , wishes to be remembered to you , as do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater , my tribal kinsmen .
AMPC	Romans	16	22	I , Tertius , the writer of this letter , greet you in the Lord .
AMPC	Romans	16	23	Gaius , who is host to me and to the whole church here , greets you . So do Erastus , the city treasurer , and our brother Quartus .
AMPC	Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	Romans	16	25	Now to Him Who is able to strengthen you in the faith which is in accordance with my Gospel and the preaching of ( concerning ) Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , according to the revelation ( the unveiling ) of the mystery of the plan of redemption which was kept in silence and secret for long ages ,
AMPC	Romans	16	26	But is now disclosed and through the prophetic Scriptures is made known to all nations , according to the command of the eternal God , [ to win them ] to obedience to the faith ,
AMPC	Romans	16	27	To [ the ] only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) ! Amen ( so be it ) . Copyright ©

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Corinthians 1:7 Joseph Thayer , A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church ( assembly ) of God which is in Corinth , to those consecrated and purified and made holy in Christ Jesus , [ who are ] selected and called to be saints ( God ’ s people ) , together with all those who in any place call upon and give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , both their Lord and ours :
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) be to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace ( the favor and spiritual blessing ) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	5	[ So ] that in Him in every respect you were enriched , in full power and readiness of speech [ to speak of your faith ] and complete knowledge and illumination [ to give you full insight into its meaning ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	6	In this way [ our ] witnessing concerning Christ ( the Messiah ) was so confirmed and established and made sure in you
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	7	That you are not [ consciously ] falling behind or lacking in any special spiritual endowment or Christian grace [ [ a ] the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit ] , while you wait and watch [ constantly living in hope ] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and [ His ] being made visible to all .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	8	And He will establish you to the end [ keep you steadfast , give you strength , and guarantee your vindication ; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be ] guiltless and irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful ( reliable , trustworthy , and therefore ever true to His promise , and He can be depended on ) ; by Him you were called into companionship and participation with His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	10	But I urge and entreat you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you be in perfect harmony and full agreement in what you say , and that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you , but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions and judgments .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it has been made clear to me , my brethren , by those of Chloe ’ s household , that there are contentions and wrangling and factions among you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	12	What I mean is this , that each one of you [ either ] says , I belong to Paul , or I belong to Apollos , or I belong to Cephas ( Peter ) , or I belong to Christ .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ ( the Messiah ) divided into parts ? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you ? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	15	Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	16	[ Yes ] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also . More than these , I do not remember that I baptized anyone .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ ( the Messiah ) sent me out not to baptize but [ to evangelize by ] preaching the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) , and that not with verbal eloquence , lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vain ( fruitless , void of value , and of no effect ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition , but to us who are being saved it is the [ manifestation of ] the power of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , I will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the learned and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the discernment of the discerning ; I will frustrate and nullify [ them ] and bring [ them ] to nothing . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise man ( the philosopher ) ? Where is the scribe ( the scholar ) ? Where is the investigator ( the logician , the debater ) of this present time and age ? Has not God shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world ’ s wisdom ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know God by means of its own philosophy , God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [ salvation , procured by Christ and to be had through Him ] , to save those who believed ( who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For while Jews [ demandingly ] ask for signs and miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy and wisdom ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	23	We preach Christ ( the Messiah ) crucified , [ preaching which ] to the Jews is a scandal and an offensive stumbling block [ that springs a snare or trap ] , and to the Gentiles it is absurd and utterly unphilosophical nonsense .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But to those who are called , whether Jew or Greek ( Gentile ) , Christ [ is ] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	25	[ This is ] because the foolish thing [ that has its source in ] God is wiser than men , and the weak thing [ that springs ] from God is stronger than men .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For [ simply ] consider your own call , brethren ; not many [ of you were considered to be ] wise according to human estimates and standards , not many influential and powerful , not many of high and noble birth .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	27	[ No ] for God selected ( deliberately chose ) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame , and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And God also selected ( deliberately chose ) what in the world is lowborn and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt , even the things that are nothing , that He might depose and bring to nothing the things that are ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	29	So that no mortal man should [ have pretense for glorying and ] boast in the presence of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus , Whom God made our Wisdom from God , [ revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden , manifesting itself as ] our Righteousness [ thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God ] , and our Consecration [ making us pure and holy ] , and our Redemption [ providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	1	31	So then , as it is written , Let him who boasts and proudly rejoices and glories , boast and proudly rejoice and glory in the Lord . ( B ) Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians 2:15 Joseph P. Lightfoot , Notes on the Epistles of Saint Paul . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I resolved to know nothing ( to be acquainted with nothing , to make a display of the knowledge of nothing , and to be conscious of nothing ) among you except Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and Him crucified .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was in ( [ b ] passed into a state of ) weakness and fear ( dread ) and great trembling [ [ c ] after I had come ] among you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive ( enticing and plausible ) words of wisdom , but they were in demonstration of the [ Holy ] Spirit and power [ [ d ] a proof by the Spirit and power of God , operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them ] ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	5	So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men ( human philosophy ) , but in the power of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet when we are among the full-grown ( spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding ) , we do impart a [ higher ] wisdom ( the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden ) ; but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age or of this world nor of the leaders and rulers of this age , who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden [ from the human understanding ] and now revealed to us by God— [ that wisdom ] which God devised and decreed before the ages for our glorification [ to lift us into the glory of His presence ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this age or world perceived and recognized and understood this , for if they had , they would never have crucified the Lord of glory .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But , on the contrary , as the Scripture says , What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man , [ all that ] God has prepared ( made and keeps ready ) for those who love Him [ [ e ] who hold Him in affectionate reverence , promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed ] . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	10	Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit , for the [ Holy ] Spirit searches diligently , exploring and examining everything , even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God [ the [ f ] divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man ’ s scrutiny ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what person perceives ( knows and understands ) what passes through a man ’ s thoughts except the man ’ s own spirit within him ? Just so no one discerns ( comes to know and comprehend ) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have not received the spirit [ that belongs to ] the world , but the [ Holy ] Spirit Who is from God , [ given to us ] that we might realize and comprehend and appreciate the gifts [ of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly ] bestowed on us by God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	13	And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the [ Holy ] Spirit , combining and interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language [ to those who possess the Holy Spirit ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the natural , nonspiritual man does not accept or welcome or admit into his heart the gifts and teachings and revelations of the Spirit of God , for they are folly ( meaningless nonsense ) to him ; and he is incapable of knowing them [ of progressively recognizing , understanding , and becoming better acquainted with them ] because they are spiritually discerned and estimated and appreciated .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But the spiritual man tries all things [ he [ g ] examines , investigates , inquires into , questions , and discerns all things ] , yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one [ he can read the meaning of everything , but no one can properly discern or appraise or get an insight into him ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who has known or understood the mind ( the counsels and purposes ) of the Lord so as to guide and instruct Him and give Him knowledge ? But we have the mind of Christ ( the Messiah ) and do hold the thoughts ( feelings and purposes ) of His heart . ( B ) Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	3	For you are still [ unspiritual , having the nature ] of the flesh [ under the control of ordinary impulses ] . For as long as [ there are ] envying and jealousy and wrangling and factions among you , are you not unspiritual and of the flesh , behaving yourselves after a human standard and like mere ( unchanged ) men ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk , not solid food , for you were not yet strong enough [ to be ready for it ] ; but even yet you are not strong enough [ to be ready for it ] ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one says , I belong to Paul , and another , I belong to Apollos , are you not [ proving yourselves ] ordinary ( unchanged ) men ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? Ministering servants [ not heads of parties ] through whom you believed , even as the Lord appointed to each his task :
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered , but God [ all the while ] was making it grow and [ He ] gave the increase .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters , but [ only ] God Who makes it grow and become greater .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	8	He who plants and he who waters are equal ( one in aim , of the same importance and esteem ) , yet each shall receive his own reward ( wages ) , according to his own labor .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are fellow workmen ( joint promoters , laborers together ) with and for God ; you are God ’ s [ b ] garden and vineyard and field under cultivation , [ you are ] God ’ s building . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace ( the special endowment for my task ) of God bestowed on me , like a skillful architect and master builder I laid [ the ] foundation , and now another [ man ] is building upon it . But let each [ man ] be careful how he builds upon it ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is [ already ] laid , which is Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	12	But if anyone builds upon the Foundation , whether it be with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	13	The work of each [ one ] will become [ plainly , openly ] known ( shown for what it is ) ; for the day [ of Christ ] will disclose and declare it , because it will be revealed with fire , and the fire will test and critically appraise the character and worth of the work each person has done .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the work which any person has built on this Foundation [ any product of his efforts whatever ] survives [ this test ] , he will get his reward .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	15	But if any person ’ s work is burned up [ under the test ] , he will suffer the loss [ of it all , losing his reward ] , though he himself will be saved , but only as [ one who has passed ] through fire . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Do you not discern and understand that you [ the whole church at Corinth ] are God ’ s temple ( His sanctuary ) , and that God ’ s Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you [ to be at home in you , [ c ] collectively as a church and also individually ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone [ d ] does hurt to God ’ s temple or corrupts it [ [ e ] with false doctrines ] or destroys it , God will [ f ] do hurt to him and bring him to the corruption of death and destroy him . For the temple of God is holy ( sacred to Him ) and that [ temple ] you [ [ g ] the believing church and its individual believers ] are .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no person deceive himself . If anyone among you supposes that he is wise in this age , let him become a fool [ let him discard his worldly discernment and recognize himself as dull , stupid , and foolish , without true learning and scholarship ] , that he may become [ really ] wise . ( C )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For this world ’ s wisdom is foolishness ( absurdity and stupidity ) with God , for it is written , He lays hold of the wise in their [ own ] craftiness ; ( D )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	20	And again , The Lord knows the thoughts and reasonings of the [ humanly ] wise and recognizes how futile they are . ( E )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So let no one exult proudly concerning men [ boasting of having this or that man as a leader ] , for all things are yours ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas ( Peter ) , or the universe or life or death , or the immediate and [ h ] threatening present or the [ subsequent and uncertain ] future—all are yours ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	3	23	And you are Christ ’ s , and Christ is God ’ s . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians 4:20 Joseph Thayer , A Greek-English Lexicon . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I am not conscious of anything against myself , and I feel blameless ; but I am not vindicated and acquitted before God on that account . It is the Lord [ Himself ] Who examines and judges me .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Moreover , it is [ essentially ] required of stewards that a man should be found faithful [ proving himself worthy of trust ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But [ as for me personally ] it matters very little to me that I should be put on trial by you [ on this point ] , and that you or any other human tribunal should investigate and question and cross-question me . I do not even put myself on trial and judge myself .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So do not make any hasty or premature judgments before the time when the Lord comes [ again ] , for He will both bring to light the secret things that are [ now hidden ] in darkness and disclose and expose the [ secret ] aims ( motives and purposes ) of hearts . Then every man will receive his [ due ] commendation from God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now I have applied all this [ about parties and factions ] to myself and Apollos for your sakes , brethren , so that from what I have said of us [ as illustrations ] , you may learn [ to think of men in accordance with Scripture and ] not to go beyond that which is written , that none of you may be puffed up and inflated with pride and boast in favor of one [ minister and teacher ] against another .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who separates you from the others [ as a faction leader ] ? [ Who makes you superior and sets you apart from another , giving you the preeminence ? ] What have you that was not given to you ? If then you received it [ from someone ] , why do you boast as if you had not received [ but had gained it by your own efforts ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	8	[ [ a ] You behave as if ] you are already filled and think you have enough [ you are full and content , feeling no need of anything more ] ! Already you have become rich [ in spiritual gifts and graces ] ! [ Without any counsel or instruction from us , in your conceit ] , you have ascended your thrones and come into your kingdom without including us ! And would that it were true and that you did reign , so that we might be sharing the kingdom with you !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For it seems to me that God has made an exhibit of us apostles , exposing us to view last [ of all , like men in a triumphal procession who are ] sentenced to death [ and displayed at the end of the line ] . For we have become a spectacle to the world [ a show in the world ’ s amphitheater ] with both men and angels [ as spectators ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are [ looked upon as ] fools on account of Christ and for His sake , but you are [ supposedly ] so amazingly wise and prudent in Christ ! We are weak , but you are [ so very ] strong ! You are highly esteemed , but we are in disrepute and contempt !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To this hour we have gone both hungry and thirsty ; we [ [ b ] habitually ] wear but one undergarment [ and shiver in the cold ] ; we are roughly knocked about and wander around homeless .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	12	And we still toil unto weariness [ for our living ] , working hard with our own hands . When men revile us [ [ c ] wound us with an accursed sting ] , we bless them . When we are persecuted , we take it patiently and endure it .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When we are slandered and defamed , we [ try to ] answer softly and bring comfort . We have been made and are now the rubbish and filth of the world [ the offscouring of all things , the scum of the earth ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I do not write this to shame you , but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	15	After all , though you should have ten thousand teachers ( guides to direct you ) in Christ , yet you do not have many fathers . For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	16	So I urge and implore you , be imitators of me .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this very cause I sent to you Timothy , who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord , who will recall to your minds my methods of proceeding and course of conduct and way of life in Christ , such as I teach everywhere in each of the churches .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you have become conceited and arrogant and pretentious , counting on my not coming to you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you [ and ] shortly , if the Lord is willing , and then I will perceive and understand not what the talk of these puffed up and arrogant spirits amount to , but their force ( [ d ] the moral power and excellence of soul they really possess ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God consists of and is based on not talk but power ( [ e ] moral power and excellence of soul ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	4	21	Now which do you prefer ? Shall I come to you with a rod of correction , or with love and in a spirit of gentleness ? Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	5	You are to deliver this man over to Satan [ a ] for physical discipline [ to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest ] , that [ his ] spirit may [ yet ] be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you are proud and arrogant ! And you ought rather to mourn ( bow in sorrow and in shame ) until the person who has done this [ shameful ] thing is removed from your fellowship and your midst !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	3	As for my attitude , though I am absent [ from you ] in body , I am present in spirit , and I have already decided and passed judgment , as if actually present ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , on the man who has committed such a deed . When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	6	[ About the condition of your church ] your boasting is not good [ indeed , it is most unseemly and entirely out of place ] . Do you not know that [ just ] a little leaven will ferment the whole lump [ of dough ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Purge ( clean out ) the old leaven that you may be fresh ( new ) dough , still uncontaminated [ as you are ] , for Christ , our Passover [ Lamb ] , has been sacrificed .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore , let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , nor with leaven of vice and malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened [ bread ] of purity ( nobility , honor ) and sincerity and [ unadulterated ] truth . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote you in my [ previous ] letter not to associate [ closely and habitually ] with unchaste ( impure ) people—
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	10	Not [ meaning of course that you must ] altogether shun the immoral people of this world , or the greedy graspers and cheats and thieves or idolaters , since otherwise you would need to get out of the world and human society altogether !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of [ Christian ] brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed , or is an idolater [ whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God ] , or is a person with a foul tongue [ railing , abusing , reviling , slandering ] , or is a drunkard or a swindler or a robber . [ No ] you must not so much as eat with such a person .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	12	What [ business ] of mine is it and what right have I to judge outsiders ? Is it not those inside [ the church ] upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment [ passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	5	13	God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside . Drive out that wicked one from among you [ expel him from your church ] . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But brother goes to law against brother , and that before [ Gentile judges who are ] unbelievers [ without faith or trust in the Gospel of Christ ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Do you not know that the saints ( the believers ) will [ one day ] judge and govern the world ? And if the world [ itself ] is to be judged and ruled by you , are you unworthy and incompetent to try [ such petty matters ] of the smallest courts of justice ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do you not know also that we [ Christians ] are to judge the [ very ] angels and pronounce opinion between right and wrong [ for them ] ? How much more then [ as to ] matters pertaining to this world and of this life only !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If then you do have such cases of everyday life to decide , why do you appoint [ as judges to lay them before ] those who [ from the standpoint ] of the church count for least and are without standing ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to move you to shame . Can it be that there really is not one man among you who [ in action is governed by piety and integrity and ] is wise and competent enough to decide [ the private grievances , disputes , and quarrels ] between members of the brotherhood ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Why , the very fact of your having lawsuits with one another at all is a defect ( a defeat , an evidence of positive moral loss for you ) . Why not rather let yourselves suffer wrong and be deprived of what is your due ? Why not rather be cheated ( defrauded and robbed ) ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But [ instead it is you ] yourselves who wrong and defraud , and that even your own brethren [ by so treating them ] !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Do you not know that the unrighteous and the wrongdoers will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ( misled ) : neither the impure and immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor those who participate in homosexuality ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	10	Nor cheats ( swindlers and thieves ) , nor greedy graspers , nor drunkards , nor foulmouthed revilers and slanderers , nor extortioners and robbers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such some of you were [ once ] . But you were washed clean ( purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin ) , and you were consecrated ( set apart , hallowed ) , and you were justified [ pronounced righteous , by trusting ] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [ Holy ] Spirit of our God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	12	Everything is permissible ( allowable and lawful ) for me ; but not all things are helpful ( good for me to do , expedient and profitable when considered with other things ) . Everything is lawful for me , but I will not become the slave of anything or be brought under its power .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Food [ is intended ] for the stomach and the stomach for food , but God will finally end [ the functions of ] both and bring them to nothing . The body is not intended for sexual immorality , but [ is intended ] for the Lord , and the Lord [ is intended ] for the body [ [ a ] to save , sanctify , and raise it again ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God both raised the Lord to life and will also raise us up by His power .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Do you not see and know that your bodies are members ( bodily parts ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) ? Am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make [ them ] parts of a prostitute ? Never ! Never !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Or do you not know and realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute , he becomes one body with her ? The two , it is written , shall become one flesh . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But the person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Shun immorality and all sexual looseness [ flee from impurity in thought , word , or deed ] . Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body , but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Do you not know that your body is the temple ( the very sanctuary ) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within you , Whom you have received [ as a Gift ] from God ? You are not your own ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	6	20	You were bought with a price [ purchased with a [ b ] preciousness and paid for , [ c ] made His own ] . So then , honor God and bring glory to Him in your body . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish that all men were like I myself am [ in this matter of self-control ] . But each has his own special gift from God , one of this kind and one of another .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because of the temptation to impurity and to avoid immorality , let each [ man ] have his own wife and let each [ woman ] have her own husband .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights ( goodwill , kindness , and what is due her as his wife ) , and likewise the wife to her husband .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	4	For the wife does not have [ exclusive ] authority and control over her own body , but the husband [ has his rights ] ; likewise also the husband does not have [ exclusive ] authority and control over his body , but the wife [ has her rights ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not refuse and deprive and defraud each other [ of your due marital rights ] , except perhaps by mutual consent for a time , so that you may devote yourselves unhindered to prayer . But afterwards resume marital relations , lest Satan tempt you [ to sin ] through your lack of restraint of sexual desire . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I am saying this more as a matter of permission and concession , not as a command or regulation .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But to the unmarried people and to the widows , I declare that it is well ( good , advantageous , expedient , and wholesome ) for them to remain [ single ] even as I do .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they have not self-control ( restraint of their passions ) , they should marry . For it is better to marry than to be aflame [ with passion and tortured continually with ungratified desire ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But to the married people I give charge—not I but the Lord—that the wife is not to separate from her husband .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she does [ separate from and divorce him ] , let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband . And [ I charge ] the husband [ also ] that he should not put away or divorce his wife .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	12	To the rest I declare—I , not the Lord [ for Jesus did not discuss this ] —that if any brother has a wife who does not believe [ in Christ ] and she consents to live with him , he should not leave or divorce her .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her , she should not leave or divorce him .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is set apart ( separated , withdrawn from heathen contamination , and affiliated with the Christian people ) by union with his consecrated ( set-apart ) wife , and the unbelieving wife is set apart and separated through union with her consecrated husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean ( unblessed heathen , [ a ] outside the Christian covenant ) , but as it is they are [ b ] prepared for God [ pure and clean ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving partner [ actually ] leaves , let him do so ; in such [ cases the remaining ] brother or sister is not morally bound . But God has called us to peace .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For , wife , how can you be sure of converting and saving your husband ? Husband , how can you be sure of converting and saving your wife ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only , let each one [ seek to conduct himself and regulate his affairs so as to ] lead the life which the Lord has allotted and imparted to him and to which God has invited and summoned him . This is my order in all the churches .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone at the time of his summons [ from God ] already circumcised ? Let him not seek to remove the evidence of circumcision . Was anyone at the time [ God ] called him uncircumcised ? Let him not be circumcised .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	19	For circumcision is nothing and counts for nothing , neither does uncircumcision , but [ what counts is ] keeping the commandments of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Everyone should remain after God calls him in the station or condition of life in which the summons found him .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called ? Do not let that trouble you . But if you are able to gain your freedom , avail yourself of the opportunity .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he who as a slave was summoned in [ to union with ] the Lord is a freedman of the Lord , just so he who was free when he was called is a bond servant of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were bought with a price [ purchased with a preciousness and paid for by Christ ] ; then do not yield yourselves up to become [ in your own estimation ] slaves to men [ but consider yourselves slaves to Christ ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	24	So , brethren , in whatever station or state or condition of life each one was when he was called , there let him continue with and close to God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning the virgins ( the marriageable [ c ] maidens ) I have no command of the Lord , but I give my opinion and advice as one who by the Lord ’ s mercy is rendered trustworthy and faithful .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think then , because of the impending distress [ that is even now setting in ] , it is well ( expedient , profitable , and wholesome ) for a person to remain as he or she is .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you do marry , you do not sin [ in doing so ] , and if a virgin marries , she does not sin [ in doing so ] . Yet those who marry will have physical and earthly troubles , and I would like to spare you that .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	29	I mean , brethren , the appointed time has been [ d ] winding down and it has grown very short . From now on , let even those who have wives be as if they had none ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	30	And those who weep and mourn as though they were not weeping and mourning , and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing , and those who buy as though they did not possess anything ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	31	And those who deal with this world [ [ e ] overusing the enjoyments of this life ] as though they were not absorbed by it and as if they had no dealings with it . For the outward form of this world ( the present world order ) is passing away .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	32	My desire is to have you free from all anxiety and distressing care . The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But the married man is anxious about worldly matters—how he may please his wife—
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	34	And he is drawn in diverging directions [ his interests are divided and he is distracted from his devotion to God ] . And the unmarried woman or girl is concerned and anxious about the matters of the Lord , how to be wholly separated and set apart in body and spirit ; but the married woman has her cares [ centered ] in earthly affairs—how she may please her husband .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	35	Now I say this for your own welfare and profit , not to put [ a halter of ] restraint upon you , but to promote what is seemly and in good order and to secure your undistracted and undivided devotion to the Lord .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward and in regard to his virgin [ that he is preparing disgrace for her or incurring reproach ] , in case she is passing the bloom of her youth and if there is need for it , let him do what to him seems right ; he does not sin ; let them marry .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But whoever is firmly established in his heart [ strong in mind and purpose ] , not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will and desire , and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity , he is doing well .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So also then , he [ the father ] who gives his virgin ( his daughter ) in marriage does well , and he [ the father ] who does not give [ her ] in marriage does better .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives . If the husband dies , she is free to be married to whom she will , only [ provided that he too is ] in the Lord .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But in my opinion [ a widow ] is happier ( more blessed and [ f ] to be envied ) if she does not remarry . And also I think I have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	8	Now food [ itself ] will not cause our acceptance by God nor commend us to Him . Eating [ food offered to idols ] gives us no advantage ; neither do we come short or become any worse if we do not eat [ it ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If anyone imagines that he has come to know and understand much [ of divine things , without love ] , he does not yet perceive and recognize and understand as strongly and clearly , nor has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought or as is necessary .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if one loves God truly [ [ a ] with affectionate reverence , prompt obedience , and grateful recognition of His blessing ] , he is known by God [ [ b ] recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love , and he is owned by Him ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	4	In this matter , then , of eating food offered to idols , we know that an idol is nothing ( has no real existence ) and that there is no God but one . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For although there may be so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth , as indeed there are many of them , both of gods and of lords and masters ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	6	Yet for us there is [ only ] one God , the Father , Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we [ have life ] , and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through and by Whom are all things and through and by Whom we [ ourselves exist ] . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	7	Nevertheless , not all [ believers ] possess this knowledge . But some , through being all their lives until now accustomed to [ thinking of ] idols [ as real and living ] , still consider the food [ offered to an idol ] as that sacrificed to an [ actual ] god ; and their weak consciences become defiled and injured if they eat [ it ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	9	Only be careful that this power of choice ( this permission and liberty to do as you please ) which is yours , does not [ somehow ] become a hindrance ( cause of stumbling ) to the weak or overscrupulous [ giving them an impulse to sin ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For suppose someone sees you , a man having knowledge [ of God , with an intelligent view of this subject and ] reclining at table in an idol ’ s temple , might he not be encouraged and emboldened [ to violate his own conscientious scruples ] if he is weak and uncertain , and eat what [ to him ] is for the purpose of idol worship ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	11	And so by your enlightenment ( your knowledge of spiritual things ) , this weak man is ruined ( is lost and perishes ) —the brother for whom Christ ( the Messiah ) died !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	12	And when you sin against your brethren in this way , wounding and damaging their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , if [ my eating a ] food is a cause of my brother ’ s falling or of hindering [ his spiritual advancement ] , I will not eat [ such ] flesh forever , lest I cause my brother to be tripped up and fall and to be offended . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For in the Law of Moses it is written , You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn . Is it [ only ] for oxen that God cares ? ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	2	Even if I am not considered an apostle ( a special messenger ) by others , at least I am one to you ; for you are the seal ( the certificate , the living evidence ) of my apostleship in the Lord [ confirming and authenticating it ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	3	This is my [ real ground of ] defense ( my vindication of myself ) to those who would put me on trial and cross-examine me .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Have we not the right to our food and drink [ at the expense of the churches ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Have we not the right also to take along with us a Christian sister as wife , as do the other apostles and the Lord ’ s brothers and Cephas ( Peter ) ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from doing manual labor for a livelihood [ in order to go about the work of the ministry ] ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	7	[ Consider this : ] What soldier at any time serves at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of the fruit of it ? Who tends a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Do I say this only on human authority and as a man reasons ? Does not the Law endorse the same principle ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or does He speak certainly and entirely for our sakes ? [ Assuredly ] it is written for our sakes , because the plowman ought to plow in hope , and the thresher ought to thresh in expectation of partaking of the harvest .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown [ the seed of ] spiritual good among you , [ is it too ] much if we reap from your material benefits ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others share in this rightful claim upon you , do not we [ have a still better and greater claim ] ? However , we have never exercised this right , but we endure everything rather than put a hindrance in the way [ of the spread ] of the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do you not know that those men who are employed in the services of the temple get their food from the temple ? And that those who tend the altar share with the altar [ in the offerings brought ] ? ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	14	[ On the same principle ] the Lord directed that those who publish the good news ( the Gospel ) should live ( get their maintenance ) by the Gospel .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not made use of any of these privileges , nor am I writing this [ to suggest ] that any such provision be made for me [ now ] . For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone make void and deprive me of my [ ground for ] glorifying [ in this matter ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I [ merely ] preach the Gospel , that gives me no reason to boast , for I feel compelled of necessity to do it . Woe is me if I do not preach the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this work of my own free will , then I have my pay ( my reward ) ; but if it is not of my own will , but is done reluctantly and under compulsion , I am [ still ] entrusted with a [ sacred ] trusteeship and commission .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is the [ actual ] reward that I get ? Just this : that in my preaching the good news ( the Gospel ) , I may offer it [ absolutely ] free of expense [ to anybody ] , not taking advantage of my rights and privileges [ as a preacher ] of the Gospel .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For although I am free in every way from anyone ’ s control , I have made myself a bond servant to everyone , so that I might gain the more [ for Christ ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might win Jews ; to men under the Law , [ I became ] as one under the Law , though not myself being under the Law , that I might win those under the Law .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those without ( outside ) law I became as one without law , not that I am without the law of God and lawless toward Him , but that I am [ especially keeping ] within and committed to the law of Christ , that I might win those who are without law .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak ( wanting in discernment ) I have become weak ( wanting in discernment ) that I might win the weak and overscrupulous . I have [ in short ] become all things to all men , that I might by all means ( at all costs and in any and every way ) save some [ by winning them to faith in Jesus Christ ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And I do this for the sake of the good news ( the Gospel ) , in order that I may become a participator in it and share in its [ blessings along with you ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete , but [ only ] one receives the prize ? So run [ your race ] that you may lay hold [ of the prize ] and make it yours .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	25	Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things . They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither , but we [ do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness ] that can not wither .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I do not run uncertainly ( without definite aim ) . I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversary .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But [ like a boxer ] I buffet my body [ handle it roughly , discipline it by hardships ] and subdue it , for fear that after proclaiming to others the Gospel and things pertaining to it , I myself should become unfit [ not stand the test , be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit ] .

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	5	Nevertheless , God was not pleased with the great majority of them , for they were overthrown and strewn down along [ the ground ] in the wilderness . ( D )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things are examples ( warnings and admonitions ) for us not to desire or crave or covet or lust after evil and carnal things as they did . ( E )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Do not be worshipers of false gods as some of them were , as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink [ the sacrifices offered to the golden calf at Horeb ] and rose to sport ( to dance and give way to jesting and hilarity ) . ( F )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	8	We must not gratify evil desire and indulge in immorality as some of them did—and twenty-three thousand [ suddenly ] fell dead in a single day ! ( G )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	9	We should not tempt the Lord [ try His patience , become a trial to Him , critically appraise Him , and exploit His goodness ] as some of them did—and were killed by poisonous serpents ; ( H )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now these things befell them by way of a figure [ as an example and warning to us ] ; they were written to admonish and fit us for right action by good instruction , we in whose days the ages have reached their climax ( their consummation and concluding period ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands [ who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm ] , take heed lest he fall [ into sin ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	13	For no temptation ( no trial regarded as enticing to sin ) , [ no matter how it comes or where it leads ] has overtaken you and laid hold on you that is not common to man [ that is , no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and that is not [ b ] adjusted and [ c ] adapted and belonging to human experience , and such as man can bear ] . But God is faithful [ to His Word and to His compassionate nature ] , and He [ can be trusted ] not to let you be tempted and tried and assayed beyond your ability and strength of resistance and power to endure , but with the temptation He will [ always ] also provide the way out ( the means of escape to [ d ] a landing place ) , that you may be capable and strong and powerful to bear up under it patiently .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my dearly beloved , shun ( keep clear away from , avoid by flight if need be ) any sort of idolatry ( of loving or venerating anything more than God ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I am speaking as to intelligent ( sensible ) men . Think over and make up your minds [ for yourselves ] about what I say . [ I appeal to your reason and your discernment in these matters . ]
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing [ of wine at the Lord ’ s Supper ] upon which we ask [ God ’ s ] blessing , does it not mean [ that in drinking it ] we participate in and share a fellowship ( a communion ) in the blood of Christ ( the Messiah ) ? The bread which we break , does it not mean [ that in eating it ] we participate in and share a fellowship ( a communion ) in the body of Christ ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For we [ no matter how ] numerous we are , are one body , because we all partake of the one Bread [ the One Whom the communion bread represents ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Consider those [ physically ] people of Israel . Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners of the altar [ united in their worship of the same God ] ? ( J )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What do I imply then ? That food offered to idols is [ intrinsically changed by the fact and amounts to ] anything or that an idol itself is a [ living ] thing ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , I am suggesting that what the pagans sacrifice they offer [ in effect ] to demons ( to evil spiritual powers ) and not to God [ at all ] . I do not want you to fellowship and be partners with diabolical spirits [ by eating at their feasts ] . ( K )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink the Lord ’ s cup and the demons ’ cup . You can not partake of the Lord ’ s table and the demons ’ table .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Shall we thus provoke the Lord to jealousy and anger and indignation ? Are we stronger than He [ that we should defy Him ] ? ( L )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are legitimate [ permissible—and we are free to do anything we please ] , but not all things are helpful ( expedient , profitable , and wholesome ) . All things are legitimate , but not all things are constructive [ to character ] and edifying [ to spiritual life ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no one then seek his own good and advantage and profit , but [ rather ] each one of the other [ let him seek the welfare of his neighbor ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	25	[ As to meat offered to idols ] eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question or investigating on the grounds of conscientious scruples ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	26	For the [ whole ] earth is the Lord ’ s and everything that is in it . ( M )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	27	In case one of the unbelievers invites you to a meal and you want to go , eat whatever is served to you without examining into its source because of conscientious scruples .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone tells you , This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol , do not eat it , out of consideration for the person who informed you , and for conscience ’ s sake—
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	29	I mean for the sake of his conscience , not yours , [ do not eat it ] . For why should another man ’ s scruples apply to me and my liberty of action be determined by his conscience ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I partake [ of my food ] with thankfulness , why am I accused and spoken evil of because of that for which I give thanks ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	31	So then , whether you eat or drink , or whatever you may do , do all for the honor and glory of God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Do not let yourselves be [ hindrances by giving ] an offense to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God [ [ e ] do not lead others into sin by your mode of life ] ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	10	33	Just as I myself strive to please [ to accommodate myself to the opinions , desires , and interests of others , adapting myself to ] all men in everything I do , not aiming at or considering my own profit and advantage , but that of the many in order that they may be saved .

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians 11:14 Joseph Thayer , A Greek-English Lexicon . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , in [ the plan of ] the Lord and from His point of view woman is not apart from and independent of man , nor is man aloof from and independent of woman ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	2	I appreciate and commend you because you always remember me in everything and keep firm possession of the traditions ( the substance of my instructions ) , just as I have [ verbally ] passed them on to you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to know and realize that Christ is the Head of every man , the head of a woman is her husband , and the Head of Christ is God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Any man who prays or prophesies ( teaches , refutes , reproves , admonishes , and comforts ) with his head covered dishonors his Head ( Christ ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	5	And any woman who [ publicly ] prays or prophesies ( teaches , refutes , reproves , admonishes , or comforts ) when she is bareheaded dishonors her head ( her husband ) ; it is the same as [ if her head were ] shaved .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman will not wear [ a head ] covering , then she should cut off her hair too ; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaven , let her cover [ her head ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man ought not to wear anything on his head [ in church ] , for he is the image and [ reflected ] glory of God [ [ a ] his function of government reflects the majesty of the divine Rule ] ; but woman is [ the expression of ] man ’ s glory ( majesty , preeminence ) . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For man was not [ created ] from woman , but woman from man ; ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Neither was man created on account of or for the benefit of woman , but woman on account of and for the benefit of man . ( C )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	10	[ b ] Therefore she should [ be subject to his authority and should ] have a covering on her head [ as a token , a symbol , of her submission to authority , [ c ] that she may show reverence as do ] the angels [ and not displease them ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as woman was made from man , even so man is also born of woman ; and all [ whether male or female go forth ] from God [ as their Author ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Consider for yourselves ; is it proper and decent [ according to your customs ] for a woman to offer prayer to God [ publicly ] with her head uncovered ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Does not [ d ] the native sense of propriety ( experience , common sense , reason ) itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is a dishonor [ humiliating and degrading ] to him ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman has long hair , it is her ornament and glory ? For her hair is given to her for a covering .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	16	Now if anyone is disposed to be argumentative and contentious about this , we hold to and recognize no other custom [ in worship ] than this , nor do the churches of God generally .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But in what I instruct [ you ] next I do not commend [ you ] , because when you meet together , it is not for the better but for the worse .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For in the first place , when you assemble as a congregation , I hear that there are cliques ( divisions and factions ) among you ; and I in part believe it ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For doubtless there have to be factions or parties among you in order that they who are genuine and of approved fitness may become evident and plainly recognized among you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	20	So when you gather for your meetings , it is not the supper instituted by the Lord that you eat ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For in eating each one [ hurries ] to get his own supper first [ not waiting for the poor ] , and one goes hungry while another gets drunk .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ! Do you have no houses in which to eat and drink ? Or do you despise the church of God and mean to show contempt for it , while you humiliate those who are poor ( have no homes and have brought no food ) ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I commend you in this ? No , [ most certainly ] I will not !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord Himself that which I passed on to you [ it was given to me personally ] , that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was treacherously delivered up and while His betrayal was in progress took bread ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	24	And when He had given thanks , He broke [ it ] and said , Take , eat . This is My body , which is broken for you . Do this to call Me [ affectionately ] to remembrance .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	25	Similarly when supper was ended , He took the cup also , saying , This cup is the new covenant [ ratified and established ] in My blood . Do this , as often as you drink [ it ] , to call Me [ affectionately ] to remembrance .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you are representing and signifying and proclaiming the fact of the Lord ’ s death until He comes [ again ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [ of Him ] will be guilty of [ profaning and sinning against ] the body and blood of the Lord .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	28	Let a man [ thoroughly ] examine himself , and [ only when he has done ] so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that [ it is Christ ’ s ] body , eats and drinks a sentence ( a verdict of judgment ) upon himself .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That [ careless and unworthy participation ] is the reason many of you are weak and sickly , and quite enough of you have fallen into the sleep of death .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	31	For if we searchingly examined ourselves [ detecting our shortcomings and recognizing our own condition ] , we should not be judged and penalty decreed [ by the divine judgment ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we [ fall short and ] are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined and chastened , so that we may not [ finally ] be condemned [ to eternal punishment along ] with the world .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers , when you gather together to eat [ the Lord ’ s Supper ] , wait for one another .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest you come together to bring judgment [ on yourselves ] . About the other matters , I will give you directions [ personally ] when I come . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:28 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For just as the body is a unity and yet has many parts , and all the parts , though many , form [ only ] one body , so it is with Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathen , you were led off after idols that could not speak [ habitually ] as impulse directed and whenever the occasion might arise .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking under the power and influence of the [ Holy ] Spirit of God can [ ever ] say , Jesus be cursed ! And no one can [ really ] say , Jesus is [ my ] Lord , except by and under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are distinctive varieties and distributions of endowments ( gifts , [ a ] extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians , due to the power of divine grace operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit ) and they vary , but the [ Holy ] Spirit remains the same .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are distinctive varieties of service and ministration , but it is the same Lord [ Who is served ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are distinctive varieties of operation [ of working to accomplish things ] , but it is the same God Who inspires and energizes them all in all .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ the evidence , the spiritual illumination of the Spirit ] for good and profit .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	8	To one is given in and through the [ Holy ] Spirit [ the power to speak ] a message of wisdom , and to another [ the power to express ] a word of knowledge and understanding according to the same [ Holy ] Spirit ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	9	To another [ [ b ] wonder-working ] faith by the same [ Holy ] Spirit , to another the extraordinary powers of healing by the one Spirit ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles , to another prophetic insight ( [ c ] the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose ) ; to another the ability to discern and distinguish between [ the utterances of true ] spirits [ and false ones ] , to another various kinds of [ unknown ] tongues , to another the ability to interpret [ such ] tongues .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	11	All these [ gifts , achievements , abilities ] are inspired and brought to pass by one and the same [ Holy ] Spirit , Who apportions to each person individually [ exactly ] as He chooses .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For by [ [ d ] means of the personal agency of ] one [ Holy ] Spirit we were all , whether Jews or Greeks , slaves or free , baptized [ and [ e ] by baptism united together ] into one body , and all made to drink of one [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body does not consist of one limb or organ but of many .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say , Because I am not the hand , I do not belong to the body , would it be therefore not [ a part ] of the body ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	16	If the ear should say , Because I am not the eye , I do not belong to the body , would it be therefore not [ a part ] of the body ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where [ would be the sense of ] hearing ? If the whole body were an ear , where [ would be the sense of ] smell ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But as it is , God has placed and arranged the limbs and organs in the body , each [ particular one ] of them , just as He wished and saw fit and with the best adaptation .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	19	But if [ the whole ] were all a single organ , where would the body be ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	20	And now there are [ certainly ] many limbs and organs , but a single body .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye is not able to say to the hand , I have no need of you , nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	22	But instead , there is [ absolute ] necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And those [ parts ] of the body which we consider rather ignoble are [ the very parts ] which we invest with additional honor , and our unseemly parts and those unsuitable for exposure are treated with seemliness ( modesty and decorum ) ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	24	Which our more presentable parts do not require . But God has so adjusted ( mingled , harmonized , and subtly proportioned the parts of ) the whole body , giving the greater honor and richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack [ apparent importance ] ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	25	So that there should be no division or discord or lack of adaptation [ of the parts of the body to each other ] , but the members all alike should have a mutual interest in and care for one another .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffers , all the parts [ share ] the suffering ; if one member is honored , all the members [ share in ] the enjoyment of it .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you [ collectively ] are Christ ’ s body and [ individually ] you are members of it , each part severally and distinct [ each with his own place and function ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	28	So God has appointed some in the church [ [ f ] for His own use ] : first apostles ( special messengers ) ; second prophets ( inspired preachers and expounders ) ; third teachers ; then wonder-workers ; then those with ability to heal the sick ; helpers ; administrators ; [ speakers in ] different ( unknown ) tongues .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ( special messengers ) ? Are all prophets ( inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God ) ? Are all teachers ? Do all have the power of performing miracles ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Do all possess extraordinary powers of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts and graces ( the higher gifts and the choicest graces ) . And yet I will show you a still more excellent way [ one that is better by far and the highest of them all—love ] . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians 13:12 Matthew Henry , Commentary on the Holy Bible . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And so faith , hope , love abide [ faith—conviction and belief respecting man ’ s relation to God and divine things ; hope—joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation ; love—true affection for God and man , growing out of God ’ s love for and in us ] , these three ; but the greatest of these is love . Footnotes -
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I have prophetic powers ( [ b ] the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose ) , and understand all the secret truths and mysteries and possess all knowledge , and if I have [ sufficient ] faith so that I can remove mountains , but have not love ( God ’ s love in me ) I am nothing ( a useless nobody ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	3	Even if I dole out all that I have [ to the poor in providing ] food , and if I surrender my body to be burned or [ c ] in order that I may glory , but have not love ( God ’ s love in me ) , I gain nothing .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love endures long and is patient and kind ; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy , is not boastful or vainglorious , does not display itself haughtily .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	5	It is not conceited ( arrogant and inflated with pride ) ; it is not rude ( unmannerly ) and does not act unbecomingly . Love ( God ’ s love in us ) does not insist on its own rights or its own way , for it is not self-seeking ; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful ; it takes no account of the evil done to it [ it pays no attention to a suffered wrong ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	6	It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness , but rejoices when right and truth prevail .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Love bears up under anything and everything that comes , is ever ready to believe the best of every person , its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances , and it endures everything [ without weakening ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never fails [ never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end ] . As for prophecy ( [ d ] the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose ) , it will be fulfilled and pass away ; as for tongues , they will be destroyed and cease ; as for knowledge , it will pass away [ it will lose its value and be superseded by truth ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For our knowledge is fragmentary ( incomplete and imperfect ) , and our prophecy ( our teaching ) is fragmentary ( incomplete and imperfect ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when the complete and perfect ( total ) comes , the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away ( become antiquated , void , and superseded ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child ; now that I have become a man , I am done with childish ways and have put them aside .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim ( blurred ) reflection [ of reality as [ e ] in a riddle or enigma ] , but then [ when perfection comes ] we shall see in reality and face to face ! Now I know in part ( imperfectly ) , but then I shall know and understand [ f ] fully and clearly , even in the same manner as I have been [ g ] fully and clearly known and understood [ [ h ] by God ] .

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:38 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . Some manuscripts read : “ he is not known. ” Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in an [ unknown ] tongue , my spirit [ by the [ d ] Holy Spirit within me ] prays , but my mind is unproductive [ it bears no fruit and helps nobody ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For one who speaks in an [ unknown ] tongue speaks not to men but to God , for no one understands or catches his meaning , because in the [ Holy ] Spirit he utters secret truths and hidden things [ not obvious to the understanding ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But [ on the other hand ] , the one who prophesies [ who [ b ] interprets the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching ] speaks to men for their upbuilding and constructive spiritual progress and encouragement and consolation .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He who speaks in a [ strange ] tongue edifies and improves himself , but he who prophesies [ [ c ] interpreting the divine will and purpose and teaching with inspiration ] edifies and improves the church and promotes growth [ in Christian wisdom , piety , holiness , and happiness ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I wish that you might all speak in [ unknown ] tongues , but more especially [ I want you ] to prophesy ( to be inspired to preach and interpret the divine will and purpose ) . He who prophesies [ who is inspired to preach and teach ] is greater ( more useful and more important ) than he who speaks in [ unknown ] tongues , unless he should interpret [ what he says ] , so that the church may be edified and receive good [ from it ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Now , brethren , if I come to you speaking in [ unknown ] tongues , how shall I make it to your advantage unless I speak to you either in revelation ( disclosure of God ’ s will to man ) in knowledge or in prophecy or in instruction ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	7	If even inanimate musical instruments , such as the flute or the harp , do not give distinct notes , how will anyone [ listening ] know or understand what is played ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And if the war bugle gives an uncertain ( indistinct ) call , who will prepare for battle ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	9	Just so it is with you ; if you in the [ unknown ] tongue speak words that are not intelligible , how will anyone understand what you are saying ? For you will be talking into empty space !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , I suppose , all these many [ to us unknown ] tongues in the world [ somewhere ] , and none is destitute of [ its own power of ] expression and meaning .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	11	But if I do not know the force and significance of the speech ( language ) , I shall seem to be a foreigner to the one who speaks [ to me ] , and the speaker who addresses [ me ] will seem a foreigner to me .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So it is with yourselves ; since you are so eager and ambitious to possess spiritual endowments and manifestations of the [ Holy ] Spirit , [ concentrate on ] striving to excel and to abound [ in them ] in ways that will build up the church .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore , the person who speaks in an [ unknown ] tongue should pray [ for the power ] to interpret and explain what he says .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	15	Then what am I to do ? I will pray with my spirit [ by the [ e ] Holy Spirit that is within me ] , but I will also pray [ intelligently ] with my mind and understanding ; I will sing with my spirit [ by the Holy Spirit that is within me ] , but I will sing [ intelligently ] with my mind and understanding also .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise , if you bless and render thanks with [ your ] spirit [ [ f ] thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit ] , how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [ interpreting of unknown ] tongues , say the Amen to your thanksgiving , since he does not know what you are saying ? ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	17	To be sure , you may give thanks well ( nobly ) , but the bystander is not edified [ it does him no good ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank God that I speak in [ strange ] tongues ( languages ) more than any of you or all of you put together ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	19	Nevertheless , in public worship , I would rather say five words with my understanding and intelligently in order to instruct others , than ten thousand words in a [ strange ] tongue ( language ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , do not be children [ immature ] in your thinking ; continue to be babes in [ matters of ] evil , but in your minds be mature [ men ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	21	It is written in the Law , By men of strange languages and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people , and not even then will they listen to Me , says the Lord . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Thus [ unknown ] tongues are meant for a [ supernatural ] sign , not for believers but for unbelievers [ on the point of believing ] , while prophecy ( inspired preaching and teaching , interpreting the divine will and purpose ) is not for unbelievers [ on the point of believing ] but for believers .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore , if the whole church assembles and all of you speak in [ unknown ] tongues , and the ungifted and uninitiated or unbelievers come in , will they not say that you are demented ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy [ giving inspired testimony and interpreting the divine will and purpose ] and an unbeliever or untaught outsider comes in , he is told of his sin and reproved and convicted and convinced by all , and his defects and needs are examined ( estimated , determined ) and he is called to account by all ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of his heart are laid bare ; and so , falling on [ his ] face , he will worship God , declaring that God is among you in very truth .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	26	What then , brethren , is [ the right course ] ? When you meet together , each one has a hymn , a teaching , a disclosure of special knowledge or information , an utterance in a [ strange ] tongue , or an interpretation of it . [ But ] let everything be constructive and edifying and for the good of all .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If some speak in a [ strange ] tongue , let the number be limited to two or at the most three , and each one [ taking his ] turn , and let one interpret and explain [ what is said ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no one to do the interpreting , let each of them keep still in church and talk to himself and to God .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	29	So let two or three prophets speak [ those inspired to preach or teach ] , while the rest pay attention and weigh and discern what is said .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if an inspired revelation comes to another who is sitting by , then let the first one be silent .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For in this way you can give testimony [ prophesying and thus interpreting the divine will and purpose ] one by one , so that all may be instructed and all may be stimulated and encouraged ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	32	For the spirits of the prophets ( the speakers in tongues ) are under the speaker ’ s control [ and subject to being silenced as may be necessary ] ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For He [ Who is the source of their prophesying ] is not a God of confusion and disorder but of peace and order . As [ is the practice ] in all the churches of the saints ( God ’ s people ) ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	34	The women should keep quiet in the churches , for they are not authorized to speak , but should take a secondary and subordinate place , just as the Law also says . ( C )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	35	But if there is anything they want to learn , they should ask their own husbands at home , for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church [ [ g ] for her to usurp and exercise authority over men in the church ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	36	What ! Did the word of the Lord originate with you [ Corinthians ] , or has it reached only you ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks and claims that he is a prophet [ filled with and governed by the Holy Spirit of God and inspired to interpret the divine will and purpose in preaching or teaching ] or has any other spiritual endowment , let him understand ( recognize and acknowledge ) that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if anyone disregards or does not recognize [ [ h ] that it is a command of the Lord ] , he is disregarded and not recognized [ he is [ i ] one whom God knows not ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So [ to conclude ] , my brethren , earnestly desire and set your hearts on prophesying ( on being inspired to preach and teach and to interpret God ’ s will and purpose ) , and do not forbid or hinder speaking in [ unknown ] tongues .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But all things should be done with regard to decency and propriety and in an orderly fashion . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:56 Joseph Thayer , A Greek-English Lexicon . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	15	We are even discovered to be misrepresenting God , for we testified of Him that He raised Christ , Whom He did not raise in case it is true that the dead are not raised .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	2	And by which you are saved , if you hold fast and keep firmly what I preached to you , unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I passed on to you first of all what I also had received , that Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) died for our sins in accordance with [ what ] the Scriptures [ foretold ] , ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	4	That He was buried , that He arose on the third day as the Scriptures foretold , ( B )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	5	And [ also ] that He appeared to Cephas ( Peter ) , then to the Twelve .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	6	Then later He showed Himself to more than five hundred brethren at one time , the majority of whom are still alive , but some have fallen asleep [ in death ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Afterward He was seen by James , then by all the apostles ( the special messengers ) ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all He appeared to me also , as to one prematurely and born dead [ [ a ] no better than an unperfected fetus among living men ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least [ worthy ] of the apostles , who am not fit or deserving to be called an apostle , because I once wronged and pursued and molested the church of God [ oppressing it with cruelty and violence ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing ) of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me was not [ found to be ] for nothing ( fruitless and without effect ) . In fact , I worked harder than all of them [ the apostles ] , though it was not really I , but the grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing ) of God which was with me .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So , whether then it was I or they , this is what we preach and this is what you believed [ what you adhered to , trusted in , and relied on ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	12	But now if Christ ( the Messiah ) is preached as raised from the dead , how is it that some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then Christ has not risen ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not risen , then our preaching is in vain [ it amounts to nothing ] and your faith is devoid of truth and is fruitless ( without effect , empty , imaginary , and unfounded ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised , your faith is mere delusion [ futile , fruitless ] , and you are still in your sins [ under the control and penalty of sin ] ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	18	And further , those who have died in [ [ b ] spiritual fellowship and union with ] Christ have perished ( are lost ) !
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we who are [ abiding ] in Christ have hope only in this life and that is all , then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But the fact is that Christ ( the Messiah ) has been raised from the dead , and He became the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep [ in death ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since [ it was ] through a man that death [ came into the world , it is ] also through a Man that the resurrection of the dead [ has come ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For just as [ because of their [ c ] union of nature ] in Adam all people die , so also [ by virtue of their [ d ] union of nature ] shall all in Christ be made alive .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own rank and turn : Christ ( the Messiah ) [ is ] the firstfruits , then those who are Christ ’ s [ own will be resurrected ] at His coming .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	24	After that comes the end ( the completion ) , when He delivers over the kingdom to God the Father after rendering inoperative and abolishing every [ other ] rule and every authority and power .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For [ Christ ] must be King and reign until He has put all [ His ] enemies under His feet . ( C )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be subdued and abolished is death .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For He [ the Father ] has put all things in subjection under His [ Christ ’ s ] feet . But when it says , All things are put in subjection [ under Him ] , it is evident that He [ Himself ] is excepted Who does the subjecting of all things to Him . ( D )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	28	However , when everything is subjected to Him , then the Son Himself will also subject Himself to [ the Father ] Who put all things under Him , so that God may be all in all [ be everything to everyone , supreme , the indwelling and controlling factor of life ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what do people mean by being [ themselves ] baptized in behalf of the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people baptized for them ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	30	[ For that matter ] , why do I live [ dangerously as I do , running such risks that I am ] in peril every hour ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	31	[ I assure you ] by the pride which I have in you in [ your [ e ] fellowship and union with ] Christ Jesus our Lord , that I die daily [ I face death every day and die to self ] .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	32	What do I gain if , merely from the human point of view , I fought with [ wild ] beasts at Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised [ at all ] , let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we will be dead . ( E )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be so deceived and misled ! Evil companionships ( communion , associations ) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake [ [ f ] from your drunken stupor and return ] to sober sense and your right minds , and sin no more . For some of you have not the knowledge of God [ you are utterly and willfully and disgracefully ignorant , and continue to be so , lacking the sense of God ’ s presence and all true knowledge of Him ] . I say this to your shame .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say , How can the dead be raised ? With what [ kind of ] body will they come forth ?
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	36	You foolish man ! Every time you plant seed , you sow something that does not come to life [ germinating , springing up , and growing ] unless it dies first .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	37	Nor is the seed you sow then the body which it is going to have [ later ] , but it is a naked kernel , perhaps of wheat or some of the rest of the grains .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives to it the body that He plans and sees fit , and to each kind of seed a body of its own . ( F )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	39	For all flesh is not the same , but there is one kind for humans , another for beasts , another for birds , and another for fish .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are heavenly bodies ( sun , moon , and stars ) and there are earthly bodies ( men , animals , and plants ) , but the beauty and glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind , while the beauty and glory of earthly bodies is a different kind .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun is glorious in one way , the moon is glorious in another way , and the stars are glorious in their own [ distinctive ] way ; for one star differs from and surpasses another in its beauty and brilliance .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So it is with the resurrection of the dead . [ The body ] that is sown is perishable and decays , but [ the body ] that is resurrected is imperishable ( immune to decay , immortal ) . ( G )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor and humiliation ; it is raised in honor and glory . It is sown in infirmity and weakness ; it is resurrected in strength and endued with power .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural ( physical ) body ; it is raised a supernatural ( a spiritual ) body . [ As surely as ] there is a physical body , there is also a spiritual body .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	45	Thus it is written , The first man Adam became a living being ( an individual personality ) ; the last Adam ( Christ ) became a life-giving Spirit [ restoring the dead to life ] . ( H )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But it is not the spiritual life which came first , but the physical and then the spiritual .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man [ was ] from out of earth , made of dust ( earthly-minded ) ; the second Man [ is ] the Lord from out of heaven . ( I )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	48	Now those who are made of the dust are like him who was first made of the dust ( earthly-minded ) ; and as is [ the Man ] from heaven , so also [ are those ] who are of heaven ( heavenly-minded ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And just as we have borne the image [ of the man ] of dust , so shall we and so [ g ] let us also bear the image [ of the Man ] of heaven .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	50	But I tell you this , brethren , flesh and blood can not [ become partakers of eternal salvation and ] inherit or share in the kingdom of God ; nor does the perishable ( that which is decaying ) inherit or share in the imperishable ( the immortal ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Take notice ! I tell you a mystery ( a secret truth , an event decreed by the hidden purpose or counsel of God ) . We shall not all fall asleep [ in death ] , but we shall all be changed ( transformed )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	52	In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the [ sound of the ] last trumpet call . For a trumpet will sound , and the dead [ in Christ ] will be raised imperishable ( free and immune from decay ) , and we shall be changed ( transformed ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this perishable [ part of us ] must put on the imperishable [ nature ] , and this mortal [ part of us , this nature that is capable of dying ] must put on immortality ( freedom from death ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	54	And when this perishable puts on the imperishable and this that was capable of dying puts on freedom from death , then shall be fulfilled the Scripture that says , Death is swallowed up ( utterly vanquished [ h ] forever ) in and unto victory . ( J )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	55	O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ( K )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Now sin is the sting of death , and sin exercises its power [ i ] [ upon the soul ] through [ j ] [ the abuse of ] the Law .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , Who gives us the victory [ making us conquerors ] through our Lord Jesus Christ .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be firm ( steadfast ) , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord [ always being superior , excelling , doing more than enough in the service of the Lord ] , knowing and being continually aware that your labor in the Lord is not futile [ it is never wasted or to no purpose ] .

AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	16	I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders and to enlist under them and be subject to them , as well as to everyone who joins and cooperates [ with you ] and labors earnestly .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On the first [ day ] of each week , let each one of you [ personally ] put aside something and save it up as he has prospered [ in proportion to what he is given ] , so that no collections will need to be taken after I come .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I arrive , I will send on those whom you approve and authorize with credentials to carry your gift [ of charity ] to Jerusalem .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	4	If it seems worthwhile that I should go too , they will accompany me .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	5	After passing through Macedonia , I will visit you , for I intend [ only ] to pass through Macedonia ;
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	6	But it may be that I will stay with you [ for a while ] , perhaps even spend the winter , so that you may bring me forward [ on my journey ] to wherever I may go .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I am unwilling to see you right now [ just ] in passing , but I hope later to remain for some time with you , if the Lord permits .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	8	I will remain in Ephesus [ however ] until Pentecost ,
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a wide door of opportunity for effectual [ service ] has opened to me [ there , a great and promising one ] , and [ there are ] many adversaries .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	10	When Timothy arrives , see to it that [ you put him at ease , so that ] he may be fearless among you , for he is [ devotedly ] doing the Lord ’ s work , just as I am .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	11	So [ see to it that ] no one despises him or treats him as if he were of no account or slights him . But send him off [ cordially , speed him on his way ] in peace , that he may come to me , for I am expecting him [ to come along ] with the other brethren .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	12	As for our brother Apollos , I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren , but it was not at all his will or [ a ] God ’ s will that he should go now . He will come when he has opportunity .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Be alert and on your guard ; stand firm in your faith ( [ b ] your conviction respecting man ’ s relationship to God and divine things , keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it ) . Act like men and be courageous ; grow in strength ! ( A )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let everything you do be done in love ( true love to God and man as inspired by God ’ s love for us ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Now , brethren , you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts and our firstfruits in Achaia ( most of Greece ) , and how they have consecrated and devoted themselves to the service of the saints ( God ’ s people ) .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come [ to me ] , for they have made up for your absence .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they gave me [ c ] respite from labor and rested me and refreshed my spirit as well as yours . Deeply appreciate and thoroughly know and fully recognize such men .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia send greetings and best wishes . Aquila and Prisca , together with the church [ that meets ] in their house , send you their hearty greetings in the Lord .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren wish to be remembered to you and wish you well . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	21	I , Paul , [ add this final ] greeting with my own hand .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If anyone does not love the Lord [ does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him ] , he shall be accursed ! Our Lord will come ! ( Maranatha ! )
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
AMPC	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love ( that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God ) be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Corinthians 1:24 Joseph Thayer , A Greek-English Lexicon . Copyright ©
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle ( a special messenger ) of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and Timothy [ our ] brother , to the church ( assembly ) of God which is at Corinth , and to all the saints ( the people of God ) throughout Achaia ( most of Greece ) :
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of sympathy ( pity and mercy ) and the God [ Who is the Source ] of every comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	4	Who comforts ( consoles and encourages ) us in every trouble ( calamity and affliction ) , so that we may also be able to comfort ( console and encourage ) those who are in any kind of trouble or distress , with the comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) with which we ourselves are comforted ( consoled and encouraged ) by God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For just as Christ ’ s [ [ a ] own ] sufferings fall to our lot [ b ] [ as they overflow upon His disciples , and we share and experience them ] abundantly , so through Christ comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) is also [ shared and experienced ] abundantly by us .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	6	But if we are troubled ( afflicted and distressed ) , it is for your comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) and [ for your ] salvation ; and if we are comforted ( consoled and encouraged ) , it is for your comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) , which works [ in you ] when you patiently endure the same evils ( misfortunes and calamities ) that we also suffer and undergo .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope for you [ our joyful and confident expectation of good for you ] is ever unwavering ( assured and unshaken ) ; for we know that just as you share and are partners in [ our ] sufferings and calamities , you also share and are partners in [ our ] comfort ( consolation and encouragement ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be uninformed , brethren , about the affliction and oppressing distress which befell us in [ the province of ] Asia , how we were so utterly and unbearably weighed down and crushed that we despaired even of life [ itself ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Indeed , we felt within ourselves that we had received the [ very ] sentence of death , but that was to keep us from trusting in and depending on ourselves instead of on God Who raises the dead .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	10	[ For it is He ] Who rescued and saved us from such a perilous death , and He will still rescue and save us ; in and on Him we have set our hope ( our joyful and confident expectation ) that He will again deliver us [ from danger and destruction and [ c ] draw us to Himself ] ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	11	While you also cooperate by your prayers for us [ helping and laboring together with us ] . Thus [ the lips of ] many persons [ turned toward God will eventually ] give thanks on our behalf for the grace ( the blessing of deliverance ) granted us at the request of the many who have prayed .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	12	It is a reason for pride and exultation to which our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [ generally ] and especially toward you , with devout and pure motives and godly sincerity , not in fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God ( the unmerited favor and [ d ] merciful kindness by which God , exerting His holy influence upon souls , turns them to Christ , and keeps , strengthens , and increases them in Christian virtues ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write you nothing else but simply what you can read and understand [ there is no double meaning to what we say ] , and I hope that you will become thoroughly acquainted [ with [ e ] divine things ] and know and understand [ them ] accurately and well to the end ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	14	[ Just ] as you have [ already ] partially known and understood and acknowledged us and recognized that you can [ honestly ] be proud of us , even as we [ can be proud ] of you on the day of our Lord Jesus .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	15	It was with assurance of this that I wanted and planned to visit you first [ of all ] , so that you might have a double favor and token of grace ( goodwill ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	16	[ I wanted ] to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and [ then ] to come again to you [ on my return trip ] from Macedonia and have you send me forward on my way to Judea .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Now because I changed my original plan , was I being unstable and capricious ? Or what I plan , do I plan according to the flesh [ like a worldly man ] , ready to say Yes , yes , [ when it may mean ] No , no ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	18	As surely as God is trustworthy and faithful and means what He says , our speech and message to you have not been Yes [ that might mean ] No .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , Who has been preached among you by us , by myself , Silvanus , and Timothy , was not Yes and No ; but in Him it is [ always the divine ] Yes .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For as many as are the promises of God , they all find their Yes [ answer ] in Him [ Christ ] . For this reason we also utter the Amen ( so be it ) to God through Him [ in His Person and by His agency ] to the glory of God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	21	But it is God Who confirms and makes us steadfast and establishes us [ in joint fellowship ] with you in Christ , and has consecrated and anointed us [ [ f ] enduing us with the gifts of the Holy Spirit ] ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	22	[ He has also appropriated and acknowledged us as His by ] putting His seal upon us and giving us His [ Holy ] Spirit in our hearts as the security deposit and guarantee [ of the fulfillment of His promise ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But I call upon God as my soul ’ s witness : it was to avoid hurting you that I refrained from coming to Corinth—
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we have dominion [ over you ] and lord it over your faith , but [ rather that we work with you as ] fellow laborers [ to promote ] your joy , for in [ your ] faith ( [ g ] in your strong and welcome conviction or belief that Jesus is the Messiah , through Whom we obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of God ) you stand firm .

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I cause you pain [ with merited rebuke ] , who is there to provide me enjoyment but the [ very ] one whom I have grieved and made sad ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote the same to you so that when I came , I might not be myself pained by those who are the [ very ] ones who ought to make me glad , for I trusted in you all and felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For I wrote you out of great sorrow and deep distress [ with mental torture and anxiety ] of heart , [ yes , and ] with many tears , not to cause you pain but in order to make you realize the overflowing love that I continue increasingly to have for you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if someone [ the one among you who committed incest ] has caused [ all this ] grief and pain , he has caused it not to me , but in some measure , not to put it too severely , [ he has distressed ] all of you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	6	For such a one this censure by the majority [ which he has received is ] sufficient [ punishment ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	7	So [ instead of further rebuke , now ] you should rather turn and [ graciously ] forgive and comfort and encourage [ him ] , to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow and despair .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	8	I therefore beg you to reinstate him in your affections and assure him of your love for him ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For this was my purpose in writing you , to test your attitude and see if you would stand the test , whether you are obedient and altogether agreeable [ to following my orders ] in everything .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	10	If you forgive anyone anything , I too forgive that one ; and what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , has been for your sakes in the presence [ and with the approval ] of Christ ( the Messiah ) ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	11	To keep Satan from getting the advantage over us ; for we are not ignorant of his wiles and intentions .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I arrived at Troas [ to preach ] the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ , a door of opportunity was opened for me in the Lord ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	13	Yet my spirit could not rest ( relax , get relief ) because I did not find my brother Titus there . So I took leave from them and departed for Macedonia .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [ as trophies of Christ ’ s victory ] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [ which exhales ] unto God , [ discernible alike ] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing :
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To the latter it is an aroma [ wafted ] from death to death [ a fatal odor , the smell of doom ] ; to the former it is an aroma from life to life [ a vital fragrance , living and fresh ] . And who is qualified ( fit and sufficient ) for these things ? [ Who is able for such a ministry ? We ? ]
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not , like so many , [ like hucksters making a trade of ] peddling God ’ s Word [ shortchanging and adulterating the divine message ] ; but like [ men ] of sincerity and the purest motive , as [ commissioned and sent ] by God , we speak [ His message ] in Christ ( the Messiah ) , in the [ very ] sight and presence of God .

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us , not written with ink but with [ the ] Spirit of [ the ] living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Such is the reliance and confidence that we have through Christ toward and with reference to God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are fit ( qualified and sufficient in ability ) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us , but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	6	[ It is He ] Who has qualified us [ making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient ] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [ of salvation through Christ ] , not [ ministers ] of the letter ( of legally written code ) but of the Spirit ; for the code [ of the Law ] kills , but the [ Holy ] Spirit makes alive . ( B )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	7	Now if the dispensation of death engraved in letters on stone [ the ministration of the Law ] , was inaugurated with such glory and splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its brilliance , [ a glory ] that was to fade and pass away , ( C )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	8	Why should not the dispensation of the Spirit [ this spiritual [ b ] ministry whose task it is to cause men to obtain and be governed by the Holy Spirit ] be attended with much greater and more splendid glory ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the service that condemns [ the ministration of doom ] had glory , how infinitely more abounding in splendor and glory must be the service that makes righteous [ the ministry that produces and fosters righteous living and right standing with God ] !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	10	Indeed , in view of this fact , what once had splendor [ [ c ] the glory of the Law in the face of Moses ] has come to have no splendor at all , because of the overwhelming glory that exceeds and excels it [ [ d ] the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which was but passing and fading away came with splendor , how much more must that which remains and is permanent abide in glory and splendor !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Since we have such [ glorious ] hope ( such joyful and confident expectation ) , we speak very freely and openly and fearlessly .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	13	Nor [ do we act ] like Moses , who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze upon the finish of the vanishing [ splendor which had been upon it ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	14	In fact , their minds were grown hard and calloused [ they had become dull and had lost the power of understanding ] ; for until this present day , when the Old Testament ( the old covenant ) is being read , that same veil still lies [ on their hearts ] , not being lifted [ to reveal ] that in Christ it is made void and done away .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Yes , down to this [ very ] day whenever Moses is read , a veil lies upon their minds and hearts .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But whenever a person turns [ in repentance ] to the Lord , the veil is stripped off and taken away .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty ( emancipation from bondage , freedom ) . ( D )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	3	18	And all of us , as with unveiled face , [ because we ] continued to behold [ in the Word of God ] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another ; [ for this comes ] from the Lord [ Who is ] the Spirit .

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	4	For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers ’ minds [ that they should not discern the truth ] , preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ ( the Messiah ) , Who is the Image and Likeness of God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But even if our Gospel ( the glad tidings ) also be hidden ( obscured and covered up with a veil that hinders the knowledge of God ) , it is hidden [ only ] to those who are perishing and obscured [ only ] to those who are spiritually dying and veiled [ only ] to those who are lost .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For what we preach is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves [ merely ] as your servants ( slaves ) for Jesus ’ sake .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God Who said , Let light shine out of darkness , has shone in our hearts so as [ to beam forth ] the Light for the illumination of the knowledge of the majesty and glory of God [ as it is manifest in the Person and is revealed ] in the face of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	7	However , we possess this precious treasure [ the divine Light of the Gospel ] in [ frail , human ] vessels of earth , that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are hedged in ( pressed ) on every side [ troubled and oppressed in every way ] , but not cramped or crushed ; we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out , but not driven to despair ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We are pursued ( persecuted and hard driven ) , but not deserted [ to stand alone ] ; we are struck down to the ground , but never struck out and destroyed ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	10	Always carrying about in the body the liability and exposure to the same putting to death that the Lord Jesus suffered , so that the [ [ a ] resurrection ] life of Jesus also may be shown forth by and in our bodies .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are constantly [ experiencing ] being handed over to death for Jesus ’ sake , that the [ [ b ] resurrection ] life of Jesus also may be evidenced through our flesh which is liable to death .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	12	Thus death is actively at work in us , but [ it is in order that [ c ] our ] life [ may be actively at work ] in you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	13	Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote , I have believed , and therefore have I spoken . We too believe , and therefore we speak , ( B )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	14	Assured that He Who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and bring us [ along ] with you into His presence .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all [ these ] things are [ taking place ] for your sake , so that the more grace ( divine favor and spiritual blessing ) extends to more and more people and multiplies through the many , the more thanksgiving may increase [ and redound ] to the glory of God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we do not become discouraged ( utterly spiritless , exhausted , and wearied out through fear ) . Though our outer man is [ progressively ] decaying and wasting away , yet our inner self is being [ progressively ] renewed day after day .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our light , momentary affliction ( this slight distress of the passing hour ) is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [ beyond all measure , excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations , a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease ! ] ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	4	18	Since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen ; for the things that are visible are temporal ( brief and fleeting ) , but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	2	Corinthians 5:21 Henry Alford , The Greek New Testament , with Notes . Copyright ©
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now He Who has fashioned us [ preparing and making us fit ] for this very thing is God , Who also has given us the [ Holy ] Spirit as a guarantee [ of the fulfillment of His promise ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	3	So that by putting it on we may not be found naked ( without a body ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For while we are still in this tent , we groan under the burden and sigh deeply ( weighed down , depressed , oppressed ) —not that we want to put off the body ( the clothing of the spirit ) , but rather that we would be further clothed , so that what is mortal ( our dying body ) may be swallowed up by life [ [ a ] after the resurrection ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So then , we are always full of good and hopeful and confident courage ; we know that while we are at home in the body , we are abroad from the home with the Lord [ that is promised us ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	7	For we walk by faith [ we [ b ] regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man ’ s relationship to God and divine things , with trust and holy fervor ; thus we walk ] not by sight or appearance .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	8	[ Yes ] we have confident and hopeful courage and are pleased rather to be away from home out of the body and be at home with the Lord .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore , whether we are at home [ on earth away from Him ] or away from home [ and with Him ] , we are constantly ambitious and strive earnestly to be pleasing to Him .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear and be revealed as we are before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive [ his pay ] according to what he has done in the body , whether good or evil [ considering [ c ] what his purpose and motive have been , and what he has [ d ] achieved , been busy with , and given himself and his attention to accomplishing ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Therefore , being conscious of fearing the Lord with respect and reverence , we seek to win people over [ to persuade them ] . But [ e ] what sort of persons we are is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood by God , and I hope that it is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood also by your consciences ( your inborn discernment ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not commending ourselves to you again , but we are providing you with an occasion and incentive to be [ rightfully ] proud of us , so that you may have a reply for those who pride themselves on surface appearances [ [ f ] on the virtues they only appear to have ] , although their heart is devoid of them .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For if we are beside ourselves [ mad , as some say ] , it is for God and concerns Him ; if we are in our right mind , it is for your benefit ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ controls and urges and impels us , because we are of the opinion and conviction that [ if ] One died for all , then all died ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And He died for all , so that all those who live might live no longer to and for themselves , but to and for Him Who died and was raised again for their sake .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Consequently , from now on we estimate and regard no one from a [ purely ] human point of view [ in terms of natural standards of value ] . [ No ] even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man , yet now [ we have such knowledge of Him that ] we know Him no longer [ in terms of the flesh ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if any person is [ ingrafted ] in Christ ( the Messiah ) he is a new creation ( a new creature altogether ) ; the old [ previous moral and spiritual condition ] has passed away . Behold , the fresh and new has come !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	18	But all things are from God , Who through Jesus Christ reconciled us to Himself [ received us into favor , brought us into harmony with Himself ] and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation [ that by word and deed we might aim to bring others into harmony with Him ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	19	It was God [ personally present ] in Christ , reconciling and restoring the world to favor with Himself , not counting up and holding against [ men ] their trespasses [ but cancelling them ] , and committing to us the message of reconciliation ( of the restoration to favor ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we are Christ ’ s ambassadors , God making His appeal as it were through us . We [ as Christ ’ s personal representatives ] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [ now offered you ] and be reconciled to God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	5	21	For our sake He made Christ [ virtually ] to be sin Who knew no sin , so that in and through Him we might become [ [ g ] endued with , viewed as being in , and examples of ] the righteousness of God [ what we ought to be , approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him , by His goodness ] .

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	6	By innocence and purity , knowledge and spiritual insight , longsuffering and patience , kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in unfeigned love ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We put no obstruction in anybody ’ s way [ we give no offense in anything ] , so that no fault may be found and [ our ] ministry blamed and discredited .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But we commend ourselves in every way as [ true ] servants of God : through great endurance , in tribulation and suffering , in hardships and privations , in sore straits and calamities ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	5	In beatings , imprisonments , riots , labors , sleepless watching , hunger ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	7	By [ speaking ] the word of truth , in the power of God , with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [ to attack ] and for the left hand [ to defend ] ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	8	Amid honor and dishonor ; in defaming and evil report and in praise and good report . [ We are branded ] as deceivers ( impostors ) , and [ yet vindicated as ] truthful and honest .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	9	[ We are treated ] as unknown and ignored [ by the world ] , and [ yet we are ] well-known and recognized [ by God and His people ] ; as dying , and yet here we are alive ; as chastened by suffering and [ yet ] not killed ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	10	As grieved and mourning , yet [ we are ] always rejoicing ; as poor [ ourselves , yet ] bestowing riches on many ; as having nothing , and [ yet in reality ] possessing all things .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you , Corinthians [ we are hiding nothing , keeping nothing back ] , and our heart is expanded wide [ for you ] ! ( B )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	12	There is no lack of room for you in [ our hearts ] , but you lack room in your own affections [ for us ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	13	By way of return then , do this for me—I speak as to children—open wide your hearts also [ to us ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers [ do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them , inconsistent with your faith ] . For what partnership have right living and right standing with God with iniquity and lawlessness ? Or how can light have fellowship with darkness ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	15	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial [ the devil ] ? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What agreement [ can there be between ] a temple of God and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ; even as God said , I will dwell in and with and among them and will walk in and with and among them , and I will be their God , and they shall be My people . ( C )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	17	So , come out from among [ unbelievers ] , and separate ( sever ) yourselves from them , says the Lord , and touch not [ any ] unclean thing ; then I will receive you kindly and treat you with favor , ( D )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	6	18	And I will be a Father to you , and you shall be My sons and daughters , says the Lord Almighty . ( E ) Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	7	[ Yes ] and not only by his coming but also by [ his account of ] the comfort with which he was encouraged and refreshed and cheered as to you , while he told us of your yearning affection , of how sorry you were [ for me ] and how eagerly you took my part , so that I rejoiced still more .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to reproach or condemn [ you ] , for I have said before that you are [ nested ] in our hearts , [ and you will remain there ] together [ with us ] , whether we die or live .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I have great boldness and free and fearless confidence and cheerful courage toward you ; my pride in you is great . I am filled [ brimful ] with the comfort [ of it ] ; with all our tribulation and in spite of it , [ I am filled with comfort ] I am overflowing with joy .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even when we arrived in Macedonia , our bodies had no ease or rest , but we were oppressed in every way and afflicted at every turn—fighting and contentions without , dread and fears within [ us ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , Who comforts and encourages and refreshes and cheers the depressed and the sinking , comforted and encouraged and refreshed and cheered us by the arrival of Titus .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For even though I did grieve you with my letter , I do not regret [ it now ] , though I did regret it ; for I see that that letter did pain you , though only for a little while ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Yet I am glad now , not because you were pained , but because you were pained into repentance [ and so turned back to God ] ; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel , so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us or harm for what we did .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For godly grief and the pain God is permitted to direct , produce a repentance that leads and contributes to salvation and deliverance from evil , and it never brings regret ; but worldly grief ( the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world ) is deadly [ breeding and ending in death ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For [ you can look back now and ] observe what this same godly sorrow has done for you and has produced in you : what eagerness and earnest care to explain and clear yourselves [ of all [ a ] complicity in the condoning of incest ] , what indignation [ at the sin ] , what alarm , what yearning , what zeal [ to do justice to all concerned ] , what readiness to mete out punishment [ [ b ] to the offender ] ! At every point you have proved yourselves cleared and guiltless in the matter . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So although I did write to you [ as I did ] , it was not for the sake and because of the one who did [ the ] wrong , nor on account of the one who suffered [ the ] wrong , but in order that you might realize before God [ that your readiness to accept our authority revealed ] how zealously you do care for us .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we are relieved and comforted and encouraged [ at the result ] . And in addition to our own [ personal ] consolation , we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus , because you have all set his mind at rest , soothing and refreshing his spirit .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I had boasted to him at all concerning you , I was not disappointed or put to shame , but just as everything we ever said to you was true , so our boasting [ about you ] to Titus has proved true also .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his heart goes out to you more abundantly than ever as he recalls the submission [ to his guidance ] that all of you had , and the reverence and anxiety [ to meet all requirements ] with which you accepted and welcomed him .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I am very happy because I now am of good courage and have perfect confidence in you in all things . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I give this not as an order [ to dictate to you ] , but to prove , by [ pointing out ] the zeal of others , the sincerity of your [ own ] love also .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For , as I can bear witness , [ they gave ] according to their ability , yes , and beyond their ability ; and [ they did it ] voluntarily ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	4	Begging us most insistently for the favor and the fellowship of contributing in this ministration for [ the relief and support of ] the saints [ in Jerusalem ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	5	Nor [ was this gift of theirs merely the contribution ] that we expected , but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [ as His agents ] by the will of God [ [ a ] entirely disregarding their personal interests , they gave as much as they possibly could , having put themselves at our disposal to be directed by the will of God ] —
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So much so that we have urged Titus that as he began it , he should also complete this beneficent and gracious contribution among you [ the church at Corinth ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Now as you abound and excel and are at the front in everything—in faith , in expressing yourselves , in knowledge , in all zeal , and in your love for us— [ see to it that you come to the front now and ] abound and excel in this gracious work [ of almsgiving ] also .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you are becoming progressively acquainted with and recognizing more strongly and clearly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ ( His kindness , His gracious generosity , His undeserved favor and spiritual blessing ) , [ in ] that though He was [ so very ] rich , yet for your sakes He became [ so very ] poor , in order that by His poverty you might become enriched ( abundantly supplied ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	10	[ It is then ] my counsel and my opinion in this matter that I give [ you when I say ] : It is profitable and fitting for you [ now to complete the enterprise ] which more than a year ago you not only began , but were the first to wish to do anything [ about contributions for the relief of the saints at Jerusalem ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now finish doing it , that your [ enthusiastic ] readiness in desiring it may be equalled by your completion of it according to your ability and means .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the [ eager ] readiness to give is there , then it is acceptable and welcomed in proportion to what a person has , not according to what he does not have .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For it is not [ intended ] that other people be eased and relieved [ of their responsibility ] and you be burdened and suffer [ unfairly ] ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	14	But to have equality [ share and share alike ] , your surplus over necessity at the present time going to meet their want and to equalize the difference created by it , so that [ at some other time ] their surplus in turn may be given to supply your want . Thus there may be equality ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written , He who gathered much had nothing over , and he who gathered little did not lack . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God Who planted the same earnest zeal and care for you in the heart of Titus .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For he not only welcomed and responded to our appeal , but was himself so keen in his enthusiasm and interest in you that he is going to you of his own accord .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	18	But we are sending along with him that brother [ Luke ? ] whose praise in the Gospel ministry [ is spread ] throughout all the churches ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And more than that , he has been appointed by the churches to travel as our companion in regard to this bountiful contribution which we are administering for the glory of the Lord Himself and [ to show ] our eager readiness [ as Christians to help one another ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	20	[ For ] we are on our guard , intending that no one should find anything for which to blame us in regard to our administration of this large contribution .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	21	For we take thought beforehand and aim to be honest and absolutely above suspicion , not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	22	Moreover , along with them we are sending our brother , whom we have often put to the test and have found him zealous ( devoted and earnest ) in many matters , but who is now more [ eagerly ] earnest than ever because of [ his ] absolute confidence in you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	23	As for Titus , he is my colleague and shares my work in your service ; and as for the [ other two ] brethren , they are the [ special ] messengers of the churches , a credit and glory to Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Show to these men , therefore , in the sight of the churches , the reality and plain truth of your love ( your affection , goodwill , and benevolence ) and what [ good reasons ] I had for boasting about and being proud of you . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written , He [ the benevolent person ] scatters abroad ; He gives to the poor ; His deeds of justice and goodness and kindness and benevolence will go on and endure forever ! ( B )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Still , I am sending the brethren [ on to you ] , lest our pride in you should be made an empty boast in this particular case , and so that you may be all ready , as I told them you would be ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Lest , if [ any ] Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared [ for this generosity ] , we , to say nothing of yourselves , be humiliated for our being so confident .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	5	That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brethren to go to you before I do and make arrangements in advance for this bountiful , promised gift of yours , so that it may be ready , not as an extortion [ wrung out of you ] but as a generous and willing gift .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	6	[ Remember ] this : he who sows sparingly and grudgingly will also reap sparingly and grudgingly , and he who sows generously [ [ a ] that blessings may come to someone ] will also reap generously and with blessings .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Let each one [ give ] as he has made up his own mind and purposed in his heart , not reluctantly or sorrowfully or under compulsion , for God loves ( He [ b ] takes pleasure in , prizes above other things , and is unwilling to abandon or to do without ) a cheerful ( joyous , “ prompt to do it ” ) giver [ whose heart is in his giving ] . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace ( every favor and [ c ] earthly blessing ) come to you in abundance , so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need [ d ] be self-sufficient [ possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	10	And [ God ] Who provides seed for the sower and bread for eating will also provide and multiply your [ resources for ] sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness [ [ e ] which manifests itself in active goodness , kindness , and charity ] . ( C )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	11	Thus you will be enriched in all things and in every way , so that you can be generous , and [ your generosity as it is ] administered by us will bring forth thanksgiving to God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the service that the ministering of this fund renders does not only fully supply what is lacking to the saints ( God ’ s people ) , but it also overflows in many [ cries of ] thanksgiving to God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Because at [ your ] standing of the test of this ministry , they will glorify God for your loyalty and obedience to the Gospel of Christ which you confess , as well as for your generous-hearted liberality to them and to all [ the other needy ones ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And they yearn for you while they pray for you , because of the surpassing measure of God ’ s grace ( His favor and mercy and spiritual blessing which is shown forth ) in you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Now thanks be to God for His Gift , [ precious ] beyond telling [ His indescribable , inexpressible , free Gift ] ! Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	2	I entreat you when I do come [ to you ] that I may not [ be driven to such ] boldness as I intend to show toward those few who suspect us of acting according to the flesh [ on the low level of worldly motives and as if invested with only human powers ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	10	For they say , His letters are weighty and impressive and forceful and telling , but his personality and bodily presence are weak , and his speech and delivery are utterly contemptible ( of no account ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk ( live ) in the flesh , we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not physical [ weapons of flesh and blood ] , but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	5	[ Inasmuch as we ] refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the [ true ] knowledge of God ; and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	6	Being in readiness to punish every [ insubordinate for his ] disobedience , when your own submission and obedience [ as a church ] are fully secured and complete .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	7	Look at [ this obvious fact ] which is before your eyes . If anyone is confident that he is Christ ’ s , let him reflect and remind himself that even as he is Christ ’ s , so too are we .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even though I boast rather freely about our power and authority , which the Lord gave for your upbuilding and not for demolishing you , yet I shall not be put to shame [ for exceeding the truth ] ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither would I seem to be overawing or frightening you with my letters ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such people realize that what we say by letters when we are absent , [ we put ] also into deeds when we are present—
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	12	Not that we [ have the audacity to ] venture to class or [ even to ] compare ourselves with some who exalt and furnish testimonials for themselves ! However , when they measure themselves with themselves and compare themselves with one another , they are without understanding and behave unwisely .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	13	We , on the other hand , will not boast beyond our legitimate province and proper limit , but will keep within the limits [ of our commission which ] God has allotted us as our measuring line and which reaches and includes even you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overstepping the limits of our province and stretching beyond our ability to reach , as though we reached not ( had no legitimate mission ) to you , for we were [ the very first ] to come even as far as to you with the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We do not boast therefore , beyond our proper limit , over other men ’ s labors , but we have the hope and confident expectation that as your faith continues to grow , our field among you may be greatly enlarged , still within the limits of our commission ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	16	So that [ we may even ] preach the Gospel in lands [ lying ] beyond you , without making a boast of work already done in another [ man ’ s ] sphere of activity [ before we came on the scene ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	17	However , let him who boasts and glories boast and glory in the Lord . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	10	18	For [ it is ] not [ the man ] who praises and commends himself who is approved and accepted , but [ it is the person ] whom the Lord accredits and commends . Copyright ©

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	11	And why ? Because I do not love you [ do not have a preference for you , wish you well , and regard your welfare ] ? God perceives and knows that I do !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But [ now ] I am fearful , lest that even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning , so your minds may be corrupted and seduced from wholehearted and sincere and pure devotion to Christ . ( B )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For [ you seem readily to endure it ] if a man comes and preaches another Jesus than the One we preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the [ Spirit ] you [ once ] received or a different gospel from the one you [ then ] received and welcomed ; you tolerate [ all that ] well enough !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	5	Yet I consider myself as in no way inferior to these [ precious ] [ b ] extra-super [ false ] apostles .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But even if [ I am ] unskilled in speaking , yet [ I am ] not [ unskilled ] in knowledge [ I know what I am talking about ] ; we have made this evident to you in all things .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	7	But did I perhaps make a mistake and do you a wrong in debasing and cheapening myself so that you might be exalted and enriched in dignity and honor and happiness by preaching God ’ s Gospel without expense to you ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	8	Other churches I have robbed by accepting [ more than their share of ] support for my ministry [ from them in order ] to serve you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was with you and ran short financially , I did not burden any [ of you ] , for what I lacked was abundantly made up by the brethren who came from Macedonia . So I kept myself from being burdensome to you in any way , and will continue to keep [ myself from being so ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , this my boast [ of independence ] shall not be debarred ( silenced or checked ) in the regions of Achaia ( most of Greece ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , I will continue to do , [ for I am determined to maintain this independence ] in order to cut off the claim of those who would like [ to find an occasion and incentive ] to claim that in their boasted [ mission ] they work on the same terms that we do .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such men are false apostles [ spurious , counterfeits ] , deceitful workmen , masquerading as apostles ( special messengers ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And it is no wonder , for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness . [ But ] their end will correspond with their deeds .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I repeat then , let no one think I have lost my wits ; but even if you do , then bear with a witless man , so that I too may boast a little .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I say by way of this confident boasting , I say not with the Lord ’ s authority [ by inspiration ] but , as it were , in pure witlessness .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	18	[ For ] since many boast of worldly things and according to the flesh , I will glory ( boast ) also .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For you readily and gladly bear with the foolish , since you are so smart and wise yourselves !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you endure it if a man assumes control of your souls and makes slaves of you , or devours [ your substance , spends your money ] and preys upon you , or deceives and takes advantage of you , or is arrogant and puts on airs , or strikes you in the face .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my discredit , I must say , we have shown ourselves too weak [ for you to show such tolerance of us and for us to do strong , courageous things like that to you ] ! But in whatever any person is bold and dares [ to boast ] —mind you , I am speaking in this foolish ( witless ) way—I also am bold and dare [ to boast ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	22	They are Hebrews ? So am I ! They are Israelites ? So am I ! They are descendants of Abraham ? So am I !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they [ ministering ] servants of Christ ( the Messiah ) ? I am talking like one beside himself , [ but ] I am more , with far more extensive and abundant labors , with far more imprisonments , [ beaten ] with countless stripes , and frequently [ at the point of ] death .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received from [ the hands of ] the Jews forty [ lashes all ] but one ; ( C )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I have been beaten with rods ; once I was stoned . Three times I have been aboard a ship wrecked at sea ; a [ whole ] night and a day I have spent [ adrift ] on the deep ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	26	Many times on journeys , [ exposed to ] perils from rivers , perils from bandits , perils from [ my own ] nation , perils from the Gentiles , perils in the city , perils in the desert places , perils in the sea , perils from those posing as believers [ but destitute of Christian knowledge and piety ] ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	27	In toil and hardship , watching often [ through sleepless nights ] , in hunger and thirst , frequently driven to fasting by want , in cold and exposure and lack of clothing .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	28	And besides those things that are without , there is the daily [ inescapable pressure ] of my care and anxiety for all the churches !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I do not feel [ his ] weakness ? Who is made to stumble and fall and have his faith hurt , and I am not on fire [ with sorrow or indignation ] ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must boast , I will boast of the things that [ show ] my infirmity [ of the things by which I am made weak and contemptible in the eyes of my opponents ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ knows , He Who is blessed and to be praised forevermore , that I do not lie .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus , the city governor acting under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus [ on purpose ] to arrest me ,
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	11	33	And I was [ actually ] let down in a [ rope ] basket or hamper through a window ( a small door ) in the wall , and I escaped through his fingers . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	12	Indeed , the signs that indicate a [ genuine ] apostle were performed among you fully and most patiently in miracles and wonders and mighty works .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know that this man—whether in the body or away from the body I do not know , God knows—
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	4	Was caught up into paradise , and he heard utterances beyond the power of man to put into words , which man is not permitted to utter .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of this same [ man ’ s experiences ] I will boast , but of myself ( personally ) I will not boast , except as regards my infirmities ( my weaknesses ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	6	Should I desire to boast , I shall not be a witless braggart , for I shall be speaking the truth . But I abstain [ from it ] so that no one may form a higher estimate of me than [ is justified by ] what he sees in me or hears from me .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And to keep me from being puffed up and too much elated by the exceeding greatness ( preeminence ) of these revelations , there was given me a thorn ( [ a ] a splinter ) in the flesh , a messenger of Satan , to rack and buffet and harass me , to keep me from being excessively exalted . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Three times I called upon the Lord and besought [ Him ] about this and begged that it might depart from me ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But He said to me , My grace ( My favor and loving-kindness and mercy ) is enough for you [ sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully ] ; for My strength and power are made perfect ( fulfilled and completed ) and [ b ] show themselves most effective in [ your ] weakness . Therefore , I will all the more gladly glory in my weaknesses and infirmities , that the strength and power of Christ ( the Messiah ) may rest ( yes , may [ c ] pitch a tent over and dwell ) upon me !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	10	So for the sake of Christ , I am well pleased and take pleasure in infirmities , insults , hardships , persecutions , perplexities and distresses ; for when I am weak [ [ d ] in human strength ] , then am I [ truly ] strong ( able , powerful [ e ] in divine strength ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	11	Now I have been [ speaking like ] a fool ! But you forced me to it , for I ought to have been [ [ f ] saved the necessity and ] commended by you . For I have not fallen short one bit or proved myself at all inferior to those superlative [ false ] apostles [ of yours ] , even if I am nothing ( a nobody ) .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what respect were you put to a disadvantage in comparison with the rest of the churches , unless [ it was for the fact ] that I myself did not burden you [ with my financial support ] ? Pardon me [ for doing you ] this injustice !
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Now for the third time I am ready to come to [ visit ] you . And I will not burden you [ financially ] , for it is not your [ money ] that I want but you ; for children are not duty bound to lay up store for their parents , but parents for their children .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	15	But I will most gladly spend [ myself ] and be utterly spent for your souls . If I love you exceedingly , am I to be loved [ by you ] the less ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But though granting that I did not burden you [ with my support , some say that ] I was crafty [ and that ] I cheated and got the better of you with my trickery .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I [ then ] take advantage of you or make any money out of you through any of those [ messengers ] whom I sent to you ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	18	[ Actually ] I urged Titus [ to go ] , and I sent the brother with [ him ] . Did Titus overreach or take advantage of you [ in anything ] ? Did he and I not act in the same spirit ? Did we not [ take the ] same steps ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Have you been supposing [ all this time ] that we have been defending ourselves and apologizing to you ? [ It is ] in the sight and the [ very ] presence of God [ and as one ] in Christ ( the Messiah ) that we have been speaking , dearly beloved , and all in order to build you up [ spiritually ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am fearful that somehow or other I may come and find you not as I desire to find you , and that you may find me too not as you want to find me—that perhaps there may be factions ( quarreling ) , jealousy , temper ( wrath , intrigues , rivalry , divided loyalties ) , selfishness , whispering , gossip , arrogance ( self-assertion ) , and disorder among you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	12	21	[ I am fearful ] that when I come again , my God may humiliate and humble me in your regard , and that I may have to sorrow over many of those who sinned before and have not repented of the impurity , sexual vice , and sensuality which they formerly practiced .

AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All the saints ( the people of God here ) salute you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	3	Since you desire and seek [ perceptible ] proof of the Christ Who speaks in and through me . [ For He ] is not weak and feeble in dealing with you , but is a mighty power within you ;
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For though He was crucified in weakness , yet He goes on living by the power of God . And though we too are weak in Him [ as He was humanly weak ] , yet in dealing with you [ we shall show ourselves ] alive and strong in [ fellowship with ] Him by the power of God .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your faith and showing the proper fruits of it . Test and prove yourselves [ [ a ] not Christ ] . Do you not yourselves realize and know [ thoroughly by an ever-increasing experience ] that Jesus Christ is in you—unless you are [ counterfeits ] disapproved on trial and rejected ?
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I hope you will recognize and know that we are not disapproved on trial and rejected .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	7	But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong , not in order that we [ [ b ] our teaching ] may appear to be approved , but that you may continue doing right , [ though ] we may seem to have failed and be unapproved .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the Truth [ [ c ] not serve any party or personal interest ] , but only for the Truth [ [ d ] which is the Gospel ] .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	9	For we are glad when we are weak ( [ e ] unapproved ) and you are really strong . And this we also pray for : your all-round strengthening and perfecting of soul .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	10	So I write these things while I am absent from you , that when I come to you , I may not have to deal sharply in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me [ to be employed , however ] for building [ you ] up and not for tearing [ you ] down .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Finally , brethren , farewell ( rejoice ) ! Be strengthened ( perfected , completed , made what you ought to be ) ; be encouraged and consoled and comforted ; be of the same [ agreeable ] mind one with another ; live in peace , and [ then ] the God of love [ Who is the Source of affection , goodwill , love , and benevolence toward men ] and the Author and Promoter of peace will be with you .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with a consecrated kiss .
AMPC	2%20Corinthians	13	14	The grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the presence and fellowship ( the communion and sharing together , and participation ) in the Holy Spirit be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes -

AMPC	Galatians	1	1	Paul , an apostle— [ special messenger appointed and commissioned and sent out ] not from [ any body of ] men nor by or through [ a ] any man , but by and through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and God the Father , Who raised Him from among the dead—
AMPC	Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren who are with me , to the churches of Galatia :
AMPC	Galatians	1	3	Grace and spiritual blessing be to you and [ soul ] peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) ,
AMPC	Galatians	1	4	Who gave ( yielded ) Himself up [ [ b ] to atone ] for our sins [ and [ c ] to save and sanctify us ] , in order to rescue and deliver us from this present wicked age and world order , in accordance with the will and purpose and plan of our God and Father—
AMPC	Galatians	1	5	To Him [ be ascribed all ] the glory through all the ages of the ages and the eternities of the eternities ! Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	Galatians	1	6	I am surprised and astonished that you are so quickly [ d ] turning renegade and deserting Him Who invited and called you [ e ] by the grace ( unmerited favor ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) [ and that you are transferring your allegiance ] to a different [ even an opposition ] gospel .
AMPC	Galatians	1	7	Not that there is [ or could be ] any other [ genuine Gospel ] , but there are [ obviously ] some who are troubling and disturbing and bewildering you [ [ f ] with a different kind of teaching which they offer as a gospel ] and want to pervert and distort the Gospel of Christ ( the Messiah ) [ into something which it absolutely is not ] .
AMPC	Galatians	1	8	But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to and different from that which we preached to you , let him be accursed ( anathema , devoted to destruction , doomed to eternal punishment ) !
AMPC	Galatians	1	9	As we said before , so I now say again : If anyone is preaching to you a gospel different from or contrary to that which you received [ from us ] , let him be accursed ( anathema , devoted to destruction , doomed to eternal punishment ) !
AMPC	Galatians	1	10	Now am I trying to win the favor of men , or of God ? Do I seek to please men ? If I were still seeking popularity with men , I should not be a bond servant of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Galatians	1	11	For I want you to know , brethren , that the Gospel which was proclaimed and made known by me is not man ’ s gospel [ a human invention , according to or patterned after any human standard ] .
AMPC	Galatians	1	12	For indeed I did not receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but [ it came to me ] through a [ direct ] revelation [ given ] by Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Galatians	1	13	You have heard of my earlier career and former manner of life in the Jewish religion ( Judaism ) , how I persecuted and abused the church of God furiously and extensively , and [ with fanatical zeal did my best ] to make havoc of it and destroy it .
AMPC	Galatians	1	14	And [ you have heard how ] I outstripped many of the men of my own generation among the people of my race in [ my advancement in study and observance of the laws of ] Judaism , so extremely enthusiastic and zealous I was for the traditions of my ancestors .
AMPC	Galatians	1	15	But when He , Who had chosen and set me apart [ even ] before I was born and had called me by His grace ( His undeserved favor and blessing ) , saw fit and was pleased ( A )
AMPC	Galatians	1	16	To reveal ( unveil , disclose ) His Son within me so that I might proclaim Him among the Gentiles ( the non-Jewish world ) as the glad tidings ( Gospel ) , immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood [ did not consult or counsel with any frail human being or communicate with anyone ] .
AMPC	Galatians	1	17	Nor did I [ even ] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles ( special messengers of Christ ) before I was , but I went away and retired into Arabia , and afterward I came back again to Damascus .
AMPC	Galatians	1	18	Then three years later , I did go up to Jerusalem to become [ personally ] acquainted with Cephas ( Peter ) , and remained with him for fifteen days .
AMPC	Galatians	1	19	But I did not see any of the other apostles ( the special messengers of Christ ) except James the brother of our Lord .
AMPC	Galatians	1	20	Now [ note carefully what I am telling you , for it is the truth ] , I write this as if I were standing before the bar of God ; I do not lie .
AMPC	Galatians	1	21	Then I went into the districts ( countries , regions ) of Syria and Cilicia .
AMPC	Galatians	1	22	And so far I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea ( the country surrounding Jerusalem ) .
AMPC	Galatians	1	23	They were only hearing it said , He who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the very faith he once reviled and which he set out to ruin and tried with all his might to destroy .

AMPC	Galatians	2	2	I went because it was specially and divinely revealed to me that I should go , and I put before them the Gospel [ declaring to them that ] which I preach among the Gentiles . However , [ I presented the matter ] privately before those of repute , [ for I wanted to make certain , by thus at first confining my communication to this private conference ] that I was not running or had not run in vain [ guarding against being discredited either in what I was planning to do or had already done ] .
AMPC	Galatians	2	3	But [ all went well ! ] even Titus , who was with me , was not compelled [ as some had anticipated ] to be circumcised , although he was a Greek .
AMPC	Galatians	2	4	[ My precaution was ] because of false brethren who had been secretly smuggled in [ to the Christian brotherhood ] ; they had slipped in to spy on our liberty and the freedom which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might again bring us into bondage [ under the Law of Moses ] .
AMPC	Galatians	2	5	To them we did not yield submission even for a moment , that the truth of the Gospel might continue to be [ preserved ] for you [ in its purity ] .
AMPC	Galatians	2	6	Moreover , [ no new requirements were made ] by those who were reputed to be something—though what was their individual position and whether they really were of importance or not makes no difference to me ; God is not impressed with the positions that men hold and He is not partial and recognizes no external distinctions—those [ I say ] who were of repute imposed no new requirements upon me [ had nothing to add to my Gospel , and from them I received no new suggestions ] . ( A )
AMPC	Galatians	2	7	But on the contrary , when they [ really ] saw that I had been entrusted [ to carry ] the Gospel to the uncircumcised [ Gentiles , just as definitely ] as Peter had been entrusted [ to proclaim ] the Gospel to the circumcised [ Jews , they were agreeable ] ;
AMPC	Galatians	2	8	For He Who motivated and fitted Peter and worked effectively through him for the mission to the circumcised , motivated and fitted me and worked through me also for [ the mission to ] the Gentiles .
AMPC	Galatians	2	9	And when they knew ( perceived , recognized , understood , and acknowledged ) the grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor and spiritual blessing ) that had been bestowed upon me , James and Cephas ( Peter ) and John , who were reputed to be pillars of the Jerusalem church , gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , with the understanding that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised ( Jews ) .
AMPC	Galatians	2	10	They only [ made one stipulation ] , that we were to remember the poor , which very thing I was also eager to do .
AMPC	Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas ( Peter ) came to Antioch , I protested and opposed him to his face [ concerning his conduct there ] , for he was blameable and stood condemned .
AMPC	Galatians	2	12	For up to the time that certain persons came from James , he ate his meals with the Gentile [ converts ] ; but when the men [ from Jerusalem ] arrived , he withdrew and held himself aloof from the Gentiles and [ ate ] separately for fear of those of the circumcision [ party ] .
AMPC	Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews along with him also concealed their true convictions and acted insincerely , with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy ( their example of insincerity and pretense ) .
AMPC	Galatians	2	14	But as soon as I saw that they were not straightforward and were not living up to the truth of the Gospel , I said to Cephas ( Peter ) before everybody present , If you , though born a Jew , can live [ as you have been living ] like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how do you dare now to urge and practically force the Gentiles to [ comply with the ritual of Judaism and ] live like Jews ?
AMPC	Galatians	2	15	[ I went on to say ] Although we ourselves ( you and I ) are Jews by birth and not Gentile ( heathen ) sinners ,
AMPC	Galatians	2	16	Yet we know that a man is justified or reckoned righteous and in right standing with God not by works of the Law , but [ only ] through faith and [ absolute ] reliance on and adherence to and trust in Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) . [ Therefore ] even we [ ourselves ] have believed on Christ Jesus , in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the Law [ for we can not be justified by any observance of the ritual of the Law given by Moses ] , because by keeping legal rituals and by works no human being can ever be justified ( declared righteous and put in right standing with God ) . ( B )
AMPC	Galatians	2	17	But if , in our desire and endeavor to be justified in Christ [ to be declared righteous and put in right standing with God wholly and solely through Christ ] , we have shown ourselves sinners also and convicted of sin , does that make Christ a minister ( a party and contributor ) to our sin ? Banish the thought ! [ Of course not ! ]
AMPC	Galatians	2	18	For if I [ or any others who have taught that the observance of the Law of Moses is not essential to being justified by God should now by word or practice teach or intimate that it is essential to ] build up again what I tore down , I prove myself a transgressor .
AMPC	Galatians	2	19	For I through the Law [ under the operation of the curse of the Law ] have [ in Christ ’ s death for me ] myself died to the Law and all the Law ’ s demands upon me , so that I may [ henceforth ] live to and for God .
AMPC	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ [ in Him I have shared His crucifixion ] ; it is no longer I who live , but Christ ( the Messiah ) lives in me ; and the life I now live in the body I live by faith in ( by adherence to and reliance on and complete trust in ) the Son of God , Who loved me and gave Himself up for me .
AMPC	Galatians	2	21	[ Therefore , I do not treat God ’ s gracious gift as something of minor importance and defeat its very purpose ] ; I do not set aside and invalidate and frustrate and nullify the grace ( unmerited favor ) of God . For if justification ( righteousness , acquittal from guilt ) comes through [ observing the ritual of ] the Law , then Christ ( the Messiah ) died groundlessly and to no purpose and in vain . [ His death was then wholly superfluous . ] Copyright ©

AMPC	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly ? Having begun [ your new life spiritually ] with the [ Holy ] Spirit , are you now reaching perfection [ by dependence ] on the flesh ?
AMPC	Galatians	3	2	Let me ask you this one question : Did you receive the [ Holy ] Spirit as the result of obeying the Law and doing its works , or was it by hearing [ the message of the Gospel ] and believing [ it ] ? [ Was it from observing a law of rituals or from a message of faith ? ]
AMPC	Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing ( to no purpose ) —if it really is to no purpose and in vain ?
AMPC	Galatians	3	5	Then does He Who supplies you with His marvelous [ Holy ] Spirit and works powerfully and miraculously among you do so on [ the grounds of your doing ] what the Law demands , or because of your believing in and adhering to and trusting in and relying on the message that you heard ?
AMPC	Galatians	3	6	Thus Abraham believed in and adhered to and trusted in and relied on God , and it was reckoned and placed to his account and credited as righteousness ( as conformity to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action ) . ( A )
AMPC	Galatians	3	7	Know and understand that it is [ really ] the people [ who live ] by faith who are [ the true ] sons of Abraham .
AMPC	Galatians	3	8	And the Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify ( declare righteous , put in right standing with Himself ) the Gentiles in consequence of faith , proclaimed the Gospel [ foretelling the glad tidings of a Savior long beforehand ] to Abraham in the promise , saying , In you shall all the nations [ of the earth ] be blessed . ( B )
AMPC	Galatians	3	9	So then , those who are people of faith are blessed and made happy and favored by God [ as partners in fellowship ] with the believing and trusting Abraham .
AMPC	Galatians	3	10	And all who depend on the Law [ who are seeking to be justified by obedience to the Law of rituals ] are under a curse and doomed to disappointment and destruction , for it is written in the Scriptures , Cursed ( accursed , devoted to destruction , doomed to eternal punishment ) be everyone who does not continue to abide ( live and remain ) by all the precepts and commands written in the Book of the Law and to practice them . ( C )
AMPC	Galatians	3	11	Now it is evident that no person is justified ( declared righteous and brought into right standing with God ) through the Law , for the Scripture says , The man in right standing with God [ the just , the righteous ] shall live by and out of faith and he who through and by faith is declared righteous and in right standing with God shall live . ( D )
AMPC	Galatians	3	12	But the Law does not rest on faith [ does not require faith , has nothing to do with faith ] , for it itself says , He who does them [ the things prescribed by the Law ] shall live by them [ not by faith ] . ( E )
AMPC	Galatians	3	13	Christ purchased our freedom [ redeeming us ] from the curse ( doom ) of the Law [ and its condemnation ] by [ Himself ] becoming a curse for us , for it is written [ in the Scriptures ] , Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree ( is crucified ) ; ( F )
AMPC	Galatians	3	14	To the end that through [ their receiving ] Christ Jesus , the blessing [ promised ] to Abraham might come upon the Gentiles , so that we through faith might [ all ] receive [ the realization of ] the promise of the [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMPC	Galatians	3	15	To speak in terms of human relations , brethren , [ if ] even a man makes a last will and testament ( a merely human covenant ) , no one sets it aside or makes it void or adds to it when once it has been drawn up and signed ( ratified , confirmed ) .
AMPC	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises ( covenants , agreements ) were decreed and made to Abraham and his Seed ( his Offspring , his Heir ) . He [ God ] does not say , And to seeds ( descendants , heirs ) , as if referring to many persons , but , And to your Seed ( your Descendant , your Heir ) , obviously referring to one individual , Who is [ none other than ] Christ ( the Messiah ) . ( G )
AMPC	Galatians	3	17	This is my argument : The Law , which began
AMPC	Galatians	3	430	years after the covenant [ concerning the coming Messiah ] , does not and can not annul the covenant previously established ( ratified ) by God , so as to abolish the promise and make it void . ( H )
AMPC	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance [ of the promise depends on observing ] the Law [ as these false teachers would like you to believe ] , it no longer [ depends ] on the promise ; however , God gave it to Abraham [ as a free gift solely ] by virtue of His promise .
AMPC	Galatians	3	19	What then was the purpose of the Law ? It was added [ later on , after the promise , to disclose and expose to men their guilt ] because of transgressions and [ to make men more conscious of the sinfulness ] of sin ; and it was intended to be in effect until the Seed ( the Descendant , the Heir ) should come , to and concerning Whom the promise had been made . And it [ the Law ] was arranged and ordained and appointed through the instrumentality of angels [ and was given ] by the hand ( in the person ) of a go-between [ Moses , an intermediary person between God and man ] .
AMPC	Galatians	3	20	Now a go-between ( intermediary ) has to do with and implies more than one party [ there can be no mediator with just one person ] . Yet God is [ only ] one Person [ and He was the sole party in giving that promise to Abraham . But the Law was a contract between two , God and Israel ; its validity was dependent on both ] .
AMPC	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then contrary and opposed to the promises of God ? Of course not ! For if a Law had been given which could confer [ spiritual ] life , then righteousness and right standing with God would certainly have come by Law .
AMPC	Galatians	3	22	But the Scriptures [ picture all mankind as sinners ] shut up and imprisoned by sin , so that [ the inheritance , blessing ] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) might be given ( released , delivered , and committed ) to [ all ] those who believe [ who adhere to and trust in and rely on Him ] .
AMPC	Galatians	3	23	Now before the faith came , we were perpetually guarded under the Law , kept in custody in preparation for the faith that was destined to be revealed ( unveiled , disclosed ) ,
AMPC	Galatians	3	24	So that the Law served [ a ] [ to us Jews ] as our trainer [ our guardian , our guide to Christ , to lead us ] until Christ [ came ] , that we might be justified ( declared righteous , put in right standing with God ) by and through faith .
AMPC	Galatians	3	25	But now that the faith has come , we are no longer under a trainer ( the guardian of our childhood ) .
AMPC	Galatians	3	26	For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith .
AMPC	Galatians	3	27	For as many [ of you ] as were baptized into Christ [ into a spiritual union and communion with Christ , the Anointed One , the Messiah ] have put on ( clothed yourselves with ) Christ .
AMPC	Galatians	3	28	There is [ now no distinction ] neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is not male [ b ] and female ; for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	Galatians	3	29	And if you belong to Christ [ are in Him Who is Abraham ’ s Seed ] , then you are Abraham ’ s offspring and [ spiritual ] heirs according to promise . Footnotes - Galatians 3:24 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Galatians 3:28 Literal translation . Copyright ©

AMPC	Galatians	4	4	But when the proper time had fully come , God sent His Son , born of a woman , born subject to [ the regulations of ] the Law ,
AMPC	Galatians	4	2	But he is under guardians and administrators or trustees until the date fixed by his father .
AMPC	Galatians	4	3	So we [ Jewish Christians ] also , when we were minors , were kept like slaves under [ the rules of the Hebrew ritual and subject to ] the elementary teachings of a system of external observations and regulations .
AMPC	Galatians	4	5	To purchase the freedom of ( to ransom , to redeem , to [ a ] atone for ) those who were subject to the Law , that we might be adopted and have sonship conferred upon us [ and be recognized as God ’ s sons ] .
AMPC	Galatians	4	6	And because you [ really ] are [ His ] sons , God has sent the [ [ b ] Holy ] Spirit of His Son into our hearts , crying , Abba ( Father ) ! Father !
AMPC	Galatians	4	7	Therefore , you are no longer a slave ( bond servant ) but a son ; and if a son , then [ it follows that you are ] an heir [ c ] by the aid of God , through Christ .
AMPC	Galatians	4	8	But at that previous time , when you had not come to be acquainted with and understand and know the true God , you [ Gentiles ] were in bondage to gods who by their very nature could not be gods at all [ gods that really did not exist ] .
AMPC	Galatians	4	9	Now , however , that you have come to be acquainted with and understand and know [ the true ] God , or rather to be understood and known by God , how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly and worthless elementary things [ [ d ] of all religions before Christ came ] , whose slaves you once more want to become ?
AMPC	Galatians	4	10	You observe [ particular ] days and months and seasons and years !
AMPC	Galatians	4	11	I am alarmed [ about you ] , lest I have labored among and over you to no purpose and in vain .
AMPC	Galatians	4	12	Brethren , I beg of you , become as I am [ free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances ] , for I also have become as you are [ [ e ] a Gentile ] . You did me no wrong [ [ f ] in the days when I first came to you ; do not do it now ] .
AMPC	Galatians	4	13	On the contrary , you know that it was on account of a bodily ailment that [ I remained and ] preached the Gospel to you the first time .
AMPC	Galatians	4	14	And [ yet ] although my physical condition was [ such ] a trial to you , you did not regard it with contempt , or scorn and loathe and reject me ; but you received me as an angel of God , [ even ] as Christ Jesus [ Himself ] !
AMPC	Galatians	4	15	What has become of that blessed enjoyment and satisfaction and self-congratulation that once was yours [ in what I taught you and in your regard for me ] ? For I bear you witness that you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me [ to replace mine ] , if that were possible .
AMPC	Galatians	4	16	Have I then become your enemy by telling the truth to you and dealing sincerely with you ?
AMPC	Galatians	4	17	These men [ the Judaizing teachers ] are zealously trying to dazzle you [ paying court to you , making much of you ] , but their purpose is not honorable or worthy or for any good . What they want to do is to isolate you [ from us who oppose them ] , so that they may win you over to their side and get you to court their favor .
AMPC	Galatians	4	18	It is always a fine thing [ of course ] to be zealously sought after [ as you are , provided that it is ] for a good purpose and done [ g ] by reason of purity of heart and life , and not just when I am present with you !
AMPC	Galatians	4	19	My little children , for whom I am again suffering birth pangs until Christ is completely and permanently formed ( molded ) within you ,
AMPC	Galatians	4	20	Would that I were with you now and could coax you vocally , for I am fearful and perplexed about you !
AMPC	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who are bent on being under the Law , will you listen to what the Law [ really ] says ?
AMPC	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the bondmaid and one by the free woman . ( A )
AMPC	Galatians	4	23	But whereas the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh and had an ordinary birth , the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise .
AMPC	Galatians	4	24	Now all this is an allegory ; these [ two women ] represent two covenants . One covenant originated from Mount Sinai [ where the Law was given ] and bears [ children destined ] for slavery ; this is Hagar .
AMPC	Galatians	4	25	Now Hagar is ( stands for ) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to and belongs in the same category with the present Jerusalem , for she is in bondage together with her children .
AMPC	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above ( [ h ] the Messianic kingdom of Christ ) is free , and she is our mother .
AMPC	Galatians	4	27	For it is written in the Scriptures , Rejoice , O barren woman , who has not given birth to children ; break forth into a joyful shout , you who are not feeling birth pangs , for the desolate woman has many more children than she who has a husband . ( B )
AMPC	Galatians	4	28	But we , brethren , are children [ [ i ] not by physical descent , as was Ishmael , but ] like Isaac , born [ j ] in virtue of promise .
AMPC	Galatians	4	29	Yet [ just ] as at that time the child [ of ordinary birth ] born according to the flesh despised and persecuted him [ who was born remarkably ] according to [ the promise and the working of ] the [ Holy ] Spirit , so it is now also . ( C )
AMPC	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? Cast out and send away the slave woman and her son , for never shall the son of the slave woman be heir and share the inheritance with the son of the free woman . ( D )
AMPC	Galatians	4	31	So , brethren , we [ who are born again ] are not children of a slave woman [ [ k ] the natural ] , but of the free [ [ l ] the supernatural ] .

AMPC	Galatians	5	5	For we , [ not relying on the Law but ] through the [ Holy ] Spirit ’ s [ help ] , by faith anticipate and wait for the blessing and good for which our righteousness and right standing with God [ our [ b ] conformity to His will in purpose , thought , and action , causes us ] to hope .
AMPC	Galatians	5	2	Notice , it is I , Paul , who tells you that if you receive circumcision , Christ will be of no profit ( advantage , avail ) to you [ [ a ] for if you distrust Him , you can gain nothing from Him ] .
AMPC	Galatians	5	3	I once more protest and testify to every man who receives circumcision that he is under obligation and bound to practice the whole of the Law and its ordinances .
AMPC	Galatians	5	4	If you seek to be justified and declared righteous and to be given a right standing with God through the Law , you are brought to nothing and so separated ( severed ) from Christ . You have fallen away from grace ( from God ’ s gracious favor and unmerited blessing ) .
AMPC	Galatians	5	6	For [ if we are ] in Christ Jesus , neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything , but only faith activated and energized and expressed and working through love .
AMPC	Galatians	5	7	You were running the race nobly . Who has interfered in ( hindered and stopped you from ) your heeding and following the Truth ?
AMPC	Galatians	5	8	This [ evil ] persuasion is not from Him Who called you [ Who invited you to freedom in Christ ] .
AMPC	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven ( a slight inclination to error , or a few false teachers ) leavens the whole lump [ it perverts the whole conception of faith or misleads the whole church ] .
AMPC	Galatians	5	10	[ For my part ] I have confidence [ toward you ] in the Lord that you will take no contrary view of the matter but will come to think with me . But he who is unsettling you , whoever he is , will have to bear the penalty .
AMPC	Galatians	5	11	But , brethren , if I still preach circumcision [ as some accuse me of doing , as necessary to salvation ] , why am I still suffering persecution ? In that case the cross has ceased to be a stumbling block and is made meaningless ( done away ) .
AMPC	Galatians	5	12	I wish those who unsettle and confuse you would [ [ c ] go all the way and ] cut themselves off !
AMPC	Galatians	5	13	For you , brethren , were [ indeed ] called to freedom ; only [ do not let your ] freedom be an incentive to your flesh and an opportunity or excuse [ for [ d ] selfishness ] , but through love you should serve one another .
AMPC	Galatians	5	14	For the whole Law [ concerning human relationships ] is [ e ] complied with in the one precept , You shall love your neighbor as [ you do ] yourself . ( A )
AMPC	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another [ in partisan strife ] , be careful that you [ and your whole fellowship ] are not consumed by one another .
AMPC	Galatians	5	16	But I say , walk and live [ habitually ] in the [ Holy ] Spirit [ responsive to and controlled and guided by the Spirit ] ; then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and desires of the flesh ( of human nature without God ) .
AMPC	Galatians	5	17	For the desires of the flesh are opposed to the [ Holy ] Spirit , and the [ desires of the ] Spirit are opposed to the flesh ( godless human nature ) ; for these are antagonistic to each other [ continually withstanding and in conflict with each other ] , so that you are not free but are prevented from doing what you desire to do .
AMPC	Galatians	5	18	But if you are guided ( led ) by the [ Holy ] Spirit , you are not subject to the Law .
AMPC	Galatians	5	19	Now the doings ( practices ) of the flesh are clear ( obvious ) : they are immorality , impurity , indecency ,
AMPC	Galatians	5	20	Idolatry , sorcery , enmity , strife , jealousy , anger ( ill temper ) , selfishness , divisions ( dissensions ) , party spirit ( factions , sects with peculiar opinions , heresies ) ,
AMPC	Galatians	5	21	Envy , drunkenness , carousing , and the like . I warn you beforehand , just as I did previously , that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
AMPC	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the [ Holy ] Spirit [ the work which His presence within accomplishes ] is love , joy ( gladness ) , peace , patience ( an even temper , forbearance ) , kindness , goodness ( benevolence ) , faithfulness ,
AMPC	Galatians	5	23	Gentleness ( meekness , humility ) , self-control ( self-restraint , continence ) . Against such things there is no law [ [ f ] that can bring a charge ] .
AMPC	Galatians	5	24	And those who belong to Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) have crucified the flesh ( the godless human nature ) with its passions and appetites and desires .
AMPC	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the [ Holy ] Spirit , let us also walk by the Spirit . [ If by the Holy Spirit [ g ] we have our life in God , let us go forward [ h ] walking in line , our conduct controlled by the Spirit . ]
AMPC	Galatians	5	26	Let us not become vainglorious and self-conceited , competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating to one another , envying and being jealous of one another .

AMPC	Galatians	6	6	Let him who receives instruction in the Word [ of God ] share all good things with his teacher [ contributing to his support ] .
AMPC	Galatians	6	2	Bear ( endure , carry ) one another ’ s burdens and [ a ] troublesome moral faults , and in this way fulfill and observe perfectly the law of Christ ( the Messiah ) and complete [ b ] what is lacking [ in your obedience to it ] .
AMPC	Galatians	6	3	For if any person thinks himself to be somebody [ too important to condescend to shoulder another ’ s load ] when he is nobody [ of superiority except in his own estimation ] , he deceives and deludes and cheats himself .
AMPC	Galatians	6	4	But let every person carefully scrutinize and examine and test his own conduct and his own work . He can then have the personal satisfaction and joy of doing something commendable [ [ c ] in itself alone ] without [ resorting to ] boastful comparison with his neighbor .
AMPC	Galatians	6	5	For every person will have to bear ( [ d ] be equal to understanding and calmly receive ) his own [ [ e ] little ] load [ f ] [ of oppressive faults ] .
AMPC	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived and deluded and misled ; God will not allow Himself to be sneered at ( scorned , disdained , or mocked [ g ] by mere pretensions or professions , or by His precepts being set aside . ) [ He inevitably deludes himself who attempts to delude God . ] For whatever a man sows , that and [ h ] that only is what he will reap .
AMPC	Galatians	6	8	For he who sows to his own flesh ( lower nature , sensuality ) will from the flesh reap decay and ruin and destruction , but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life .
AMPC	Galatians	6	9	And let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right , for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap , if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint .
AMPC	Galatians	6	10	So then , as occasion and opportunity open up to us , let us do good [ [ i ] morally ] to all people [ not only [ j ] being useful or profitable to them , but also doing what is for their spiritual good and advantage ] . Be mindful to be a blessing , especially to those of the household of faith [ those who belong to God ’ s family with you , the believers ] .
AMPC	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I am writing with my own hand . [ [ k ] Mark carefully these closing words of mine . ]
AMPC	Galatians	6	12	Those who want to make a good impression and a fine show in the flesh would try to compel you to receive circumcision , simply so that they may escape being persecuted for allegiance to the cross of Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Galatians	6	13	For even the circumcised [ Jews ] themselves do not [ really ] keep the Law , but they want to have you circumcised in order that they may glory in your flesh ( your subjection to external rites ) .
AMPC	Galatians	6	14	But far be it from me to glory [ in anything or anyone ] except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) through Whom the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world !
AMPC	Galatians	6	15	For neither is circumcision [ now ] of any importance , nor uncircumcision , but [ only ] a new creation [ the result of a new birth and a new nature in Christ Jesus , the Messiah ] .
AMPC	Galatians	6	16	Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule [ who discipline themselves and regulate their lives by this principle ] , even upon the [ true ] Israel of God ! ( A )
AMPC	Galatians	6	17	From now on let no person trouble me [ by [ l ] making it necessary for me to vindicate my apostolic authority and the divine truth of my Gospel ] , for I bear on my body the [ brand ] marks of the Lord Jesus [ the wounds , scars , and other outward evidence of persecutions—these testify to His ownership of me ] !

AMPC	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , an apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , by the divine will ( the purpose and the choice of God ) to the saints ( the consecrated , set-apart ones ) [ a ] at Ephesus who are also faithful and loyal and steadfast in Christ Jesus :
AMPC	Ephesians	1	2	May grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) and spiritual peace [ which means peace with God and harmony , unity , and undisturbedness ] be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	3	May blessing ( praise , laudation , and eulogy ) be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) Who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual ( given by the Holy Spirit ) blessing in the heavenly realm !
AMPC	Ephesians	1	4	Even as [ in His love ] He chose us [ actually picked us out for Himself as His own ] in Christ before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy ( consecrated and set apart for Him ) and blameless in His sight , even above reproach , before Him in love .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	5	For He foreordained us ( destined us , planned in love for us ) to be adopted ( revealed ) as His own children through Jesus Christ , in accordance with the purpose of His will [ [ b ] because it pleased Him and was His kind intent ] —
AMPC	Ephesians	1	6	[ So that we might be ] to the praise and the commendation of His glorious grace ( favor and mercy ) , which He so freely bestowed on us in the Beloved .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	7	In Him we have redemption ( deliverance and salvation ) through His blood , the remission ( forgiveness ) of our offenses ( shortcomings and trespasses ) , in accordance with the riches and the generosity of His gracious favor ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	8	Which He lavished upon us in every kind of wisdom and understanding ( practical insight and prudence ) ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	9	Making known to us the mystery ( secret ) of His will ( of His plan , of His purpose ) . [ And it is this : ] In accordance with His good pleasure ( His merciful intention ) which He had previously purposed and set forth in [ c ] Him ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	10	[ He planned ] for the maturity of the times and the climax of the ages to unify all things and head them up and consummate them in Christ , [ both ] things in heaven and things on the earth .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	11	In Him we also were made [ God ’ s ] heritage ( portion ) and we obtained an inheritance ; for we had been foreordained ( chosen and appointed beforehand ) in accordance with His purpose , Who works out everything in agreement with the counsel and design of His [ own ] will ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	12	So that we who first hoped in Christ [ who first put our confidence in Him have been destined and appointed to ] live for the praise of His glory !
AMPC	Ephesians	1	13	In Him you also who have heard the Word of Truth , the glad tidings ( Gospel ) of your salvation , and have believed in and adhered to and relied on Him , were stamped with the seal of the long-promised Holy Spirit .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	14	That [ Spirit ] is the guarantee of our inheritance [ the firstfruits , the pledge and foretaste , the down payment on our heritage ] , in anticipation of its full redemption and our acquiring [ complete ] possession of it—to the praise of His glory .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	15	For this reason , because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints ( the people of God ) ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	16	I do not cease to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	17	[ For I always pray to ] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [ of insight into mysteries and secrets ] in the [ deep and intimate ] knowledge of Him ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	18	By having the eyes of your heart flooded with light , so that you can know and understand the hope to which He has called you , and how rich is His glorious inheritance in the saints ( His set-apart ones ) ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	19	And [ so that you can know and understand ] what is the immeasurable and unlimited and surpassing greatness of His power in and for us who believe , as demonstrated in the working of His mighty strength ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	20	Which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His [ own ] right hand in the heavenly [ places ] ,
AMPC	Ephesians	1	21	Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named [ above every title that can be conferred ] , not only in this age and in this world , but also in the age and the world which are to come .
AMPC	Ephesians	1	22	And He has put all things under His feet and has appointed Him the universal and supreme Head of the church [ a headship exercised throughout the church ] , ( A )
AMPC	Ephesians	1	23	Which is His body , the fullness of Him Who fills all in all [ for in that body lives the full measure of Him Who makes everything complete , and Who fills everything everywhere with Himself ] .

AMPC	Ephesians	2	2	In which at one time you walked [ habitually ] . You were following the course and fashion of this world [ were under the sway of the tendency of this present age ] , following the prince of the power of the air . [ You were obedient to and under the control of ] the [ demon ] spirit that still constantly works in the sons of disobedience [ the careless , the rebellious , and the unbelieving , who go against the purposes of God ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	3	Among these we as well as you once lived and conducted ourselves in the passions of our flesh [ our behavior governed by our corrupt and sensual nature ] , obeying the impulses of the flesh and the thoughts of the mind [ our cravings dictated by our senses and our dark imaginings ] . We were then by nature children of [ God ’ s ] wrath and heirs of [ His ] indignation , like the rest of mankind .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	4	But God—so rich is He in His mercy ! Because of and in order to satisfy the great and wonderful and intense love with which He loved us ,
AMPC	Ephesians	2	5	Even when we were dead ( slain ) by [ our own ] shortcomings and trespasses , He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ ; [ He gave us the very life of Christ Himself , the same new life with which He quickened Him , for ] it is by grace ( His favor and mercy which you did not deserve ) that you are saved ( [ a ] delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ ’ s salvation ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	6	And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [ giving us [ b ] joint seating with Him ] in the heavenly sphere [ by virtue of our being ] in Christ Jesus ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	7	He did this that He might clearly demonstrate through the ages to come the immeasurable ( limitless , surpassing ) riches of His free grace ( His unmerited favor ) in [ His ] kindness and goodness of heart toward us in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	8	For it is by free grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) that you are saved ( [ c ] delivered from judgment and made partakers of Christ ’ s salvation ) through [ your ] faith . And this [ salvation ] is not of yourselves [ of your own doing , it came not through your own striving ] , but it is the gift of God ;
AMPC	Ephesians	2	9	Not because of works [ not the fulfillment of the Law ’ s demands ] , lest any man should boast . [ It is not the result of what anyone can possibly do , so no one can pride himself in it or take glory to himself . ]
AMPC	Ephesians	2	10	For we are God ’ s [ own ] handiwork ( His workmanship ) , [ d ] recreated in Christ Jesus , [ born anew ] that we may do those good works which God predestined ( planned beforehand ) for us [ taking paths which He prepared ahead of time ] , that we should walk in them [ living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore , remember that at one time you were Gentiles ( heathens ) in the flesh , called Uncircumcision by those who called themselves Circumcision , [ itself a [ e ] mere mark ] in the flesh made by human hands .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	12	[ Remember ] that you were at that time separated ( living apart ) from Christ [ excluded from all part in Him ] , utterly estranged and outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation , and strangers with no share in the sacred compacts of the [ Messianic ] promise [ with no knowledge of or right in God ’ s agreements , His covenants ] . And you had no hope ( no promise ) ; you were in the world without God .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus , you who once were [ so ] far away , through ( by , in ) the blood of Christ have been brought near .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	14	For He is [ Himself ] our peace ( our bond of unity and harmony ) . He has made us both [ Jew and Gentile ] one [ body ] , and has broken down ( destroyed , abolished ) the hostile dividing wall between us ,
AMPC	Ephesians	2	15	By abolishing in His [ own crucified ] flesh the enmity [ caused by ] the Law with its decrees and ordinances [ which He annulled ] ; that He from the two might create in Himself one new man [ one new quality of humanity out of the two ] , so making peace .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	16	And [ He designed ] to reconcile to God both [ Jew and Gentile , united ] in a single body by means of His cross , thereby killing the mutual enmity and bringing the feud to an end .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	17	And He came and preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off and [ peace ] to those who were near . ( A )
AMPC	Ephesians	2	18	For it is through Him that we both [ whether far off or near ] now have an introduction ( access ) by one [ Holy ] Spirit to the Father [ so that we are able to approach Him ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	19	Therefore you are no longer outsiders ( exiles , migrants , and aliens , excluded from the rights of citizens ) , but you now share citizenship with the saints ( God ’ s own people , consecrated and set apart for Himself ) ; and you belong to God ’ s [ own ] household .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	20	You are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus Himself the chief Cornerstone .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	21	In Him the whole structure is joined ( bound , welded ) together harmoniously , and it continues to rise ( grow , increase ) into a holy temple in the Lord [ a sanctuary dedicated , consecrated , and sacred to the presence of the Lord ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	2	22	In Him [ and in fellowship with one another ] you yourselves also are being built up [ into this structure ] with the rest , to form a fixed abode ( dwelling place ) of God in ( by , through ) the Spirit .

AMPC	Ephesians	3	3	[ And ] that the mystery ( secret ) was made known to me and I was allowed to comprehend it by direct revelation , as I already briefly wrote you .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	2	Assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God ’ s grace ( His unmerited favor ) that was entrusted to me [ to dispense to you ] for your benefit ,
AMPC	Ephesians	3	4	When you read this you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	5	[ This mystery ] was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles ( consecrated messengers ) and prophets by the [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	6	[ It is this : ] that the Gentiles are now to be fellow heirs [ with the Jews ] , members of the same body and joint partakers [ sharing ] in the same divine promise in Christ through [ their acceptance of ] the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	7	Of this [ Gospel ] I was made a minister according to the gift of God ’ s free grace ( undeserved favor ) which was bestowed on me by the exercise ( the working in all its effectiveness ) of His power .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	8	To me , though I am the very least of all the saints ( God ’ s consecrated people ) , this grace ( favor , privilege ) was granted and graciously entrusted : to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending ( boundless , fathomless , incalculable , and exhaustless ) riches of Christ [ wealth which no human being could have searched out ] ,
AMPC	Ephesians	3	9	Also to enlighten all men and make plain to them what is the plan [ regarding the Gentiles and providing for the salvation of all men ] of the mystery kept hidden through the ages and concealed until now in [ the mind of ] God Who created all things by Christ Jesus .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	10	[ The purpose is ] that through the church the [ c ] complicated , many-sided wisdom of God in all its infinite variety and innumerable aspects might now be made known to the angelic rulers and authorities ( principalities and powers ) in the heavenly sphere .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	11	This is in accordance with the terms of the eternal and timeless purpose which He has realized and carried into effect in [ the person of ] Christ Jesus our Lord ,
AMPC	Ephesians	3	12	In Whom , because of our faith in Him , we dare to have the boldness ( courage and confidence ) of free access ( an unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	13	So I ask you not to lose heart [ not to faint or become despondent through fear ] at what I am suffering in your behalf . [ Rather glory in it ] for it is an honor to you .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason [ [ d ] seeing the greatness of this plan by which you are built together in Christ ] , I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
AMPC	Ephesians	3	15	For Whom every family in heaven and on earth is named [ that Father from Whom all fatherhood takes its title and derives its name ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	16	May He grant you out of the rich treasury of His glory to be strengthened and reinforced with mighty power in the inner man by the [ Holy ] Spirit [ Himself indwelling your innermost being and personality ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	3	17	May Christ through your faith [ actually ] dwell ( settle down , abide , make His permanent home ) in your hearts ! May you be rooted deep in love and founded securely on love ,
AMPC	Ephesians	3	18	That you may have the power and be strong to apprehend and grasp with all the saints [ God ’ s devoted people , the experience of that love ] what is the breadth and length and height and depth [ of it ] ;
AMPC	Ephesians	3	19	[ That you may really come ] to know [ practically , [ e ] through experience for yourselves ] the love of Christ , which far surpasses [ f ] mere knowledge [ without experience ] ; that you may be filled [ through all your being ] [ g ] unto all the fullness of God [ may have the richest measure of the divine Presence , and [ h ] become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself ] !
AMPC	Ephesians	3	20	Now to Him Who , by ( in consequence of ) the [ action of His ] power that is at work within us , is able to [ carry out His purpose and ] do superabundantly , far over and above all that we [ dare ] ask or think [ infinitely beyond our highest prayers , desires , thoughts , hopes , or dreams ] —
AMPC	Ephesians	3	21	To Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever . Amen ( so be it ) .

AMPC	Ephesians	4	4	[ There is ] one body and one Spirit—just as there is also one hope [ that belongs ] to the calling you received—
AMPC	Ephesians	4	2	Living as becomes you ] with complete lowliness of mind ( humility ) and meekness ( unselfishness , gentleness , mildness ) , with patience , bearing with one another and making allowances because you love one another .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	3	Be eager and strive earnestly to guard and keep the harmony and oneness of [ and produced by ] the Spirit in the binding power of peace .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	5	[ There is ] one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
AMPC	Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of [ us ] all , Who is above all [ Sovereign over all ] , pervading all and [ living ] in [ us ] all .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	7	Yet grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) was given to each of us individually [ not indiscriminately , but in different ways ] in proportion to the measure of Christ ’ s [ rich and bounteous ] gift .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore it is said , When He ascended on high , He led captivity captive [ He led a train of [ a ] vanquished foes ] and He bestowed gifts on men . ( A )
AMPC	Ephesians	4	9	[ But He ascended ? ] Now what can this , He ascended , mean but that He had previously descended from [ the heights of ] heaven into [ the depths ] , the lower parts of the earth ?
AMPC	Ephesians	4	10	He Who descended is the [ very ] same as He Who also has ascended high above all the heavens , that He [ His presence ] might fill all things ( the whole universe , from the lowest to the highest ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	11	And His gifts were [ varied ; He Himself appointed and gave men to us ] some to be apostles ( special messengers ) , some prophets ( inspired preachers and expounders ) , some evangelists ( preachers of the Gospel , traveling missionaries ) , some pastors ( shepherds of His flock ) and teachers .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	12	His intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the saints ( His consecrated people ) , [ that they should do ] the work of ministering toward building up Christ ’ s body ( the church ) ,
AMPC	Ephesians	4	13	[ That it might develop ] until we all attain oneness in the faith and in the comprehension of the [ [ b ] full and accurate ] knowledge of the Son of God , that [ we might arrive ] at really mature manhood ( the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ ’ s own perfection ) , the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ and the completeness found in Him .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	14	So then , we may no longer be children , tossed [ like ships ] to and fro between chance gusts of teaching and wavering with every changing wind of doctrine , [ the prey of ] the cunning and cleverness of [ c ] unscrupulous men , [ gamblers engaged ] in every shifting form of trickery in inventing errors to mislead .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	15	Rather , let our lives lovingly [ d ] express truth [ in all things , speaking truly , dealing truly , living truly ] . Enfolded in love , let us grow up in every way and in all things into Him Who is the Head , [ even ] Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	16	For because of Him the whole body ( the church , in all its various parts ) , closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied , when each part [ with power adapted to its need ] is working properly [ in all its functions ] , grows to full maturity , building itself up in love .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	17	So this I say and solemnly testify in [ the name of ] the Lord [ as in His presence ] , that you must no longer live as the heathen ( the Gentiles ) do in their perverseness [ in the folly , vanity , and emptiness of their souls and the futility ] of their minds .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	18	Their [ e ] moral understanding is darkened and their reasoning is beclouded . [ They are ] alienated ( estranged , self-banished ) from the life of God [ with no share in it ; this is ] because of the ignorance ( the want of knowledge and perception , the willful blindness ) that is [ f ] deep-seated in them , due to their hardness of heart [ to the insensitiveness of their moral nature ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	19	In their spiritual apathy they have become callous and past feeling and reckless and have abandoned themselves [ a prey ] to unbridled sensuality , eager and greedy to indulge in every form of impurity [ that their depraved desires may suggest and demand ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	20	But you did not so learn Christ !
AMPC	Ephesians	4	21	Assuming that you have really heard Him and been taught by Him , as [ all ] Truth is in Jesus [ embodied and personified in Him ] ,
AMPC	Ephesians	4	22	Strip yourselves of your former nature [ put off and discard your old unrenewed self ] which characterized your previous manner of life and becomes corrupt through lusts and desires that spring from delusion ;
AMPC	Ephesians	4	23	And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [ having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude ] ,
AMPC	Ephesians	4	24	And put on the new nature ( the regenerate self ) created in God ’ s image , [ Godlike ] in true righteousness and holiness .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , rejecting all falsity and being done now with it , let everyone express the truth with his neighbor , for we are all parts of one body and members one of another . ( B )
AMPC	Ephesians	4	26	When angry , do not sin ; do not ever let your wrath ( your exasperation , your fury or indignation ) last until the sun goes down .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	27	Leave no [ such ] room or foothold for the devil [ give no opportunity to him ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	28	Let the thief steal no more , but rather let him be industrious , making an honest living with his own hands , so that he may be able to give to those in need .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	29	Let no foul or polluting language , nor evil word nor unwholesome or worthless talk [ ever ] come out of your mouth , but only such [ speech ] as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others , as is fitting to the need and the occasion , that it may be a blessing and give grace ( God ’ s favor ) to those who hear it .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God [ do not offend or vex or sadden Him ] , by Whom you were sealed ( marked , branded as God ’ s own , secured ) for the day of redemption ( of final deliverance through Christ from evil and the consequences of sin ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness and indignation and wrath ( passion , rage , bad temper ) and resentment ( anger , animosity ) and quarreling ( brawling , clamor , contention ) and slander ( evil-speaking , abusive or blasphemous language ) be banished from you , with all malice ( spite , ill will , or baseness of any kind ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	4	32	And become useful and helpful and kind to one another , tenderhearted ( compassionate , understanding , loving-hearted ) , forgiving one another [ readily and freely ] , as God in Christ forgave you .

AMPC	Ephesians	5	5	For be sure of this : that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life , or one who is covetous [ who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain ] —for he [ in effect ] is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love , [ esteeming and delighting in one another ] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us , a [ a ] slain offering and sacrifice to God [ for you , so that it became ] a sweet fragrance . ( A )
AMPC	Ephesians	5	3	But immorality ( sexual vice ) and all impurity [ [ b ] of lustful , rich , wasteful living ] or greediness must not even be named among you , as is fitting and proper among saints ( God ’ s consecrated people ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	4	Let there be no filthiness ( obscenity , indecency ) nor foolish and sinful ( silly and corrupt ) talk , nor coarse jesting , which are not fitting or becoming ; but instead voice your thankfulness [ to God ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one delude and deceive you with empty excuses and groundless arguments [ for these sins ] , for through these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of rebellion and disobedience .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	7	So do not associate or be sharers with them .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	8	For once you were darkness , but now you are light in the Lord ; walk as children of Light [ lead the lives of those native-born to the Light ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	9	For the fruit ( the effect , the product ) of the Light or [ c ] the Spirit [ consists ] in every form of kindly goodness , uprightness of heart , and trueness of life .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	10	And try to learn [ in your experience ] what is pleasing to the Lord [ let your lives be constant proofs of what is most acceptable to Him ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	11	Take no part in and have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds and enterprises of darkness , but instead [ let your lives be so in contrast as to ] [ d ] expose and reprove and convict them .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	12	For it is a shame even to speak of or mention the things that [ such people ] practice in secret .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	13	But when anything is exposed and reproved by the light , it is made visible and clear ; and where everything is visible and clear there is light .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	14	Therefore He says , Awake , O sleeper , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall shine ( make day dawn ) upon you and give you light . ( B )
AMPC	Ephesians	5	15	Look carefully then how you walk ! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately , not as the unwise and witless , but as wise ( sensible , intelligent people ) ,
AMPC	Ephesians	5	16	Making the very most of the time [ buying up each opportunity ] , because the days are evil .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	17	Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish , but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	18	And do not get drunk with wine , for that is debauchery ; but ever be filled and stimulated with the [ Holy ] Spirit . ( C )
AMPC	Ephesians	5	19	Speak out to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , offering praise with voices [ [ e ] and instruments ] and making melody with all your heart to the Lord ,
AMPC	Ephesians	5	20	At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	21	Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , be subject ( be submissive and adapt yourselves ) to your own husbands as [ a service ] to the Lord .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the Head of the church , Himself the Savior of [ His ] body .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	24	As the church is subject to Christ , so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her ,
AMPC	Ephesians	5	26	So that He might sanctify her , having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word ,
AMPC	Ephesians	5	27	That He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor , without spot or wrinkle or any such things [ that she might be holy and faultless ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	5	28	Even so husbands should love their wives as [ being in a sense ] their own bodies . He who loves his own wife loves himself .

AMPC	Ephesians	6	6	Not in the way of eye-service [ as if they were watching you ] and only to please men , but as servants ( slaves ) of Christ , doing the will of God heartily and with your whole soul ;
AMPC	Ephesians	6	2	Honor ( esteem and value as precious ) your father and your mother—this is the first commandment with a promise— ( A )
AMPC	Ephesians	6	3	That all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , do not irritate and provoke your children to anger [ do not exasperate them to resentment ] , but rear them [ tenderly ] in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonition of the Lord .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	5	Servants ( slaves ) , be obedient to those who are your physical masters , having respect for them and eager concern to please them , in singleness of motive and with all your heart , as [ service ] to Christ [ Himself ] —
AMPC	Ephesians	6	7	Rendering service readily with goodwill , as to the Lord and not to men ,
AMPC	Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that for whatever good anyone does , he will receive his reward from the Lord , whether he is slave or free .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	9	You masters , act on the same [ principle ] toward them and give up threatening and using violent and abusive words , knowing that He Who is both their Master and yours is in heaven , and that there is no respect of persons ( no partiality ) with Him .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	10	In conclusion , be strong in the Lord [ be empowered through your union with Him ] ; draw your strength from Him [ that strength which His boundless might provides ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	11	Put on God ’ s whole armor [ the armor of a heavy-armed soldier which God supplies ] , that you may be able successfully to stand up against [ all ] the strategies and the deceits of the devil .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	12	For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood [ contending only with physical opponents ] , but against the despotisms , against the powers , against [ the master spirits who are ] the world rulers of this present darkness , against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly ( supernatural ) sphere .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore put on God ’ s complete armor , that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [ of danger ] , and , having done all [ the crisis demands ] , to stand [ firmly in your place ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore [ hold your ground ] , having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God ,
AMPC	Ephesians	6	15	And having shod your feet in preparation [ to face the enemy with the [ a ] firm-footed stability , the promptness , and the readiness [ b ] produced by the good news ] of the Gospel of peace . ( B )
AMPC	Ephesians	6	16	Lift up over all the [ covering ] shield of [ c ] saving faith , upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked [ one ] .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword that the Spirit [ d ] wields , which is the Word of God .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	18	Pray at all times ( on every occasion , in every season ) in the Spirit , with all [ manner of ] prayer and entreaty . To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance , interceding in behalf of all the saints ( God ’ s consecrated people ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	19	And [ pray ] also for me , that [ freedom of ] utterance may be given me , that I may open my mouth to proclaim boldly the mystery of the good news ( the Gospel ) ,
AMPC	Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in a coupling chain [ in prison . Pray ] that I may declare it boldly and courageously , as I ought to do .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	21	Now that you may know how I am and what I am doing , Tychicus , the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord [ and His service ] , will tell you everything .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	22	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are and that he may [ e ] console and cheer and encourage and strengthen your hearts .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren , and love joined with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Ephesians	6	24	Grace ( God ’ s undeserved favor ) be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying and incorruptible [ love ] . Amen ( so let it be ) .

AMPC	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy , bond servants of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , to all the saints ( God ’ s consecrated people ) in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi , with the bishops ( overseers ) and deacons ( assistants ) :
AMPC	Philippians	1	2	Grace ( favor and blessing ) to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God in all my remembrance of you .
AMPC	Philippians	1	4	In every prayer of mine I always make my entreaty and petition for you all with joy ( delight ) .
AMPC	Philippians	1	5	[ I thank my God ] for your fellowship ( your [ a ] sympathetic cooperation and contributions and partnership ) in advancing the good news ( the Gospel ) from the first day [ you heard it ] until now .
AMPC	Philippians	1	6	And I am convinced and sure of this very thing , that He Who began a good work in you will continue until the day of Jesus Christ [ right up to the time of His return ] , developing [ that good work ] and perfecting and bringing it to full completion in you .
AMPC	Philippians	1	7	It is right and appropriate for me to have this confidence and feel this way about you all , because [ b ] you have me in your heart and I hold you in my heart as partakers and sharers , one and all with me , of grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor and spiritual blessing ) . [ This is true ] both when I am shut up in prison and when I am out in the defense and confirmation of the good news ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness how I long for and [ c ] pursue you all with love , in the tender mercy of Christ Jesus [ Himself ] !
AMPC	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray : that your love may abound yet more and more and extend to its fullest development in knowledge and all keen insight [ that your love may [ d ] display itself in greater depth of acquaintance and more comprehensive discernment ] ,
AMPC	Philippians	1	10	So that you may surely learn to sense what is vital , and approve and prize what is excellent and of real value [ recognizing the highest and the best , and distinguishing the moral differences ] , and that you may be untainted and pure and unerring and blameless [ so that with hearts sincere and certain and unsullied , you may approach ] the day of Christ [ not stumbling nor causing others to stumble ] .
AMPC	Philippians	1	11	May you abound in and be filled with the fruits of righteousness ( of right standing with God and right doing ) which come through Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) , to the honor and praise of God [ [ e ] that His glory may be both manifested and recognized ] .
AMPC	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know and continue to rest assured , brethren , that what [ has happened ] to me [ this imprisonment ] has actually only served to advance and give a renewed impetus to the [ spreading of the ] good news ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	Philippians	1	13	So much is this a fact that throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest [ here ] my imprisonment has become generally known to be in Christ [ that I am a prisoner in His service and for Him ] .
AMPC	Philippians	1	14	And [ also ] most of the brethren have derived fresh confidence in the Lord because of my chains and are much more bold to speak and publish fearlessly the Word of God [ acting with more freedom and indifference to the consequences ] .
AMPC	Philippians	1	15	Some , it is true , [ actually ] preach Christ ( the Messiah ) [ for no better reason than ] out of envy and rivalry ( party spirit ) , but others are doing so out of a loyal spirit and goodwill .
AMPC	Philippians	1	16	and
AMPC	Philippians	1	17	is that of the most ancient manuscripts ; the King James Version has them reversed . - Philippians 1:19 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Philippians 1:19 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . Copyright ©
AMPC	Philippians	1	18	But what does it matter , so long as either way , whether in pretense [ for personal ends ] or in all honesty [ for the furtherance of the Truth ] , Christ is being proclaimed ? And in that I [ now ] rejoice , yes , and I shall rejoice [ hereafter ] also .
AMPC	Philippians	1	19	For I am well assured and indeed know that through your prayers and a [ h ] bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) this will turn out for my preservation ( for the spiritual health and [ i ] welfare of my own soul ) and avail toward the saving work of the Gospel .
AMPC	Philippians	1	20	This is in keeping with my own eager desire and persistent expectation and hope , that I shall not disgrace myself nor be put to shame in anything ; but that with the utmost freedom of speech and unfailing courage , now as always heretofore , Christ ( the Messiah ) will be magnified and get glory and praise in this body of mine and be boldly exalted in my person , whether through ( by ) life or through ( by ) death .
AMPC	Philippians	1	21	For me to live is Christ [ His life in me ] , and to die is gain [ the gain of the glory of eternity ] .
AMPC	Philippians	1	22	If , however , it is to be life in the flesh and I am to live on here , that means fruitful service for me ; so I can say nothing as to my personal preference [ I can not choose ] ,
AMPC	Philippians	1	23	But I am hard pressed between the two . My yearning desire is to depart ( to be free of this world , to set forth ) and be with Christ , for that is far , far better ;
AMPC	Philippians	1	24	But to remain in my body is more needful and essential for your sake .
AMPC	Philippians	1	25	Since I am convinced of this , I know that I shall remain and stay by you all , to promote your progress and joy in believing ,
AMPC	Philippians	1	26	So that in me you may have abundant cause for exultation and glorying in Christ Jesus , through my coming to you again .
AMPC	Philippians	1	27	Only be sure as citizens so to conduct yourselves [ that ] your manner of life [ will be ] worthy of the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ , so that whether I [ do ] come and see you or am absent , I may hear this of you : that you are standing firm in united spirit and purpose , striving side by side and contending with a single mind for the faith of the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	Philippians	1	28	And do not [ for a moment ] be frightened or intimidated in anything by your opponents and adversaries , for such [ constancy and fearlessness ] will be a clear sign ( proof and seal ) to them of [ their impending ] destruction , but [ a sure token and evidence ] of your deliverance and salvation , and that from God .
AMPC	Philippians	1	29	For you have been granted [ the privilege ] for Christ ’ s sake not only to believe in ( adhere to , rely on , and trust in ) Him , but also to suffer in His behalf .
AMPC	Philippians	1	30	So you are engaged in the same conflict which you saw me [ wage ] and which you now hear to be mine [ still ] .

AMPC	Philippians	2	2	Fill up and complete my joy by living in harmony and being of the same mind and one in purpose , having the same love , being in full accord and of one harmonious mind and intention .
AMPC	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing from factional motives [ through contentiousness , strife , selfishness , or for unworthy ends ] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance . Instead , in the true spirit of humility ( lowliness of mind ) let each regard the others as better than and superior to himself [ thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves ] .
AMPC	Philippians	2	4	Let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not [ merely ] his own interests , but also each for the interests of others .
AMPC	Philippians	2	5	Let this same attitude and purpose and [ humble ] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus : [ Let Him be your example in humility : ]
AMPC	Philippians	2	6	Who , although being essentially one with God and in the form of God [ [ b ] possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God ] , did not [ c ] think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped [ d ] or retained ,
AMPC	Philippians	2	7	But stripped Himself [ of all privileges and [ e ] rightful dignity ] , so as to assume the guise of a servant ( slave ) , in that He became like men and was born a human being .
AMPC	Philippians	2	8	And after He had appeared in human form , He abased and humbled Himself [ still further ] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death , even the death of the cross !
AMPC	Philippians	2	9	Therefore [ because He stooped so low ] God has highly exalted Him and has [ f ] freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name ,
AMPC	Philippians	2	10	That in ( at ) the name of Jesus every knee [ g ] should ( must ) bow , in heaven and on earth and under the earth ,
AMPC	Philippians	2	11	And every tongue [ [ h ] frankly and openly ] confess and acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
AMPC	Philippians	2	12	Therefore , my dear ones , as you have always obeyed [ my suggestions ] , so now , not only [ with the enthusiasm you would show ] in my presence but much more because I am absent , work out ( cultivate , carry out to the goal , and fully complete ) your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling ( self-distrust , [ i ] with serious caution , tenderness of conscience , watchfulness against temptation , timidly shrinking from whatever might offend God and discredit the name of Christ ) .
AMPC	Philippians	2	13	[ Not in your own strength ] for it is God Who is all the while [ j ] effectually at work in you [ energizing and creating in you the power and desire ] , both to will and to work for His good pleasure and satisfaction and [ k ] delight .
AMPC	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without grumbling and faultfinding and complaining [ [ l ] against God ] and [ m ] questioning and doubting [ among yourselves ] ,
AMPC	Philippians	2	15	That you may show yourselves to be blameless and guileless , innocent and uncontaminated , children of God without blemish ( faultless , unrebukable ) in the midst of a crooked and wicked generation [ spiritually perverted and perverse ] , among whom you are seen as bright lights ( stars or beacons shining out clearly ) in the [ dark ] world ,
AMPC	Philippians	2	16	Holding out [ to it ] and offering [ to all men ] the Word of Life , so that in the day of Christ I may have something of which exultantly to rejoice and glory in that I did not run my race in vain or spend my labor to no purpose .
AMPC	Philippians	2	17	Even if [ my lifeblood ] must be poured out as a libation on the sacrificial offering of your faith [ to God ] , still I am glad [ to do it ] and [ n ] congratulate you all on [ your share in ] it .
AMPC	Philippians	2	18	And you also in like manner be glad and [ o ] congratulate me on [ my share in ] it .
AMPC	Philippians	2	19	But I hope and trust in the Lord Jesus soon to send Timothy to you , so that I may also be encouraged and cheered by learning news of you .
AMPC	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one like him [ no one of so kindred a spirit ] who will be so genuinely interested in your welfare and devoted to your interests .
AMPC	Philippians	2	21	For the others all seek [ to advance ] their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Philippians	2	22	But Timothy ’ s tested worth you know , how as a son with his father he has toiled with me zealously in [ serving and helping to advance ] the good news ( the Gospel ) .
AMPC	Philippians	2	23	I hope therefore to send him promptly , just as soon as I know how my case is going to turn out .
AMPC	Philippians	2	24	But [ really ] I am confident and fully trusting in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come to you also .
AMPC	Philippians	2	25	However , I thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus [ back ] to you . [ He has been ] my brother and companion in labor and my fellow soldier , as well as [ having come as ] your special messenger ( apostle ) and minister to my need .
AMPC	Philippians	2	26	For he has been [ homesick ] longing for you all and has been distressed because you had heard that he was ill.
AMPC	Philippians	2	27	He certainly was ill [ too ] , near to death . But God had compassion on him , and not only on him but also on me , lest I should have sorrow [ over him ] [ p ] coming upon sorrow .
AMPC	Philippians	2	28	So I have sent him the more willingly and eagerly , that you may be gladdened at seeing him again , and that I may be the less disquieted .
AMPC	Philippians	2	29	Welcome him [ home ] then in the Lord with all joy , and honor and highly appreciate men like him ,
AMPC	Philippians	2	30	For it was through working for Christ that he came so near death , risking his [ very ] life to complete the deficiencies in your service to me [ which distance prevented you yourselves from rendering ] .

AMPC	Philippians	3	3	For we [ Christians ] are the true circumcision , who worship God in spirit and by the Spirit of God and exult and glory and pride ourselves in Jesus Christ , and put no confidence or dependence [ on what we are ] in the flesh and on outward privileges and physical advantages and external appearances—
AMPC	Philippians	3	2	Look out for those dogs [ Judaizers , legalists ] , look out for those mischief-makers , look out for those who mutilate the flesh .
AMPC	Philippians	3	4	Though for myself I have [ at least grounds ] to rely on the flesh . If any other man considers that he has or seems to have reason to rely on the flesh and his physical and outward advantages , I have still more !
AMPC	Philippians	3	5	Circumcised when I was eight days old , of the race of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew [ and the son ] of Hebrews ; as to the observance of the Law I was of [ the party of ] the Pharisees ,
AMPC	Philippians	3	6	As to my zeal , I was a persecutor of the church , and by the Law ’ s standard of righteousness ( supposed justice , uprightness , and right standing with God ) I was proven to be blameless and no fault was found with me .
AMPC	Philippians	3	7	But whatever former things I had that might have been gains to me , I have come to consider as [ [ a ] one combined ] loss for Christ ’ s sake .
AMPC	Philippians	3	8	Yes , furthermore , I count everything as loss compared to the possession of the priceless privilege ( the overwhelming preciousness , the surpassing worth , and supreme advantage ) of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and of progressively becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him [ of perceiving and recognizing and understanding Him more fully and clearly ] . For His sake I have lost everything and consider it all to be mere rubbish ( refuse , dregs ) , in order that I may win ( gain ) Christ ( the Anointed One ) ,
AMPC	Philippians	3	9	And that I may [ actually ] be found and known as in Him , not having any [ self-achieved ] righteousness that can be called my own , based on my obedience to the Law ’ s demands ( ritualistic uprightness and supposed right standing with God thus acquired ) , but possessing that [ genuine righteousness ] which comes through faith in Christ ( the Anointed One ) , the [ truly ] right standing with God , which comes from God by [ saving ] faith .
AMPC	Philippians	3	10	[ For my determined purpose is ] that I may know Him [ that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him , perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly and more clearly ] , and that I may in that same way come to know the power outflowing from His resurrection [ [ b ] which it exerts over believers ] , and that I may so share His sufferings as to be continually transformed [ in spirit into His likeness even ] to His death , [ in the hope ]
AMPC	Philippians	3	11	That if possible I may attain to the [ [ c ] spiritual and moral ] resurrection [ that lifts me ] out from among the dead [ even while in the body ] .
AMPC	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have now attained [ this ideal ] , or have already been made perfect , but I press on to lay hold of ( grasp ) and make my own , that for which Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) has laid hold of me and made me His own .
AMPC	Philippians	3	13	I do not consider , brethren , that I have captured and made it my own [ yet ] ; but one thing I do [ it is my one aspiration ] : forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead ,
AMPC	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal to win the [ supreme and heavenly ] prize to which God in Christ Jesus is calling us upward .
AMPC	Philippians	3	15	So let those [ of us ] who are spiritually mature and full-grown have this mind and hold these convictions ; and if in any respect you have a different attitude of mind , God will make that clear to you also .
AMPC	Philippians	3	16	Only let us hold true to what we have already attained and walk and order our lives by that .
AMPC	Philippians	3	17	Brethren , together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you .
AMPC	Philippians	3	18	For there are many , of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears , who walk ( live ) as enemies of the cross of Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Philippians	3	19	They are doomed and their [ d ] fate is eternal misery ( perdition ) ; their god is their stomach ( their appetites , their sensuality ) and they glory in their shame , [ e ] siding with earthly things and being of their party .
AMPC	Philippians	3	20	But we are citizens of the state ( commonwealth , homeland ) which is in heaven , and from it also we [ f ] earnestly and patiently await [ the coming of ] the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) [ as ] Savior ,
AMPC	Philippians	3	21	Who will [ g ] transform and fashion anew the body of our humiliation to conform to and be like the body of His glory and majesty , by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself .

AMPC	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always [ delight , gladden yourselves in Him ] ; again I say , Rejoice ! ( A )
AMPC	Philippians	4	2	I entreat and advise Euodia and I entreat and advise Syntyche to agree and to work in harmony in the Lord .
AMPC	Philippians	4	3	And I exhort you too , [ my ] genuine yokefellow , help these [ two women to keep on cooperating ] , for they have toiled along with me in [ the spreading of ] the good news ( the Gospel ) , as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the Book of Life .
AMPC	Philippians	4	5	Let all men know and perceive and recognize your unselfishness ( your considerateness , your forbearing spirit ) . The Lord is near [ He is [ a ] coming soon ] .
AMPC	Philippians	4	6	Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything , but in every circumstance and in everything , by prayer and petition ( [ b ] definite requests ) , with thanksgiving , continue to make your wants known to God .
AMPC	Philippians	4	7	And God ’ s peace [ shall be yours , that [ c ] tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ , and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is , that peace ] which transcends all understanding shall [ d ] garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	Philippians	4	8	For the rest , brethren , whatever is true , whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly , whatever is just , whatever is pure , whatever is lovely and lovable , whatever is kind and winsome and gracious , if there is any virtue and excellence , if there is anything worthy of praise , think on and weigh and take account of these things [ fix your minds on them ] .
AMPC	Philippians	4	9	Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me , and model your way of living on it , and the God of peace ( of [ e ] untroubled , undisturbed well-being ) will be with you .
AMPC	Philippians	4	10	I was made very happy in the Lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time ; you were indeed thinking of me , but you had no opportunity to show it .
AMPC	Philippians	4	11	Not that I am implying that I was in any personal want , for I have learned how to be [ f ] content ( satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or disquieted ) in whatever state I am .
AMPC	Philippians	4	12	I know how to be abased and live humbly in straitened circumstances , and I know also how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance . I have learned in any and all circumstances the secret of facing every situation , whether well-fed or going hungry , having a sufficiency and enough to spare or going without and being in want .
AMPC	Philippians	4	13	I have strength for all things in Christ Who empowers me [ I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who [ g ] infuses inner strength into me ; I am [ h ] self-sufficient in Christ ’ s sufficiency ] .
AMPC	Philippians	4	14	But it was right and commendable and noble of you to contribute for my needs and to share my difficulties with me .
AMPC	Philippians	4	15	And you Philippians yourselves well know that in the early days of the Gospel ministry , when I left Macedonia , no church ( assembly ) entered into partnership with me and opened up [ a debit and credit ] account in giving and receiving except you only .
AMPC	Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica you sent [ me contributions ] for my needs , not only once but a second time .
AMPC	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek or am eager for [ your ] gift , but I do seek and am eager for the fruit which increases to your credit [ the harvest of blessing that is accumulating to your account ] .
AMPC	Philippians	4	18	But I have [ your full payment ] and more ; I have everything I need and am amply supplied , now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me . [ They are the ] fragrant odor of an offering and sacrifice which God welcomes and in which He delights .
AMPC	Philippians	4	19	And my God will liberally supply ( [ i ] fill to the full ) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	Philippians	4	20	To our God and Father be glory forever and ever ( through the endless eternities of the eternities ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	Philippians	4	21	Remember me to every saint ( every born-again believer ) in Christ Jesus . The brethren ( my [ j ] associates ) who are with me greet you .
AMPC	Philippians	4	22	All the saints ( God ’ s consecrated ones here ) wish to be remembered to you , especially those of Caesar ’ s household .
AMPC	Philippians	4	23	The grace ( spiritual favor and blessing ) of the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) be with your spirit . Amen ( so be it ) .

AMPC	Colossians	1	1	Paul , an apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) , by the will of God , and Timothy [ our ] brother ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	2	To the saints ( the consecrated people of God ) and [ a ] believing and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colossae : Grace ( spiritual favor and blessing ) to you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father .
AMPC	Colossians	1	3	We [ b ] continually give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , as we are praying for you ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	4	For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [ [ c ] the leaning of your entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] and of the love which you [ have and show ] for all the saints ( God ’ s consecrated ones ) ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	5	Because of the hope [ of experiencing what is ] laid up ( [ d ] reserved and waiting ) for you in heaven . Of this [ hope ] you heard in the past in the message of the truth of the Gospel ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	6	Which has come to you . Indeed , in the whole world [ that Gospel ] is bearing fruit and still is growing [ e ] [ by its own inherent power ] , even as it has done among yourselves ever since the day you first heard and came to know and understand the grace of God in truth . [ You came to know the grace or undeserved favor of God in reality , deeply and clearly and thoroughly , becoming accurately and intimately acquainted with it . ]
AMPC	Colossians	1	7	You so learned it from Epaphras , our beloved fellow servant . He is a faithful minister of Christ in our stead and as our representative and [ f ] yours .
AMPC	Colossians	1	8	Also he has informed us of your love in the [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMPC	Colossians	1	9	For this reason we also , from the day we heard of it , have not ceased to pray and make [ [ g ] special ] request for you , [ asking ] that you may be filled with the [ h ] full ( deep and clear ) knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [ [ i ] in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ] and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things—
AMPC	Colossians	1	10	That you may walk ( live and conduct yourselves ) in a manner worthy of the Lord , fully pleasing to Him and [ j ] desiring to please Him in all things , bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of God [ with fuller , deeper , and clearer insight , [ k ] acquaintance , and recognition ] .
AMPC	Colossians	1	11	[ We pray ] that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of His glory , [ to exercise ] every kind of endurance and patience ( perseverance and forbearance ) with joy ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	12	Giving thanks to the Father , Who has qualified and made us fit to share the [ l ] portion which is the inheritance of the saints ( God ’ s holy people ) in the Light .
AMPC	Colossians	1	13	[ The Father ] has delivered and [ m ] drawn us to Himself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son [ n ] of His love ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	14	In Whom we have our redemption through His blood , [ which means ] the forgiveness of our sins .
AMPC	Colossians	1	15	[ Now ] He is the [ o ] exact likeness of the unseen God [ the visible representation of the invisible ] ; He is the Firstborn of all creation .
AMPC	Colossians	1	16	For it was in Him that all things were created , in heaven and on earth , things seen and things unseen , whether thrones , dominions , rulers , or authorities ; all things were created and exist through Him [ by His service , intervention ] and in and for Him .
AMPC	Colossians	1	17	And He Himself existed before all things , and in Him all things consist ( cohere , are held together ) . ( A )
AMPC	Colossians	1	18	He also is the Head of [ His ] body , the church ; seeing He is the Beginning , the Firstborn from among the dead , so that He alone in everything and in every respect might occupy the chief place [ stand first and be preeminent ] .
AMPC	Colossians	1	19	For it has pleased [ the Father ] that all the divine fullness ( the sum total of the divine perfection , powers , and attributes ) should dwell in Him [ p ] permanently .
AMPC	Colossians	1	20	And God purposed that through ( [ q ] by the service , the intervention of ) Him [ the Son ] all things should be completely reconciled [ r ] back to Himself , whether on earth or in heaven , as through Him , [ the Father ] made peace by means of the blood of His cross .
AMPC	Colossians	1	21	And although you at one time were estranged and alienated from Him and were of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activities ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	22	Yet now has [ Christ , the Messiah ] reconciled [ you to God ] in the body of His flesh through death , in order to present you holy and faultless and irreproachable in His [ the Father ’ s ] presence .
AMPC	Colossians	1	23	[ And this He will do ] provided that you continue to [ s ] stay with and in the faith [ in Christ ] , well-grounded and settled and steadfast , not shifting or moving away from the hope [ which rests on and is inspired by ] the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) , which you heard and which has been preached [ t ] [ as being designed for and offered without restrictions ] to every person under heaven , and of which [ Gospel ] I , Paul , became a minister .
AMPC	Colossians	1	24	[ Even ] now I rejoice in [ u ] the midst of my sufferings on your behalf . And in my own person I am making up whatever is still lacking and remains to be completed [ [ v ] on our part ] of Christ ’ s afflictions , for the sake of His body , which is the church .
AMPC	Colossians	1	25	In it I became a minister in accordance with the divine [ w ] stewardship which was entrusted to me for you [ as its object and for your benefit ] , to make the Word of God fully known [ among you ] —
AMPC	Colossians	1	26	The mystery of which was hidden for ages and generations [ [ x ] from angels and men ] , but is now revealed to His holy people ( the saints ) ,
AMPC	Colossians	1	27	To whom God was pleased to make known how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery , which is Christ within and among you , the Hope of [ realizing the ] glory .
AMPC	Colossians	1	28	Him we preach and proclaim , warning and admonishing everyone and instructing everyone in all wisdom ( [ y ] comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ) , that we may present every person mature ( full-grown , fully initiated , complete , and perfect ) in Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Colossians	1	29	For this I labor [ [ z ] unto weariness ] , striving with all the [ aa ] superhuman energy which He so mightily enkindles and works within me .

AMPC	Colossians	2	2	[ For my concern is ] that their hearts may be [ b ] braced ( comforted , cheered , and encouraged ) as they are knit together in love , that they may come to have all the abounding wealth and blessings of assured conviction of understanding , and that they may become progressively [ c ] more intimately acquainted with and may know more definitely and accurately and thoroughly that mystic secret of God , [ which is ] Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Colossians	2	3	In Him all the treasures of [ divine ] wisdom ( [ d ] comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God ) and [ all the riches of spiritual ] knowledge and enlightenment are stored up and lie hidden .
AMPC	Colossians	2	4	I say this in order that no one may mislead and delude you by plausible and persuasive and attractive arguments and beguiling speech .
AMPC	Colossians	2	5	For though I am away from you in body , yet I am with you in spirit , delighted at the sight of your [ standing shoulder to shoulder in such ] orderly array and the firmness and the solid front and steadfastness of your faith in Christ [ that [ e ] leaning of the entire human personality on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] .
AMPC	Colossians	2	6	As you have therefore received Christ , [ even ] Jesus the Lord , [ so ] walk ( regulate your lives and conduct yourselves ) in union with and conformity to Him .
AMPC	Colossians	2	7	Have the roots [ of your being ] firmly and deeply planted [ in Him , fixed and founded in Him ] , being continually built up in Him , becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith , just as you were taught , and abounding and overflowing in it with thanksgiving .
AMPC	Colossians	2	8	See to it that no one carries you off as spoil or makes you yourselves captive by his so-called philosophy and intellectualism and vain deceit ( idle fancies and plain nonsense ) , following human tradition ( men ’ s ideas of the material rather than the spiritual world ) , just crude notions following the rudimentary and elemental teachings of the universe and disregarding [ the teachings of ] Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Colossians	2	9	For in Him the whole fullness of Deity ( the Godhead ) continues to dwell in bodily form [ giving complete expression of the divine nature ] .
AMPC	Colossians	2	10	And you [ f ] are in Him , made full and having come to fullness of life [ in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead—Father , Son and Holy Spirit—and reach full spiritual stature ] . And He is the Head of all rule and authority [ of every angelic principality and power ] .
AMPC	Colossians	2	11	In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , but in a [ spiritual ] circumcision [ performed by ] Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh ( the whole corrupt , carnal nature with its passions and lusts ) .
AMPC	Colossians	2	12	[ Thus [ g ] you were circumcised when ] you were buried with Him in [ your ] baptism , in which you were also raised with Him [ [ h ] to a new life ] through [ your ] faith in the working of God [ [ i ] as displayed ] when He raised Him up from the dead .
AMPC	Colossians	2	13	And you who were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh ( your sensuality , your sinful carnal nature ) , [ God ] brought to life together with [ Christ ] , having [ freely ] forgiven us all our transgressions ,
AMPC	Colossians	2	14	Having cancelled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note ( bond ) with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us ( hostile to us ) . This [ note with its regulations , decrees , and demands ] He set aside and cleared [ j ] completely out of our way by nailing it to [ His ] cross .
AMPC	Colossians	2	15	[ God ] disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them , in triumphing over them in Him and in it [ the cross ] .
AMPC	Colossians	2	16	Therefore let no one sit in judgment on you in matters of food and drink , or with regard to a feast day or a New Moon or a Sabbath .
AMPC	Colossians	2	17	Such [ things ] are only the shadow of things that are to come , and they have only a symbolic value . But the reality ( the substance , the solid fact of what is foreshadowed , the body of it ) belongs to Christ .
AMPC	Colossians	2	18	Let no one defraud you by acting as an umpire and declaring you unworthy and disqualifying you for the prize , insisting on self-abasement and worship of angels , taking his stand on visions [ he claims ] he has seen , vainly puffed up by his sensuous notions and inflated by his unspiritual thoughts and fleshly conceit ,
AMPC	Colossians	2	19	And not holding fast to the Head , from Whom the entire body , supplied and knit together by means of its joints and ligaments , grows with a growth that is from God .
AMPC	Colossians	2	20	If then you have died with Christ to material ways of looking at things and have escaped from the world ’ s crude and elemental notions and teachings of externalism , why do you live as if you still belong to the world ? [ Why do you submit to rules and regulations ? —such as ]
AMPC	Colossians	2	21	Do not handle [ this ] , Do not taste [ that ] , Do not even touch [ them ] ,
AMPC	Colossians	2	22	Referring to things all of which perish with being used . To do this is to follow human precepts and doctrines . ( A )
AMPC	Colossians	2	23	Such [ practices ] have indeed the outward appearance [ that popularly passes ] for wisdom , in promoting self-imposed rigor of devotion and delight in self-humiliation and severity of discipline of the body , but they are of no value in checking the indulgence of the flesh ( the lower nature ) . [ Instead , they do not honor God but serve only to indulge the flesh . ] Footnotes - Colossians 2:1 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Colossians 2:2 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Colossians 2:2 Richard Trench , Synonyms of the New Testament . - Colossians 2:3 Alexander Souter , Pocket Lexicon . - Colossians 2:5 Alexander Souter , Pocket Lexicon . - Colossians 2:10 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Colossians 2:12 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies : “ The aorist tense puts the burial as contemporaneous with the circumcision. ” - Colossians 2:12 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Colossians 2:12 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Colossians 2:14 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies .

AMPC	Colossians	3	3	For [ as far as this world is concerned ] you have died , and your [ new , real ] life is hidden with Christ in God .
AMPC	Colossians	3	2	And set your minds and keep them set on what is above ( the higher things ) , not on the things that are on the earth .
AMPC	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , Who is our life , appears , then you also will appear with Him in [ the splendor of His ] glory .
AMPC	Colossians	3	5	So kill ( deaden , [ a ] deprive of power ) the evil desire lurking in your members [ those animal impulses and all that is earthly in you that is employed in sin ] : sexual vice , impurity , sensual appetites , unholy desires , and all greed and covetousness , for that is idolatry ( the deifying of self and other created things instead of God ) .
AMPC	Colossians	3	6	It is on account of these [ very sins ] that the [ holy ] anger of God is ever coming upon the sons of disobedience ( those who are obstinately opposed to the divine will ) ,
AMPC	Colossians	3	7	Among whom you also once walked , when you were living in and addicted to [ such practices ] .
AMPC	Colossians	3	8	But now put away and rid yourselves [ completely ] of all these things : anger , rage , bad feeling toward others , curses and slander , and foulmouthed abuse and shameful utterances from your lips !
AMPC	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie to one another , for you have stripped off the old ( unregenerate ) self with its evil practices ,
AMPC	Colossians	3	10	And have clothed yourselves with the new [ spiritual self ] , which is [ ever in the process of being ] renewed and remolded into [ fuller and more perfect [ b ] knowledge upon ] knowledge after the image ( the likeness ) of Him Who created it . ( B )
AMPC	Colossians	3	11	[ In this new creation all distinctions vanish . ] There [ c ] is no room for and there can be neither Greek nor Jew , circumcised nor uncircumcised , [ nor difference between nations whether alien ] barbarians or Scythians [ [ d ] who are the most savage of all ] , nor slave or free man ; but Christ is all and in all [ [ e ] everything and everywhere , to all men , without distinction of person ] .
AMPC	Colossians	3	12	Clothe yourselves therefore , as God ’ s own chosen ones ( His own picked representatives ) , [ who are ] purified and holy and well-beloved [ by God Himself , by putting on behavior marked by ] tenderhearted pity and mercy , kind feeling , a lowly opinion of yourselves , gentle ways , [ and ] patience [ which is tireless and long-suffering , and has the power to endure whatever comes , with good temper ] .
AMPC	Colossians	3	13	Be gentle and forbearing with one another and , if one has a difference ( a grievance or complaint ) against another , readily pardoning each other ; even as the Lord has [ freely ] forgiven you , so must you also [ forgive ] .
AMPC	Colossians	3	14	And above all these [ put on ] love and enfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness [ which binds everything together completely in ideal harmony ] .
AMPC	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace ( soul harmony which comes ) from Christ rule ( act as umpire continually ) in your hearts [ deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds , in that peaceful state ] to which as [ members of Christ ’ s ] one body you were also called [ to live ] . And be thankful ( appreciative ) , [ giving praise to God always ] .
AMPC	Colossians	3	16	Let the word [ spoken by ] Christ ( the Messiah ) have its home [ in your hearts and minds ] and dwell in you in [ all its ] richness , as you teach and admonish and train one another in all insight and intelligence and wisdom [ in spiritual things , and as you sing ] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , making melody to God with [ His ] grace in your hearts .
AMPC	Colossians	3	17	And whatever you do [ no matter what it is ] in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus and in [ dependence upon ] His Person , giving praise to God the Father through Him .
AMPC	Colossians	3	18	Wives , be subject to your husbands [ subordinate and adapt yourselves to them ] , as is right and fitting and your proper duty in the Lord .
AMPC	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives [ be affectionate and sympathetic with them ] and do not be harsh or bitter or resentful toward them .
AMPC	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in everything , for this is pleasing to the Lord .
AMPC	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , do not provoke or irritate or fret your children [ do not be hard on them or harass them ] , lest they become discouraged and sullen and morose and feel inferior and frustrated . [ Do not break their spirit . ]
AMPC	Colossians	3	22	Servants , obey in everything those who are your earthly masters , not only when their eyes are on you as pleasers of men , but in simplicity of purpose [ with all your heart ] because of your reverence for the Lord and as a sincere expression of your devotion to Him .
AMPC	Colossians	3	23	Whatever may be your task , work at it heartily ( from the soul ) , as [ something done ] for the Lord and not for men ,
AMPC	Colossians	3	24	Knowing [ with all certainty ] that it is from the Lord [ and not from men ] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [ real ] reward . [ The One Whom ] you are actually serving [ is ] the Lord Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Colossians	3	25	For he who deals wrongfully will [ reap the fruit of his folly and ] be punished for his wrongdoing . And [ with God ] there is no partiality [ no matter what a person ’ s position may be , whether he is the slave or the master ] .

AMPC	Colossians	4	4	That I may proclaim it fully and make it clear [ speak boldly and unfold that mystery ] , as is my duty .
AMPC	Colossians	4	2	Be earnest and unwearied and steadfast in your prayer [ life ] , being [ both ] alert and intent in [ your praying ] with thanksgiving .
AMPC	Colossians	4	3	And at the same time pray for us also , that God may open a door to us for the Word ( the Gospel ) , to proclaim the mystery concerning Christ ( the Messiah ) on account of which I am in prison ;
AMPC	Colossians	4	5	Behave yourselves wisely [ living prudently and with discretion ] in your relations with those of the outside world ( the non-Christians ) , making the very most of the time and seizing ( buying up ) the opportunity .
AMPC	Colossians	4	6	Let your speech at all times be gracious ( pleasant and winsome ) , seasoned [ as it were ] with salt , [ so that you may never be at a loss ] to know how you ought to answer anyone [ who puts a question to you ] .
AMPC	Colossians	4	7	Tychicus will give you full information about my affairs ; [ he is ] a much-loved brother and faithful ministering assistant and fellow servant [ with us ] in the Lord .
AMPC	Colossians	4	8	I have sent him to you for this very purpose , that you may know how we are faring and that he may comfort and cheer and encourage your hearts .
AMPC	Colossians	4	9	And with [ him is ] Onesimus , [ our ] faithful and beloved brother , who is [ one ] of yourselves . They will let you know everything that has taken place here [ in Rome ] .
AMPC	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus my fellow prisoner wishes to be remembered to you , as does Mark the relative of Barnabas . You received instructions concerning him ; if he comes to you give him a [ [ a ] hearty ] welcome .
AMPC	Colossians	4	11	And [ greetings also from ] Jesus , who is called Justus . These [ Hebrew Christians ] alone of the circumcision are among my fellow workers for [ the extension of ] God ’ s kingdom , and they have proved a relief and a comfort to me .
AMPC	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras , who is one of yourselves , a servant of Christ Jesus , sends you greetings . [ He is ] always striving for you earnestly in his prayers , [ pleading ] that you may [ as persons of ripe character and clear conviction ] stand firm and mature [ in spiritual growth ] , convinced and fully assured in [ b ] everything willed by God .
AMPC	Colossians	4	13	For I bear him testimony that he has labored hard in your behalf and for [ the believers ] in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis .
AMPC	Colossians	4	14	Luke the beloved physician and Demas salute you .
AMPC	Colossians	4	15	Give my greetings to the brethren at Laodicea , and to Nympha and the assembly ( the church ) which meets in her house .
AMPC	Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle has been read before you , [ see ] that it is read also in the assembly ( the church ) of the Laodiceans , and also [ see ] that you yourselves in turn read the [ letter that comes to you ] from Laodicea .
AMPC	Colossians	4	17	And say to Archippus , See that you discharge carefully [ the duties of ] the ministry and fulfill the stewardship which you have received in the Lord .
AMPC	Colossians	4	18	I , Paul , [ add this final ] greeting , writing with my own hand . Remember I am still in prison and in chains . May grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor and blessing ) be with you ! Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes - Colossians 4:10 Charles B.

AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We are ever giving thanks to God for all of you , continually mentioning [ you when engaged ] in our prayers ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	Recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith and service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [ the return of ] our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	[ O ] brethren beloved by God , we recognize and know that He has selected ( chosen ) you ;
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	For our [ preaching of the ] glad tidings ( the Gospel ) came to you not only in word , but also in [ its own inherent ] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction and absolute certainty [ on our part ] . You know what kind of men we proved [ ourselves ] to be among you for your good .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And you [ set yourselves to ] become imitators of us and [ through us ] of the Lord Himself , for you welcomed our message in [ spite of ] much persecution , with joy [ inspired ] by the Holy Spirit ;
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	So that you [ thus ] became a pattern to all the believers ( those who adhere to , trust in , and rely on Christ Jesus ) in Macedonia and Achaia ( most of Greece ) .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For not only has the Word concerning and from the Lord resounded forth from you unmistakably in Macedonia and Achaia , but everywhere the report has gone forth of your faith in God [ of your [ a ] leaning of your whole personality on Him in complete trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] . So we [ find that we ] never need to tell people anything [ further about it ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves volunteer testimony concerning us , telling what an entrance we had among you , and how you turned to God from [ your ] idols to serve a God Who is alive and true and genuine ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	And [ how you ] look forward to and await the coming of His Son from heaven , Whom He raised from the dead—Jesus , Who personally rescues and delivers us out of and from the wrath [ bringing punishment ] which is coming [ upon the impenitent ] and [ b ] draws us to Himself [ [ c ] investing us with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in Christ , the Messiah ] .

AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But though we had already suffered and been outrageously treated at Philippi , as you know , yet in [ the strength of ] our God we summoned courage to proclaim to you unfalteringly the good news ( the Gospel ) with earnest contention and much conflict and great opposition .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our appeal [ in preaching ] does not [ originate ] from delusion or error or impure purpose or motive , nor in fraud or deceit .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) , so we speak not to please men but to please God , Who tests our hearts [ [ a ] expecting them to be approved ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For as you well know , we never resorted either to words of flattery or to any cloak to conceal greedy motives or pretexts for gain , [ as ] God is our witness .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	Nor did we seek to extract praise and honor and glory from men , either from you or from anyone else , though we might have asserted our authority [ stood on our dignity and claimed honor ] as apostles ( special missionaries ) of Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But we behaved gently when we were among you , like a devoted mother nursing and cherishing her own children .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	So , being thus tenderly and affectionately desirous of you , we continued to share with you not only God ’ s good news ( the Gospel ) but also our own lives as well , for you had become so very dear to us .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For you recall our hard toil and struggles , brethren . We worked night and day [ and plied our trade ] in order not to be a burden to any of you [ for our support ] while we proclaimed the glad tidings ( the Gospel ) of God to you .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses , [ yes ] and God [ also ] , how unworldly and upright and blameless was our behavior toward you believers [ who adhered to and trusted in and relied on our Lord Jesus Christ ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	For you know how , as a father [ dealing with ] his children , we used to exhort each of you personally , stimulating and encouraging and charging you
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	To live lives worthy of God , Who calls you into His own kingdom and the glorious blessedness [ [ b ] into which true believers will enter after Christ ’ s return ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	And we also [ especially ] thank God continually for this , that when you received the message of God [ which you heard ] from us , you welcomed it not as the word of [ mere ] men , but as it truly is , the Word of God , which is effectually at work in you who believe [ [ c ] exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you , brethren , became imitators of the assemblies ( churches ) of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea , for you too have suffered the same kind of treatment from your own fellow countrymen as they did [ who were persecuted at the hands ] of the Jews ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	Who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and harassed and drove us out , and continue to make themselves hateful and offensive to God and to show themselves foes of all men ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	Forbidding and hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles ( the nations ) that they may be saved . So as always they fill up [ to the brim the measure of ] their sins . But God ’ s wrath has come upon them at last [ completely and forever ] ! ( A )
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But since we were bereft of you , brethren , for a little while in person , [ of course ] not in heart , we endeavored the more eagerly and with great longing to see you face to face ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	Because it was our will to come to you . [ I mean that ] I , Paul , again and again [ wanted to come ] , but Satan hindered and impeded us .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope or happiness or our victor ’ s wreath of exultant triumph when we stand in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming ? Is it not you ?
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	For you are [ indeed ] our glory and our joy ! Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	That no one [ of you ] should be disturbed and beguiled and led astray by these afflictions and difficulties [ to which I have referred ] . For you yourselves know that this is [ unavoidable in our position , and must be recognized as ] our appointed lot .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	And we sent Timothy , our brother and God ’ s servant in [ spreading ] the good news ( the Gospel ) of Christ , to strengthen and establish and to exhort and comfort and encourage you in your faith ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	For even when we were with you , [ you know ] we warned you plainly beforehand that we were to be pressed with difficulties and made to suffer affliction , just as to your own knowledge it has [ since ] happened .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	That is the reason that , when I could bear [ the suspense ] no longer , I sent that I might learn [ how you were standing the strain , and the endurance of ] your faith , [ for I was fearful ] lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our toil [ among you should prove to ] be fruitless and to no purpose .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now that Timothy has just come back to us from [ his visit to ] you and has brought us the good news of [ the steadfastness of ] your faith and [ the warmth of your ] love , and [ reported ] how kindly you cherish a constant and affectionate remembrance of us [ and that you are ] longing to see us as we [ are to see ] you ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	Brethren , for this reason , in [ spite of all ] our stress and crushing difficulties we have been filled with comfort and cheer about you [ because of ] your faith ( [ a ] the leaning of your whole personality on God in complete trust and confidence ) .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	Because now we [ really ] live , if you stand [ firm ] in the Lord .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	For what [ adequate ] thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the gladness and delight which we enjoy for your sakes before our God ?
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	[ And we ] continue to pray especially and with most intense earnestness night and day that we may see you face to face and mend and make good whatever may be imperfect and lacking in your faith .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) guide our steps to you .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	And may the Lord make you to increase and excel and overflow in love for one another and for all people , just as we also do for you ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	So that He may strengthen and confirm and establish your hearts faultlessly pure and unblamable in holiness in the sight of our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) with all His saints ( the [ b ] holy and glorified people of God ) ! Amen , ( so be it ) ! Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	That each one of you should know how to [ c ] possess ( control , manage ) his own [ d ] body in consecration ( purity , separated from things profane ) and honor ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what charges and precepts we gave you [ [ b ] on the authority and by the inspiration of ] the Lord Jesus .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God , that you should be consecrated ( separated and set apart for pure and holy living ) : that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual vice ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	Not [ to be used ] in the passion of lust like the heathen , who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of His will ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	That no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or defraud his brother in business . For the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as we have already warned you solemnly and [ e ] told you plainly .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [ to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore whoever disregards ( sets aside and rejects this ) disregards not man but God , Whose [ very ] Spirit [ Whom ] He gives to you is holy ( chaste , pure ) .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	But concerning brotherly love [ for all other Christians ] , you have no need to have anyone write you , for you yourselves have been [ personally ] taught by God to love one another .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	And indeed you already are [ extending and displaying your love ] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia . But we beseech and earnestly exhort you , brethren , that you [ f ] excel [ in this matter ] more and more ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	To make it your ambition and definitely endeavor to live quietly and peacefully , to mind your own affairs , and to work with your hands , as we charged you ,
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	So that you may bear yourselves becomingly and be correct and honorable and command the respect of the outside world , being dependent on nobody [ self-supporting ] and having need of nothing .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	Now also we would not have you ignorant , brethren , about those who fall asleep [ [ g ] in death ] , that you may not grieve [ for them ] as the rest do who have no hope [ beyond the grave ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [ [ h ] in death ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For this we declare to you by the Lord ’ s [ own ] word , that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [ into His presence ] or have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [ in Him [ i ] in death ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons , with the shout of an archangel , and with the blast of the trumpet of God . And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	Then we , the living ones who remain [ on the earth ] , shall simultaneously be caught up along with [ the resurrected dead ] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air ; and so always ( through the eternity of the eternities ) we shall be with the Lord !
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	Therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	1	Thessalonians
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	For you are all sons of light and sons of the day ; we do not belong either to the night or to darkness .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [ return of the ] Lord will come [ as unexpectedly and suddenly ] as a thief in the night .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	When people are saying , All is well and secure , and , There is peace and safety , then in a moment unforeseen destruction ( ruin and death ) will come upon them as suddenly as labor pains come upon a woman with child ; and they shall by no means escape , for there will be no escape .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But you are not in [ given up to the power of ] darkness , brethren , for that day to overtake you by surprise like a thief .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	Accordingly then , let us not sleep , as the rest do , but let us keep wide awake ( alert , watchful , cautious , and on our guard ) and let us be sober ( calm , collected , and circumspect ) .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For those who sleep , sleep at night , and those who are drunk , get drunk at night .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But we belong to the day ; therefore , let us be sober and put on the breastplate ( corslet ) of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	For God has not appointed us to [ incur His ] wrath [ He did not select us to condemn us ] , but [ that we might ] obtain [ His ] salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah )
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us so that whether we are still alive or are dead [ at Christ ’ s appearing ] , we might live together with Him and share His life .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	Therefore encourage ( admonish , exhort ) one another and edify ( strengthen and build up ) one another , just as you are doing .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	Now also we beseech you , brethren , get to know those who labor among you [ recognize them for what they are , acknowledge and appreciate and respect them all ] —your leaders who are over you in the Lord and those who warn and kindly reprove and exhort you .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	And hold them in very high and most affectionate esteem in [ intelligent and sympathetic ] appreciation of their work . Be at peace among yourselves .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	And we earnestly beseech you , brethren , admonish ( warn and seriously advise ) those who are out of line [ the loafers , the disorderly , and the unruly ] ; encourage the timid and fainthearted , help and give your support to the weak souls , [ and ] be very patient with everybody [ always keeping your temper ] . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	See that none of you repays another with evil for evil , but always aim to show kindness and seek to do good to one another and to everybody .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	Be happy [ in your faith ] and rejoice and be glad-hearted continually ( always ) ;
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	Be unceasing in prayer [ praying perseveringly ] ;
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	Thank [ God ] in everything [ no matter what the circumstances may be , be thankful and give thanks ] , for this is the will of God for you [ who are ] in Christ Jesus [ the Revealer and Mediator of that will ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	Do not quench ( suppress or subdue ) the [ Holy ] Spirit ;
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	Do not spurn the gifts and utterances of the prophets [ do not depreciate prophetic revelations nor despise inspired instruction or exhortation or warning ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	But test and prove all things [ until you can recognize ] what is good ; [ to that ] hold fast .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from evil [ shrink from it and keep aloof from it ] in whatever form or whatever kind it may be .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [ separate you from profane things , make you pure and wholly consecrated to God ] ; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete [ and found ] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is He Who is calling you [ to Himself ] and utterly trustworthy , and He will also do it [ fulfill His call by hallowing and keeping you ] .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren , pray for us .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with a sacred kiss .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	I solemnly charge you [ in the name of ] the Lord to have this letter read before all the brethren .
AMPC	1%20Thessalonians	5	28	The grace ( the unmerited favor and blessings ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you all . Amen , ( so be it ) . Copyright ©

AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , Silvanus ( Silas ) , and Timothy , to the church ( assembly ) of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) :
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought and indeed are obligated [ as those in debt ] to give thanks always to God for you , brethren , as is fitting , because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each toward the others is increasing and abounds .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	And this is a cause of our mentioning you with pride among the churches ( assemblies ) of God for your steadfastness ( your unflinching endurance and patience ) and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecutions and crushing distresses and afflictions under which you are holding up .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is positive proof of the just and right judgment of God to the end that you may be deemed deserving of His kingdom [ a plain token of His fair verdict which designs that you should be made and counted worthy of the kingdom of God ] , for the sake of which you are also suffering .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	[ It is a fair decision ] since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with distress and affliction those who distress and afflict you ,
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	And to [ [ a ] recompense ] you who are so distressed and afflicted [ by granting you ] relief and rest along with us [ your fellow sufferers ] when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire ,
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	To deal out retribution ( chastisement and vengeance ) upon those who do not know or perceive or become acquainted with God , and [ upon those ] who ignore and refuse to obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	Such people will pay the penalty and suffer the punishment of everlasting ruin ( destruction and perdition ) and eternal exclusion and banishment from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power ,
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	When He comes to be glorified in His saints [ on that day He will be made more glorious in His consecrated people ] , and [ He will ] be marveled at and admired [ in His glory reflected ] in all who have believed [ who have adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Him ] , because our witnessing among you was confidently accepted and believed [ and confirmed in your lives ] .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	With this in view we constantly pray for you , that our God may deem and count you worthy of [ your ] calling and [ His ] every gracious purpose of goodness , and with power may complete in [ your ] every particular work of faith ( faith which is that [ b ] leaning of the whole human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	Thus may the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified and become more glorious through and in you , and may you [ also be glorified ] in Him according to the grace ( favor and blessing ) of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .

AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way , for that day will not come except the [ a ] apostasy comes first [ unless the predicted great [ b ] falling away of those who have professed to be Christians has come ] , and the man of lawlessness ( sin ) is revealed , who is the son of doom ( of perdition ) , ( A )
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposes and exalts himself so proudly and insolently against and over all that is called God or that is worshiped , [ even to his actually ] taking his seat in the temple of God , proclaiming that he himself is God . ( B )
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not recollect that when I was still with you , I told you these things ?
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what is restraining him [ from being revealed at this time ] ; it is so that he may be manifested ( revealed ) in his own [ appointed ] time .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness ( that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority ) is already at work in the world , [ but it is ] restrained only until [ c ] he who restrains is taken out of the way .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then the lawless one ( the antichrist ) will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by His appearing at His coming . ( C )
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	The coming [ of the lawless one , the antichrist ] is through the activity and working of Satan and will be attended by great power and with all sorts of [ pretended ] miracles and signs and delusive marvels— [ all of them ] lying wonders—
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	And by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing ( going to perdition ) because they did not welcome the Truth but refused to love it that they might be saved .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	Therefore God sends upon them a misleading influence , a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false ,
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	In order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in [ who refused to adhere to , trust in , and rely on ] the Truth , but [ instead ] took pleasure in unrighteousness .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we , brethren beloved by the Lord , ought and are obligated [ as those who are in debt ] to give thanks always to God for you , because God chose you from the beginning [ d ] as His firstfruits ( first converts ) for salvation through the sanctifying work of the [ Holy ] Spirit and [ your ] belief in ( adherence to , trust in , and reliance on ) the Truth .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	[ It was ] to this end that He called you through our Gospel , so that you may obtain and share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So then , brethren , stand firm and hold fast to the traditions and instructions which you were taught by us , whether by our word of mouth or by letter .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father , Who loved us and gave us everlasting consolation and encouragement and well-founded hope through [ His ] grace ( unmerited favor ) ,
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	Comfort and encourage your hearts and strengthen them [ make them steadfast and keep them unswerving ] in every good work and word . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	Yet the Lord is faithful , and He will strengthen [ you ] and set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [ one ] .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest and with which we charge you .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into [ realizing and showing ] the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ and [ a ] in waiting for His return .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now we charge you , brethren , in the name and on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) that you withdraw and keep away from every brother ( fellow believer ) who is slack in the performance of duty and is disorderly , living as a shirker and not walking in accord with the traditions and instructions that you have received from us .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example , for we were not disorderly or shirking of duty when we were with you [ we were not idle ] .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	Nor did we eat anyone ’ s bread without paying for it , but with toil and struggle we worked night and day , that we might not be a burden or impose on any of you [ for our support ] .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	[ It was ] not because we do not have a right [ to such support ] , but [ we wished ] to make ourselves an example for you to follow .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For while we were yet with you , we gave you this rule and charge : If anyone will not work , neither let him eat .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	Indeed , we hear that some among you are disorderly [ that they are passing their lives in idleness , neglectful of duty ] , being busy with other people ’ s affairs instead of their own and doing no work .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now we charge and exhort such persons [ as [ b ] ministers in Him exhorting those ] in the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) that they work in quietness and earn their own food and other necessities .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	And as for you , brethren , do not become weary or lose heart in doing right [ but continue in well-doing without weakening ] .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	But if anyone [ in the church ] refuses to obey what we say in this letter , take note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he may be ashamed .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	Do not regard him as an enemy , but simply admonish and warn him as [ being still ] a brother .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace ( the peace of His kingdom ) at all times and in all ways [ under all circumstances and conditions , whatever comes ] . The Lord [ be ] with you all .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	I , Paul , write you this final greeting with my own hand . This is the mark and sign [ that it is not a forgery ] in every letter of mine . It is the way I write [ my handwriting and signature ] .
AMPC	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace ( spiritual blessing and favor ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia , stay on where you are at Ephesus in order that you may warn and admonish and charge certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	4	Nor to give importance to or occupy themselves with legends ( fables , myths ) and endless genealogies , which foster and promote useless speculations and questionings rather than acceptance in faith of God ’ s administration and the divine training that is in faith ( [ a ] in that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence ) —
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	5	Whereas the object and purpose of our instruction and charge is love , which springs from a pure heart and a good ( clear ) conscience and sincere ( unfeigned ) faith .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	6	But certain individuals have missed the mark on this very matter [ and ] have wandered away into vain arguments and discussions and purposeless talk .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	7	They are ambitious to be doctors of the Law ( teachers of the Mosaic ritual ) , but they have no understanding either of the words and terms they use or of the subjects about which they make [ such ] dogmatic assertions .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	8	Now we recognize and know that the Law is good if anyone uses it lawfully [ for the purpose for which it was designed ] ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	9	Knowing and understanding this : that the Law is not enacted for the righteous ( the upright and just , who are in right standing with God ) , but for the lawless and unruly , for the ungodly and sinful , for the irreverent and profane , for those who strike and beat and [ even ] murder fathers and strike and beat and [ even ] murder mothers , for manslayers ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	10	[ For ] impure and immoral persons , those who abuse themselves with men , kidnapers , liars , perjurers—and whatever else is opposed to wholesome teaching and sound doctrine
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	11	As laid down by the glorious Gospel of the blessed God , with which I have been entrusted .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	12	I give thanks to Him Who has granted me [ the needed ] strength and made me able [ for this ] , Christ Jesus our Lord , because He has judged and counted me faithful and trustworthy , appointing me to [ this stewardship of ] the ministry .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	13	Though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and was shamefully and outrageously and aggressively insulting [ to Him ] , nevertheless , I obtained mercy because I had acted out of ignorance in unbelief .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	14	And the grace ( unmerited favor and blessing ) of our Lord [ actually ] flowed out superabundantly and beyond measure for me , accompanied by faith and love that are [ to be realized ] in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	15	The saying is sure and true and worthy of full and universal acceptance , that Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) came into the world to save sinners , of whom I am foremost .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	16	But I obtained mercy for the reason that in me , as the foremost [ of sinners ] , Jesus Christ might show forth and display all His perfect long-suffering and patience for an example to [ encourage ] those who would thereafter believe on Him for [ the gaining of ] eternal life .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the King of eternity , incorruptible and immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever ( to the ages of ages ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge and admonition I commit in trust to you , Timothy , my son , [ b ] in accordance with prophetic intimations which I formerly received concerning you , so that inspired and aided by them you may wage the good warfare ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	19	Holding fast to faith ( [ c ] that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence ) and having a good ( clear ) conscience . By rejecting and thrusting from them [ their conscience ] , some individuals have made shipwreck of their faith .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	1	20	Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I have delivered to Satan in order that they may be disciplined [ by punishment and learn ] not to blaspheme . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	2	For kings and all who are in positions of authority or high responsibility , that [ outwardly ] we may pass a quiet and undisturbed life [ and inwardly ] a peaceable one in all godliness and reverence and seriousness in every way .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	3	For such [ praying ] is good and right , and [ it is ] pleasing and acceptable to God our Savior ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	4	Who wishes all men to be saved and [ increasingly ] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [ divine ] Truth .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	5	For there [ is only ] one God , and [ only ] one Mediator between God and men , the Man Christ Jesus ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	6	Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [ people , a fact that was ] attested to at the right and proper time .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	7	And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( special messenger ) —I am speaking the truth in Christ , I do not falsify [ when I say this ] —a teacher of the Gentiles in [ the realm of ] faith and truth .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	8	I desire therefore that in every place men should pray , without anger or quarreling or resentment or doubt [ in their minds ] , lifting up holy hands .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	9	Also [ I desire ] that women should adorn themselves modestly and appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel , not with [ elaborate ] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	10	But by doing good deeds ( deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them ) , as befits women who profess reverential fear for and devotion to God .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let a woman learn in quietness , in entire submissiveness .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	12	I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men ; she is to remain in quietness and keep silence [ in religious assemblies ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed , then Eve ; ( A )
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	14	And it was not Adam who was deceived , but [ the ] woman who was deceived and deluded and fell into transgression . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Timothy	2	15	Nevertheless [ the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls ’ salvation , and ] they will be saved [ eternally ] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control , [ saved indeed ] [ a ] through the Childbearing or by the birth of the divine Child .

AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine , not combative but gentle and considerate , not quarrelsome but forbearing and peaceable , and not a lover of money [ insatiable for wealth and ready to obtain it by questionable means ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	2	Now a bishop ( superintendent , overseer ) must give no grounds for accusation but must be above reproach , the husband of one wife , circumspect and temperate and self-controlled ; [ he must be ] sensible and well behaved and dignified and lead an orderly ( disciplined ) life ; [ he must be ] hospitable [ showing love for and being a friend to the believers , especially strangers or foreigners , and be ] a capable and qualified teacher ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	4	He must rule his own household well , keeping his children under control , with true dignity , commanding their respect in every way and keeping them respectful .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	5	For if a man does not know how to rule his own household , how is he to take care of the church of God ?
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	6	He must not be a new convert , or he may [ develop a beclouded and stupid state of mind ] as the result of pride [ be blinded by conceit , and ] fall into the condemnation that the devil [ once ] did . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	7	Furthermore , he must have a good reputation and be well thought of by those outside [ the church ] , lest he become involved in slander and incur reproach and fall into the devil ’ s trap .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	8	In like manner the deacons [ must be ] worthy of respect , not shifty and double-talkers but sincere in what they say , not given to much wine , not greedy for base gain [ craving wealth and resorting to ignoble and dishonest methods of getting it ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	9	They must possess the mystic secret of the faith [ Christian truth as hidden from ungodly men ] with a clear conscience .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	10	And let them also be tried and investigated and proved first ; then , if they turn out to be above reproach , let them serve [ as deacons ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	11	[ a ] [ The ] women likewise must be worthy of respect and serious , not gossipers , but temperate and self-controlled , [ thoroughly ] trustworthy in all things .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let deacons be the husbands of but one wife , and let them manage [ their ] children and their own households well .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	13	For those who perform well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and also gain much confidence and freedom and boldness in the faith which is [ founded on and centers ] in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	14	Although I hope to come to you before long , I am writing these instructions to you so that ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	15	If I am detained , you may know how people ought to conduct themselves in the household of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and stay ( the prop and support ) of the Truth .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	3	16	And great and important and weighty , we confess , is the hidden truth ( the mystic secret ) of godliness . He [ [ b ] God ] was made visible in human flesh , justified and vindicated in the [ Holy ] Spirit , was seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , [ and ] taken up in glory .

AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	4	For everything God has created is good , and nothing is to be thrown away or refused if it is received with thanksgiving .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	2	Through the hypocrisy and pretensions of liars whose consciences are seared ( cauterized ) ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	3	Who forbid people to marry and [ teach them ] to abstain from [ certain kinds of ] foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and have [ an increasingly clear ] knowledge of the truth .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	5	For it is hallowed and consecrated by the Word of God and by prayer .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	6	If you lay all these instructions before the brethren , you will be a worthy steward and a good minister of Christ Jesus , ever nourishing your own self on the truths of the faith and of the good [ Christian ] instruction which you have closely followed .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	7	But refuse and avoid irreverent legends ( profane and impure and godless fictions , mere grandmothers ’ tales ) and silly myths , and express your disapproval of them . Train yourself toward godliness ( piety ) , [ keeping yourself spiritually fit ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	8	For physical training is of some value ( useful for a little ) , but godliness ( spiritual training ) is useful and of value in everything and in every way , for it holds promise for the present life and also for the life which is to come .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	9	This saying is reliable and worthy of complete acceptance by everybody .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	10	With a view to this we toil and strive , [ yes and ] [ a ] suffer reproach , because we have [ fixed our ] hope on the living God , Who is the Savior ( Preserver , Maintainer , Deliverer ) of all men , especially of those who believe ( trust in , rely on , and adhere to Him ) .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	11	Continue to command these things and to teach them .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	12	Let no one despise or think less of you because of your youth , but be an example ( pattern ) for the believers in speech , in conduct , in love , in faith , and in purity .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	13	Till I come , devote yourself to [ public and private ] reading , to exhortation ( preaching and personal appeals ) , and to teaching and instilling doctrine .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	14	Do not neglect the gift which is in you , [ that special inward endowment ] which was directly imparted to you [ by the Holy Spirit ] by prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon you [ at your ordination ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	15	Practice and cultivate and meditate upon these duties ; throw yourself wholly into them [ as your ministry ] , so that your progress may be evident to everybody .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	4	16	Look well to yourself [ to your own personality ] and to [ your ] teaching ; persevere in these things [ hold to them ] , for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	5	Now [ a woman ] who is a real widow and is left entirely alone and desolate has fixed her hope on God and perseveres in supplications and prayers night and day ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	2	[ Treat ] older women like mothers [ and ] younger women like sisters , in all purity .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	3	[ Always ] treat with great consideration and give aid to those who are truly widowed ( solitary and without support ) .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren , see to it that these are first made to understand that it is their religious duty [ to defray their natural obligation to those ] at home , and make return to their parents or grandparents [ for all their care by contributing to their maintenance ] , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	6	Whereas she who lives in pleasure and self-gratification [ giving herself up to luxury and self-indulgence ] is dead even while she [ still ] lives .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	7	Charge [ the people ] thus , so that they may be without reproach and blameless .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	8	If anyone fails to provide for his relatives , and especially for those of his own family , he has disowned the faith [ by failing to accompany it with fruits ] and is worse than an unbeliever [ who performs his obligation in these matters ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let no one be put on the roll of widows [ who are to receive church support ] who is under sixty years of age or who has been the wife of more than one man ;
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	10	And she must have a reputation for good deeds , as one who has brought up children , who has practiced hospitality to strangers [ of the brotherhood ] , washed the feet of the saints , helped to relieve the distressed , [ and ] devoted herself diligently to doing good in every way .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	11	But refuse [ to enroll on this list the ] younger widows , for when they become restive and their natural desires grow strong , they withdraw themselves against Christ [ and ] wish to marry [ again ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	12	And so they incur condemnation for having set aside and slighted their previous pledge .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	13	Moreover , as they go about from house to house , they learn to be idlers , and not only idlers , but gossips and busybodies , saying what they should not say and talking of things they should not mention .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I would have younger [ widows ] marry , bear children , guide the household , [ and ] not give opponents of the faith occasion for slander or reproach .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	15	For already some [ widows ] have turned aside after Satan .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any believing woman or believing man has [ relatives or persons in the household who are ] widows , let him relieve them ; let the church not be burdened [ with them ] , so that it may [ be free to ] assist those who are truly widows ( those who are all alone and are dependent ) .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered doubly worthy of honor [ and of adequate [ a ] financial support ] , especially those who labor faithfully in preaching and teaching .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the Scripture says , You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain , and again , The laborer is worthy of his hire . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	19	Listen to no accusation [ presented before a judge ] against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	20	As for those who are guilty and persist in sin , rebuke and admonish them in the presence of all , so that the rest may be warned and stand in wholesome awe and fear .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	21	I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the chosen angels that you guard and keep [ these rules ] without personal prejudice or favor , doing nothing from partiality .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	22	Do not be in a hurry in the laying on of hands [ giving the sanction of the church too hastily in reinstating expelled offenders or in ordination in questionable cases ] , nor share or participate in another man ’ s sins ; keep yourself pure .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	23	Drink water no longer exclusively , but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some men are conspicuous ( openly evident to all eyes ) , going before them to the judgment [ seat ] and proclaiming their sentence in advance ; but the sins of others appear later [ following the offender to the bar of judgment and coming into view there ] .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	5	25	So also , good deeds are evident and conspicuous , and even when they are not , they can not remain hidden [ indefinitely ] . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	6	[ And it is , indeed , a source of immense profit , for ] godliness accompanied with contentment ( that contentment which is a sense of [ d ] inward sufficiency ) is great and abundant gain .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	2	Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful or scornful [ to them ] on the grounds that they are brothers [ in Christ ] ; rather , they should serve [ them all the better ] because those who benefit by their kindly service are believers and beloved . Teach and urge these duties .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	3	But if anyone teaches otherwise and does not [ a ] assent to the sound and wholesome messages of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and the teaching which is in agreement with godliness ( piety toward God ) ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	4	He is puffed up with pride and stupefied with conceit , [ although he is ] woefully ignorant . He has a [ b ] morbid fondness for controversy and disputes and strife about words , which result in ( produce ) envy and jealousy , quarrels and dissension , abuse and insults and slander , and base suspicions ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	5	And protracted wrangling and wearing discussion and perpetual friction among men who are corrupted in mind and bereft of the truth , who imagine that godliness or righteousness is a [ c ] source of profit [ a moneymaking business , a means of livelihood ] . From such withdraw .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into the world , and obviously we can not take anything out of the world ;
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	8	But if we have food and clothing , with these we shall be content ( satisfied ) .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	9	But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish ( useless , godless ) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is a root of all evils ; it is through this craving that some have been led astray and have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves through with many [ e ] acute [ mental ] pangs .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	11	But as for you , O man of God , flee from all these things ; aim at and pursue righteousness ( right standing with God and true goodness ) , godliness ( which is the loving fear of God and being Christlike ) , faith , love , steadfastness ( patience ) , and gentleness of heart .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of the faith ; lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and [ for which ] you confessed the good confession [ of faith ] before many witnesses .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	13	In the presence of God , Who preserves alive all living things , and of Christ Jesus , Who in His testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession , I [ solemnly ] charge you
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	14	To keep all His precepts unsullied and flawless , irreproachable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	15	Which [ appearing ] will be shown forth in His own proper time by the blessed , only Sovereign ( Ruler ) , the King of kings and the Lord of lords ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	16	Who alone has immortality [ in the sense of exemption from every kind of death ] and lives in unapproachable light , Whom no man has ever seen or can see . Unto Him be honor and everlasting power and dominion . Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	17	As for the rich in this world , charge them not to be proud and arrogant and contemptuous of others , nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches , but on God , Who richly and ceaselessly provides us with everything for [ our ] enjoyment .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	18	[ Charge them ] to do good , to be rich in good works , to be liberal and generous of heart , ready to share [ with others ] ,
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	19	In this way laying up for themselves [ the riches that endure forever as ] a good foundation for the future , so that they may grasp that which is life indeed .
AMPC	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timothy , guard and keep the deposit entrusted [ to you ] ! Turn away from the irreverent babble and godless chatter , with the vain and empty and worldly phrases , and the subtleties and the contradictions in what is falsely called knowledge and spiritual illumination .

AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle ( special messenger ) of Christ Jesus by the will of God , according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God Whom I worship with a pure conscience , [ a ] in the spirit of my fathers , when without ceasing I remember you night and day in my prayers ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	4	And when , as I recall your tears , I yearn to see you so that I may be filled with joy .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	5	I am calling up memories of your sincere and unqualified faith ( the [ b ] leaning of your entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) , [ a faith ] that first lived permanently in [ the heart of ] your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now , I am [ fully ] persuaded , [ dwells ] in you also .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	6	That is why I would remind you to stir up ( rekindle the embers of , fan the flame of , and keep burning ) the [ gracious ] gift of God , [ the inner fire ] that is in you by means of the laying on of my hands [ [ c ] with those of the elders at your ordination ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	7	For God did not give us a spirit of timidity ( of cowardice , of craven and cringing and fawning fear ) , but [ He has given us a spirit ] of power and of love and of calm and well-balanced mind and discipline and self-control .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	8	Do not blush or be ashamed then , to testify to and for our Lord , nor of me , a prisoner for His sake , but [ [ d ] with me ] take your share of the suffering [ to which the preaching ] of the Gospel [ may expose you , and do it ] in the power of God .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	9	[ For it is He ] Who delivered and saved us and called us with a calling in itself holy and leading to holiness [ to a life of consecration , a vocation of holiness ] ; [ He did it ] not because of anything of merit that we have done , but because of and to further His own purpose and grace ( unmerited favor ) which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [ eternal ages ago ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	10	[ It is that purpose and grace ] which He now has made known and has fully disclosed and made real [ to us ] through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus , Who annulled death and made it of no effect and brought life and immortality ( immunity from eternal death ) to light through the Gospel .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	11	For [ the proclaiming of ] this [ Gospel ] I was appointed a herald ( preacher ) and an apostle ( special messenger ) and a teacher of the Gentiles .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	12	And this is why I am suffering as I do . Still I am not ashamed , for I know ( perceive , have knowledge of , and am acquainted with ) Him Whom I have believed ( adhered to and trusted in and relied on ) , and I am [ positively ] persuaded that He is able to guard and keep that which has been entrusted to me and which [ e ] I have committed [ to Him ] until that day .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	13	Hold fast and follow the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching which you have heard from me , in [ all ] the faith and love which are [ for us ] in Christ Jesus .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	14	Guard and keep [ with the greatest care ] the precious and excellently adapted [ Truth ] which has been entrusted [ to you ] , by the [ help of the ] Holy Spirit Who makes His home in us .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	15	You already know that all who are in Asia turned away and forsook me , Phygelus and Hermogenes among them .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord grant [ His ] mercy to the family of Onesiphorus , for he often showed me kindness and ministered to my needs [ comforting and reviving and bracing me like fresh air ] ! He was not ashamed of my chains and imprisonment [ for Christ ’ s sake ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	17	No , rather when he reached Rome , he searched diligently and eagerly for me and found me .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	1	18	May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on that [ great ] day ! And you know how many things he did for me and what a help he was at Ephesus [ you know better than I can tell you ] . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	8	Constantly keep in mind Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) [ as ] risen from the dead , [ as the prophesied King ] descended from David , according to the good news ( the Gospel ) that I preach . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	9	For that [ Gospel ] I am suffering affliction and even wearing chains like a criminal . But the Word of God is not chained or imprisoned !
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore I [ am ready to ] persevere and stand my ground with patience and endure everything for the sake of the elect [ God ’ s chosen ] , so that they too may obtain [ the ] salvation which is in Christ Jesus , with [ the reward of ] eternal glory .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	11	The saying is sure and worthy of confidence : If we have died with Him , we shall also live with Him .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we endure , we shall also reign with Him . If we deny and disown and reject Him , He will also deny and disown and reject us .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are faithless [ do not believe and are untrue to Him ] , He remains true ( faithful to His Word and His righteous character ) , for He can not deny Himself .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	14	Remind [ the people ] of these facts and [ solemnly ] charge them in the presence of the Lord to avoid petty controversy over words , which does no good but upsets and undermines the faith of the hearers .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	15	Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved ( tested by trial ) , a workman who has no cause to be ashamed , correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [ rightly handling and skillfully teaching ] the Word of Truth .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	16	But avoid all empty ( vain , useless , idle ) talk , for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	17	And their teaching [ will devour ; it ] will eat its way like cancer or spread like gangrene . So it is with Hymenaeus and Philetus ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	18	Who have missed the mark and swerved from the truth by arguing that the resurrection has already taken place . They are undermining the faith of some .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	19	But the firm foundation of ( laid by ) God stands , sure and unshaken , bearing this seal ( inscription ) : The Lord knows those who are His , and , Let everyone who names [ himself by ] the name of the Lord give up all iniquity and stand aloof from it . ( B )
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but also [ utensils ] of wood and earthenware , and some for honorable and noble [ use ] and some for menial and ignoble [ use ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	21	So whoever cleanses himself [ from what is ignoble and unclean , who separates himself from contact with contaminating and corrupting influences ] will [ then himself ] be a vessel set apart and useful for honorable and noble purposes , consecrated and profitable to the Master , fit and ready for any good work .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	22	Shun youthful lusts and flee from them , and aim at and pursue righteousness ( all that is virtuous and good , right living , conformity to the will of God in thought , word , and deed ) ; [ and aim at and pursue ] faith , love , [ and ] peace ( harmony and concord with others ) in fellowship with all [ Christians ] , who call upon the Lord out of a pure heart .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	23	But refuse ( shut your mind against , have nothing to do with ) trifling ( ill-informed , unedifying , stupid ) controversies over ignorant questionings , for you know that they foster strife and breed quarrels .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	24	And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome ( fighting and contending ) . Instead , he must be kindly to everyone and mild-tempered [ preserving the bond of peace ] ; he must be a skilled and suitable teacher , patient and forbearing and willing to suffer wrong .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	25	He must correct his opponents with courtesy and gentleness , in the hope that God may grant that they will repent and come to know the Truth [ that they will perceive and recognize and become accurately acquainted with and acknowledge it ] ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	2	26	And that they may come to their senses [ and ] escape out of the snare of the devil , having been held captive by him , [ henceforth ] to do His [ God ’ s ] will . Copyright ©

AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	3	[ They will be ] without natural [ human ] affection ( callous and inhuman ) , relentless ( admitting of no truce or appeasement ) ; [ they will be ] slanderers ( false accusers , troublemakers ) , intemperate and loose in morals and conduct , uncontrolled and fierce , haters of good .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	4	[ They will be ] treacherous [ betrayers ] , rash , [ and ] inflated with self-conceit . [ They will be ] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	5	For [ although ] they hold a form of piety ( true religion ) , they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it [ their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession ] . Avoid [ all ] such people [ turn away from them ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	6	For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weak-natured and spiritually dwarfed women , loaded down with [ the burden of their ] sins [ and easily ] swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	7	[ These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them ] ; they are forever inquiring and getting information , but are never able to arrive at a recognition and knowledge of the Truth .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	8	Now just as [ a ] Jannes and Jambres were hostile to and resisted Moses , so these men also are hostile to and oppose the Truth . They have depraved and distorted minds , and are reprobate and counterfeit and to be rejected as far as the faith is concerned . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they will not get very far , for their rash folly will become obvious to everybody , as was that of those [ magicians mentioned ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	10	Now you have closely observed and diligently followed my teaching , conduct , purpose in life , faith , patience , love , steadfastness ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	11	Persecutions , sufferings—such as occurred to me at Antioch , at Iconium , and at Lystra , persecutions I endured , but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	12	Indeed all who delight in piety and are determined to live a devoted and godly life in Christ Jesus will meet with persecution [ will be made to suffer because of their religious stand ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	13	But wicked men and imposters will go on from bad to worse , deceiving and leading astray others and being deceived and led astray themselves .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	14	But as for you , continue to hold to the things that you have learned and of which you are convinced , knowing from whom you learned [ them ] ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	15	And how from your childhood you have had a knowledge of and been acquainted with the sacred Writings , which are able to instruct you and give you the understanding for salvation which comes through faith in Christ Jesus [ through the [ b ] leaning of the entire human personality on God in Christ Jesus in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	3	16	Every Scripture is God-breathed ( given by His inspiration ) and profitable for instruction , for reproof and conviction of sin , for correction of error and discipline in obedience , [ and ] for training in righteousness ( in holy living , in conformity to God ’ s will in thought , purpose , and action ) ,

AMPC	2%20Timothy	4	3	For the time is coming when [ people ] will not tolerate ( endure ) sound and wholesome instruction , but , having ears itching [ for something pleasing and gratifying ] , they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number , chosen to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors they hold ,
AMPC	2%20Timothy	4	5	As for you , be calm and cool and steady , accept and suffer unflinchingly every hardship , do the work of an evangelist , fully perform all the duties of your ministry .
AMPC	2%20Timothy	4	6	For I am already about to be sacrificed [ my life is about to be poured out as a drink offering ] ; the time of my [ spirit ’ s ] release [ from the body ] is at hand and I will soon go free .

AMPC	Titus	1	1	Paul , a bond servant of God and an apostle ( a special messenger ) of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) to stimulate and promote the faith of God ’ s chosen ones and to lead them on to accurate discernment and recognition of and acquaintance with the Truth which belongs to and harmonizes with and tends to godliness ,
AMPC	Titus	1	2	[ Resting ] in the hope of eternal life , [ life ] which the ever truthful God Who can not deceive promised before the world or the ages of time began .
AMPC	Titus	1	3	And [ now ] in His own appointed time He has made manifest ( made known ) His Word and revealed it as His message through the preaching entrusted to me by command of God our Savior ;
AMPC	Titus	1	4	To Titus , my true child according to a common ( general ) faith : Grace ( favor and spiritual blessing ) and [ heart ] peace from God the Father and the Lord Christ Jesus our Savior .
AMPC	Titus	1	5	For this reason I left you [ behind ] in Crete , that you might set right what was defective and finish what was left undone , and that you might appoint elders and set them over the churches ( assemblies ) in every city as I directed you .
AMPC	Titus	1	6	[ These elders should be ] men who are of unquestionable integrity and are irreproachable , the husband of [ but ] one wife , whose children are [ well trained and are ] believers , not open to the accusation of being loose in morals and conduct or unruly and disorderly .
AMPC	Titus	1	7	For the bishop ( an overseer ) as God ’ s steward must be blameless , not self-willed or arrogant or presumptuous ; he must not be quick-tempered or given to drink or pugnacious ( brawling , violent ) ; he must not be grasping and greedy for filthy lucre ( financial gain ) ;
AMPC	Titus	1	8	But he must be hospitable ( loving and a friend to believers , especially to strangers and foreigners ) ; [ he must be ] a lover of goodness [ of good people and good things ] , sober-minded ( sensible , discreet ) , upright and fair-minded , a devout man and religiously correct , temperate and keeping himself in hand .
AMPC	Titus	1	9	He must hold fast to the sure and trustworthy Word of God as he was taught it , so that he may be able both to give stimulating instruction and encouragement in sound ( wholesome ) doctrine and to refute and convict those who contradict and oppose it [ showing the wayward their error ] .
AMPC	Titus	1	10	For there are many disorderly and unruly men who are idle ( vain , empty ) and misleading talkers and self-deceivers and deceivers of others . [ This is true ] especially of those of the circumcision party [ who have come over from Judaism ] .
AMPC	Titus	1	11	Their mouths must be stopped , for they are mentally distressing and subverting whole families by teaching what they ought not to teach , for the purpose of getting base advantage and disreputable gain .
AMPC	Titus	1	12	One of their [ very ] number , a prophet of their own , said , Cretans are always liars , hurtful beasts , idle and lazy gluttons .
AMPC	Titus	1	13	And this account of them is [ really ] true . Because it is [ true ] , rebuke them sharply [ deal sternly , even severely with them ] , so that they may be sound in the faith and free from error ,
AMPC	Titus	1	14	[ And may show their soundness by ] ceasing to give attention to Jewish myths and fables or to rules [ laid down ] by [ mere ] men who reject and turn their backs on the Truth .
AMPC	Titus	1	15	To the pure [ in heart and conscience ] all things are pure , but to the defiled and corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure ; their very minds and consciences are defiled and polluted .
AMPC	Titus	1	16	They profess to know God [ to recognize , perceive , and be acquainted with Him ] , but deny and disown and renounce Him by what they do ; they are detestable and loathsome , unbelieving and disobedient and disloyal and rebellious , and [ they are ] unfit and worthless for good work ( deed or enterprise ) of any kind .

AMPC	Titus	2	2	Urge the older men to be temperate , venerable ( serious ) , sensible , self-controlled , and sound in the faith , in the love , and in the steadfastness and patience [ of Christ ] .
AMPC	Titus	2	3	Bid the older women similarly to be reverent and devout in their deportment as becomes those engaged in sacred service , not slanderers or slaves to drink . They are to give good counsel and be teachers of what is right and noble ,
AMPC	Titus	2	4	So that they will wisely train the young women to be [ a ] sane and sober of mind ( temperate , disciplined ) and to love their husbands and their children ,
AMPC	Titus	2	5	To be self-controlled , chaste , homemakers , good-natured ( kindhearted ) , adapting and subordinating themselves to their husbands , that the word of God may not be exposed to reproach ( blasphemed or discredited ) .
AMPC	Titus	2	6	In a similar way , urge the younger men to be self-restrained and to behave prudently [ taking life seriously ] .
AMPC	Titus	2	7	And show your own self in all respects to be a pattern and a model of good deeds and works , teaching what is unadulterated , showing gravity [ having the strictest regard for truth and purity of motive ] , with dignity and seriousness .
AMPC	Titus	2	8	And let your instruction be sound and fit and wise and wholesome , vigorous and [ b ] irrefutable and above censure , so that the opponent may be put to shame , finding nothing discrediting or evil to say about us .
AMPC	Titus	2	9	[ Tell ] bond servants to be submissive to their masters , to be pleasing and give satisfaction in every way . [ Warn them ] not to talk back or contradict ,
AMPC	Titus	2	10	Nor to steal by taking things of small value , but to prove themselves truly loyal and entirely reliable and faithful throughout , so that in everything they may be an ornament and do credit to the teaching [ which is ] from and about God our Savior .
AMPC	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God ( His unmerited favor and blessing ) has come forward ( appeared ) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind .
AMPC	Titus	2	12	It has trained us to reject and renounce all ungodliness ( irreligion ) and worldly ( passionate ) desires , to live discreet ( temperate , self-controlled ) , upright , devout ( spiritually whole ) lives in this present world ,
AMPC	Titus	2	13	Awaiting and looking for the [ fulfillment , the realization of our ] blessed hope , even the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Christ Jesus ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) ,
AMPC	Titus	2	14	Who gave Himself on our behalf that He might redeem us ( purchase our freedom ) from all iniquity and purify for Himself a people [ to be peculiarly His own , people who are ] eager and enthusiastic about [ living a life that is good and filled with ] beneficial deeds . ( A )
AMPC	Titus	2	15	Tell [ them all ] these things . Urge ( advise , encourage , warn ) and rebuke with full authority . Let no one despise or disregard or think little of you [ conduct yourself and your teaching so as to command respect ] . Copyright ©

AMPC	Titus	3	3	For we also were once thoughtless and senseless , obstinate and disobedient , deluded and misled ; [ we too were once ] slaves to all sorts of cravings and pleasures , wasting our days in malice and jealousy and envy , hateful ( hated , detestable ) and hating one another .
AMPC	Titus	3	2	To slander or abuse or speak evil of no one , to avoid being contentious , to be forbearing ( yielding , gentle , and conciliatory ) , and to show unqualified courtesy toward everybody .
AMPC	Titus	3	4	But when the goodness and loving-kindness of God our Savior to man [ as man ] appeared ,
AMPC	Titus	3	5	He saved us , not because of any works of righteousness that we had done , but because of His own pity and mercy , by [ the ] cleansing [ bath ] of the new birth ( regeneration ) and renewing of the Holy Spirit ,
AMPC	Titus	3	6	Which He poured out [ so ] richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior .
AMPC	Titus	3	7	[ And He did it in order ] that we might be justified by His grace ( by His favor , wholly undeserved ) , [ that we might be acknowledged and counted as conformed to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action ] , and that we might become heirs of eternal life according to [ our ] hope .
AMPC	Titus	3	8	This message is most trustworthy , and concerning these things I want you to insist steadfastly , so that those who have believed in ( trusted in , relied on ) God may be careful to apply themselves to honorable occupations and to doing good , for such things are [ not only ] excellent and right [ in themselves ] , but [ they are ] good and profitable for the people .
AMPC	Titus	3	9	But avoid stupid and foolish controversies and genealogies and dissensions and wrangling about the Law , for they are unprofitable and futile .
AMPC	Titus	3	10	[ As for ] a man who is factious [ a heretical sectarian and cause of divisions ] , after admonishing him a first and second time , reject [ him from your fellowship and have nothing more to do with him ] ,
AMPC	Titus	3	11	Well aware that such a person has utterly changed ( is perverted and corrupted ) ; he goes on sinning [ though he ] is convicted of guilt and self-condemned .
AMPC	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or [ perhaps ] Tychicus to you , lose no time but make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis , for I have decided to spend the winter there .
AMPC	Titus	3	13	Do your utmost to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way ; see that they want for ( lack ) nothing .
AMPC	Titus	3	14	And let our own [ people really ] learn to apply themselves to good deeds ( to honest labor and honorable employment ) , so that they may be able to meet necessary demands [ a ] whenever the occasion may require and not be living idle and uncultivated and unfruitful lives .
AMPC	Titus	3	15	All who are with me wish to be remembered to you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace ( God ’ s favor and blessing ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes - Titus 3:14 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . Copyright ©

AMPC	Philemon	1	2	And to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier [ in the Christian warfare ] , and to the church [ assembly that meets ] in your house :
AMPC	Philemon	1	3	Grace ( spiritual blessing and favor ) be to all of you and [ heart ] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	Philemon	1	4	I give thanks to my God for you always when I mention you in my prayers ,
AMPC	Philemon	1	5	Because I continue to hear of your love and of your loyal faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and [ which you show ] toward all the saints ( God ’ s consecrated people ) .
AMPC	Philemon	1	6	[ And I pray ] that the participation in and sharing of your faith may produce and promote full recognition and appreciation and understanding and precise knowledge of every good [ thing ] that is ours in [ our identification with ] Christ Jesus [ and unto His glory ] .
AMPC	Philemon	1	7	For I have derived great joy and comfort and encouragement from your love , because the hearts of the saints [ who are your fellow Christians ] have been cheered and refreshed through you , [ my ] brother .
AMPC	Philemon	1	8	Therefore , though I have abundant boldness in Christ to charge you to do what is fitting and required and your duty to do ,
AMPC	Philemon	1	9	Yet for love ’ s sake I prefer to appeal to you just for what I am—I , Paul , an ambassador [ of Christ Jesus ] and an old man and now a prisoner for His sake also—
AMPC	Philemon	1	10	I appeal to you for my [ own spiritual ] child , Onesimus [ meaning profitable ] , whom I have begotten [ in the faith ] while a captive in these chains .
AMPC	Philemon	1	11	Once he was unprofitable to you , but now he is indeed profitable to you as well as to me .
AMPC	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back to you in [ a ] his own person , [ and it is like sending ] my very heart .
AMPC	Philemon	1	13	I would have chosen to keep him with me , in order that he might minister to my needs in your stead during my imprisonment for the Gospel ’ s sake .
AMPC	Philemon	1	14	But it has been my wish to do nothing about it without first consulting you and getting your consent , in order that your benevolence might not seem to be the result of compulsion or of pressure but might be voluntary [ on your part ] .
AMPC	Philemon	1	15	Perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated [ from you ] for a while , that you might have him back as yours forever ,
AMPC	Philemon	1	16	Not as a slave any longer but as [ something ] more than a slave , as a brother [ Christian ] , especially dear to me but how much more to you , both in the flesh [ as a servant ] and in the Lord [ as a fellow believer ] .
AMPC	Philemon	1	17	If then you consider me a partner and a [ b ] comrade in fellowship , welcome and receive him as you would [ welcome and receive ] me .
AMPC	Philemon	1	18	And if he has done you any wrong in any way or owes anything [ to you ] , charge that to my account .
AMPC	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , write it with my own hand , I promise to repay it [ in full ] —and that is to say nothing [ of the fact ] that you owe me your very self !
AMPC	Philemon	1	20	Yes , brother , let me have some profit from you in the Lord . Cheer and refresh my heart in Christ .
AMPC	Philemon	1	21	I write to you [ perfectly ] confident of your obedient compliance , knowing that you will do even more than I ask .
AMPC	Philemon	1	22	At the same time prepare a guest room [ in expectation of extending your hospitality ] to me , for I am hoping through your prayers to be granted [ the gracious privilege of coming ] to you .
AMPC	Philemon	1	23	Greetings to you from Epaphras , my fellow prisoner here in [ the cause of ] Christ Jesus ( the Messiah ) ,
AMPC	Philemon	1	24	And [ from ] Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke , my fellow workers .
AMPC	Philemon	1	25	The grace ( blessing and favor ) of the Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) be with your spirit . Amen ( so be it ) . Footnotes - Philemon 1:12 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies in the New Testament . - Philemon 1:17 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies in the New Testament . Copyright ©

AMPC	Hebrews	1	1	In many separate revelations [ [ a ] each of which set forth a portion of the Truth ] and in different ways God spoke of old to [ our ] forefathers in and by the prophets ,
AMPC	Hebrews	1	2	[ But ] in [ b ] the last of these days He has spoken to us in [ the person of a ] Son , Whom He appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things , also by and through Whom He created the worlds and the reaches of space and the ages of time [ He made , produced , built , operated , and arranged them in order ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	1	3	He is the sole expression of the glory of God [ the Light-being , the [ c ] out-raying or radiance of the divine ] , and He is the perfect imprint and very image of [ God ’ s ] nature , upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by His mighty word of power . When He had by offering Himself accomplished our cleansing of sins and riddance of guilt , He sat down at the right hand of the divine Majesty on high ,
AMPC	Hebrews	1	4	[ Taking a place and rank by which ] He Himself became as much superior to angels as the glorious Name ( title ) which He has inherited is different from and more excellent than theirs .
AMPC	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did [ God ] ever say , You are My Son , today I have begotten You [ established You in an official Sonship relation , with kingly dignity ] ? And again , I will be to Him a Father , and He will be to Me a Son ? ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	1	6	Moreover , when He brings the firstborn Son [ d ] again into the habitable world , He says , Let all the angels of God worship Him .
AMPC	Hebrews	1	7	Referring to the angels He says , [ God ] Who makes His angels winds and His ministering servants flames of fire ; ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	1	8	But as to the Son , He says to Him , Your throne , O God , is forever and ever ( to the ages of the ages ) , and the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of absolute righteousness ( of justice and straightforwardness ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	1	9	You have loved righteousness [ You have delighted in integrity , virtue , and uprightness in purpose , thought , and action ] and You have hated lawlessness ( injustice and iniquity ) . Therefore God , [ even ] Your God ( [ e ] Godhead ) , has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy and gladness above and beyond Your companions . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	1	10	And [ further ] , You , Lord , did lay the foundation of the earth in the beginning , and the heavens are the works of Your hands .
AMPC	Hebrews	1	11	They will perish , but You remain and continue permanently ; they will all grow old and wear out like a garment .
AMPC	Hebrews	1	12	Like a mantle [ thrown about one ’ s self ] You will roll them up , and they will be changed and replaced by others . But You remain the same , and Your years will never end nor come to failure . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	1	13	Besides , to which of the angels has He ever said , Sit at My right hand [ associated with Me in My royal dignity ] till I make your enemies a stool for your feet ? ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	1	14	Are not the angels all ministering spirits ( servants ) sent out in the service [ of God for the assistance ] of those who are to inherit salvation ?

AMPC	Hebrews	2	2	For if the message given through angels [ the Law spoken by them to Moses ] was authentic and proved sure , and every violation and disobedience received an appropriate ( just and adequate ) penalty ,
AMPC	Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape [ appropriate retribution ] if we neglect and refuse to pay attention to such a great salvation [ as is now offered to us , letting it drift past us forever ] ? For it was declared at first by the Lord [ Himself ] , and it was confirmed to us and proved to be real and genuine by those who personally heard [ Him speak ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	4	[ Besides this evidence ] it was also established and plainly endorsed by God , Who showed His approval of it by signs and wonders and various miraculous manifestations of [ His ] power and by imparting the gifts of the Holy Spirit [ to the believers ] according to His own will .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	5	For it was not to angels that God subjected the habitable world of the future , of which we are speaking .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	6	It has been solemnly and earnestly said in a certain place , What is man that You are mindful of him , or the son of man that You graciously and helpfully care for and visit and look after him ?
AMPC	Hebrews	2	7	For some little time You have ranked him lower than and inferior to the angels ; You have crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of Your hands , ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	2	8	For You have put everything in subjection under his feet . Now in putting everything in subjection to man , He left nothing outside [ of man ’ s ] control . But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him [ man ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	9	But we are able to see Jesus , Who was ranked lower than the angels for a little while , crowned with glory and honor because of His having suffered death , in order that by the grace ( unmerited favor ) of God [ to us sinners ] He might experience death for every individual person .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	10	For it was an act worthy [ of God ] and fitting [ to the divine nature ] that He , for Whose sake and by Whom all things have their existence , in bringing many sons into glory , should make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect [ should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest ] through suffering .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	11	For both He Who sanctifies [ making men holy ] and those who are sanctified all have one [ Father ] . For this reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren ;
AMPC	Hebrews	2	12	For He says , I will declare Your [ the Father ’ s ] name to My brethren ; in the midst of the [ worshiping ] congregation I will sing hymns of praise to You . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	2	13	And again He says , My trust and assured reliance and confident hope shall be fixed in Him . And yet again , Here I am , I and the children whom God has given Me . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	2	14	Since , therefore , [ these His ] children share in flesh and blood [ in the physical nature of human beings ] , He [ Himself ] in a similar manner partook of the same [ nature ] , that by [ going through ] death He might bring to nought and make of no effect him who had the power of death—that is , the devil—
AMPC	Hebrews	2	15	And also that He might deliver and completely set free all those who through the [ haunting ] fear of death were held in bondage throughout the whole course of their lives .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	16	For , as we all know , He [ Christ ] did not take hold of angels [ [ a ] the fallen angels , to give them a helping and delivering hand ] , but He did take hold of [ [ b ] the fallen ] descendants of Abraham [ to reach out to them a helping and delivering hand ] . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	2	17	So it is evident that it was essential that He be made like His brethren in every respect , in order that He might become a merciful ( sympathetic ) and faithful High Priest in the things related to God , to make atonement and propitiation for the people ’ s sins .
AMPC	Hebrews	2	18	For because He Himself [ in His humanity ] has suffered in being tempted ( tested and tried ) , He is able [ immediately ] [ c ] to run to the cry of ( assist , relieve ) those who are being tempted and tested and tried [ and who therefore are being exposed to suffering ] .

AMPC	Hebrews	3	3	Yet Jesus has been considered worthy of much greater honor and glory than Moses , just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house [ itself ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	2	[ See how ] faithful He was to Him Who appointed Him [ Apostle and High Priest ] , as Moses was also faithful in the whole house [ of God ] . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	3	4	For [ of course ] every house is built and furnished by someone , but the Builder of all things and the Furnisher [ of the entire equipment of all things ] is God .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	5	And Moses certainly was faithful in the administration of all God ’ s house [ but it was only ] as a ministering servant . [ In his entire ministry he was but ] a testimony to the things which were to be spoken [ the revelations to be given afterward in Christ ] . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ ( the Messiah ) was faithful over His [ own Father ’ s ] house as a Son [ and Master of it ] . And it is we who are [ now members ] of this house , if we hold fast and firm to the end our joyful and exultant confidence and sense of triumph in our hope [ in Christ ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says : Today , if you will hear His voice ,
AMPC	Hebrews	3	8	Do not harden your hearts , as [ happened ] in the rebellion [ of Israel ] and their provocation and [ a ] embitterment [ of Me ] in the day of testing in the wilderness ,
AMPC	Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tried [ My patience ] and tested [ My forbearance ] and [ b ] found I stood their test , and they saw My works for forty years .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	10	And so I was provoked ( displeased and sorely grieved ) with that generation , and said , They always err and are led astray in their hearts , and they have not perceived or recognized My ways and become progressively better and more experimentally and intimately acquainted with them .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	11	Accordingly , I swore in My wrath and indignation , They shall not enter into My rest . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	3	12	[ Therefore beware ] brethren , take care , lest there be in any one of you a wicked , unbelieving heart [ which refuses to cleave to , trust in , and rely on Him ] , leading you to turn away and desert or stand aloof from the living God .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	13	But instead warn ( admonish , urge , and encourage ) one another every day , as long as it is called Today , that none of you may be hardened [ into settled rebellion ] by the deceitfulness of sin [ by the fraudulence , the stratagem , the trickery which the delusive glamor of his sin may play on him ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	14	For we [ c ] have become fellows with Christ ( the Messiah ) and share in all He has for us , if only we hold our first newborn confidence and original assured expectation [ in virtue of which we are believers ] firm and unshaken to the end .
AMPC	Hebrews	3	15	Then while it is [ still ] called Today , if you would hear His voice and when you hear it , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion [ in the desert , when the people provoked and irritated and embittered God against them ] . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	3	16	For who were they who heard and yet were rebellious and provoked [ Him ] ? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses ?
AMPC	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was He irritated and provoked and grieved for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose [ d ] dismembered bodies were strewn and left in the desert ?
AMPC	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did He swear that they should not enter His rest , but to those who disobeyed [ who had not listened to His word and who refused to be compliant or be persuaded ] ?
AMPC	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they were not able to enter [ into His rest ] , because of their unwillingness to adhere to and trust in and rely on God [ unbelief had shut them out ] .

AMPC	Hebrews	4	4	For in a certain place He has said this about the seventh day : And God rested on the seventh day from all His works . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had the glad tidings [ Gospel of God ] proclaimed to us just as truly as they [ the Israelites of old did when the good news of deliverance from bondage came to them ] ; but the message they heard did not benefit them , because it was not mixed with faith ( with [ c ] the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) by those who heard it ; [ d ] neither were they united in faith with the ones [ Joshua and Caleb ] who heard ( did believe ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed ( adhered to and trusted in and relied on God ) do enter that rest , [ e ] in accordance with His declaration that those [ who did not believe ] should not enter when He said , As I swore in My wrath , They shall not enter My rest ; and this He said although [ His ] works had been completed and prepared [ and waiting for all who would believe ] from the foundation of the world . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	4	5	And [ they forfeited their part in it , for ] in this [ passage ] He said , They shall not enter My rest . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing then that the promise remains over [ from past times ] for some to enter that rest , and that those who formerly were given the good news about it and the opportunity , failed to appropriate it and did not enter because of disobedience ,
AMPC	Hebrews	4	7	Again He sets a definite day , [ a new ] Today , [ and gives another opportunity of securing that rest ] saying through David after so long a time in the words already quoted , Today , if you would hear His voice and when you hear it , do not harden your hearts . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	4	8	[ This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan . ] For if Joshua had given them rest , He [ God ] would not speak afterward about another day .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	9	So then , there is still awaiting a full and complete Sabbath-rest reserved for the [ true ] people of God ;
AMPC	Hebrews	4	10	For he who has once entered [ God ’ s ] rest also has ceased from [ the weariness and pain ] of human labors , just as God rested from those labors [ f ] peculiarly His own . ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest [ of God , to know and experience it for ourselves ] , that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience [ into which those in the wilderness fell ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	12	For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [ making it active , operative , energizing , and effective ] ; it is sharper than any two-edged sword , penetrating to the dividing line of the [ g ] breath of life ( soul ) and [ the immortal ] spirit , and of joints and marrow [ of the deepest parts of our nature ] , exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	13	And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight , but all things are open and exposed , naked and defenseless to the eyes of Him with Whom we have to do .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	14	Inasmuch then as we have a great High Priest Who has [ already ] ascended and passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession [ of faith in Him ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a High Priest Who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation , but One Who has been tempted in every respect as we are , yet without sinning .
AMPC	Hebrews	4	16	Let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of grace ( the throne of God ’ s unmerited favor to us sinners ) , that we may receive mercy [ for our failures ] and find grace to help in good time for every need [ appropriate help and well-timed help , coming just when we need it ] .

AMPC	Hebrews	5	5	So too Christ ( the Messiah ) did not exalt Himself to be made a high priest , but was appointed and exalted by Him Who said to Him , You are My Son ; today I have begotten You ; ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	5	2	He is able to exercise gentleness and forbearance toward the ignorant and erring , since he himself also is liable to moral weakness and physical infirmity .
AMPC	Hebrews	5	3	And because of this he is obliged to offer sacrifice for his own sins , as well as for those of the people .
AMPC	Hebrews	5	4	Besides , one does not appropriate for himself the honor [ of being high priest ] , but he is called by God and receives it of Him , just as Aaron did .
AMPC	Hebrews	5	6	As He says also in another place , You are a Priest [ appointed ] forever after the order ( with [ a ] the rank ) of Melchizedek . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	5	7	In the days of His flesh [ Jesus ] offered up definite , special petitions [ for that which He not only wanted [ b ] but needed ] and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him Who was [ always ] able to save Him [ out ] from death , and He was heard because of His reverence toward God [ His godly fear , His piety , [ c ] in that He shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	5	8	Although He was a Son , He learned [ active , special ] obedience through what He suffered
AMPC	Hebrews	5	9	And , [ His completed experience ] making Him perfectly [ equipped ] , He became the Author and Source of eternal salvation to all those who give heed and obey Him , ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	5	10	Being [ d ] designated and recognized and saluted by God as High Priest after the order ( with [ e ] the rank ) of Melchizedek . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	5	11	Concerning this we have much to say which is hard to explain , since you have become dull in your [ spiritual ] hearing and sluggish [ even [ f ] slothful in achieving spiritual insight ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	5	12	For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others , you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God ’ s Word . You have come to need milk , not solid food .
AMPC	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who continues to feed on milk is obviously inexperienced and unskilled in the doctrine of righteousness ( of conformity to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action ) , for he is a mere infant [ not able to talk yet ] !
AMPC	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for full-grown men , for those whose senses and mental faculties are trained by practice to discriminate and distinguish between what is morally good and noble and what is evil and contrary either to divine or human law .

AMPC	Hebrews	6	6	If they then deviate from the faith and turn away from their allegiance— [ it is impossible ] to bring them back to repentance , for ( because , while , as long as ) they nail upon the cross the Son of God afresh [ as far as they are concerned ] and are holding [ Him ] up to contempt and shame and public disgrace .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	2	With teachings about purifying , the laying on of hands , the resurrection from the dead , and eternal judgment and punishment . [ These are all matters of which you should have been fully aware long , long ago . ]
AMPC	Hebrews	6	3	If indeed God permits , we will [ now ] proceed [ to advanced teaching ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible [ to restore and bring again to repentance ] those who have been once for all enlightened , who have consciously tasted the heavenly gift and have become sharers of the Holy Spirit ,
AMPC	Hebrews	6	5	And have felt how good the Word of God is and the mighty powers of the age and world to come ,
AMPC	Hebrews	6	7	For the soil which has drunk the rain that repeatedly falls upon it and produces vegetation useful to those for whose benefit it is cultivated partakes of a blessing from God .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	8	But if [ that same soil ] persistently bears thorns and thistles , it is considered worthless and near to being cursed , whose end is to be burned . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	6	9	Even though we speak this way , yet in your case , beloved , we are now firmly convinced of better things that are near to salvation and accompany it .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous to forget or overlook your labor and the love which you have shown for His name ’ s sake in ministering to the needs of the saints ( His own consecrated people ) , as you still do .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	11	But we do [ [ a ] strongly and earnestly ] desire for each of you to show the same diligence and sincerity [ all the way through ] in realizing and enjoying the full assurance and development of [ your ] hope until the end ,
AMPC	Hebrews	6	12	In order that you may not grow disinterested and become [ spiritual ] sluggards , but imitators , behaving as do those who through faith ( [ b ] by their leaning of the entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) and by practice of patient endurance and waiting are [ now ] inheriting the promises .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made [ His ] promise to Abraham , He swore by Himself , since He had no one greater by whom to swear ,
AMPC	Hebrews	6	14	Saying , Blessing I certainly will bless you and multiplying I will multiply you . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	6	15	And so it was that he [ Abraham ] , having waited long and endured patiently , realized and obtained [ in the birth of Isaac as a pledge of what was to come ] what God had promised him .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	16	Men indeed swear by a greater [ than themselves ] , and with them in all disputes the oath taken for confirmation is final [ ending strife ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	17	Accordingly God also , in His desire to show more convincingly and beyond doubt to those who were to inherit the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose and plan , intervened ( mediated ) with an oath .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	18	This was so that , by two unchangeable things [ His promise and His oath ] in which it is impossible for God ever to prove false or deceive us , we who have fled [ to Him ] for refuge might have mighty indwelling strength and strong encouragement to grasp and hold fast the hope appointed for us and set before [ us ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	6	19	[ Now ] we have this [ hope ] as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul [ it can not slip and it can not [ c ] break down under whoever steps out upon it—a hope ] that reaches [ d ] farther and enters into [ the very certainty of the Presence ] within the veil , ( C )

AMPC	Hebrews	7	7	Yet it is beyond all contradiction that it is the lesser person who is blessed by the greater one .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	2	And Abraham gave to him a tenth portion of all [ the spoil ] . He is primarily , as his name when translated indicates , king of righteousness , and then he is also king of Salem , which means king of peace .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	3	Without [ record of ] father or mother or ancestral line , neither with beginning of days nor ending of life , but , resembling the Son of God , he continues to be a priest without interruption and without successor .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	4	Now observe and consider how great [ a personage ] this was to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth [ the topmost or the pick of the heap ] of the spoils .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	5	And it is true that those descendants of Levi who are charged with the priestly office are commanded in the Law to take tithes from the people—which means , from their brethren—though these have descended from Abraham .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	6	But this person who has not their Levitical ancestry received tithes from Abraham [ himself ] and blessed him who possessed the promises [ of God ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	8	Furthermore , here [ in the Levitical priesthood ] tithes are received by men who are subject to death ; while there [ in the case of Melchizedek ] , they are received by one of whom it is testified that he lives [ perpetually ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	9	A person might even say that Levi [ the father of the priestly tribe ] himself , who received tithes ( the tenth ) , paid tithes through Abraham ,
AMPC	Hebrews	7	10	For he was still in the loins of his forefather [ Abraham ] when Melchizedek met him [ Abraham ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	11	Now if perfection ( a perfect fellowship between God and the worshiper ) had been attainable by the Levitical priesthood—for under it the people were given the Law—why was it further necessary that there should arise another and different kind of Priest , one after the order of Melchizedek , rather than one appointed after the order and rank of Aaron ?
AMPC	Hebrews	7	12	For when there is a change in the priesthood , there is of necessity an alteration of the law [ concerning the priesthood ] as well .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	13	For the One of Whom these things are said belonged [ not to the priestly line but ] to another tribe , no member of which has officiated at the altar .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	14	For it is obvious that our Lord sprang from the tribe of Judah , and Moses mentioned nothing about priests in connection with that tribe .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	15	And this becomes more plainly evident when another Priest arises Who bears the likeness of Melchizedek , ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	7	16	Who has been constituted a Priest , not on the basis of a bodily legal requirement [ an externally imposed command concerning His physical ancestry ] , but on the basis of the power of an endless and indestructible Life .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	17	For it is witnessed of Him , You are a Priest forever after the order ( with the rank ) of Melchizedek . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	7	18	So a previous physical regulation and command is cancelled because of its weakness and ineffectiveness and uselessness—
AMPC	Hebrews	7	19	For the Law never made anything perfect—but instead a better hope is introduced through which we [ now ] come close to God .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	20	And it was not without the taking of an oath [ that Christ was made Priest ] ,
AMPC	Hebrews	7	21	For those who formerly became priests received their office without its being confirmed by the taking of an oath by God , but this One was designated and addressed and saluted with an oath , The Lord has sworn and will not regret it or change His mind , You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	7	22	In keeping with [ the oath ’ s greater strength and force ] , Jesus has become the Guarantee of a better ( stronger ) agreement [ a more excellent and more advantageous covenant ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	23	[ Again , the former successive line of priests ] was made up of many , because they were each prevented by death from continuing [ perpetually in office ] ;
AMPC	Hebrews	7	24	But He holds His priesthood unchangeably , because He lives on forever .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is able also to save to the uttermost ( completely , perfectly , finally , and for all time and eternity ) those who come to God through Him , since He is always living to make petition to God and intercede with Him and intervene for them .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	26	[ Here is ] the High Priest [ perfectly adapted ] to our needs , as was fitting—holy , blameless , unstained by sin , separated from sinners , and exalted higher than the heavens .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	27	He has no day by day necessity , as [ do each of these other ] high priests , to offer sacrifice first of all for his own [ personal ] sins and then for those of the people , because He [ met all the requirements ] once for all when He brought Himself [ as a sacrifice ] which He offered up .
AMPC	Hebrews	7	28	For the Law sets up men in their weakness [ frail , sinful , dying human beings ] as high priests , but the word of [ God ’ s ] oath , which [ was spoken later ] after the institution of the Law , [ chooses and appoints as priest One Whose appointment is complete and permanent ] , a Son Who has been made perfect forever .

AMPC	Hebrews	8	8	However , He finds fault with them [ showing its inadequacy ] when He says , Behold , the days will come , says the Lord , when I will make and ratify a new covenant or agreement with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	2	As officiating Priest , a Minister in the holy places and in the true tabernacle which is erected not by man but by the Lord .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer up gifts and sacrifices ; so it is essential for this [ High Priest ] to have some offering to make also .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	4	If then He were still living on earth , He would not be a priest at all , for there are [ already priests ] who offer the gifts in accordance with the Law .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	5	[ But these offer ] service [ merely ] as a pattern and as a foreshadowing of [ what has its true existence and reality in ] the heavenly sanctuary . For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle , he was warned by God , saying , See to it that you make it all [ exactly ] according to the copy ( the model ) which was shown to you on the mountain . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	8	6	But as it now is , He [ Christ ] has acquired a [ priestly ] ministry which is as much superior and more excellent [ than the old ] as the covenant ( the agreement ) of which He is the Mediator ( the Arbiter , Agent ) is superior and more excellent , [ because ] it is enacted and rests upon more important ( sublimer , higher , and nobler ) promises .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been without defect , there would have been no room for another one or an attempt to institute another one .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day when I grasped them by the hand to help and relieve them and to lead them out from the land of Egypt , for they did not abide in My agreement with them , and so I withdrew My favor and disregarded them , says the Lord .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord : I will imprint My laws upon their minds , even upon their innermost thoughts and understanding , and engrave them upon their hearts ; and I will be their God , and they shall be My people .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	11	And it will nevermore be necessary for each one to teach his neighbor and his fellow citizen or each one his brother , saying , Know ( perceive , have knowledge of , and get acquainted by experience with ) the Lord , for all will know Me , from the smallest to the greatest of them .
AMPC	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful and gracious toward their sins and I will remember their deeds of unrighteousness no more . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	8	13	When God speaks of a new [ covenant or agreement ] , He makes the first one obsolete ( out of use ) . And what is obsolete ( out of use and annulled because of age ) is ripe for disappearance and to be dispensed with altogether . Copyright ©

AMPC	Hebrews	9	9	Seeing that that first [ outer portion of the ] tabernacle was a parable ( a visible symbol or type or picture of the present age ) . In it gifts and sacrifices are offered , and yet are incapable of perfecting the conscience or of cleansing and renewing the inner man of the worshiper .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle ( tent ) was erected , in the outer division or compartment of which were the lampstand and the table with [ its loaves of ] the showbread set forth . [ This portion ] is called the Holy Place . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	9	3	But [ inside ] beyond the second curtain or veil , [ there stood another ] tabernacle [ division ] known as the Holy of Holies . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	9	4	It had the golden [ a ] altar of incense and the ark ( chest ) of the covenant , covered over with wrought gold . This [ ark ] contained a golden jar which held the manna and the rod of Aaron that sprouted and the [ two stone ] slabs of the covenant [ bearing the Ten Commandments ] . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	9	5	Above [ the ark ] and overshadowing the mercy seat were the representations of the cherubim [ winged creatures which were the symbols ] of glory . We can not now go into detail about these things .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	6	These arrangements having thus been made , the priests enter [ habitually ] into the outer division of the tabernacle in performance of their ritual acts of worship .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second [ division of the tabernacle ] none but the high priest goes , and he only once a year , and never without taking a sacrifice of blood with him , which he offers for himself and for the errors and sins of ignorance and thoughtlessness which the people have committed . ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	9	8	By this the Holy Spirit points out that the way into the [ true Holy of ] Holies is not yet thrown open as long as the former [ the outer portion of the ] tabernacle remains a recognized institution and is still standing ,
AMPC	Hebrews	9	10	For [ the ceremonies ] deal only with clean and unclean meats and drinks and different washings , [ mere ] external rules and regulations for the body imposed to tide the worshipers over until the time of setting things straight [ of reformation , of the complete new order when Christ , the Messiah , shall establish the reality of what these things foreshadow—a better covenant ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	11	But [ that appointed time came ] when Christ ( the Messiah ) appeared as a High Priest of the better things that have come and are to come . [ Then ] through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with [ human ] hands , that is , not a part of this material creation ,
AMPC	Hebrews	9	12	He went once for all into the [ Holy of ] Holies [ of heaven ] , not by virtue of the blood of goats and calves [ by which to make reconciliation between God and man ] , but His own blood , having found and secured a complete redemption ( an everlasting release for us ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	13	For if [ the mere ] sprinkling of unholy and defiled persons with blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a burnt heifer is sufficient for the purification of the body , ( F )
AMPC	Hebrews	9	14	How much more surely shall the blood of Christ , Who [ b ] by virtue of [ His ] eternal Spirit [ His own preexistent [ c ] divine personality ] has offered Himself as an unblemished sacrifice to God , purify our consciences from dead works and lifeless observances to serve the [ ever ] living God ?
AMPC	Hebrews	9	15	[ Christ , the Messiah ] is therefore the Negotiator and Mediator of an [ entirely ] new agreement ( testament , covenant ) , so that those who are called and offered it may receive the fulfillment of the promised everlasting inheritance—since a death has taken place which rescues and delivers and redeems them from the transgressions committed under the [ old ] first agreement .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a [ last ] will and testament involved , the death of the one who made it must be established ,
AMPC	Hebrews	9	17	For a will and testament is valid and takes effect only at death , since it has no force or legal power as long as the one who made it is alive .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	18	So even the [ old ] first covenant ( God ’ s will ) was not inaugurated and ratified and put in force without the shedding of blood .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	19	For when every command of the Law had been read out by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of slain calves and goats , together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop , and sprinkled both the Book ( the roll of the Law and covenant ) itself and all the people ,
AMPC	Hebrews	9	20	Saying these words : This is the blood that seals and ratifies the agreement ( the testament , the covenant ) which God commanded [ me to deliver to ] you . ( G )
AMPC	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the [ sacred ] vessels and appliances used in [ divine ] worship .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	22	[ In fact ] under the Law almost everything is purified by means of blood , and without the shedding of blood there is neither release from sin and its guilt nor the remission of the due and merited punishment for sins .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	23	By such means , therefore , it was necessary for the [ earthly ] copies of the heavenly things to be purified , but the actual heavenly things themselves [ required far ] better and nobler sacrifices than these .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ ( the Messiah ) has not entered into a sanctuary made with [ human ] hands , only a copy and pattern and type of the true one , but [ He has entered ] into heaven itself , now to appear in the [ very ] presence of God on our behalf .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	25	Nor did He [ enter into the heavenly sanctuary to ] offer Himself regularly again and again , as the high priest enters the [ Holy of ] Holies every year with blood not his own .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	26	For then would He often have had to suffer [ over and over again ] since the foundation of the world . But as it now is , He has once for all at the consummation and close of the ages appeared to put away and abolish sin by His sacrifice [ of Himself ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	9	27	And just as it is appointed for [ all ] men once to die , and after that the [ certain ] judgment ,
AMPC	Hebrews	9	28	Even so it is that Christ , having been offered to take upon Himself and bear as a burden the sins of many once and [ d ] once for all , will appear a second time , not to carry any burden of sin nor to deal with sin , but to bring to full salvation those who are [ eagerly , constantly , and patiently ] waiting for and expecting Him .

AMPC	Hebrews	10	10	And in accordance with this will [ of God ] , we have been made holy ( consecrated and sanctified ) through the offering made once for all of the body of Jesus Christ ( the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	2	For if it were otherwise , would [ these sacrifices ] not have stopped being offered ? Since the worshipers had [ a ] once for all been cleansed , they would no longer have any guilt or consciousness of sin .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	3	But [ as it is ] these sacrifices annually bring a fresh remembrance of sins [ to be atoned for ] ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	4	Because the blood of bulls and goats is powerless to take sins away .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	5	Hence , when He [ Christ ] entered into the world , He said , Sacrifices and offerings You have not desired , but instead You have made ready a body for Me [ to offer ] ;
AMPC	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sin offerings You have taken no delight .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , Behold , here I am , coming to do Your will , O God— [ to fulfill ] what is written of Me in the volume of the Book . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	8	When He said just before , You have neither desired , nor have You taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings—all of which are offered according to the Law—
AMPC	Hebrews	10	9	He then went on to say , Behold , [ here ] I am , coming to do Your will . Thus He does away with and annuls the first ( former ) order [ as a means of expiating sin ] so that He might inaugurate and establish the second ( latter ) order . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	11	Furthermore , every [ human ] priest stands [ at his altar of service ] ministering daily , offering the same sacrifices over and over again , which never are able to strip [ from every side of us ] the sins [ that envelop us ] and take them away—
AMPC	Hebrews	10	12	Whereas this One [ Christ ] , after He had offered a single sacrifice for our sins [ that shall avail ] for all time , sat down at the right hand of God ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	13	Then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool beneath His feet . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	14	For by a single offering He has forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made holy .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	15	And also the Holy Spirit adds His testimony to us [ in confirmation of this ] . For having said ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	16	This is the agreement ( testament , covenant ) that I will set up and conclude with them after those days , says the Lord : I will imprint My laws upon their hearts , and I will inscribe them on their minds ( on their inmost thoughts and understanding ) ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	17	He then goes on to say , And their sins and their lawbreaking I will remember no more . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is absolute remission ( forgiveness and cancellation of the penalty ) of these [ sins and lawbreaking ] , there is no longer any offering made to atone for sin .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , brethren , since we have full freedom and confidence to enter into the [ Holy of ] Holies [ by the power and virtue ] in the blood of Jesus ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	20	By this fresh ( new ) and living way which He initiated and dedicated and opened for us through the separating curtain ( veil of the Holy of Holies ) , that is , through His flesh ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	21	And since we have [ such ] a great and wonderful and noble Priest [ Who rules ] over the house of God ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	22	Let us all come forward and draw near with true ( honest and sincere ) hearts in unqualified assurance and absolute conviction engendered by faith ( by [ b ] that leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) , having our hearts sprinkled and purified from a guilty ( evil ) conscience and our bodies cleansed with pure water .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	23	So let us seize and hold fast and retain without wavering the [ c ] hope we cherish and confess and our acknowledgement of it , for He Who promised is reliable ( sure ) and faithful to His word .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider and give [ d ] attentive , continuous care to watching over one another , studying how we may stir up ( stimulate and incite ) to love and helpful deeds and noble activities ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking or neglecting to assemble together [ as believers ] , as is the habit of some people , but admonishing ( warning , urging , and encouraging ) one another , and all the more faithfully as you see the day approaching .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	26	For if we go on deliberately and willingly sinning after once acquiring the knowledge of the Truth , there is no longer any sacrifice left to atone for [ our ] sins [ no further offering to which to look forward ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	27	[ There is nothing left for us then ] but a kind of awful and fearful prospect and expectation of divine judgment and the fury of burning wrath and indignation which will consume those who put themselves in opposition [ to God ] . ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	28	Any person who has violated and [ thus ] rejected and set at naught the Law of Moses is put to death without pity or mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses . ( F )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	29	How much worse ( sterner and heavier ) punishment do you suppose he will be judged to deserve who has spurned and [ thus ] trampled underfoot the Son of God , and who has considered the covenant blood by which he was consecrated common and unhallowed , thus profaning it and insulting and outraging the [ Holy ] Spirit [ Who imparts ] grace ( the unmerited favor and blessing of God ) ? ( G )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him Who said , Vengeance is Mine [ retribution and the meting out of full justice rest with Me ] ; I will repay [ I will exact the compensation ] , says the Lord . And again , The Lord will judge and determine and solve and settle the cause and the cases of His people . ( H )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful ( formidable and terrible ) thing to incur the divine penalties and be cast into the hands of the living God !
AMPC	Hebrews	10	32	But be ever mindful of the days gone by in which , after you were first spiritually enlightened , you endured a great and painful struggle ,
AMPC	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes being yourselves a gazingstock , publicly exposed to insults and abuse and distress , and sometimes claiming fellowship and making common cause with others who were so treated .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	34	For you did sympathize and suffer along with those who were imprisoned , and you bore cheerfully the plundering of your belongings and the confiscation of your property , in the knowledge and consciousness that you yourselves had a better and lasting possession .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	35	Do not , therefore , fling away your fearless confidence , for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of steadfast patience and endurance , so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God , and thus receive and [ e ] carry away [ and enjoy to the full ] what is promised .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	37	For still a little while ( a very little while ) , and the Coming One will come and He will not delay .
AMPC	Hebrews	10	38	But the just shall live by faith [ My righteous servant shall live [ f ] by his conviction respecting man ’ s relationship to God and divine things , and holy fervor born of faith and conjoined with it ] ; and if he draws back and shrinks in fear , My soul has no delight or pleasure in him . ( I )
AMPC	Hebrews	10	39	But our way is not that of those who draw back to eternal misery ( perdition ) and are utterly destroyed , but we are of those who believe [ who cleave to and trust in and rely on God through Jesus Christ , the Messiah ] and by faith preserve the soul .

AMPC	Hebrews	11	11	Because of faith also Sarah herself received physical power to conceive a child , even when she was long past the age for it , because she considered [ God ] Who had given her the promise to be reliable and trustworthy and true to His word . ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	2	For by [ faith— [ b ] trust and holy fervor born of faith ] the men of old had divine testimony borne to them and obtained a good report .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the worlds [ during the successive ages ] were framed ( fashioned , put in order , and equipped for their intended purpose ) by the word of God , so that what we see was not made out of things which are visible .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	4	[ Prompted , actuated ] by faith Abel brought God a better and more acceptable sacrifice than Cain , because of which it was testified of him that he was righteous [ that he was upright and in right standing with God ] , and God bore witness by accepting and acknowledging his gifts . And though he died , yet [ through the incident ] he is still speaking . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	5	Because of faith Enoch was caught up and transferred to heaven , so that he did not have a glimpse of death ; and he was not found , because God had translated him . For even before he was taken to heaven , he received testimony [ still on record ] that he had pleased and been satisfactory to God . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him . For whoever would come near to God must [ necessarily ] believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him [ out ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	7	[ Prompted ] by faith Noah , being forewarned by God concerning events of which as yet there was no visible sign , took heed and diligently and reverently constructed and prepared an ark for the deliverance of his own family . By this [ his faith which relied on God ] he passed judgment and sentence on the world ’ s unbelief and became an heir and possessor of righteousness ( [ c ] that relation of being right into which God puts the person who has faith ) . ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	8	[ Urged on ] by faith Abraham , when he was called , obeyed and went forth to a place which he was destined to receive as an inheritance ; and he went , although he did not know or trouble his mind about where he was to go .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	9	[ Prompted ] by faith he dwelt as a temporary resident in the land which was designated in the promise [ of God , though he was like a stranger ] in a strange country , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , fellow heirs with him of the same promise . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	10	For he was [ waiting expectantly and confidently ] looking forward to the city which has fixed and firm foundations , whose Architect and Builder is God .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	12	So from one man , though he was physically as good as dead , there have sprung descendants whose number is as the stars of heaven and as countless as the innumerable sands on the seashore . ( F )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	13	These people all died controlled and sustained by their faith , but not having received the tangible fulfillment of [ God ’ s ] promises , only having seen it and greeted it from a great distance by faith , and all the while acknowledging and confessing that they were strangers and temporary residents and exiles upon the earth . ( G )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	14	Now those people who talk as they did show plainly that they are in search of a fatherland ( their own country ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking with [ homesick ] remembrance of that country from which they were emigrants , they would have found constant opportunity to return to it .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	16	But the truth is that they were yearning for and aspiring to a better and more desirable country , that is , a heavenly [ one ] . For that reason God is not ashamed to be called their God [ even to be surnamed their God—the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ] , for He has prepared a city for them . ( H )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when he was put to the test [ while the testing of his faith was [ d ] still in progress ] , [ e ] had already brought Isaac for an offering ; he who had gladly received and welcomed [ God ’ s ] promises was ready to sacrifice his only son , ( I )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	18	Of whom it was said , Through Isaac shall your descendants be reckoned . ( J )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	19	For he reasoned that God was able to raise [ him ] up even from among the dead . Indeed in the sense that Isaac was figuratively dead [ potentially sacrificed ] , he did [ actually ] receive him back from the dead .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	20	[ With eyes of ] faith Isaac , looking far into the future , invoked blessings upon Jacob and Esau . ( K )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	21	[ Prompted ] by faith Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of Joseph ’ s sons and bowed in prayer over the top of his staff . ( L )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	22	[ Actuated ] by faith Joseph , when nearing the end of his life , referred to [ the promise of God for ] the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his own bones . ( M )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	23	[ Prompted ] by faith Moses , after his birth , was kept concealed for three months by his parents , because they saw how comely the child was ; and they were not overawed and terrified by the king ’ s decree . ( N )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	24	[ Aroused ] by faith Moses , when he had grown to maturity and [ f ] become great , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter , ( O )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	25	Because he preferred to share the oppression [ suffer the hardships ] and bear the shame of the people of God rather than to have the fleeting enjoyment of a sinful life .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	26	He considered the contempt and abuse and shame [ borne for ] the Christ ( the Messiah Who was to come ) to be greater wealth than all the treasures of Egypt , for he looked forward and away to the reward ( recompense ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	27	[ Motivated ] by faith he left Egypt behind him , being unawed and undismayed by the wrath of the king ; for he never flinched but held staunchly to his purpose and endured steadfastly as one who gazed on Him Who is invisible . ( P )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	28	By faith ( simple trust and confidence in God ) he instituted and carried out the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood [ on the doorposts ] , so that the destroyer of the firstborn ( the angel ) might not touch those [ of the children of Israel ] . ( Q )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	29	[ Urged on ] by faith the people crossed the Red Sea as [ though ] on dry land , but when the Egyptians tried to do the same thing they were swallowed up [ by the sea ] . ( R )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	30	Because of faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encompassed for seven days [ by the Israelites ] . ( S )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	31	[ Prompted ] by faith Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed along with those who refused to believe and obey , because she had received the spies in peace [ without enmity ] . ( T )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I say further ? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the prophets , ( U )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	33	Who by [ the help of ] faith subdued kingdoms , administered justice , obtained promised blessings , closed the mouths of lions , ( V )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	34	Extinguished the power of raging fire , escaped the devourings of the sword , out of frailty and weakness won strength and became stalwart , even mighty and resistless in battle , routing alien hosts . ( W )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	35	[ Some ] women received again their dead by a resurrection . Others were tortured [ g ] to death with clubs , refusing to accept release [ offered on the terms of denying their faith ] , so that they might be resurrected to a better life . ( X )
AMPC	Hebrews	11	36	Others had to suffer the trial of mocking and scourging and even chains and imprisonment .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned to death ; they were lured with tempting offers [ to renounce their faith ] ; they were sawn asunder ; they were slaughtered by the sword ; [ while they were alive ] they had to go about wrapped in the skins of sheep and goats , utterly destitute , oppressed , cruelly treated—
AMPC	Hebrews	11	38	[ Men ] of whom the world was not worthy—roaming over the desolate places and the mountains , and [ living ] in caves and caverns and holes of the earth .
AMPC	Hebrews	11	39	And all of these , though they won divine approval by [ means of ] their faith , did not receive the fulfillment of what was promised ,
AMPC	Hebrews	11	40	Because God had us in mind and had something better and greater in view for us , so that they [ these heroes and heroines of faith ] should not come to perfection apart from us [ before we could join them ] .

AMPC	Hebrews	12	12	So then , brace up and reinvigorate and set right your slackened and weakened and drooping hands and strengthen your feeble and palsied and tottering knees , ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	2	Looking away [ from all that will distract ] to Jesus , Who is the Leader and the Source of our faith [ giving the first incentive for our belief ] and is also its Finisher [ bringing it to maturity and perfection ] . He , for the joy [ of obtaining the prize ] that was set before Him , endured the cross , despising and ignoring the shame , and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	3	Just think of Him Who endured from sinners such grievous opposition and bitter hostility against Himself [ reckon up and consider it all in comparison with your trials ] , so that you may not grow weary or exhausted , losing heart and relaxing and fainting in your minds .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet struggled and fought agonizingly against sin , nor have you yet resisted and withstood to the point of pouring out your [ own ] blood .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	5	And have you [ completely ] forgotten the divine word of appeal and encouragement in which you are reasoned with and addressed as sons ? My son , do not think lightly or scorn to submit to the correction and discipline of the Lord , nor lose courage and give up and faint when you are reproved or corrected by Him ;
AMPC	Hebrews	12	6	For the Lord corrects and disciplines everyone whom He loves , and He punishes , even scourges , every son whom He accepts and welcomes to His heart and cherishes .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	7	You must submit to and endure [ correction ] for discipline ; God is dealing with you as with sons . For what son is there whom his father does not [ thus ] train and correct and discipline ?
AMPC	Hebrews	12	8	Now if you are exempt from correction and left without discipline in which all [ of God ’ s children ] share , then you are illegitimate offspring and not true sons [ at all ] . ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	9	Moreover , we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we yielded [ to them ] and respected [ them for training us ] . Shall we not much more cheerfully submit to the Father of spirits and so [ truly ] live ?
AMPC	Hebrews	12	10	For [ our earthly fathers ] disciplined us for only a short period of time and chastised us as seemed proper and good to them ; but He disciplines us for our certain good , that we may become sharers in His own holiness .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	11	For the time being no discipline brings joy , but seems grievous and painful ; but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it [ a harvest of fruit which consists in righteousness—in conformity to God ’ s will in purpose , thought , and action , resulting in right living and right standing with God ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	13	And cut through and make firm and plain and smooth , straight paths for your feet [ yes , make them safe and upright and happy paths that go in the right direction ] , so that the lame and halting [ limbs ] may not be put out of joint , but rather may be cured .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	14	Strive to live in peace with everybody and pursue that consecration and holiness without which no one will [ ever ] see the Lord .
AMPC	Hebrews	12	15	Exercise foresight and be on the watch to look [ after one another ] , to see that no one falls back from and fails to secure God ’ s grace ( His unmerited favor and spiritual blessing ) , in order that no root of resentment ( rancor , bitterness , or hatred ) shoots forth and causes trouble and bitter torment , and the many become contaminated and defiled by it—
AMPC	Hebrews	12	16	That no one may become guilty of sexual vice , or become a profane ( godless and sacrilegious ) person as Esau did , who sold his own birthright for a single meal . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	17	For you understand that later on , when he wanted [ to regain title to ] his inheritance of the blessing , he was rejected ( disqualified and set aside ) , for he could find no opportunity to repair by repentance [ what he had done , no chance to recall the choice he had made ] , although he sought for it carefully with [ bitter ] tears . ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come [ as did the Israelites in the wilderness ] to a [ material ] mountain that can be touched , [ a mountain ] that is ablaze with fire , and to gloom and darkness and a raging storm ,
AMPC	Hebrews	12	19	And to the blast of a trumpet and a voice whose words make the listeners beg that nothing more be said to them . ( F )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not bear the command that was given : If even a wild animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned to death . ( G )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	21	In fact , so awful and terrifying was the [ phenomenal ] sight that Moses said , I am terrified ( aghast and trembling with fear ) . ( H )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	22	But rather , you have come to Mount Zion , even to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to countless multitudes of angels in festal gathering ,
AMPC	Hebrews	12	23	And to the church ( assembly ) of the Firstborn who are registered [ as citizens ] in heaven , and to the God Who is Judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous ( the redeemed in heaven ) who have been made perfect ,
AMPC	Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus , the Mediator ( Go-between , Agent ) of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood which speaks [ of mercy ] , a better and nobler and more gracious message than the blood of Abel [ which cried out for vengeance ] . ( I )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	25	So see to it that you do not reject Him or refuse to listen to and heed Him Who is speaking [ to you now ] . For if they [ the Israelites ] did not escape when they refused to listen and heed Him Who warned and divinely instructed them [ here ] on earth [ revealing with heavenly warnings His will ] , how much less shall we escape if we reject and turn our backs on Him Who cautions and admonishes [ us ] from heaven ?
AMPC	Hebrews	12	26	Then [ at Mount Sinai ] His voice shook the earth , but now He has given a promise : Yet once more I will shake and make tremble not only the earth but also the [ starry ] heavens . ( J )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	27	Now this expression , Yet once more , indicates the final removal and transformation of all [ that can be ] shaken—that is , of that which has been created—in order that what can not be shaken may remain and continue . ( K )
AMPC	Hebrews	12	28	Let us therefore , receiving a kingdom that is firm and stable and can not be shaken , offer to God pleasing service and acceptable worship , with modesty and pious care and godly fear and awe ;
AMPC	Hebrews	12	29	For our God [ is indeed ] a consuming fire . ( L ) Copyright ©

AMPC	Hebrews	13	13	Let us then go forth [ from all that would prevent us ] to Him outside the camp [ at Calvary ] , bearing the contempt and abuse and shame with Him . ( E )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	2	Do not forget or neglect or refuse to extend hospitality to strangers [ in the brotherhood—being friendly , cordial , and gracious , sharing the comforts of your home and doing your part generously ] , for through it some have entertained angels without knowing it . ( A )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	3	Remember those who are in prison as if you were their fellow prisoner , and those who are ill-treated , since you also are liable to bodily sufferings .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be held in honor ( esteemed worthy , precious , of great price , and especially dear ) in all things . And thus let the marriage bed be undefiled ( kept undishonored ) ; for God will judge and punish the unchaste [ all guilty of sexual vice ] and adulterous .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	5	Let your [ a ] character or moral disposition be free from love of money [ including greed , avarice , lust , and craving for earthly possessions ] and be satisfied with your present [ circumstances and with what you have ] ; for He [ God ] [ b ] Himself has said , I will not in any way fail you nor [ c ] give you up nor leave you without support . [ I will ] not , [ d ] [ I will ] not , [ I will ] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor [ e ] let [ you ] down ( [ f ] relax My hold on you ) ! [ [ g ] Assuredly not ! ] ( B )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	6	So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say , The Lord is my Helper ; I will not be seized with alarm [ I will not fear or dread or be terrified ] . What can man do to me ? ( C )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders and superiors in authority [ for it was they ] who brought to you the Word of God . Observe attentively and consider their manner of living ( the outcome of their well-spent lives ) and imitate their faith ( [ h ] their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and Ruler of all things , the Provider and Bestower of eternal salvation through Christ , and their [ i ] leaning of the entire human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) is [ always ] the same , yesterday , today , [ yes ] and forever ( to the ages ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be carried about by different and varied and alien teachings ; for it is good for the heart to be established and ennobled and strengthened by means of grace ( God ’ s favor and spiritual blessing ) and not [ to be devoted to ] foods [ rules of diet and ritualistic meals ] , which bring no [ spiritual ] benefit or profit to those who observe them .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve and [ j ] worship in the tabernacle have no right to eat .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	11	For when the blood of animals is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin , the victims ’ bodies are burned outside the limits of the camp . ( D )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also suffered and died outside the [ city ’ s ] gate in order that He might purify and consecrate the people through [ the shedding of ] His own blood and set them apart as holy [ for God ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	14	For here we have no permanent city , but we are looking for the one which is to come .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	15	Through Him , therefore , let us constantly and at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise , which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify His name . ( F )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	16	Do not forget or neglect to do kindness and good , to be generous and distribute and contribute to the needy [ of the church [ k ] as embodiment and proof of fellowship ] , for such sacrifices are pleasing to God .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them [ continually recognizing their authority over you ] , for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare , as men who will have to render an account [ of their trust ] . [ Do your part to ] let them do this with gladness and not with sighing and groaning , for that would not be profitable to you [ either ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	18	Keep praying for us , for we are convinced that we have a good ( clear ) conscience , that we want to walk uprightly and live a noble life , acting honorably and in complete honesty in all things .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	19	And I beg of you [ to pray for us ] the more earnestly , in order that I may be restored to you the sooner .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	20	Now may the God of peace [ Who is the Author and the Giver of peace ] , Who brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus , that great Shepherd of the sheep , by the blood [ that sealed , ratified ] the everlasting agreement ( covenant , testament ) , ( G )
AMPC	Hebrews	13	21	Strengthen ( complete , perfect ) and make you what you ought to be and equip you with everything good that you may carry out His will ; [ while He Himself ] works in you and accomplishes that which is pleasing in His sight , through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) ; to Whom be the glory forever and ever ( to the ages of the ages ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	22	I call on you , brethren , to listen patiently and bear with this message of exhortation and admonition and encouragement , for I have written to you briefly .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	23	Notice that our brother Timothy has been released [ from prison ] . If he comes here soon , I will see you along with him .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	24	Give our greetings to all of your spiritual leaders and to all of the saints ( God ’ s consecrated believers ) . The Italian Christians send you their greetings [ also ] .
AMPC	Hebrews	13	25	Grace ( God ’ s favor and spiritual blessing ) be with you all . Amen ( so be it ) .

AMPC	James	1	1	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes scattered abroad [ among the Gentiles in the dispersion ] : Greetings ( [ a ] rejoice ) !
AMPC	James	1	2	Consider it wholly joyful , my brethren , whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations .
AMPC	James	1	3	Be assured and understand that the trial and proving of your faith bring out endurance and steadfastness and patience .
AMPC	James	1	4	But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work , so that you may be [ people ] perfectly and fully developed [ with no defects ] , lacking in nothing .
AMPC	James	1	5	If any of you is deficient in wisdom , let him ask of [ b ] the giving God [ Who gives ] to everyone liberally and ungrudgingly , without reproaching or faultfinding , and it will be given him .
AMPC	James	1	6	Only it must be in faith that he asks with no wavering ( no hesitating , no doubting ) . For the one who wavers ( hesitates , doubts ) is like the billowing surge out at sea that is blown hither and thither and tossed by the wind .
AMPC	James	1	7	For truly , let not such a person imagine that he will receive anything [ he asks for ] from the Lord ,
AMPC	James	1	8	[ For being as he is ] a man of two minds ( hesitating , dubious , irresolute ) , [ he is ] unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything [ he thinks , feels , decides ] .
AMPC	James	1	9	Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his elevation [ as a Christian , called to the true riches and to be an heir of God ] ,
AMPC	James	1	10	And the rich [ person ought to glory ] in being humbled [ by being shown his human frailty ] , because like the flower of the grass he will pass away .
AMPC	James	1	11	For the sun comes up with a scorching heat and parches the grass ; its flower falls off and its beauty fades away . Even so will the rich man wither and die in the midst of his pursuits . ( A )
AMPC	James	1	12	Blessed ( happy , [ c ] to be envied ) is the man who is patient under trial and stands up under temptation , for when he has stood the test and been approved , he will receive [ the victor ’ s ] crown of life which God has promised to those who love Him .
AMPC	James	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted , I am tempted from God ; for God is incapable of being tempted by [ what is ] evil and He Himself tempts no one .
AMPC	James	1	14	But every person is tempted when he is drawn away , enticed and baited by his own evil desire ( lust , passions ) .
AMPC	James	1	15	Then the evil desire , when it has conceived , gives birth to sin , and sin , when it is fully matured , brings forth death .
AMPC	James	1	16	Do not be misled , my beloved brethren .
AMPC	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect ( [ d ] free , large , full ) gift is from above ; it comes down from the Father of all [ that gives ] light , in [ the shining of ] Whom there can be no variation [ rising or setting ] or shadow cast by His turning [ as in an eclipse ] .
AMPC	James	1	18	And it was of His own [ free ] will that He gave us birth [ as sons ] by [ His ] Word of Truth , so that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures [ a sample of what He created to be consecrated to Himself ] .
AMPC	James	1	19	Understand [ this ] , my beloved brethren . Let every man be quick to hear [ a ready listener ] , slow to speak , slow to take offense and to get angry .
AMPC	James	1	20	For man ’ s anger does not promote the righteousness God [ wishes and requires ] .
AMPC	James	1	21	So get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness , and in a humble ( gentle , modest ) spirit receive and welcome the Word which implanted and rooted [ in your hearts ] contains the power to save your souls .
AMPC	James	1	22	But be doers of the Word [ obey the message ] , and not merely listeners to it , betraying yourselves [ into deception by reasoning contrary to the Truth ] .
AMPC	James	1	23	For if anyone only listens to the Word without obeying it and being a doer of it , he is like a man who looks carefully at his [ own ] natural face in a mirror ;
AMPC	James	1	24	For he thoughtfully observes himself , and then goes off and promptly forgets what he was like .
AMPC	James	1	25	But he who looks carefully into the faultless law , the [ law ] of liberty , and is faithful to it and perseveres in looking into it , being not a heedless listener who forgets but an active doer [ who obeys ] , he shall be blessed in his doing ( his life of obedience ) .
AMPC	James	1	26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious ( piously observant of the external duties of his faith ) and does not bridle his tongue but deludes his own heart , this person ’ s religious service is worthless ( futile , barren ) .
AMPC	James	1	27	External [ e ] religious worship [ [ f ] religion as it is expressed in outward acts ] that is pure and unblemished in the sight of God the Father is this : to visit and help and care for the orphans and widows in their affliction and need , and to keep oneself unspotted and uncontaminated from the world .

AMPC	James	2	2	For if a person comes into your congregation whose hands are adorned with gold rings and who is wearing splendid apparel , and also a poor [ man ] in shabby clothes comes in ,
AMPC	James	2	3	And you pay special attention to the one who wears the splendid clothes and say to him , Sit here in this preferable seat ! while you tell the poor [ man ] , Stand there ! or , Sit there on the floor at my feet !
AMPC	James	2	4	Are you not discriminating among your own and becoming critics and judges with wrong motives ?
AMPC	James	2	5	Listen , my beloved brethren : Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and in their position as believers and to inherit the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him ?
AMPC	James	2	6	But you [ in contrast ] have insulted ( humiliated , dishonored , and shown your contempt for ) the poor . Is it not the rich who domineer over you ? Is it not they who drag you into the law courts ?
AMPC	James	2	7	Is it not they who slander and blaspheme that precious name by which you are distinguished and called [ the name of Christ invoked in baptism ] ?
AMPC	James	2	8	If indeed you [ really ] fulfill the royal Law in accordance with the Scripture , You shall love your neighbor as [ you love ] yourself , you do well . ( A )
AMPC	James	2	9	But if you show servile regard ( prejudice , favoritism ) for people , you commit sin and are rebuked and convicted by the Law as violators and offenders .
AMPC	James	2	10	For whosoever keeps the Law [ as a ] whole but stumbles and offends in one [ single instance ] has become guilty of [ breaking ] all of it .
AMPC	James	2	11	For He Who said , You shall not commit adultery , also said , You shall not kill . If you do not commit adultery but do kill , you have become guilty of transgressing the [ whole ] Law . ( B )
AMPC	James	2	12	So speak and so act as [ people should ] who are to be judged under the law of liberty [ the moral instruction given by Christ , especially about love ] .
AMPC	James	2	13	For to him who has shown no mercy the judgment [ will be ] merciless , but mercy [ full of glad confidence ] exults victoriously over judgment .
AMPC	James	2	14	What is the use ( profit ) , my brethren , for anyone to profess to have faith if he has no [ good ] works [ to show for it ] ? Can [ such ] faith save [ his soul ] ?
AMPC	James	2	15	If a brother or sister is poorly clad and lacks food for each day ,
AMPC	James	2	16	And one of you says to him , Good-bye ! Keep [ yourself ] warm and well fed , without giving him the necessities for the body , what good does that do ?
AMPC	James	2	17	So also faith , if it does not have works ( deeds and actions of obedience to back it up ) , by itself is destitute of power ( inoperative , dead ) .
AMPC	James	2	18	But someone will say [ to you then ] , You [ say you ] have faith , and I have [ good ] works . Now you show me your [ alleged ] faith apart from any [ good ] works [ if you can ] , and I by [ good ] works [ of obedience ] will show you my faith .
AMPC	James	2	19	You believe that God is one ; you do well . So do the demons believe and shudder [ in terror and horror such as [ a ] make a man ’ s hair stand on end and contract the surface of his skin ] !
AMPC	James	2	20	Are you willing to be shown [ proof ] , you foolish ( unproductive , spiritually deficient ) fellow , that faith apart from [ good ] works is inactive and ineffective and worthless ?
AMPC	James	2	21	Was not our forefather Abraham [ shown to be ] justified ( made acceptable to God ) by [ his ] works when he brought to the altar as an offering his [ own ] son Isaac ? ( C )
AMPC	James	2	22	You see that [ his ] faith was cooperating with his works , and [ his ] faith was completed and reached its supreme expression [ when he implemented it ] by [ good ] works .
AMPC	James	2	23	And [ so ] the Scripture was fulfilled that says , Abraham believed in ( adhered to , trusted in , and relied on ) God , and this was accounted to him as righteousness ( as conformity to God ’ s will in thought and deed ) , and he was called God ’ s friend . ( D )
AMPC	James	2	24	You see that a man is justified ( pronounced righteous before God ) through what he does and not alone through faith [ through works of obedience as well as by what he believes ] .
AMPC	James	2	25	So also with Rahab the harlot—was she not shown to be justified ( pronounced righteous before God ) by [ good ] deeds when she took in the scouts ( spies ) and sent them away by a different route ? ( E )
AMPC	James	2	26	For as the human body apart from the spirit is lifeless , so faith apart from [ its ] works of obedience is also dead . Footnotes - James 2:19 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . Copyright ©

AMPC	James	3	3	If we set bits in the horses ’ mouths to make them obey us , we can turn their whole bodies about .
AMPC	James	3	2	For we all often stumble and fall and offend in many things . And if anyone does not offend in speech [ never says the wrong things ] , he is a fully developed character and a perfect man , able to control his whole body and to curb his entire nature .
AMPC	James	3	4	Likewise , look at the ships : though they are so great and are driven by rough winds , they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines .
AMPC	James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member , and it can boast of great things . See how much wood or how great a forest a tiny spark can set ablaze !
AMPC	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire . [ The tongue is a ] world of wickedness set among our members , contaminating and depraving the whole body and setting on fire the wheel of birth ( the cycle of man ’ s nature ) , being itself ignited by hell ( Gehenna ) .
AMPC	James	3	7	For every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and sea animal , can be tamed and has been tamed by human genius ( nature ) .
AMPC	James	3	8	But the human tongue can be tamed by no man . It is a restless ( undisciplined , irreconcilable ) evil , full of deadly poison .
AMPC	James	3	9	With it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse men who were made in God ’ s likeness !
AMPC	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing . These things , my brethren , ought not to be so .
AMPC	James	3	11	Does a fountain send forth [ simultaneously ] from the same opening fresh water and bitter ?
AMPC	James	3	12	Can a fig tree , my brethren , bear olives , or a grapevine figs ? Neither can a salt spring furnish fresh water .
AMPC	James	3	13	Who is there among you who is wise and intelligent ? Then let him by his noble living show forth his [ good ] works with the [ unobtrusive ] humility [ which is the proper attribute ] of true wisdom .
AMPC	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy ( envy ) and contention ( rivalry , selfish ambition ) in your hearts , do not pride yourselves on it and thus be in defiance of and false to the Truth .
AMPC	James	3	15	This [ superficial ] wisdom is not such as comes down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual ( animal ) , even devilish ( demoniacal ) .
AMPC	James	3	16	For wherever there is jealousy ( envy ) and contention ( rivalry and selfish ambition ) , there will also be confusion ( unrest , disharmony , rebellion ) and all sorts of evil and vile practices .
AMPC	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is first of all pure ( undefiled ) ; then it is peace-loving , courteous ( considerate , gentle ) . [ It is willing to ] yield to reason , full of compassion and good fruits ; it is wholehearted and straightforward , impartial and unfeigned ( free from doubts , wavering , and insincerity ) .
AMPC	James	3	18	And the harvest of righteousness ( of conformity to God ’ s will in thought and deed ) is [ the fruit of the seed ] sown in peace by those who work for and make peace [ in themselves and in others , that peace which means concord , agreement , and harmony between individuals , with undisturbedness , in a peaceful mind free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts ] .

AMPC	James	4	4	You [ are like ] unfaithful wives [ having illicit love affairs with the world and breaking your marriage vow to God ] ! Do you not know that being the world ’ s friend is being God ’ s enemy ? So whoever chooses to be a friend of the world takes his stand as an enemy of God .
AMPC	James	4	2	You are jealous and covet [ what others have ] and your desires go unfulfilled ; [ so ] you become murderers . [ To hate is to murder as far as your hearts are concerned . ] You burn with envy and anger and are not able to obtain [ the gratification , the contentment , and the happiness that you seek ] , so you fight and war . You do not have , because you do not ask . ( A )
AMPC	James	4	3	[ Or ] you do ask [ God for them ] and yet fail to receive , because you ask with wrong purpose and evil , selfish motives . Your intention is [ when you get what you desire ] to spend it in sensual pleasures .
AMPC	James	4	5	Or do you suppose that the Scripture is speaking to no purpose that says , The Spirit Whom He has caused to dwell in us yearns over us and He yearns for the Spirit [ to be welcome ] with a jealous love ? ( B )
AMPC	James	4	6	But He gives us more and more grace ( [ a ] power of the Holy Spirit , to meet this evil tendency and all others fully ) . That is why He says , God sets Himself against the proud and haughty , but gives grace [ continually ] to the lowly ( those who are humble enough to receive it ) . ( C )
AMPC	James	4	7	So be subject to God . Resist the devil [ stand firm against him ] , and he will flee from you .
AMPC	James	4	8	Come close to God and He will come close to you . [ Recognize that you are ] sinners , get your soiled hands clean ; [ realize that you have been disloyal ] wavering individuals with divided interests , and purify your hearts [ of your spiritual adultery ] .
AMPC	James	4	9	[ As you draw near to God ] be deeply penitent and grieve , even weep [ over your disloyalty ] . Let your laughter be turned to grief and your mirth to dejection and heartfelt shame [ for your sins ] .
AMPC	James	4	10	Humble yourselves [ feeling very insignificant ] in the presence of the Lord , and He will exalt you [ He will lift you up and make your lives significant ] .
AMPC	James	4	11	[ My ] brethren , do not speak evil about or accuse one another . He that maligns a brother or judges his brother is maligning and criticizing the Law and judging the Law . But if you judge the Law , you are not a practicer of the Law but a censor and judge [ of it ] .
AMPC	James	4	12	One only is the Lawgiver and Judge Who is able to save and to destroy [ the One Who has the absolute power of life and death ] . [ But you ] who are you that [ you presume to ] pass judgment on your neighbor ?
AMPC	James	4	13	Come now , you who say , Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a city and spend a year there and carry on our business and make money .
AMPC	James	4	14	Yet you do not know [ the least thing ] about what may happen tomorrow . What is the nature of your life ? You are [ really ] but a wisp of vapor ( a puff of smoke , a mist ) that is visible for a little while and then disappears [ into thin air ] .
AMPC	James	4	15	You ought instead to say , If the Lord is willing , we shall live and we shall do this or that [ thing ] .
AMPC	James	4	16	But as it is , you boast [ falsely ] in your presumption and your self-conceit . All such boasting is wrong .
AMPC	James	4	17	So any person who knows what is right to do but does not do it , to him it is sin . Footnotes - James 4:6 Adam Clarke , The Holy Bible with A Commentary . Copyright ©

AMPC	James	5	5	[ Here ] on earth you have abandoned yourselves to soft ( prodigal ) living and to [ the pleasures of ] self-indulgence and self-gratification . You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
AMPC	James	5	2	Your abundant wealth has rotted and is ruined , and your [ many ] garments have become moth-eaten .
AMPC	James	5	3	Your gold and silver are completely rusted through , and their rust will be testimony against you and it will devour your flesh as if it were fire . You have heaped together treasure for the last days .
AMPC	James	5	4	[ But ] look ! [ Here are ] the wages that you have withheld by fraud from the laborers who have reaped your fields , crying out [ for vengeance ] ; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of the Lord of hosts .
AMPC	James	5	6	You have condemned and have murdered the righteous ( innocent man ) , [ while ] he offers no resistance to you .
AMPC	James	5	7	So be patient , brethren , [ as you wait ] till the coming of the Lord . See how the farmer waits expectantly for the precious harvest from the land . [ See how ] he keeps up his patient [ vigil ] over it until it receives the early and late rains .
AMPC	James	5	8	So you also must be patient . Establish your hearts [ strengthen and confirm them in the final certainty ] , for the coming of the Lord is very near .
AMPC	James	5	9	Do not complain , brethren , against one another , so that you [ yourselves ] may not be judged . Look ! The Judge is [ already ] standing at the very door .
AMPC	James	5	10	[ As ] an example of suffering and ill-treatment together with patience , brethren , take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord [ as His messengers ] .
AMPC	James	5	11	You know how we call those blessed ( happy ) who were steadfast [ who endured ] . You have heard of the endurance of Job , and you have seen the Lord ’ s [ purpose and how He richly blessed him in the ] end , inasmuch as the Lord is full of pity and compassion and tenderness and mercy . ( A )
AMPC	James	5	12	But above all [ things ] , my brethren , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath ; but let your yes be [ a simple ] yes , and your no be [ a simple ] no , so that you may not sin and fall under condemnation .
AMPC	James	5	13	Is anyone among you afflicted ( ill-treated , suffering evil ) ? He should pray . Is anyone glad at heart ? He should sing praise [ to God ] .
AMPC	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? He should call in the church elders ( the spiritual guides ) . And they should pray over him , anointing him with oil in the Lord ’ s name .
AMPC	James	5	15	And the prayer [ that is ] of faith will save him who is sick , and the Lord will restore him ; and if he has committed sins , he will be forgiven .
AMPC	James	5	16	Confess to one another therefore your faults ( your slips , your false steps , your offenses , your sins ) and pray [ also ] for one another , that you may be healed and restored [ to a spiritual tone of mind and heart ] . The earnest ( heartfelt , continued ) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [ dynamic in its working ] .
AMPC	James	5	17	Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have [ with feelings , affections , and a constitution like ours ] ; and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain , and no rain fell on the earth for three years and six months . ( B )
AMPC	James	5	18	And [ then ] he prayed again and the heavens supplied rain and the land produced its crops [ as usual ] . ( C )
AMPC	James	5	19	[ My ] brethren , if anyone among you strays from the Truth and falls into error and another [ person ] brings him back [ to God ] ,
AMPC	James	5	20	Let the [ latter ] one be sure that whoever turns a sinner from his evil course will save [ that one ’ s ] soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins [ [ a ] procure the pardon of the many sins committed by the convert ] .

AMPC	1%20Peter	1	2	Who were chosen and foreknown by God the Father and consecrated ( sanctified , made holy ) by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) and to be sprinkled with [ His ] blood : May grace ( spiritual blessing ) and peace be given you in increasing abundance [ that spiritual peace to be [ a ] realized in and through Christ , [ b ] freedom from fears , agitating passions , and moral conflicts ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	3	Praised ( honored , blessed ) be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) ! By His boundless mercy we have been born again to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	4	[ Born anew ] into an inheritance which is beyond the reach of change and decay [ imperishable ] , unsullied and unfading , reserved in heaven for you ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	5	Who are being guarded ( garrisoned ) by God ’ s power through [ your ] faith [ till you fully inherit that [ c ] final ] salvation that is ready to be revealed [ for you ] in the last time .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	6	[ You should ] be exceedingly glad on this account , though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	7	So that [ the genuineness ] of your faith may be tested , [ your faith ] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire . [ This proving of your faith is intended ] to redound to [ your ] praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) is revealed .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	8	Without having seen Him , you love Him ; though you do not [ even ] now see Him , you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious ( triumphant , heavenly ) joy .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	9	[ At the same time ] you receive the result ( outcome , consummation ) of your faith , the salvation of your souls .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets , who prophesied of the grace ( divine blessing ) which was intended for you , searched and inquired earnestly about this salvation .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	11	They sought [ to find out ] to whom or when this was to come which the Spirit of Christ working within them was indicating when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow [ them ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	12	It was then disclosed to them that the services they were rendering were not meant for themselves and their period of time , but for you . [ It is these very ] things which have now already been made known plainly to you by those who preached the good news ( the Gospel ) to you by the [ same ] Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Into these things [ the very ] angels long to look !
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	13	So brace up your minds ; be sober ( circumspect , morally alert ) ; set your hope wholly and unchangeably on the grace ( divine favor ) that is coming to you when Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) is revealed .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	14	[ Live ] as children of obedience [ to God ] ; do not conform yourselves to the evil desires [ that governed you ] in your former ignorance [ when you did not know the requirements of the Gospel ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	15	But as the One Who called you is holy , you yourselves also be holy in all your conduct and manner of living .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	16	For it is written , You shall be holy , for I am holy . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	17	And if you call upon Him as [ your ] Father Who judges each one impartially according to what he does , [ then ] you should conduct yourselves with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence [ on the earth , whether long or short ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	18	You must know ( recognize ) that you were redeemed ( ransomed ) from the useless ( fruitless ) way of living inherited by tradition from [ your ] forefathers , not with corruptible things [ such as ] silver and gold ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	19	But [ you were purchased ] with the precious blood of Christ ( the Messiah ) , like that of a [ sacrificial ] lamb without blemish or spot .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	20	It is true that He was chosen and foreordained ( destined and foreknown for it ) before the foundation of the world , but He was brought out to public view ( made manifest ) in these last days ( at the end of the times ) for the sake of you .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	21	Through Him you believe in ( adhere to , rely on ) God , Who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him honor and glory , so that your faith and hope are [ centered and rest ] in God .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	22	Since by your obedience to the Truth through the [ Holy ] Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the brethren , [ see that you ] love one another fervently from a pure heart .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	23	You have been regenerated ( born again ) , not from a mortal [ d ] origin ( [ e ] seed , sperm ) , but from one that is immortal by the ever living and lasting Word of God .
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	24	For all flesh ( mankind ) is like grass , and all its glory ( honor ) like [ the ] flower of grass . The grass withers and the flower drops off ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	1	25	But the Word of the Lord ( [ f ] divine instruction , the Gospel ) endures forever . And this Word is the good news which was preached to you . ( B ) Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter 2:25 Literal translation . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	2	Like newborn babies you should crave ( thirst for , earnestly desire ) the pure ( unadulterated ) spiritual milk , that by it you may be nurtured and grow unto [ completed ] salvation ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	3	Since you have [ already ] tasted the goodness and kindness of the Lord . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	4	Come to Him [ then , to that ] Living Stone which men [ a ] tried and threw away , but which is chosen [ and ] precious in God ’ s sight . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	5	[ Come ] and , like living stones , be yourselves built [ into ] a spiritual house , for a holy ( dedicated , consecrated ) priesthood , to offer up [ those ] spiritual sacrifices [ that are ] acceptable and pleasing to God through Jesus Christ .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	6	For thus it stands in Scripture : Behold , I am laying in Zion a chosen ( [ b ] honored ) , precious chief Cornerstone , and he who believes in Him [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] shall never be [ c ] disappointed or put to shame . ( C )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	7	To you then who believe ( who adhere to , trust in , and rely on Him ) is the preciousness ; but for those who disbelieve [ it is true ] , The [ very ] Stone which the builders rejected has become the main Cornerstone , ( D )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	8	And , A Stone that will cause stumbling and a Rock that will give [ men ] offense ; they stumble because they disobey and disbelieve [ God ’ s ] Word , as those [ who reject Him ] were destined ( appointed ) to do .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a dedicated nation , [ God ’ s ] own [ d ] purchased , special people , that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light . ( E )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	10	Once you were not a people [ at all ] , but now you are God ’ s people ; once you were unpitied , but now you are pitied and have received mercy . ( F )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	11	Beloved , I implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles [ in this world ] to abstain from the sensual urges ( the evil desires , the passions of the flesh , your lower nature ) that wage war against the soul .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	12	Conduct yourselves properly ( honorably , righteously ) among the Gentiles , so that , although they may slander you as evildoers , [ yet ] they may by witnessing your good deeds [ come to ] glorify God in the day of inspection [ [ e ] when God shall look upon you wanderers as a pastor or shepherd looks over his flock ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	13	Be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the Lord , whether it be to the emperor as supreme ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	14	Or to governors as sent by him to bring vengeance ( punishment , justice ) to those who do wrong and to encourage those who do good service .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	15	For it is God ’ s will and intention that by doing right [ your good and honest lives ] should silence ( muzzle , gag ) the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticisms of foolish persons .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	16	[ Live ] as free people , [ yet ] without employing your freedom as a pretext for wickedness ; but [ live at all times ] as servants of God .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	17	Show respect for all men [ treat them honorably ] . Love the brotherhood ( the Christian fraternity of which Christ is the Head ) . Reverence God . Honor the emperor .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	18	[ You who are ] household servants , be submissive to your masters with all [ proper ] respect , not only to those who are kind and considerate and reasonable , but also to those who are surly ( overbearing , unjust , and crooked ) .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	19	For one is regarded favorably ( is approved , acceptable , and thankworthy ) if , as in the sight of God , he endures the pain of unjust suffering .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	20	[ After all ] what [ f ] kind of glory [ is there in it ] if , when you do wrong and are punished for it , you take it patiently ? But if you bear patiently with suffering [ which results ] when you do right and that is undeserved , it is acceptable and pleasing to God .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	21	For even to this were you called [ it is inseparable from your vocation ] . For Christ also suffered for you , leaving you [ His personal ] example , so that you should follow in His footsteps .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	22	He was guilty of no sin , neither was deceit ( guile ) ever found on His lips . ( G )
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	23	When He was reviled and insulted , He did not revile or offer insult in return ; [ when ] He was abused and suffered , He made no threats [ of vengeance ] ; but he trusted [ Himself and everything ] to Him Who judges fairly .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	24	He personally bore our sins in His [ own ] body on the tree [ g ] [ as on an altar and offered Himself on it ] , that we might die ( cease to exist ) to sin and live to righteousness . By His wounds you have been healed .
AMPC	1%20Peter	2	25	For you were going astray like [ so many ] sheep , but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian ( [ h ] the Bishop ) of your souls . ( H ) Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Peter	3	3	Let not yours be the [ merely ] external adorning with [ elaborate ] [ b ] interweaving and knotting of the hair , the wearing of jewelry , or changes of clothes ;
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	2	When they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves , together with your [ a ] reverence [ for your husband ; you are to feel for him all that reverence includes : to respect , defer to , revere him—to honor , esteem , appreciate , prize , and , in the human sense , to adore him , that is , to admire , praise , be devoted to , deeply love , and enjoy your husband ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	4	But let it be the inward adorning and beauty of the hidden person of the heart , with the incorruptible and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit , which [ is not anxious or wrought up , but ] is very precious in the sight of God .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	5	For it was thus that the pious women of old who hoped in God were [ accustomed ] to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husbands [ adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	6	It was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham [ following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by ] calling him lord ( master , leader , authority ) . And you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you [ not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	7	In the same way you married men should live considerately with [ your wives ] , with an [ c ] intelligent recognition [ of the marriage relation ] , honoring the woman as [ physically ] the weaker , but [ realizing that you ] are joint heirs of the grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) of life , in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off . [ Otherwise you can not pray effectively . ]
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all [ of you ] should be of one and the same mind ( united in spirit ) , sympathizing [ with one another ] , loving [ each other ] as brethren [ of one household ] , compassionate and courteous ( tenderhearted and humble ) .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	9	Never return evil for evil or insult for insult ( scolding , tongue-lashing , berating ) , but on the contrary blessing [ praying for their welfare , happiness , and protection , and truly pitying and loving them ] . For know that to this you have been called , that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [ from God—that you may obtain a blessing as heirs , bringing welfare and happiness and protection ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	10	For let him who wants to enjoy life and see good days [ good—whether apparent or not ] keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from guile ( treachery , deceit ) .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	11	Let him turn away from wickedness and shun it , and let him do right . Let him search for peace ( harmony ; undisturbedness from fears , agitating passions , and moral conflicts ) and seek it eagerly . [ Do not merely desire peaceful relations with God , with your fellowmen , and with yourself , but pursue , go after them ! ]
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous ( those who are upright and in right standing with God ) , and His ears are attentive to their prayer . But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil [ to oppose them , to frustrate , and defeat them ] . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	13	Now who is there to hurt you if you are [ d ] zealous followers of that which is good ?
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	14	But even in case you should suffer for the sake of righteousness , [ you are ] blessed ( happy , to be envied ) . Do not dread or be afraid of their threats , nor be disturbed [ by their opposition ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	15	But in your hearts set Christ apart as holy [ and acknowledge Him ] as Lord . Always be ready to give a logical defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope that is in you , but do it courteously and respectfully . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	16	[ And see to it that ] your conscience is entirely clear ( [ e ] unimpaired ) , so that , when you are falsely accused as evildoers , those who threaten you abusively and revile your right behavior in Christ may come to be ashamed [ of slandering your good lives ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	17	For [ it is ] better to suffer [ unjustly ] for doing right , if that should be God ’ s will , than to suffer [ justly ] for doing wrong .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ [ the Messiah Himself ] died for sins once [ f ] for all , the Righteous for the unrighteous ( the Just for the unjust , the Innocent for the guilty ) , that He might bring us to God . In His human body He was put to death , but He was made alive in the spirit ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	19	In which He went and preached to the spirits in prison ,
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	20	[ The souls of those ] who long before in the days of Noah had been disobedient , when God ’ s patience waited during the building of the ark in which a few [ people ] , actually eight in number , were saved through water . ( C )
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	21	And baptism , which is a figure [ of their deliverance ] , does now also save you [ from inward questionings and fears ] , not by the removing of outward body filth [ bathing ] , but by [ providing you with ] the answer of a good and clear conscience ( inward cleanness and peace ) before God [ because you are demonstrating what you believe to be yours ] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
AMPC	1%20Peter	3	22	[ And He ] has now entered into heaven and is at the right hand of God , with [ all ] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20Peter	4	4	They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation , and they abuse [ you ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	2	So that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living by [ his ] human appetites and desires , but [ he lives ] for what God wills .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time that is past already suffices for doing what the Gentiles like to do—living [ as you have done ] in shameless , insolent wantonness , in lustful desires , drunkenness , reveling , drinking bouts and abominable , lawless idolatries .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to give an account to Him Who is ready to judge and pass sentence on the living and the dead .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	6	For this is why the good news ( the Gospel ) was preached [ [ d ] in their lifetime ] even to the dead , that though judged in fleshly bodies as men are , they might live in the spirit as God does .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	7	But the end and culmination of all things has now come near ; keep sound minded and self-restrained and alert therefore for [ the practice of ] prayer .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another , for love covers a multitude of sins [ forgives and [ e ] disregards the offenses of others ] . ( A )
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	9	Practice hospitality to one another ( those of the household of faith ) . [ Be hospitable , be a lover of strangers , with brotherly affection for the unknown guests , the foreigners , the poor , and all others who come your way who are of Christ ’ s body . ] And [ in each instance ] do it ungrudgingly ( cordially and graciously , without complaining but as representing Him ) .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	10	As each of you has received a gift ( a particular spiritual talent , a gracious divine endowment ) , employ it for one another as [ befits ] good trustees of God ’ s many-sided grace [ faithful stewards of the [ f ] extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to Christians by unmerited favor ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	11	Whoever speaks , [ let him do it as one who utters ] oracles of God ; whoever renders service , [ let him do it ] as with the strength which God furnishes [ g ] abundantly , so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . To Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever ( through endless ages ) . Amen ( so be it ) .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , do not be amazed and bewildered at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test your quality , as though something strange ( unusual and alien to you and your position ) were befalling you .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	13	But insofar as you are sharing Christ ’ s sufferings , rejoice , so that when His glory [ full of radiance and splendor ] is revealed , you may also rejoice with triumph [ exultantly ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are censured and suffer abuse [ because you bear ] the name of Christ , blessed [ are you—happy , fortunate , [ h ] to be envied , [ i ] with life-joy , and satisfaction in God ’ s favor and salvation , regardless of your outward condition ] , because the Spirit of glory , the Spirit of God , is resting upon you . On their part He is blasphemed , but on your part He is glorified . ( B )
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or any sort of criminal , or as a mischief-maker ( a meddler ) in the affairs of others [ infringing on their rights ] .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	16	But if [ one is ill-treated and suffers ] as a Christian [ which he is contemptuously called ] , let him not be ashamed , but give glory to God that he is [ deemed worthy to suffer ] in this name .
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	17	For the time [ has arrived ] for judgment to begin with the household of God ; and if it begins with us , what will [ be ] the end of those who do not respect or believe or obey the good news ( the Gospel ) of God ?
AMPC	1%20Peter	4	18	And if the righteous are barely saved , what will become of the godless and wicked ? ( C )

AMPC	1%20Peter	5	5	Likewise , you who are younger and of lesser rank , be subject to the elders ( the ministers and spiritual guides of the church ) — [ giving them due respect and yielding to their counsel ] . Clothe ( apron ) yourselves , all of you , with humility [ as the garb of a servant , [ b ] so that its covering can not possibly be stripped from you , with freedom from pride and arrogance ] toward one another .

AMPC	1%20Peter	5	8	Be well balanced ( temperate , sober of mind ) , be vigilant and cautious at all times ; for that enemy of yours , the devil , roams around like a lion roaring [ [ f ] in fierce hunger ] , seeking someone to seize upon and devour .

AMPC	2%20Peter	1	1	Simon Peter , a servant and apostle ( special messenger ) of Jesus Christ , to those who have received ( obtained an equal privilege of ) like precious faith with ourselves in and through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ :
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	3	For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that [ are requisite and suited ] to life and godliness , through the [ [ d ] full , personal ] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence ( virtue ) .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	4	By means of these He has bestowed on us His precious and exceedingly great promises , so that through them you may escape [ by flight ] from the moral decay ( rottenness and corruption ) that is in the world because of covetousness ( lust and greed ) , and become sharers ( partakers ) of the divine nature .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	5	For this very reason , [ e ] adding your diligence [ to the divine promises ] , employ every effort in [ f ] exercising your faith to develop virtue ( excellence , resolution , Christian energy ) , and in [ exercising ] virtue [ develop ] knowledge ( intelligence ) ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	6	And in [ exercising ] knowledge [ develop ] self-control , and in [ exercising ] self-control [ develop ] steadfastness ( patience , endurance ) , and in [ exercising ] steadfastness [ develop ] godliness ( piety ) ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	7	And in [ exercising ] godliness [ develop ] brotherly affection , and in [ exercising ] brotherly affection [ develop ] Christian love .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	8	For as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you , they will keep [ you ] from being idle or unfruitful unto the [ [ g ] full personal ] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	9	For whoever lacks these qualities is blind , [ [ h ] spiritually ] shortsighted , [ i ] seeing only what is near to him , and has become oblivious [ to the fact ] that he was cleansed from his old sins .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	10	Because of this , brethren , be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure ( to ratify , to strengthen , to make steadfast ) your calling and election ; for if you do this , you will never stumble or fall .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	11	Thus there will be richly and abundantly provided for you entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	12	So I intend always to remind you about these things , although indeed you know them and are firm in the truth that [ you ] now [ hold ] .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	13	I think it right , as long as I am in this tabernacle ( tent , body ) , to stir you up by way of remembrance ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	14	Since I know that the laying aside of this body of mine will come speedily , as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	15	Moreover , I will diligently endeavor [ to see to it ] that [ even ] after my departure ( decease ) you may be able at all times to call these things to mind .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	16	For we were not following cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty ( grandeur , authority of sovereign power ) .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	17	For when He was invested with honor and glory from God the Father and a voice was borne to Him by the [ splendid ] Majestic Glory [ in the bright cloud that overshadowed Him , saying ] , This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased and delight ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	18	We [ actually ] heard this voice borne out of heaven , for we were together with Him on the holy mountain .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	19	And we have the prophetic word [ made ] firmer still . You will do well to pay close attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dismal ( squalid and dark ) place , until the day breaks through [ the gloom ] and the Morning Star rises ( [ j ] comes into being ) in your hearts .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	20	[ Yet ] first [ you must ] understand this , that no prophecy of Scripture is [ a matter ] of any personal or private or special interpretation ( loosening , solving ) .
AMPC	2%20Peter	1	21	For no prophecy ever originated because some man willed it [ to do so—it never came by human impulse ] , but men spoke from God who were borne along ( moved and impelled ) by the Holy Spirit . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Peter	2	3	And in their covetousness ( lust , greed ) they will exploit you with false ( cunning ) arguments . From of old the sentence [ of condemnation ] for them has not been idle ; their destruction ( eternal misery ) has not been asleep .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	4	For God did not [ even ] spare angels that sinned , but cast them into hell , delivering them to be kept there in pits of gloom till the judgment and their doom .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	5	And He spared not the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a preacher of righteousness , with seven other persons , when He brought a flood upon the world of ungodly [ people ] . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	6	And He condemned to ruin and extinction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah , reducing them to ashes [ and thus ] set them forth as an example to those who would be ungodly ; ( B )
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	7	And He rescued righteous Lot , greatly worn out and distressed by the wanton ways of the ungodly and lawless— ( C )
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	8	For that just man , living [ there ] among them , tortured his righteous soul every day with what he saw and heard of [ their ] unlawful and wicked deeds—
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	9	Now if [ all these things are true , then be sure ] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations and trials , and how to keep the ungodly under chastisement until the day of judgment and doom ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	10	And particularly those who walk after the flesh and indulge in the lust of polluting passion and scorn and despise authority . Presumptuous [ and ] daring [ self-willed and self-loving creatures ] ! They scoff at and revile dignitaries ( glorious ones ) without trembling ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	11	Whereas [ even ] angels , though superior in might and power , do not bring a defaming charge against them before the Lord .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	12	But these [ people ] ! Like unreasoning beasts , mere creatures of instinct , born [ only ] to be captured and destroyed , railing at things of which they are ignorant , they shall utterly perish in their [ own ] corruption [ in their destroying they shall surely be destroyed ] ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	13	Being destined to receive [ punishment as ] the reward of [ their ] unrighteousness [ suffering wrong as the hire for their wrongdoing ] . They count it a delight to revel in the daytime [ living luxuriously and delicately ] . They are blots and blemishes , reveling in their [ a ] deceptions and carousing together [ even ] as they feast with you .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	14	They have eyes full of harlotry , insatiable for sin . They beguile and bait and lure away unstable souls . Their hearts are trained in covetousness ( lust , greed ) , [ they are ] children of a curse [ [ b ] exposed to cursing ] !
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	15	Forsaking the straight road they have gone astray ; they have followed the way of Balaam [ the son ] of Beor , who loved the reward of wickedness . ( D )
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	16	But he was rebuked for his own transgression when a dumb beast of burden spoke with human voice and checked the prophet ’ s madness . ( E )
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	17	These are springs without water and mists driven along before a tempest , for whom is reserved forever the gloom of darkness .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	18	For uttering loud boasts of folly , they beguile and lure with lustful desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	19	They promise them liberty , when they themselves are the slaves of depravity and defilement—for by whatever anyone is made inferior or worse or is overcome , to that [ person or thing ] he is enslaved .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through [ the full , personal ] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they again become entangled in them and are overcome , their last condition is worse [ for them ] than the first .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	21	For never to have obtained a [ full , personal ] knowledge of the way of righteousness would have been better for them than , having obtained [ such knowledge ] , to turn back from the holy commandment which was [ verbally ] delivered to them .
AMPC	2%20Peter	2	22	There has befallen them the thing spoken of in the true proverb , The dog turns back to his own vomit , and , The sow is washed only to wallow again in the mire . ( F ) Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20Peter	3	3	To begin with , you must know and understand this , that scoffers ( mockers ) will come in the last days with scoffing , [ people who ] walk after their own fleshly desires
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	4	And say , Where is the promise of His coming ? For since the forefathers fell asleep , all things have continued exactly as they did from the beginning of creation .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	5	For they willfully overlook and forget this [ fact ] , that the heavens [ came into ] existence long ago by the word of God , and the earth also which was formed out of water and by means of water ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	6	Through which the world that then [ existed ] was deluged with water and perished . ( A )
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	7	But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up ( reserved ) for fire , being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	8	Nevertheless , do not let this one fact escape you , beloved , that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day . ( B )
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises , according to some people ’ s conception of slowness , but He is long-suffering ( extraordinarily patient ) toward you , not desiring that any should perish , but that all should turn to repentance .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief , and then the heavens will vanish ( pass away ) with a thunderous crash , and the [ [ a ] material ] elements [ of the universe ] will be dissolved with fire , and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	11	Since all these things are thus [ b ] in the process of being dissolved , what kind of person ought [ each of ] you to be [ in the meanwhile ] in consecrated and holy behavior and devout and godly qualities ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	12	While you wait and earnestly long for ( expect and hasten ) the coming of the day of God by reason of which the flaming heavens will be dissolved , and the [ [ c ] material ] elements [ of the universe ] will flare and melt with fire ? ( C )
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	13	But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise , in which righteousness ( uprightness , freedom from sin , and right standing with God ) is to abide . ( D )
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	14	So , beloved , since you are expecting these things , be eager to be found by Him [ at His coming ] without spot or blemish and at peace [ in serene confidence , [ d ] free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts ] .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	15	And consider that the long-suffering of our Lord [ [ e ] His slowness in avenging wrongs and judging the world ] is salvation ( [ f ] that which is conducive to the soul ’ s safety ) , even as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the spiritual insight given him ,
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	16	Speaking of this as he does in all of his letters . There are some things in those [ epistles of Paul ] that are difficult to understand , which the ignorant and unstable twist and misconstrue to their own [ g ] utter destruction , just as [ they distort and misinterpret ] the rest of the Scriptures .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	17	Let me warn you therefore , beloved , that knowing these things beforehand , you should be on your guard , lest you be carried away by the error of lawless and wicked [ persons and ] fall from your own [ present ] firm condition [ your own steadfastness of mind ] .
AMPC	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in grace ( undeserved favor , spiritual strength ) and [ h ] recognition and knowledge and understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . To Him [ be ] glory ( honor , majesty , and splendor ) both now and to the day of eternity . Amen ( so be it ) ! Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20John	1	2	And the Life [ [ b ] an aspect of His being ] was revealed ( made manifest , demonstrated ) , and we saw [ as eyewitnesses ] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life , the eternal Life [ [ c ] in Him ] Who already existed with the Father and Who [ actually ] was made visible ( was revealed ) to us [ His followers ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	3	What we have seen and [ ourselves ] heard , we are also telling you , so that you too may [ d ] realize and enjoy fellowship as partners and partakers with us . And [ this ] fellowship that we have [ which is a [ e ] distinguishing mark of Christians ] is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) .
AMPC	1%20John	1	4	And we are now writing these things to you so that our joy [ in seeing you included ] may be full [ and [ f ] your joy may be complete ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	5	And this is the message [ the message of [ g ] promise ] which we have heard from Him and now are reporting to you : God is Light , and there is no darkness in Him at all [ [ h ] no , not in any way ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	6	[ So ] if we say we are partakers together and enjoy fellowship with Him when we live and move and are walking about in darkness , we are [ both ] speaking falsely and do not live and practice the Truth [ which the Gospel presents ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	7	But if we [ really ] are living and walking in the Light , as He [ Himself ] is in the Light , we have [ true , unbroken ] fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses ( removes ) us from all sin and guilt [ keeps us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	8	If we say we have no sin [ refusing to admit that we are sinners ] , we delude and lead ourselves astray , and the Truth [ which the Gospel presents ] is not in us [ does not dwell in our hearts ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	9	If we [ freely ] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins , He is faithful and just ( true to His own nature and promises ) and will forgive our sins [ dismiss our lawlessness ] and [ continuously ] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [ everything not in conformity to His will in purpose , thought , and action ] .
AMPC	1%20John	1	10	If we say ( claim ) we have not sinned , we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar , and His Word is not in us [ the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts ] . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20John	2	2	And He [ [ a ] that same Jesus Himself ] is the propitiation ( the atoning sacrifice ) for our sins , and not for ours alone but also for [ the sins of ] the whole world .
AMPC	1%20John	2	3	And this is how we may discern [ [ b ] daily , by experience ] that we are coming to know Him [ to perceive , recognize , understand , and become better acquainted with Him ] : if we keep ( bear in mind , observe , practice ) His teachings ( precepts , commandments ) .
AMPC	1%20John	2	4	Whoever says , I know Him [ I perceive , recognize , understand , and am acquainted with Him ] but fails to keep and obey His commandments ( teachings ) is a liar , and the Truth [ [ c ] of the Gospel ] is not in him .
AMPC	1%20John	2	5	But he who keeps ( treasures ) His Word [ who bears in mind His precepts , who observes His message in its entirety ] , truly in him has the love of and for God been perfected ( completed , reached maturity ) . By this we may perceive ( know , recognize , and be sure ) that we are in Him :
AMPC	1%20John	2	6	Whoever says he abides in Him ought [ as [ d ] a personal debt ] to walk and conduct himself in the same way in which He walked and conducted Himself .
AMPC	1%20John	2	7	Beloved , I am writing you no new commandment , but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning ; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [ the [ e ] doctrine of salvation through Christ ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	8	Yet I am writing you a new commandment , which is true ( is realized ) in Him and in you , because the darkness ( [ f ] moral blindness ) is clearing away and the true Light ( [ g ] the revelation of God in Christ ) is already shining .
AMPC	1%20John	2	9	Whoever says he is in the Light and [ yet ] hates his brother [ Christian , [ h ] born-again child of God his Father ] is in darkness even until now .
AMPC	1%20John	2	10	Whoever loves his brother [ believer ] abides ( lives ) in the Light , and in It or in him there is no occasion for stumbling or cause for error or sin .
AMPC	1%20John	2	11	But he who hates ( detests , despises ) his brother [ [ i ] in Christ ] is in darkness and walking ( living ) in the dark ; he is straying and does not perceive or know where he is going , because the darkness has blinded his eyes .
AMPC	1%20John	2	12	I am writing to you , little children , because for His name ’ s sake your sins are forgiven [ pardoned through His name and on account of confessing His name ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	13	I am writing to you , fathers , because you have come to know ( recognize , be aware of , and understand ) Him Who [ has existed ] from the beginning . I am writing to you , young men , because you have been victorious over the wicked [ one ] . I write to you , [ j ] boys ( lads ) , because you have come to know ( recognize and be aware ) of the Father .
AMPC	1%20John	2	14	I write to you , fathers , because you have come to know ( recognize , be conscious of , and understand ) Him Who [ has existed ] from the beginning . I write to you , young men , because you are strong and vigorous , and the Word of God is [ always ] abiding in you ( in your hearts ) , and you have been victorious over the wicked one .
AMPC	1%20John	2	15	Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world . If anyone loves the world , love for the Father is not in him .
AMPC	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh [ craving for sensual gratification ] and the lust of the eyes [ greedy longings of the mind ] and the pride of life [ assurance in one ’ s own resources or in the stability of earthly things ] —these do not come from the Father but are from the world [ itself ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	17	And the world passes away and disappears , and with it the forbidden cravings ( the passionate desires , the lust ) of it ; but he who does the will of God and carries out His purposes in his life abides ( remains ) forever .
AMPC	1%20John	2	18	[ k ] Boys ( lads ) , it is the last time ( hour , the end of this age ) . And as you have heard that the antichrist [ he who will oppose Christ in the guise of Christ ] is coming , even now many antichrists have arisen , which confirms our belief that it is the final ( the end ) time .
AMPC	1%20John	2	19	They went out from our number , but they did not [ really ] belong to us ; for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us . But [ they withdrew ] that it might be plain that they all are not of us .
AMPC	1%20John	2	20	But you have been anointed by [ you hold a sacred appointment from , you have been given an unction from ] the Holy One , and you all know [ the Truth ] or you know all things .
AMPC	1%20John	2	21	I write to you not because you are ignorant and do not perceive and know the Truth , but because you do perceive and know it , and [ know positively ] that nothing false ( no deception , no lie ) is of the Truth .
AMPC	1%20John	2	22	Who is [ such a ] liar as he who denies that Jesus is the Christ ( the Messiah ) ? He is the antichrist ( the antagonist of Christ ) , who [ [ l ] habitually ] denies and refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son .
AMPC	1%20John	2	23	No one who [ [ m ] habitually ] denies ( disowns ) the Son [ n ] even has the Father . Whoever confesses ( acknowledges and has ) the Son has the Father also .
AMPC	1%20John	2	24	As for you , keep in your hearts what you have heard from the beginning . If what you heard from the first dwells and remains in you , then you will dwell in the Son and in the Father [ always ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	25	And this is what He Himself has promised us—the life , the eternal [ life ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	26	I write this to you with reference to those who would deceive you [ seduce and lead you astray ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	27	But as for you , the anointing ( the sacred appointment , the unction ) which you received from Him abides [ [ o ] permanently ] in you ; [ so ] then you have no need that anyone should instruct you . But just as His anointing teaches you concerning everything and is true and is no falsehood , so you must abide in ( live in , never depart from ) Him [ being [ p ] rooted in Him , knit to Him ] , just as [ His anointing ] has taught you [ to do ] .
AMPC	1%20John	2	28	And now , little children , abide ( live , remain [ q ] permanently ) in Him , so that when He is made visible , we may have and enjoy perfect confidence ( boldness , assurance ) and not be ashamed and shrink from Him at His coming .
AMPC	1%20John	2	29	If you know ( perceive and are sure ) that He [ Christ ] is [ absolutely ] righteous [ conforming to the Father ’ s will in purpose , thought , and action ] , you may also know ( be sure ) that everyone who does righteously [ and is therefore in like manner conformed to the divine will ] is born ( begotten ) of Him [ [ r ] God ] .

AMPC	1%20John	3	3	And everyone who has this hope [ resting ] on Him cleanses ( purifies ) himself just as He is pure ( chaste , undefiled , guiltless ) .
AMPC	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , we are [ even here and ] now God ’ s children ; it is not yet disclosed ( made clear ) what we shall be [ hereafter ] , but we know that when He comes and is manifested , we shall [ [ b ] as God ’ s children ] resemble and be like Him , for we shall see Him [ c ] just as He [ really ] is .
AMPC	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who commits ( practices ) sin is guilty of lawlessness ; for [ that is what ] sin is , lawlessness ( the breaking , violating of God ’ s law by transgression or neglect—being unrestrained and unregulated by His commands and His will ) .
AMPC	1%20John	3	5	You know that He appeared in visible form and became Man to take away [ upon Himself ] sins , and in Him there is no sin [ [ d ] essentially and forever ] .
AMPC	1%20John	3	6	No one who abides in Him [ who lives and remains [ e ] in communion with and in obedience to Him—deliberately , knowingly , and [ f ] habitually ] commits ( practices ) sin . No one who [ habitually ] sins has either seen or known Him [ recognized , perceived , or understood Him , or has had an experiential acquaintance with Him ] .
AMPC	1%20John	3	7	[ g ] Boys ( lads ) , let no one deceive and lead you astray . He who practices righteousness [ who is upright , conforming to the divine will in purpose , thought , and action , living a consistently conscientious life ] is righteous , even as He is righteous .
AMPC	1%20John	3	8	[ But ] he who commits sin [ who practices evildoing ] is of the devil [ takes his character from the evil one ] , for the devil has sinned ( violated the divine law ) from the beginning . The reason the Son of God was made manifest ( visible ) was to undo ( destroy , loosen , and dissolve ) the works the devil [ has done ] .
AMPC	1%20John	3	9	No one born ( begotten ) of God [ deliberately , knowingly , and [ h ] habitually ] practices sin , for God ’ s nature abides in him [ His principle of life , the divine sperm , remains permanently within him ] ; and he can not practice sinning because he is born ( begotten ) of God .
AMPC	1%20John	3	10	By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His children and who take their nature from the devil and are his children : no one who does not practice righteousness [ who does not conform to God ’ s will in purpose , thought , and action ] is of God ; neither is anyone who does not love his brother ( his fellow [ i ] believer in Christ ) .
AMPC	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message ( the announcement ) which you have heard from the first , that we should love one another ,
AMPC	1%20John	3	12	[ And ] not be like Cain who [ took his nature and got his motivation ] from the evil one and slew his brother . And why did he slay him ? Because his deeds ( activities , works ) were wicked and malicious and his brother ’ s were righteous ( virtuous ) .
AMPC	1%20John	3	13	Do not be surprised and wonder , brethren , that the world detests and pursues you with hatred .
AMPC	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren ( our fellow Christians ) . He who does not love abides ( remains , is [ j ] held and kept continually ) in [ spiritual ] death .
AMPC	1%20John	3	15	Anyone who hates ( abominates , detests ) his brother [ in Christ ] is [ at heart ] a murderer , and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding ( [ k ] persevering ) within him .
AMPC	1%20John	3	16	By this we come to know ( progressively to recognize , to perceive , to understand ) the [ essential ] love : that He laid down His [ own ] life for us ; and we ought to lay [ our ] lives down for [ those who are our ] brothers [ [ l ] in Him ] .
AMPC	1%20John	3	17	But if anyone has this world ’ s goods ( resources for sustaining life ) and sees his brother and [ m ] fellow believer in need , yet closes his heart of compassion against him , how can the love of God live and remain in him ?
AMPC	1%20John	3	18	Little children , let us not love [ merely ] in theory or in speech but in deed and in truth ( in practice and in sincerity ) .
AMPC	1%20John	3	19	By this we shall come to know ( perceive , recognize , and understand ) that we are of the Truth , and can reassure ( quiet , conciliate , and pacify ) our hearts in His presence ,
AMPC	1%20John	3	20	Whenever our hearts in [ [ n ] tormenting ] self-accusation make us feel guilty and condemn us . [ For [ o ] we are in God ’ s hands . ] For He is above and greater than our consciences ( our hearts ) , and He knows ( perceives and understands ) everything [ nothing is hidden from Him ] .
AMPC	1%20John	3	21	And , beloved , if our consciences ( our hearts ) do not accuse us [ if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us ] , we have confidence ( complete assurance and boldness ) before God ,
AMPC	1%20John	3	22	And we receive from Him whatever we ask , because we [ [ p ] watchfully ] obey His orders [ observe His suggestions and injunctions , follow His plan for us ] and [ [ q ] habitually ] practice what is pleasing to Him .
AMPC	1%20John	3	23	And this is His order ( His command , His injunction ) : that we should believe in ( put our faith and trust in and adhere to and rely on ) the name of His Son Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and that we should love one another , just as He has commanded us .
AMPC	1%20John	3	24	All who keep His commandments [ who obey His orders and follow His plan , live and continue to live , to stay and ] abide in Him , and He in them . [ [ r ] They let Christ be a home to them and they are the home of Christ . ] And by this we know and understand and have the proof that He [ really ] lives and makes His home in us : by the [ Holy ] Spirit Whom He has given us .

This [ [ c ] nonconfession ] is the [ spirit ] of the antichrist , [ of ] which you heard that it was coming , and now it is already in the world .
AMPC	1%20John	4	5	They proceed from the world and are of the world ; therefore it is out of the world [ its [ d ] whole economy morally considered ] that they speak , and the world listens ( pays attention ) to them .
AMPC	1%20John	4	6	We are [ children ] of God . Whoever is learning to know God [ progressively to perceive , recognize , and understand God by observation and experience , and to [ e ] get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him ] listens to us ; and he who is not of God does not listen or pay attention to us . By this we know ( recognize ) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error .
AMPC	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , let us love one another , for love is ( springs ) from God ; and he who loves [ his fellowmen ] is begotten ( born ) of God and is coming [ progressively ] to know and understand God [ to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him ] .
AMPC	1%20John	4	8	He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [ does not and never did know Him ] , for God is love .
AMPC	1%20John	4	9	In this the love of God was made manifest ( displayed ) where we are concerned : in that God sent His Son , the only begotten or [ f ] unique [ Son ] , into the world so that we might live through Him .
AMPC	1%20John	4	10	In this is love : not that we loved God , but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation ( the atoning sacrifice ) for our sins .
AMPC	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if God loved us so [ very much ] , we also ought to love one another .
AMPC	1%20John	4	12	No man has at any time [ yet ] seen God . But if we love one another , God abides ( lives and remains ) in us and His love ( that love which is essentially His ) is brought to completion ( to its full maturity , runs its full course , is perfected ) in us !
AMPC	1%20John	4	13	By this we come to know ( perceive , recognize , and understand ) that we abide ( live and remain ) in Him and He in us : because He has given ( imparted ) to us of His [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMPC	1%20John	4	14	And [ besides ] we ourselves have seen ( have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated ) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [ as the ] Savior of the world .
AMPC	1%20John	4	15	Anyone who confesses ( acknowledges , owns ) that Jesus is the Son of God , God abides ( lives , makes His home ) in him and he [ abides , lives , makes his home ] in God .
AMPC	1%20John	4	16	And we know ( understand , recognize , are conscious of , by observation and by experience ) and believe ( adhere to and put faith in and rely on ) the love God cherishes for us . God is love , and he who dwells and continues in love dwells and continues in God , and God dwells and continues in him .
AMPC	1%20John	4	17	In this [ union and communion with Him ] love is brought to completion and attains perfection with us , that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [ with assurance and boldness to face Him ] , because as He is , so are we in this world .
AMPC	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love [ dread does not exist ] , but full-grown ( complete , perfect ) love [ g ] turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror ! For fear [ h ] brings with it the thought of punishment , and [ so ] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [ is not yet grown into love ’ s complete perfection ] .
AMPC	1%20John	4	19	We love Him , because He first loved us .
AMPC	1%20John	4	20	If anyone says , I love God , and hates ( detests , abominates ) his brother [ [ i ] in Christ ] , he is a liar ; for he who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , can not love God , Whom he has not seen .
AMPC	1%20John	4	21	And this command ( charge , order , injunction ) we have from Him : that he who loves God shall love his brother [ [ j ] believer ] also . Footnotes -

AMPC	1%20John	5	1	John 5:13 Brooke F. Westcott , cited by Speaker ’ s Commentary . Copyright ©
AMPC	1%20John	5	5	Who is it that is victorious over [ that conquers ] the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on that fact ] ?
AMPC	1%20John	5	2	By this we come to know ( recognize and understand ) that we love the children of God : when we love God and obey His commands ( orders , charges ) — [ when we keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and His teaching ] .
AMPC	1%20John	5	3	For the [ true ] love of God is this : that we do His commands [ keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching ] . And these orders of His are not irksome ( burdensome , oppressive , or grievous ) .
AMPC	1%20John	5	4	For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world ; and this is the victory that conquers the world , even our faith .
AMPC	1%20John	5	6	This is He Who came by ( with ) water and blood [ [ a ] His baptism and His death ] , Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) —not by ( in ) the water only , but by ( in ) the water and the blood . And it is the [ Holy ] Spirit Who bears witness , because the [ Holy ] Spirit is the Truth .
AMPC	1%20John	5	7	So there are three witnesses [ b ] in heaven : the Father , the Word and the Holy Spirit , and these three are One ;
AMPC	1%20John	5	8	and there are three witnesses on the earth : the Spirit , the water , and the blood ; and these three agree [ are in unison ; their testimony coincides ] .
AMPC	1%20John	5	9	If we accept [ as we do ] the testimony of men [ if we are willing to take human authority ] , the testimony of God is greater ( of stronger authority ) , for this is the testimony of God , even the witness which He has borne regarding His Son .
AMPC	1%20John	5	10	He who believes in the Son of God [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] has the testimony [ possesses this divine attestation ] within himself . He who does not believe God [ in this way ] has made Him out to be and represented Him as a liar , because he has not believed ( put his faith in , adhered to , and relied on ) the evidence ( the testimony ) that God has borne regarding His Son .
AMPC	1%20John	5	11	And this is that testimony ( that evidence ) : God gave us eternal life , and this life is in His Son .
AMPC	1%20John	5	12	He who possesses the Son has that life ; he who does not possess the Son of God does not have that life .
AMPC	1%20John	5	13	I write this to you who believe in ( adhere to , trust in , and rely on ) the name of the Son of God [ in [ c ] the peculiar services and blessings conferred by Him on men ] , so that you may know [ with settled and absolute knowledge ] that you [ already ] have life , [ d ] yes , eternal life .
AMPC	1%20John	5	14	And this is the confidence ( the assurance , the privilege of boldness ) which we have in Him : [ we are sure ] that if we ask anything ( make any request ) according to His will ( in agreement with His own plan ) , He listens to and hears us .
AMPC	1%20John	5	15	And if ( since ) we [ positively ] know that He listens to us in whatever we ask , we also know [ with settled and absolute knowledge ] that we have [ granted us as our present possessions ] the requests made of Him .
AMPC	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees his brother [ believer ] committing a sin that does not [ lead to ] death ( the extinguishing of life ) , he will pray and [ God ] will give him life [ yes , He will grant life to all those whose sin is not one leading to death ] . There is a sin [ that leads ] to death ; I do not say that one should pray for that .
AMPC	1%20John	5	17	All wrongdoing is sin , and there is sin which does not [ involve ] death [ that may be repented of and forgiven ] .
AMPC	1%20John	5	18	We know [ absolutely ] that anyone born of God does not [ deliberately and knowingly ] practice committing sin , but the One Who was begotten of God carefully watches over and protects him [ Christ ’ s divine presence within him preserves him against the evil ] , and the wicked one does not lay hold ( get a grip ) on him or touch [ him ] .
AMPC	1%20John	5	19	We know [ positively ] that we are of God , and the whole world [ around us ] is under the power of the evil one .
AMPC	1%20John	5	20	And we [ have seen and ] know [ positively ] that the Son of God has [ actually ] come to this world and has given us understanding and insight [ progressively ] to perceive ( recognize ) and come to know better and more clearly Him Who is true ; and we are in Him Who is true—in His Son Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) . This [ Man ] is the true God and Life eternal .
AMPC	1%20John	5	21	Little children , keep yourselves from idols ( false gods ) — [ from anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to God , from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in your life ] . Amen ( so let it be ) . Footnotes -

AMPC	2%20John	1	2	Because of the Truth which lives and stays on in our hearts and will be with us forever :
AMPC	2%20John	1	1	The elderly elder [ of the church addresses this letter ] to the elect ( chosen ) lady ( Cyria ) and her children , whom I truly love—and not only I but also all who are [ progressively ] learning to recognize and know and understand the Truth—
AMPC	2%20John	1	3	Grace ( spiritual blessing ) , mercy , and [ soul ] peace will be with us , from God the Father and from Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , the Father ’ s Son , in all sincerity ( truth ) and love .
AMPC	2%20John	1	4	I was greatly delighted to find some of your children walking ( living ) in [ the ] Truth , just as we have been commanded by the Father [ Himself ] .
AMPC	2%20John	1	5	And now I beg you , lady ( Cyria ) , not as if I were issuing a new charge ( injunction or command ) , but [ simply recalling to your mind ] the one we have had from the beginning , that we love one another .
AMPC	2%20John	1	6	And what this love consists in is this : that we live and walk in accordance with and guided by His commandments ( His orders , ordinances , precepts , teaching ) . This is the commandment , as you have heard from the beginning , that you continue to walk in love [ guided by it and following it ] .
AMPC	2%20John	1	7	For many imposters ( seducers , deceivers , and false leaders ) have gone out into the world , men who will not acknowledge ( confess , admit ) the coming of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) in bodily form . Such a one is the imposter ( the seducer , the deceiver , the false leader , the antagonist of Christ ) and the antichrist .
AMPC	2%20John	1	8	Look to yourselves ( take care ) that you may not lose ( throw away or destroy ) all that we and you have labored for , but that you may [ persevere until you ] win and receive back a perfect reward [ in full ] .
AMPC	2%20John	1	9	Anyone who runs on ahead [ of God ] and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ [ who is not content with what He taught ] does not have God ; but he who continues to live in the doctrine ( teaching ) of Christ [ does have God ] , he has both the Father and the Son .
AMPC	2%20John	1	10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine [ is disloyal to what Jesus Christ taught ] , do not receive him [ do not accept him , do not welcome or admit him ] into [ your ] house or bid him Godspeed or give him any encouragement .
AMPC	2%20John	1	11	For he who wishes him success [ who encourages him , wishing him Godspeed ] is a partaker in his evil doings .
AMPC	2%20John	1	12	I have many things to write to you , but I prefer not to do so with paper and ink ; I hope to come to see you and talk with you face to face , so that our joy may be complete .
AMPC	2%20John	1	13	The children of your elect ( chosen ) sister wish to be remembered to you . Amen ( so be it ) . Copyright ©

AMPC	3%20John	1	3	In fact , I greatly rejoiced when [ some of ] the brethren from time to time arrived and spoke [ so highly ] of the sincerity and fidelity of your life , as indeed you do live in the Truth [ the whole Gospel presents ] .
AMPC	3%20John	1	1	The elderly elder [ of the church addresses this letter ] to the beloved ( esteemed ) Gaius , whom I truly love .
AMPC	3%20John	1	2	Beloved , I pray that you may prosper in every way and [ that your body ] may keep well , even as [ I know ] your soul keeps well and prospers .
AMPC	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than this , to hear that my [ spiritual ] children are living their lives in the Truth .
AMPC	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , it is a fine and faithful work that you are doing when you give any service to the [ Christian ] brethren , and [ especially when they are ] strangers .
AMPC	3%20John	1	6	They have testified before the church of your love and friendship . You will do well to forward them on their journey [ and you will please do so ] in a way worthy of God ’ s [ service ] .
AMPC	3%20John	1	7	For these [ traveling missionaries ] have gone out for the Name ’ s sake ( for His sake ) and are accepting nothing from the Gentiles ( the heathen , the non-Israelites ) .
AMPC	3%20John	1	8	So we ourselves ought to support such people [ to welcome and provide for them ] , in order that we may be fellow workers in the Truth ( the whole Gospel ) and cooperate with its teachers .
AMPC	3%20John	1	9	I have written briefly to the church ; but Diotrephes , who likes to take the lead among them and put himself first , does not acknowledge my authority and refuses to accept my suggestions or to listen to me .
AMPC	3%20John	1	10	So when I arrive , I will call attention to what he is doing , his boiling over and casting malicious reflections upon us with insinuating language . And not satisfied with that , he refuses to receive and welcome the [ missionary ] brethren himself , and also interferes with and forbids those who would welcome them , and tries to expel ( excommunicate ) them from the church .
AMPC	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , do not imitate evil , but imitate good . He who does good is of God ; he who does evil has not seen ( discerned or experienced ) God [ has enjoyed no vision of Him and does not know Him at all ] .
AMPC	3%20John	1	12	Demetrius has warm commendation from everyone—and from the Truth itself ; we add our testimony also , and you know that our testimony is true .
AMPC	3%20John	1	13	I had much [ to say to you when I began ] to write , but I prefer not to put it down with pen ( a reed ) and ink ;
AMPC	3%20John	1	14	I hope to see you soon , and we will talk together face to face .
AMPC	3%20John	1	15	Peace be to you ! ( Good-bye ! ) The friends here send you greetings . Remember me to the friends there [ to every one of them personally ] by name . Copyright ©

AMPC	Jude	1	1	Jude , a servant of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) , and brother of James , [ writes this letter ] to those who are called ( chosen ) , dearly loved by God the Father and separated ( set apart ) and kept for Jesus Christ :
AMPC	Jude	1	2	May mercy , [ soul ] peace , and love be multiplied to you .
AMPC	Jude	1	3	Beloved , my whole concern was to write to you in regard to our common salvation . [ But ] I found it necessary and was impelled to write you and urgently appeal to and exhort [ you ] to contend for the faith which was once for all [ a ] handed down to the saints [ the faith which is that sum of Christian belief which was delivered [ b ] verbally to the holy people of God ] .
AMPC	Jude	1	4	For certain men have crept in stealthily [ [ c ] gaining entrance secretly by a side door ] . Their doom was predicted long ago , ungodly ( impious , profane ) persons who pervert the grace ( the spiritual blessing and favor ) of our God into lawlessness and wantonness and immorality , and disown and deny our sole Master and Lord , Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Jude	1	5	Now I want to remind you , though you were fully informed once for all , that though the Lord [ at one time ] delivered a people out of the land of Egypt , He subsequently destroyed those [ of them ] who did not believe [ who refused to adhere to , trust in , and rely upon Him ] .
AMPC	Jude	1	6	And angels who did not keep ( care for , guard , and hold to ) their own first place of power but abandoned their proper dwelling place—these He has reserved in custody in eternal chains ( bonds ) under the thick gloom of utter darkness until the judgment and doom of the great day .
AMPC	Jude	1	7	[ The wicked are sentenced to suffer ] just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the adjacent towns—which likewise gave themselves over to impurity and indulged in unnatural vice and sensual perversity—are laid out [ in plain sight ] as an exhibit of perpetual punishment [ to warn ] of everlasting fire . ( A )
AMPC	Jude	1	8	Nevertheless in like manner , these dreamers also corrupt the body , scorn and reject authority and government , and revile and libel and scoff at [ heavenly ] glories ( the glorious ones ) .
AMPC	Jude	1	9	But when [ even ] the archangel Michael , contending with the devil , judicially argued ( disputed ) about the body of Moses , he dared not [ presume to ] bring an abusive condemnation against him , but [ simply ] said , The Lord rebuke you ! ( B )
AMPC	Jude	1	10	But these men revile ( scoff and sneer at ) anything they do not happen to be acquainted with and do not understand ; and whatever they do understand physically [ that which they know by mere instinct ] , like irrational beasts—by these they corrupt themselves and are destroyed ( perish ) .
AMPC	Jude	1	11	Woe to them ! For they have run riotously in the way of Cain , and have abandoned themselves for the sake of gain [ it offers them , following ] the error of Balaam , and have perished in rebellion [ like that ] of Korah ! ( C )
AMPC	Jude	1	12	These are hidden reefs ( elements of danger ) in your love feasts , where they boldly feast sumptuously [ carousing together in your midst ] , without scruples providing for themselves [ alone ] . They are clouds without water , swept along by the winds ; trees , without fruit at the late autumn gathering time—twice ( doubly ) dead , [ lifeless and ] plucked up by the roots ;
AMPC	Jude	1	13	Wild waves of the sea , flinging up the foam of their own shame and disgrace ; wandering stars , for whom the gloom of eternal darkness has been reserved forever .
AMPC	Jude	1	14	It was of these people , moreover , that Enoch in the seventh [ generation ] from Adam prophesied when he said , Behold , the Lord comes with His myriads of holy ones ( ten thousands of His saints )
AMPC	Jude	1	15	To execute judgment upon all and to convict all the impious ( unholy ones ) of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed [ in such an ] ungodly [ way ] , and of all the severe ( abusive , jarring ) things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him .
AMPC	Jude	1	16	These are inveterate murmurers ( grumblers ) who complain [ of their lot in life ] , going after their own desires [ controlled by their passions ] ; their talk is boastful and arrogant , [ and they claim to ] admire men ’ s persons and pay people flattering compliments to gain advantage .
AMPC	Jude	1	17	But you must remember , beloved , the predictions which were made by the apostles ( the special messengers ) of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed One ) .
AMPC	Jude	1	18	They told you beforehand , In the last days ( in the end time ) there will be scoffers [ who seek to gratify their own unholy desires ] , following after their own ungodly passions .
AMPC	Jude	1	19	It is these who are [ agitators ] setting up distinctions and causing divisions—merely sensual [ creatures , carnal , worldly-minded people ] , devoid of the [ Holy ] Spirit and destitute of any higher spiritual life .
AMPC	Jude	1	20	But you , beloved , build yourselves up [ founded ] on your most holy faith [ [ d ] make progress , rise like an edifice higher and higher ] , praying in the Holy Spirit ;
AMPC	Jude	1	21	Guard and keep yourselves in the love of God ; expect and patiently wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ ( the Messiah ) — [ which will bring you ] unto life eternal .
AMPC	Jude	1	22	And refute [ so as to ] convict some who dispute with you , and on some have mercy who waver and doubt .
AMPC	Jude	1	23	[ Strive to ] save others , snatching [ them ] out of [ the ] fire ; on others take pity [ but ] with fear , loathing even the garment spotted by the flesh and polluted by their sensuality . ( D )
AMPC	Jude	1	24	Now to Him Who is able to keep you without stumbling or slipping or falling , and to present [ you ] unblemished ( blameless and faultless ) before the presence of His glory in triumphant joy and exultation [ with unspeakable , ecstatic delight ] —
AMPC	Jude	1	25	To the one only God , our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory ( splendor ) , majesty , might and dominion , and power and authority , before all time and now and forever ( unto all the ages of eternity ) . Amen ( so be it ) . Copyright ©

AMPC	Revelation	1	1	[ This is ] the revelation of Jesus Christ [ His unveiling of the divine mysteries ] . God gave it to Him to disclose and make known to His bond servants certain things which must shortly and speedily come to pass [ a ] in their entirety . And He sent and communicated it through His angel ( messenger ) to His bond servant John ,
AMPC	Revelation	1	2	Who has testified to and vouched for all that he saw [ [ b ] in his visions ] , the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ .
AMPC	Revelation	1	3	Blessed ( happy , [ c ] to be envied ) is the man who reads aloud [ in the assemblies ] the word of this prophecy ; and blessed ( happy , [ d ] to be envied ) are those who hear [ it read ] and who keep themselves true to the things which are written in it [ heeding them and laying them to heart ] , for the time [ for them to be fulfilled ] is near .
AMPC	Revelation	1	4	John to the seven assemblies ( churches ) that are in Asia : May grace ( God ’ s unmerited favor ) be granted to you and spiritual peace ( [ e ] the peace of Christ ’ s kingdom ) from Him Who is and Who was and Who is to come , and from the seven Spirits [ [ f ] the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] before His throne , ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	1	5	And from Jesus Christ the faithful and trustworthy Witness , the Firstborn of the dead [ first to be brought back to life ] and the Prince ( Ruler ) of the kings of the earth . To Him Who [ g ] ever loves us and has [ h ] once [ for all ] loosed and freed us from our sins by His own blood , ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	1	6	And formed us into a kingdom ( a royal race ) , priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the power and the majesty and the dominion throughout the ages and forever and ever . Amen ( so be it ) . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	1	7	Behold , He is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see Him , even those who pierced Him ; and all the tribes of the earth shall gaze upon Him and beat their breasts and mourn and lament over Him . Even so [ must it be ] . Amen ( so be it ) . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	1	8	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End , says the Lord God , He Who is and Who was and Who is to come , the Almighty ( the Ruler of all ) . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	1	9	I , John , your brother and companion ( sharer and participator ) with you in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance [ which are ] in Jesus Christ , was on the isle called Patmos , [ banished ] on account of [ my witnessing to ] the Word of God and the testimony ( the proof , the evidence ) for Jesus Christ .
AMPC	Revelation	1	10	I was in the Spirit [ rapt in His power ] on the Lord ’ s Day , and I heard behind me a great voice like the calling of a [ i ] war trumpet ,
AMPC	Revelation	1	11	Saying , I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last . Write promptly what you see ( your vision ) in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia—to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea .
AMPC	Revelation	1	12	Then I turned to see [ whose was ] the voice that was speaking to me , and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands ,
AMPC	Revelation	1	13	And in the midst of the lampstands [ One ] like a Son of Man , clothed with a robe which reached to His feet and with a girdle of gold about His breast . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	1	14	His head and His hair were white like white wool , [ as white ] as snow , and His eyes [ flashed ] like a flame of fire . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	1	15	His feet glowed like burnished ( bright ) bronze as it is refined in a furnace , and His voice was like the sound of many waters . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	1	16	In His right hand He held seven stars , and from His mouth there came forth a sharp two-edged sword , and His face was like the sun shining in full power at midday . ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	1	17	When I saw Him , I fell at His feet as if dead . But He laid His right hand on me and said , Do not be afraid ! I am the First and the Last , ( J )
AMPC	Revelation	1	18	And the Ever-living One [ I am living in the eternity of the eternities ] . I died , but see , I am alive forevermore ; and I possess the keys of death and Hades ( the realm of the dead ) .
AMPC	Revelation	1	19	Write therefore the things you see , what they are [ and signify ] and what is to take place hereafter .
AMPC	Revelation	1	20	As to the hidden meaning ( the mystery ) of the seven stars which you saw on My right hand and the seven lampstands of gold : the seven stars are the seven angels ( messengers ) of the seven assemblies ( churches ) and the seven lampstands are the seven churches .

AMPC	Revelation	2	2	I know your industry and activities , laborious toil and trouble , and your patient endurance , and how you can not tolerate wicked [ men ] and have tested and critically appraised those who call [ themselves ] apostles ( special messengers of Christ ) and yet are not , and have found them to be impostors and liars .
AMPC	Revelation	2	3	I know you are enduring patiently and are bearing up for My name ’ s sake , and you have not fainted or become exhausted or grown weary .
AMPC	Revelation	2	4	But I have this [ one charge to make ] against you : that you have left ( abandoned ) the love that you had at first [ you have deserted Me , your first love ] .
AMPC	Revelation	2	5	Remember then from what heights you have fallen . Repent ( change the inner man to meet God ’ s will ) and do the works you did previously [ when first you knew the Lord ] , or else I will visit you and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you change your mind and repent .
AMPC	Revelation	2	6	Yet you have this [ in your favor and to your credit ] : you hate the works of the Nicolaitans [ what they are doing as corrupters of the people ] , which I Myself also detest .
AMPC	Revelation	2	7	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) . To him who overcomes ( is victorious ) , I will grant to eat [ of the fruit ] of the tree of life , which is in the paradise of God . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	2	8	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Smyrna write : These are the words of the First and the Last , Who died and came to life again : ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	2	9	I know your affliction and distress and pressing trouble and your poverty—but you are rich ! and how you are abused and reviled and slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
AMPC	Revelation	2	10	Fear nothing that you are about to suffer . [ Dismiss your dread and your fears ! ] Behold , the devil is indeed about to throw some of you into prison , that you may be tested and proved and critically appraised , and for ten days you will have affliction . Be loyally faithful unto death [ even if you must die for it ] , and I will give you the crown of life . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	2	11	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) . He who overcomes ( is victorious ) shall in no way be injured by the second death .
AMPC	Revelation	2	12	Then to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Pergamum write : These are the words of Him Who has and wields the sharp two-edged sword :
AMPC	Revelation	2	13	I know where you live—a place where Satan sits enthroned . [ Yet ] you are clinging to and holding fast My name , and you did not deny My faith , even in the days of Antipas , My witness , My faithful one , who was killed ( martyred ) in your midst—where Satan dwells .
AMPC	Revelation	2	14	Nevertheless , I have a few things against you : you have some people there who are clinging to the teaching of Balaam , who taught Balak to set a trap and a stumbling block before the sons of Israel , [ to entice them ] to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and to practice lewdness [ giving themselves up to sexual vice ] . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	2	15	You also have some who in a similar way are clinging to the teaching of the Nicolaitans [ those corrupters of the people ] which thing I hate .
AMPC	Revelation	2	16	Repent [ then ] ! Or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth .
AMPC	Revelation	2	17	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) . To him who overcomes ( conquers ) , I will give to eat of the manna that is hidden , and I will give him a white stone with a new name engraved on the stone , which no one knows or understands except he who receives it . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	2	18	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Thyatira write : These are the words of the Son of God , Who has eyes that flash like a flame of fire , and Whose feet glow like bright and burnished and white-hot bronze : ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	2	19	I know your record and what you are doing , your love and faith and service and patient endurance , and that your recent works are more numerous and greater than your first ones .
AMPC	Revelation	2	20	But I have this against you : that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess [ claiming to be inspired ] , and who is teaching and leading astray my servants and beguiling them into practicing sexual vice and eating food sacrificed to idols . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	2	21	I gave her time to repent , but she has no desire to repent of her immorality [ symbolic of idolatry ] and refuses to do so .
AMPC	Revelation	2	22	Take note : I will throw her on a bed [ [ a ] of anguish ] , and those who commit adultery with her [ her paramours ] I will bring down to [ b ] pressing distress and severe affliction , unless they turn away their minds from conduct [ such as ] hers and repent of [ c ] their doings .
AMPC	Revelation	2	23	And I will strike her children ( her proper followers ) dead [ thoroughly exterminating them ] . And all the assemblies ( churches ) shall recognize and understand that I am He Who searches minds ( the thoughts , feelings , and purposes ) and the [ inmost ] hearts , and I will give to each of you [ the reward for what you have done ] as your work deserves . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	2	24	But to the rest of you in Thyatira , who do not hold this teaching , who have not explored and known the depths of Satan , as they say—I tell you that I do not lay upon you any other [ fresh ] burden :
AMPC	Revelation	2	25	Only hold fast to what you have until I come .
AMPC	Revelation	2	26	And he who overcomes ( is victorious ) and who obeys My commands to the [ very ] end [ doing the works that please Me ] , I will give him authority and power over the nations ;
AMPC	Revelation	2	27	And he shall rule them with a sceptre ( rod ) of iron , as when earthen pots are broken in pieces , and [ his power over them shall be ] like that which I Myself have received from My Father ; ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	2	28	And I will give him the Morning Star .
AMPC	Revelation	2	29	He who is able to hear , let him listen to and heed what the [ Holy ] Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) .

AMPC	Revelation	3	3	So call to mind the lessons you received and heard ; continually lay them to heart and obey them , and repent . In case you will not rouse yourselves and keep awake and watch , I will come upon you like a thief , and you will not know or suspect at what hour I will come .
AMPC	Revelation	3	2	Rouse yourselves and keep awake , and strengthen and invigorate what remains and is on the point of dying ; for I have not found a thing that you have done [ any work of yours ] meeting the requirements of My God or perfect in His sight .
AMPC	Revelation	3	4	Yet you still have a few [ persons ’ ] names in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes , and they shall walk with Me in white , because they are worthy and deserving .
AMPC	Revelation	3	5	Thus shall he who conquers ( is victorious ) be clad in white garments , and I will not erase or blot out his name from the Book of Life ; I will acknowledge him [ as Mine ] and I will confess his name openly before My Father and before His angels . ( A )

AMPC	Revelation	3	8	I know your [ record of ] works and what you are doing . See ! I have set before you a door wide open which no one is able to shut ; I know that you have but little power , and yet you have kept My Word and guarded My message and have not renounced or denied My name .
AMPC	Revelation	3	9	Take note ! I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews and are not , but lie—behold , I will make them come and bow down before your feet and learn and acknowledge that I have loved you . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	3	10	Because you have guarded and kept My word of patient endurance [ have held fast the [ b ] lesson of My patience with the [ c ] expectant endurance that I give you ] , I also will keep you [ safe ] from the hour of trial ( testing ) which is coming on the whole world to try those who dwell upon the earth .

AMPC	Revelation	3	12	He who overcomes ( is victorious ) , I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God ; he shall never be put out of it or go out of it , and I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God , the new Jerusalem , which descends from My God out of heaven , and My own new name . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	3	13	He who can hear , let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies ( churches ) .
AMPC	Revelation	3	14	And to the angel ( messenger ) of the assembly ( church ) in Laodicea write : These are the words of the Amen , the trusty and faithful and true Witness , the Origin and Beginning and Author of God ’ s creation : ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	3	15	I know your [ record of ] works and what you are doing ; you are neither cold nor hot . Would that you were cold or hot !
AMPC	Revelation	3	16	So , because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot , I will spew you out of My mouth !
AMPC	Revelation	3	17	For you say , I am rich ; I have prospered and grown wealthy , and I am in need of nothing ; and you do not realize and understand that you are wretched , pitiable , poor , blind , and naked . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	3	18	Therefore I counsel you to purchase from Me gold refined and tested by fire , that you may be [ truly ] wealthy , and white clothes to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nudity from being seen , and salve to put on your eyes , that you may see .
AMPC	Revelation	3	19	Those whom I [ dearly and tenderly ] love , I tell their faults and convict and convince and reprove and chasten [ I discipline and instruct them ] . So be enthusiastic and in earnest and burning with zeal and repent [ changing your mind and attitude ] . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	3	20	Behold , I stand at the door and knock ; if anyone hears and listens to and heeds My voice and opens the door , I will come in to him and will eat with him , and he [ will eat ] with Me .

AMPC	Revelation	4	4	Twenty-four other thrones surrounded the throne , and seated on these thrones were twenty-four elders ( [ b ] the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin ) , arrayed in white clothing , with crowns of gold upon their heads .
AMPC	Revelation	4	2	At once I came under the [ Holy ] Spirit ’ s power , and behold , a throne stood in heaven , with One seated on the throne ! ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	4	3	And He Who sat there appeared like [ the crystalline brightness of ] jasper and [ the fiery ] sardius , and encircling the throne there was a halo that looked like [ a rainbow of ] emerald . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	4	5	Out from the throne came flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder , and in front of the throne seven blazing torches burned , which are the seven Spirits of God [ [ c ] the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] ;
AMPC	Revelation	4	6	And in front of the throne there was also what looked like a transparent glassy sea , as if of crystal . And around the throne , in the center at each side of the throne , were four living creatures ( beings ) who were full of eyes in front and behind [ with intelligence as to what is before and at the rear of them ] . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	4	7	The first living creature ( being ) was like a lion , the second living creature like an ox , the third living creature had the face of a man , and the fourth living creature [ was ] like a flying eagle . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	4	8	And the four living creatures , individually having six wings , were full of eyes all over and within [ underneath their wings ] ; and day and night they never stop saying , Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God Almighty ( Omnipotent ) , Who was and Who is and Who is to come . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	4	9	And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him Who sits on the throne , Who lives forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) , ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	4	10	The twenty-four elders ( [ d ] the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin ) fall prostrate before Him Who is sitting on the throne , and they worship Him Who lives forever and ever ; and they throw down their crowns before the throne , crying out ,
AMPC	Revelation	4	11	Worthy are You , our Lord and God , to receive the glory and the honor and dominion , for You created all things ; by Your will they were [ brought into being ] and were created .

AMPC	Revelation	5	5	Then one of the elders [ [ b ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] said to me , Stop weeping ! See , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root ( Source ) of David , has won ( has overcome and conquered ) ! He can open the scroll and break its seven seals ! ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a strong angel announcing in a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the scroll ? And [ who is entitled and deserves and is morally fit ] to break its seals ?
AMPC	Revelation	5	3	And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth [ in the realm of the dead , Hades ] was able to open the scroll or to take a [ single ] look at its contents .
AMPC	Revelation	5	4	And I wept audibly and bitterly because no one was found fit to open the scroll or to inspect it .
AMPC	Revelation	5	6	And there between the throne and the four living creatures ( beings ) and among the elders [ [ c ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] I saw a Lamb standing , as though it had been slain , with seven horns and with seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God [ [ d ] the sevenfold Holy Spirit ] Who have been sent [ on duty far and wide ] into all the earth . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	5	7	He then went and took the scroll from the right hand of Him Who sat on the throne .
AMPC	Revelation	5	8	And when He had taken the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders [ [ e ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] prostrated themselves before the Lamb . Each was holding a harp ( lute or guitar ) , and they had golden bowls full of incense ( fragrant spices and gums for burning ) , which are the prayers of God ’ s people ( the saints ) .
AMPC	Revelation	5	9	And [ now ] they sing a new song , saying , You are worthy to take the scroll and to break the seals that are on it , for You were slain ( sacrificed ) , and with Your blood You purchased men unto God from every tribe and language and people and nation . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	5	10	And You have made them a kingdom ( royal race ) and priests to our God , and they shall reign [ as kings ] over the earth ! ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked , and I heard the voices of many angels on every side of the throne and of the living creatures and the elders [ [ f ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] , and they numbered ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands , ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	5	12	Saying in a loud voice , Deserving is the Lamb , Who was sacrificed , to receive all the power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and majesty ( glory , splendor ) and blessing !
AMPC	Revelation	5	13	And I heard every created thing in heaven and on earth and under the earth [ in Hades , the place of departed spirits ] and on the sea and all that is in it , crying out together , To Him Who is seated on the throne and to the Lamb be ascribed the blessing and the honor and the majesty ( glory , splendor ) and the power ( might and dominion ) forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) ! ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	5	14	Then the four living creatures ( beings ) said , Amen ( so be it ) ! And the elders [ [ g ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] prostrated themselves and worshiped Him Who lives forever and ever .

AMPC	Revelation	6	6	And I heard what seemed to be a voice from the midst of the four living creatures , saying , A quart of wheat for a denarius [ a whole day ’ s wages ] , and three quarts of barley for a denarius ; but do not harm the oil and the wine ! ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	6	2	And I looked , and saw there a white horse whose rider carried a bow . And a crown was given him , and he rode forth conquering and to conquer . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	6	3	And when He broke the second seal , I heard the second living creature call out , Come !
AMPC	Revelation	6	4	And another horse came out , flaming red . And its rider was empowered to take the peace from the earth , so that men slaughtered one another ; and he was given a huge sword .
AMPC	Revelation	6	5	When He broke open the third seal , I heard the third living creature call out , Come and look ! And I saw , and behold , a black horse , and in his hand the rider had a pair of scales ( a balance ) .
AMPC	Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb broke open the fourth seal , I heard the fourth living creature call out , Come !
AMPC	Revelation	6	8	So I looked , and behold , an ashy pale horse [ [ a ] black and blue as if made so by bruising ] , and its rider ’ s name was Death , and Hades ( the realm of the dead ) followed him closely . And they were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague ( pestilence , disease ) and with wild beasts of the earth . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal , I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for [ adhering to ] the Word of God and for the testimony they had borne .
AMPC	Revelation	6	10	They cried in a loud voice , O [ Sovereign ] Lord , holy and true , how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth ? ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	6	11	Then they were each given a [ b ] long and flowing and festive white robe and told to rest and wait patiently a little while longer , until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been .
AMPC	Revelation	6	12	When He [ the Lamb ] broke open the sixth seal , I looked , and there was a great earthquake ; and the sun grew black as sackcloth of hair , [ the full disc of ] the moon became like blood . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	6	13	And the stars of the sky dropped to the earth like a fig tree shedding its unripe fruit out of season when shaken by a strong wind . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	6	14	And the [ c ] sky rolled up like a scroll and vanished , and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place .
AMPC	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth and their noblemen and their magnates and their military chiefs and the wealthy and the strong and [ everyone , whether ] slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains , ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	6	16	And they called to the mountains and the rocks , Fall on ( before ) us and hide us from the face of Him Who sits on the throne and from the [ d ] deep-seated indignation and wrath of the Lamb . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	6	17	For the great day of His wrath ( vengeance , retribution , indignation ) has come , and who is able to stand before it ?

AMPC	Revelation	7	7	Twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon , 12,000 of the tribe of Levi , 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar ,
AMPC	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw a second angel coming up from the east ( the rising of the sun ) and carrying the seal of the living God . And with a loud voice he called out to the four angels who had been given authority and power to injure earth and sea ,
AMPC	Revelation	7	3	Saying , Harm neither the earth nor the sea nor the trees , until we have sealed the bond servants of our God upon their foreheads . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	7	4	And [ then ] I heard how many were sealed ( marked ) out of every tribe of the sons of Israel : there were 144,000 .
AMPC	Revelation	7	5	Twelve thousand were sealed ( marked ) out of the tribe of Judah , 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben , 12,000 of the tribe of Gad ,
AMPC	Revelation	7	6	Twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher , 12,000 of the tribe of Naphtali , 12,000 of the tribe of Manasseh ,
AMPC	Revelation	7	8	Twelve thousand of the tribe of Zebulun , 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph , 12,000 of the tribe of Benjamin .
AMPC	Revelation	7	9	After this I looked and a vast host appeared which no one could count , [ gathered out ] of every nation , from all tribes and peoples and languages . These stood before the throne and before the Lamb ; they were attired in white robes , with palm branches in their hands .
AMPC	Revelation	7	10	In loud voice they cried , saying , [ Our ] salvation is due to our God , Who is seated on the throne , and to the Lamb [ to Them we owe our deliverance ] !
AMPC	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders [ [ b ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] and the four living creatures , and they fell prostrate before the throne and worshiped God .
AMPC	Revelation	7	12	Amen ! ( So be it ! ) they cried . Blessing and glory and majesty and splendor and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and might [ be ascribed ] to our God to the ages and ages ( forever and ever , throughout the eternities of the eternities ) ! Amen ! ( So be it ! )
AMPC	Revelation	7	13	Then , addressing me , one of the elders [ [ c ] of the heavenly Sanhedrin ] said , Who are these [ people ] clothed in the long white robes ? And from where have they come ?
AMPC	Revelation	7	14	I replied , Sir , you know . And he said to me , These are they who have come out of the great tribulation ( persecution ) , and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	7	15	For this reason they are [ now ] before the [ very ] throne of God and serve Him day and night in His sanctuary ( temple ) ; and He Who is sitting upon the throne will protect and spread His tabernacle over and shelter them with His presence .
AMPC	Revelation	7	16	They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun smite them , nor any [ d ] scorching heat . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	7	17	For the Lamb Who is in the midst of the throne will be their Shepherd , and He will guide them to the springs of the waters of life ; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes .

AMPC	Revelation	8	8	The second angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and something resembling a great mountain , blazing with fire , was hurled into the sea . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	8	2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God , and to them were given seven trumpets .
AMPC	Revelation	8	3	And another angel came and stood over the altar . He had a golden censer , and he was given very much incense ( fragrant spices and gums which exhale perfume when burned ) , that he might mingle it with the prayers of all the people of God ( the saints ) upon the golden altar before the throne . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	8	4	And the smoke of the incense ( the perfume ) arose in the presence of God , with the prayers of the people of God ( the saints ) , from the hand of the angel .
AMPC	Revelation	8	5	So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and cast it upon the earth . Then there followed peals of thunder and loud rumblings and blasts and noises , and flashes of lightning and an earthquake . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them .
AMPC	Revelation	8	7	The first angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and there was a storm of hail and fire mingled with blood cast upon the earth . And a third part of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees was burned up and all the green grass was burned up . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	8	9	And a third of the sea was turned to blood , a third of the living creatures in the sea perished , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
AMPC	Revelation	8	10	The third angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and a huge star fell from heaven , burning like a torch , and it dropped on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water—
AMPC	Revelation	8	11	And the name of the star is Wormwood . A third part of the waters was changed into wormwood , and many people died from using the water , because it had become bitter .
AMPC	Revelation	8	12	Then the fourth angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and a third of the sun was smitten , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars , so that [ the light of ] a third of them was darkened , and a third of the daylight [ itself ] was withdrawn , and likewise a third [ of the light ] of the night was kept from shining .
AMPC	Revelation	8	13	Then I [ looked and I ] saw a solitary eagle flying in midheaven , and as it flew I heard it crying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe to those who dwell on the earth , because of the rest of the trumpet blasts which the three angels are about to sound ! Copyright ©

AMPC	Revelation	9	9	Their breastplates ( scales ) resembled breastplates made of iron , and the [ whirring ] noise made by their wings was like the roar of a vast number of horse-drawn chariots going at full speed into battle . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	9	2	He opened the [ b ] long shaft of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) , and smoke like the smoke of a huge furnace puffed out of the [ c ] long shaft , so that the sun and the atmosphere were darkened by the smoke from the long shaft . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	9	3	Then out of the smoke locusts came forth on the earth , and such power was granted them as the power the earth ’ s scorpions have . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to injure the herbage of the earth nor any green thing nor any tree , but only [ to attack ] such human beings as do not have the seal ( mark ) of God on their foreheads . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	9	5	They were not permitted to kill them , but to torment ( distress , vex ) them for five months ; and the pain caused them was like the torture of a scorpion when it stings a person .
AMPC	Revelation	9	6	And in those days people will seek death and will not find it ; and they will yearn to die , but death evades and flees from them . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	9	7	The locusts resembled horses equipped for battle . On their heads was something like golden crowns . Their faces resembled the faces of people . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	9	8	They had hair like the hair of women , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	9	10	They have tails like scorpions , and they have stings , and in their tails lies their ability to hurt men for [ the ] five months .
AMPC	Revelation	9	11	Over them as king they have the angel of the Abyss ( of the bottomless pit ) . In Hebrew his name is Abaddon [ destruction ] , but in Greek he is called Apollyon [ destroyer ] .
AMPC	Revelation	9	12	The first woe ( calamity ) has passed ; behold , two others are yet to follow .
AMPC	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel blew [ his ] trumpet , and from the four horns of the golden altar which stands before God I heard a solitary voice ,
AMPC	Revelation	9	14	Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , Liberate the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates .
AMPC	Revelation	9	15	So the four angels who had been in readiness for that hour in the appointed day , month , and year were liberated to destroy a third of mankind .
AMPC	Revelation	9	16	The number of their troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand ( 200,000,000 ) ; I heard what their number was .
AMPC	Revelation	9	17	And in [ my ] vision the horses and their riders appeared to me like this : the riders wore breastplates the color of fiery red and sapphire blue and sulphur ( brimstone ) yellow . The heads of the horses looked like lions ’ heads , and from their mouths there poured fire and smoke and sulphur ( brimstone ) .
AMPC	Revelation	9	18	A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues—by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur ( brimstone ) that poured from the mouths of the horses .
AMPC	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses to do harm is in their mouths and also in their tails . Their tails are like serpents , for they have heads , and it is by means of them that they wound people .
AMPC	Revelation	9	20	And the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues even then did not repent of [ the worship of ] the works of their [ own ] hands , so as to cease paying homage to the demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor move . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	9	21	And they did not repent of their murders or their practice of magic ( sorceries ) or their sexual vice or their thefts .

AMPC	Revelation	10	10	So I took the little book from the angel ’ s hand and ate and swallowed it ; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth , but once I had swallowed it , my stomach was embittered .
AMPC	Revelation	10	2	He had a little book ( scroll ) open in his hand . He set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land ,
AMPC	Revelation	10	3	And he shouted with a loud voice like the roaring of a lion ; and when he had shouted , the seven thunders gave voice and uttered their message in distinct words .
AMPC	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders had spoken ( sounded ) , I was going to write [ it down ] , but I heard a voice from heaven saying , Seal up what the seven thunders have said ! Do not write it down !
AMPC	Revelation	10	5	Then the [ mighty ] angel whom I had seen stationed on sea and land raised his right hand to heaven ( the [ a ] sky ) , ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	10	6	And swore in the name of ( by ) Him Who lives forever and ever , Who created the heavens ( [ b ] sky ) and all they contain , and the earth and all that it contains , and the sea and all that it contains . [ He swore ] that no more time should intervene and there should be no more waiting or delay ,
AMPC	Revelation	10	7	But that when the days come when the trumpet call of the seventh angel is about to be sounded , then God ’ s mystery ( His secret design , His hidden purpose ) , as He had announced the glad tidings to His servants the prophets , should be fulfilled ( accomplished , completed ) . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	10	8	Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke again to me , saying , Go and take the little book ( scroll ) which is open on the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land .
AMPC	Revelation	10	9	So I went up to the angel and asked him to give me the little book . And he said to me , Take it and eat it . It will embitter your stomach , though in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	10	11	Then they said to me , You are to make a fresh prophecy concerning many peoples and races and nations and languages and kings . ( D ) Footnotes - Revelation 10:5 G. Abbott-Smith , Manual Greek Lexicon . - Revelation 10:6 G. Abbott-Smith , Manual Greek Lexicon . Copyright ©

AMPC	Revelation	11	11	But after three and a half days , by God ’ s gift the breath of life again entered into them , and they rose up on their feet , and great dread and terror fell on those who watched them . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	11	2	But leave out of your measuring the court outside the sanctuary of God ; omit that , for it is given over to the Gentiles ( the nations ) , and they will trample the holy city underfoot for
AMPC	Revelation	11	42	months ; three and one-half years ) , dressed in sackcloth .
AMPC	Revelation	11	3	And I will grant the power of prophecy to My two witnesses for 1,260 (
AMPC	Revelation	11	4	These [ witnesses ] are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	11	5	And if anyone attempts to injure them , fire pours from their mouth and consumes their enemies ; if anyone should attempt to harm them , thus he is doomed to be slain . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	11	6	These [ two witnesses ] have power to shut up the sky , so that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying ( their [ a ] prediction of events relating to Christ ’ s kingdom and its speedy triumph ) ; and they also have power to turn the waters into blood and to smite and scourge the earth with all manner of plagues as often as they choose . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	11	7	But when they have finished their testimony and their evidence is all in , the beast ( monster ) that comes up out of the Abyss ( bottomless pit ) will wage war on them , and conquer them and kill them . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	11	8	And their dead bodies [ will lie exposed ] in the open street ( [ b ] a public square ) of the great city which is in a spiritual sense called [ by the mystical and allegorical names of ] Sodom and Egypt , where also their Lord was crucified . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	11	9	For three and a half days men from the races and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be put in a tomb .
AMPC	Revelation	11	10	And those who dwell on the earth will gloat and exult over them and rejoice exceedingly , taking their ease and sending presents [ in congratulation ] to one another , because these two prophets had been such a vexation and trouble and torment to all the dwellers on the earth .
AMPC	Revelation	11	12	Then [ the two witnesses ] heard a strong voice from heaven calling to them , Come up here ! And before the very eyes of their enemies they ascended into heaven in a cloud . ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	11	13	And at that [ very ] hour there was a tremendous earthquake and one tenth of the city was destroyed ( fell ) ; seven thousand people perished in the earthquake , and those who remained were filled with dread and terror and were awe-struck , and they glorified the God of heaven .
AMPC	Revelation	11	14	The second woe ( calamity ) has passed ; now the third woe is speedily to come .
AMPC	Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel then blew [ his ] trumpet , and there were mighty voices in heaven , shouting , The dominion ( kingdom , sovereignty , rule ) of the world has now come into the possession and become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ ( the Messiah ) , and He shall reign forever and ever ( for the eternities of the eternities ) ! ( J )
AMPC	Revelation	11	16	Then the twenty-four elders [ of [ c ] the heavenly Sanhedrin ] , who sit on their thrones before God , prostrated themselves before Him and worshiped ,
AMPC	Revelation	11	17	Exclaiming , To You we give thanks , Lord God Omnipotent , [ the One ] Who is and [ ever ] was , for assuming the high sovereignty and the great power that are Yours and for beginning to reign .
AMPC	Revelation	11	18	And the heathen ( the nations ) raged , but Your wrath ( retribution , indignation ) came , the time when the dead will be judged and Your servants the prophets and saints rewarded—and those who revere ( fear ) Your name , both low and high and small and great—and [ the time ] for destroying the corrupters of the earth . ( K )
AMPC	Revelation	11	19	Then the sanctuary of God in heaven was thrown open , and the ark of His covenant was seen standing inside in His sanctuary ; and there were flashes of lightning , loud rumblings ( blasts , mutterings ) , peals of thunder , an earthquake , and a terrific hailstorm .

AMPC	Revelation	12	12	Therefore be glad ( exult ) , O heavens and you that dwell in them ! But woe to you , O earth and sea , for the devil has come down to you in fierce anger ( fury ) , because he knows that he has [ only ] a short time [ left ] ! ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and she cried out in her birth pangs , in the anguish of her delivery .
AMPC	Revelation	12	3	Then another ominous sign ( wonder ) was seen in heaven : Behold , a huge , fiery-red dragon , with seven heads and ten horns , and seven kingly crowns ( diadems ) upon his heads . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	12	4	His tail swept [ across the sky ] and dragged down a third of the stars and flung them to the earth . And the dragon stationed himself in front of the woman who was about to be delivered , so that he might devour her child as soon as she brought it forth . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	12	5	And she brought forth a male Child , One Who is destined to shepherd ( rule ) all the nations with an iron staff ( scepter ) , and her Child was caught up to God and to His throne . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	12	6	And the woman [ herself ] fled into the desert ( wilderness ) , where she has a retreat prepared [ for her ] by God , in which she is to be fed and kept safe for 1,260 days (
AMPC	Revelation	12	42	months ; three and one-half years ) .
AMPC	Revelation	12	7	Then war broke out in heaven ; Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon , and the dragon and his angels fought .
AMPC	Revelation	12	8	But they were defeated , and there was no room found for them in heaven any longer .
AMPC	Revelation	12	9	And the huge dragon was cast down and out—that age-old serpent , who is called the Devil and Satan , he who is the seducer ( deceiver ) of all humanity the world over ; he was forced out and down to the earth , and his angels were flung out along with him . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a strong ( loud ) voice in heaven , saying , Now it has come—the salvation and the power and the kingdom ( the dominion , the reign ) of our God , and the power ( the sovereignty , the authority ) of His Christ ( the Messiah ) ; for the accuser of our brethren , he who keeps bringing before our God charges against them day and night , has been cast out ! ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	12	11	And they have overcome ( conquered ) him by means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony , for they did not love and cling to life even when faced with death [ holding their lives cheap till they had to die for their witnessing ] .
AMPC	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth , he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male Child .
AMPC	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was supplied with the two wings of a giant eagle , so that she might fly from the presence of the serpent into the desert ( wilderness ) , to the retreat where she is to be kept safe and fed for a time , and times , and half a time ( three and one-half years , or 1,260 days ) . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	12	15	Then out of his mouth the serpent spouted forth water like a flood after the woman , that she might be carried off with the torrent .
AMPC	Revelation	12	16	But the earth came to the rescue of the woman , and the ground opened its mouth and swallowed up the stream of water which the dragon had spouted from his mouth .
AMPC	Revelation	12	17	So then the dragon was furious ( enraged ) at the woman , and he went away to wage war on the remainder of her descendants— [ on those ] who obey God ’ s commandments and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ [ and adhere to it and [ a ] bear witness to Him ] .

AMPC	Revelation	13	13	He performs great signs ( startling miracles ) , even making fire fall from the sky to the earth in men ’ s sight .
AMPC	Revelation	13	2	And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard , but his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth was like that of a lion . And to him the dragon gave his [ own ] might and power and his [ own ] throne and great dominion .
AMPC	Revelation	13	3	And one of his heads seemed to have a deadly wound . But his death stroke was healed ; and the whole earth went after the beast in amazement and admiration .
AMPC	Revelation	13	4	They fell down and paid homage to the dragon , because he had bestowed on the beast all his dominion and authority ; they also praised and worshiped the beast , exclaiming , Who is a match for the beast , and , Who can make war against him ?
AMPC	Revelation	13	5	And the beast was given the power of speech , uttering boastful and blasphemous words , and he was given freedom to exert his authority and to exercise his will during forty-two months ( three and a half years ) . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	13	6	And he opened his mouth to speak slanders against God , blaspheming His name and His abode , [ even vilifying ] those who live in heaven .
AMPC	Revelation	13	7	He was further permitted to wage war on God ’ s holy people ( the saints ) and to overcome them . And power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation , ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	13	8	And all the inhabitants of the earth will fall down in adoration and pay him homage , everyone whose name has not been recorded in the Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain [ in sacrifice ] [ b ] from the foundation of the world .
AMPC	Revelation	13	9	If anyone is able to hear , let him listen :
AMPC	Revelation	13	10	Whoever leads into captivity will himself go into captivity ; if anyone slays with the sword , with the sword must he be slain . Herein is [ the call for ] the patience and the faith and fidelity of the saints ( God ’ s people ) . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	13	11	Then I saw another beast rising up out of the land [ itself ] ; he had two horns like a lamb , and he spoke ( roared ) like a dragon .
AMPC	Revelation	13	12	He exerts all the power and right of control of the former beast in his presence , and causes the earth and those who dwell upon it to exalt and deify the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed , and to worship him .
AMPC	Revelation	13	14	And because of the signs ( miracles ) which he is allowed to perform in the presence of the [ first ] beast , he deceives those who inhabit the earth , commanding them to erect a statue ( an image ) in the likeness of the beast who was wounded by the [ small ] sword and still lived . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	13	15	And he is permitted [ also ] to impart the breath of life into the beast ’ s image , so that the statue of the beast could actually talk and cause to be put to death those who would not bow down and worship the image of the beast . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	13	16	Also he compels all [ alike ] , both small and great , both the rich and the poor , both free and slave , to be marked with an inscription [ [ c ] stamped ] on their right hands or on their foreheads ,
AMPC	Revelation	13	17	So that no one will have power to buy or sell unless he bears the stamp ( mark , inscription ) , [ that is ] the name of the beast or the number of his name .
AMPC	Revelation	13	18	Here is [ room for ] discernment [ a call for the wisdom [ d ] of interpretation ] . Let anyone who has intelligence ( penetration and insight enough ) calculate the number of the beast , for it is a human number [ the number of a certain man ] ; his number is

AMPC	Revelation	14	14	Again I looked , and behold , [ I saw ] a white cloud , and sitting on the cloud [ h ] One resembling a Son of Man , with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp scythe ( sickle ) in His hand . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of mighty thunder ; the voice I heard [ seemed like the music ] of harpists [ a ] accompanying themselves on their harps .
AMPC	Revelation	14	3	And they sang a new song before the throne [ of God ] and before the four living creatures and before the elders [ of [ b ] the heavenly Sanhedrin ] . No one could learn [ to sing ] that song except the 144,000 who had been ransomed ( purchased , redeemed ) from the earth .
AMPC	Revelation	14	4	These are they who have not defiled themselves by relations with women , for they are [ [ c ] pure as ] virgins . These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes . These are they who have been ransomed ( purchased , redeemed ) from among men as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb .
AMPC	Revelation	14	5	No lie was found to be upon their lips , for they are blameless ( spotless , untainted , without blemish ) before the throne of God .
AMPC	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying in midair , with an eternal Gospel ( good news ) to tell to the inhabitants of the earth , to every race and tribe and language and people .
AMPC	Revelation	14	7	And he cried with a mighty voice , Revere God and give Him glory ( honor and praise in worship ) , for the hour of His judgment has arrived . Fall down before Him ; pay Him homage and adoration and worship Him Who created heaven and earth , the sea and the springs ( fountains ) of water .
AMPC	Revelation	14	8	Then another angel , a second , followed , declaring , Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great ! She who made all nations drink of the [ maddening ] wine of her passionate unchastity [ [ d ] idolatry ] . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	14	9	Then another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a mighty voice , Whoever pays homage to the beast and his statue and permits the [ beast ’ s ] stamp ( mark , inscription ) to be put on his forehead or on his hand ,
AMPC	Revelation	14	10	He too shall [ have to ] drink of the wine of God ’ s indignation and wrath , poured undiluted into the cup of His anger ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever ; and they have no respite ( no pause , no intermission , no rest , no peace ) day or night—these who pay homage to the beast and to his image and whoever receives the stamp of his name upon him . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	14	12	Here [ comes in a call for ] the steadfastness of the saints [ the patience , the endurance of the people of God ] , those who [ habitually ] keep God ’ s commandments and [ their ] faith in Jesus .
AMPC	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard further [ [ e ] perceiving the distinct words of ] a voice from heaven , saying , Write this : Blessed ( happy , [ f ] to be envied ) are the dead from now on who die in the Lord ! Yes , blessed ( happy , [ g ] to be envied indeed ) , says the Spirit , [ in ] that they may rest from their labors , for their works ( deeds ) do follow ( attend , accompany ) them !
AMPC	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple sanctuary , calling with a mighty voice to Him Who was sitting upon the cloud , Put in Your scythe and reap , for the hour has arrived to gather the harvest , for the earth ’ s crop is fully ripened . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	14	16	So He Who was sitting upon the cloud swung His scythe ( sickle ) on the earth , and the earth ’ s crop was harvested .
AMPC	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the temple [ sanctuary ] in heaven , and he also carried a sharp scythe ( sickle ) .
AMPC	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came forth from the altar , [ the angel ] who has authority and power over fire , and he called with a loud cry to him who had the sharp scythe ( sickle ) , Put forth your scythe and reap the fruitage of the vine of the earth , for its grapes are entirely ripe .
AMPC	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his scythe on the earth and stripped the grapes and gathered the vintage from the vines of the earth and cast it into the huge winepress of God ’ s indignation and wrath .
AMPC	Revelation	14	20	And [ the grapes in ] the winepress were trodden outside the city , and blood poured from the winepress , [ reaching ] as high as horses ’ bridles , for a distance of 1,600 stadia ( about
AMPC	Revelation	14	200	miles ) . ( F ) Footnotes - Revelation 14:2 Marvin Vincent , Word Studies . - Revelation 14:3 George R.

AMPC	Revelation	15	15	Then I saw another wonder ( sign , token , symbol ) in heaven , great and marvelous [ warning of events of ominous significance ] : There were seven angels bringing seven plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) , which are the last , for with them God ’ s wrath ( indignation ) is completely expressed [ reaches its climax and is ended ] . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	15	2	Then I saw what seemed to be a glassy sea blended with fire , and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his statue and from the number corresponding to his name were standing beside the glassy sea , with harps of God in their hands .
AMPC	Revelation	15	3	And they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb , saying , Mighty and marvelous are Your works , O Lord God the Omnipotent ! Righteous ( just ) and true are Your ways , O Sovereign of the ages ( King of the [ a ] nations ) ! ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	15	4	Who shall not reverence and glorify Your name , O Lord [ giving You honor and praise in worship ] ? For You only are holy . All the nations shall come and pay homage and adoration to You , for Your just judgments ( Your righteous sentences and deeds ) have been made known and displayed . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	15	5	After this I looked and the sanctuary of the tent of the testimony in heaven was thrown open ,
AMPC	Revelation	15	6	And there came out of the temple sanctuary the seven angels bringing the seven plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) . They were arrayed in pure gleaming linen , and around their breasts they wore golden girdles .
AMPC	Revelation	15	7	And one of the four living creatures [ then ] gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath and indignation of God , Who lives forever and ever ( in the eternities of the eternities ) .
AMPC	Revelation	15	8	And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory ( the radiance , the splendor ) of God and from His might and power , and no one was able to go into the sanctuary until the seven plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) of the seven angels were ended .

AMPC	Revelation	16	16	And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon . ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	16	2	So the first [ angel ] went and emptied his bowl on the earth , and foul and painful ulcers ( sores ) came on the people who were marked with the stamp of the beast and who did homage to his image . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	16	3	The second [ angel ] emptied his bowl into the sea , and it turned into blood like that of a corpse [ thick , corrupt , ill-smelling , and disgusting ] , and every living thing that was in the sea perished .
AMPC	Revelation	16	4	Then the third [ angel ] emptied out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water , and they turned into ( became ) blood . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	16	5	And I also heard the angel of the waters say , Righteous ( just ) are You in these Your decisions and judgments , You Who are and were , O Holy One !
AMPC	Revelation	16	6	Because they have poured out the blood of Your people ( the saints ) and the prophets , and You have given them blood to drink . Such is their due [ they deserve it ] ! ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	16	7	And [ from ] the altar I heard [ the ] cry , Yes , Lord God the Omnipotent , Your judgments ( sentences , decisions ) are true and just and righteous ! ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	16	8	Then the fourth [ angel ] emptied out his bowl upon the sun , and it was permitted to burn ( scorch ) humanity with [ fierce , glowing ] heat ( fire ) .
AMPC	Revelation	16	9	People were severely burned ( scorched ) by the fiery heat , and they reviled and blasphemed the name of God , Who has control of these plagues , and they did not repent of their sins [ felt no regret , contrition , and compunction for their waywardness , refusing to amend their ways ] to give Him glory .
AMPC	Revelation	16	10	Then the fifth [ angel ] emptied his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was [ plunged ] in darkness ; and people gnawed their tongues for the torment [ of their excruciating distress and severe pain ] ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	16	11	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their anguish and their ulcers ( sores ) , and they did not deplore their wicked deeds or repent [ for what they had done ] .
AMPC	Revelation	16	12	Then the sixth [ angel ] emptied his bowl on the mighty river Euphrates , and its water was dried up to make ready a road for [ the coming of ] the kings of the east ( from the rising sun ) . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	16	13	And I saw three loathsome spirits like frogs , [ leaping ] from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	16	14	For really they are the spirits of demons that perform signs ( wonders , miracles ) . And they go forth to the rulers and leaders all over the world , to gather them together for war on the great day of God the Almighty .
AMPC	Revelation	16	15	Behold , I am going to come like a thief ! Blessed ( happy , [ a ] to be envied ) is he who stays awake ( alert ) and who guards his clothes , so that he may not be naked and [ have the shame of being ] seen exposed !
AMPC	Revelation	16	17	Then the seventh [ angel ] emptied out his bowl into the air , and a mighty voice came out of the sanctuary of heaven from the throne [ of God ] , saying , It is done ! [ It is all over , it is all accomplished , it has come ! ] ( J )
AMPC	Revelation	16	18	And there followed lightning flashes , loud rumblings , peals of thunder , and a tremendous earthquake ; nothing like it has ever occurred since men dwelt on the earth , so severe and far-reaching was that earthquake . ( K )
AMPC	Revelation	16	19	The mighty city was broken into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell . And God kept in mind mighty Babylon , to make her drain the cup of His furious wrath and indignation .
AMPC	Revelation	16	20	And every island fled and no mountains could be found .
AMPC	Revelation	16	21	And great ( excessively oppressive ) hailstones , as heavy as a talent [ between fifty and sixty pounds ] , of immense size , fell from the sky on the people ; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail , so very great was [ the torture ] of that plague .

AMPC	Revelation	17	17	For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His own purpose by acting in harmony in surrendering their royal power and authority to the beast , until the prophetic words ( intentions and promises ) of God shall be fulfilled .
AMPC	Revelation	17	2	[ She ] with whom the rulers of the earth have joined in prostitution ( idolatry ) and with the wine of whose immorality ( idolatry ) the inhabitants of the earth have become intoxicated . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	17	3	And [ the angel ] bore me away [ rapt ] in the Spirit into a desert ( wilderness ) , and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles ( names ) , and he had seven heads and ten horns .
AMPC	Revelation	17	4	The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold , precious stones , and pearls , [ and she was ] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness and vice . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	17	5	And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [ with a secret symbolic meaning ] : Babylon the great , the mother of prostitutes ( idolatresses ) and of the filth and atrocities and abominations of the earth .
AMPC	Revelation	17	6	I also saw that the woman was drunk , [ drunk ] with the blood of the saints ( God ’ s people ) and the blood of the martyrs [ who witnessed ] for Jesus . And when I saw her , I was utterly amazed and wondered greatly .
AMPC	Revelation	17	7	But the angel said to me , Why do you wonder ? I will explain to you the [ secret symbolic meaning of the ] mystery of the woman , as well as of the beast having the seven heads and ten horns that carries her .
AMPC	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw [ once ] was , but [ now ] is no more , and he is going to come up out of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) and proceed to go to perdition . And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been recorded in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they look at the beast , because he [ once ] was , but [ now ] is no more , and he is [ yet ] to come . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	17	9	This calls for a mind [ to consider that is packed ] with wisdom and intelligence [ it is something for a particular mode of thinking and judging of thoughts , feelings , and purposes ] . The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman is sitting ;
AMPC	Revelation	17	10	And they are also seven kings , five of whom have fallen , one still exists [ and is reigning ] ; the other [ the seventh ] has not yet appeared , and when he does arrive , he must stay [ but ] a brief time .
AMPC	Revelation	17	11	And as for the beast that [ once ] was , but now is no more , he [ himself ] is an eighth ruler ( king , head ) , but he is of the seven and belongs to them , and he goes to perdition .
AMPC	Revelation	17	12	Also the ten horns that you observed are ten rulers ( kings ) who have as yet received no royal dominion , but together they are to receive power and authority as rulers for a single hour , along with the beast . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	17	13	These have one common policy ( opinion , purpose ) , and they deliver their power and authority to the beast .
AMPC	Revelation	17	14	They will wage war against the Lamb , and the Lamb will triumph over them ; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings—and those with Him and on His side are chosen and called [ elected ] and loyal and faithful followers . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	17	15	And [ the angel further ] said to me , The waters that you observed , where the harlot is seated , are races and multitudes and nations and dialects ( languages ) .
AMPC	Revelation	17	16	And the ten horns that you saw , they and the beast will [ be the very ones to ] hate the harlot ( the idolatrous woman ) ; they will make her cheerless ( bereaved , desolate ) , and they will strip her and eat up her flesh and utterly consume her with fire .
AMPC	Revelation	17	18	And the woman that you saw is herself the great city which dominates and controls the rulers and the leaders of the earth . Copyright ©

AMPC	Revelation	18	18	And exclaimed as they watched the smoke of her burning , What city could be compared to the great city !
AMPC	Revelation	18	2	And he shouted with a mighty voice , She is fallen ! Mighty Babylon is fallen ! She has become a resort and dwelling place for demons , a dungeon haunted by every loathsome spirit , an abode for every filthy and detestable bird .
AMPC	Revelation	18	3	For all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate unchastity , and the rulers and leaders of the earth have joined with her in committing fornication ( idolatry ) , and the businessmen of the earth have become rich with the wealth of her excessive luxury and wantonness . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	18	4	I then heard another voice from heaven saying , Come out from her , my people , so that you may not share in her sins , neither participate in her plagues . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	18	5	For her iniquities ( her crimes and transgressions ) are piled up as high as heaven , and God has remembered her wickedness and [ her ] crimes [ and calls them up for settlement ] . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	18	6	Repay to her what she herself has paid [ to others ] and double [ her doom ] in accordance with what she has done . Mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed [ for others ] . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	18	7	To the degree that she glorified herself and reveled in her wantonness [ living deliciously and luxuriously ] , to that measure impose on her torment and anguish and tears and mourning . Since in her heart she boasts , I am not a widow ; as a queen [ on a throne ] I sit , and I shall never see suffering or experience sorrow— ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	18	8	So shall her plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) come thick upon her in a single day , pestilence and anguish and sorrow and famine ; and she shall be utterly consumed ( burned up with fire ) , for mighty is the Lord God Who judges her .
AMPC	Revelation	18	9	And the rulers and leaders of the earth who joined her in her immorality ( idolatry ) and luxuriated with her will weep and beat their breasts and lament over her when they see the smoke of her conflagration . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	18	10	They will stand a long way off , in terror of her torment , and they will cry , Woe and alas , the great city , the mighty city , Babylon ! In one single hour how your doom ( judgment ) has overtaken you !
AMPC	Revelation	18	11	And earth ’ s businessmen will weep and grieve over her because no one buys their freight ( cargo ) any more . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	18	12	Their merchandise is of gold , silver , precious stones , and pearls ; of fine linen , purple , silk , and scarlet [ stuffs ] ; all kinds of scented wood , all sorts of articles of ivory , all varieties of objects of costly woods , bronze , iron , and marble ; ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	18	13	Of cinnamon , spices , incense , ointment and perfume , and frankincense , of wine and olive oil , fine flour and wheat ; of cattle and sheep , horses and conveyances ; and of slaves ( the bodies ) and souls of men !
AMPC	Revelation	18	14	The ripe fruits and delicacies for which your soul longed have gone from you , and all your luxuries and dainties , your elegance and splendor are lost to you , never again to be recovered or experienced !
AMPC	Revelation	18	15	The dealers who handled these articles , who grew wealthy through their business with her , will stand a long way off , in terror of her doom and torment , weeping and grieving aloud , and saying ,
AMPC	Revelation	18	16	Alas , alas for the great city that was robed in fine linen , in purple and scarlet , bedecked and glittering with gold , with precious stones , and with pearls ! ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	18	17	Because in one [ single ] hour all the vast wealth has been destroyed ( wiped out ) . And all ship captains and pilots , navigators and all who live by seafaring , the crews and all who ply their trade on the sea , stood a long way off , ( J )
AMPC	Revelation	18	19	And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and grieved , exclaiming , Woe and alas , for the great city , where all who had ships on the sea grew rich [ through her extravagance ] from her great wealth ! In one single hour she has been destroyed and has become a desert ! ( K )
AMPC	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice ( celebrate ) over her , O heaven ! O saints ( people of God ) and apostles and prophets , because God has executed vengeance for you upon her ! ( L )
AMPC	Revelation	18	21	Then a single powerful angel took up a boulder like a great millstone and flung it into the sea , crying , With such violence shall Babylon the great city be hurled down to destruction and shall never again be found . ( M )
AMPC	Revelation	18	22	And the sound of harpists and minstrels and flute players and trumpeters shall never again be heard in you , and no skilled artisan of any craft shall ever again be found in you , and the sound of the millstone shall never again be heard in you . ( N )
AMPC	Revelation	18	23	And never again shall the light of a lamp shine in you , and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall never be heard in you again ; for your businessmen were the great and prominent men of the earth , and by your magic spells and poisonous charm all nations were led astray ( seduced and deluded ) .
AMPC	Revelation	18	24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints , and of all those who have been slain ( slaughtered ) on earth . ( O ) Copyright ©

AMPC	Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the beast and the rulers and leaders of the earth with their troops mustered to go into battle and make war against Him Who is mounted on the horse and against His troops .
AMPC	Revelation	19	2	Because His judgments ( His condemnation and punishment , His sentences of doom ) are true and sound and just and upright . He has judged ( convicted , pronounced sentence , and doomed ) the great and notorious harlot ( idolatress ) who corrupted and demoralized and poisoned the earth with her lewdness and adultery ( idolatry ) . And He has avenged ( visited on her the penalty for ) the blood of His servants at her hand . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	19	3	And again they shouted , Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) ! The smoke of her [ burning ] shall continue to ascend forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	19	4	Then the twenty-four elders [ of [ a ] the heavenly Sanhedrin ] and the four living creatures fell prostrate and worshiped [ paying divine honors to ] God , Who sits on the throne , saying , Amen ! Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) !
AMPC	Revelation	19	5	Then from the throne there came a voice , saying , Praise our God , all you servants of His , you who reverence Him , both small and great ! ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	19	6	After that I heard what sounded like the shout of a vast throng , like the boom of many pounding waves , and like the roar of terrific and mighty peals of thunder , exclaiming , Hallelujah ( praise the Lord ) ! For now the Lord our God the Omnipotent ( the All-Ruler ) reigns !
AMPC	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and shout for joy [ exulting and triumphant ] ! Let us celebrate and ascribe to Him glory and honor , for the marriage of the Lamb [ at last ] has come , and His bride has prepared herself . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	19	8	She has been permitted to dress in fine ( radiant ) linen , dazzling and white—for the fine linen is ( signifies , represents ) the righteousness ( the upright , just , and godly living , deeds , and conduct , and right standing with God ) of the saints ( God ’ s holy people ) .
AMPC	Revelation	19	9	Then [ the angel ] said to me , Write this down : Blessed ( happy , [ b ] to be envied ) are those who are summoned ( invited , called ) to the marriage supper of the Lamb . And he said to me [ further ] , These are the true words ( the genuine and exact declarations ) of God .
AMPC	Revelation	19	10	Then I fell prostrate at his feet to worship ( to pay divine honors ) to him , but he [ restrained me ] and said , Refrain ! [ You must not do that ! ] I am [ only ] another servant with you and your brethren who have [ accepted and hold ] the testimony borne by Jesus . Worship God ! For the substance ( essence ) of the truth revealed by Jesus is the spirit of all prophecy [ the vital breath , the inspiration of all inspired preaching and interpretation of the divine will and purpose , including both mine and yours ] .
AMPC	Revelation	19	11	After that I saw heaven opened , and behold , a white horse [ appeared ] ! The One Who was riding it is called Faithful ( Trustworthy , Loyal , Incorruptible , Steady ) and True , and He passes judgment and wages war in righteousness ( holiness , justice , and uprightness ) . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	19	12	His eyes [ blaze ] like a flame of fire , and on His head are many kingly crowns ( diadems ) ; and He has a title ( name ) inscribed which He alone knows or can understand . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	19	13	He is dressed in a robe dyed by [ c ] dipping in blood , and the title by which He is called is The Word of God .
AMPC	Revelation	19	14	And the troops of heaven , clothed in fine linen , dazzling and clean , followed Him on white horses .
AMPC	Revelation	19	15	From His mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which He can smite ( afflict , strike ) the nations ; and He will shepherd and control them with a staff ( scepter , rod ) of iron . He will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath and indignation of God the All-Ruler ( the Almighty , the Omnipotent ) . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	19	16	And on His garment ( robe ) and on His thigh He has a name ( title ) inscribed , king of kings and lord of lords . ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw a single angel stationed in the sun ’ s [ d ] light , and with a mighty voice he shouted to all the birds that fly across the sky , Come , gather yourselves together for the great supper of God , ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	19	18	That you may feast on the flesh of rulers , the flesh of generals and captains , the flesh of powerful and mighty men , the flesh of horses and their riders , and the flesh of all humanity , both free and slave , both small and great !
AMPC	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was seized and overpowered , and with him the false prophet who in his presence had worked wonders and performed miracles by which he led astray those who had accepted or permitted to be placed upon them the stamp ( mark ) of the beast and those who paid homage and gave divine honors to his statue . Both of them were hurled alive into the fiery lake that burns and blazes with brimstone .
AMPC	Revelation	19	21	And the rest were killed with the sword that issues from the mouth of Him Who is mounted on the horse , and all the birds fed ravenously and glutted themselves with their flesh .

AMPC	Revelation	20	20	Then I saw an angel descending from heaven ; he was holding the key of the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) and a great chain was in his hand .
AMPC	Revelation	20	2	And he gripped and overpowered the dragon , that old serpent [ of primeval times ] , who is the devil and Satan , and [ securely ] bound him for a thousand years .
AMPC	Revelation	20	3	Then he hurled him into the Abyss ( the bottomless pit ) and closed it and sealed it above him , so that he should no longer lead astray and deceive and seduce the nations until the thousand years were at an end . After that he must be liberated for a short time .
AMPC	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw thrones , and sitting on them were those to whom authority to act as judges and to pass sentence was entrusted . Also I saw the souls of those who had been slain with axes [ beheaded ] for their witnessing to Jesus and [ for preaching and testifying ] for the Word of God , and who had refused to pay homage to the beast or his statue and had not accepted his mark or permitted it to be stamped on their foreheads or on their hands . And they lived again and ruled with Christ ( the Messiah ) a thousand years . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	20	5	The remainder of the dead were not restored to life again until the thousand years were completed . This is the first resurrection .
AMPC	Revelation	20	6	Blessed ( happy , [ a ] to be envied ) and holy ( spiritually whole , of unimpaired innocence and proved virtue ) is the person who takes part ( shares ) in the first resurrection ! Over them the second death exerts no power or authority , but they shall be ministers of God and of Christ ( the Messiah ) , and they shall rule along with Him a thousand years .
AMPC	Revelation	20	7	And when the thousand years are completed , Satan will be released from his place of confinement ,
AMPC	Revelation	20	8	And he will go forth to deceive and seduce and lead astray the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth—Gog and Magog—to muster them for war ; their number is like the sand of the sea . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	20	9	And they swarmed up over the broad plain of the earth and encircled the fortress ( camp ) of God ’ s people ( the saints ) and the beloved city ; but fire descended from heaven and consumed them . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	20	10	Then the devil who had led them astray [ deceiving and seducing them ] was hurled into the fiery lake of burning brimstone , where the beast and false prophet were ; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever ( through the ages of the ages ) .
AMPC	Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne and the One Who was seated upon it , from Whose presence and from the sight of Whose face earth and sky fled away , and no place was found for them .
AMPC	Revelation	20	12	I [ also ] saw the dead , great and small ; they stood before the throne , and books were opened . Then another book was opened , which is [ the Book ] of Life . And the dead were judged ( sentenced ) by what they had done [ [ b ] their whole way of feeling and acting , their aims and endeavors ] in accordance with what was recorded in the books .
AMPC	Revelation	20	13	And the sea delivered up the dead who were in it , death and Hades ( [ c ] the state of death or disembodied existence ) surrendered the dead in them , and all were tried and their cases determined by what they had done [ according to their motives , aims , and works ] .
AMPC	Revelation	20	14	Then death and Hades ( [ d ] the state of death or disembodied existence ) were thrown into the lake of fire . This is the second death , the lake of fire .
AMPC	Revelation	20	15	And if anyone ’ s [ name ] was not found recorded in the Book of Life , he was hurled into the lake of fire .

AMPC	Revelation	21	21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls , each separate gate being built of one solid pearl . And the main street ( the broadway ) of the city was of gold as pure and translucent as glass .
AMPC	Revelation	21	2	And I saw the holy city , the new Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God , all arrayed like a bride beautified and adorned for her husband ;
AMPC	Revelation	21	3	Then I heard a mighty voice from the throne and I perceived its distinct words , saying , See ! The abode of God is with men , and He will live ( encamp , tent ) among them ; and they shall be His people , and God shall personally be with them and be their God . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	21	4	God will wipe away every tear from their eyes ; and death shall be no more , neither shall there be anguish ( sorrow and mourning ) nor grief nor pain any more , for the old conditions and the former order of things have passed away . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	21	5	And He Who is seated on the throne said , See ! I make all things new . Also He said , Record this , for these sayings are faithful ( accurate , incorruptible , and trustworthy ) and true ( genuine ) . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	21	6	And He [ further ] said to me , It is done ! I am the Alpha and the Omega , the Beginning and the End . To the thirsty I [ Myself ] will give water without price from the fountain ( springs ) of the water of Life . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	21	7	He who is victorious shall inherit all these things , and I will be God to him and he shall be My son .
AMPC	Revelation	21	8	But as for the cowards and the ignoble and the contemptible and the cravenly lacking in courage and the cowardly submissive , and as for the unbelieving and faithless , and as for the depraved and defiled with abominations , and as for murderers and the lewd and adulterous and the practicers of magic arts and the idolaters ( those who give supreme devotion to anyone or anything other than God ) and all liars ( those who knowingly convey untruth by word or deed ) — [ all of these shall have ] their part in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone . This is the second death . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven final plagues ( afflictions , calamities ) came and spoke to me . He said , Come with me ! I will show you the bride , the Lamb ’ s wife .
AMPC	Revelation	21	10	Then in the Spirit He conveyed me away to a vast and lofty mountain and exhibited to me the holy ( hallowed , consecrated ) city of Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God , ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	21	11	Clothed in God ’ s glory [ in all its splendor and radiance ] . The luster of it resembled a rare and most precious jewel , like jasper , shining clear as crystal .
AMPC	Revelation	21	12	It had a massive and high wall with twelve [ large ] gates , and at the gates [ there were stationed ] twelve angels , and [ on the gates ] the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were written : ( H )
AMPC	Revelation	21	13	On the east side three gates , on the north side three gates , on the south side three gates , and on the west side three gates .
AMPC	Revelation	21	14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundation [ stones ] , and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
AMPC	Revelation	21	15	And he who spoke to me had a golden measuring reed ( rod ) to measure the city and its gates and its wall . ( I )
AMPC	Revelation	21	16	The city lies in a square , its length being the same as its width . And he measured the city with his reed—12,000 stadia ( about 1,500 miles ) ; its length and width and height are the same .
AMPC	Revelation	21	17	He measured its wall also—144 cubits ( about
AMPC	Revelation	21	72	yards ) by a man ’ s measure [ [ c ] of a cubit from his elbow to his third fingertip ] , which is [ the measure ] of the angel .
AMPC	Revelation	21	18	The wall was built of jasper , while the city [ itself was of ] pure gold , clear and transparent like glass .
AMPC	Revelation	21	19	The foundation [ stones ] of the wall of the city were ornamented with all of the precious stones . The first foundation [ stone ] was jasper , the second sapphire , the third chalcedony ( or white agate ) , the fourth emerald , ( J )
AMPC	Revelation	21	20	The fifth onyx , the sixth sardius , the seventh chrysolite , the eighth beryl , the ninth topaz , the tenth chrysoprase , the eleventh jacinth , the twelfth amethyst .
AMPC	Revelation	21	22	I saw no temple in the city , for the Lord God Omnipotent [ Himself ] and the Lamb [ Himself ] are its temple .
AMPC	Revelation	21	23	And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to give light to it , for the splendor and radiance ( glory ) of God illuminate it , and the Lamb is its lamp . ( K )
AMPC	Revelation	21	24	The nations shall walk by its light and the rulers and leaders of the earth shall bring into it their glory .
AMPC	Revelation	21	25	And its gates shall never be closed by day , and there shall be no night there . ( L )
AMPC	Revelation	21	26	They shall bring the glory ( the splendor and majesty ) and the honor of the nations into it .
AMPC	Revelation	21	27	But nothing that defiles or profanes or is [ d ] unwashed shall ever enter it , nor anyone who commits abominations ( unclean , detestable , morally repugnant things ) or practices falsehood , but only those whose names are recorded in the Lamb ’ s Book of Life .

AMPC	Revelation	22	22	Then he showed me the river whose waters give life , sparkling like crystal , flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb
AMPC	Revelation	22	2	Through the middle of the broadway of the city ; also , on either side of the river was the tree of life with its twelve varieties of fruit , yielding each month its fresh crop ; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing and the restoration of the nations . ( A )
AMPC	Revelation	22	3	There shall no longer exist there anything that is accursed ( detestable , foul , offensive , impure , hateful , or horrible ) . But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it , and His servants shall worship Him [ pay divine honors to Him and do Him holy service ] . ( B )
AMPC	Revelation	22	4	They shall see His face , and His name shall be on their foreheads . ( C )
AMPC	Revelation	22	5	And there shall be no more night ; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight , for the Lord God will illuminate them and be their light , and they shall reign [ as kings ] forever and ever ( through the eternities of the eternities ) .
AMPC	Revelation	22	6	And he [ of the seven angels further ] said to me , These statements are reliable ( worthy of confidence ) and genuine ( true ) . And the Lord , the God of the spirits of the prophets , has sent His messenger ( angel ) to make known and exhibit to His servants what must soon come to pass .
AMPC	Revelation	22	7	And behold , I am coming speedily . Blessed ( happy and [ a ] to be envied ) is he who observes and lays to heart and keeps the truths of the prophecy ( the predictions , consolations , and warnings ) contained in this [ little ] book .
AMPC	Revelation	22	8	And I , John , am he who heard and witnessed these things . And when I heard and saw them , I fell prostrate before the feet of the messenger ( angel ) who showed them to me , to worship him .
AMPC	Revelation	22	9	But he said to me , Refrain ! [ You must not do that ! ] I am [ only ] a fellow servant along with yourself and with your brethren the prophets and with those who are mindful of and practice [ the truths contained in ] the messages of this book . Worship God !
AMPC	Revelation	22	10	And he [ further ] told me , Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book and make no secret of them , for the time [ b ] when things are brought to a crisis and the period of their fulfillment is near .
AMPC	Revelation	22	11	He who is unrighteous ( unjust , wicked ) , let him be unrighteous still ; and he who is filthy ( vile , impure ) , let him be filthy still ; and he who is righteous ( just , upright , in right standing with God ) , let him do right still ; and he who is holy , let him be holy still . ( D )
AMPC	Revelation	22	12	Behold , I am coming soon , and I shall bring My wages and rewards with Me , to repay and render to each one just what his own actions and his own work merit . ( E )
AMPC	Revelation	22	13	I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last ( the Before all and the End of all ) . ( F )
AMPC	Revelation	22	14	Blessed ( happy and [ c ] to be envied ) are those who cleanse their garments , that they may have the authority and right to [ approach ] the tree of life and to enter through the gates into the city . ( G )
AMPC	Revelation	22	15	[ But ] without are the dogs and those who practice sorceries ( magic arts ) and impurity [ the lewd , adulterers ] and the murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and deals in falsehood ( untruth , error , deception , cheating ) .
