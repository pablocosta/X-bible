NCV	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the sky and the earth .
NCV	Genesis	1	2	The earth was empty and had no form . Darkness covered the ocean , and God ’ s Spirit was moving over the water .
NCV	Genesis	1	3	Then God said , “ Let there be light , ” and there was light .
NCV	Genesis	1	4	God saw that the light was good , so he divided the light from the darkness .
NCV	Genesis	1	5	God named the light “ day ” and the darkness “ night. ” Evening passed , and morning came . This was the first day .
NCV	Genesis	1	6	Then God said , “ Let there be something to divide the water in two. ”
NCV	Genesis	1	7	So God made the air and placed some of the water above the air and some below it .
NCV	Genesis	1	8	God named the air “ sky. ” Evening passed , and morning came . This was the second day .
NCV	Genesis	1	9	Then God said , “ Let the water under the sky be gathered together so the dry land will appear. ” And it happened .
NCV	Genesis	1	10	God named the dry land “ earth ” and the water that was gathered together “ seas. ” God saw that this was good .
NCV	Genesis	1	11	Then God said , “ Let the earth produce plants—some to make grain for seeds and others to make fruits with seeds in them . Every seed will produce more of its own kind of plant. ” And it happened .
NCV	Genesis	1	12	The earth produced plants with grain for seeds and trees that made fruits with seeds in them . Each seed grew its own kind of plant . God saw that all this was good .
NCV	Genesis	1	13	Evening passed , and morning came . This was the third day .
NCV	Genesis	1	14	Then God said , “ Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night . These lights will be used for signs , seasons , days , and years .
NCV	Genesis	1	15	They will be in the sky to give light to the earth. ” And it happened .
NCV	Genesis	1	16	So God made the two large lights . He made the brighter light to rule the day and made the smaller light to rule the night . He also made the stars .
NCV	Genesis	1	17	God put all these in the sky to shine on the earth ,
NCV	Genesis	1	18	to rule over the day and over the night , and to separate the light from the darkness . God saw that all these things were good .
NCV	Genesis	1	19	Evening passed , and morning came . This was the fourth day .
NCV	Genesis	1	20	Then God said , “ Let the water be filled with living things , and let birds fly in the air above the earth. ”
NCV	Genesis	1	21	So God created the large sea animals and every living thing that moves in the sea . The sea is filled with these living things , with each one producing more of its own kind . He also made every bird that flies , and each bird produced more of its own kind . God saw that this was good .
NCV	Genesis	1	22	God blessed them and said , “ Have many young ones so that you may grow in number . Fill the water of the seas , and let the birds grow in number on the earth. ”
NCV	Genesis	1	23	Evening passed , and morning came . This was the fifth day .
NCV	Genesis	1	24	Then God said , “ Let the earth be filled with animals , each producing more of its own kind . Let there be tame animals and small crawling animals and wild animals , and let each produce more of its kind. ” And it happened .
NCV	Genesis	1	25	So God made the wild animals , the tame animals , and all the small crawling animals to produce more of their own kind . God saw that this was good .
NCV	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , “ Let us make human beings in our image and likeness . And let them rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky , over the tame animals , over all the earth , and over all the small crawling animals on the earth. ”
NCV	Genesis	1	27	So God created human beings in his image . In the image of God he created them . He created them male and female .
NCV	Genesis	1	28	God blessed them and said , “ Have many children and grow in number . Fill the earth and be its master . Rule over the fish in the sea and over the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth. ”
NCV	Genesis	1	29	God said , “ Look , I have given you all the plants that have grain for seeds and all the trees whose fruits have seeds in them . They will be food for you .
NCV	Genesis	1	30	I have given all the green plants as food for every wild animal , every bird of the air , and every small crawling animal. ” And it happened .
NCV	Genesis	1	31	God looked at everything he had made , and it was very good . Evening passed , and morning came . This was the sixth day . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	2	2	By the seventh day God finished the work he had been doing , so he rested from all his work .
NCV	Genesis	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and made it a holy day , because on that day he rested from all the work he had done in creating the world . The First People
NCV	Genesis	2	4	This is the story of the creation of the sky and the earth . When the Lord God first made the earth and the sky ,
NCV	Genesis	2	5	there were still no plants on the earth . Nothing was growing in the fields because the Lord God had not yet made it rain on the land . And there was no person to care for the ground ,
NCV	Genesis	2	6	but a mist would rise up from the earth and water all the ground .
NCV	Genesis	2	7	Then the Lord God took dust from the ground and formed a man from it . He breathed the breath of life into the man ’ s nose , and the man became a living person .
NCV	Genesis	2	8	Then the Lord God planted a garden in the east , in a place called Eden , and put the man he had formed into it .
NCV	Genesis	2	9	The Lord God caused every beautiful tree and every tree that was good for food to grow out of the ground . In the middle of the garden , God put the tree that gives life and also the tree that gives the knowledge of good and evil .
NCV	Genesis	2	10	A river flowed through Eden and watered the garden . From there the river branched out to become four rivers .
NCV	Genesis	2	11	The first river , named Pishon , flows around the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold .
NCV	Genesis	2	12	The gold of that land is excellent . Bdellium and onyx [ a ] are also found there .
NCV	Genesis	2	13	The second river , named Gihon , flows around the whole land of Cush .
NCV	Genesis	2	14	The third river , named Tigris , flows out of Assyria toward the east . The fourth river is the Euphrates .
NCV	Genesis	2	15	The Lord God put the man in the garden of Eden to care for it and work it .
NCV	Genesis	2	16	The Lord God commanded him , “ You may eat the fruit from any tree in the garden ,
NCV	Genesis	2	17	but you must not eat the fruit from the tree which gives the knowledge of good and evil . If you ever eat fruit from that tree , you will die ! ” The First Woman
NCV	Genesis	2	18	Then the Lord God said , “ It is not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper who is right for him. ”
NCV	Genesis	2	19	From the ground God formed every wild animal and every bird in the sky , and he brought them to the man so the man could name them . Whatever the man called each living thing , that became its name .
NCV	Genesis	2	20	The man gave names to all the tame animals , to the birds in the sky , and to all the wild animals . But Adam [ b ] did not find a helper that was right for him .
NCV	Genesis	2	21	So the Lord God caused the man to sleep very deeply , and while he was asleep , God removed one of the man ’ s ribs . Then God closed up the man ’ s skin at the place where he took the rib .
NCV	Genesis	2	22	The Lord God used the rib from the man to make a woman , and then he brought the woman to the man .
NCV	Genesis	2	23	And the man said , “ Now , this is someone whose bones came from my bones , whose body came from my body . I will call her ‘ woman , ’ because she was taken out of man. ”
NCV	Genesis	2	24	So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife , and the two will become one body .

NCV	Genesis	3	3	But God told us , ‘ You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden . You must not even touch it , or you will die. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	3	2	The woman answered the snake , “ We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden .
NCV	Genesis	3	4	But the snake said to the woman , “ You will not die .
NCV	Genesis	3	5	God knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree , you will learn about good and evil and you will be like God ! ”
NCV	Genesis	3	6	The woman saw that the tree was beautiful , that its fruit was good to eat , and that it would make her wise . So she took some of its fruit and ate it . She also gave some of the fruit to her husband who was with her , and he ate it .
NCV	Genesis	3	7	Then , it was as if their eyes were opened . They realized they were naked , so they sewed fig leaves together and made something to cover themselves .
NCV	Genesis	3	8	Then they heard the Lord God walking in the garden during the cool part of the day , and the man and his wife hid from the Lord God among the trees in the garden .
NCV	Genesis	3	9	But the Lord God called to the man and said , “ Where are you ? ”
NCV	Genesis	3	10	The man answered , “ I heard you walking in the garden , and I was afraid because I was naked , so I hid. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	11	God asked , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Did you eat fruit from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat ? ”
NCV	Genesis	3	12	The man said , “ You gave this woman to me and she gave me fruit from the tree , so I ate it. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	13	Then the Lord God said to the woman , “ How could you have done such a thing ? ” She answered , “ The snake tricked me , so I ate the fruit. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	14	The Lord God said to the snake , “ Because you did this , a curse will be put on you . You will be cursed as no other animal , tame or wild , will ever be . You will crawl on your stomach , and you will eat dust all the days of your life .
NCV	Genesis	3	15	I will make you and the woman enemies to each other . Your descendants and her descendants will be enemies . One of her descendants will crush your head , and you will bite his heel. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	16	Then God said to the woman , “ I will cause you to have much trouble when you are pregnant , and when you give birth to children , you will have great pain . You will greatly desire your husband , but he will rule over you. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	17	Then God said to the man , “ You listened to what your wife said , and you ate fruit from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat . “ So I will put a curse on the ground , and you will have to work very hard for your food . In pain you will eat its food all the days of your life .
NCV	Genesis	3	18	The ground will produce thorns and weeds for you , and you will eat the plants of the field .
NCV	Genesis	3	19	You will sweat and work hard for your food . Later you will return to the ground , because you were taken from it . You are dust , and when you die , you will return to the dust. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	20	The man named his wife Eve , [ a ] because she was the mother of all the living .
NCV	Genesis	3	21	The Lord God made clothes from animal skins for the man and his wife and dressed them .
NCV	Genesis	3	22	Then the Lord God said , “ Humans have become like one of us ; they know good and evil . We must keep them from eating some of the fruit from the tree of life , or they will live forever. ”
NCV	Genesis	3	23	So the Lord God forced Adam out of the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken .
NCV	Genesis	3	24	After God forced humans out of the garden , he placed angels and a sword of fire that flashed around in every direction on its eastern border . This kept people from getting to the tree of life . Footnotes - 3:20 Eve This name sounds like the Hebrew word meaning “ alive. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	4	3	Later , Cain brought some food from the ground as a gift to God .
NCV	Genesis	4	5	but he did not accept Cain and his gift . So Cain became very angry and felt rejected .
NCV	Genesis	4	6	The Lord asked Cain , “ Why are you angry ? Why do you look so unhappy ?
NCV	Genesis	4	7	If you do things well , I will accept you , but if you do not do them well , sin is ready to attack you . Sin wants you , but you must rule over it. ”
NCV	Genesis	4	8	Cain said to his brother Abel , “ Let ’ s go out into the field. ” While they were out in the field , Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him .
NCV	Genesis	4	9	Later , the Lord said to Cain , “ Where is your brother Abel ? ” Cain answered , “ I don ’ t know . Is it my job to take care of my brother ? ”
NCV	Genesis	4	10	Then the Lord said , “ What have you done ? Your brother ’ s blood is crying out to me from the ground .
NCV	Genesis	4	11	And now you will be cursed in your work with the ground , the same ground where your brother ’ s blood fell and where your hands killed him .
NCV	Genesis	4	12	You will work the ground , but it will not grow good crops for you anymore , and you will wander around on the earth. ”
NCV	Genesis	4	13	Then Cain said to the Lord , “ This punishment is more than I can stand !
NCV	Genesis	4	14	Today you have forced me to stop working the ground , and now I must hide from you . I must wander around on the earth , and anyone who meets me can kill me. ”
NCV	Genesis	4	15	The Lord said to Cain , “ No ! If anyone kills you , I will punish that person seven times more. ” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain warning anyone who met him not to kill him . Cain ’ s Family

NCV	Genesis	4	20	Adah gave birth to Jabal , who became the first person to live in tents and raise cattle .
NCV	Genesis	4	21	Jabal ’ s brother was Jubal , the first person to play the harp and flute .
NCV	Genesis	4	22	Zillah gave birth to Tubal-Cain , who made tools out of bronze and iron . The sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah .
NCV	Genesis	4	23	Lamech said to his wives : “ Adah and Zillah , hear my voice ! You wives of Lamech , listen to what I say . I killed a man for wounding me , a young man for hitting me .
NCV	Genesis	4	24	If Cain ’ s killer is punished seven times , then Lamech ’ s killer will be punished seventy-seven times. ” Adam and Eve Have a New Son
NCV	Genesis	4	25	Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve again , and she gave birth to a son . She named him Seth [ c ] and said , “ God has given me another child . He will take the place of Abel , who was killed by Cain. ”

NCV	Genesis	7	4	Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth . It will rain forty days and forty nights , and I will wipe off from the earth every living thing that I have made. ”

NCV	Genesis	7	6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came .
NCV	Genesis	7	8	The clean animals , the unclean animals , the birds , and everything that crawls on the ground
NCV	Genesis	7	9	came to Noah . They went into the boat in groups of two , male and female , just as God had commanded Noah .
NCV	Genesis	7	10	Seven days later the flood started .
NCV	Genesis	7	11	When Noah was six hundred years old , the flood started . On the seventeenth day of the second month of that year the underground springs split open , and the clouds in the sky poured out rain .

NCV	Genesis	7	13	On that same day Noah and his wife , his sons Shem , Ham , and Japheth , and their wives went into the boat .
NCV	Genesis	7	14	They had every kind of wild and tame animal , every kind of animal that crawls on the earth , and every kind of bird .
NCV	Genesis	7	15	Every creature that had the breath of life came to Noah in the boat in groups of two .
NCV	Genesis	7	16	One male and one female of every living thing came , just as God had commanded Noah . Then the Lord closed the door behind them .
NCV	Genesis	7	17	Water flooded the earth for forty days , and as it rose it lifted the boat off the ground .
NCV	Genesis	7	18	The water continued to rise , and the boat floated on it above the earth .

NCV	Genesis	7	21	All living things that moved on the earth died . This included all the birds , tame animals , wild animals , and creatures that swarm on the earth , as well as all human beings .
NCV	Genesis	7	22	So everything on dry land that had the breath of life in it died .
NCV	Genesis	7	23	God destroyed from the earth every living thing that was on the land—every man , animal , crawling thing , and bird of the sky . All that was left was Noah and what was with him in the boat .

NCV	Genesis	7	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Genesis	8	8	Then Noah sent out a dove to find out if the water had dried up from the ground .
NCV	Genesis	8	2	The underground springs stopped flowing , and the clouds in the sky stopped pouring down rain . 3-4 The water that covered the earth began to go down . After one hundred fifty days it had gone down so much that the boat touched land again . It came to rest on one of the mountains of Ararat [ a ] on the seventeenth day of the seventh month .
NCV	Genesis	8	5	The water continued to go down so that by the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains could be seen .
NCV	Genesis	8	6	Forty days later Noah opened the window he had made in the boat , and
NCV	Genesis	8	7	he sent out a raven . It flew here and there until the water had dried up from the earth .
NCV	Genesis	8	9	The dove could not find a place to land because water still covered the earth , so it came back to the boat . Noah reached out his hand and took the bird and brought it back into the boat .
NCV	Genesis	8	10	After seven days Noah again sent out the dove from the boat ,
NCV	Genesis	8	11	and that evening it came back to him with a fresh olive leaf in its mouth . Then Noah knew that the ground was almost dry .
NCV	Genesis	8	12	Seven days later he sent the dove out again , but this time it did not come back .
NCV	Genesis	8	13	When Noah was six hundred and one years old , in the first day of the first month of that year , the water was dried up from the land . Noah removed the covering of the boat and saw that the land was dry .
NCV	Genesis	8	14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the land was completely dry .
NCV	Genesis	8	15	Then God said to Noah ,
NCV	Genesis	8	16	“ You and your wife , your sons , and their wives should go out of the boat .
NCV	Genesis	8	17	Bring every animal out of the boat with you—the birds , animals , and everything that crawls on the earth . Let them have many young ones so that they might grow in number. ”
NCV	Genesis	8	18	So Noah went out with his sons , his wife , and his sons ’ wives .
NCV	Genesis	8	19	Every animal , everything that crawls on the earth , and every bird went out of the boat by families .
NCV	Genesis	8	20	Then Noah built an altar to the Lord . He took some of all the clean birds and animals , and he burned them on the altar as offerings to God .
NCV	Genesis	8	21	The Lord was pleased with these sacrifices and said to himself , “ I will never again curse the ground because of human beings . Their thoughts are evil even when they are young , but I will never again destroy every living thing on the earth as I did this time .

NCV	Genesis	9	4	But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it , because blood gives life .

NCV	Genesis	12	5	He took his wife Sarai , his nephew Lot , and everything they owned , as well as all the servants they had gotten in Haran . They set out from Haran , planning to go to the land of Canaan , and in time they arrived there .

NCV	Genesis	12	7	The Lord appeared to Abram and said , “ I will give this land to your descendants. ” So Abram built an altar there to the Lord , who had appeared to him .

NCV	Genesis	13	6	Abram and Lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together ,
NCV	Genesis	13	7	so Abram ’ s herdsmen and Lot ’ s herdsmen began to argue . The Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at this time .
NCV	Genesis	13	8	Abram said to Lot , “ There should be no arguing between you and me , or between your herdsmen and mine , because we are brothers .
NCV	Genesis	13	9	We should separate . The whole land is there in front of you . If you go to the left , I will go to the right . If you go to the right , I will go to the left. ”
NCV	Genesis	13	10	Lot looked all around and saw the whole Jordan Valley and that there was much water there . It was like the Lord ’ s garden , like the land of Egypt in the direction of Zoar . ( This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah . )

NCV	Genesis	13	12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan , but Lot lived among the cities in the Jordan Valley , very near to Sodom .
NCV	Genesis	13	14	After Lot left , the Lord said to Abram , “ Look all around you—to the north and south and east and west .

NCV	Genesis	14	9	They fought against Kedorlaomer king of Elam , Tidal king of Goiim , Amraphel king of Babylonia , and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings fighting against five .
NCV	Genesis	14	10	There were many tar pits in the Valley of Siddim . When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and their armies ran away , some of the soldiers fell into the tar pits , but the others ran away to the mountains .
NCV	Genesis	14	11	Now Kedorlaomer and his armies took everything the people of Sodom and Gomorrah owned , including their food .
NCV	Genesis	14	12	They took Lot , Abram ’ s nephew who was living in Sodom , and everything he owned . Then they left .
NCV	Genesis	14	13	One of the men who was not captured went to Abram , the Hebrew , and told him what had happened . At that time Abram was camped near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite . Mamre was a brother of Eshcol and Aner , and they had all made an agreement to help Abram . Abram Rescues Lot

NCV	Genesis	14	15	That night he divided his men into groups , and they made a surprise attack against the enemy . They chased them all the way to Hobah , north of Damascus .
NCV	Genesis	14	16	Then Abram brought back everything the enemy had stolen , the women and the other people , and Lot , and everything Lot owned .
NCV	Genesis	14	17	After defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him , Abram went home . As he was returning , the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh ( now called King ’ s Valley ) .
NCV	Genesis	14	18	Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine . He was a priest for God Most High
NCV	Genesis	14	19	and blessed Abram , saying , “ Abram , may you be blessed by God Most High , the God who made heaven and earth .
NCV	Genesis	14	20	And we praise God Most High , who has helped you to defeat your enemies. ” Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had brought back from the battle .
NCV	Genesis	14	21	The king of Sodom said to Abram , “ You may keep all these things for yourself . Just give me my people who were captured. ”
NCV	Genesis	14	22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom , “ I make a promise to the Lord , the God Most High , who made heaven and earth .
NCV	Genesis	14	23	I promise that I will not keep anything that is yours . I will not keep even a thread or a sandal strap so that you can not say , ‘ I made Abram rich. ’
NCV	Genesis	14	24	I will keep nothing but the food my young men have eaten . But give Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre their share of what we won , because they went with me into battle. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	15	15	And you , Abram , will die in peace and will be buried at an old age .
NCV	Genesis	15	2	But Abram said , “ Lord God , what can you give me ? I have no son , so my slave Eliezer from Damascus will get everything I own after I die. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	3	Abram said , “ Look , you have given me no son , so a slave born in my house will inherit everything I have. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	4	Then the Lord spoke his word to Abram : “ He will not be the one to inherit what you have . You will have a son of your own who will inherit what you have. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	5	Then God led Abram outside and said , “ Look at the sky . There are so many stars you can not count them . Your descendants also will be too many to count. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	6	Abram believed the Lord . And the Lord accepted Abram ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God .
NCV	Genesis	15	7	God said to Abram , “ I am the Lord who led you out of Ur of Babylonia so that I could give you this land to own. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	8	But Abram said , “ Lord God , how can I be sure that I will own this land ? ”
NCV	Genesis	15	9	The Lord said to Abram , “ Bring me a three-year-old cow , a three-year-old goat , a three-year-old male sheep , a dove , and a young pigeon. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	10	Abram brought them all to God . Then Abram killed the animals and cut each of them into two pieces , laying each half opposite the other half . But he did not cut the birds in half .
NCV	Genesis	15	11	Later , large birds flew down to eat the animals , but Abram chased them away .
NCV	Genesis	15	12	As the sun was going down , Abram fell into a deep sleep . While he was asleep , a very terrible darkness came .
NCV	Genesis	15	13	Then the Lord said to Abram , “ You can be sure that your descendants will be strangers and travel in a land they don ’ t own . The people there will make them slaves and be cruel to them for four hundred years .
NCV	Genesis	15	14	But I will punish the nation where they are slaves . Then your descendants will leave that land , taking great wealth with them .
NCV	Genesis	15	16	After your great-great-grandchildren are born , your people will come to this land again . It will take that long , because I am not yet going to punish the Amorites for their evil behavior. ”
NCV	Genesis	15	17	After the sun went down , it was very dark . Suddenly a smoking firepot and a blazing torch passed between the halves of the dead animals . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	15	18	So on that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram and said , “ I will give to your descendants the land between the river of Egypt and the great river Euphrates .

NCV	Genesis	16	6	But Abram said to Sarai , “ You are Hagar ’ s mistress . Do anything you want to her. ” Then Sarai was hard on Hagar , and Hagar ran away .
NCV	Genesis	16	7	The angel of the Lord found Hagar beside a spring of water in the desert , by the road to Shur .
NCV	Genesis	16	8	The angel said , “ Hagar , Sarai ’ s slave girl , where have you come from ? Where are you going ? ” Hagar answered , “ I am running away from my mistress Sarai. ”
NCV	Genesis	16	9	The angel of the Lord said to her , “ Go home to your mistress and obey her. ”

NCV	Genesis	16	12	Ishmael will be like a wild donkey . He will be against everyone , and everyone will be against him . He will attack all his brothers. ”
NCV	Genesis	16	13	The slave girl gave a name to the Lord who spoke to her : “ You are ‘ God who sees me , ’ ” because she said to herself , “ Have I really seen God who sees me ? ”

NCV	Genesis	18	18	Abraham ’ s children will certainly become a great and powerful nation , and all nations on earth will be blessed through him .
NCV	Genesis	18	2	He looked up and saw three men standing near him . When Abraham saw them , he ran from his tent to meet them . He bowed facedown on the ground before them
NCV	Genesis	18	3	and said , “ Sir , if you think well of me , please stay awhile with me , your servant .
NCV	Genesis	18	4	I will bring some water so all of you can wash your feet . You may rest under the tree ,
NCV	Genesis	18	5	and I will get some bread for you so you can regain your strength . Then you may continue your journey. ” The three men said , “ That is fine . Do as you said. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	6	Abraham hurried to the tent where Sarah was and said to her , “ Hurry , prepare twenty quarts of fine flour , and make it into loaves of bread. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	7	Then Abraham ran to his herd and took one of his best calves . He gave it to a servant , who hurried to kill it and to prepare it for food .
NCV	Genesis	18	8	Abraham gave the three men the calf that had been cooked and milk curds and milk . While they ate , he stood under the tree near them .
NCV	Genesis	18	9	The men asked Abraham , “ Where is your wife Sarah ? ” “ There , in the tent , ” said Abraham .
NCV	Genesis	18	10	Then the Lord said , “ I will certainly return to you about this time a year from now . At that time your wife Sarah will have a son. ” Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent which was behind him .
NCV	Genesis	18	11	Abraham and Sarah were very old . Since Sarah was past the age when women normally have children ,
NCV	Genesis	18	12	she laughed to herself , “ My husband and I are too old to have a baby. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	13	Then the Lord said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh ? Why did she say , ‘ I am too old to have a baby ’ ?
NCV	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too hard for the Lord ? No ! I will return to you at the right time a year from now , and Sarah will have a son. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	15	Sarah was afraid , so she lied and said , “ I didn ’ t laugh. ” But the Lord said , “ No . You did laugh. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	16	Then the men got up to leave and started out toward Sodom . Abraham walked along with them a short time to send them on their way . Abraham ’ s Bargain with God
NCV	Genesis	18	17	The Lord said , “ Should I tell Abraham what I am going to do now ?
NCV	Genesis	18	19	I have chosen him so he would command his children and his descendants to live the way the Lord wants them to , to live right and be fair . Then I , the Lord , will give Abraham what I promised him. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	20	Then the Lord said , “ I have heard many complaints against the people of Sodom and Gomorrah . They are very evil .
NCV	Genesis	18	21	I will go down and see if they are as bad as I have heard . If not , I will know. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	22	So the men turned and went toward Sodom , but Abraham stood there before the Lord .
NCV	Genesis	18	23	Then Abraham approached him and asked , “ Do you plan to destroy the good people along with the evil ones ?
NCV	Genesis	18	24	What if there are fifty good people in that city ? Will you still destroy it ? Surely you will save the city for the fifty good people living there .
NCV	Genesis	18	25	Surely you will not destroy the good people along with the evil ones ; then they would be treated the same . You are the judge of all the earth . Won ’ t you do what is right ? ”
NCV	Genesis	18	26	The Lord said , “ If I find fifty good people in the city of Sodom , I will save the whole city because of them. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	27	Then Abraham said , “ Though I am only dust and ashes , I have been brave to speak to the Lord .
NCV	Genesis	18	28	What if there are only forty-five good people in the city ? Will you destroy the whole city for the lack of five good people ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find forty-five there , I will not destroy the city. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	29	Again Abraham said to him , “ If you find only forty good people there , will you destroy the city ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find forty , I will not destroy it. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	30	Then Abraham said , “ Lord , please don ’ t be angry with me , but let me ask you this . If you find only thirty good people in the city , will you destroy it ? ” He said , “ If I find thirty good people there , I will not destroy the city. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	31	Then Abraham said , “ I have been brave to speak to the Lord . But what if there are twenty good people in the city ? ” He answered , “ If I find twenty there , I will not destroy the city. ”
NCV	Genesis	18	32	Then Abraham said , “ Lord , please don ’ t be angry with me , but let me bother you this one last time . What if you find ten there ? ” He said , “ If I find ten there , I will not destroy it. ”

NCV	Genesis	19	19	You have been merciful and kind to me and have saved my life . But I can ’ t run to the mountains . The disaster will catch me , and I will die .
NCV	Genesis	19	2	Lot said , “ Sirs , please come to my house and spend the night . There you can wash your feet , and then tomorrow you may continue your journey. ” The angels answered , “ No , we will spend the night in the city ’ s public square. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	3	But Lot begged them to come , so they agreed and went to his house . Then Lot prepared a meal for them . He baked bread without yeast , and they ate it .
NCV	Genesis	19	4	Before bedtime , men both young and old and from every part of Sodom surrounded Lot ’ s house .
NCV	Genesis	19	5	They called to Lot , “ Where are the two men who came to you tonight ? Bring them out to us so we can have sexual relations with them. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	6	Lot went outside to them , closing the door behind him .
NCV	Genesis	19	7	He said , “ No , my brothers ! Do not do this evil thing .
NCV	Genesis	19	8	Look ! I have two daughters who have never slept with a man . I will give them to you , and you may do anything you want with them . But please don ’ t do anything to these men . They have come to my house , and I must protect them. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	9	The men around the house answered , “ Move out of the way ! ” Then they said to each other , “ This man Lot came to our city as a stranger , and now he wants to tell us what to do ! ” They said to Lot , “ We will do worse things to you than to them. ” They started pushing him back and were ready to break down the door .
NCV	Genesis	19	10	But the two men staying with Lot opened the door , pulled him back inside the house , and then closed the door .
NCV	Genesis	19	11	They struck those outside the door with blindness , so the men , both young and old , could not find the door .
NCV	Genesis	19	12	The two men said to Lot , “ Do you have any other relatives in this city ? Do you have any sons-in-law , sons , daughters , or any other relatives ? If you do , tell them to leave now ,
NCV	Genesis	19	13	because we are about to destroy this city . The Lord has heard of all the evil that is here , so he has sent us to destroy it. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	14	So Lot went out and said to his future sons-in-law who were pledged to marry his daughters , “ Hurry and leave this city ! The Lord is about to destroy it ! ” But they thought Lot was joking .
NCV	Genesis	19	15	At dawn the next morning , the angels begged Lot to hurry . They said , “ Go ! Take your wife and your two daughters with you so you will not be destroyed when the city is punished. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	16	But Lot delayed . So the two men took the hands of Lot , his wife , and his two daughters and led them safely out of the city . So the Lord was merciful to Lot and his family .
NCV	Genesis	19	17	After they brought them out of the city , one of the men said , “ Run for your lives ! Don ’ t look back or stop anywhere in the valley . Run to the mountains , or you will be destroyed. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	18	But Lot said to one of them , “ Sir , please don ’ t force me to go so far !
NCV	Genesis	19	20	Look , that little town over there is not too far away . Let me run there . It ’ s really just a little town , and I ’ ll be safe there. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	21	The angel said to Lot , “ Very well , I will allow you to do this also . I will not destroy that town .
NCV	Genesis	19	22	But run there fast , because I can not destroy Sodom until you are safely in that town. ” ( That town is named Zoar , [ a ] because it is little . ) Sodom and Gomorrah Are Destroyed
NCV	Genesis	19	23	The sun had already come up when Lot entered Zoar .
NCV	Genesis	19	24	The Lord sent a rain of burning sulfur down from the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah
NCV	Genesis	19	25	and destroyed those cities . He also destroyed the whole Jordan Valley , everyone living in the cities , and even all the plants .
NCV	Genesis	19	26	At that point Lot ’ s wife looked back . When she did , she became a pillar of salt .
NCV	Genesis	19	27	Early the next morning , Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood before the Lord .
NCV	Genesis	19	28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the Jordan Valley and saw smoke rising from the land , like smoke from a furnace .
NCV	Genesis	19	29	God destroyed the cities in the valley , but he remembered what Abraham had asked . So God saved Lot ’ s life , but he destroyed the city where Lot had lived . Lot and His Daughters
NCV	Genesis	19	30	Lot was afraid to continue living in Zoar , so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave .
NCV	Genesis	19	31	One day the older daughter said to the younger , “ Our father is old . Everywhere on the earth women and men marry , but there are no men around here for us to marry .
NCV	Genesis	19	32	Let ’ s get our father drunk and have sexual relations with him . We can use him to have children and continue our family. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	33	That night the two girls got their father drunk , and the older daughter went and had sexual relations with him . But Lot did not know when she lay down or when she got up .
NCV	Genesis	19	34	The next day the older daughter said to the younger , “ Last night I had sexual relations with my father . Let ’ s get him drunk again tonight so you can go and have sexual relations with him , too . In this way we can use our father to have children to continue our family. ”
NCV	Genesis	19	35	So that night they got their father drunk again , and the younger daughter went and had sexual relations with him . Again , Lot did not know when she lay down or when she got up .
NCV	Genesis	19	36	So both of Lot ’ s daughters became pregnant by their father .
NCV	Genesis	19	37	The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab . He is the ancestor of all the Moabite people who are still living today .
NCV	Genesis	19	38	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi . He is the father of all the Ammonite people who are still living today . Footnotes - 19:22 Zoar This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “ little. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	20	20	Abraham left Hebron and traveled to southern Canaan where he stayed awhile between Kadesh and Shur . When he moved to Gerar ,
NCV	Genesis	20	2	he told people that his wife Sarah was his sister . Abimelech king of Gerar heard this , so he sent some servants to take her .
NCV	Genesis	20	3	But one night God spoke to Abimelech in a dream and said , “ You will die . The woman you took is married. ”
NCV	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelech had not gone near Sarah , so he said , “ Lord , would you destroy an innocent nation ?
NCV	Genesis	20	5	Abraham himself told me , ‘ This woman is my sister , ’ and she also said , ‘ He is my brother. ’ I am innocent . I did not know I was doing anything wrong. ”
NCV	Genesis	20	6	Then God said to Abimelech in the dream , “ Yes , I know you did not realize what you were doing . So I did not allow you to sin against me and touch her .
NCV	Genesis	20	7	Give Abraham his wife back . He is a prophet . He will pray for you , and you will not die . But if you do not give Sarah back , you and all your family will surely die. ”
NCV	Genesis	20	8	So early the next morning , Abimelech called all his officers and told them everything that had happened in the dream . They were very afraid .
NCV	Genesis	20	9	Then Abimelech called Abraham to him and said , “ What have you done to us ? What wrong did I do against you ? Why did you bring this trouble to my kingdom ? You should not have done these things to me .
NCV	Genesis	20	10	What were you thinking that caused you to do this ? ”
NCV	Genesis	20	11	Then Abraham answered , “ I thought no one in this place respected God and that someone would kill me to get Sarah .
NCV	Genesis	20	12	And it is true that she is my sister . She is the daughter of my father , but she is not the daughter of my mother .
NCV	Genesis	20	13	When God told me to leave my father ’ s house and wander in many different places , I told Sarah , ‘ You must do a special favor for me . Everywhere we go tell people I am your brother. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	20	14	Then Abimelech gave Abraham some sheep , cattle , and male and female slaves . He also gave Sarah , Abraham ’ s wife , back to him
NCV	Genesis	20	15	and said , “ Look around you at my land . You may live anywhere you want. ”
NCV	Genesis	20	16	Abimelech said to Sarah , “ I gave your brother Abraham twenty-five pounds of silver to make up for any wrong that people may think about you . I want everyone to know that you are innocent. ”

NCV	Genesis	21	2	Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age . Everything happened at the time God had said it would .
NCV	Genesis	21	3	Abraham named his son Isaac , the son Sarah gave birth to .
NCV	Genesis	21	4	He circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old as God had commanded .
NCV	Genesis	21	5	Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born .
NCV	Genesis	21	6	And Sarah said , “ God has made me laugh . [ a ] Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me .
NCV	Genesis	21	7	No one thought that I would be able to have Abraham ’ s child , but even though Abraham is old I have given him a son. ” Hagar and Ishmael Leave
NCV	Genesis	21	8	Isaac grew , and when he became old enough to eat food , Abraham gave a great feast .
NCV	Genesis	21	9	But Sarah saw Ishmael making fun of Isaac . ( Ishmael was the son of Abraham by Hagar , Sarah ’ s Egyptian slave . )
NCV	Genesis	21	10	So Sarah said to Abraham , “ Throw out this slave woman and her son . Her son should not inherit anything ; my son Isaac should receive it all. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	11	This troubled Abraham very much because Ishmael was also his son .
NCV	Genesis	21	12	But God said to Abraham , “ Don ’ t be troubled about the boy and the slave woman . Do whatever Sarah tells you . The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac .
NCV	Genesis	21	13	I will also make the descendants of Ishmael into a great nation because he is your son , too. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	14	Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a leather bag full of water . He gave them to Hagar and sent her away . Carrying these things and her son , Hagar went and wandered in the desert of Beersheba .
NCV	Genesis	21	15	Later , when all the water was gone from the bag , Hagar put her son under a bush .
NCV	Genesis	21	16	Then she went away a short distance and sat down . She thought , “ My son will die , and I can not watch this happen. ” She sat there and began to cry .
NCV	Genesis	21	17	God heard the boy crying , and God ’ s angel called to Hagar from heaven . He said , “ What is wrong , Hagar ? Don ’ t be afraid ! God has heard the boy crying there .
NCV	Genesis	21	18	Help him up and take him by the hand . I will make his descendants into a great nation. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	19	Then God showed Hagar a well of water . So she went to the well and filled her bag with water and gave the boy a drink .
NCV	Genesis	21	20	God was with the boy as he grew up . Ishmael lived in the desert and became an archer .
NCV	Genesis	21	22	Then Abimelech came with Phicol , the commander of his army , and said to Abraham , “ God is with you in everything you do .
NCV	Genesis	21	23	So make a promise to me here before God that you will be fair with me and my children and my descendants . Be kind to me and to this land where you have lived as a stranger—as kind as I have been to you. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said , “ I promise. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about Abimelech ’ s servants who had seized a well of water .
NCV	Genesis	21	26	But Abimelech said , “ I don ’ t know who did this . You never told me about this before today. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	27	Then Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle , and they made an agreement .
NCV	Genesis	21	28	Abraham also put seven female lambs in front of Abimelech .
NCV	Genesis	21	29	Abimelech asked Abraham , “ Why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves ? ”
NCV	Genesis	21	30	Abraham answered , “ Accept these lambs from me to prove that you believe I dug this well. ”
NCV	Genesis	21	31	So that place was called Beersheba [ b ] because they made a promise to each other there .

NCV	Genesis	22	3	Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey . He took Isaac and two servants with him . After he cut the wood for the sacrifice , they went to the place God had told them to go .
NCV	Genesis	22	4	On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance .
NCV	Genesis	22	5	He said to his servants , “ Stay here with the donkey . My son and I will go over there and worship , and then we will come back to you. ”
NCV	Genesis	22	6	Abraham took the wood for the sacrifice and gave it to his son to carry , but he himself took the knife and the fire . So he and his son went on together .
NCV	Genesis	22	7	Isaac said to his father Abraham , “ Father ! ” Abraham answered , “ Yes , my son. ” Isaac said , “ We have the fire and the wood , but where is the lamb we will burn as a sacrifice ? ”
NCV	Genesis	22	8	Abraham answered , “ God will give us the lamb for the sacrifice , my son. ” So Abraham and his son went on together
NCV	Genesis	22	9	and came to the place God had told him about . Abraham built an altar there . He laid the wood on it and then tied up his son Isaac and laid him on the wood on the altar .
NCV	Genesis	22	10	Then Abraham took his knife and was about to kill his son .
NCV	Genesis	22	11	But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said , “ Abraham ! Abraham ! ” Abraham answered , “ Yes. ”
NCV	Genesis	22	12	The angel said , “ Don ’ t kill your son or hurt him in any way . Now I can see that you trust God and that you have not kept your son , your only son , from me. ”
NCV	Genesis	22	13	Then Abraham looked up and saw a male sheep caught in a bush by its horns . So Abraham went and took the sheep and killed it . He offered it as a whole burnt offering to God , and his son was saved .
NCV	Genesis	22	14	So Abraham named that place The Lord Provides . Even today people say , “ On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided. ”
NCV	Genesis	22	15	The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time
NCV	Genesis	22	16	and said , “ The Lord says , ‘ Because you did not keep back your son , your only son , from me , I make you this promise by my own name :

NCV	Genesis	22	19	Then Abraham returned to his servants . They all traveled back to Beersheba , and Abraham stayed there .
NCV	Genesis	22	20	After these things happened , someone told Abraham : “ Your brother Nahor and his wife Milcah have children now .

NCV	Genesis	23	23	Sarah lived to be one hundred twenty-seven years old .
NCV	Genesis	23	2	She died in Kiriath Arba ( that is , Hebron ) in the land of Canaan . Abraham was very sad and cried because of her .
NCV	Genesis	23	3	After a while he got up from the side of his wife ’ s body and went to talk to the Hittites . He said ,
NCV	Genesis	23	4	“ I am only a stranger and a foreigner here . Sell me some of your land so that I can bury my dead wife. ”
NCV	Genesis	23	5	The Hittites answered Abraham ,
NCV	Genesis	23	6	“ Sir , you are a great leader among us . You may have the best place we have to bury your dead . You may have any of our burying places that you want , and none of us will stop you from burying your dead wife. ”
NCV	Genesis	23	7	Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land , the Hittites .
NCV	Genesis	23	8	He said to them , “ If you truly want to help me bury my dead wife here , speak to Ephron , the son of Zohar for me .
NCV	Genesis	23	9	Ask him to sell me the cave of Machpelah at the edge of his field . I will pay him the full price . You can be the witnesses that I am buying it as a burial place. ”
NCV	Genesis	23	10	Ephron was sitting among the Hittites at the city gate . He answered Abraham ,
NCV	Genesis	23	11	“ No , sir . I will give you the land and the cave that is in it , with these people as witnesses . Bury your dead wife. ”
NCV	Genesis	23	12	Then Abraham bowed down before the Hittites .
NCV	Genesis	23	13	He said to Ephron before all the people , “ Please let me pay you the full price for the field . Accept my money , and I will bury my dead there. ”
NCV	Genesis	23	14	Ephron answered Abraham ,
NCV	Genesis	23	15	“ Sir , the land is worth ten pounds of silver , but I won ’ t argue with you over the price . Take the land , and bury your dead wife. ”
NCV	Genesis	23	16	Abraham agreed and paid Ephron in front of the Hittite witnesses . He weighed out the full price , ten pounds of silver , and they counted the weight as the traders normally did . 17-18 So Ephron ’ s field in Machpelah , east of Mamre , was sold . Abraham became the owner of the field , the cave in it , and all the trees that were in the field . The sale was made at the city gate , with the Hittites as witnesses .
NCV	Genesis	23	19	After this , Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah , near Mamre . ( Mamre was later called Hebron in the land of Canaan . )

NCV	Genesis	24	7	The Lord , the God of heaven , brought me from the home of my father and the land of my relatives . And he promised me , ‘ I will give this land to your descendants. ’ The Lord will send his angel before you to help you get a wife for my son there .
NCV	Genesis	24	8	If the girl won ’ t come back with you , you will be free from this promise . But you must not take my son back there. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	9	So the servant put his hand under his master ’ s leg and made a promise to Abraham about this .
NCV	Genesis	24	10	The servant took ten of Abraham ’ s camels and left , carrying with him many different kinds of beautiful gifts . He went to Northwest Mesopotamia to Nahor ’ s city .
NCV	Genesis	24	11	In the evening , when the women come out to get water , he made the camels kneel down at the well outside the city .
NCV	Genesis	24	12	The servant said , “ Lord , God of my master Abraham , allow me to find a wife for his son today . Please show this kindness to my master Abraham .
NCV	Genesis	24	13	Here I am , standing by the spring , and the girls from the city are coming out to get water .
NCV	Genesis	24	14	I will say to one of them , ‘ Please put your jar down so I can drink. ’ Then let her say , ‘ Drink , and I will also give water to your camels. ’ If that happens , I will know she is the right one for your servant Isaac and that you have shown kindness to my master. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	15	Before the servant had finished praying , Rebekah , the daughter of Bethuel , came out of the city . ( Bethuel was the son of Milcah and Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother . ) Rebekah was carrying her water jar on her shoulder .
NCV	Genesis	24	16	She was very pretty , a virgin ; she had never had sexual relations with a man . She went down to the spring and filled her jar , then came back up .
NCV	Genesis	24	17	The servant ran to her and said , “ Please give me a little water from your jar. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	18	Rebekah said , “ Drink , sir. ” She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and gave him a drink .
NCV	Genesis	24	19	After he finished drinking , Rebekah said , “ I will also pour some water for your camels. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	20	So she quickly poured all the water from her jar into the drinking trough for the camels . Then she kept running to the well until she had given all the camels enough to drink .
NCV	Genesis	24	21	The servant quietly watched her . He wanted to be sure the Lord had made his trip successful .
NCV	Genesis	24	22	After the camels had finished drinking , he gave Rebekah a gold ring weighing one-fifth of an ounce and two gold arm bracelets weighing about four ounces each .
NCV	Genesis	24	23	He asked , “ Who is your father ? Is there a place in his house for me and my men to spend the night ? ”
NCV	Genesis	24	25	Then she said , “ And , yes , we have straw for your camels and a place for you to spend the night. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	26	The servant bowed and worshiped the Lord
NCV	Genesis	24	27	and said , “ Blessed is the Lord , the God of my master Abraham . The Lord has been kind and truthful to him and has led me to my master ’ s relatives. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	28	Then Rebekah ran and told her mother ’ s family about all these things .
NCV	Genesis	24	29	She had a brother named Laban , who ran out to Abraham ’ s servant , who was still at the spring .
NCV	Genesis	24	30	Laban had heard what she had said and had seen the ring and the bracelets on his sister ’ s arms . So he ran out to the well , and there was the man standing by the camels at the spring .
NCV	Genesis	24	31	Laban said , “ Sir , you are welcome to come in ; you don ’ t have to stand outside . I have prepared the house for you and also a place for your camels. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	32	So Abraham ’ s servant went into the house . After Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and food , he gave water to Abraham ’ s servant so he and the men with him could wash their feet .
NCV	Genesis	24	33	Then Laban gave the servant food , but the servant said , “ I will not eat until I have told you why I came. ” So Laban said , “ Then tell us. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	34	He said , “ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
NCV	Genesis	24	35	The Lord has greatly blessed my master in everything , and he has become a rich man . The Lord has given him many flocks of sheep , herds of cattle , silver and gold , male and female servants , camels , and horses .
NCV	Genesis	24	36	Sarah , my master ’ s wife , gave birth to a son when she was old , and my master has given everything he owns to that son .
NCV	Genesis	24	37	My master had me make a promise to him and said , ‘ Don ’ t get a wife for my son from the Canaanite girls who live around here .
NCV	Genesis	24	38	Instead , you must go to my father ’ s people and to my family . There you must get a wife for my son. ’
NCV	Genesis	24	39	I said to my master , ‘ What if the woman will not come back with me ? ’
NCV	Genesis	24	40	But he said , ‘ I serve the Lord , who will send his angel with you and will help you . You will get a wife for my son from my family and my father ’ s people .
NCV	Genesis	24	41	Then you will be free from the promise . But if they will not give you a wife for my son , you will be free from this promise. ’
NCV	Genesis	24	42	“ Today I came to this spring . I said , ‘ Lord , God of my master Abraham , please make my trip successful .
NCV	Genesis	24	43	I am standing by this spring . I will wait for a young woman to come out to get water , and I will say , “ Please give me water from your jar to drink. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	44	Then let her say , “ Drink this water , and I will also get water for your camels. ” By this I will know the Lord has chosen her for my master ’ s son. ’
NCV	Genesis	24	45	“ Before I finished my silent prayer , Rebekah came out of the city with her water jar on her shoulder . She went down to the spring and got water . I said to her , ‘ Please give me a drink. ’
NCV	Genesis	24	46	She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said , ‘ Drink this . I will also get water for your camels. ’ So I drank , and she gave water to my camels too .
NCV	Genesis	24	47	When I asked her , ‘ Who is your father ? ’ she answered , ‘ My father is Bethuel son of Milcah and Nahor. ’ Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms ,
NCV	Genesis	24	48	and I bowed my head and thanked the Lord . I praised the Lord , the God of my master Abraham , because he led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master ’ s brother for his son .
NCV	Genesis	24	49	Now , tell me , will you be kind and truthful to my master ? And if not , tell me so . Then I will know what I should do. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	50	Laban and Bethuel answered , “ This is clearly from the Lord , and we can not change what must happen .
NCV	Genesis	24	51	Rebekah is yours . Take her and go . Let her marry your master ’ s son as the Lord has commanded. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	52	When Abraham ’ s servant heard these words , he bowed facedown on the ground before the Lord .
NCV	Genesis	24	53	Then he gave Rebekah gold and silver jewelry and clothes . He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and mother .
NCV	Genesis	24	54	The servant and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there . When they got up the next morning , the servant said , “ Now let me go back to my master. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	55	Rebekah ’ s mother and her brother said , “ Let Rebekah stay with us at least ten days . After that she may go. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	56	But the servant said to them , “ Do not make me wait , because the Lord has made my trip successful . Now let me go back to my master. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	57	Rebekah ’ s brother and mother said , “ We will call Rebekah and ask her what she wants to do. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	58	They called her and asked her , “ Do you want to go with this man now ? ” She said , “ Yes , I do. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	59	So they allowed Rebekah and her nurse to go with Abraham ’ s servant and his men .
NCV	Genesis	24	60	They blessed Rebekah and said , “ Our sister , may you be the mother of thousands of people , and may your descendants capture the cities of their enemies. ”
NCV	Genesis	24	61	Then Rebekah and her servant girls got on the camels and followed the servant and his men . So the servant took Rebekah and left .
NCV	Genesis	24	62	At this time Isaac had left Beer Lahai Roi and was living in southern Canaan .
NCV	Genesis	24	63	One evening when he went out to the field to think , he looked up and saw camels coming .
NCV	Genesis	24	64	Rebekah also looked and saw Isaac . Then she jumped down from the camel
NCV	Genesis	24	65	and asked the servant , “ Who is that man walking in the field to meet us ? ” The servant answered , “ That is my master. ” So Rebekah covered her face with her veil .
NCV	Genesis	24	66	The servant told Isaac everything that had happened .
NCV	Genesis	24	67	Then Isaac brought Rebekah into the tent of Sarah , his mother , and she became his wife . Isaac loved her very much , and so he was comforted after his mother ’ s death .

NCV	Genesis	25	25	The first baby was born red . Since his skin was like a hairy robe , he was named Esau . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	25	2	She gave birth to Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak , and Shuah .
NCV	Genesis	25	3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan . Dedan ’ s descendants were the people of Assyria , Letush , and Leum .
NCV	Genesis	25	4	The sons of Midian were Ephah , Epher , Hanoch , Abida , and Eldaah . All these were descendants of Keturah .
NCV	Genesis	25	5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac .
NCV	Genesis	25	6	But before Abraham died , he did give gifts to the sons of his other wives , then sent them to the East to be away from Isaac .
NCV	Genesis	25	7	Abraham lived to be one hundred seventy-five years old .
NCV	Genesis	25	8	He breathed his last breath and died at an old age , after a long and satisfying life .
NCV	Genesis	25	9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron east of Mamre . ( Ephron was the son of Zohar the Hittite . )
NCV	Genesis	25	10	So Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah in the same field that he had bought from the Hittites .
NCV	Genesis	25	11	After Abraham died , God blessed his son Isaac . Isaac was now living at Beer Lahai Roi .
NCV	Genesis	25	12	This is the family history of Ishmael , Abraham ’ s son . ( Hagar , Sarah ’ s Egyptian servant , was Ishmael ’ s mother . )
NCV	Genesis	25	13	These are the names of Ishmael ’ s sons in the order they were born : Nebaioth , the first son , then Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
NCV	Genesis	25	14	Mishma , Dumah , Massa ,
NCV	Genesis	25	15	Hadad , Tema , Jetur , Naphish , and Kedemah .
NCV	Genesis	25	16	These were Ishmael ’ s sons , and these are the names of the tribal leaders listed according to their settlements and camps .
NCV	Genesis	25	17	Ishmael lived one hundred thirty-seven years and then breathed his last breath and died .
NCV	Genesis	25	18	His descendants lived from Havilah to Shur , which is east of Egypt stretching toward Assyria . They often attacked the descendants of his brothers . Isaac ’ s Family
NCV	Genesis	25	19	This is the family history of Isaac . Abraham had a son named Isaac .
NCV	Genesis	25	20	When Isaac was forty years old , he married Rebekah , who came from Northwest Mesopotamia . She was Bethuel ’ s daughter and the sister of Laban the Aramean .
NCV	Genesis	25	21	Isaac ’ s wife could not have children , so Isaac prayed to the Lord for her . The Lord heard Isaac ’ s prayer , and Rebekah became pregnant .
NCV	Genesis	25	22	While she was pregnant , the babies struggled inside her . She asked , “ Why is this happening to me ? ” Then she went to get an answer from the Lord .
NCV	Genesis	25	23	The Lord said to her , “ Two nations are in your body , and two groups of people will be taken from you . One group will be stronger than the other , and the older will serve the younger. ”
NCV	Genesis	25	24	When the time came , Rebekah gave birth to twins .
NCV	Genesis	25	26	When the second baby was born , he was holding on to Esau ’ s heel , so that baby was named Jacob . [ b ] Isaac was sixty years old when they were born .
NCV	Genesis	25	27	When the boys grew up , Esau became a skilled hunter . He loved to be out in the fields . But Jacob was a quiet man and stayed among the tents .
NCV	Genesis	25	28	Isaac loved Esau because he hunted the wild animals that Isaac enjoyed eating . But Rebekah loved Jacob .
NCV	Genesis	25	29	One day Jacob was boiling a pot of vegetable soup . Esau came in from hunting in the fields , weak from hunger .
NCV	Genesis	25	30	So Esau said to Jacob , “ Let me eat some of that red soup , because I am weak with hunger. ” ( That is why people call him Edom . [ c ] )
NCV	Genesis	25	31	But Jacob said , “ You must sell me your rights as the firstborn son. ” [ d ]
NCV	Genesis	25	32	Esau said , “ I am almost dead from hunger . If I die , all of my father ’ s wealth will not help me. ”
NCV	Genesis	25	33	But Jacob said , “ First , promise me that you will give it to me. ” So Esau made a promise to Jacob and sold his part of their father ’ s wealth to Jacob .
NCV	Genesis	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and vegetable soup , and he ate and drank , and then left . So Esau showed how little he cared about his rights as the firstborn son .

NCV	Genesis	26	26	Abimelech came from Gerar to see Isaac . He brought with him Ahuzzath , who advised him , and Phicol , the commander of his army .
NCV	Genesis	26	2	The Lord appeared to Isaac and said , “ Don ’ t go down to Egypt , but live in the land where I tell you to live .
NCV	Genesis	26	3	Stay in this land , and I will be with you and bless you . I will give you and your descendants all these lands , and I will keep the oath I made to Abraham your father .
NCV	Genesis	26	4	I will give you many descendants , as hard to count as the stars in the sky , and I will give them all these lands . Through your descendants all the nations on the earth will be blessed .
NCV	Genesis	26	5	I will do this because your father Abraham obeyed me . He did what I said and obeyed my commands , my teachings , and my rules. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar .
NCV	Genesis	26	7	His wife Rebekah was very beautiful , and the men of that place asked Isaac about her . Isaac said , “ She is my sister , ” because he was afraid to tell them she was his wife . He thought they might kill him so they could have her .
NCV	Genesis	26	8	Isaac lived there a long time . One day as Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out his window , he saw Isaac holding his wife Rebekah tenderly .
NCV	Genesis	26	9	Abimelech called for Isaac and said , “ This woman is your wife . Why did you say she was your sister ? ” Isaac said to him , “ I was afraid you would kill me so you could have her. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	10	Abimelech said , “ What have you done to us ? One of our men might have had sexual relations with your wife . Then we would have been guilty of a great sin. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	11	So Abimelech warned everyone , “ Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death. ” Isaac Becomes Rich
NCV	Genesis	26	12	Isaac planted seed in that land , and that year he gathered a great harvest . The Lord blessed him very much ,
NCV	Genesis	26	13	and he became rich . He gathered more wealth until he became a very rich man .
NCV	Genesis	26	14	He had so many slaves and flocks and herds that the Philistines envied him .
NCV	Genesis	26	15	So they stopped up all the wells the servants of Isaac ’ s father Abraham had dug . ( They had dug them when Abraham was alive . ) The Philistines filled those wells with dirt .
NCV	Genesis	26	16	And Abimelech said to Isaac , “ Leave our country because you have become much more powerful than we are. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac left that place and camped in the Valley of Gerar and lived there .
NCV	Genesis	26	18	Long before this time Abraham had dug many wells , but after he died , the Philistines filled them with dirt . So Isaac dug those wells again and gave them the same names his father had given them .
NCV	Genesis	26	19	Isaac ’ s servants dug a well in the valley , from which a spring of water flowed .
NCV	Genesis	26	20	But the herdsmen of Gerar argued with them and said , “ This water is ours. ” So Isaac named that well Argue because they argued with him .
NCV	Genesis	26	21	Then his servants dug another well . When the people also argued about it , Isaac named that well Fight .
NCV	Genesis	26	22	He moved from there and dug another well . No one argued about this one , so he named it Room Enough . Isaac said , “ Now the Lord has made room for us , and we will be successful in this land. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	23	From there Isaac went to Beersheba .
NCV	Genesis	26	24	The Lord appeared to him that night and said , “ I am the God of your father Abraham . Don ’ t be afraid , because I am with you . I will bless you and give you many descendants because of my servant Abraham. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	25	So Isaac built an altar and worshiped the Lord there . He also made a camp there , and his servants dug a well .
NCV	Genesis	26	27	Isaac asked them , “ Why have you come to see me ? You were my enemy and forced me to leave your country. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	28	They answered , “ Now we know that the Lord is with you . Let us swear an oath to each other . Let us make an agreement with you
NCV	Genesis	26	29	that since we did not hurt you , you will not hurt us . We were good to you and sent you away in peace . Now the Lord has blessed you. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	30	So Isaac prepared food for them , and they all ate and drank .
NCV	Genesis	26	31	Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other . Then Isaac sent them away , and they left in peace .
NCV	Genesis	26	32	That day Isaac ’ s servants came and told him about the well they had dug , saying , “ We found water in that well. ”
NCV	Genesis	26	33	So Isaac named it Shibah [ a ] and that city is called Beersheba even now .
NCV	Genesis	26	34	When Esau was forty years old , he married two Hittite women—Judith daughter of Beeri and Basemath daughter of Elon .
NCV	Genesis	26	35	These women brought much sorrow to Isaac and Rebekah . Footnotes - 26:33 Shibah This name sounds like the Hebrew words for “ seven ” and “ promise. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	27	27	So Jacob went to his father and kissed him . When Isaac smelled Esau ’ s clothes , he blessed him and said , “ The smell of my son is like the smell of the field that the Lord has blessed .
NCV	Genesis	27	2	Isaac said , “ I am old and don ’ t know when I might die .
NCV	Genesis	27	3	So take your bow and arrows and go hunting in the field for an animal for me to eat .
NCV	Genesis	27	4	When you prepare the tasty food that I love , bring it to me , and I will eat . Then I will bless you before I die. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	5	So Esau went out in the field to hunt . Rebekah was listening as Isaac said this to his son Esau .
NCV	Genesis	27	6	She said to her son Jacob , “ Listen , I heard your father saying to your brother Esau ,
NCV	Genesis	27	7	‘ Kill an animal and prepare some tasty food for me to eat . Then I will bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die. ’
NCV	Genesis	27	8	So obey me , my son , and do what I tell you .
NCV	Genesis	27	9	Go out to our goats and bring me two of the best young ones . I will prepare them just the way your father likes them .
NCV	Genesis	27	10	Then you will take the food to your father , and he will bless you before he dies. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	11	But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah , “ My brother Esau is a hairy man , and I am smooth !
NCV	Genesis	27	12	If my father touches me , he will know I am not Esau . Then he will not bless me but will place a curse on me because I tried to trick him. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	13	So Rebekah said to him , “ If your father puts a curse on you , I will accept the blame . Just do what I said . Go get the goats for me. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	14	So Jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother , and she cooked them in the special way Isaac enjoyed .
NCV	Genesis	27	15	She took the best clothes of her older son Esau that were in the house and put them on the younger son Jacob .
NCV	Genesis	27	16	She also took the skins of the goats and put them on Jacob ’ s hands and neck .
NCV	Genesis	27	17	Then she gave Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made .
NCV	Genesis	27	18	Jacob went in to his father and said , “ Father. ” And his father said , “ Yes , my son . Who are you ? ”
NCV	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to him , “ I am Esau , your first son . I have done what you told me . Now sit up and eat some meat of the animal I hunted for you . Then bless me. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	20	But Isaac asked his son , “ How did you find and kill the animal so quickly ? ” Jacob answered , “ Because the Lord your God helped me to find it. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Come near so I can touch you , my son . Then I will know if you are really my son Esau. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	22	So Jacob came near to Isaac his father . Isaac touched him and said , “ Your voice sounds like Jacob ’ s voice , but your hands are hairy like the hands of Esau. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	23	Isaac did not know it was Jacob , because his hands were hairy like Esau ’ s hands , so Isaac blessed him .
NCV	Genesis	27	24	Isaac asked , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” Jacob answered , “ Yes , I am. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	25	Then Isaac said , “ Bring me the food , and I will eat it and bless you. ” So Jacob gave him the food , and he ate . Jacob gave him wine , and he drank .
NCV	Genesis	27	26	Then Isaac said to him , “ My son , come near and kiss me. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	28	May God give you plenty of rain and good soil so that you will have plenty of grain and new wine .
NCV	Genesis	27	29	May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you . May you be master over your brothers , and may your mother ’ s sons bow down to you . May everyone who curses you be cursed , and may everyone who blesses you be blessed. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	30	Isaac finished blessing Jacob . Then , just as Jacob left his father Isaac , Esau came in from hunting .
NCV	Genesis	27	31	He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father . He said , “ Father , rise and eat the food that your son killed for you and then bless me. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	32	Isaac asked , “ Who are you ? ” He answered , “ I am your son—your firstborn son—Esau. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	33	Then Isaac trembled greatly and said , “ Then who was it that hunted the animals and brought me food before you came ? I ate it , and I blessed him , and it is too late now to take back my blessing. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard the words of his father , he let out a loud and bitter cry . He said to his father , “ Bless me—me , too , my father ! ”
NCV	Genesis	27	35	But Isaac said , “ Your brother came and tricked me . He has taken your blessing. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	36	Esau said , “ Jacob [ a ] is the right name for him . He has tricked me these two times . He took away my share of everything you own , and now he has taken away my blessing. ” Then Esau asked , “ Haven ’ t you saved a blessing for me ? ”
NCV	Genesis	27	37	Isaac answered , “ I gave Jacob the power to be master over you , and all his brothers will be his servants . And I kept him strong with grain and new wine . There is nothing left to give you , my son. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	38	But Esau continued , “ Do you have only one blessing , Father ? Bless me , too , Father ! ” Then Esau began to cry out loud .
NCV	Genesis	27	39	Isaac said to him , “ You will live far away from the best land , far from the rain .
NCV	Genesis	27	40	You will live by using your sword , and you will be a slave to your brother . But when you struggle , you will break free from him. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	41	After that Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing from Isaac . He thought to himself , “ My father will soon die , and I will be sad for him . Then I will kill Jacob. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	42	Rebekah heard about Esau ’ s plan to kill Jacob . So she sent for Jacob and said to him , “ Listen , your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you .
NCV	Genesis	27	43	So , my son , do what I say . My brother Laban is living in Haran . Go to him at once !
NCV	Genesis	27	44	Stay with him for a while , until your brother is not so angry .
NCV	Genesis	27	45	In time , your brother will not be angry , and he will forget what you did to him . Then I will send a servant to bring you back . I don ’ t want to lose both of my sons on the same day. ”
NCV	Genesis	27	46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac , “ I am tired of Hittite women . If Jacob marries one of these Hittite women here in this land , I want to die. ” Footnotes - 27:36 Jacob This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “ heel. ” “ Grabbing someone ’ s heel ” is a Hebrew saying for tricking someone .

NCV	Genesis	28	28	Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him , “ You must not marry a Canaanite woman .
NCV	Genesis	28	2	Go to the house of Bethuel , your mother ’ s father , in Northwest Mesopotamia . Laban , your mother ’ s brother , lives there . Marry one of his daughters .
NCV	Genesis	28	3	May God Almighty bless you and give you many children , and may you become a group of many peoples .
NCV	Genesis	28	4	May he give you and your descendants the blessing of Abraham so that you may own the land where you are now living as a stranger , the land God gave to Abraham. ”
NCV	Genesis	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob to Northwest Mesopotamia , to Laban the brother of Rebekah . Bethuel the Aramean was the father of Laban and Rebekah , and Rebekah was the mother of Jacob and Esau .
NCV	Genesis	28	6	Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Northwest Mesopotamia to find a wife there . He also learned that Isaac had commanded Jacob not to marry a Canaanite woman
NCV	Genesis	28	7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Northwest Mesopotamia .
NCV	Genesis	28	8	So Esau saw that his father Isaac did not want his sons to marry Canaanite women .

NCV	Genesis	28	12	Jacob dreamed that there was a ladder resting on the earth and reaching up into heaven , and he saw angels of God going up and coming down the ladder .
NCV	Genesis	28	13	Then Jacob saw the Lord standing above the ladder , and he said , “ I am the Lord , the God of Abraham your grandfather , and the God of Isaac . I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are now sleeping .
NCV	Genesis	28	14	Your descendants will be as many as the dust of the earth . They will spread west and east , north and south , and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants .
NCV	Genesis	28	15	I am with you and will protect you everywhere you go and will bring you back to this land . I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. ”
NCV	Genesis	28	16	Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said , “ Surely the Lord is in this place , but I did not know it. ”
NCV	Genesis	28	17	He was afraid and said , “ This place frightens me ! It is surely the house of God and the gate of heaven. ”
NCV	Genesis	28	18	Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone he had slept on and set it up on its end . Then he poured olive oil on the top of it .
NCV	Genesis	28	19	At first , the name of that city was Luz , but Jacob named it Bethel . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	28	20	Then Jacob made a promise . He said , “ I want God to be with me and to protect me on this journey . I want him to give me food to eat and clothes to wear
NCV	Genesis	28	21	so I will be able to return in peace to my father ’ s house . If the Lord does these things , he will be my God .

NCV	Genesis	29	29	( Laban gave his slave girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant . )
NCV	Genesis	29	2	He looked and saw a well in the field and three flocks of sheep lying nearby , because they drank water from this well . A large stone covered the mouth of the well .
NCV	Genesis	29	3	When all the flocks would gather there , the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well and water the sheep . Then they would put the stone back in its place .
NCV	Genesis	29	4	Jacob said to the shepherds there , “ My brothers , where are you from ? ” They answered , “ We are from Haran. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	5	Then Jacob asked , “ Do you know Laban , grandson of Nahor ? ” They answered , “ We know him. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	6	Then Jacob asked , “ How is he ? ” They answered , “ He is well . Look , his daughter Rachel is coming now with his sheep. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	7	Jacob said , “ But look , it is still the middle of the day . It is not time for the sheep to be gathered for the night , so give them water and let them go back into the pasture. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	8	But they said , “ We can not do that until all the flocks are gathered . Then we will roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	9	While Jacob was talking with the shepherds , Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep , because it was her job to care for the sheep .
NCV	Genesis	29	10	When Jacob saw Laban ’ s daughter Rachel and Laban ’ s sheep , he went to the well and rolled the stone from its mouth and watered Laban ’ s sheep . Now Laban was the brother of Rebekah , Jacob ’ s mother .
NCV	Genesis	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and cried .
NCV	Genesis	29	12	He told her that he was from her father ’ s family and that he was the son of Rebekah . So Rachel ran home and told her father .
NCV	Genesis	29	13	When Laban heard the news about his sister ’ s son Jacob , he ran to meet him . Laban hugged him and kissed him and brought him to his house , where Jacob told Laban everything that had happened .
NCV	Genesis	29	14	Then Laban said , “ You are my own flesh and blood. ” Jacob Is Tricked Jacob stayed there a month .
NCV	Genesis	29	15	Then Laban said to Jacob , “ You are my relative , but it is not right for you to work for me without pay . What would you like me to pay you ? ”
NCV	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters . The older was Leah , and the younger was Rachel .
NCV	Genesis	29	17	Leah had weak eyes , but Rachel was very beautiful .
NCV	Genesis	29	18	Jacob loved Rachel , so he said to Laban , “ Let me marry your younger daughter Rachel . If you will , I will work seven years for you. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	19	Laban said , “ It would be better for her to marry you than someone else , so stay here with me. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob worked for Laban seven years so he could marry Rachel . But they seemed like just a few days to him because he loved Rachel very much .
NCV	Genesis	29	21	After seven years Jacob said to Laban , “ Give me Rachel so that I may marry her . The time I promised to work for you is over. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	22	So Laban gave a feast for all the people there .
NCV	Genesis	29	23	That evening he brought his daughter Leah to Jacob , and they had sexual relations .
NCV	Genesis	29	24	( Laban gave his slave girl Zilpah to his daughter to be her servant . )
NCV	Genesis	29	25	In the morning when Jacob saw that he had had sexual relations with Leah , he said to Laban , “ What have you done to me ? I worked hard for you so that I could marry Rachel ! Why did you trick me ? ”
NCV	Genesis	29	26	Laban said , “ In our country we do not allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter .
NCV	Genesis	29	27	But complete the full week of the marriage ceremony with Leah , and I will give you Rachel to marry also . But you must serve me another seven years. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	28	So Jacob did this , and when he had completed the week with Leah , Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife .
NCV	Genesis	29	30	So Jacob had sexual relations with Rachel also , and Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah . Jacob worked for Laban for another seven years . Jacob ’ s Family Grows
NCV	Genesis	29	31	When the Lord saw that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah , he made it possible for Leah to have children , but not Rachel .
NCV	Genesis	29	32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She named him Reuben , [ a ] because she said , “ The Lord has seen my troubles . Surely now my husband will love me. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	33	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son . She named him Simeon [ b ] and said , “ The Lord has heard that I am not loved , so he has given me this son. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	34	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son . She named him Levi [ c ] and said , “ Now , surely my husband will be close to me , because I have given him three sons. ”
NCV	Genesis	29	35	Then Leah gave birth to another son . She named him Judah , [ d ] because she said , “ Now I will praise the Lord. ” Then Leah stopped having children . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	30	30	When I came , you had little , but now you have much . Every time I did something for you , the Lord blessed you . But when will I be able to do something for my own family ? ”
NCV	Genesis	30	2	Jacob became angry with her and said , “ Can I do what only God can do ? He is the one who has kept you from having children. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	3	Then Rachel said , “ Here is my slave girl Bilhah . Have sexual relations with her so she can give birth to a child for me . Then I can have my own family through her. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	4	So Rachel gave Bilhah , her slave girl , to Jacob as a wife , and he had sexual relations with her .
NCV	Genesis	30	5	She became pregnant and gave Jacob a son .
NCV	Genesis	30	6	Rachel said , “ God has judged me innocent . He has listened to my prayer and has given me a son , ” so she named him Dan . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	30	7	Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son .
NCV	Genesis	30	8	Rachel said , “ I have struggled hard with my sister , and I have won. ” So she named that son Naphtali . [ b ]
NCV	Genesis	30	9	Leah saw that she had stopped having children , so she gave her slave girl Zilpah to Jacob as a wife .
NCV	Genesis	30	10	When Zilpah had a son ,
NCV	Genesis	30	11	Leah said , “ I am lucky , ” so she named him Gad . [ c ]
NCV	Genesis	30	12	Zilpah gave birth to another son ,
NCV	Genesis	30	13	and Leah said , “ I am very happy ! Now women will call me happy , ” so she named him Asher . [ d ]
NCV	Genesis	30	14	During the wheat harvest Reuben went into the field and found some mandrake [ e ] plants and brought them to his mother Leah . But Rachel said to Leah , “ Please give me some of your son ’ s mandrakes. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	15	Leah answered , “ You have already taken away my husband , and now you are trying to take away my son ’ s mandrakes. ” But Rachel answered , “ If you will give me your son ’ s mandrakes , you may sleep with Jacob tonight. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	16	When Jacob came in from the field that night , Leah went out to meet him . She said , “ You will have sexual relations with me tonight because I have paid for you with my son ’ s mandrakes. ” So Jacob slept with her that night .
NCV	Genesis	30	17	Then God answered Leah ’ s prayer , and she became pregnant again . She gave birth to a fifth son
NCV	Genesis	30	18	and said , “ God has given me what I paid for , because I gave my slave girl to my husband. ” So Leah named her son Issachar . [ f ]
NCV	Genesis	30	19	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son .
NCV	Genesis	30	20	She said , “ God has given me a fine gift . Now surely Jacob will honor me , because I have given him six sons , ” so she named him Zebulun . [ g ]
NCV	Genesis	30	21	Later Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah .
NCV	Genesis	30	22	Then God remembered Rachel and answered her prayer , making it possible for her to have children .
NCV	Genesis	30	23	When she became pregnant and gave birth to a son , she said , “ God has taken away my shame , ”
NCV	Genesis	30	24	and she named him Joseph . [ h ] Rachel said , “ I wish the Lord would give me another son. ” Jacob Tricks Laban
NCV	Genesis	30	25	After the birth of Joseph , Jacob said to Laban , “ Now let me go to my own home and country .
NCV	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and my children and let me go . I have earned them by working for you , and you know that I have served you well. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	27	Laban said to him , “ If I have pleased you , please stay . I know the Lord has blessed me because of you .
NCV	Genesis	30	28	Tell me what I should pay you , and I will give it to you. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	29	Jacob answered , “ You know that I have worked hard for you , and your flocks have grown while I cared for them .
NCV	Genesis	30	31	Laban asked , “ Then what should I give you ? ” Jacob answered , “ I don ’ t want you to give me anything . Just do this one thing , and I will come back and take care of your flocks .
NCV	Genesis	30	32	Today let me go through all your flocks . I will take every speckled or spotted sheep , every black lamb , and every spotted or speckled goat . That will be my pay .
NCV	Genesis	30	33	In the future you can easily see if I am honest . When you come to look at my flocks , if I have any goat that isn ’ t speckled or spotted or any lamb that isn ’ t black , you will know I stole it. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	34	Laban answered , “ Agreed ! We will do what you ask. ”
NCV	Genesis	30	35	But that day Laban took away all the male goats that had streaks or spots , all the speckled and spotted female goats ( all those that had white on them ) , and all the black sheep . He told his sons to watch over them .
NCV	Genesis	30	36	Then he took these animals to a place that was three days ’ journey away from Jacob . Jacob took care of all the flocks that were left .
NCV	Genesis	30	37	So Jacob cut green branches from poplar , almond , and plane trees and peeled off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them .
NCV	Genesis	30	38	He put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places . When the animals came to drink , they also mated there ,
NCV	Genesis	30	39	so the flocks mated in front of the branches . Then the young that were born were streaked , speckled , or spotted .
NCV	Genesis	30	40	Jacob separated the young animals from the others , and he made them face the streaked and dark animals in Laban ’ s flock . Jacob kept his animals separate from Laban ’ s .
NCV	Genesis	30	41	When the stronger animals in the flock were mating , Jacob put the branches before their eyes so they would mate near the branches .
NCV	Genesis	30	42	But when the weaker animals mated , Jacob did not put the branches there . So the animals born from the weaker animals were Laban ’ s , and those born from the stronger animals were Jacob ’ s .
NCV	Genesis	30	43	In this way Jacob became very rich . He had large flocks , many male and female servants , camels , and donkeys .

NCV	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered Laban , “ I left without telling you , because I was afraid you would take your daughters away from me .
NCV	Genesis	31	2	Then Jacob noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before .
NCV	Genesis	31	3	The Lord said to Jacob , “ Go back to the land where your ancestors lived , and I will be with you. ”
NCV	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob told Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks .
NCV	Genesis	31	5	He said to them , “ I have seen that your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be , but the God of my father has been with me .
NCV	Genesis	31	6	You both know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father ,
NCV	Genesis	31	7	but he cheated me and changed my pay ten times . But God has not allowed your father to harm me .
NCV	Genesis	31	8	When Laban said , ‘ You can have all the speckled animals as your pay , ’ all the animals gave birth to speckled young ones . But when he said , ‘ You can have all the streaked animals as your pay , ’ all the flocks gave birth to streaked babies .
NCV	Genesis	31	9	So God has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me .
NCV	Genesis	31	10	“ I had a dream during the season when the flocks were mating . I saw that the only male goats who were mating were streaked , speckled , or spotted .
NCV	Genesis	31	11	The angel of God spoke to me in that dream and said , ‘ Jacob ! ’ I answered , ‘ Yes ! ’
NCV	Genesis	31	12	The angel said , ‘ Look ! Only the streaked , speckled , or spotted male goats are mating . I have seen all the wrong things Laban has been doing to you .
NCV	Genesis	31	13	I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel , where you poured olive oil on the stone you set up on end and where you made a promise to me . Now I want you to leave here and go back to the land where you were born. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	31	14	Rachel and Leah answered Jacob , “ Our father has nothing to give us when he dies .
NCV	Genesis	31	15	He has treated us like strangers . He sold us to you , and then he spent all of the money you paid for us .
NCV	Genesis	31	16	God took all this wealth from our father , and now it belongs to us and our children . So do whatever God has told you to do. ”
NCV	Genesis	31	17	So Jacob put his children and his wives on camels ,
NCV	Genesis	31	18	and they began their journey back to Isaac , his father , in the land of Canaan . All the flocks of animals that Jacob owned walked ahead of them . He carried everything with him that he had gotten while he lived in Northwest Mesopotamia .
NCV	Genesis	31	19	While Laban was gone to cut the wool from his sheep , Rachel stole the idols that belonged to him .
NCV	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving .
NCV	Genesis	31	21	Jacob and his family left quickly , crossed the Euphrates River , and traveled toward the mountains of Gilead .
NCV	Genesis	31	22	Three days later Laban learned that Jacob had run away ,
NCV	Genesis	31	23	so he gathered his relatives and began to chase him . After seven days Laban found him in the mountains of Gilead .
NCV	Genesis	31	24	That night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and said , “ Be careful ! Do not say anything to Jacob , good or bad. ” The Search for the Stolen Idols
NCV	Genesis	31	25	So Laban caught up with Jacob . Now Jacob had made his camp in the mountains , so Laban and his relatives set up their camp in the mountains of Gilead .
NCV	Genesis	31	26	Laban said to Jacob , “ What have you done ? You cheated me and took my daughters as if you had captured them in a war .
NCV	Genesis	31	27	Why did you run away secretly and trick me ? Why didn ’ t you tell me ? Then I could have sent you away with joy and singing and with the music of tambourines and harps .
NCV	Genesis	31	28	You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-bye . You were very foolish to do this !
NCV	Genesis	31	29	I have the power to harm you , but last night the God of your father spoke to me and warned me not to say anything to you , good or bad .
NCV	Genesis	31	30	I know you want to go back to your home , but why did you steal my idols ? ”
NCV	Genesis	31	32	If you find anyone here who has taken your idols , that person will be killed ! Your relatives will be my witnesses . You may look for anything that belongs to you and take anything that is yours. ” ( Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban ’ s idols . )
NCV	Genesis	31	33	So Laban looked in Jacob ’ s tent , in Leah ’ s tent , and in the tent where the two slave women stayed , but he did not find his idols . When he left Leah ’ s tent , he went into Rachel ’ s tent .
NCV	Genesis	31	34	Rachel had hidden the idols inside her camel ’ s saddle and was sitting on them . Although Laban looked through the whole tent , he did not find them .
NCV	Genesis	31	35	Rachel said to her father , “ Father , don ’ t be angry with me . I am not able to stand up before you because I am having my monthly period. ” So Laban looked through the camp , but he did not find his idols .
NCV	Genesis	31	36	Then Jacob became very angry and said , “ What wrong have I done ? What law have I broken to cause you to chase me ?
NCV	Genesis	31	37	You have looked through everything I own , but you have found nothing that belongs to you . If you have found anything , show it to everyone . Put it in front of your relatives and my relatives , and let them decide which one of us is right .
NCV	Genesis	31	38	I have worked for you now for twenty years . During all that time none of the lambs and kids died during birth , and I have not eaten any of the male sheep from your flocks .
NCV	Genesis	31	39	Any time an animal was killed by wild beasts , I did not bring it to you , but made up for the loss myself . You made me pay for any animal that was stolen during the day or night .
NCV	Genesis	31	40	In the daytime the sun took away my strength , and at night I was cold and could not sleep .
NCV	Genesis	31	41	I worked like a slave for you for twenty years—the first fourteen to get your two daughters and the last six to earn your flocks . During that time you changed my pay ten times .
NCV	Genesis	31	42	But the God of my father , the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac , was with me . Otherwise , you would have sent me away with nothing . But he saw the trouble I had and the hard work I did , and last night he corrected you. ” Jacob and Laban ’ s Agreement
NCV	Genesis	31	43	Laban said to Jacob , “ These girls are my daughters . Their children belong to me , and these flocks are mine . Everything you see here belongs to me , but I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children .
NCV	Genesis	31	44	Let us make an agreement , and let us set up a pile of stones to remind us of it. ”
NCV	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob took a large rock and set it up on its end .
NCV	Genesis	31	46	He told his relatives to gather rocks , so they took the rocks and piled them up ; then they ate beside the pile .
NCV	Genesis	31	47	Laban named that place in his language A Pile to Remind Us , and Jacob gave the place the same name in Hebrew .
NCV	Genesis	31	48	Laban said to Jacob , “ This pile of rocks will remind us of the agreement between us. ” That is why the place was called A Pile to Remind Us .
NCV	Genesis	31	49	It was also called Mizpah , [ a ] because Laban said , “ Let the Lord watch over us while we are separated from each other .
NCV	Genesis	31	50	Remember that God is our witness even if no one else is around us . He will know if you harm my daughters or marry other women .
NCV	Genesis	31	51	Here is the pile of rocks that I have put between us and here is the rock I set up on end .
NCV	Genesis	31	52	This pile of rocks and this rock set on end will remind us of our agreement . I will never go past this pile to hurt you , and you must never come to my side of them to hurt me .
NCV	Genesis	31	53	Let the God of Abraham , who is the God of Nahor and the God of their ancestors , punish either of us if we break this agreement. ” So Jacob made a promise in the name of the God whom his father Isaac worshiped .
NCV	Genesis	31	54	Then Jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice on the mountain , and he invited his relatives to share in the meal . After they finished eating , they spent the night on the mountain .
NCV	Genesis	31	55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them , and then he left to return home . Footnotes - 31:49 Mizpah This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “ watch. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	32	2	When he saw them , he said , “ This is the camp of God ! ” So he named that place Mahanaim . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	32	3	Jacob ’ s brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the country of Edom . Jacob sent messengers to Esau ,
NCV	Genesis	32	4	telling them , “ Give this message to my master Esau : ‘ This is what Jacob , your servant , says : I have lived with Laban and have remained there until now .
NCV	Genesis	32	5	I have cattle , donkeys , flocks , and male and female servants . I send this message to you and ask you to accept us. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	32	6	The messengers returned to Jacob and said , “ We went to your brother Esau . He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	7	Then Jacob was very afraid and worried . He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks , herds , and camels into two camps .
NCV	Genesis	32	8	Jacob thought , “ Esau might come and destroy one camp , but the other camp can run away and be saved. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	9	Then Jacob said , “ God of my father Abraham ! God of my father Isaac ! Lord , you told me to return to my country and my family . You said that you would treat me well .
NCV	Genesis	32	10	I am not worthy of the kindness and continual goodness you have shown me . The first time I traveled across the Jordan River , I had only my walking stick , but now I own enough to have two camps .
NCV	Genesis	32	11	Please save me from my brother Esau . I am afraid he will come and kill all of us , even the mothers with the children .
NCV	Genesis	32	12	You said to me , ‘ I will treat you well and will make your children as many as the sand of the seashore . There will be too many to count. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	32	13	Jacob stayed there for the night and prepared a gift for Esau from what he had with him :
NCV	Genesis	32	14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats , two hundred female sheep and twenty male sheep ,
NCV	Genesis	32	15	thirty female camels and their young , forty cows and ten bulls , twenty female donkeys , and ten male donkeys .
NCV	Genesis	32	16	Jacob gave each separate flock of animals to one of his servants and said to them , “ Go ahead of me and keep some space between each herd. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	17	Jacob gave them their orders . To the servant with the first group of animals he said , “ My brother Esau will come to you and ask , ‘ Whose servant are you ? Where are you going and whose animals are these ? ’
NCV	Genesis	32	18	Then you will answer , ‘ They belong to your servant Jacob . He sent them as a gift to you , my master Esau , and he also is coming behind us. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	32	19	Jacob ordered the second servant , the third servant , and all the other servants to do the same thing . He said , “ Say the same thing to Esau when you meet him .
NCV	Genesis	32	20	Say , ‘ Your servant Jacob is coming behind us. ’ ” Jacob thought , “ If I send these gifts ahead of me , maybe Esau will forgive me . Then when I see him , perhaps he will accept me. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	21	So Jacob sent the gifts to Esau , but he himself stayed that night in the camp . Jacob Wrestles with God
NCV	Genesis	32	22	During the night Jacob rose and crossed the Jabbok River at the crossing , taking with him his two wives , his two slave girls , and his eleven sons .
NCV	Genesis	32	23	He sent his family and everything he had across the river .
NCV	Genesis	32	24	So Jacob was alone , and a man came and wrestled with him until the sun came up .
NCV	Genesis	32	25	When the man saw he could not defeat Jacob , he struck Jacob ’ s hip and put it out of joint .
NCV	Genesis	32	26	Then he said to Jacob , “ Let me go . The sun is coming up. ” But Jacob said , “ I will let you go if you will bless me. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	27	The man said to him , “ What is your name ? ” And he answered , “ Jacob. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	28	Then the man said , “ Your name will no longer be Jacob . Your name will now be Israel , [ b ] because you have wrestled with God and with people , and you have won. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	29	Then Jacob asked him , “ Please tell me your name. ” But the man said , “ Why do you ask my name ? ” Then he blessed Jacob there .
NCV	Genesis	32	30	So Jacob named that place Peniel , [ c ] saying , “ I have seen God face to face , but my life was saved. ”
NCV	Genesis	32	31	Then the sun rose as he was leaving that place , and Jacob was limping because of his leg .
NCV	Genesis	32	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Genesis	33	33	Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming , and with him were four hundred men . So Jacob divided his children among Leah , Rachel , and the two slave girls .
NCV	Genesis	33	2	Jacob put the slave girls with their children first , then Leah and her children behind them , and Rachel and Joseph last .
NCV	Genesis	33	3	Jacob himself went out in front of them and bowed down flat on the ground seven times as he was walking toward his brother .
NCV	Genesis	33	4	But Esau ran to meet Jacob and put his arms around him and hugged him . Then Esau kissed him , and they both cried .
NCV	Genesis	33	5	When Esau looked up and saw the women and children , he asked , “ Who are these people with you ? ” Jacob answered , “ These are the children God has given me . God has been good to me , your servant. ”
NCV	Genesis	33	6	Then the two slave girls and their children came up to Esau and bowed down flat on the earth before him .
NCV	Genesis	33	7	Leah and her children also came up to Esau and also bowed down flat on the earth . Last of all , Joseph and Rachel came up to Esau , and they , too , bowed down flat before him .
NCV	Genesis	33	8	Esau said , “ I saw many herds as I was coming here . Why did you bring them ? ” Jacob answered , “ They were to please you , my master. ”
NCV	Genesis	33	9	But Esau said , “ I already have enough , my brother . Keep what you have. ”
NCV	Genesis	33	10	Jacob said , “ No ! Please ! If I have pleased you , then accept the gift I give you . I am very happy to see your face again . It is like seeing the face of God , because you have accepted me .
NCV	Genesis	33	11	So I beg you to accept the gift I give you . God has been very good to me , and I have more than I need. ” And because Jacob begged , Esau accepted the gift .
NCV	Genesis	33	12	Then Esau said , “ Let us be going . I will travel with you. ”
NCV	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , “ My master , you know that the children are weak . And I must be careful with my flocks and their young ones . If I force them to go too far in one day , all the animals will die .
NCV	Genesis	33	14	So , my master , you go on ahead of me , your servant . I will follow you slowly and let the animals and the children set the speed at which we travel . I will meet you , my master , in Edom. ”
NCV	Genesis	33	15	So Esau said , “ Then let me leave some of my people with you. ” “ No , thank you , ” said Jacob . “ I only want to please you , my master. ”
NCV	Genesis	33	16	So that day Esau started back to Edom .
NCV	Genesis	33	17	But Jacob went to Succoth , where he built a house for himself and shelters for his animals . That is why the place was named Succoth . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	33	18	Jacob left Northwest Mesopotamia and arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan . There he camped east of the city .
NCV	Genesis	33	19	He bought a part of the field where he had camped from the sons of Hamor father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver .
NCV	Genesis	33	20	He built an altar there and named it after God , the God of Israel . Footnotes - 33:17 Succoth This name means “ shelters. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	34	34	At this time Dinah , the daughter of Leah and Jacob , went out to visit the women of the land .
NCV	Genesis	34	2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite , the ruler of the land , saw her , he took her and forced her to have sexual relations with him .
NCV	Genesis	34	3	Shechem fell in love with Dinah , and he spoke kindly to her .
NCV	Genesis	34	4	He told his father , Hamor , “ Please get this girl for me so I can marry her. ”
NCV	Genesis	34	5	Jacob learned how Shechem had disgraced his daughter , but since his sons were out in the field with the cattle , Jacob said nothing until they came home .
NCV	Genesis	34	6	While he waited , Hamor father of Shechem went to talk with Jacob .
NCV	Genesis	34	7	When Jacob ’ s sons heard what had happened , they came in from the field . They were very angry that Shechem had done such a wicked thing to Israel . It was wrong for him to have sexual relations with Jacob ’ s daughter ; a thing like this should not be done .
NCV	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor talked to Dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ My son Shechem is deeply in love with Dinah . Please let him marry her .
NCV	Genesis	34	9	Marry our people . Give your women to our men as wives and take our women for your men as wives .
NCV	Genesis	34	10	You can live in the same land with us . You will be free to own land and to trade here. ”
NCV	Genesis	34	11	Shechem also talked to Jacob and to Dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ Please accept my offer . I will give anything you ask .
NCV	Genesis	34	12	Ask as much as you want for the payment for the bride , and I will give it to you . Just let me marry Dinah. ”
NCV	Genesis	34	13	Jacob ’ s sons answered Shechem and his father with lies , because Shechem had disgraced their sister Dinah .
NCV	Genesis	34	14	The brothers said to them , “ We can not allow you to marry our sister , because you are not circumcised . That would be a disgrace to us .
NCV	Genesis	34	15	But we will allow you to marry her if you do this one thing : Every man in your town must be circumcised like us .
NCV	Genesis	34	16	Then your men can marry our women , and our men can marry your women , and we will live in your land and become one people .
NCV	Genesis	34	17	If you refuse to be circumcised , we will take Dinah and leave. ”
NCV	Genesis	34	18	What they asked seemed fair to Hamor and Shechem .
NCV	Genesis	34	19	So Shechem quickly went to be circumcised because he loved Jacob ’ s daughter . Now Shechem was the most respected man in his family .
NCV	Genesis	34	20	So Hamor and Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city , saying ,
NCV	Genesis	34	21	“ These people want to be friends with us . So let them live in our land and trade here . There is enough land for all of us . Let us marry their women , and we can let them marry our women .
NCV	Genesis	34	22	But we must agree to one thing : All our men must be circumcised as they are . Then they will agree to live in our land , and we will be one people .
NCV	Genesis	34	23	If we do this , their cattle and their animals will belong to us . Let us do what they say , and they will stay in our land. ”
NCV	Genesis	34	24	All the people who had come to the city gate heard this . They agreed with Hamor and Shechem , and every man was circumcised .
NCV	Genesis	34	25	Three days later the men who were circumcised were still in pain . Two of Jacob ’ s sons , Simeon and Levi ( Dinah ’ s brothers ) , took their swords and made a surprise attack on the city , killing all the men there .
NCV	Genesis	34	26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem and then took Dinah out of Shechem ’ s house and left .
NCV	Genesis	34	27	Jacob ’ s sons came upon the dead bodies and stole everything that was in the city , to pay them back for what Shechem had done to their sister .
NCV	Genesis	34	28	So the brothers took the flocks , herds , and donkeys , and everything in the city and in the fields .
NCV	Genesis	34	29	They took every valuable thing the people owned , even their wives and children and everything in the houses .
NCV	Genesis	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ You have caused me a lot of trouble . Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites who live in the land will hate me . Since there are only a few of us , if they join together to attack us , my people and I will be destroyed. ”

NCV	Genesis	35	35	God said to Jacob , “ Go to the city of Bethel and live there . Make an altar to the God who appeared to you there when you were running away from your brother Esau. ”
NCV	Genesis	35	2	So Jacob said to his family and to all who were with him , “ Put away the foreign gods you have , and make yourselves clean , and change your clothes .
NCV	Genesis	35	3	We will leave here and go to Bethel . There I will build an altar to God , who has helped me during my time of trouble . He has been with me everywhere I have gone. ”
NCV	Genesis	35	4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had , and the earrings they were wearing , and he hid them under the great tree near the town of Shechem .
NCV	Genesis	35	5	Then Jacob and his sons left there . But God caused the people in the nearby cities to be afraid , so they did not follow them .
NCV	Genesis	35	6	And Jacob and all the people who were with him went to Luz , which is now called Bethel , in the land of Canaan .
NCV	Genesis	35	7	There Jacob built an altar and named the place Bethel , after God , because God had appeared to him there when he was running from his brother .
NCV	Genesis	35	8	Deborah , Rebekah ’ s nurse , died and was buried under the oak tree at Bethel , so they named that place Oak of Crying . Jacob ’ s New Name
NCV	Genesis	35	9	When Jacob came back from Northwest Mesopotamia , God appeared to him again and blessed him .
NCV	Genesis	35	10	God said to him , “ Your name is Jacob , but you will not be called Jacob any longer . Your new name will be Israel. ” So he called him Israel .
NCV	Genesis	35	11	God said to him , “ I am God Almighty . Have many children and grow in number as a nation . You will be the ancestor of many nations and kings .
NCV	Genesis	35	12	The same land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and your descendants. ”
NCV	Genesis	35	13	Then God left him .
NCV	Genesis	35	14	Jacob set up a stone on edge in that place where God had talked to him , and he poured a drink offering and olive oil on it to make it special for God .
NCV	Genesis	35	15	And Jacob named the place Bethel . Rachel Dies Giving Birth
NCV	Genesis	35	16	Jacob and his group left Bethel . Before they came to Ephrath , Rachel began giving birth to her baby ,
NCV	Genesis	35	17	but she was having much trouble . When Rachel ’ s nurse saw this , she said , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Rachel . You are giving birth to another son. ”
NCV	Genesis	35	18	Rachel gave birth to the son , but she herself died . As she lay dying , she named the boy Son of My Suffering , but Jacob called him Benjamin . [ a ]
NCV	Genesis	35	19	Rachel was buried on the road to Ephrath , a district of Bethlehem ,
NCV	Genesis	35	20	and Jacob set up a rock on her grave to honor her . That rock is still there .
NCV	Genesis	35	21	Then Israel [ b ] continued his journey and camped just south of Migdal Eder .
NCV	Genesis	35	22	While Israel was there , Reuben had sexual relations with Israel ’ s slave woman Bilhah , and Israel heard about it . The Family of Israel Jacob had twelve sons .
NCV	Genesis	35	23	He had six sons by his wife Leah : Reuben , his first son , then Simeon , Levi , Judah , Issachar , and Zebulun .
NCV	Genesis	35	24	He had two sons by his wife Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin .
NCV	Genesis	35	25	He had two sons by Rachel ’ s slave girl Bilhah : Dan and Naphtali .
NCV	Genesis	35	26	And he had two sons by Leah ’ s slave girl Zilpah : Gad and Asher . These are Jacob ’ s sons who were born in Northwest Mesopotamia .
NCV	Genesis	35	27	Jacob went to his father Isaac at Mamre near Hebron , where Abraham and Isaac had lived .

NCV	Genesis	37	37	Jacob lived in the land of Canaan , where his father had lived .
NCV	Genesis	37	2	This is the family history of Jacob : Joseph was a young man , seventeen years old . He and his brothers , the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah , his father ’ s wives , cared for the flocks . Joseph gave his father bad reports about his brothers .
NCV	Genesis	37	3	Since Joseph was born when his father Israel [ a ] was old , Israel loved him more than his other sons . He made Joseph a special robe with long sleeves .
NCV	Genesis	37	4	When Joseph ’ s brothers saw that their father loved him more than he loved them , they hated their brother and could not speak to him politely .
NCV	Genesis	37	5	One time Joseph had a dream , and when he told his brothers about it , they hated him even more .
NCV	Genesis	37	6	Joseph said , “ Listen to the dream I had .
NCV	Genesis	37	7	We were in the field tying bundles of wheat together . My bundle stood up , and your bundles of wheat gathered around it and bowed down to it. ”
NCV	Genesis	37	8	His brothers said , “ Do you really think you will be king over us ? Do you truly think you will rule over us ? ” His brothers hated him even more because of his dreams and what he had said .
NCV	Genesis	37	9	Then Joseph had another dream , and he told his brothers about it also . He said , “ Listen , I had another dream . I saw the sun , moon , and eleven stars bowing down to me. ”
NCV	Genesis	37	10	Joseph also told his father about this dream , but his father scolded him , saying , “ What kind of dream is this ? Do you really believe that your mother , your brothers , and I will bow down to you ? ”
NCV	Genesis	37	11	Joseph ’ s brothers were jealous of him , but his father thought about what all these things could mean .
NCV	Genesis	37	12	One day Joseph ’ s brothers went to Shechem to graze their father ’ s flocks .
NCV	Genesis	37	13	Israel said to Joseph , “ Go to Shechem where your brothers are grazing the flocks. ” Joseph answered , “ I will go. ”
NCV	Genesis	37	14	His father said , “ Go and see if your brothers and the flocks are all right . Then come back and tell me. ” So Joseph ’ s father sent him from the Valley of Hebron . When Joseph came to Shechem ,
NCV	Genesis	37	15	a man found him wandering in the field and asked him , “ What are you looking for ? ”
NCV	Genesis	37	16	Joseph answered , “ I am looking for my brothers . Can you tell me where they are grazing the flocks ? ”
NCV	Genesis	37	17	The man said , “ They have already gone . I heard them say they were going to Dothan. ” So Joseph went to look for his brothers and found them in Dothan . Joseph Sold into Slavery
NCV	Genesis	37	18	Joseph ’ s brothers saw him coming from far away . Before he reached them , they made a plan to kill him .
NCV	Genesis	37	19	They said to each other , “ Here comes that dreamer .
NCV	Genesis	37	20	Let ’ s kill him and throw his body into one of the wells . We can tell our father that a wild animal killed him . Then we will see what will become of his dreams. ”
NCV	Genesis	37	21	But Reuben heard their plan and saved Joseph , saying , “ Let ’ s not kill him .
NCV	Genesis	37	22	Don ’ t spill any blood . Throw him into this well here in the desert , but don ’ t hurt him ! ” Reuben planned to save Joseph later and send him back to his father .
NCV	Genesis	37	23	So when Joseph came to his brothers , they pulled off his robe with long sleeves
NCV	Genesis	37	24	and threw him into the well . It was empty , and there was no water in it .
NCV	Genesis	37	25	While Joseph was in the well , the brothers sat down to eat . When they looked up , they saw a group of Ishmaelites traveling from Gilead to Egypt . Their camels were carrying spices , balm , and myrrh .
NCV	Genesis	37	26	Then Judah said to his brothers , “ What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his death ?
NCV	Genesis	37	27	Let ’ s sell him to these Ishmaelites . Then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother . After all , he is our brother , our own flesh and blood. ” And the other brothers agreed .
NCV	Genesis	37	28	So when the Midianite traders came by , the brothers took Joseph out of the well and sold him to the Ishmaelites for eight ounces of silver . And the Ishmaelites took him to Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	37	29	When Reuben came back to the well and Joseph was not there , he tore his clothes to show he was upset .
NCV	Genesis	37	30	Then he went back to his brothers and said , “ The boy is not there ! What shall I do ? ”
NCV	Genesis	37	31	The brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph ’ s robe in its blood .
NCV	Genesis	37	32	Then they brought the long-sleeved robe to their father and said , “ We found this robe . Look it over carefully and see if it is your son ’ s robe. ”
NCV	Genesis	37	33	Jacob looked it over and said , “ It is my son ’ s robe ! Some savage animal has eaten him . My son Joseph has been torn to pieces ! ”
NCV	Genesis	37	34	Then Jacob tore his clothes and put on rough cloth to show that he was upset , and he continued to be sad about his son for a long time .
NCV	Genesis	37	35	All of his sons and daughters tried to comfort him , but he could not be comforted . He said , “ I will be sad about my son until the day I die. ” So Jacob cried for his son Joseph .
NCV	Genesis	37	36	Meanwhile the Midianites who had bought Joseph had taken him to Egypt . There they sold him to Potiphar , an officer to the king of Egypt and captain of the palace guard . Footnotes - 37:3 Israel Also called Jacob . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	38	38	About that time , Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah in the town of Adullam .
NCV	Genesis	38	2	There Judah met a Canaanite girl , the daughter of a man named Shua , and married her . Judah had sexual relations with her ,
NCV	Genesis	38	3	and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son , whom Judah named Er .
NCV	Genesis	38	4	Later she gave birth to another son and named him Onan .
NCV	Genesis	38	5	Still later she had another son and named him Shelah . She was at Kezib when this third son was born .
NCV	Genesis	38	6	Judah chose a girl named Tamar to be the wife of his first son Er .
NCV	Genesis	38	7	But Er , Judah ’ s oldest son , did what the Lord said was evil , so the Lord killed him .
NCV	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Er ’ s brother Onan , “ Go and have sexual relations with your dead brother ’ s wife . [ a ] It is your duty to provide children for your brother in this way. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	9	But Onan knew that the children would not belong to him , so when he was supposed to have sexual relations with Tamar he did not complete the sex act . This made it impossible for Tamar to become pregnant and for Er to have descendants .
NCV	Genesis	38	10	The Lord was displeased by this wicked thing Onan had done , so the Lord killed Onan also .
NCV	Genesis	38	11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar , “ Go back to live in your father ’ s house , and don ’ t marry until my young son Shelah grows up. ” Judah was afraid that Shelah also would die like his brothers . So Tamar returned to her father ’ s home .
NCV	Genesis	38	12	After a long time Judah ’ s wife , the daughter of Shua , died . After Judah had gotten over his sorrow , he went to Timnah to his men who were cutting the wool from his sheep . His friend Hirah from Adullam went with him .
NCV	Genesis	38	13	Tamar learned that Judah , her father-in-law , was going to Timnah to cut the wool from his sheep .
NCV	Genesis	38	14	So she took off the clothes that showed she was a widow and covered her face with a veil to hide who she was . Then she sat down by the gate of Enaim on the road to Timnah . She did this because Judah ’ s younger son Shelah had grown up , but Judah had not made plans for her to marry him .
NCV	Genesis	38	15	When Judah saw her , he thought she was a prostitute , because she had covered her face with a veil .
NCV	Genesis	38	16	So Judah went to her and said , “ Let me have sexual relations with you. ” He did not know that she was Tamar , his daughter-in-law . She asked , “ What will you give me if I let you have sexual relations with me ? ”
NCV	Genesis	38	17	Judah answered , “ I will send you a young goat from my flock. ” She answered , “ First give me something to keep as a deposit until you send the goat. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	18	Judah asked , “ What do you want me to give you as a deposit ? ” Tamar answered , “ Give me your seal and its cord , [ b ] and give me your walking stick. ” So Judah gave these things to her . Then Judah and Tamar had sexual relations , and Tamar became pregnant .
NCV	Genesis	38	19	When Tamar went home , she took off the veil that covered her face and put on the clothes that showed she was a widow .
NCV	Genesis	38	20	Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat to find the woman and get back his seal and the walking stick he had given her , but Hirah could not find her .
NCV	Genesis	38	21	He asked some of the people at the town of Enaim , “ Where is the prostitute who was here by the road ? ” They answered , “ There has never been a prostitute here. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	22	So he went back to Judah and said , “ I could not find the woman , and the people who lived there said , ‘ There has never been a prostitute here. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	38	23	Judah said , “ Let her keep the things . I don ’ t want people to laugh at us . I sent her the goat as I promised , but you could not find her. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	24	About three months later someone told Judah , “ Tamar , your daughter-in-law , is guilty of acting like a prostitute , and now she is pregnant. ” Then Judah said , “ Bring her out and let her be burned to death. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	25	When the people went to bring Tamar out , she sent a message to her father-in-law that said , “ The man who owns these things has made me pregnant . Look at this seal and its cord and this walking stick , and tell me whose they are. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	26	Judah recognized them and said , “ She is more in the right than I . She did this because I did not give her to my son Shelah as I promised. ” And Judah did not have sexual relations with her again .
NCV	Genesis	38	27	When the time came for Tamar to give birth , there were twins in her body .
NCV	Genesis	38	28	While she was giving birth , one baby put his hand out . The nurse tied a red string on his hand and said , “ This baby came out first. ”
NCV	Genesis	38	29	But he pulled his hand back in , so the other baby was born first . The nurse said , “ So you are able to break out first , ” and they named him Perez . [ c ]
NCV	Genesis	38	30	After this , the baby with the red string on his hand was born , and they named him Zerah .

NCV	Genesis	39	4	So Potiphar was very happy with Joseph and allowed him to be his personal servant . He put Joseph in charge of the house , trusting him with everything he owned .
NCV	Genesis	39	5	When Joseph was put in charge of the house and everything Potiphar owned , the Lord blessed the people in Potiphar ’ s house because of Joseph . And the Lord blessed everything that belonged to Potiphar , both in the house and in the field .
NCV	Genesis	39	6	So Potiphar left Joseph in charge of everything he owned and was not concerned about anything except the food he ate . Joseph Is Put into Prison Now Joseph was well built and handsome .
NCV	Genesis	39	7	After some time the wife of Joseph ’ s master began to desire Joseph , and one day she said to him , “ Have sexual relations with me. ”
NCV	Genesis	39	8	But Joseph refused and said to her , “ My master trusts me with everything in his house . He has put me in charge of everything he owns .
NCV	Genesis	39	9	There is no one in his house greater than I . He has not kept anything from me except you , because you are his wife . How can I do such an evil thing ? It is a sin against God. ”
NCV	Genesis	39	10	The woman talked to Joseph every day , but he refused to have sexual relations with her or even spend time with her .
NCV	Genesis	39	11	One day Joseph went into the house to do his work as usual and was the only man in the house at that time .
NCV	Genesis	39	12	His master ’ s wife grabbed his coat and said to him , “ Come and have sexual relations with me. ” But Joseph left his coat in her hand and ran out of the house .
NCV	Genesis	39	13	When she saw that Joseph had left his coat in her hands and had run outside ,
NCV	Genesis	39	14	she called to the servants in her house and said , “ Look ! This Hebrew slave was brought here to shame us . He came in and tried to have sexual relations with me , but I screamed .
NCV	Genesis	39	15	My scream scared him and he ran away , but he left his coat with me. ”
NCV	Genesis	39	16	She kept his coat until her husband came home ,
NCV	Genesis	39	17	and she told him the same story . She said , “ This Hebrew slave you brought here came in to shame me !
NCV	Genesis	39	18	When he came near me , I screamed . He ran away , but he left his coat. ”
NCV	Genesis	39	19	When Joseph ’ s master heard what his wife said Joseph had done , he became very angry .
NCV	Genesis	39	20	So Potiphar arrested Joseph and put him into the prison where the king ’ s prisoners were put . And Joseph stayed there in the prison .
NCV	Genesis	39	21	But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him kindness and caused the prison warden to like Joseph .
NCV	Genesis	39	22	The prison warden chose Joseph to take care of all the prisoners , and he was responsible for whatever was done in the prison .
NCV	Genesis	39	23	The warden paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph ’ s care because the Lord was with Joseph and made him successful in everything he did . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	40	40	After these things happened , two of the king ’ s officers displeased the king—the man who served wine to the king and the king ’ s baker .
NCV	Genesis	40	2	The king became angry with his officer who served him wine and his baker ,
NCV	Genesis	40	3	so he put them in the prison of the captain of the guard , the same prison where Joseph was kept .
NCV	Genesis	40	4	The captain of the guard put the two prisoners in Joseph ’ s care , and they stayed in prison for some time .
NCV	Genesis	40	5	One night both the king ’ s officer who served him wine and the baker had a dream . Each had his own dream with its own meaning .
NCV	Genesis	40	6	When Joseph came to them the next morning , he saw they were worried .
NCV	Genesis	40	7	He asked the king ’ s officers who were with him , “ Why do you look so unhappy today ? ”
NCV	Genesis	40	8	The two men answered , “ We both had dreams last night , but no one can explain their meaning to us. ” Joseph said to them , “ God is the only One who can explain the meaning of dreams . Tell me your dreams. ”
NCV	Genesis	40	9	So the man who served wine to the king told Joseph his dream . He said , “ I dreamed I saw a vine , and
NCV	Genesis	40	10	on the vine were three branches . I watched the branches bud and blossom , and then the grapes ripened .
NCV	Genesis	40	11	I was holding the king ’ s cup , so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup . Then I gave it to the king. ”
NCV	Genesis	40	12	Then Joseph said , “ I will explain the dream to you . The three branches stand for three days .
NCV	Genesis	40	13	Before the end of three days the king will free you , and he will allow you to return to your work . You will serve the king his wine just as you did before .
NCV	Genesis	40	14	But when you are free , remember me . Be kind to me , and tell the king about me so I can get out of this prison .
NCV	Genesis	40	15	I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews , and I have done nothing here to deserve being put in prison. ”
NCV	Genesis	40	16	The baker saw that Joseph ’ s explanation of the dream was good , so he said to him , “ I also had a dream . I dreamed there were three bread baskets on my head .
NCV	Genesis	40	17	In the top basket were all kinds of baked food for the king , but the birds were eating this food out of the basket on my head. ”
NCV	Genesis	40	18	Joseph answered , “ I will tell you what the dream means . The three baskets stand for three days .
NCV	Genesis	40	19	Before the end of three days , the king will cut off your head ! He will hang your body on a pole , and the birds will eat your flesh. ”
NCV	Genesis	40	20	Three days later , on his birthday , the king gave a feast for all his officers . In front of his officers , he released from prison the chief officer who served his wine and the chief baker .
NCV	Genesis	40	21	The king gave his chief officer who served wine his old position , and once again he put the king ’ s cup of wine into the king ’ s hand .
NCV	Genesis	40	22	But the king hanged the baker on a pole . Everything happened just as Joseph had said it would ,
NCV	Genesis	40	23	but the officer who served wine did not remember Joseph . He forgot all about him . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	41	41	Then the king said to Joseph , “ Look ! I have put you in charge of all the land of Egypt. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	2	He saw seven fat and beautiful cows come up out of the river , and they stood there , eating the grass .
NCV	Genesis	41	3	Then seven more cows came up out of the river , but they were thin and ugly . They stood beside the seven beautiful cows on the bank of the Nile .
NCV	Genesis	41	4	The seven thin and ugly cows ate the seven beautiful fat cows . Then the king woke up .
NCV	Genesis	41	5	The king slept again and dreamed a second time . In his dream he saw seven full and good heads of grain growing on one stalk .
NCV	Genesis	41	6	After that , seven more heads of grain sprang up , but they were thin and burned by the hot east wind .
NCV	Genesis	41	7	The thin heads of grain ate the seven full and good heads . Then the king woke up again , and he realized it was only a dream .
NCV	Genesis	41	8	The next morning the king was troubled about these dreams , so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt . The king told them his dreams , but no one could explain their meaning to him .
NCV	Genesis	41	9	Then the chief officer who served wine to the king said to him , “ Now I remember something I promised to do , but I forgot about it .
NCV	Genesis	41	10	There was a time when you were angry with the baker and me , and you put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard .
NCV	Genesis	41	11	In prison we each had a dream on the same night , and each dream had a different meaning .
NCV	Genesis	41	12	A young Hebrew man , a servant of the captain of the guard , was in the prison with us . When we told him our dreams , he explained their meanings to us . He told each man the meaning of his dream , and
NCV	Genesis	41	13	things happened exactly as he said they would : I was given back my old position , and the baker was hanged. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	14	So the king called for Joseph . The guards quickly brought him out of the prison , and he shaved , put on clean clothes , and went before the king .
NCV	Genesis	41	15	The king said to Joseph , “ I have had a dream , but no one can explain its meaning to me . I have heard that you can explain a dream when someone tells it to you. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	16	Joseph answered the king , “ I am not able to explain the meaning of dreams , but God will do this for the king. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	17	Then the king said to Joseph , “ In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile River .
NCV	Genesis	41	18	I saw seven fat and beautiful cows that came up out of the river and ate the grass .
NCV	Genesis	41	19	Then I saw seven more cows come out of the river that were thin and lean and ugly—the worst looking cows I have seen in all the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	20	And these thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows ,
NCV	Genesis	41	21	but after they had eaten the seven cows , no one could tell they had eaten them . They looked just as thin and ugly as they did in the beginning . Then I woke up .
NCV	Genesis	41	22	“ I had another dream . I saw seven full and good heads of grain growing on one stalk .
NCV	Genesis	41	23	Then seven more heads of grain sprang up after them , but these heads were thin and ugly and were burned by the hot east wind .
NCV	Genesis	41	24	Then the thin heads ate the seven good heads . I told this dream to the magicians , but no one could explain its meaning to me. ” Joseph Tells the Dreams ’ Meaning
NCV	Genesis	41	25	Then Joseph said to the king , “ Both of these dreams mean the same thing . God is telling you what he is about to do .
NCV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows stand for seven years , and the seven good heads of grain stand for seven years . Both dreams mean the same thing .
NCV	Genesis	41	27	The seven thin and ugly cows stand for seven years , and the seven thin heads of grain burned by the hot east wind stand for seven years of hunger .
NCV	Genesis	41	28	This will happen as I told you . God is showing the king what he is about to do .
NCV	Genesis	41	29	You will have seven years of good crops and plenty to eat in all the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	30	But after those seven years , there will come seven years of hunger , and all the food that grew in the land of Egypt will be forgotten . The time of hunger will eat up the land .
NCV	Genesis	41	31	People will forget what it was like to have plenty of food , because the hunger that follows will be so great .
NCV	Genesis	41	32	You had two dreams which mean the same thing . This shows that God has firmly decided that this will happen , and he will make it happen soon .
NCV	Genesis	41	33	“ So let the king choose a man who is very wise and understanding and set him over the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	34	And let the king also appoint officers over the land , who should take one-fifth of all the food that is grown during the seven good years .
NCV	Genesis	41	35	They should gather all the food that is produced during the good years that are coming , and under the king ’ s authority they should store the grain in the cities and guard it .
NCV	Genesis	41	36	That food should be saved to use during the seven years of hunger that will come on the land of Egypt . Then the people in Egypt will not die during the seven years of hunger. ” Joseph Is Made Ruler over Egypt
NCV	Genesis	41	37	This seemed like a very good idea to the king , and all his officers agreed .
NCV	Genesis	41	38	And the king asked them , “ Can we find a better man than Joseph to take this job ? God ’ s spirit is truly in him ! ”
NCV	Genesis	41	39	So the king said to Joseph , “ God has shown you all this . There is no one as wise and understanding as you are , so
NCV	Genesis	41	40	I will put you in charge of my palace . All the people will obey your orders , and only I will be greater than you. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	42	Then the king took off from his own finger his ring with the royal seal on it , and he put it on Joseph ’ s finger . He gave Joseph fine linen clothes to wear , and he put a gold chain around Joseph ’ s neck .
NCV	Genesis	41	43	The king had Joseph ride in the second royal chariot , and people walked ahead of his chariot calling , “ Bow down ! ” By doing these things , the king put Joseph in charge of all of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	44	The king said to him , “ I am the king , and I say that no one in all the land of Egypt may lift a hand or a foot without your permission. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	45	The king gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah . He also gave Joseph a wife named Asenath , who was the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On . So Joseph traveled through all the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was thirty years old when he began serving the king of Egypt . And he left the king ’ s court and traveled through all the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	47	During the seven good years , the crops in the land grew well .
NCV	Genesis	41	48	And Joseph gathered all the food produced in Egypt during those seven years of good crops and stored the food in the cities . In every city he stored grain that had been grown in the fields around that city .
NCV	Genesis	41	49	Joseph stored much grain , as much as the sand of the seashore—so much that he could not measure it .
NCV	Genesis	41	50	Joseph ’ s wife was Asenath daughter of Potiphera , the priest of On . Before the years of hunger came , Joseph and Asenath had two sons .
NCV	Genesis	41	51	Joseph named the first son Manasseh [ a ] and said , “ God has made me forget all the troubles I have had and all my father ’ s family. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	52	Joseph named the second son Ephraim [ b ] and said , “ God has given me children in the land of my troubles. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	53	The seven years of good crops came to an end in the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	54	Then the seven years of hunger began , just as Joseph had said . In all the lands people had nothing to eat , but in Egypt there was food .
NCV	Genesis	41	55	The time of hunger became terrible in all of Egypt , and the people cried to the king for food . He said to all the Egyptians , “ Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you. ”
NCV	Genesis	41	56	The hunger was everywhere in that part of the world . And Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the people of Egypt , because the time of hunger became terrible in Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	41	57	And all the people in that part of the world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain because the hunger was terrible everywhere in that part of the world . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	42	42	Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt , so he said to his sons , “ Why are you just sitting here looking at one another ?
NCV	Genesis	42	2	I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . Go down there and buy grain for us to eat , so that we will live and not die. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	3	So ten of Joseph ’ s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	42	4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin , Joseph ’ s brother , with them , because he was afraid that something terrible might happen to him .
NCV	Genesis	42	5	Along with many other people , the sons of Israel [ a ] went to Egypt to buy grain , because the people in the land of Canaan were also hungry .
NCV	Genesis	42	6	Now Joseph was governor over Egypt . He was the one who sold the grain to people who came to buy it . So Joseph ’ s brothers came to him and bowed facedown on the ground before him .
NCV	Genesis	42	7	When Joseph saw his brothers , he knew who they were , but he acted as if he didn ’ t know them . He asked unkindly , “ Where do you come from ? ” They answered , “ We have come from the land of Canaan to buy food. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	8	Joseph knew they were his brothers , but they did not know who he was .
NCV	Genesis	42	9	And Joseph remembered his dreams about his brothers bowing to him . He said to them , “ You are spies ! You came to learn where the nation is weak ! ”
NCV	Genesis	42	10	But his brothers said to him , “ No , my master . We come as your servants just to buy food .
NCV	Genesis	42	11	We are all sons of the same father . We are honest men , not spies. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	12	Then Joseph said to them , “ No ! You have come to learn where this nation is weak ! ”
NCV	Genesis	42	13	And they said , “ We are ten of twelve brothers , sons of the same father , and we live in the land of Canaan . Our youngest brother is there with our father right now , and our other brother is gone. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	14	But Joseph said to them , “ I can see I was right ! You are spies !
NCV	Genesis	42	15	But I will give you a way to prove you are telling the truth . As surely as the king lives , you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here .
NCV	Genesis	42	16	One of you must go and get your brother . The rest of you will stay here in prison . We will see if you are telling the truth . If not , as surely as the king lives , you are spies. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	17	Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days .
NCV	Genesis	42	18	On the third day Joseph said to them , “ I am a God-fearing man . Do this and I will let you live :
NCV	Genesis	42	19	If you are honest men , let one of your brothers stay here in prison while the rest of you go and carry grain back to feed your hungry families .
NCV	Genesis	42	20	Then bring your youngest brother back here to me . If you do this , I will know you are telling the truth , and you will not die. ” The brothers agreed to this .
NCV	Genesis	42	21	They said to each other , “ We are being punished for what we did to our brother . We saw his trouble , and he begged us to save him , but we refused to listen . That is why we are in this trouble now. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	22	Then Reuben said to them , “ I told you not to harm the boy , but you refused to listen to me . So now we are being punished for what we did to him. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	23	When Joseph talked to his brothers , he used an interpreter , so they did not know that Joseph understood what they were saying .
NCV	Genesis	42	24	Then Joseph left them and cried . After a short time he went back and spoke to them . He took Simeon and tied him up while the other brothers watched .
NCV	Genesis	42	25	Joseph told his servants to fill his brothers ’ bags with grain and to put the money the brothers had paid for the grain back in their bags . The servants were also to give them what they would need for their trip back home . And the servants did this .
NCV	Genesis	42	26	So the brothers put the grain on their donkeys and left .
NCV	Genesis	42	27	When they stopped for the night , one of the brothers opened his sack to get food for his donkey . Then he saw his money in the top of the sack .
NCV	Genesis	42	28	He said to the other brothers , “ The money I paid for the grain has been put back . Here it is in my sack ! ” The brothers were very frightened . They said to each other , “ What has God done to us ? ” The Brothers Return to Jacob
NCV	Genesis	42	29	The brothers went to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him everything that had happened .
NCV	Genesis	42	30	They said , “ The master of that land spoke unkindly to us . He accused us of spying on his country ,
NCV	Genesis	42	31	but we told him that we were honest men , not spies .
NCV	Genesis	42	32	We told him that we were ten of twelve brothers—sons of one father . We said that one of our brothers was gone and that our youngest brother was with our father in Canaan .
NCV	Genesis	42	33	“ Then the master of the land said to us , ‘ Here is a way I can know you are honest men : Leave one of your brothers with me , and take grain to feed your hungry families , and go .
NCV	Genesis	42	34	And bring your youngest brother to me so I will know you are not spies but honest men . Then I will give you back your brother whom you leave with me , and you can move about freely in our land. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	42	35	As the brothers emptied their sacks , each of them found his money in his sack . When they and their father saw it , they were afraid .
NCV	Genesis	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them , “ You are robbing me of all my children . Joseph is gone , Simeon is gone , and now you want to take Benjamin away , too . Everything is against me. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	37	Then Reuben said to his father , “ You may put my two sons to death if I don ’ t bring Benjamin back to you . Trust him to my care , and I will bring him back to you. ”
NCV	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob said , “ I will not allow Benjamin to go with you . His brother is dead , and he is the only son left from my wife Rachel . I am afraid something terrible might happen to him during the trip to Egypt . Then I would be sad until the day I die. ” Footnotes - 42:5 Israel Also called Jacob .

NCV	Genesis	43	43	Still no food grew in the land of Canaan .
NCV	Genesis	43	2	When Jacob ’ s family had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt , Jacob said to them , “ Go to Egypt again and buy a little more grain for us to eat. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	3	But Judah said to Jacob , “ The governor of that country strongly warned us , ‘ If you don ’ t bring your brother back with you , you will not be allowed to see me. ’
NCV	Genesis	43	4	If you will send Benjamin with us , we will go down and buy food for you .
NCV	Genesis	43	5	But if you refuse to send Benjamin , we will not go . The governor of that country warned us that we would not see him if we didn ’ t bring Benjamin with us. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	6	Israel [ a ] said , “ Why did you tell the man you had another brother ? You have caused me a lot of trouble. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	7	The brothers answered , “ He questioned us carefully about ourselves and our family . He asked us , ‘ Is your father still alive ? Do you have another brother ? ’ We just answered his questions . How could we know he would ask us to bring our other brother to him ? ”
NCV	Genesis	43	8	Then Judah said to his father Jacob , “ Send Benjamin with me , and we will go at once so that we , you , and our children may live and not die .
NCV	Genesis	43	9	I will guarantee you that he will be safe , and I will be personally responsible for him . If I don ’ t bring him back to you , you can blame me all my life .
NCV	Genesis	43	10	If we had not wasted all this time , we could have already made two trips. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	11	Then their father Jacob said to them , “ If it has to be that way , then do this : Take some of the best foods in our land in your packs . Give them to the man as a gift : some balm , some honey , spices , myrrh , pistachio nuts , and almonds .
NCV	Genesis	43	12	Take twice as much money with you this time , and take back the money that was returned to you in your sacks last time . Maybe it was a mistake .
NCV	Genesis	43	13	And take Benjamin with you . Now leave and go to the man .
NCV	Genesis	43	14	I pray that God Almighty will cause the governor to be merciful to you and that he will allow Simeon and Benjamin to come back with you . If I am robbed of my children , then I am robbed of them ! ”
NCV	Genesis	43	15	So the brothers took the gifts . They also took twice as much money as they had taken the first time , and they took Benjamin . They hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph .
NCV	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to the servant in charge of his house , “ Bring those men into my house . Kill an animal and prepare a meal . Those men will eat with me today at noon. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	17	The servant did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph ’ s house .
NCV	Genesis	43	18	The brothers were afraid when they were brought to Joseph ’ s house and thought , “ We were brought here because of the money that was put in our sacks on the first trip . He wants to attack us , make us slaves , and take our donkeys. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	19	So the brothers went to the servant in charge of Joseph ’ s house and spoke to him at the door of the house .
NCV	Genesis	43	20	They said , “ Master , we came here once before to buy food .
NCV	Genesis	43	21	While we were going home , we stopped for the night and when we opened our sacks each of us found all his money in his sack . We brought that money with us to give it back to you .
NCV	Genesis	43	22	And we have brought more money to pay for the food we want to buy this time . We don ’ t know who put that money in our sacks. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	23	But the servant answered , “ It ’ s all right . Don ’ t be afraid . Your God , the God of your father , must have put the money in your sacks . I got the money you paid me for the grain last time. ” Then the servant brought Simeon out to them .
NCV	Genesis	43	24	The servant led the men into Joseph ’ s house and gave them water , and they washed their feet . Then he gave their donkeys food to eat .
NCV	Genesis	43	25	The men prepared their gift to give to Joseph when he arrived at noon , because they had heard they were going to eat with him there .
NCV	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , the brothers gave him the gift they had brought into the house and bowed down to the ground in front of him .
NCV	Genesis	43	27	Joseph asked them how they were doing . He said , “ How is your aged father you told me about ? Is he still alive ? ”
NCV	Genesis	43	28	The brothers answered , “ Your servant , our father , is well . He is still alive. ” And they bowed low before Joseph to show him respect .
NCV	Genesis	43	29	When Joseph saw his brother Benjamin , who had the same mother as he , Joseph asked , “ Is this your youngest brother you told me about ? ” Then he said to Benjamin , “ God be good to you , my son ! ”
NCV	Genesis	43	30	Then Joseph hurried off because he had to hold back the tears when he saw his brother Benjamin . So Joseph went into his room and cried there .
NCV	Genesis	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out . He controlled himself and said , “ Serve the meal. ”
NCV	Genesis	43	32	So they served Joseph at one table , his brothers at another table , and the Egyptians who ate with him at another table . This was because Egyptians did not like Hebrews and never ate with them .
NCV	Genesis	43	33	Joseph ’ s brothers were seated in front of him in order of their ages , from oldest to youngest . They looked at each other because they were so amazed .
NCV	Genesis	43	34	Food from Joseph ’ s table was taken to them , but Benjamin was given five times more food than the others . Joseph ’ s brothers ate and drank freely with him . Footnotes - 43:6 Israel Also called Jacob . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Genesis	43	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Genesis	44	44	Then Joseph gave a command to the servant in charge of his house . He said , “ Fill the men ’ s sacks with as much grain as they can carry , and put each man ’ s money into his sack with the grain .
NCV	Genesis	44	2	Put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother , along with his money for the grain. ” The servant did what Joseph told him .
NCV	Genesis	44	3	At dawn the brothers were sent away with their donkeys .
NCV	Genesis	44	4	They were not far from the city when Joseph said to the servant in charge of his house , “ Go after the men . When you catch up with them , say , ‘ Why have you paid back evil for good ?
NCV	Genesis	44	5	The cup you have stolen is the one my master uses for drinking and for explaining dreams . You have done a very wicked thing ! ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	44	6	So the servant caught up with the brothers and said to them what Joseph had told him to say .
NCV	Genesis	44	7	But the brothers said to the servant , “ Why do you say these things ? We would not do anything like that !
NCV	Genesis	44	8	We brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in our sacks . So surely we would not steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house .
NCV	Genesis	44	9	If you find that silver cup in the sack of one of us , then let him die , and we will be your slaves. ”
NCV	Genesis	44	10	The servant said , “ We will do as you say , but only the man who has taken the cup will become my slave . The rest of you may go free. ”
NCV	Genesis	44	11	Then every brother quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it .
NCV	Genesis	44	12	The servant searched the sacks , going from the oldest brother to the youngest , and found the cup in Benjamin ’ s sack .
NCV	Genesis	44	13	The brothers tore their clothes to show they were afraid . Then they put their sacks back on the donkeys and returned to the city .
NCV	Genesis	44	14	When Judah and his brothers went back to Joseph ’ s house , Joseph was still there , so the brothers bowed facedown on the ground before him .
NCV	Genesis	44	15	Joseph said to them , “ What have you done ? Didn ’ t you know that a man like me can learn things by signs and dreams ? ”
NCV	Genesis	44	16	Judah said , “ Master , what can we say ? And how can we show we are not guilty ? God has uncovered our guilt , so all of us will be your slaves , not just Benjamin. ”
NCV	Genesis	44	17	But Joseph said , “ I will not make you all slaves ! Only the man who stole the cup will be my slave . The rest of you may go back safely to your father. ”
NCV	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah went to Joseph and said , “ Master , please let me speak plainly to you , and please don ’ t be angry with me . I know that you are as powerful as the king of Egypt himself .
NCV	Genesis	44	19	When we were here before , you asked us , ‘ Do you have a father or a brother ? ’
NCV	Genesis	44	20	And we answered you , ‘ We have an old father . And we have a younger brother , who was born when our father was old . This youngest son ’ s brother is dead , so he is the only one of his mother ’ s children left alive , and our father loves him very much. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	21	Then you said to us , ‘ Bring that brother to me . I want to see him. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	22	And we said to you , ‘ That young boy can not leave his father , because if he leaves him , his father would die. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	23	But you said to us , ‘ If you don ’ t bring your youngest brother , you will not be allowed to see me again. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	24	So we went back to our father and told him what you had said .
NCV	Genesis	44	25	“ Later , our father said , ‘ Go again and buy us a little more food. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	26	We said to our father , ‘ We can not go without our youngest brother . Without our youngest brother , we will not be allowed to see the governor. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	27	Then my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife Rachel gave me two sons .
NCV	Genesis	44	28	When one son left me , I thought , “ Surely he has been torn apart by a wild animal , ” and I haven ’ t seen him since .
NCV	Genesis	44	29	Now you want to take this son away from me also . But something terrible might happen to him , and I would be miserable until the day I die. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	30	Now what will happen if we go home to our father without our youngest brother ? He is so important in our father ’ s life that
NCV	Genesis	44	31	when our father sees the young boy is not with us , he will die . And it will be our fault . We will cause the great sorrow that kills our father .
NCV	Genesis	44	32	“ I gave my father a guarantee that the young boy would be safe . I said to my father , ‘ If I don ’ t bring him back to you , you can blame me all my life. ’
NCV	Genesis	44	33	So now , please allow me to stay here and be your slave , and let the young boy go back home with his brothers .
NCV	Genesis	44	34	I can not go back to my father if the boy is not with me . I couldn ’ t stand to see my father that sad. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	45	45	Joseph could not control himself in front of his servants any longer , so he cried out , “ Have everyone leave me. ” When only the brothers were left with Joseph , he told them who he was .
NCV	Genesis	45	2	Joseph cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him , and the people in the king ’ s palace heard about it .
NCV	Genesis	45	3	He said to his brothers , “ I am Joseph . Is my father still alive ? ” But the brothers could not answer him , because they were very afraid of him .
NCV	Genesis	45	4	So Joseph said to them , “ Come close to me. ” When the brothers came close to him , he said to them , “ I am your brother Joseph , whom you sold as a slave to go to Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	45	5	Now don ’ t be worried or angry with yourselves because you sold me here . God sent me here ahead of you to save people ’ s lives .
NCV	Genesis	45	6	No food has grown on the land for two years now , and there will be five more years without planting or harvest .
NCV	Genesis	45	7	So God sent me here ahead of you to make sure you have some descendants left on earth and to keep you alive in an amazing way .
NCV	Genesis	45	8	So it was not you who sent me here , but God . God has made me the highest officer of the king of Egypt . I am in charge of his palace , and I am the master of all the land of Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	45	9	“ So leave quickly and go to my father . Tell him , ‘ Your son Joseph says : God has made me master over all Egypt . Come down to me quickly .
NCV	Genesis	45	10	Live in the land of Goshen where you will be near me . Your children , your grandchildren , your flocks and herds , and all that you have will also be near me .
NCV	Genesis	45	11	I will care for you during the next five years of hunger so that you and your family and all that you have will not starve. ’
NCV	Genesis	45	12	“ Now you can see for yourselves , and so can my brother Benjamin , that the one speaking to you is really Joseph .
NCV	Genesis	45	13	So tell my father about how powerful I have become in Egypt . Tell him about everything you have seen . Now hurry and bring him back to me. ”
NCV	Genesis	45	14	Then Joseph hugged his brother Benjamin and cried , and Benjamin cried also .
NCV	Genesis	45	15	And Joseph kissed all his brothers and cried as he hugged them . After this , his brothers talked with him .
NCV	Genesis	45	16	When the king of Egypt and his officers learned that Joseph ’ s brothers had come , they were very happy .
NCV	Genesis	45	17	So the king said to Joseph , “ Tell your brothers to load their animals and go back to the land of Canaan
NCV	Genesis	45	18	and bring their father and their families back here to me . I will give them the best land in Egypt , and they will eat the best food we have here .
NCV	Genesis	45	19	Tell them to take some wagons from Egypt for their children and their wives and to bring their father back also .
NCV	Genesis	45	20	Tell them not to worry about bringing any of their things with them , because we will give them the best of what we have in Egypt. ”
NCV	Genesis	45	21	So the sons of Israel did this . Joseph gave them wagons as the king had ordered and food for their trip .
NCV	Genesis	45	22	He gave each brother a change of clothes , but he gave Benjamin five changes of clothes and about seven and one-half pounds of silver .
NCV	Genesis	45	23	Joseph also sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best things from Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain , bread , and other food for his father on his trip back .
NCV	Genesis	45	24	Then Joseph told his brothers to go . As they were leaving , he said to them , “ Don ’ t quarrel on the way home. ”
NCV	Genesis	45	25	So the brothers left Egypt and went to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan .
NCV	Genesis	45	26	They told him , “ Joseph is still alive and is the ruler over all the land of Egypt. ” Their father was shocked and did not believe them .
NCV	Genesis	45	27	But when the brothers told him everything Joseph had said , and when Jacob saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him back to Egypt , he felt better .
NCV	Genesis	45	28	Israel [ a ] said , “ Now I believe you . My son Joseph is still alive , and I will go and see him before I die. ” Footnotes - 45:28 Israel Also called Jacob . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	46	46	So Israel [ a ] took all he had and started his trip . He went to Beersheba , where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac .
NCV	Genesis	46	2	During the night God spoke to Israel in a vision and said , “ Jacob , Jacob. ” And Jacob answered , “ Here I am. ”
NCV	Genesis	46	3	Then God said , “ I am God , the God of your father . Don ’ t be afraid to go to Egypt , because I will make your descendants a great nation there .
NCV	Genesis	46	4	I will go to Egypt with you , and I will bring you out of Egypt again . Joseph ’ s own hands will close your eyes when you die. ”
NCV	Genesis	46	5	Then Jacob left Beersheba . The sons of Israel loaded their father , their children , and their wives in the wagons the king of Egypt had sent .
NCV	Genesis	46	6	They also took their farm animals and everything they had gotten in Canaan . So Jacob went to Egypt with all his descendants—
NCV	Genesis	46	7	his sons and grandsons , his daughters and granddaughters . He took all his family to Egypt with him . Jacob ’ s Family
NCV	Genesis	46	8	Now these are the names of the children of Israel who went into Egypt ( Jacob and his descendants ) . Reuben was Jacob ’ s first son .

NCV	Genesis	46	16	Gad ’ s sons were Zephon , Haggi , Shuni , Ezbon , Eri , Arodi , and Areli .

NCV	Genesis	46	19	The sons of Jacob ’ s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin .
NCV	Genesis	46	20	In Egypt , Joseph became the father of Manasseh and Ephraim by his wife Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , priest of On .

NCV	Genesis	46	26	So the total number of Jacob ’ s direct descendants who went to Egypt was sixty-six , not counting the wives of Jacob ’ s sons .
NCV	Genesis	46	27	Joseph had two sons born in Egypt , so the total number in the family of Jacob in Egypt was seventy . Jacob Arrives in Egypt
NCV	Genesis	46	28	Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to see Joseph in Goshen . When Jacob and his people came into the land of Goshen ,
NCV	Genesis	46	29	Joseph prepared his chariot and went to meet his father Israel in Goshen . As soon as Joseph saw his father , he hugged him , and cried there for a long time .
NCV	Genesis	46	30	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Now I am ready to die , because I have seen your face and I know you are still alive. ”
NCV	Genesis	46	31	Joseph said to his brothers and his father ’ s family , “ I will go and tell the king you are here . I will say , ‘ My brothers and my father ’ s family have left the land of Canaan and have come here to me .
NCV	Genesis	46	32	They are shepherds and take care of farm animals , and they have brought their flocks and their herds and everything they own with them. ’
NCV	Genesis	46	33	When the king calls you , he will ask , ‘ What work do you do ? ’
NCV	Genesis	46	34	This is what you should tell him : ‘ We , your servants , have taken care of farm animals all our lives . Our ancestors did the same thing. ’ Then the king will allow you to settle in the land of Goshen , away from the Egyptians , because they don ’ t like to be near shepherds. ” Footnotes - 46:1 Israel Also called Jacob .

NCV	Genesis	47	47	Joseph went in to the king and said , “ My father and my brothers have arrived from Canaan with their flocks and herds and everything they own . They are now in the land of Goshen. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	2	Joseph chose five of his brothers to introduce to the king .
NCV	Genesis	47	3	The king said to the brothers , “ What work do you do ? ” And they said to him , “ We , your servants , are shepherds , just as our ancestors were. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	4	They said to the king , “ We have come to live in this land , because there is no grass in the land of Canaan for our animals to eat , and the hunger is terrible there . So please allow us to live in the land of Goshen. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	5	Then the king said to Joseph , “ Your father and your brothers have come to you ,
NCV	Genesis	47	6	and you may choose any place in Egypt for them to live . Give your father and your brothers the best land ; let them live in the land of Goshen . And if any of them are skilled shepherds , put them in charge of my sheep and cattle. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and introduced him to the king , and Jacob blessed the king .
NCV	Genesis	47	8	Then the king said to Jacob , “ How old are you ? ”
NCV	Genesis	47	9	Jacob said to him , “ My life has been spent wandering from place to place . It has been short and filled with trouble—only one hundred thirty years . My ancestors lived much longer than I. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	10	Then Jacob blessed the king and left .
NCV	Genesis	47	11	Joseph obeyed the king and gave his father and brothers the best land in Egypt , near the city of Rameses .
NCV	Genesis	47	12	And Joseph gave his father , his brothers , and everyone who lived with them the food they needed . Joseph Buys Land for the King
NCV	Genesis	47	13	The hunger became worse , and since there was no food anywhere in the land , Egypt and Canaan became very poor .
NCV	Genesis	47	14	Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan . People paid for the grain they were buying , and he brought that money to the king ’ s palace .
NCV	Genesis	47	15	After some time , when the people in Egypt and Canaan had no money left , they went to Joseph and said , “ Please give us food . Our money is gone , and if we don ’ t eat , we will die here in front of you. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	16	Joseph answered , “ Since you have no money , give me your farm animals , and I will give you food in return. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	17	So people brought their farm animals to Joseph , and he gave them food in exchange for their horses , sheep , goats , cattle , and donkeys . And he kept them alive by trading food for their farm animals that year .
NCV	Genesis	47	18	The next year the people came to Joseph and said , “ You know we have no money left , and all our animals belong to you . We have nothing left except our bodies and our land .
NCV	Genesis	47	19	Surely both we and our land will die here in front of you . Buy us and our land in exchange for food , and we will be slaves to the king , together with our land . Give us seed to plant so that we will live and not die , and the land will not become a desert. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for the king . Every Egyptian sold Joseph his field , because the hunger was very great . So the land became the king ’ s ,
NCV	Genesis	47	21	and Joseph made the people slaves from one end of Egypt to the other .
NCV	Genesis	47	22	The only land he did not buy was the land the priests owned . They did not need to sell their land because the king paid them for their work . So they had money to buy food .
NCV	Genesis	47	23	Joseph said to the people , “ Now I have bought you and your land for the king , so I will give you seed and you can plant your fields .
NCV	Genesis	47	24	At harvest time you must give one-fifth to the king . You may keep four-fifths for yourselves to use as seed for the field and as food for yourselves , your families , and your children. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	25	The people said , “ You have saved our lives . If you like , we will become slaves of the king. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph made a law in Egypt , which continues today : One-fifth of everything from the land belongs to the king . The only land the king did not get was the priests ’ land . “ Don ’ t Bury Me in Egypt ”
NCV	Genesis	47	27	The Israelites continued to live in the land of Goshen in Egypt . There they got possessions and had many children and grew in number .
NCV	Genesis	47	28	Jacob [ a ] lived in Egypt seventeen years , so he lived to be one hundred forty-seven years old .
NCV	Genesis	47	29	When Israel knew he soon would die , he called his son Joseph to him and said to him , “ If you love me , put your hand under my leg . [ b ] Promise me you will not bury me in Egypt .
NCV	Genesis	47	30	When I die , carry me out of Egypt , and bury me where my ancestors are buried. ” Joseph answered , “ I will do as you say. ”
NCV	Genesis	47	31	Then Jacob said , “ Promise me. ” And Joseph promised him that he would do this . Then Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	48	48	Some time later Joseph learned that his father was very sick , so he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim and went to his father .
NCV	Genesis	48	2	When Joseph arrived , someone told Jacob , [ a ] “ Your son Joseph has come to see you. ” Jacob was weak , so he used all his strength and sat up on his bed .
NCV	Genesis	48	3	Then Jacob said to Joseph , “ God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me there .
NCV	Genesis	48	4	He said to me , ‘ I will give you many children . I will make you the father of many peoples , and I will give your descendants this land forever. ’
NCV	Genesis	48	5	Your two sons , who were born here in Egypt before I came , will be counted as my own sons . Ephraim and Manasseh will be my sons just as Reuben and Simeon are my sons .
NCV	Genesis	48	6	But if you have other children , they will be your own , and their land will be part of the land given to Ephraim and Manasseh .
NCV	Genesis	48	7	When I came from Northwest Mesopotamia , Rachel died in the land of Canaan , as we were traveling toward Ephrath . This made me very sad , and I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath. ” ( Today Ephrath is Bethlehem . )
NCV	Genesis	48	8	Then Israel saw Joseph ’ s sons and said , “ Who are these boys ? ”
NCV	Genesis	48	9	Joseph said to his father , “ They are my sons that God has given me here in Egypt. ” Israel said , “ Bring your sons to me so I may bless them. ”
NCV	Genesis	48	10	At this time Israel ’ s eyesight was bad because he was old . So Joseph brought the boys close to him , and Israel kissed the boys and put his arms around them .
NCV	Genesis	48	11	He said to Joseph , “ I thought I would never see you alive again , and now God has let me see you and also your children. ”
NCV	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph moved his sons off Israel ’ s lap and bowed facedown to the ground .
NCV	Genesis	48	13	He put Ephraim on his right side and Manasseh on his left . ( So Ephraim was near Israel ’ s left hand , and Manasseh was near Israel ’ s right hand . ) Joseph brought the boys close to Israel .
NCV	Genesis	48	14	But Israel crossed his arms and put his right hand on the head of Ephraim , who was younger . He put his left hand on the head of Manasseh , the firstborn son .
NCV	Genesis	48	15	And Israel blessed Joseph and said , “ My ancestors Abraham and Isaac served our God , and like a shepherd God has led me all my life .
NCV	Genesis	48	16	He was the Angel who saved me from all my troubles . Now I pray that he will bless these boys . May my name be known through these boys , and may the names of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac be known through them . May they have many descendants on the earth. ”
NCV	Genesis	48	17	When Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on Ephraim ’ s head , he didn ’ t like it . So he took hold of his father ’ s hand , wanting to move it from Ephraim ’ s head to Manasseh ’ s head .
NCV	Genesis	48	18	Joseph said to his father , “ You are doing it wrong , Father . Manasseh is the firstborn son . Put your right hand on his head. ”
NCV	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , “ I know , my son , I know . Manasseh will be great and have many descendants . But his younger brother will be greater , and his descendants will be enough to make a nation. ”
NCV	Genesis	48	20	So Israel blessed them that day and said , “ When a blessing is given in Israel , they will say : ‘ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh. ’ ” In this way he made Ephraim greater than Manasseh .
NCV	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Look at me ; I am about to die . But God will be with you and will take you back to the land of your fathers .
NCV	Genesis	48	22	I have given you something that I did not give your brothers—the land of Shechem that I took from the Amorite people with my sword and my bow. ” Footnotes - 48:2 Jacob Also called Israel . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Genesis	49	2	“ Come together and listen , sons of Jacob . Listen to Israel , your father. ”
NCV	Genesis	49	3	“ Reuben , my first son , you are my strength . Your birth showed I could be a father . You have the highest position among my sons , and you are the most powerful .
NCV	Genesis	49	4	But you are uncontrolled like water , so you will no longer lead your brothers . This is because you got into your father ’ s bed and shamed me by having sexual relations with my slave girl .
NCV	Genesis	49	5	“ Simeon and Levi are brothers who used their swords to do violence .
NCV	Genesis	49	6	I will not join their secret talks , and I will not meet with them to plan evil . They killed men because they were angry , and they crippled oxen just for fun .
NCV	Genesis	49	7	May their anger be cursed , because it is too violent . May their violence be cursed , because it is too cruel . I will divide them up among the tribes of Jacob and scatter them through all the tribes of Israel .
NCV	Genesis	49	8	“ Judah , your brothers will praise you . You will grab your enemies by the neck , and your brothers will bow down to you .
NCV	Genesis	49	9	Judah is like a young lion . You have returned from killing , my son . Like a lion , he stretches out and lies down to rest , and no one is brave enough to wake him .

NCV	Genesis	49	13	“ Zebulun will live near the sea . His shore will be a safe place for ships , and his land will reach as far as Sidon .
NCV	Genesis	49	14	“ Issachar is like a strong donkey who lies down while carrying his load .
NCV	Genesis	49	15	When he sees his resting place is good and how pleasant his land is , he will put his back to the load and become a slave .
NCV	Genesis	49	16	“ Dan will rule his own people like the other tribes in Israel .
NCV	Genesis	49	17	Dan will be like a snake by the side of the road , a dangerous snake lying near the path . That snake bites a horse ’ s leg , and the rider is thrown off backward .

NCV	Genesis	49	29	Then Israel gave them a command and said , “ I am about to die . Bury me with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite .
NCV	Genesis	49	30	That cave is in the field of Machpelah east of Mamre in the land of Canaan . Abraham bought the field and cave from Ephron the Hittite for a burying place .

NCV	Genesis	50	50	When Jacob died , Joseph hugged his father and cried over him and kissed him .
NCV	Genesis	50	2	He commanded the doctors who served him to prepare his father ’ s body , so the doctors prepared Jacob ’ s body to be buried .
NCV	Genesis	50	3	It took the doctors forty days to prepare his body ( the usual time it took ) . And the Egyptians had a time of sorrow for Jacob that lasted seventy days .
NCV	Genesis	50	4	When this time of sorrow had ended , Joseph spoke to the king ’ s officers and said , “ If you think well of me , please tell this to the king :
NCV	Genesis	50	5	‘ When my father was near death , I made a promise to him that I would bury him in a cave in the land of Canaan , in a burial place that he cut out for himself . So please let me go and bury my father , and then I will return. ’ ”
NCV	Genesis	50	6	The king answered , “ Keep your promise . Go and bury your father. ”
NCV	Genesis	50	7	So Joseph went to bury his father . All the king ’ s officers , the elders of his court , and all the elders of Egypt went with Joseph .
NCV	Genesis	50	8	Everyone who lived with Joseph and his brothers went with him , as well as everyone who lived with his father . They left only their children , their flocks , and their herds in the land of Goshen .

NCV	Exodus	1	1	When Jacob [ a ] went to Egypt , he took his sons , and each son took his own family with him . These are the names of the sons of Israel :
NCV	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi , Judah ,
NCV	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun , Benjamin ,
NCV	Exodus	1	4	Dan , Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
NCV	Exodus	1	5	There was a total of seventy people who were descendants of Jacob . Jacob ’ s son Joseph was already in Egypt .

NCV	Exodus	1	7	But the people of Israel had many children , and their number grew greatly . They became very strong , and the country of Egypt was filled with them . Trouble for the People of Israel
NCV	Exodus	1	8	Then a new king began to rule Egypt , who did not know who Joseph was .
NCV	Exodus	1	9	This king said to his people , “ Look ! The people of Israel are too many and too strong for us to handle !
NCV	Exodus	1	10	If we don ’ t make plans against them , the number of their people will grow even more . Then if there is a war , they might join our enemies and fight us and escape from the country ! ”
NCV	Exodus	1	11	So the Egyptians made life hard for the Israelites . They put slave masters over them , who forced the Israelites to build the cities Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king .
NCV	Exodus	1	12	But the harder the Egyptians forced the Israelites to work , the more the Israelites grew in number and spread out . So the Egyptians became very afraid of them
NCV	Exodus	1	13	and demanded even more of them .
NCV	Exodus	1	14	They made their lives bitter . They forced the Israelites to work hard to make bricks and mortar and to do all kinds of work in the fields . The Egyptians were not merciful to them in all their painful work .
NCV	Exodus	1	15	Two Hebrew nurses , named Shiphrah and Puah , helped the Israelite women give birth to their babies . The king of Egypt said to the nurses ,
NCV	Exodus	1	16	“ When you are helping the Hebrew women give birth to their babies , watch ! If the baby is a girl , let her live , but if it is a boy , kill him ! ”
NCV	Exodus	1	17	But the nurses feared God , so they did not do as the king told them ; they let all the boy babies live .
NCV	Exodus	1	18	Then the king of Egypt sent for the nurses and said , “ Why did you do this ? Why did you let the boys live ? ”
NCV	Exodus	1	19	The nurses said to him , “ The Hebrew women are much stronger than the Egyptian women . They give birth to their babies before we can get there. ”
NCV	Exodus	1	20	God was good to the nurses . And the Hebrew people continued to grow in number , so they became even stronger .
NCV	Exodus	1	21	Because the nurses feared God , he gave them families of their own .
NCV	Exodus	1	22	So the king commanded all his people , “ Every time a boy is born to the Hebrews , you must throw him into the Nile River , but let all the girl babies live. ” Footnotes - 1:1 Jacob Also called Israel . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	2	4	The baby ’ s sister stood a short distance away to see what would happen to him .
NCV	Exodus	2	5	Then the daughter of the king of Egypt came to the river to take a bath , and her servant girls were walking beside the river . When she saw the basket in the tall grass , she sent her slave girl to get it .
NCV	Exodus	2	6	The king ’ s daughter opened the basket and saw the baby boy . He was crying , so she felt sorry for him and said , “ This is one of the Hebrew babies. ”
NCV	Exodus	2	7	Then the baby ’ s sister asked the king ’ s daughter , “ Would you like me to go and find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you ? ”
NCV	Exodus	2	8	The king ’ s daughter said , “ Go ! ” So the girl went and got the baby ’ s own mother .
NCV	Exodus	2	9	The king ’ s daughter said to the woman , “ Take this baby and nurse him for me , and I will pay you. ” So the woman took her baby and nursed him .
NCV	Exodus	2	10	When the child grew older , the woman took him to the king ’ s daughter , and she adopted the baby as her own son . The king ’ s daughter named him Moses , [ a ] because she had pulled him out of the water . Moses Tries to Help
NCV	Exodus	2	11	Moses grew and became a man . One day he visited his people and saw that they were forced to work very hard . He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew man , one of Moses ’ own people .
NCV	Exodus	2	12	Moses looked all around and saw that no one was watching , so he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand .
NCV	Exodus	2	13	The next day Moses returned and saw two Hebrew men fighting each other . He said to the one that was in the wrong , “ Why are you hitting one of your own people ? ”
NCV	Exodus	2	14	The man answered , “ Who made you our ruler and judge ? Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptian ? ” Moses was afraid and thought , “ Now everyone knows what I did. ”
NCV	Exodus	2	15	When the king heard what Moses had done , he tried to kill him . But Moses ran away from the king and went to live in the land of Midian . There he sat down near a well . Moses in Midian

NCV	Exodus	2	17	Some shepherds came and chased the girls away , but Moses defended the girls and watered their flock .
NCV	Exodus	2	18	When they went back to their father Reuel , [ b ] he asked them , “ Why have you come home early today ? ”
NCV	Exodus	2	19	The girls answered , “ The shepherds chased us away , but an Egyptian defended us . He got water for us and watered our flock. ”
NCV	Exodus	2	20	He asked his daughters , “ Where is this man ? Why did you leave him ? Invite him to eat with us. ”
NCV	Exodus	2	21	Moses agreed to stay with Jethro , and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses to be his wife .
NCV	Exodus	2	22	Zipporah gave birth to a son . Moses named him Gershom , [ c ] because Moses was a stranger in a land that was not his own .
NCV	Exodus	2	23	After a long time , the king of Egypt died . The people of Israel groaned , because they were forced to work very hard . When they cried for help , God heard them .
NCV	Exodus	2	24	God heard their cries , and he remembered the agreement he had made with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .

NCV	Exodus	3	3	So he said , “ I will go closer to this strange thing . How can a bush continue burning without burning up ? ”
NCV	Exodus	3	2	There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire coming out of a bush . Moses saw that the bush was on fire , but it was not burning up .
NCV	Exodus	3	4	When the Lord saw Moses was coming to look at the bush , God called to him from the bush , “ Moses , Moses ! ” And Moses said , “ Here I am. ”
NCV	Exodus	3	5	Then God said , “ Do not come any closer . Take off your sandals , because you are standing on holy ground .
NCV	Exodus	3	6	I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ” Moses covered his face because he was afraid to look at God .
NCV	Exodus	3	7	The Lord said , “ I have seen the troubles my people have suffered in Egypt , and I have heard their cries when the Egyptian slave masters hurt them . I am concerned about their pain ,
NCV	Exodus	3	8	and I have come down to save them from the Egyptians . I will bring them out of that land and lead them to a good land with lots of room—a fertile land . It is the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
NCV	Exodus	3	9	I have heard the cries of the people of Israel , and I have seen the way the Egyptians have made life hard for them .
NCV	Exodus	3	10	So now I am sending you to the king of Egypt . Go ! Bring my people , the Israelites , out of Egypt ! ”
NCV	Exodus	3	11	But Moses said to God , “ I am not a great man ! How can I go to the king and lead the Israelites out of Egypt ? ”
NCV	Exodus	3	12	God said , “ I will be with you . This will be the proof that I am sending you : After you lead the people out of Egypt , all of you will worship me on this mountain. ”
NCV	Exodus	3	13	Moses said to God , “ When I go to the Israelites , I will say to them , ‘ The God of your ancestors sent me to you. ’ What if the people say , ‘ What is his name ? ’ What should I tell them ? ”
NCV	Exodus	3	14	Then God said to Moses , “ I am who I am . [ a ] When you go to the people of Israel , tell them , ‘ I am sent me to you. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	3	15	God also said to Moses , “ This is what you should tell the people : ‘ The Lord is the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . He sent me to you. ’ This will always be my name , by which people from now on will know me .

You should put those gifts on your children when you leave Egypt . In this way you will take with you the riches of the Egyptians. ” Footnotes - 3:14 I . . .

NCV	Exodus	4	4	but the Lord said to him , “ Reach out and grab the snake by its tail. ” When Moses reached out and took hold of the snake , it again became a stick in his hand .
NCV	Exodus	4	2	The Lord said to him , “ What is that in your hand ? ” Moses answered , “ It is my walking stick. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	3	The Lord said , “ Throw it on the ground. ” So Moses threw it on the ground , and it became a snake . Moses ran from the snake ,
NCV	Exodus	4	5	The Lord said , “ This is so that the Israelites will believe that the Lord appeared to you . I am the God of their ancestors , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	6	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Put your hand inside your coat. ” So Moses put his hand inside his coat . When he took it out , it was white with a skin disease .
NCV	Exodus	4	7	Then he said , “ Now put your hand inside your coat again. ” So Moses put his hand inside his coat again . When he took it out , his hand was healthy again , like the rest of his skin .
NCV	Exodus	4	8	Then the Lord said , “ If the people do not believe you or pay attention to the first miracle , they may believe you when you show them this second miracle .
NCV	Exodus	4	9	After these two miracles , if they still do not believe or listen to you , take some water from the Nile River and pour it on the dry ground . The water will become blood when it touches the ground. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	10	But Moses said to the Lord , “ Please , Lord , I have never been a skilled speaker . Even now , after talking to you , I can not speak well . I speak slowly and can ’ t find the best words. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	11	Then the Lord said to him , “ Who made a person ’ s mouth ? And who makes someone deaf or not able to speak ? Or who gives a person sight or blindness ? It is I , the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	4	12	Now go ! I will help you speak , and I will teach you what to say. ”

NCV	Exodus	4	15	You will speak to Aaron and tell him what to say . I will help both of you to speak and will teach you what to do .

NCV	Exodus	4	18	Moses went back to Jethro , his father-in-law , and said to him , “ Let me go back to my people in Egypt . I want to see if they are still alive. ” Jethro said to Moses , “ Go ! I wish you well. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	19	While Moses was still in Midian , the Lord said to him , “ Go back to Egypt , because the men who wanted to kill you are dead now. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	20	So Moses took his wife and his sons , put them on a donkey , and started back to Egypt . He took with him the walking stick of God .
NCV	Exodus	4	21	The Lord said to Moses , “ When you get back to Egypt , do all the miracles I have given you the power to do . Show them to the king of Egypt . But I will make the king very stubborn , and he will not let the people go .
NCV	Exodus	4	22	Then say to the king , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Israel is my firstborn son .
NCV	Exodus	4	23	I told you to let my son go so he may worship me . But you refused to let Israel go , so I will kill your firstborn son. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	4	24	As Moses was on his way to Egypt , he stopped at a resting place for the night . The Lord met him there and tried to kill him .
NCV	Exodus	4	25	But Zipporah took a flint knife and circumcised her son . Taking the skin , she touched Moses ’ feet with it and said to him , “ You are a bridegroom of blood to me. ”
NCV	Exodus	4	26	She said , “ You are a bridegroom of blood , ” because she had to circumcise her son . So the Lord let Moses alone .
NCV	Exodus	4	27	Meanwhile the Lord said to Aaron , “ Go out into the desert to meet Moses. ” When Aaron went , he met Moses at Sinai , the mountain of God , and kissed him .
NCV	Exodus	4	28	Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had said to him when he sent him to Egypt . He also told him about the miracles which the Lord had commanded him to do .

NCV	Exodus	5	3	Then Aaron and Moses said , “ The God of the Hebrews has met with us . Now let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God . If we don ’ t do this , he may kill us with a disease or in war. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	4	But the king said to them , “ Moses and Aaron , why are you taking the people away from their work ? Go back to your jobs !
NCV	Exodus	5	6	That same day the king gave a command to the slave masters and foremen .
NCV	Exodus	5	7	He said , “ Don ’ t give the people straw to make bricks as you used to do . Let them gather their own straw .
NCV	Exodus	5	8	But they must still make the same number of bricks as they did before . Do not accept fewer . They have become lazy , and that is why they are asking me , ‘ Let us go to offer sacrifices to our God. ’
NCV	Exodus	5	9	Make these people work harder and keep them busy ; then they will not have time to listen to the lies of Moses. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	10	So the slave masters and foremen went to the Israelites and said , “ This is what the king says : I will no longer give you straw .
NCV	Exodus	5	11	Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it . But you must make as many bricks as you made before. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	12	So the people went everywhere in Egypt looking for dry stalks to use for straw .
NCV	Exodus	5	13	The slave masters kept forcing the people to work harder . They said , “ You must make just as many bricks as you did when you were given straw. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	14	The king ’ s slave masters had made the Israelite foremen responsible for the work the people did . The Egyptian slave masters beat these men and asked them , “ Why aren ’ t you making as many bricks as you made in the past ? ”
NCV	Exodus	5	15	Then the Israelite foremen went to the king and complained , “ Why are you treating us , your servants , this way ?
NCV	Exodus	5	16	You give us no straw , but we are commanded to make bricks . Our slave masters beat us , but it is your own people ’ s fault. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	17	The king answered , “ You are lazy ! You don ’ t want to work ! That is why you ask to leave here and make sacrifices to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	5	18	Now , go back to work ! We will not give you any straw , but you must make just as many bricks as you did before. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	19	The Israelite foremen knew they were in trouble , because the king had told them , “ You must make just as many bricks each day as you did before. ”
NCV	Exodus	5	20	As they were leaving the meeting with the king , they met Moses and Aaron , who were waiting for them .

NCV	Exodus	5	22	Then Moses returned to the Lord and said , “ Lord , why have you brought this trouble on your people ? Is this why you sent me here ?

NCV	Exodus	7	19	The Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron : ‘ Take the walking stick in your hand and stretch your hand over the rivers , canals , ponds , and pools in Egypt. ’ The water will become blood everywhere in Egypt , both in wooden buckets and in stone jars. ”
NCV	Exodus	7	20	So Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded . In front of the king and his officers , Aaron raised his walking stick and struck the water in the Nile River . So all the water in the Nile changed into blood .
NCV	Exodus	7	21	The fish in the Nile died , and the river began to stink , so the Egyptians could not drink water from it . Blood was everywhere in the land of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	7	22	Using their tricks , the magicians of Egypt did the same thing . So the king was stubborn and refused to listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had said .
NCV	Exodus	7	23	The king turned and went into his palace and ignored what Moses and Aaron had done .
NCV	Exodus	7	24	The Egyptians could not drink the water from the Nile , so all of them dug along the bank of the river , looking for water to drink . The Frogs

NCV	Exodus	8	8	The king called for Moses and Aaron and said , “ Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people . I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	2	If you refuse , I will punish Egypt with frogs .
NCV	Exodus	8	3	The Nile River will be filled with frogs . They will come up into your palace , into your bedroom , on your bed , into the houses of your officers , and onto your people . They will come into your ovens and into your baking pans .
NCV	Exodus	8	4	The frogs will jump all over you , your people , and your officers. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	8	5	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron to hold his walking stick in his hand over the rivers , canals , and ponds . Make frogs come up out of the water onto the land of Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron held his hand over all the waters of Egypt , and the frogs came up out of the water and covered the land of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	8	7	The magicians used their tricks to do the same thing , so even more frogs came up onto the land of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	8	9	Moses said to the king , “ Please set the time when I should pray for you , your people , and your officers . Then the frogs will leave you and your houses and will remain only in the Nile. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	10	The king answered , “ Tomorrow. ” Moses said , “ What you want will happen . By this you will know that there is no one like the Lord our God .
NCV	Exodus	8	11	The frogs will leave you , your houses , your officers , and your people . They will remain only in the Nile. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	12	After Moses and Aaron left the king , Moses asked the Lord about the frogs he had sent to the king .
NCV	Exodus	8	13	And the Lord did as Moses asked . The frogs died in the houses , in the yards , and in the fields .
NCV	Exodus	8	14	The Egyptians put them in piles , and the whole country began to stink .
NCV	Exodus	8	15	But when the king saw that they were free of the frogs , he became stubborn again . He did not listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had said . The Gnats
NCV	Exodus	8	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron to raise his walking stick and strike the dust on the ground . Then everywhere in Egypt the dust will change into gnats. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	17	They did this , and when Aaron raised the walking stick that was in his hand and struck the dust on the ground , everywhere in Egypt the dust changed into gnats . The gnats got on the people and animals .
NCV	Exodus	8	18	Using their tricks , the magicians tried to do the same thing , but they could not make the dust change into gnats . The gnats remained on the people and animals .
NCV	Exodus	8	19	So the magicians told the king that the power of God had done this . But the king was stubborn and refused to listen to them , just as the Lord had said . The Flies
NCV	Exodus	8	20	The Lord told Moses , “ Get up early in the morning , and meet the king of Egypt as he goes out to the river . Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Let my people go so they can worship me .
NCV	Exodus	8	21	If you don ’ t let them go , I will send swarms of flies into your houses . The flies will be on you , your officers , and your people . The houses of Egypt will be full of flies , and they will be all over the ground , too .
NCV	Exodus	8	22	But I will not treat the Israelites the same as the Egyptian people . There will not be any flies in the land of Goshen , where my people live . By this you will know that I , the Lord , am in this land .
NCV	Exodus	8	23	I will treat my people differently from your people . This miracle will happen tomorrow. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	8	24	So the Lord did as he had said , and great swarms of flies came into the king ’ s palace and his officers ’ houses . All over Egypt flies were ruining the land .
NCV	Exodus	8	25	The king called for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ Offer sacrifices to your God here in this country. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	26	But Moses said , “ It wouldn ’ t be right to do that , because the Egyptians hate the sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God . If they see us offering sacrifices they hate , they will throw stones at us and kill us .
NCV	Exodus	8	27	Let us make a three-day journey into the desert . We must offer sacrifices to the Lord our God there , as the Lord told us to do. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	28	The king said , “ I will let you go so that you may offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the desert , but you must not go very far away . Now go and pray for me. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	29	Moses said , “ I will leave and pray to the Lord , and he will take the flies away from you , your officers , and your people tomorrow . But do not try to trick us again . Do not stop the people from going to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	8	30	So Moses left the king and prayed to the Lord ,
NCV	Exodus	8	31	and the Lord did as he asked . He removed the flies from the king , his officers , and his people so that not one fly was left .

NCV	Exodus	9	9	The ashes will spread like dust through all the land of Egypt . They will cause boils to break out and become sores on the skin of people and animals everywhere in the land. ”
NCV	Exodus	9	2	If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them ,
NCV	Exodus	9	3	the Lord will punish you . He will send a terrible disease on your farm animals that are in the fields . He will cause your horses , donkeys , camels , cattle , goats , and sheep to become sick .
NCV	Exodus	9	4	But the Lord will treat Israel ’ s animals differently from the animals of Egypt . None of the animals that belong to the Israelites will die .
NCV	Exodus	9	5	The Lord has set tomorrow as the time he will do this in the land. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	9	6	The next day the Lord did as he promised . All the farm animals in Egypt died , but none of the animals belonging to Israelites died .
NCV	Exodus	9	7	The king sent people to see what had happened to the animals of Israel , and they found that not one of them had died . But the king was still stubborn and did not let the people go . The Boils
NCV	Exodus	9	8	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Fill your hands with ashes from a furnace . Moses , throw the ashes into the air in front of the king of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	9	10	So Moses and Aaron took ashes from a furnace and went and stood before the king . Moses threw ashes into the air , which caused boils to break out and become sores on people and animals .
NCV	Exodus	9	11	The magicians could not stand before Moses , because all the Egyptians had boils , even the magicians .
NCV	Exodus	9	12	But the Lord made the king stubborn , so he refused to listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had said . The Hail
NCV	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Get up early in the morning and go to the king of Egypt . Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : Let my people go to worship me .
NCV	Exodus	9	14	If you don ’ t , this time I will punish you , your officers , and your people , with all my power . Then you will know there is no one in the whole land like me .
NCV	Exodus	9	15	By now I could have used my power and caused a terrible disease that would have destroyed you and your people from the earth .
NCV	Exodus	9	16	But I have let you live for this reason : to show you my power so that my name will be talked about in all the earth .
NCV	Exodus	9	17	You are still against my people and do not want to let them go .
NCV	Exodus	9	18	So at this time tomorrow , I will send a terrible hailstorm , the worst in Egypt since it became a nation .
NCV	Exodus	9	19	Now send for your animals and whatever you have in the fields , and bring them into a safe place . The hail will fall on every person or animal that is still in the fields . If they have not been brought in , they will die. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	9	20	Some of the king ’ s officers respected the word of the Lord and hurried to bring their slaves and animals inside .
NCV	Exodus	9	21	But others ignored the Lord ’ s message and left their slaves and animals in the fields .
NCV	Exodus	9	22	The Lord told Moses , “ Raise your hand toward the sky . Then the hail will start falling in all the land of Egypt . It will fall on people , animals , and on everything that grows in the fields of Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	9	23	When Moses raised his walking stick toward the sky , the Lord sent thunder and hail , and lightning flashed down to the earth . So he caused hail to fall upon the land of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	9	24	There was hail , and lightning flashed as it hailed—the worst hailstorm in Egypt since it had become a nation .
NCV	Exodus	9	25	The hail destroyed all the people and animals that were in the fields in all the land of Egypt . It also destroyed everything that grew in the fields and broke all the trees in the fields .
NCV	Exodus	9	26	The only place it did not hail was in the land of Goshen , where the Israelites lived .
NCV	Exodus	9	27	The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ This time I have sinned . The Lord is in the right , and I and my people are in the wrong .
NCV	Exodus	9	28	Pray to the Lord . We have had enough of God ’ s thunder and hail . I will let you go ; you do not have to stay here any longer. ”
NCV	Exodus	9	29	Moses told the king , “ When I leave the city , I will raise my hands to the Lord in prayer , and the thunder and hail will stop . Then you will know that the earth belongs to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	9	30	But I know that you and your officers do not yet fear the Lord God. ”
NCV	Exodus	9	31	The flax was in bloom , and the barley had ripened , so these crops were destroyed .
NCV	Exodus	9	32	But both wheat crops ripen later , so they were not destroyed .
NCV	Exodus	9	33	Moses left the king and went outside the city . He raised his hands to the Lord , and the thunder and hail stopped . The rain also stopped falling to the ground .
NCV	Exodus	9	34	When the king saw that the rain , hail , and thunder had stopped , he sinned again , and he and his officers became stubborn .

NCV	Exodus	10	10	The king said to them , “ The Lord will really have to be with you if ever I let you and all of your children leave Egypt . See , you are planning something evil !
NCV	Exodus	10	2	I also did this so you could tell your children and your grandchildren how I was hard on the Egyptians . Tell them about the miracles I did among them so that all of you will know that I am the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him , “ This is what the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says : ‘ How long will you refuse to be sorry for what you have done ? Let my people go to worship me .
NCV	Exodus	10	4	If you refuse to let my people go , tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country .
NCV	Exodus	10	5	They will cover the land so that no one will be able to see the ground . They will eat anything that was left from the hailstorm and the leaves from every tree growing in the field .
NCV	Exodus	10	6	They will fill your palaces and all your officers ’ houses , as well as the houses of all the Egyptians . There will be more locusts than your fathers or ancestors have ever seen—more than there have been since people began living in Egypt. ’ ” Then Moses turned and walked away from the king .
NCV	Exodus	10	7	The king ’ s officers asked him , “ How long will this man make trouble for us ? Let the Israelites go to worship the Lord their God . Don ’ t you know that Egypt is ruined ? ”
NCV	Exodus	10	8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to the king . He said to them , “ Go and worship the Lord your God . But tell me , just who is going ? ”
NCV	Exodus	10	9	Moses answered , “ We will go with our young and old people , our sons and daughters , and our flocks and herds , because we are going to have a feast to honor the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	11	No ! Only the men may go and worship the Lord , which is what you have been asking for. ” Then the king forced Moses and Aaron out of his palace .
NCV	Exodus	10	12	The Lord told Moses , “ Raise your hand over the land of Egypt , and the locusts will come . They will spread all over the land of Egypt and will eat all the plants the hail did not destroy. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	13	So Moses raised his walking stick over the land of Egypt , and the Lord caused a strong wind to blow from the east . It blew across the land all that day and night , and when morning came , the east wind had brought the locusts .
NCV	Exodus	10	14	Swarms of locusts covered all the land of Egypt and settled everywhere . There were more locusts than ever before or after ,
NCV	Exodus	10	15	and they covered the whole land so that it was black . They ate everything that was left after the hail—every plant in the field and all the fruit on the trees . Nothing green was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	10	16	The king quickly called for Moses and Aaron . He said , “ I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you .
NCV	Exodus	10	17	Now forgive my sin this time . Pray to the Lord your God , and ask him to stop this punishment that kills. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	18	Moses left the king and prayed to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	10	19	So the Lord changed the wind . He made a very strong wind blow from the west , and it blew the locusts away into the Red Sea . Not one locust was left anywhere in Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord caused the king to be stubborn again , and he did not let the Israelites go . The Darkness
NCV	Exodus	10	21	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Raise your hand toward the sky , and darkness will cover the land of Egypt . It will be so dark you will be able to feel it. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	22	Moses raised his hand toward the sky , and total darkness was everywhere in Egypt for three days .
NCV	Exodus	10	23	No one could see anyone else , and no one could go anywhere for three days . But the Israelites had light where they lived .
NCV	Exodus	10	24	Again the king of Egypt called for Moses . He said , “ All of you may go and worship the Lord . You may take your women and children with you , but you must leave your flocks and herds here. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	25	Moses said , “ You must let us have animals to use as sacrifices and burnt offerings , because we have to offer them to the Lord our God .
NCV	Exodus	10	26	So we must take our animals with us ; not a hoof will be left behind . We have to use some of the animals to worship the Lord our God . We won ’ t know exactly what we will need to worship the Lord until we get there. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord made the king stubborn again , so he refused to let them go .
NCV	Exodus	10	28	Then he told Moses , “ Get out of here , and don ’ t come again ! The next time you see me , you will die. ”
NCV	Exodus	10	29	Then Moses told the king , “ I ’ ll do what you say . I will not come to see you again. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	11	11	Now the Lord had told Moses , “ I have one more way to punish the king and the people of Egypt . After this , the king will send all of you away from Egypt . When he does , he will force you to leave completely .
NCV	Exodus	11	2	Tell the men and women of Israel to ask their neighbors for things made of silver and gold. ”
NCV	Exodus	11	3	The Lord had caused the Egyptians to respect the Israelites , and both the king ’ s officers and the Egyptian people considered Moses to be a great man .
NCV	Exodus	11	4	So Moses said to the king , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ About midnight tonight I will go through all Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	11	5	Every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die—from the firstborn son of the king , who sits on his throne , to the firstborn of the slave girl grinding grain . Also the firstborn farm animals will die .
NCV	Exodus	11	6	There will be loud outcries everywhere in Egypt , worse than any time before or after this .
NCV	Exodus	11	7	But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites or their animals. ’ Then you will know that the Lord treats Israel differently from Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	11	8	All your officers will come to me . They will bow facedown to the ground before me and say , ‘ Leave and take all your people with you. ’ After that , I will leave. ” Then Moses very angrily left the king .
NCV	Exodus	11	9	The Lord had told Moses , “ The king will not listen to you and Aaron so that I may do many miracles in the land of Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	11	10	Moses and Aaron did all these great miracles in front of the king . But the Lord made him stubborn , and the king would not let the Israelites leave his country . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	12	12	“ That night I will go through the land of Egypt and kill all the firstborn animals and people in the land of Egypt . I will also punish all the gods of Egypt . I am the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	12	2	“ This month will be the beginning of months , the first month of the year for you .
NCV	Exodus	12	3	Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man must get one lamb for the people in his house .
NCV	Exodus	12	4	If there are not enough people in his house to eat a whole lamb , he must share it with his closest neighbor , considering the number of people . There must be enough lamb for everyone to eat .
NCV	Exodus	12	5	The lamb must be a one-year-old male that has nothing wrong with it . This animal can be either a young sheep or a young goat .
NCV	Exodus	12	6	Take care of the animals until the fourteenth day of the month . On that day all the people of the community of Israel will kill them in the evening before dark .
NCV	Exodus	12	7	The people must take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs .
NCV	Exodus	12	8	On this night they must roast the lamb over a fire . They must eat it with bitter herbs and bread made without yeast .
NCV	Exodus	12	9	Do not eat the lamb raw or boiled in water . Roast the whole lamb over a fire—with its head , legs , and inner organs .
NCV	Exodus	12	10	You must not leave any of it until morning , but if any of it is left over until morning , you must burn it with fire .
NCV	Exodus	12	11	“ This is the way you must eat it : You must be fully dressed as if you were going on a trip . You must have your sandals on and your walking stick in your hand . You must eat it in a hurry ; this is the Lord ’ s Passover .
NCV	Exodus	12	13	But the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are . When I see the blood , I will pass over you . Nothing terrible will hurt you when I punish the land of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	12	14	“ You are always to remember this day and celebrate it with a feast to the Lord . Your descendants are to honor the Lord with this feast from now on .
NCV	Exodus	12	15	For this feast you must eat bread made without yeast for seven days . On the first day , you are to remove all the yeast from your houses . No one should eat any yeast for the full seven days of the feast , or that person will be cut off from Israel .
NCV	Exodus	12	16	You are to have holy meetings on the first and last days of the feast . You must not do any work on these days ; the only work you may do is to prepare your meals .
NCV	Exodus	12	17	You must celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread , because on this very day I brought your divisions of people out of Egypt . So all of your descendants must celebrate this day . This is a law that will last from now on .
NCV	Exodus	12	18	In the first month of the year you are to eat bread made without yeast , from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day .
NCV	Exodus	12	19	For seven days there must not be any yeast in your houses . Anybody who eats yeast during this time , either an Israelite or non-Israelite , must be cut off from the community of Israel .
NCV	Exodus	12	20	During this feast you must not eat anything made with yeast . You must eat only bread made without yeast wherever you live. ”
NCV	Exodus	12	21	Then Moses called all the elders of Israel together and told them , “ Get the animals for your families and kill the lamb for the Passover .
NCV	Exodus	12	22	Take a branch of the hyssop plant , dip it into the bowl filled with blood , and then wipe the blood on the sides and tops of the doorframes . No one may leave that house until morning .
NCV	Exodus	12	23	When the Lord goes through Egypt to kill the Egyptians , he will see the blood on the sides and tops of the doorframes , and he will pass over that house . He will not let the one who brings death come into your houses and kill you .
NCV	Exodus	12	24	“ You must keep this command as a law for you and your descendants from now on .
NCV	Exodus	12	25	Do this when you go to the land the Lord has promised to give you .
NCV	Exodus	12	26	When your children ask you , ‘ Why are we doing these things ? ’
NCV	Exodus	12	27	you will say , ‘ This is the Passover sacrifice to honor the Lord . When we were in Egypt , the Lord passed over the houses of Israel , and when he killed the Egyptians , he saved our homes. ’ ” Then the people bowed down and worshiped the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	12	28	They did just as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron .
NCV	Exodus	12	29	At midnight the Lord killed all the firstborn sons in the land of Egypt—from the firstborn of the king who sat on the throne to the firstborn of the prisoner in jail . Also , all the firstborn farm animals died .
NCV	Exodus	12	30	The king , his officers , and all the Egyptians got up during the night because someone had died in every house . So there was a loud outcry everywhere in Egypt . Israel Leaves Egypt
NCV	Exodus	12	31	During the night the king called for Moses and Aaron and said , “ Get up and leave my people . You and your people may do as you have asked ; go and worship the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	12	32	Take all of your flocks and herds as you have asked , and go . And also bless me. ”
NCV	Exodus	12	33	The Egyptians also asked the Israelites to hurry and leave , saying , “ If you don ’ t leave , we will all die ! ”
NCV	Exodus	12	34	So the people took their dough before the yeast was added . They wrapped the bowls for making dough in clothing and carried them on their shoulders .
NCV	Exodus	12	35	The Israelites did what Moses told them to do and asked their Egyptian neighbors for things made of silver and gold and for clothing .
NCV	Exodus	12	36	The Lord caused the Egyptians to think well of them , and the Egyptians gave the people everything they asked for . So the Israelites took rich gifts from them .
NCV	Exodus	12	37	The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth . There were about six hundred thousand men walking , not including the women and children .
NCV	Exodus	12	38	Many other people who were not Israelites went with them , as well as a large number of sheep , goats , and cattle .
NCV	Exodus	12	39	The Israelites used the dough they had brought out of Egypt to bake loaves of bread without yeast . The dough had no yeast in it , because they had been rushed out of Egypt and had no time to get food ready for their trip .
NCV	Exodus	12	40	The people of Israel had lived in Egypt for four hundred thirty years ;
NCV	Exodus	12	41	on the very day the four hundred thirty years ended , the Lord ’ s divisions of people left Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	12	42	That night the Lord kept watch to bring them out of Egypt , and so on this same night the Israelites are to keep watch to honor the Lord from now on .
NCV	Exodus	12	43	The Lord told Moses and Aaron , “ Here are the rules for Passover : No foreigner is to eat the Passover .
NCV	Exodus	12	44	If someone buys a slave and circumcises him , the slave may eat the Passover .
NCV	Exodus	12	45	But neither a person who lives for a short time in your country nor a hired worker may eat it .
NCV	Exodus	12	46	“ The meal must be eaten inside a house ; take none of the meat outside the house . Don ’ t break any of the bones .
NCV	Exodus	12	47	The whole community of Israel must take part in this feast .
NCV	Exodus	12	48	A foreigner who lives with you may share in the Lord ’ s Passover if all the males in his house become circumcised . Then , since he will be like a citizen of Israel , he may share in the meal . But a man who is not circumcised may not eat the Passover meal .
NCV	Exodus	12	49	The same rules apply to an Israelite born in the country or to a foreigner living there. ”
NCV	Exodus	12	50	So all the Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron .

NCV	Exodus	13	13	Buy back every firstborn donkey by offering a lamb . But if you don ’ t want to buy the donkey back , then break its neck . You must buy back from the Lord every firstborn of your sons .
NCV	Exodus	13	2	“ Give every firstborn male to me . Every firstborn male among the Israelites belongs to me , whether human or animal. ”
NCV	Exodus	13	3	Moses said to the people , “ Remember this day , the day you left Egypt . You were slaves in that land , but the Lord with his great power brought you out of it . You must not eat bread made with yeast .
NCV	Exodus	13	4	Today , in the month of Abib , you are leaving Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	13	5	The Lord will lead you to the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Hivites , and Jebusites . This is the land he promised your ancestors he would give you , a fertile land . There you must celebrate this feast during the first month of every year .
NCV	Exodus	13	6	For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast , and on the seventh day there will be a feast to honor the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	13	7	So for seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast . There must be no bread made with yeast anywhere in your land .
NCV	Exodus	13	8	On that day you should tell your son : ‘ We are having this feast because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt. ’
NCV	Exodus	13	9	This feast will help you remember , like a mark on your hand or a reminder on your forehead . This feast will remind you to speak the Lord ’ s teachings , because the Lord used his great power to bring you out of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	13	10	So celebrate this feast every year at the right time .
NCV	Exodus	13	11	“ And when the Lord takes you into the land of the Canaanites , the land he promised to give you and your ancestors ,
NCV	Exodus	13	12	you must give him every firstborn male . Also every firstborn male animal must be given to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	13	14	“ From now on when your son asks you , ‘ What does this mean ? ’ you will answer , ‘ With his great power , the Lord brought us out from Egypt , the land where we were slaves .
NCV	Exodus	13	15	The king of Egypt was stubborn and refused to let us leave . But the Lord killed every firstborn male in Egypt , both human and animal . That is why I sacrifice every firstborn male animal to the Lord , and that is why I buy back each of my firstborn sons from the Lord. ’
NCV	Exodus	13	16	This feast is like a mark on your hand and a reminder on your forehead to help you remember that the Lord brought us out of Egypt with his great power. ” The Way Out of Egypt
NCV	Exodus	13	17	When the king sent the people out of Egypt , God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country , though that was the shortest way . God said , “ If they have to fight , they might change their minds and go back to Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	13	18	So God led them through the desert toward the Red Sea . The Israelites were dressed for fighting when they left the land of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	13	19	Moses carried the bones of Joseph with him , because before Joseph died , he had made the Israelites promise to do this . He had said , “ When God saves you , remember to carry my bones with you out of Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	13	20	The Israelites left Succoth and camped at Etham , on the edge of the desert .
NCV	Exodus	13	21	The Lord showed them the way ; during the day he went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud , and during the night he was in a pillar of fire to give them light . In this way they could travel during the day or night .

NCV	Exodus	14	14	You only need to remain calm ; the Lord will fight for you. ”
NCV	Exodus	14	2	“ Tell the Israelites to turn back to Pi Hahiroth and to camp between Migdol and the Red Sea . Camp across from Baal Zephon , on the shore of the sea .
NCV	Exodus	14	3	The king will think , ‘ The Israelites are lost , trapped by the desert. ’
NCV	Exodus	14	4	I will make the king stubborn again so he will chase after them , but I will defeat the king and his army . This will bring honor to me , and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. ” The Israelites did just as they were told . The King Chases the Israelites
NCV	Exodus	14	5	When the king of Egypt was told that the Israelites had left , he and his officers changed their minds about them . They said , “ What have we done ? We have let the Israelites leave . We have lost our slaves ! ”
NCV	Exodus	14	6	So the king prepared his war chariot and took his army with him .
NCV	Exodus	14	7	He took six hundred of his best chariots , together with all the other chariots of Egypt , each with an officer in it .
NCV	Exodus	14	8	The Lord made the king of Egypt stubborn , so he chased the Israelites , who were leaving victoriously .
NCV	Exodus	14	9	The Egyptians—with all the king ’ s horses , chariot drivers , and army—chased the Israelites . They caught up with them while they were camped by the Red Sea , near Pi Hahiroth and Baal Zephon .
NCV	Exodus	14	10	When the Israelites saw the king and his army coming after them , they were very frightened and cried to the Lord for help .
NCV	Exodus	14	11	They said to Moses , “ What have you done to us ? Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert ? There were plenty of graves for us in Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	14	12	We told you in Egypt , ‘ Let us alone ; we will stay and serve the Egyptians. ’ Now we will die in the desert. ”
NCV	Exodus	14	13	But Moses answered , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Stand still and you will see the Lord save you today . You will never see these Egyptians again after today .
NCV	Exodus	14	15	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Why are you crying out to me ? Command the Israelites to start moving .
NCV	Exodus	14	16	Raise your walking stick and hold it over the sea so that the sea will split and the people can cross it on dry land .
NCV	Exodus	14	17	I will make the Egyptians stubborn so they will chase the Israelites , but I will be honored when I defeat the king and all of his chariot drivers and chariots .
NCV	Exodus	14	18	When I defeat the king , his chariot drivers , and chariots , the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	14	19	Now the angel of God that usually traveled in front of Israel ’ s army moved behind them . Also , the pillar of cloud moved from in front of the people and stood behind them .
NCV	Exodus	14	20	So the cloud came between the Egyptians and the Israelites . This made it dark for the Egyptians but gave light to the Israelites . So the cloud kept the two armies apart all night .
NCV	Exodus	14	21	Then Moses held his hand over the sea . All that night the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind , making the sea become dry ground . The water was split ,
NCV	Exodus	14	22	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry land , with a wall of water on their right and on their left .
NCV	Exodus	14	23	Then all the king ’ s horses , chariots , and chariot drivers followed them into the sea .
NCV	Exodus	14	24	When morning came , the Lord looked down from the pillar of cloud and fire at the Egyptian army and made them panic .
NCV	Exodus	14	25	He kept the wheels of the chariots from turning , making it hard to drive the chariots . The Egyptians shouted , “ Let ’ s get away from the Israelites ! The Lord is fighting for them and against Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	14	26	Then the Lord told Moses , “ Hold your hand over the sea so that the water will come back over the Egyptians , their chariots , and chariot drivers. ”
NCV	Exodus	14	27	So Moses raised his hand over the sea , and at dawn the sea returned to its place . The Egyptians tried to run from it , but the Lord swept them away into the sea .
NCV	Exodus	14	28	The water returned , covering the chariots , chariot drivers , and all the king ’ s army that had followed the Israelites into the sea . Not one of them survived .
NCV	Exodus	14	29	But the Israelites crossed the sea on dry land , with a wall of water on their right and on their left .
NCV	Exodus	14	30	So that day the Lord saved the Israelites from the Egyptians , and the Israelites saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore .
NCV	Exodus	14	31	When the Israelites saw the great power the Lord had used against the Egyptians , they feared the Lord , and they trusted him and his servant Moses . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	15	15	The leaders of the tribes of Edom will be very frightened ; the powerful men of Moab will shake with fear ; the people of Canaan will lose all their courage .
NCV	Exodus	15	2	The Lord gives me strength and makes me sing ; he has saved me . He is my God , and I will praise him . He is the God of my ancestors , and I will honor him .
NCV	Exodus	15	3	The Lord is a warrior ; the Lord is his name .
NCV	Exodus	15	4	The chariots and soldiers of the king of Egypt he has thrown into the sea . The king ’ s best officers are drowned in the Red Sea .
NCV	Exodus	15	5	The deep waters covered them , and they sank to the bottom like a rock .
NCV	Exodus	15	6	Your right hand , Lord , is amazingly strong . Lord , your right hand broke the enemy to pieces .
NCV	Exodus	15	7	In your great victory you destroyed those who were against you . Your anger destroyed them , like fire burning straw .
NCV	Exodus	15	8	Just a blast of your breath , and the waters piled up . The moving water stood like a wall ; the deep waters became solid in the middle of the sea .
NCV	Exodus	15	9	“ The enemy bragged , ‘ I ’ ll chase them and catch them . I ’ ll take all their riches ; I ’ ll take all I want . I ’ ll pull out my sword , and my hand will destroy them. ’
NCV	Exodus	15	10	But you blew on them with your breath and covered them with the sea . They sank like lead in the raging water .
NCV	Exodus	15	11	“ Are there any gods like you , Lord ? There are no gods like you . You are wonderfully holy , amazingly powerful , a worker of miracles .
NCV	Exodus	15	12	You reached out with your right hand , and the earth swallowed our enemies .
NCV	Exodus	15	13	You keep your loving promise and lead the people you have saved . With your strength you will guide them to your holy place .
NCV	Exodus	15	14	“ The other nations will hear this and tremble with fear ; terror will take hold of the Philistines .
NCV	Exodus	15	16	Terror and horror will fall on them . When they see your strength , they will be as still as a rock . They will be still until your people pass by , Lord . They will be still until the people you have taken as your own pass by .
NCV	Exodus	15	17	You will lead your people and place them on your very own mountain , the place that you , Lord , made for yourself to live , the temple , Lord , that your hands have made .
NCV	Exodus	15	18	The Lord will be king forever ! ”
NCV	Exodus	15	19	The horses , chariot drivers , and chariots of the king of Egypt went into the sea , and the Lord covered them with water from the sea . But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry land .
NCV	Exodus	15	20	Then Aaron ’ s sister Miriam , a prophetess , took a tambourine in her hand . All the women followed her , playing tambourines and dancing .
NCV	Exodus	15	21	Miriam told them : “ Sing to the Lord , because he is worthy of great honor ; he has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea. ” Bitter Water Becomes Good
NCV	Exodus	15	22	Moses led the Israelites away from the Red Sea into the Desert of Shur . They traveled for three days in the desert but found no water .
NCV	Exodus	15	23	Then they came to Marah , where there was water , but they could not drink it because it was too bitter . ( That is why the place was named Marah . [ a ] )
NCV	Exodus	15	24	The people grumbled to Moses and asked , “ What will we drink ? ”
NCV	Exodus	15	25	So Moses cried out to the Lord , and the Lord showed him a tree . When Moses threw the tree into the water , the water became good to drink . There the Lord gave the people a rule and a law to live by , and there he tested their loyalty to him .
NCV	Exodus	15	26	He said , “ You must obey the Lord your God and do what he says is right . If you obey all his commands and keep his rules , I will not bring on you any of the sicknesses I brought on the Egyptians . I am the Lord who heals you. ”
NCV	Exodus	15	27	Then the people traveled to Elim , where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees . So the people camped there near the water . Footnotes - 15:23 Marah This name means “ bitter. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	16	16	The Lord has commanded , ‘ Each one of you must gather what he needs , about two quarts for every person in your family. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	16	2	Then the whole Israelite community grumbled to Moses and Aaron in the desert .
NCV	Exodus	16	3	They said to them , “ It would have been better if the Lord had killed us in the land of Egypt . There we had meat to eat and all the food we wanted . But you have brought us into this desert to starve us to death. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I will cause food to fall like rain from the sky for all of you . Every day the people must go out and gather what they need for that day . I want to see if the people will do what I teach them .
NCV	Exodus	16	5	On the sixth day of each week , they are to gather twice as much as they gather on other days . Then they are to prepare it. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites : “ This evening you will know that the Lord is the one who brought you out of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	16	7	Tomorrow morning you will see the glory of the Lord , because he has heard you grumble against him . We are nothing , so you are not grumbling against us , but against the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	8	And Moses said , “ Each evening the Lord will give you meat to eat , and every morning he will give you all the bread you want , because he has heard you grumble against him . You are not grumbling against Aaron and me , because we are nothing ; you are grumbling against the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	9	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Speak to the whole community of the Israelites , and say to them , ‘ Meet together in the presence of the Lord , because he has heard your grumblings. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	16	10	While Aaron was speaking to the whole community of the Israelites , they looked toward the desert . There the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud .
NCV	Exodus	16	11	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Exodus	16	12	“ I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel . So tell them , ‘ At twilight you will eat meat , and every morning you will eat all the bread you want . Then you will know I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	16	13	That evening quail came and covered the camp , and in the morning dew lay around the camp .
NCV	Exodus	16	14	When the dew was gone , thin flakes like frost were on the desert ground .
NCV	Exodus	16	15	When the Israelites saw it , they asked each other , “ What is it ? ” because they did not know what it was . So Moses told them , “ This is the bread the Lord has given you to eat .
NCV	Exodus	16	17	So the people of Israel did this ; some people gathered much , and some gathered little .
NCV	Exodus	16	18	Then they measured it . The person who gathered more did not have too much , nor did the person who gathered less have too little . Each person gathered just as much as he needed .
NCV	Exodus	16	19	Moses said to them , “ Don ’ t keep any of it to eat the next day. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	20	But some of the people did not listen to Moses and kept part of it to eat the next morning . It became full of worms and began to stink , so Moses was angry with those people .
NCV	Exodus	16	21	Every morning each person gathered as much food as he needed , but when the sun became hot , it melted away .
NCV	Exodus	16	22	On the sixth day the people gathered twice as much food—four quarts for every person . When all the leaders of the community came and told this to Moses ,
NCV	Exodus	16	23	he said to them , “ This is what the Lord commanded , because tomorrow is the Sabbath , the Lord ’ s holy day of rest . Bake what you want to bake , and boil what you want to boil today . Save the rest of the food until tomorrow morning. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	24	So the people saved it until the next morning , as Moses had commanded , and none of it began to stink or have worms in it .
NCV	Exodus	16	25	Moses told the people , “ Eat the food you gathered yesterday . Today is a Sabbath , the Lord ’ s day of rest ; you will not find any out in the field today .
NCV	Exodus	16	26	You should gather the food for six days , but the seventh day is a Sabbath day . On that day there will not be any food on the ground. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	27	On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather food , but they couldn ’ t find any .
NCV	Exodus	16	28	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ How long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings ?
NCV	Exodus	16	29	Look , the Lord has made the Sabbath a day of rest for you . So on the sixth day he will give you enough food for two days , but on the seventh day each of you must stay where you are . Do not go anywhere. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
NCV	Exodus	16	31	The people of Israel called the food manna . It was like small white seeds and tasted like wafers made with honey .
NCV	Exodus	16	32	Then Moses said , “ The Lord said , ‘ Save two quarts of this food for your descendants . Then they can see the food I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	16	33	Moses told Aaron , “ Take a jar and fill it with two quarts of manna . Then place it before the Lord , and save it for your descendants. ”
NCV	Exodus	16	34	So Aaron did what the Lord had commanded Moses . He put the jar of manna in front of the Agreement to keep it safe .
NCV	Exodus	16	35	The Israelites ate manna for forty years , until they came to the land where they settled—the edge of the land of Canaan .
NCV	Exodus	16	36	The measure they used for the manna was two quarts , or one-tenth of an ephah . [ a ] Footnotes - 16:36 ephah An ephah was a measure that equaled twenty quarts . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	17	17	The whole Israelite community left the Desert of Sin and traveled from place to place , as the Lord commanded . They camped at Rephidim , but there was no water there for the people to drink .
NCV	Exodus	17	2	So they quarreled with Moses and said , “ Give us water to drink. ” Moses said to them , “ Why do you quarrel with me ? Why are you testing the Lord ? ”
NCV	Exodus	17	3	But the people were very thirsty for water , so they grumbled against Moses . They said , “ Why did you bring us out of Egypt ? Was it to kill us , our children , and our farm animals with thirst ? ”
NCV	Exodus	17	4	So Moses cried to the Lord , “ What can I do with these people ? They are almost ready to stone me to death. ”
NCV	Exodus	17	5	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go ahead of the people , and take some of the elders of Israel with you . Carry with you the walking stick that you used to strike the Nile River . Now go !
NCV	Exodus	17	6	I will stand in front of you on a rock at Mount Sinai . Hit that rock with the stick , and water will come out of it so that the people can drink. ” Moses did these things as the elders of Israel watched .
NCV	Exodus	17	7	He named that place Massah , [ a ] because the Israelites tested the Lord when they asked , “ Is the Lord with us or not ? ” He also named it Meribah , [ b ] because they quarreled . The Amalekites Fight Israel
NCV	Exodus	17	8	At Rephidim the Amalekites came and fought the Israelites .
NCV	Exodus	17	9	So Moses said to Joshua , “ Choose some men and go and fight the Amalekites . Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill , holding the walking stick of God in my hands. ”
NCV	Exodus	17	10	Joshua obeyed Moses and went to fight the Amalekites , while Moses , Aaron , and Hur went to the top of the hill .
NCV	Exodus	17	11	As long as Moses held his hands up , the Israelites would win the fight , but when Moses put his hands down , the Amalekites would win .
NCV	Exodus	17	12	Later , when Moses ’ arms became tired , the men put a large rock under him , and he sat on it . Then Aaron and Hur held up Moses ’ hands—Aaron on one side and Hur on the other . They kept his hands steady until the sun went down .
NCV	Exodus	17	13	So Joshua defeated the Amalekites in this battle .
NCV	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write about this battle in a book so people will remember . And be sure to tell Joshua , because I will completely destroy the Amalekites from the earth. ”
NCV	Exodus	17	15	Then Moses built an altar and named it The Lord Is My Banner .

NCV	Exodus	18	18	You and the people who come to you will get too tired . This is too much work for you ; you can ’ t do it by yourself .
NCV	Exodus	18	2	Now Moses had sent his wife Zipporah to Jethro , his father-in-law ,
NCV	Exodus	18	3	along with his two sons . The first son was named Gershom , [ a ] because when he was born , Moses said , “ I am a stranger in a foreign country. ”
NCV	Exodus	18	4	The other son was named Eliezer , [ b ] because when he was born , Moses said , “ The God of my father is my help . He saved me from the king of Egypt. ”
NCV	Exodus	18	5	So Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , took Moses ’ wife and his two sons and went to Moses . He was camped in the desert near the mountain of God .
NCV	Exodus	18	6	Jethro had sent a message ahead to Moses that said , “ I , Jethro , your father-in-law , am coming to you with your wife and her two sons. ”
NCV	Exodus	18	7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him . After the two men asked about each other ’ s health , they went into Moses ’ tent .
NCV	Exodus	18	8	Moses told his father-in-law everything the Lord had done to the king and the Egyptians to help Israel . He told about all the problems they had faced along the way and how the Lord had saved them .
NCV	Exodus	18	9	Jethro was very happy to hear all the good things the Lord had done for Israel when he had saved them from the Egyptians .
NCV	Exodus	18	10	He said , “ Praise the Lord . He has saved you from the Egyptians and their king , and he has saved the people from the power of the Egyptians .
NCV	Exodus	18	11	Now I know the Lord is greater than all gods , because he did this to those who looked down on Israel. ”
NCV	Exodus	18	12	Then Jethro , Moses ’ father-in-law , gave a whole burnt offering and other sacrifices to God . Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to Moses ’ father-in-law to eat the holy meal together before God .
NCV	Exodus	18	13	The next day Moses solved disagreements among the people , and the people stood around him from morning until night .
NCV	Exodus	18	14	When Moses ’ father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people , he asked , “ What is all this you are doing for the people ? Why are you the only one to solve disagreements ? All the people are standing around you from morning until night ! ”
NCV	Exodus	18	15	Then Moses said to his father-in-law , “ It is because the people come to me for God ’ s help in solving their disagreements .
NCV	Exodus	18	16	When people have a disagreement , they come to me , and I decide who is right . I tell them God ’ s laws and teachings. ”
NCV	Exodus	18	17	Moses ’ father-in-law said to him , “ You are not doing this right .
NCV	Exodus	18	19	Now listen to me , and I will give you some advice . I want God to be with you . You must speak to God for the people and tell him about their disagreements .
NCV	Exodus	18	20	Warn them about the laws and teachings , and teach them the right way to live and what they should do .
NCV	Exodus	18	21	But choose some capable men from among the people—men who respect God , who can be trusted , and who will not change their decisions for money . Make these men officers over the people , to rule over groups of thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens .
NCV	Exodus	18	22	Let these officers solve the disagreements among the people all the time . They can bring the hard cases to you , but they can decide the simple cases themselves . That will make it easier for you , because they will share the work with you .
NCV	Exodus	18	23	If you do this as God commands you , then you will be able to do your job , and all the people will go home with their disagreements solved. ”
NCV	Exodus	18	24	So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said .
NCV	Exodus	18	25	He chose capable men from all the Israelites and made them leaders over the people ; they were officers over groups of thousands , hundreds , fifties , and tens .
NCV	Exodus	18	26	These officers solved disagreements among the people all the time . They brought the hard cases to Moses , but they decided the simple cases themselves .

NCV	Exodus	19	19	The sound from the trumpet became louder . Then Moses spoke , and the voice of God answered him .
NCV	Exodus	19	2	When they left Rephidim , they came to the Desert of Sinai and camped in the desert in front of the mountain .
NCV	Exodus	19	3	Then Moses went up on the mountain to God . The Lord called to him from the mountain and said , “ Say this to the family of Jacob , and tell the people of Israel :
NCV	Exodus	19	4	‘ Every one of you has seen what I did to the people of Egypt . You saw how I carried you out of Egypt , as if on eagle ’ s wings . And I brought you here to me .
NCV	Exodus	19	5	So now if you obey me and keep my agreement , you will be my own possession , chosen from all nations . Even though the whole earth is mine ,
NCV	Exodus	19	6	you will be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation. ’ You must tell the Israelites these words. ”
NCV	Exodus	19	7	So Moses went down and called the elders of the people together . He told them all the words the Lord had commanded him to say .
NCV	Exodus	19	8	All the people answered together , “ We will do everything he has said. ” Then Moses took their answer back to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	19	9	And the Lord said to Moses , “ I will come to you in a thick cloud and speak to you . The people will hear me speaking with you and will always trust you. ” Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said .
NCV	Exodus	19	10	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go to the people and have them spend today and tomorrow preparing themselves . They must wash their clothes
NCV	Exodus	19	11	and be ready by the day after tomorrow . On that day I , the Lord , will come down on Mount Sinai , and all the people will see me .
NCV	Exodus	19	12	But you must set a limit around the mountain that the people are not to cross . Tell them not to go up on the mountain and not to touch the foot of it . Anyone who touches the mountain must be put to death
NCV	Exodus	19	13	with stones or shot with arrows . No one is allowed to touch him . Whether it is a person or an animal , he will not live . But the trumpet will make a long blast , and only then may the people go up on the mountain. ”
NCV	Exodus	19	14	After Moses went down from the mountain to the people , he made them prepare themselves for service to God , and they washed their clothes .
NCV	Exodus	19	15	Then Moses said to the people , “ Be ready in three days . Do not have sexual relations during this time. ”
NCV	Exodus	19	16	On the morning of the third day , there was thunder and lightning with a thick cloud on the mountain . There was a very loud blast from a trumpet , and all the people in the camp trembled .
NCV	Exodus	19	17	Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God , and they stood at the foot of the mountain .
NCV	Exodus	19	18	Mount Sinai was covered with smoke , because the Lord came down on it in fire . The smoke rose from the mountain like smoke from a furnace , and the whole mountain shook wildly .
NCV	Exodus	19	20	When the Lord came down on top of Mount Sinai , he called Moses to come up to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
NCV	Exodus	19	21	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go down and warn the people that they must not force their way through to see me . If they do , many of them will die .
NCV	Exodus	19	22	Even the priests , who may come near me , must first prepare themselves . If they don ’ t , I , the Lord , will punish them. ”
NCV	Exodus	19	23	Moses told the Lord , “ The people can not come up on Mount Sinai , because you yourself told us , ‘ Set a limit around the mountain , and set it apart as holy. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	19	24	The Lord said to him , “ Go down and bring Aaron up with you , but don ’ t allow the priests or the people to force their way through . They must not come up to the Lord , or I will punish them. ”

NCV	Exodus	32	32	Now , please forgive them of this sin . If you will not , then erase my name from the book in which you have written the names of your people. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	2	Aaron said to the people , “ Take off the gold earrings that your wives , sons , and daughters are wearing , and bring them to me. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	3	So all the people took their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron .
NCV	Exodus	32	4	He took the gold from the people and formed it with a tool and made a statue of a calf . Then the people said , “ Israel , these are your gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt ! ”
NCV	Exodus	32	5	When Aaron saw all this , he built an altar before the calf and announced , “ Tomorrow there will be a special feast to honor the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	6	The people got up early the next morning and offered whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . They sat down to eat and drink , and then they got up and sinned sexually .
NCV	Exodus	32	7	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Go down from this mountain , because your people , the people you brought out of the land of Egypt , have ruined themselves .
NCV	Exodus	32	8	They have quickly turned away from the things I commanded them to do . They have made for themselves a calf covered with gold , and they have worshiped it and offered sacrifices to it . They have said , ‘ Israel , these are your gods who brought you out of Egypt. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	32	9	The Lord said to Moses , “ I have seen these people , and I know that they are very stubborn .
NCV	Exodus	32	10	So now do not stop me . I am so angry with them that I am going to destroy them . Then I will make you and your descendants a great nation. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	11	But Moses begged the Lord his God and said , “ Lord , don ’ t let your anger destroy your people , whom you brought out of Egypt with your great power and strength .
NCV	Exodus	32	12	Don ’ t let the people of Egypt say , ‘ The Lord brought the Israelites out of Egypt for an evil purpose . He planned to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the earth. ’ So stop being angry , and don ’ t destroy your people .
NCV	Exodus	32	13	Remember the men who served you—Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . You promised with an oath to them and said , ‘ I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky . I will give your descendants all this land that I have promised them , and it will be theirs forever. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	32	14	So the Lord changed his mind and did not destroy the people as he had said he might .
NCV	Exodus	32	15	Then Moses went down the mountain , and in his hands he had the two stone tablets with the Agreement on them . The commands were written on both sides of each stone , front and back .
NCV	Exodus	32	16	God himself had made the tablets , and God himself had written the commands on the tablets .
NCV	Exodus	32	17	When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting , he said to Moses , “ It sounds like war down in the camp. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	18	Moses answered : “ It is not a shout of victory ; it is not a cry of defeat . It is the sound of singing that I hear. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	19	When Moses came close to the camp , he saw the gold calf and the dancing , and he became very angry . He threw down the stone tablets that he was carrying and broke them at the bottom of the mountain .
NCV	Exodus	32	20	Then he took the calf that the people had made and melted it in the fire . He ground it into powder . Then he threw the powder into the water and forced the Israelites to drink it .
NCV	Exodus	32	21	Moses said to Aaron , “ What did these people do to you ? Why did you cause them to do such a terrible sin ? ”
NCV	Exodus	32	22	Aaron answered , “ Don ’ t be angry , master . You know that these people are always ready to do wrong .
NCV	Exodus	32	23	The people said to me , ‘ Moses led us out of Egypt , but we don ’ t know what has happened to him . Make us gods who will lead us. ’
NCV	Exodus	32	24	So I told the people , ‘ Take off your gold jewelry. ’ When they gave me the gold , I threw it into the fire and out came this calf ! ”
NCV	Exodus	32	25	Moses saw that the people were acting wildly . Aaron had let them get out of control and become fools in front of their enemies .
NCV	Exodus	32	26	So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said , “ Let anyone who wants to follow the Lord come to me. ” And all the people from the family of Levi gathered around Moses .
NCV	Exodus	32	27	Then Moses said to them , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , says this : ‘ Every man must put on his sword and go through the camp from one end to the other . Each man must kill his brother , his friend , and his neighbor. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	32	28	The people from the family of Levi obeyed Moses , and that day about three thousand of the Israelites died .
NCV	Exodus	32	29	Then Moses said , “ Today you have been given for service to the Lord . You were willing to kill your own sons and brothers , and God has blessed you for this. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	30	The next day Moses told the people , “ You have done a terrible sin . But now I will go up to the Lord . Maybe I can do something so your sins will be removed. ”
NCV	Exodus	32	31	So Moses went back to the Lord and said , “ How terribly these people have sinned ! They have made for themselves gods from gold .
NCV	Exodus	32	33	But the Lord told Moses , “ I will erase from my book the names of the people who sin against me .
NCV	Exodus	32	34	So now , go . Lead the people where I have told you , and my angel will lead you . When the time comes to punish , I will punish them for their sin. ”

NCV	Exodus	33	33	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ You and the people you brought out of Egypt must leave this place . Go to the land that I promised with an oath to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob when I said , ‘ I will give that land to your descendants. ’
NCV	Exodus	33	2	I will send an angel to lead you , and I will force these people out of the land : the Canaanites , Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
NCV	Exodus	33	3	Go up to a fertile land . But I will not go with you , because I might destroy you on the way , since you are such a stubborn people. ”
NCV	Exodus	33	4	When the people heard this bad news , they became very sad , and none of them put on jewelry .
NCV	Exodus	33	5	This was because the Lord had said to Moses , “ Tell the Israelites , ‘ You are a stubborn people . If I were to go with you even for a moment , I would destroy you . So take off all your jewelry , and I will decide what to do with you. ’ ”
NCV	Exodus	33	6	So the people of Israel took off their jewelry at Mount Sinai . The Meeting Tent
NCV	Exodus	33	7	Moses used to take a tent and set it up a long way outside the camp ; he called it the “ Meeting Tent. ” Anyone who wanted to ask the Lord about something would go to the Meeting Tent outside the camp .
NCV	Exodus	33	8	Whenever Moses went out to the Tent , all the people would rise and stand at the entrances of their tents , watching him until he entered the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Exodus	33	9	When Moses went into the Tent , the pillar of cloud would always come down and stay at the entrance of the Tent while the Lord spoke with Moses .
NCV	Exodus	33	10	Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud at the entrance of the Tent , they stood and worshiped , each person at the entrance of his own tent .
NCV	Exodus	33	11	The Lord spoke to Moses face to face as a man speaks with his friend . Then Moses would return to the camp , but Moses ’ young helper , Joshua son of Nun , did not leave the Tent .
NCV	Exodus	33	12	Moses said to the Lord , “ You have told me to lead these people , but you did not say whom you would send with me . You have said to me , ‘ I know you very well , and I am pleased with you. ’
NCV	Exodus	33	13	If I have truly pleased you , show me your plans so that I may know you and continue to please you . Remember that this nation is your people. ”
NCV	Exodus	33	14	The Lord answered , “ I myself will go with you , and I will give you victory. ”
NCV	Exodus	33	15	Then Moses said to him , “ If you yourself don ’ t go with us , then don ’ t send us away from this place .
NCV	Exodus	33	16	If you don ’ t go with us , no one will know that you are pleased with me and with your people . These people and I will be no different from any other people on earth. ”
NCV	Exodus	33	17	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I will do what you ask , because I know you very well , and I am pleased with you. ” Moses Sees God ’ s Glory
NCV	Exodus	33	18	Then Moses said , “ Now , please show me your glory. ”
NCV	Exodus	33	19	The Lord answered , “ I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you , and I will announce my name , the Lord , so you can hear it . I will show kindness to anyone to whom I want to show kindness , and I will show mercy to anyone to whom I want to show mercy .
NCV	Exodus	33	20	But you can not see my face , because no one can see me and live .
NCV	Exodus	33	21	“ There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock .
NCV	Exodus	33	22	When my glory passes that place , I will put you in a large crack in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by .
NCV	Exodus	33	23	Then I will take away my hand , and you will see my back . But my face must not be seen. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	34	34	Anytime Moses went before the Lord to speak with him , Moses took off the covering until he came out . Then Moses would come out and tell the Israelites what the Lord had commanded .
NCV	Exodus	34	2	Be ready tomorrow morning , and then come up on Mount Sinai . Stand before me there on the top of the mountain .
NCV	Exodus	34	3	No one may come with you or even be seen any place on the mountain . Not even the flocks or herds may eat grass near that mountain. ”
NCV	Exodus	34	4	So Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones . Then early the next morning he went up Mount Sinai , just as the Lord had commanded him , carrying the two stone tablets with him .
NCV	Exodus	34	5	Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with Moses , and the Lord called out his name : the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	34	6	The Lord passed in front of Moses and said , “ I am the Lord . The Lord is a God who shows mercy , who is kind , who doesn ’ t become angry quickly , who has great love and faithfulness
NCV	Exodus	34	7	and is kind to thousands of people . The Lord forgives people for evil , for sin , and for turning against him , but he does not forget to punish guilty people . He will punish not only the guilty people , but also their children , their grandchildren , their great-grandchildren , and their great-great-grandchildren. ”
NCV	Exodus	34	8	Then Moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped .
NCV	Exodus	34	9	He said , “ Lord , if you are pleased with me , please go with us . I know that these are stubborn people , but forgive our evil and our sin . Take us as your own people. ”
NCV	Exodus	34	10	Then the Lord said , “ I am making this agreement with you . I will do miracles in front of all your people—things that have never before been done for any other nation on earth—and the people with you will see my work . I , the Lord , will do wonderful things for you .
NCV	Exodus	34	11	Obey the things I command you today , and I will force out the Amorites , Canaanites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites ahead of you .
NCV	Exodus	34	12	Be careful that you don ’ t make an agreement with the people who live in the land where you are going , because it will bring you trouble .
NCV	Exodus	34	13	Destroy their altars , break their stone pillars , and cut down their Asherah idols .
NCV	Exodus	34	14	Don ’ t worship any other god , because I , the Lord , the Jealous One , am a jealous God .
NCV	Exodus	34	15	“ Be careful that you don ’ t make an agreement with the people who live in that land . When they worship their gods , they will invite you to join them . Then you will eat their sacrifices .
NCV	Exodus	34	16	If you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters worship gods , they will lead your sons to do the same thing .
NCV	Exodus	34	17	“ Do not make gods of melted metal .
NCV	Exodus	34	18	“ Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread . For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast as I commanded you . Do this during the month I have chosen , the month of Abib , because in that month you came out of Egypt .
NCV	Exodus	34	19	“ The firstborn of every mother belongs to me , including every firstborn male animal that is born in your flocks and herds .
NCV	Exodus	34	20	You may buy back a donkey by paying for it with a lamb , but if you don ’ t want to buy back a donkey , you must break its neck . You must buy back all your firstborn sons . “ No one is to come before me without a gift .
NCV	Exodus	34	21	“ You must work for six days , but on the seventh day you must rest—even during the planting season and the harvest season .
NCV	Exodus	34	22	“ Celebrate the Feast of Weeks when you gather the first grain of the wheat harvest . And celebrate the Feast of Shelters in the fall .
NCV	Exodus	34	23	“ Three times each year all your males must come before the Lord God , the God of Israel .
NCV	Exodus	34	24	I will force out nations ahead of you and expand the borders of your land . You will go before the Lord your God three times each year , and at that time no one will try to take your land from you .
NCV	Exodus	34	25	“ Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me with anything containing yeast , and do not leave any of the sacrifice of the Feast of Passover until the next morning .
NCV	Exodus	34	26	“ Bring the best first crops that you harvest from your ground to the Tent of the Lord your God . “ You must not cook a young goat in its mother ’ s milk. ”
NCV	Exodus	34	27	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write down these words , because with these words I have made an agreement with you and Israel. ”
NCV	Exodus	34	28	Moses stayed there with the Lord forty days and forty nights , and during that time he did not eat food or drink water . And Moses wrote the words of the Agreement—the Ten Commandments—on the stone tablets . The Face of Moses Shines
NCV	Exodus	34	29	Then Moses came down from Mount Sinai , carrying the two stone tablets of the Agreement in his hands . But he did not know that his face was shining because he had talked with the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	34	30	When Aaron and all the people of Israel saw that Moses ’ face was shining , they were afraid to go near him .
NCV	Exodus	34	31	But Moses called to them , so Aaron and all the leaders of the people returned to Moses , and he talked with them .
NCV	Exodus	34	32	After that , all the people of Israel came near him , and he gave them all the commands that the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai .
NCV	Exodus	34	33	When Moses finished speaking to the people , he put a covering over his face .
NCV	Exodus	34	35	They would see that Moses ’ face was shining . So he would cover his face again until the next time he went in to speak with the Lord . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	35	3	On the Sabbath day you must not light a fire in any of your houses. ”
NCV	Exodus	35	4	Moses said to all the Israelites , “ This is what the Lord has commanded :

NCV	Exodus	35	11	the Holy Tent , its outer tent and its covering , the hooks , frames , crossbars , posts , and bases ;
NCV	Exodus	35	12	the Ark of the Agreement , its poles , lid , and the curtain in front of it ;
NCV	Exodus	35	13	the table , and its poles , all the things that go with the table , and the bread that shows we are in God ’ s presence ;
NCV	Exodus	35	14	the lampstand for the light and all the things that go with it , the lamps , and olive oil for the light ;

NCV	Exodus	35	19	the special clothes that the priest will wear in the Holy Place . These are the holy clothes for Aaron the priest and his sons to wear when they serve as priests. ”
NCV	Exodus	35	20	Then all the people of Israel went away from Moses .
NCV	Exodus	35	21	Everyone who wanted to give came and brought a gift to the Lord for making the Meeting Tent , all the things in the Tent , and the special clothes .
NCV	Exodus	35	22	All the men and women who wanted to give brought gold jewelry of all kinds—pins , earrings , rings , and bracelets . They all presented their gold to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	35	23	Everyone who had blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen , and anyone who had goat hair or male sheepskins colored red or fine leather brought them to the Lord .
NCV	Exodus	35	24	Everyone who could give silver or bronze brought that as a gift to the Lord , and everyone who had acacia wood to be used in the work brought it .
NCV	Exodus	35	25	Every skilled woman used her hands to make the blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen , and they brought what they had made .
NCV	Exodus	35	26	All the women who were skilled and wanted to help made thread of the goat hair .
NCV	Exodus	35	27	The leaders brought onyx stones and other jewels to put on the holy vest and chest covering for the priest .
NCV	Exodus	35	28	They also brought spices and olive oil for the sweet-smelling incense , the special oil , and the oil to burn in the lamps .
NCV	Exodus	35	29	All the men and women of Israel who wanted to help brought gifts to the Lord for all the work the Lord had commanded Moses and the people to do .
NCV	Exodus	35	30	Then Moses said to the Israelites , “ Look , the Lord has chosen Bezalel son of Uri the son of Hur , from the tribe of Judah .
NCV	Exodus	35	31	The Lord has filled Bezalel with the Spirit of God and has given him the skill , ability , and knowledge to do all kinds of work .
NCV	Exodus	35	32	He is able to design pieces to be made of gold , silver , and bronze ,
NCV	Exodus	35	33	to cut stones and jewels and put them in metal , to carve wood , and to do all kinds of work .
NCV	Exodus	35	34	Also , the Lord has given Bezalel and Oholiab , the son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan , the ability to teach others .
NCV	Exodus	35	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Exodus	36	36	They made four posts of acacia wood for it and covered them with gold . Then they made gold hooks for the posts , as well as four silver bases in which to set the posts .
NCV	Exodus	36	1	So Bezalel , Oholiab , and every skilled person will do the work the Lord has commanded , because he gave them the wisdom and understanding to do all the skilled work needed to build the Holy Tent. ”
NCV	Exodus	36	2	Then Moses called Bezalel , Oholiab , and all the other skilled people to whom the Lord had given skills , and they came because they wanted to help with the work .
NCV	Exodus	36	3	They received from Moses everything the people of Israel had brought as gifts to build the Holy Tent . The people continued to bring gifts each morning because they wanted to .
NCV	Exodus	36	4	So all the skilled workers left the work they were doing on the Holy Tent ,
NCV	Exodus	36	5	and they said to Moses , “ The people are bringing more than we need to do the work the Lord commanded. ”
NCV	Exodus	36	6	Then Moses sent this command throughout the camp : “ No man or woman should make anything else as a gift for the Holy Tent. ” So the people were kept from giving more ,
NCV	Exodus	36	7	because what they had was already more than enough to do all the work . The Holy Tent
NCV	Exodus	36	8	Then the skilled workers made the Holy Tent . They made the ten curtains of blue , purple , and red cloth , and they sewed designs of creatures with wings on the curtains .
NCV	Exodus	36	9	Each curtain was the same size—forty-two feet long and six feet wide .
NCV	Exodus	36	10	Five of the curtains were fastened together to make one set , and the other five were fastened together to make another set .
NCV	Exodus	36	11	Then they made loops of blue cloth along the edge of the end curtain on the first set of five , and they did the same thing with the other set of five .
NCV	Exodus	36	12	There were fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the other curtain , with the loops opposite each other .
NCV	Exodus	36	13	They made fifty gold hooks to join the two curtains together so that the Holy Tent was joined together as one piece .
NCV	Exodus	36	14	Then the workers made another tent of eleven curtains made of goat hair , to put over the Holy Tent .
NCV	Exodus	36	15	All eleven curtains were the same size—forty-five feet long and six feet wide .
NCV	Exodus	36	16	The workers sewed five curtains together into one set and six together into another set .
NCV	Exodus	36	17	They made fifty loops along the edge of the outside curtain of one set and fifty loops along the edge of the outside curtain of the other set .
NCV	Exodus	36	18	Then they made fifty bronze rings to join the two sets of cloth together and make the tent one piece .
NCV	Exodus	36	19	They made two more coverings for the outer tent—one made of male sheepskins colored red and the other made of fine leather .
NCV	Exodus	36	20	Then they made upright frames of acacia wood for the Holy Tent .
NCV	Exodus	36	21	Each frame was fifteen feet tall and twenty-seven inches wide ,
NCV	Exodus	36	22	and there were two pegs side by side on each one . Every frame of the Holy Tent was made this same way .
NCV	Exodus	36	23	They made twenty frames for the south side of the Tent ,
NCV	Exodus	36	24	and they made forty silver bases that went under the twenty frames . There were two bases for every frame—one for each peg of each frame .
NCV	Exodus	36	25	They also made twenty frames for the north side of the Holy Tent
NCV	Exodus	36	26	and forty silver bases—two to go under each frame .
NCV	Exodus	36	27	They made six frames for the rear or west end of the Holy Tent
NCV	Exodus	36	28	and two frames for the corners at the rear of the Holy Tent .
NCV	Exodus	36	29	These two frames were doubled at the bottom and joined at the top with a metal ring . They did this for each of these corners .
NCV	Exodus	36	30	So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two bases under each frame .
NCV	Exodus	36	31	Then they made crossbars of acacia wood to connect the upright frames of the Holy Tent . Five crossbars held the frames together on one side of the Tent ,
NCV	Exodus	36	32	and five held the frames together on the other side . Also , five crossbars held the frames together on the west end , at the rear of the Tent .
NCV	Exodus	36	33	They made the middle crossbar run along the entire length of each side and rear of the Tent . It was set halfway up the frames .
NCV	Exodus	36	34	They made gold rings on the sides of the frames to hold the crossbars , and they covered the frames and the crossbars with gold .
NCV	Exodus	36	35	Then they made the curtain of blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen . A skilled craftsman sewed designs of creatures with wings on it .
NCV	Exodus	36	37	For the entrance to the Tent , they made a curtain of blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen . A person who sewed well sewed designs on it .
NCV	Exodus	36	38	Then they made five posts and hooks for it . They covered the tops of the posts and their bands with gold , and they made five bronze bases for the posts . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Exodus	37	17	Then he made the lampstand of pure gold , hammering out its base and stand . Its flower-like cups , buds , and petals were joined together in one piece with the base and stand .
NCV	Exodus	37	18	Six branches went out from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other .
NCV	Exodus	37	19	Each branch had three cups shaped like almond flowers , and each cup had a bud and a petal . Each of the six branches going out from the lampstand was the same .
NCV	Exodus	37	20	There were four more cups shaped like almond flowers on the lampstand itself , each with its buds and petals .
NCV	Exodus	37	21	Three pairs of branches went out from the lampstand . A bud was under the place where each pair was attached to the lampstand . Each of the six branches going out from the lampstand was the same .
NCV	Exodus	37	22	The buds , branches , and lampstand were all one piece of pure , hammered gold .
NCV	Exodus	37	23	He made seven pure gold lamps for this lampstand , and he made pure gold wick trimmers and trays .

NCV	Exodus	37	26	He covered the top and all the sides and the corners with pure gold , and he put gold trim around the altar .

NCV	Exodus	39	39	the bronze altar and its screen , its poles and all its tools , the bowl and its stand ;
NCV	Exodus	39	2	They made the holy vest of gold , and blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen .
NCV	Exodus	39	3	They hammered the gold into sheets and then cut it into long , thin strips . They worked the gold into the blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen . This was done by skilled craftsmen .
NCV	Exodus	39	4	They made the shoulder straps for the holy vest , which were attached to the top corners of the vest and tied together over each shoulder .
NCV	Exodus	39	5	The skillfully woven belt was made in the same way ; it was joined to the holy vest as one piece . It was made of gold , and blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen , the way the Lord commanded Moses .
NCV	Exodus	39	6	They put gold around the onyx stones and then wrote the names of the sons of Israel on these gems , as a person carves words and designs on a seal .
NCV	Exodus	39	7	Then they attached the gems on the shoulder straps of the holy vest , as reminders of the twelve sons of Israel . This was done just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Exodus	39	8	The skilled craftsmen made the chest covering like the holy vest ; it was made of gold , and blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen .
NCV	Exodus	39	9	The chest covering was square—nine inches long and nine inches wide—and it was folded double to make a pocket .
NCV	Exodus	39	10	Then they put four rows of beautiful jewels on it : In the first row there was a ruby , a topaz , and a yellow quartz ;
NCV	Exodus	39	11	in the second there was a turquoise , a sapphire , and an emerald ;
NCV	Exodus	39	12	in the third there was a jacinth , an agate , and an amethyst ;
NCV	Exodus	39	13	in the fourth there was a chrysolite , an onyx , and a jasper . Gold was put around these jewels to attach them to the chest covering ,
NCV	Exodus	39	14	and the names of the sons of Israel were carved on these twelve jewels as a person carves a seal . Each jewel had the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
NCV	Exodus	39	15	They made chains of pure gold , twisted together like a rope , for the chest covering .
NCV	Exodus	39	16	The workers made two gold pieces and two gold rings . They put the two gold rings on the two upper corners of the chest covering .
NCV	Exodus	39	17	Then they put two gold chains in the two rings at the ends of the chest covering ,
NCV	Exodus	39	18	and they fastened the other two ends of the chains to the two gold pieces . They attached these gold pieces to the two shoulder straps in the front of the holy vest .
NCV	Exodus	39	19	They made two gold rings and put them at the lower corners of the chest covering on the inside edge next to the holy vest .
NCV	Exodus	39	20	They made two more gold rings on the bottom of the shoulder straps in front of the holy vest , near the seam , just above the woven belt of the holy vest .
NCV	Exodus	39	21	They used a blue ribbon and tied the rings of the chest covering to the rings of the holy vest , connecting it to the woven belt . In this way the chest covering would not swing out from the holy vest . They did all these things the way the Lord commanded .
NCV	Exodus	39	22	Then they made the outer robe to be worn under the holy vest . It was woven only of blue cloth .
NCV	Exodus	39	23	They made a hole in the center of the outer robe , with a woven collar sewn around it so it would not tear .
NCV	Exodus	39	24	Then they made balls like pomegranates of blue , purple , and red thread , and fine linen and hung them around the bottom of the outer robe .
NCV	Exodus	39	25	They also made bells of pure gold and hung these around the bottom of the outer robe between the balls .
NCV	Exodus	39	26	So around the bottom of the outer robe there was a bell and a pomegranate ball , a bell and a pomegranate ball . The priest wore this outer robe when he served as priest , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Exodus	39	27	They wove inner robes of fine linen for Aaron and his sons ,
NCV	Exodus	39	28	and they made turbans , headbands , and underclothes of fine linen .
NCV	Exodus	39	29	Then they made the cloth belt of fine linen , and blue , purple , and red thread , and designs were sewn onto it , just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Exodus	39	30	They made a strip of pure gold , which is the holy crown , and carved these words in the gold , as one might carve on a seal : “ Holy to the Lord. ”
NCV	Exodus	39	31	Then they tied this flat piece to the turban with a blue ribbon , as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Exodus	39	32	So all the work on the Meeting Tent was finished . The Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Exodus	39	33	Then they brought the Holy Tent to Moses : the Tent and all its furniture , hooks , frames , crossbars , posts , and bases ;
NCV	Exodus	39	34	the covering made of male sheepskins colored red , the covering made of fine leather , and the curtain that covered the entrance to the Most Holy Place ;
NCV	Exodus	39	35	the Ark of the Agreement , its poles and lid ;
NCV	Exodus	39	36	the table , all its containers , and the bread that showed they were in God ’ s presence ;
NCV	Exodus	39	37	the pure gold lampstand with its lamps in a row , all its tools , and the olive oil for the light ;
NCV	Exodus	39	38	the gold altar , the special olive oil used for appointing priests , the sweet-smelling incense , and the curtain that covered the entrance to the Tent ;
NCV	Exodus	39	40	the curtains for the courtyard with their posts and bases , the curtain that covered the entry to the courtyard , the cords , pegs , and all the things in the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Exodus	39	41	They brought the clothes for the priests to wear when they served in the Holy Tent—the holy clothes for Aaron the priest and the clothes for his sons , which they wore when they served as priests .
NCV	Exodus	39	42	The Israelites had done all this work just as the Lord had commanded Moses .

NCV	Exodus	40	13	Then put the holy clothes on Aaron . Pour the special oil on him , and give him for service to God so that he may serve me as a priest .
NCV	Exodus	40	14	Bring Aaron ’ s sons and put the inner robes on them .

NCV	Exodus	40	20	Moses put the stone tablets that had the Agreement written on them into the Ark . He put the poles through the rings of the Ark and put the lid on it .
NCV	Exodus	40	21	Next he brought the Ark into the Tent and hung the curtain to cover the Ark , just as the Lord commanded him .
NCV	Exodus	40	22	Moses put the table in the Meeting Tent on the north side of the Holy Tent in front of the curtain .
NCV	Exodus	40	23	Then he put the bread on the table before the Lord , just as the Lord commanded him .
NCV	Exodus	40	24	Moses put the lampstand in the Meeting Tent on the south side of the Holy Tent across from the table .

NCV	Leviticus	5	2	“ ‘ Or someone might touch something unclean , such as the dead body of an unclean wild animal or an unclean farm animal or an unclean crawling animal . Even if he does not know that he touched it , he will still be unclean and guilty of sin .
NCV	Leviticus	5	3	“ ‘ Someone might touch human uncleanness—anything that makes someone unclean—and not know it . But when he learns about it , he will be guilty .
NCV	Leviticus	5	4	“ ‘ Or someone might make a promise before the Lord without thinking . It might be a promise to do something bad or something good ; it might be about anything . Even if he forgets about it , when he remembers , he will be guilty .
NCV	Leviticus	5	6	He must bring an offering to the Lord as a penalty for sin ; it must be a female lamb or goat from the flock . The priest will perform the acts to remove that person ’ s sin so he will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	5	7	“ ‘ But if the person can not afford a lamb , he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the Lord as the penalty for his sin . One bird must be for a sin offering , and the other must be for a whole burnt offering .
NCV	Leviticus	5	8	He must bring them to the priest , who will first offer the one for the sin offering . He will pull the bird ’ s head from its neck , but he will not pull it completely off .
NCV	Leviticus	5	9	He must sprinkle the blood from the sin offering on the side of the altar , and then he must pour the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar ; it is a sin offering .
NCV	Leviticus	5	10	Then the priest must offer the second bird as a whole burnt offering , as the law says . In this way the priest will remove the person ’ s sin so he will belong to the Lord , and the Lord will forgive him .
NCV	Leviticus	5	11	“ ‘ If the person can not afford two doves or two pigeons , he must bring about two quarts of fine flour as an offering for sin . He must not put oil or incense on the flour , because it is a sin offering .
NCV	Leviticus	5	12	He must bring the flour to the priest . The priest will take a handful of the flour as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar on top of the offerings made by fire to the Lord ; it is a sin offering .
NCV	Leviticus	5	13	In this way the priest will remove the person ’ s sins so he will belong to the Lord , and the Lord will forgive him . What is left of the sin offering belongs to the priest , like the grain offering. ’ ” The Penalty Offering
NCV	Leviticus	5	14	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	5	15	“ If a person accidentally sins and does something against the holy things of the Lord , he must bring from the flock a male sheep that has nothing wrong with it . This will be his penalty offering to the Lord . Its value in silver must be correct as set by the Holy Place measure . It is a penalty offering .
NCV	Leviticus	5	16	That person must pay for the sin he did against the holy thing , adding one-fifth to its value . Then he must give it all to the priest . In this way the priest will remove the person ’ s sin so he will belong to the Lord , by using the male sheep as the penalty offering . And the Lord will forgive the person .
NCV	Leviticus	5	17	“ If a person sins and does something the Lord has commanded not to be done , even if he does not know it , he is still guilty . He is responsible for his sin .
NCV	Leviticus	5	18	He must bring the priest a male sheep from the flock , one that has nothing wrong with it and that is worth the correct amount . It will be a penalty offering . Though the person sinned without knowing it , with this offering the priest will remove the sin so the person will belong to the Lord , and the Lord will forgive him .
NCV	Leviticus	5	19	The person is guilty of doing wrong , so he must give the penalty offering to the Lord. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Leviticus	5	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Leviticus	6	6	He must bring his penalty to the priest—a male sheep from the flock , one that does not have anything wrong with it and that is worth the correct amount . It will be a penalty offering to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	6	2	“ A person might sin against the Lord by doing one of these sins : He might lie about what happened to something he was taking care of for someone else , or he might lie about a promise he made . He might steal something or cheat someone .
NCV	Leviticus	6	3	He might find something that had been lost and then lie about it . He might make a promise before the Lord about something and not mean it , or he might do some other sin .
NCV	Leviticus	6	4	If he does any of these things , he is guilty of sin . He must bring back whatever he stole or whatever he took by cheating . He must bring back the thing he took care of for someone else . He must bring back what he found and lied about
NCV	Leviticus	6	5	or what he made a false promise about . He must pay the full price plus an extra one-fifth of the value of what he took . He must give the money to the true owner on the day he brings his penalty offering .
NCV	Leviticus	6	7	Then the priest will perform the acts to remove that person ’ s sin so he will belong to the Lord , and the Lord will forgive him for the sins that made him guilty. ” The Whole Burnt Offering
NCV	Leviticus	6	8	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	6	9	“ Give this command to Aaron and the priests : ‘ These are the teachings about the whole burnt offering : The burnt offering must stay on the altar all night until morning , and the altar ’ s fire must be kept burning .
NCV	Leviticus	6	10	The priest must put on his linen robe and linen underclothes next to his body . Then he will remove the ashes from the burnt offering on the altar and put them beside the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	6	11	Then he must take off those clothes and put on others and carry the ashes outside the camp to a special clean place .
NCV	Leviticus	6	12	But the fire must be kept burning on the altar ; it must not be allowed to go out . The priest must put more firewood on the altar every morning , place the whole burnt offering on the fire , and burn the fat of the fellowship offerings .
NCV	Leviticus	6	13	The fire must be kept burning on the altar all the time ; it must not go out . The Grain Offering
NCV	Leviticus	6	14	“ ‘ These are the teachings about the grain offering : The priests must bring it to the Lord in front of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	6	15	The priest must take a handful of fine flour , with the oil and all of the incense on it , and burn the grain offering on the altar as a memorial offering to the Lord . Its smell is pleasing to him .
NCV	Leviticus	6	16	Aaron and the priests may eat what is left , but it must be eaten without yeast in a holy place . They must eat it in the courtyard of the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Leviticus	6	17	It must not be cooked with yeast . I have given it as their share of the offerings made to me by fire ; it is most holy , like the sin offering and the penalty offering .
NCV	Leviticus	6	18	Any male descendant of Aaron may eat it as his share of the offerings made to the Lord by fire , and this will continue from now on . Whatever touches these offerings shall become holy. ’ ”
NCV	Leviticus	6	19	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	6	20	“ This is the offering Aaron and the priests must bring to the Lord on the day they appoint Aaron as high priest : They must bring two quarts of fine flour for a continual grain offering , half of it in the morning and half in the evening .
NCV	Leviticus	6	21	The fine flour must be mixed with oil and cooked on a griddle . Bring it when it is well mixed . Present the grain offering that is broken into pieces , and it will be a smell that is pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	6	22	One of the priests appointed to take Aaron ’ s place as high priest must make the grain offering . It is a rule forever that the grain offering must be completely burned to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	6	23	Every grain offering made by a priest must be completely burned ; it must not be eaten. ” The Sin Offering
NCV	Leviticus	6	24	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	6	25	“ Tell Aaron and the priests : ‘ These are the teachings about the sin offering : The sin offering must be killed in front of the Lord in the same place the whole burnt offering is killed ; it is most holy .
NCV	Leviticus	6	26	The priest who offers the sin offering must eat it in a holy place , in the courtyard of the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Leviticus	6	27	Whatever touches the meat of the sin offering must be holy , and if the blood is sprinkled on any clothes , you must wash them in a holy place .
NCV	Leviticus	6	28	The clay pot the meat is cooked in must be broken , or if a bronze pot is used , it must be scrubbed and rinsed with water .
NCV	Leviticus	6	29	Any male in a priest ’ s family may eat the offering ; it is most holy .
NCV	Leviticus	6	30	But if the blood of the sin offering is taken into the Meeting Tent and used to remove sin in the Holy Place , that sin offering must be burned with fire . It must not be eaten . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Leviticus	6	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Leviticus	7	7	“ ‘ The penalty offering is like the sin offering in that the teachings are the same for both . The priest who offers the sacrifice to remove sins will get the meat for food .
NCV	Leviticus	7	2	The penalty offering must be killed where the whole burnt offering is killed . Then the priest must sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	7	3	He must offer all the fat from the penalty offering—the fat tail , the fat that covers the inner organs ,
NCV	Leviticus	7	4	both kidneys with the fat that is on them near the lower back muscle , and the best part of the liver , which is to be removed with the kidneys .
NCV	Leviticus	7	5	The priest must burn all these things on the altar as an offering made by fire to the Lord . It is a penalty offering .
NCV	Leviticus	7	6	Any male in a priest ’ s family may eat it . It is most holy , so it must be eaten in a holy place .
NCV	Leviticus	7	8	The priest who offers the burnt offering may also have the skin from it .
NCV	Leviticus	7	9	Every grain offering that is baked in an oven , cooked on a griddle , or baked in a dish belongs to the priest who offers it .
NCV	Leviticus	7	10	Every grain offering , either dry or mixed with oil , belongs to the priests , and all priests will share alike . The Fellowship Offering
NCV	Leviticus	7	11	“ ‘ These are the teachings about the fellowship offering a person may offer to the Lord :
NCV	Leviticus	7	12	If he brings the fellowship offering to show his thanks , he should also bring loaves of bread made without yeast that are mixed with oil , wafers made without yeast that have oil poured over them , and loaves of fine flour that are mixed with oil .
NCV	Leviticus	7	13	He must also offer loaves of bread made with yeast along with his fellowship offering , which he gives to show thanks .
NCV	Leviticus	7	14	One of each kind of offering will be for the Lord ; it will be given to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offering .
NCV	Leviticus	7	15	When the fellowship offering is given to thank the Lord , the meat from it must be eaten the same day it is offered ; none of it must be left until morning .
NCV	Leviticus	7	16	“ ‘ If a person brings a fellowship offering just to give a gift to God or because of a special promise to him , the sacrifice should be eaten the same day he offers it . If there is any left , it may be eaten the next day .
NCV	Leviticus	7	17	If any meat from this sacrifice is left on the third day , it must be burned up .
NCV	Leviticus	7	18	Any meat of the fellowship offering eaten on the third day will not be accepted , nor will the sacrifice count for the person who offered it . It will become unclean , and anyone who eats the meat will be guilty of sin .
NCV	Leviticus	7	19	“ ‘ People must not eat meat that touches anything unclean ; they must burn this meat with fire . Anyone who is clean may eat other meat .
NCV	Leviticus	7	20	But if anyone is unclean and eats the meat from the fellowship offering that belongs to the Lord , he must be cut off from his people .
NCV	Leviticus	7	21	“ ‘ If anyone touches something unclean—uncleanness that comes from people , from an animal , or from some hated thing—touching it will make him unclean . If he then eats meat from the fellowship offering that belongs to the Lord , he must be cut off from his people. ’ ”
NCV	Leviticus	7	22	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	7	23	“ Tell the people of Israel : ‘ You must not eat any of the fat from cattle , sheep , or goats .
NCV	Leviticus	7	24	If an animal is found dead or torn by wild animals , you may use its fat for other things , but you must not eat it .
NCV	Leviticus	7	25	If someone eats fat from an animal offering made by fire to the Lord , he must be cut off from his people .
NCV	Leviticus	7	26	No matter where you live , you must not eat blood from any bird or animal .
NCV	Leviticus	7	27	Anyone who eats blood must be cut off from his people. ’ ” The Priests ’ Share
NCV	Leviticus	7	28	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	7	29	“ Tell the people of Israel : ‘ If someone brings a fellowship offering to the Lord , he must give part of it as his sacrifice to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	7	30	He must carry that part of the gift in his own hands as an offering made by fire to the Lord . He must bring the fat and the breast of the animal to the priest , to be presented to the Lord as the priests ’ share .
NCV	Leviticus	7	31	Then the priest must burn the fat on the altar , but the breast of the animal will belong to Aaron and the priests .
NCV	Leviticus	7	32	You must also give the right thigh from the fellowship offering to the priest as a gift ;
NCV	Leviticus	7	33	it will belong to the priest who offers the blood and fat of the fellowship offering .
NCV	Leviticus	7	34	I have taken the breast and the thigh from the fellowship offerings of the Israelites , and I have given these parts to Aaron and the priests as their share for all time from the Israelites. ’ ”
NCV	Leviticus	7	35	This is the portion that belongs to Aaron and his sons from the offerings made by fire to the Lord . They were given this share on the day they were presented to the Lord as priests .
NCV	Leviticus	7	36	On the day the Lord appointed the priests , he commanded Israel to give this share to them , and it is to be given to the priests as their share from now on .
NCV	Leviticus	7	37	These are the teachings about the whole burnt offering , the grain offering , the sin offering , the penalty offering , the offering for the appointment of priests , and the fellowship offering .
NCV	Leviticus	7	38	The Lord gave these teachings to Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord in the Sinai Desert . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	8	8	Then Moses put the chest covering on him and put the Urim and the Thummim in the chest covering .
NCV	Leviticus	8	2	“ Bring Aaron and his sons and their clothes , the special olive oil used in appointing people and things to the service of the Lord , the bull of the sin offering and the two male sheep , and the basket of bread made without yeast .
NCV	Leviticus	8	3	Then gather the people together at the entrance to the Meeting Tent. ”
NCV	Leviticus	8	4	Moses did as the Lord commanded him , and the people met together at the entrance to the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Leviticus	8	5	Then Moses spoke to the people and said , “ This is what the Lord has commanded to be done. ”
NCV	Leviticus	8	6	Bringing Aaron and his sons forward , Moses washed them with water .
NCV	Leviticus	8	7	He put the inner robe on Aaron and tied the cloth belt around him . Then Moses put the outer robe on him and placed the holy vest on him . He tied the skillfully woven belt around him so that the holy vest was tied to Aaron .
NCV	Leviticus	8	9	He also put the turban on Aaron ’ s head . He put the strip of gold , the holy crown , on the front of the turban , as the Lord commanded him to do .
NCV	Leviticus	8	10	Then Moses put the special oil on the Holy Tent and everything in it , making them holy for the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	8	11	He sprinkled some oil on the altar seven times , sprinkling the altar and all its tools and the large bowl and its base . In this way he made them holy for the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	8	12	He poured some of the special oil on Aaron ’ s head to make Aaron holy for the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	8	13	Then Moses brought Aaron ’ s sons forward . He put the inner robes on them , tied cloth belts around them , and put headbands on them , as the Lord had commanded him .
NCV	Leviticus	8	14	Then Moses brought the bull for the sin offering , and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head .
NCV	Leviticus	8	15	Moses killed the bull , took the blood , and with his finger put some of it on all the corners of the altar , to make it pure . Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar . In this way he made it holy and ready for service to God .
NCV	Leviticus	8	16	Moses took all the fat from the inner organs of the bull , the best part of the liver , and both kidneys with the fat that is on them , and he burned them on the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	8	17	But he took the bull ’ s skin , its meat , and its intestines and burned them in a fire outside the camp , as the Lord had commanded him .
NCV	Leviticus	8	18	Next Moses brought the male sheep of the burnt offering , and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head .
NCV	Leviticus	8	19	Then Moses killed it and sprinkled the blood on all sides of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	8	20	He cut the male sheep into pieces and burned the head , the pieces , and the fat .
NCV	Leviticus	8	21	He washed the inner organs and legs with water and burned the whole sheep on the altar as a burnt offering made by fire to the Lord ; its smell was pleasing to the Lord . Moses did these things as the Lord had commanded him .
NCV	Leviticus	8	22	Then Moses brought the other male sheep , the one used in appointing Aaron and his sons as priests , and Aaron and his sons put their hands on its head .
NCV	Leviticus	8	23	Then Moses killed the sheep and put some of its blood on the bottom of Aaron ’ s right ear , some on the thumb of Aaron ’ s right hand , and some on the big toe of his right foot .
NCV	Leviticus	8	24	Then Moses brought Aaron ’ s sons close to the altar . He put some of the blood on the bottom of their right ears , some on the thumbs of their right hands , and some on the big toes of their right feet . Then he sprinkled blood on all sides of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	8	25	He took the fat , the fat tail , all the fat on the inner organs , the best part of the liver , both kidneys with their fat , and the right thigh .
NCV	Leviticus	8	26	From the basket of bread made without yeast that is put before the Lord each day , Moses took a loaf of bread , a loaf made with oil , and a wafer . He put these pieces of bread on the fat and right thigh of the male sheep .
NCV	Leviticus	8	27	All these things he put in the hands of Aaron and his sons and presented them as an offering before the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	8	28	Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering . So this was the offering for appointing Aaron and his sons as priests . It was an offering made by fire to the Lord , and its smell was pleasing to him .
NCV	Leviticus	8	29	Moses also took the breast and presented it as an offering before the Lord . It was Moses ’ share of the male sheep used in appointing the priests , as the Lord had commanded him .
NCV	Leviticus	8	30	Moses took some of the special oil and some of the blood which was on the altar , and he sprinkled them on Aaron and Aaron ’ s clothes and on Aaron ’ s sons and their clothes . In this way Moses made Aaron , his clothes , his sons , and their clothes holy for the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	8	31	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons , “ I gave you a command , saying , ‘ Aaron and his sons will eat these things. ’ So take the meat and basket of bread from the offering for appointing priests . Boil the meat at the door of the Meeting Tent , and eat it there with the bread .
NCV	Leviticus	8	32	If any of the meat or bread is left , burn it .
NCV	Leviticus	8	33	The time of appointing will last seven days ; you must not go outside the entrance of the Meeting Tent until that time is up . Stay there until the time of your appointing is finished .
NCV	Leviticus	8	34	The Lord commanded the things that were done today to remove your sins so you will belong to him .
NCV	Leviticus	8	35	You must stay at the entrance of the Meeting Tent day and night for seven days . If you don ’ t obey the Lord ’ s commands , you will die . The Lord has given me these commands. ”
NCV	Leviticus	8	36	So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord had commanded through Moses . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	9	9	Then his sons brought the blood to him , and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the corners of the altar . He poured out the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	2	He said to Aaron , “ Take a bull calf and a male sheep that have nothing wrong with them , and offer them to the Lord . The calf will be a sin offering , and the male sheep will be a whole burnt offering .
NCV	Leviticus	9	3	Tell the people of Israel , ‘ Take a male goat for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb for a whole burnt offering ; each must be one year old , and it must have nothing wrong with it .
NCV	Leviticus	9	4	Also take a bull and a male sheep for fellowship offerings , along with a grain offering mixed with oil . Offer all these things to the Lord , because the Lord will appear to you today. ’ ”
NCV	Leviticus	9	5	So all the people came to the front of the Meeting Tent , bringing the things Moses had commanded them to bring , and they stood before the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	9	6	Moses said , “ You have done what the Lord commanded , so you will see the Lord ’ s glory. ”
NCV	Leviticus	9	7	Then Moses told Aaron , “ Go to the altar and offer sin offerings and whole burnt offerings . Do this to remove your sins and the people ’ s sins so you will belong to God . Offer the sacrifices for the people and perform the acts to remove their sins for them so they will belong to the Lord , as the Lord has commanded. ”
NCV	Leviticus	9	8	So Aaron went to the altar and killed the bull calf as a sin offering for himself .
NCV	Leviticus	9	10	Aaron took the fat , the kidneys , and the best part of the liver from the sin offering and burned them on the altar , in the way the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Leviticus	9	11	The meat and skin he burned outside the camp .
NCV	Leviticus	9	12	Then Aaron killed the animal for the whole burnt offering . His sons brought the blood to him , and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	13	As they gave him the pieces and head of the burnt offering , Aaron burned them on the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	14	He also washed the inner organs and the legs of the burnt offering and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	15	Then Aaron brought the offering that was for the people . He took the goat of the people ’ s sin offering and killed it and offered it for the sin offering , just as he had done the first sin offering .
NCV	Leviticus	9	16	Then Aaron brought the whole burnt offering and offered it in the way that the Lord had commanded .
NCV	Leviticus	9	17	He also brought the grain offering to the altar . He took a handful of the grain and burned it on the altar , in addition to the morning ’ s burnt offering .
NCV	Leviticus	9	18	Aaron also killed the bull and the male sheep as the fellowship offerings for the people . His sons brought him the blood , and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	19	Aaron ’ s sons also brought to Aaron the fat of the bull and the male sheep—the fat tail , the fat covering the inner organs , the kidneys , and the best part of the liver .
NCV	Leviticus	9	20	Aaron ’ s sons put them on the breasts of the bull and the sheep . Then Aaron burned these fat parts on the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	21	He presented the breasts and the right thigh before the Lord as the priests ’ share of the offering , as Moses had commanded .
NCV	Leviticus	9	22	Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them . When he had finished offering the sin offering , the burnt offering , and the fellowship offering , he stepped down from the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	9	23	Moses and Aaron went into the Meeting Tent . Then they came out and blessed the people , and the Lord ’ s glory came to all the people .
NCV	Leviticus	9	24	Fire came out from the Lord and burned up the burnt offering and fat on the altar . When the people saw this , they shouted with joy and bowed facedown on the ground . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	10	10	You must keep what is holy separate from what is not holy ; you must keep what is clean separate from what is unclean .
NCV	Leviticus	10	2	So fire came down from the Lord and destroyed Nadab and Abihu , and they died in front of the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	10	3	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ This is what the Lord was speaking about when he said , ‘ I must be respected as holy by those who come near me ; before all the people I must be given honor. ’ ” So Aaron did not say anything about the death of his sons .
NCV	Leviticus	10	4	Aaron ’ s uncle Uzziel had two sons named Mishael and Elzaphan . Moses said to them , “ Come here and pick up your cousins ’ bodies . Carry them outside the camp away from the front of the Holy Place. ”
NCV	Leviticus	10	5	So Mishael and Elzaphan obeyed Moses and carried the bodies of Nadab and Abihu , still clothed in the special priest ’ s inner robes , outside the camp .
NCV	Leviticus	10	6	Then Moses said to Aaron and his other sons , Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Don ’ t show sadness by tearing your clothes or leaving your hair uncombed . If you do , you will die , and the Lord will be angry with all the people . All the people of Israel , your relatives , may cry loudly about the Lord burning Nadab and Abihu ,
NCV	Leviticus	10	7	but you must not even leave the Meeting Tent . If you go out of the entrance , you will die , because the Lord has appointed you to his service. ” So Aaron , Eleazar , and Ithamar obeyed Moses .
NCV	Leviticus	10	8	Then the Lord said to Aaron ,
NCV	Leviticus	10	9	“ You and your sons must not drink wine or beer when you go into the Meeting Tent . If you do , you will die . This law will continue from now on .
NCV	Leviticus	10	11	You must teach the people all the laws that the Lord gave to them through Moses. ”
NCV	Leviticus	10	12	Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons , Eleazar and Ithamar , “ Eat the part of the grain offering that is left from the sacrifices offered by fire to the Lord , but do not add yeast to it . Eat it near the altar because it is most holy .
NCV	Leviticus	10	13	You must eat it in a holy place , because this part of the offerings made by fire to the Lord belongs to you and your sons . I have been commanded to tell you this .
NCV	Leviticus	10	14	“ Also , you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast and thigh of the fellowship offering that was presented to the Lord . You must eat them in a clean place ; they are your share of the fellowship offerings given by the Israelites .
NCV	Leviticus	10	15	The people must bring the fat from their animals that was part of the offering made by fire , and they must present it to the Lord along with the thigh and the breast of the fellowship offering . They will be the regular share of the offerings for you and your children , as the Lord has commanded. ”
NCV	Leviticus	10	16	Moses looked for the goat of the sin offering , but it had already been burned up . So he became very angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron ’ s remaining sons . He said ,
NCV	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why didn ’ t you eat that goat in a holy place ? It is most holy , and the Lord gave it to you to take away the guilt of the people , to remove their sins so they will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	10	18	You didn ’ t bring the goat ’ s blood inside the Holy Place . You were supposed to eat the goat in a holy place , as I commanded ! ”
NCV	Leviticus	10	19	But Aaron said to Moses , “ Today they brought their sin offering and burnt offering before the Lord , but these terrible things have still happened to me ! Do you think the Lord would be any happier if I ate the sin offering today ? ”
NCV	Leviticus	10	20	When Moses heard this , he was satisfied . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	11	11	You must not eat any meat from them or even touch their dead bodies , because you should hate them .
NCV	Leviticus	11	2	“ Tell the Israelites this : ‘ These are the land animals you may eat :
NCV	Leviticus	11	3	You may eat any animal that has split hoofs completely divided and that chews the cud .
NCV	Leviticus	11	4	“ ‘ Some animals only chew the cud or only have split hoofs , and you must not eat them . The camel chews the cud but does not have a split hoof ; it is unclean for you .
NCV	Leviticus	11	5	The rock badger chews the cud but does not have a split hoof ; it is unclean for you .
NCV	Leviticus	11	6	The rabbit chews the cud but does not have a split hoof ; it is unclean for you .
NCV	Leviticus	11	7	Now the pig has a split hoof that is completely divided , but it does not chew the cud ; it is unclean for you .

NCV	Leviticus	16	16	Because the people of Israel have been unclean , Aaron will perform the acts to make the Most Holy Place ready for service to the Lord . Then it will be clean from the sins and crimes of the Israelites . He must also do this for the Meeting Tent , because it stays in the middle of unclean people .
NCV	Leviticus	16	2	The Lord said to him , “ Tell your brother Aaron that there are times when he can not go behind the curtain into the Most Holy Place where the Ark is . If he goes in when I appear in a cloud over the lid on the Ark , he will die .
NCV	Leviticus	16	3	“ This is how Aaron may enter the Most Holy Place : Before he enters , he must offer a bull for a sin offering and a male sheep for a whole burnt offering .
NCV	Leviticus	16	4	He must put on the holy linen inner robe , with the linen underclothes next to his body . His belt will be the cloth belt , and he will wear the linen turban . These are holy clothes , so he must bathe his body in water before he puts them on .
NCV	Leviticus	16	5	“ Aaron must take from the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one male sheep for a burnt offering .
NCV	Leviticus	16	6	Then he will offer the bull for the sin offering for himself to remove sins from him and his family so they will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	16	7	“ Next Aaron will take the two goats and bring them before the Lord at the entrance to the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Leviticus	16	8	He will throw lots for the two goats—one will be for the Lord and the other for the goat that removes sin .
NCV	Leviticus	16	9	Then Aaron will take the goat that was chosen for the Lord by throwing the lot , and he will offer it as a sin offering .
NCV	Leviticus	16	10	The other goat , which was chosen by lot to remove the sin , must be brought alive before the Lord . The priest will use it to perform the acts that remove Israel ’ s sin so they will belong to the Lord . Then this goat will be sent out into the desert as a goat that removes sin .
NCV	Leviticus	16	11	“ Then Aaron will offer the bull as a sin offering for himself , to remove the sins from him and his family so they will belong to the Lord ; he will kill the bull for the sin offering for himself .
NCV	Leviticus	16	12	Then he must take a pan full of burning coals from the altar before the Lord and two handfuls of sweet incense that has been ground into powder . He must bring it into the room behind the curtain .
NCV	Leviticus	16	13	He must put the incense on the fire before the Lord so that the cloud of incense will cover the lid on the Ark . Then when Aaron comes in , he will not die .
NCV	Leviticus	16	14	Also , he must take some of the blood from the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the lid ; with his finger he will sprinkle the blood seven times in front of the lid .
NCV	Leviticus	16	15	“ Then Aaron must kill the goat of the sin offering for the people and bring its blood into the room behind the curtain . He must do with the goat ’ s blood as he did with the bull ’ s blood , sprinkling it on the lid and in front of the lid .
NCV	Leviticus	16	17	When Aaron makes the Most Holy Place ready for service to the Lord , no one is allowed in the Meeting Tent until he comes out . So Aaron will perform the acts to remove sins from himself , his family , and all the people of Israel , so they will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	16	18	Afterward he will go out to the altar that is before the Lord and will make it ready for service to the Lord . Aaron will take some of the bull ’ s blood and some of the goat ’ s blood and put it on the corners of the altar on all sides .
NCV	Leviticus	16	19	Then , with his finger , he will sprinkle some of the blood on the altar seven times to make the altar holy for the Lord and clean from all the sins of the Israelites .
NCV	Leviticus	16	20	“ When Aaron has finished making the Most Holy Place , the Meeting Tent , and the altar ready for service to the Lord , he will offer the living goat .
NCV	Leviticus	16	21	He will put both his hands on the head of the living goat , and he will confess over it all the sins and crimes of Israel . In this way Aaron will put the people ’ s sins on the goat ’ s head . Then he will send the goat away into the desert , and a man who has been appointed will lead the goat away .
NCV	Leviticus	16	22	So the goat will carry on itself all the people ’ s sins to a lonely place in the desert . The man who leads the goat will let it loose there .
NCV	Leviticus	16	23	“ Then Aaron will enter the Meeting Tent and take off the linen clothes he had put on before he went into the Most Holy Place ; he must leave these clothes there .
NCV	Leviticus	16	24	He will bathe his body in water in a holy place and put on his regular clothes . Then he will come out and offer the whole burnt offering for himself and for the people , to remove sins from himself and the people so they will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	16	25	Then he will burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar .
NCV	Leviticus	16	26	“ The person who led the goat , the goat to remove sins , into the desert must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water . After that , he may come back into the camp .
NCV	Leviticus	16	27	“ The bull and the goat for the sin offerings , whose blood was brought into the Most Holy Place to make it ready for service to the Lord , must be taken outside the camp ; the animals ’ skins , bodies , and intestines will be burned in the fire .
NCV	Leviticus	16	28	Then the one who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water . After that , he may come back into the camp .
NCV	Leviticus	16	29	“ This law will always continue for you : On the tenth day of the seventh month , you must deny yourself and you must not do any work . The travelers or foreigners living with you must not work either .
NCV	Leviticus	16	30	It is on this day that the priests will make you clean so you will belong to the Lord again . All your sins will be removed .
NCV	Leviticus	16	31	This is a very important day of rest for you , and you must deny yourselves . This law will continue forever .
NCV	Leviticus	16	32	“ The priest appointed to take his father ’ s place , on whom the oil was poured , will perform the acts for making things ready for service to the Lord . He must put on the holy linen clothes
NCV	Leviticus	16	33	and make the Most Holy Place , the Meeting Tent , and the altar ready for service to the Lord . He must also remove the sins of the priests and all the people of Israel so they will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	16	34	That law for removing the sins of the Israelites so they will belong to the Lord will continue forever . You will do these things once a year. ” So they did the things the Lord had commanded Moses . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	17	4	when he should have brought the animal to the entrance of the Meeting Tent as a gift to the Lord in front of the Lord ’ s Holy Tent , he is guilty of killing . He has killed , and he must be cut off from the people .
NCV	Leviticus	17	5	This rule is so people will bring their sacrifices , which they have been sacrificing in the open fields , to the Lord . They must bring those animals to the Lord at the entrance of the Meeting Tent ; they must bring them to the priest and offer them as fellowship offerings .
NCV	Leviticus	17	6	Then the priest will sprinkle the blood from those animals on the Lord ’ s altar near the entrance of the Meeting Tent . And he will burn the fat from those animals on the altar , as a smell pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	17	7	They must not offer any more sacrifices to their goat idols , which they have chased like prostitutes . These rules will continue for people from now on. ’
NCV	Leviticus	17	8	“ Tell the people this : ‘ If any citizen of Israel or foreigner living with you offers a burnt offering or sacrifice ,
NCV	Leviticus	17	9	that person must take his sacrifice to the entrance of the Meeting Tent to offer it to the Lord . If he does not do this , he must be cut off from the people .
NCV	Leviticus	17	10	“ ‘ I will be against any citizen of Israel or foreigner living with you who eats blood . I will cut off that person from the people .
NCV	Leviticus	17	11	This is because the life of the body is in the blood , and I have given you rules for pouring that blood on the altar to remove your sins so you will belong to the Lord . It is the blood that removes the sins , because it is life .
NCV	Leviticus	17	12	So I tell the people of Israel this : “ None of you may eat blood , and no foreigner living among you may eat blood. ”
NCV	Leviticus	17	13	“ ‘ If any citizen of Israel or foreigner living among you catches a wild animal or bird that can be eaten , that person must pour the blood on the ground and cover it with dirt .
NCV	Leviticus	17	14	If blood is still in the meat , the animal ’ s life is still in it . So I give this command to the people of Israel : “ Don ’ t eat meat that still has blood in it , because the animal ’ s life is in its blood . Anyone who eats blood must be cut off. ”
NCV	Leviticus	17	15	“ ‘ If a person , either a citizen or a foreigner , eats an animal that died by itself or was killed by another animal , he must wash his clothes and bathe in water . He will be unclean until evening ; then he will be clean .

NCV	Leviticus	21	7	“ ‘ A priest must not marry an unclean prostitute or a divorced woman , because he is holy to his God .
NCV	Leviticus	21	8	Treat him as holy , because he offers up the food of your God . Think of him as holy ; I am the Lord who makes you holy , and I am holy .
NCV	Leviticus	21	9	“ ‘ If a priest ’ s daughter makes herself unclean by becoming a prostitute , she shames her father . She must be burned with fire .
NCV	Leviticus	21	10	“ ‘ The high priest , who was chosen from among his brothers , had the special olive oil poured on his head . He was also appointed to wear the priestly clothes . So he must not show his sadness by letting his hair go uncombed or tearing his clothes .
NCV	Leviticus	21	11	He must not go into a house where there is a dead body . He must not make himself unclean , even if it is for his own father or mother .
NCV	Leviticus	21	12	The high priest must not go out of the Holy Place , because if he does and becomes unclean , he will make God ’ s Holy Place unclean . The special oil used in appointing priests was poured on his head to separate him from the rest of the people . I am the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	21	13	“ ‘ The high priest must marry a woman who is a virgin .
NCV	Leviticus	21	14	He must not marry a widow , a divorced woman , or a prostitute . He must marry a virgin from his own people

NCV	Leviticus	21	16	The Lord said to Moses ,

NCV	Leviticus	22	22	You must not offer to the Lord any animal that is blind , that has broken bones or is crippled , that has running sores or any sort of skin disease . You must not offer any animals like these on the altar as an offering by fire to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	2	“ Tell Aaron and his sons : ‘ The people of Israel will give offerings to me . These offerings are holy , and they are mine , so you must respect them to show that you respect my holy name . I am the Lord. ’
NCV	Leviticus	22	3	Say to them : ‘ If any one of your descendants from now on is unclean and comes near the offerings that the Israelites made holy for me , that person must be cut off from appearing before me . I am the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	4	“ ‘ If one of Aaron ’ s descendants has a harmful skin disease , or if he discharges a body fluid , he can not eat the holy offerings until he becomes clean . He could also become unclean from touching a dead body , from his own semen , [ a ]
NCV	Leviticus	22	5	from touching any unclean crawling animal , or from touching an unclean person ( no matter what made the person unclean ) .
NCV	Leviticus	22	6	Anyone who touches those things will become unclean until evening . That person must not eat the holy offerings unless he washes with water .
NCV	Leviticus	22	7	He will be clean only after the sun goes down . Then he may eat the holy offerings ; the offerings are his food .
NCV	Leviticus	22	8	“ ‘ If a priest finds an animal that died by itself or that was killed by some other animal , he must not eat it . If he does , he will become unclean . I am the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	9	“ ‘ If the priests keep all the rules I have given , they will not become guilty ; if they are careful , they will not die . I am the Lord who has made them holy .
NCV	Leviticus	22	10	Only people in a priest ’ s family may eat the holy offering . A visitor staying with the priest or a hired worker must not eat it .
NCV	Leviticus	22	11	But if the priest buys a slave with his own money , that slave may eat the holy offerings ; slaves who were born in his house may also eat his food .
NCV	Leviticus	22	12	If a priest ’ s daughter marries a person who is not a priest , she must not eat any of the holy offerings .
NCV	Leviticus	22	13	But if the priest ’ s daughter becomes widowed or divorced , with no children to support her , and if she goes back to her father ’ s house where she lived as a child , she may eat some of her father ’ s food . But only people from a priest ’ s family may eat this food .
NCV	Leviticus	22	14	“ ‘ If someone eats some of the holy offering by mistake , that person must pay back the priest for that holy food , adding another one-fifth of the price of that food .
NCV	Leviticus	22	15	“ ‘ When the Israelites give their holy offerings to the Lord , the priest must not treat these holy things as though they were not holy .
NCV	Leviticus	22	16	The priests must not allow those who are not priests to eat the holy offerings . If they do , they cause the ones who eat the holy offerings to become guilty , and they will have to pay for it . I am the Lord , who makes them holy. ’ ”
NCV	Leviticus	22	17	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	22	18	“ Tell Aaron and his sons and all the people of Israel : ‘ A citizen of Israel or a foreigner living in Israel might want to bring a whole burnt offering , either for some special promise he has made or for a special gift he wants to give to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	19	If he does , he must bring a male animal that has nothing wrong with it—a bull , a sheep , or a goat—so it might be accepted for him .
NCV	Leviticus	22	20	He must not bring an animal that has something wrong with it , or it will not be accepted for him .
NCV	Leviticus	22	21	“ ‘ If someone brings a fellowship offering to the Lord , either as payment for a special promise the person has made or as a special gift the person wants to give the Lord , it might be from the herd or from the flock . But it must be healthy , with nothing wrong with it , so that it will be accepted .
NCV	Leviticus	22	23	“ ‘ If an ox or lamb is smaller than normal or is not perfectly formed , you may give it as a special gift to the Lord ; it will be accepted . But it will not be accepted as payment for a special promise you have made .
NCV	Leviticus	22	24	“ ‘ If an animal has bruised , crushed , torn , or cut sex glands , you must not offer it to the Lord . You must not do this in your own land ,
NCV	Leviticus	22	25	and you must not take such animals from foreigners as sacrifices to the Lord . Because the animals have been hurt in some way and have something wrong with them , they will not be accepted for you. ’ ”
NCV	Leviticus	22	26	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	22	27	“ When an ox , a sheep , or a goat is born , it must stay seven days with its mother . But from the eighth day on , this animal will be accepted as a sacrifice by fire to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	28	But you must not kill the animal and its mother on the same day , either an ox or a sheep .
NCV	Leviticus	22	29	“ If you want to offer some special offering of thanks to the Lord , you must do it in a way that pleases him .
NCV	Leviticus	22	30	You must eat the whole animal that same day and not leave any of the meat for the next morning . I am the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	31	“ Remember my commands and obey them ; I am the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	22	32	Show respect for my holy name . You Israelites must remember that I am holy ; I am the Lord , who has made you holy .
NCV	Leviticus	22	33	I brought you out of Egypt to be your God . I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - 22:4 semen A man ’ s body fluid by which he can make a woman pregnant . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	23	9	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	23	10	“ Tell the people of Israel : ‘ You will enter the land I will give you and gather its harvest . At that time you must bring the first bundle of grain from your harvest to the priest .
NCV	Leviticus	23	11	The priest will present the bundle before the Lord , and it will be accepted for you ; he will present the bundle on the day after the Sabbath .
NCV	Leviticus	23	12	“ ‘ On the day when you present the bundle of grain , offer a male lamb , one year old , that has nothing wrong with it , as a burnt offering to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	23	13	You must also offer a grain offering—four quarts of fine flour mixed with olive oil as an offering made by fire to the Lord ; its smell will be pleasing to him . You must also offer a quart of wine as a drink offering .
NCV	Leviticus	23	14	Until the day you bring your offering to your God , do not eat any new grain , roasted grain , or bread made from new grain . This law will always continue for people from now on , wherever you live . The Feast of Weeks
NCV	Leviticus	23	15	“ ‘ Count seven full weeks from the morning after the Sabbath . ( This is the Sabbath that you bring the bundle of grain to present as an offering . )
NCV	Leviticus	23	16	On the fiftieth day , the first day after the seventh week , you will bring a new grain offering to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	23	17	On that day bring two loaves of bread from your homes to be presented as an offering . Use yeast and four quarts of flour to make those loaves of bread ; they will be your gift to the Lord from the first wheat of your harvest .
NCV	Leviticus	23	18	“ ‘ Offer with the bread one young bull , two male sheep , and seven male lambs that are one year old and have nothing wrong with them . Offer them with their grain offerings and drink offerings , as a burnt offering to the Lord . They will be an offering made by fire , and the smell will be pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	23	19	You must also offer one male goat for a sin offering and two male , one-year-old lambs as a fellowship offering .
NCV	Leviticus	23	20	“ ‘ The priest will present the two lambs as an offering before the Lord , along with the bread from the first wheat of the harvest . They are holy to the Lord , and they will belong to the priest .
NCV	Leviticus	23	21	On that same day you will call a holy meeting ; you must not do any work that day . This law will continue for you from now on , wherever you live .
NCV	Leviticus	23	22	“ ‘ When you harvest your crops on your land , do not harvest all the way to the corners of your field . If grain falls onto the ground , don ’ t gather it up . Leave it for poor people and foreigners in your country . I am the Lord your God. ’ ” The Feast of Trumpets
NCV	Leviticus	23	24	“ Tell the people of Israel : ‘ On the first day of the seventh month you must have a special day of rest , a holy meeting , when you blow the trumpet for a special time of remembering .
NCV	Leviticus	23	25	Do not do any work , and bring an offering made by fire to the Lord. ’ ” The Day of Cleansing
NCV	Leviticus	23	26	The Lord said to Moses ,

NCV	Leviticus	23	28	Do not do any work on that day , because it is the Day of Cleansing . On that day the priests will go before the Lord and perform the acts to make you clean from sin so you will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	23	29	“ Anyone who refuses to give up food on this day must be cut off from the people .
NCV	Leviticus	23	30	If anyone works on this day , I will destroy that person from among the people .

NCV	Leviticus	24	3	Aaron will keep the lamps burning in the Meeting Tent from evening until morning before the Lord ; this is in front of the curtain of the Ark of the Agreement . This law will continue from now on .

NCV	Leviticus	24	6	Put them in two rows on the golden table before the Lord , six loaves in each row .
NCV	Leviticus	24	7	Put pure incense on each row as the memorial portion to take the place of the bread . It is an offering made by fire to the Lord .

NCV	Leviticus	24	9	That bread will belong to Aaron and his sons . They will eat it in a holy place , because it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the Lord . That bread is their share forever. ” The Man Who Cursed God
NCV	Leviticus	24	10	Now there was a son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian father who was walking among the Israelites . A fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite .
NCV	Leviticus	24	11	The son of the Israelite woman began cursing and speaking against the Lord , so the people took him to Moses . ( The mother ’ s name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri from the family of Dan . )
NCV	Leviticus	24	12	The people held him as a prisoner while they waited for the Lord ’ s command to be made clear to them .
NCV	Leviticus	24	13	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Leviticus	24	14	“ Take the one who spoke against me outside the camp . Then all the people who heard him must put their hands on his head , and all the people must throw stones at him and kill him .
NCV	Leviticus	24	15	Tell the people of Israel this : ‘ If anyone curses his God , he is guilty of sin .
NCV	Leviticus	24	16	Anyone who speaks against the Lord must be put to death ; all the people must kill him by throwing stones at him . Foreigners must be punished just like the people born in Israel ; if they speak against the Lord , they must be put to death .
NCV	Leviticus	24	17	“ ‘ Whoever kills another person must be put to death .
NCV	Leviticus	24	18	Whoever kills an animal that belongs to another person must give that person another animal to take its place .
NCV	Leviticus	24	19	And whoever causes an injury to a neighbor must receive the same kind of injury in return :
NCV	Leviticus	24	20	Broken bone for broken bone , eye for eye , tooth for tooth . Anyone who injures another person must be injured in the same way in return .
NCV	Leviticus	24	21	Whoever kills another person ’ s animal must give that person another animal to take its place . But whoever kills another person must be put to death .

NCV	Leviticus	25	25	If a person in your country becomes very poor and sells some land , then close relatives must come and buy it back .
NCV	Leviticus	25	2	“ Tell the people of Israel this : ‘ When you enter the land I will give you , let it have a special time of rest , to honor the Lord .
NCV	Leviticus	25	3	You may plant seed in your field for six years , and you may trim your vineyards for six years and bring in their fruits .
NCV	Leviticus	25	4	But during the seventh year , you must let the land rest . This will be a special time to honor the Lord . You must not plant seed in your field or trim your vineyards .
NCV	Leviticus	25	5	You must not cut the crops that grow by themselves after harvest , or gather the grapes from your vines that are not trimmed . The land will have a year of rest .
NCV	Leviticus	25	6	“ ‘ You may eat whatever the land produces during that year of rest . It will be food for your men and women servants , for your hired workers , and for the foreigners living in your country .
NCV	Leviticus	25	7	It will also be food for your cattle and the wild animals of your land . Whatever the land produces may be eaten . The Year of Jubilee
NCV	Leviticus	25	8	“ ‘ Count off seven groups of seven years , or forty-nine years . During that time there will be seven years of rest for the land .
NCV	Leviticus	25	9	On the Day of Cleansing , you must blow the horn of a male sheep ; this will be on the tenth day of the seventh month . You must blow the horn through the whole country .
NCV	Leviticus	25	10	Make the fiftieth year a special year , and announce freedom for all the people living in your country . This time will be called Jubilee . [ a ] You will each go back to your own property , each to your own family and family group .
NCV	Leviticus	25	11	The fiftieth year will be a special time for you to celebrate . Don ’ t plant seeds , or harvest the crops that grow by themselves , or gather grapes from the vines that are not trimmed .
NCV	Leviticus	25	12	That year is Jubilee ; it will be a holy time for you . You may eat only the crops that come from the field .
NCV	Leviticus	25	13	In the year of Jubilee you each must go back to your own property .
NCV	Leviticus	25	14	“ ‘ If you sell your land to your neighbor , or if you buy land from your neighbor , don ’ t cheat each other .
NCV	Leviticus	25	15	If you want to buy your neighbor ’ s land , count the number of years since the last Jubilee , and use that number to decide the right price . If your neighbor sells the land to you , count the number of years left for harvesting crops , and use that number to decide the right price .
NCV	Leviticus	25	16	If there are many years , the price will be high . But if there are only a few years , lower the price , because your neighbor is really selling only a few crops to you .
NCV	Leviticus	25	17	You must not cheat each other , but you must respect your God . I am the Lord your God .
NCV	Leviticus	25	18	“ ‘ Remember my laws and rules , and obey them so that you will live safely in the land .
NCV	Leviticus	25	19	The land will give good crops to you , and you will eat as much as you want and live safely in the land .
NCV	Leviticus	25	20	“ ‘ But you might ask , “ If we don ’ t plant seeds or gather crops , what will we eat the seventh year ? ”
NCV	Leviticus	25	21	I will send you such a great blessing during the sixth year that the land will produce enough crops for three years .
NCV	Leviticus	25	22	When you plant in the eighth year , you will still be eating from the old crop ; you will eat the old crop until the harvest of the ninth year . Property Laws
NCV	Leviticus	25	23	“ ‘ The land really belongs to me , so you can ’ t sell it for all time . You are only foreigners and travelers living for a while on my land .
NCV	Leviticus	25	24	People might sell their land , but it must always be possible for the family to get its land back .
NCV	Leviticus	25	26	If there is not a close relative to buy the land back , but if the person makes enough money to be able to buy it back ,
NCV	Leviticus	25	27	the years must be counted since the land was sold . That number must be used to decide how much the first owner should pay back the one who bought it . Then the land will belong to the first owner again .
NCV	Leviticus	25	28	But if there is not enough money to buy it back , the one who bought it will keep it until the year of Jubilee . During that celebration , the land will go back to the first owner ’ s family .
NCV	Leviticus	25	29	“ ‘ If someone sells a home in a walled city , for a full year after it is sold , the person has the right to buy it back .
NCV	Leviticus	25	30	But if the owner does not buy back the house before a full year is over , it will belong to the one who bought it and to his future sons . The house will not go back to the first owner at Jubilee .
NCV	Leviticus	25	31	But houses in small towns without walls are like open country ; they can be bought back , and they must be returned to their first owner at Jubilee .
NCV	Leviticus	25	32	“ ‘ The Levites may always buy back their houses in the cities that belong to them .
NCV	Leviticus	25	33	If someone buys a house from a Levite , that house in the Levites ’ city will again belong to the Levites in the Jubilee . This is because houses in Levite cities belong to the people of Levi ; the Israelites gave these cities to them .
NCV	Leviticus	25	34	Also the fields and pastures around the Levites ’ cities can not be sold , because those fields belong to the Levites forever . Rules for Slave Owners
NCV	Leviticus	25	35	“ ‘ If anyone from your country becomes too poor to support himself , help him to live among you as you would a stranger or foreigner .
NCV	Leviticus	25	36	Do not charge him any interest on money you loan to him , but respect your God ; let the poor live among you .
NCV	Leviticus	25	37	Don ’ t lend him money for interest , and don ’ t try to make a profit from the food he buys .
NCV	Leviticus	25	38	I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give the land of Canaan to you and to become your God .
NCV	Leviticus	25	39	“ ‘ If anyone from your country becomes very poor and sells himself as a slave to you , you must not make him work like a slave .
NCV	Leviticus	25	40	He will be like a hired worker and a visitor with you until the year of Jubilee .
NCV	Leviticus	25	41	Then he may leave you , take his children , and go back to his family and the land of his ancestors .
NCV	Leviticus	25	42	This is because the Israelites are my servants , and I brought them out of slavery in Egypt . They must not become slaves again .
NCV	Leviticus	25	43	You must not rule this person cruelly , but you must respect your God .
NCV	Leviticus	25	44	“ ‘ Your men and women slaves must come from other nations around you ; from them you may buy slaves .
NCV	Leviticus	25	45	Also you may buy as slaves children from the families of foreigners living in your land . These child slaves will belong to you ,
NCV	Leviticus	25	46	and you may even pass them on to your children after you die ; you can make them slaves forever . But you must not rule cruelly over your own people , the Israelites .
NCV	Leviticus	25	47	“ ‘ Suppose a foreigner or visitor among you becomes rich . If someone in your country becomes so poor that he has to sell himself as a slave to the foreigner living among you or to a member of the foreigner ’ s family ,
NCV	Leviticus	25	48	the poor person has the right to be bought back and become free . One of his relatives may buy him back :
NCV	Leviticus	25	49	His uncle , his uncle ’ s son , or any one of his close relatives may buy him back . Or , if he gets enough money , he may pay the money to free himself .
NCV	Leviticus	25	50	“ ‘ He and the one who bought him must count the time from when he sold himself up to the next year of Jubilee . Use that number to decide the price , because the person really only hired himself out for a certain number of years .
NCV	Leviticus	25	51	If there are still many years before the year of Jubilee , the person must pay back a large part of the price .
NCV	Leviticus	25	52	If there are only a few years left until Jubilee , the person must pay a small part of the first price .
NCV	Leviticus	25	53	But he will live like a hired person with the foreigner every year ; don ’ t let the foreigner rule cruelly over him .
NCV	Leviticus	25	54	“ ‘ Even if no one buys him back , at the year of Jubilee , he and his children will become free .
NCV	Leviticus	25	55	This is because the people of Israel are servants to me . They are my servants , whom I brought out of Egypt . I am the Lord your God . Footnotes - 25:10 Jubilee This word comes from the Hebrew word for a horn of a male sheep . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Leviticus	26	16	As a result , I will do this to you : I will cause terrible things to happen to you . I will cause you to have disease and fever that will destroy your eyes and slowly kill you . You will not have success when you plant your seed , and your enemy will eat your crops .
NCV	Leviticus	26	17	I will be against you , and your enemies will defeat you . These people who hate you will rule over you , and you will run away even when no one is chasing you .
NCV	Leviticus	26	18	“ ‘ If after all this you still do not obey me , I will punish you seven times more for your sins .

NCV	Leviticus	26	22	I will send wild animals to attack you , and they will take your children away from you and destroy your cattle . They will make you so few in number the roads will be empty .
NCV	Leviticus	26	23	“ ‘ If you don ’ t learn your lesson after all these things , and if you still turn against me ,
NCV	Leviticus	26	24	I will also turn against you . I will punish you seven more times for your sins .
NCV	Leviticus	26	25	You broke my agreement , and I will punish you . I will bring armies against you , and if you go into your cities for safety , I will cause diseases to spread among you so that your enemy will defeat you .

NCV	Leviticus	26	28	I will show my great anger ; I will punish you seven more times for your sins .
NCV	Leviticus	26	29	You will eat the bodies of your sons and daughters .
NCV	Leviticus	26	30	I will destroy your places where gods are worshiped and cut down your incense altars . I will pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols . I will hate you .
NCV	Leviticus	26	31	I will destroy your cities and make your holy places empty , and I will not smell the pleasing smell of your offerings .
NCV	Leviticus	26	32	I will make the land empty so that your enemies who come to live in it will be shocked at it .
NCV	Leviticus	26	33	I will scatter you among the nations , and I will pull out my sword and destroy you . Your land will become empty , your cities a waste .
NCV	Leviticus	26	34	When you are taken to your enemy ’ s country , your land will finally get its rest . It will enjoy its time of rest all the time it lies empty .
NCV	Leviticus	26	35	During the time the land is empty , it will have the rest you should have given it while you lived in it .
NCV	Leviticus	26	36	“ ‘ Those of you who are left alive will lose their courage in the land of their enemies . They will be frightened by the sound of a leaf being blown by the wind . They will run as if someone were chasing them with a sword , and they will fall even when no one is chasing them .
NCV	Leviticus	26	37	They will fall over each other , as if someone were chasing them with a sword , even though no one is chasing them . You will not be strong enough to stand up against your enemies .
NCV	Leviticus	26	38	You will die among other nations and disappear in your enemies ’ countries .
NCV	Leviticus	26	39	So those who are left alive will rot away in their enemies ’ countries because of their sins . They will also rot away because of their ancestors ’ sins . There Is Always Hope
NCV	Leviticus	26	40	“ ‘ But maybe the people will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors ; maybe they will admit they turned against me and sinned against me ,
NCV	Leviticus	26	41	which made me turn against them and send them into the land of their enemies . If these disobedient people are sorry for what they did and accept punishment for their sin ,
NCV	Leviticus	26	42	I will remember my agreement with Jacob , my agreement with Isaac , and my agreement with Abraham , and I will remember the land .
NCV	Leviticus	26	43	The land will be left empty by its people , and it will enjoy its time of rest as it lies bare without them . Then those who are left alive will accept the punishment for their sins . They will learn that they were punished because they hated my laws and refused to obey my rules .
NCV	Leviticus	26	44	But even though this is true , I will not turn away from them when they are in the land of their enemies . I will not hate them so much that I completely destroy them and break my agreement with them , because I am the Lord their God .
NCV	Leviticus	26	45	For their good I will remember the agreement with their ancestors , whom I brought out of the land of Egypt so I could become their God ; the other nations saw these things . I am the Lord. ’ ”

NCV	Leviticus	27	2	“ Speak to the people of Israel and tell them : ‘ If someone makes a special promise to give a person as a servant to the Lord by paying a price that is the same value as that person ,

NCV	Numbers	5	5	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	5	2	“ Command the Israelites to send away from camp anyone with a harmful skin disease . Send away anyone who gives off body fluid or who has become unclean by touching a dead body .
NCV	Numbers	5	3	Send both men and women outside the camp so that they won ’ t spread the disease there , where I am living among you. ”
NCV	Numbers	5	4	So Israel obeyed the Lord ’ s command and sent those people outside the camp . They did just as the Lord had told Moses . Paying for Doing Wrong
NCV	Numbers	5	6	“ Tell the Israelites : ‘ When a man or woman does something wrong to another person , that is really sinning against the Lord . That person is guilty
NCV	Numbers	5	7	and must admit the wrong that has been done . The person must fully pay for the wrong that has been done , adding one-fifth to it , and giving it to the person who was wronged .
NCV	Numbers	5	8	But if that person is dead and does not have any close relatives to receive the payment , the one who did wrong owes the Lord and must pay the priest . In addition , the priest must sacrifice a male sheep to remove the wrong so that the person will belong to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	5	9	When an Israelite brings a holy gift , it should be given to the priest .
NCV	Numbers	5	10	No one has to give these holy gifts , but if someone does give them , they belong to the priest. ’ ” Suspicious Husbands
NCV	Numbers	5	11	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	5	12	“ Tell the Israelites : ‘ A man ’ s wife might be unfaithful to him
NCV	Numbers	5	13	and have sexual relations with another man . Her sin might be kept hidden from her husband so that he does not know about the wrong she did . Perhaps no one saw it , and she wasn ’ t caught .
NCV	Numbers	5	14	But if her husband has feelings of jealousy and suspects she has sinned—whether she has or not—
NCV	Numbers	5	15	he should take her to the priest . The husband must also take an offering for her of two quarts of barley flour . He must not pour oil or incense on it , because this is a grain offering for jealousy , an offering of remembrance . It is to find out if she is guilty .
NCV	Numbers	5	16	“ ‘ The priest will bring in the woman and make her stand before the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	5	17	He will take some holy water in a clay jar , and he will put some dirt from the floor of the Holy Tent into the water .
NCV	Numbers	5	18	The priest will make the woman stand before the Lord , and he will loosen her hair . He will hand her the offering of remembrance , the grain offering for jealousy ; he will hold the bitter water that brings a curse .
NCV	Numbers	5	19	The priest will make her take an oath and ask her , “ Has another man had sexual relations with you ? Have you been unfaithful to your husband ? If you haven ’ t , this bitter water that brings a curse won ’ t hurt you .
NCV	Numbers	5	20	But if you have been unfaithful to your husband and have had sexual relations with a man besides him ” —
NCV	Numbers	5	21	the priest will then put on her the curse that the oath will bring— “ the Lord will make the people curse and reject you . He will make your stomach get big , and he will make your body unable to give birth to another baby .
NCV	Numbers	5	22	This water that brings a curse will go inside you and make your body unable to give birth to another baby. ” “ ‘ The woman must say , “ I agree. ”
NCV	Numbers	5	23	“ ‘ The priest should write these curses on a scroll , wash the words off into the bitter water ,
NCV	Numbers	5	24	and make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse . If she is guilty , the water will make her sick .
NCV	Numbers	5	25	Then the priest will take the grain offering for jealousy from her . He will present it before the Lord and bring it to the altar .
NCV	Numbers	5	26	He will take a handful of the grain , which is a memorial offering , and burn it on the altar . After that he will make the woman drink the water
NCV	Numbers	5	27	to see if she is not pure and if she has sinned against her husband . When it goes into her , if her stomach gets big and she is not able to have another baby , her people will reject her .
NCV	Numbers	5	28	But if the woman has not sinned , she is pure . She is not guilty , and she will be able to have babies .
NCV	Numbers	5	29	“ ‘ So this is the teaching about jealousy . This is what to do when a woman does wrong and is unfaithful while she is married to her husband .
NCV	Numbers	5	30	It also should be done if the man gets jealous because he suspects his wife . The priest will have her stand before the Lord , and he will do all these things , just as the teaching commands .
NCV	Numbers	5	31	In this way the husband can be proven correct , and the woman will suffer if she has done wrong. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	6	11	The priest will offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering . This removes sin so they will belong to the Lord . ( They had sinned because they were near a dead body . ) That same day they will again promise to let their hair grow

NCV	Numbers	8	13	Make the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and present the Levites as an offering to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	8	14	In this way you must set apart the Levites from the other Israelites ; the Levites will be mine .

NCV	Numbers	8	16	They will be given completely to me from the Israelites ; I have taken them for myself instead of the firstborn of every Israelite woman .
NCV	Numbers	8	17	All the firstborn in Israel—people or animals—are mine . When I killed all the firstborn in Egypt , I set the firstborn in Israel aside for myself .
NCV	Numbers	8	18	But I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn in Israel .
NCV	Numbers	8	19	From all the Israelites I have given the Levites to Aaron and his sons so that they may serve the Israelites at the Meeting Tent .

NCV	Numbers	8	21	The Levites made themselves clean and washed their clothes . Then Aaron presented them as an offering to the Lord . He also removed their sins so they would be pure .

NCV	Numbers	9	3	That appointed time is the fourteenth day of this month at twilight ; they must obey all the rules about it. ”
NCV	Numbers	9	4	So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover ,

NCV	Numbers	10	3	When both trumpets are blown , the people should gather before you at the entrance to the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	10	4	If you blow only one trumpet , the leaders , the heads of the family groups of Israel , should meet before you .
NCV	Numbers	10	5	When you loudly blow the trumpets , the tribes camping on the east should move .
NCV	Numbers	10	6	When you loudly blow them again , the tribes camping on the south should move ; the loud sound will tell them to move .
NCV	Numbers	10	7	When you want to gather the people , blow the trumpets , but don ’ t blow them as loudly .
NCV	Numbers	10	8	“ Aaron ’ s sons , the priests , should blow the trumpets . This is a law for you and your descendants from now on .
NCV	Numbers	10	9	When you are fighting an enemy who attacks you in your own land , blow the trumpets loudly . The Lord your God will take notice of you and will save you from your enemies .
NCV	Numbers	10	11	The cloud lifted from the Tent of the Agreement on the twentieth day of the second month of the second year .
NCV	Numbers	10	12	So the Israelites moved from the Desert of Sinai and continued until the cloud stopped in the Desert of Paran .
NCV	Numbers	10	13	This was their first time to move , and they did it as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Numbers	10	14	The divisions from the camp of Judah moved first under their flag . Nahshon son of Amminadab was the commander .
NCV	Numbers	10	15	Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar .
NCV	Numbers	10	16	Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun .
NCV	Numbers	10	17	Then the Holy Tent was taken down , and the Gershonites and Merarites , who carried it , moved next .
NCV	Numbers	10	18	Then came the divisions from the camp of Reuben under their flag , and Elizur son of Shedeur was the commander .
NCV	Numbers	10	19	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon .
NCV	Numbers	10	20	Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad .
NCV	Numbers	10	21	Then came the Kohathites , who carried the holy things ; the Holy Tent was to be set up before they arrived .
NCV	Numbers	10	22	Next came the divisions from the camp of Ephraim under their flag , and Elishama son of Ammihud was the commander .
NCV	Numbers	10	23	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh ,
NCV	Numbers	10	24	and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin .
NCV	Numbers	10	25	The last ones were the rear guard for all the tribes . These were the divisions from the camp of Dan under their flag , and Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was the commander .
NCV	Numbers	10	26	Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher ;
NCV	Numbers	10	27	Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali .
NCV	Numbers	10	28	This was the order the Israelite divisions marched in when they moved .
NCV	Numbers	10	29	Hobab was the son of Reuel the Midianite , [ a ] who was Moses ’ father-in-law . Moses said to Hobab , “ We are moving to the land the Lord promised to give us . Come with us and we will be good to you , because the Lord has promised good things to Israel. ”
NCV	Numbers	10	30	But Hobab answered , “ No , I will not go . I will go back to my own land where I was born. ”
NCV	Numbers	10	31	But Moses said , “ Please don ’ t leave us . You know where we can camp in the desert , and you can be our guide .
NCV	Numbers	10	32	Come with us . We will share with you all the good things the Lord gives us. ”
NCV	Numbers	10	33	So they left the mountain of the Lord and traveled for three days . The Ark of the Lord ’ s Agreement went in front of the people for those three days , as they looked for a place to camp .
NCV	Numbers	10	34	The Lord ’ s cloud was over them during the day when they left their camp .
NCV	Numbers	10	35	When the Ark left the camp , Moses said , “ Rise up , Lord ! Scatter your enemies : make those who hate you run from you. ”
NCV	Numbers	10	36	And when the Ark was set down , Moses said , “ Return , Lord , to the thousands of people of Israel. ” Footnotes - 10:29 Reuel the Midianite Also called Jethro . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	11	11	He asked the Lord , “ Why have you brought me , your servant , this trouble ? What have I done wrong that you made me responsible for all these people ?
NCV	Numbers	11	2	The people cried out to Moses , and when he prayed to the Lord , the fire stopped burning .
NCV	Numbers	11	3	So that place was called Taberah , [ a ] because the Lord ’ s fire had burned among them . Seventy Elders Help Moses
NCV	Numbers	11	4	Some troublemakers among them wanted better food , and soon all the Israelites began complaining . They said , “ We want meat !
NCV	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish we ate for free in Egypt . We also had cucumbers , melons , leeks , onions , and garlic .
NCV	Numbers	11	6	But now we have lost our appetite ; we never see anything but this manna ! ”
NCV	Numbers	11	7	The manna was like small white seeds .
NCV	Numbers	11	8	The people would go to gather it , and then grind it in handmills , or crush it between stones . After they cooked it in a pot or made cakes with it , it tasted like bread baked with olive oil .
NCV	Numbers	11	9	When the dew fell on the camp each night , so did the manna .
NCV	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard every family crying as they stood in the entrances of their tents . Then the Lord became very angry , and Moses got upset .
NCV	Numbers	11	12	I am not the father of all these people , and I didn ’ t give birth to them . So why do you make me carry them to the land you promised to our ancestors ? Must I carry them in my arms as a nurse carries a baby ?
NCV	Numbers	11	13	Where can I get meat for all these people ? They keep crying to me , ‘ We want meat ! ’
NCV	Numbers	11	14	I can ’ t take care of all these people alone . It is too much for me .
NCV	Numbers	11	15	If you are going to continue doing this to me , then kill me now . If you care about me , put me to death , and then I won ’ t have any more troubles. ”
NCV	Numbers	11	16	The Lord said to Moses , “ Bring me seventy of Israel ’ s elders , men that you know are leaders among the people . Bring them to the Meeting Tent , and have them stand there with you .
NCV	Numbers	11	17	I will come down and speak with you there . I will take some of the Spirit that is in you , and I will give it to them . They will help you care for the people so that you will not have to care for them alone .
NCV	Numbers	11	18	“ Tell the people this : ‘ Make yourselves holy for tomorrow , and you will eat meat . You cried to the Lord , “ We want meat ! We were better off in Egypt ! ” So now the Lord will give you meat to eat .
NCV	Numbers	11	19	You will eat it not for just one , two , five , ten , or even twenty days ,
NCV	Numbers	11	20	but you will eat that meat for a whole month . You will eat it until it comes out your nose , and you will grow to hate it . This is because you have rejected the Lord , who is with you . You have cried to him , saying , “ Why did we ever leave Egypt ? ” ’ ”
NCV	Numbers	11	21	Moses said , “ Lord , here are six hundred thousand people standing around me , and you say , ‘ I will give them enough meat to eat for a month ! ’
NCV	Numbers	11	22	If we killed all the flocks and herds , that would not be enough . If we caught all the fish in the sea , that would not be enough. ”
NCV	Numbers	11	23	But the Lord said to Moses , “ Do you think I ’ m weak ? Now you will see if I can do what I say. ”
NCV	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out to the people and told them what the Lord had said . He gathered seventy of the elders together and had them stand around the Tent .
NCV	Numbers	11	25	Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses . The Lord took some of the Spirit Moses had , and he gave it to the seventy leaders . With the Spirit in them , they prophesied , but just that one time .
NCV	Numbers	11	26	Two men named Eldad and Medad were also listed as leaders , but they did not go to the Tent . They stayed in the camp , but the Spirit was also given to them , and they prophesied in the camp .
NCV	Numbers	11	27	A young man ran to Moses and said , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. ”
NCV	Numbers	11	28	Joshua son of Nun said , “ Moses , my master , stop them ! ” ( Ever since he was a young boy , Joshua had been Moses ’ assistant . )
NCV	Numbers	11	29	But Moses answered , “ Are you jealous for me ? I wish all the Lord ’ s people could prophesy . I wish the Lord would give his Spirit to all of them ! ”
NCV	Numbers	11	30	Then Moses and the leaders of Israel went back to the camp . The Lord Sends Quail
NCV	Numbers	11	31	The Lord sent a strong wind from the sea , and it blew quail into the area all around the camp . The quail were about three feet deep on the ground , and there were quail a day ’ s walk in any direction .
NCV	Numbers	11	32	The people went out and gathered quail all that day , that night , and the next day . Everyone gathered at least sixty bushels , and they spread them around the camp .
NCV	Numbers	11	33	But the Lord became very angry , and he gave the people a terrible sickness that came while the meat was still in their mouths .
NCV	Numbers	11	34	So the people named that place Kibroth Hattaavah , [ b ] because there they buried those who wanted other food .

NCV	Numbers	12	12	Don ’ t let her be like a baby who is born dead . ( Sometimes a baby is born with half of its flesh eaten away . ) ”
NCV	Numbers	12	2	They said , “ Is Moses the only one the Lord speaks through ? Doesn ’ t he also speak through us ? ” And the Lord heard this .
NCV	Numbers	12	3	( Now Moses was very humble . He was the least proud person on earth . )
NCV	Numbers	12	4	So the Lord suddenly spoke to Moses , Aaron , and Miriam and said , “ All three of you come to the Meeting Tent. ” So they went .
NCV	Numbers	12	5	The Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance to the Tent . He called to Aaron and Miriam , and they both came near .
NCV	Numbers	12	6	He said , “ Listen to my words : When prophets are among you , I , the Lord , will show myself to them in visions ; I will speak to them in dreams .
NCV	Numbers	12	7	But this is not true with my servant Moses . I trust him to lead all my people .
NCV	Numbers	12	8	I speak face to face with him— clearly , not with hidden meanings . He has even seen the form of the Lord . You should be afraid to speak against my servant Moses. ”
NCV	Numbers	12	9	The Lord was very angry with them , and he left .
NCV	Numbers	12	10	When the cloud lifted from the Tent and Aaron turned toward Miriam , she was as white as snow ; she had a skin disease .
NCV	Numbers	12	11	Aaron said to Moses , “ Please , my master , forgive us for our foolish sin .
NCV	Numbers	12	13	So Moses cried out to the Lord , “ God , please heal her ! ”
NCV	Numbers	12	14	The Lord answered Moses , “ If her father had spit in her face , she would have been shamed for seven days , so put her outside the camp for seven days . After that , she may come back. ”
NCV	Numbers	12	15	So Miriam was put outside of the camp for seven days , and the people did not move on until she came back .

NCV	Numbers	13	13	from the tribe of Asher , Sethur son of Michael ;
NCV	Numbers	13	2	“ Send men to explore the land of Canaan , which I will give to the Israelites . Send one leader from each tribe. ”
NCV	Numbers	13	3	So Moses obeyed the Lord ’ s command and sent the Israelite leaders out from the Desert of Paran .
NCV	Numbers	13	4	These are their names : from the tribe of Reuben , Shammua son of Zaccur ;
NCV	Numbers	13	5	from the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat son of Hori ;
NCV	Numbers	13	6	from the tribe of Judah , Caleb son of Jephunneh ;
NCV	Numbers	13	7	from the tribe of Issachar , Igal son of Joseph ;
NCV	Numbers	13	8	from the tribe of Ephraim , Hoshea son of Nun ;
NCV	Numbers	13	9	from the tribe of Benjamin , Palti son of Raphu ;
NCV	Numbers	13	10	from the tribe of Zebulun , Gaddiel son of Sodi ;
NCV	Numbers	13	11	from the tribe of Manasseh ( a tribe of Joseph ) , Gaddi son of Susi ;
NCV	Numbers	13	12	from the tribe of Dan , Ammiel son of Gemalli ;
NCV	Numbers	13	14	from the tribe of Naphtali , Nahbi son of Vophsi ;
NCV	Numbers	13	15	from the tribe of Gad , Geuel son of Maki .
NCV	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land . ( Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the new name Joshua . )
NCV	Numbers	13	17	Moses sent them to explore Canaan and said , “ Go through southern Canaan and then into the mountains .
NCV	Numbers	13	18	See what the land looks like . Are the people who live there strong or weak ? Are there a few or many ?
NCV	Numbers	13	19	What kind of land do they live in ? Is it good or bad ? What about the towns they live in—are they open like camps , or do they have walls ?
NCV	Numbers	13	20	What about the soil ? Is it fertile or poor ? Are there trees there ? Try to bring back some of the fruit from that land. ” ( It was the season for the first grapes . )
NCV	Numbers	13	21	So they went up and explored the land , from the Desert of Zin all the way to Rehob by Lebo Hamath .
NCV	Numbers	13	22	They went through the southern area to Hebron , where Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the descendants of Anak lived . ( The city of Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt . )
NCV	Numbers	13	23	In the Valley of Eshcol , they cut off a branch of a grapevine that had one bunch of grapes on it and carried that branch on a pole between two of them . They also got some pomegranates and figs .
NCV	Numbers	13	24	That place was called the Valley of Eshcol , [ a ] because the Israelites cut off the bunch of grapes there .
NCV	Numbers	13	25	After forty days of exploring the land , the men returned to the camp .
NCV	Numbers	13	26	They came back to Moses and Aaron and all the Israelites at Kadesh , in the Desert of Paran . The men reported to them and showed everybody the fruit from the land .
NCV	Numbers	13	27	They told Moses , “ We went to the land where you sent us , and it is a fertile land ! Here is some of its fruit .
NCV	Numbers	13	28	But the people who live there are strong . Their cities are walled and very large . We even saw some Anakites there .
NCV	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites live in the southern area ; the Hittites , Jebusites , and Amorites live in the mountains ; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan River. ”
NCV	Numbers	13	30	Then Caleb told the people near Moses to be quiet , and he said , “ We should certainly go up and take the land for ourselves . We can certainly do it. ”
NCV	Numbers	13	31	But the men who had gone with him said , “ We can ’ t attack those people ; they are stronger than we are. ”
NCV	Numbers	13	32	And those men gave the Israelites a bad report about the land they explored , saying , “ The land that we explored is too large to conquer . All the people we saw are very tall .
NCV	Numbers	13	33	We saw the Nephilim people there . ( The Anakites come from the Nephilim people . ) We felt like grasshoppers , and we looked like grasshoppers to them. ” Footnotes - 13:24 Eshcol This name in Hebrew means “ bunch. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	14	14	and the Egyptians will tell this to those who live in this land . They have already heard about you , Lord . They know that you are with your people and that you were seen face to face . They know that your cloud stays over your people and that you lead your people with that cloud during the day and with fire at night .
NCV	Numbers	14	2	All the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron , and all the people said to them , “ We wish we had died in Egypt or in this desert .
NCV	Numbers	14	3	Why is the Lord bringing us to this land to be killed with swords ? Our wives and children will be taken away . We would be better off going back to Egypt. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	4	They said to each other , “ Let ’ s choose a leader and go back to Egypt. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron bowed facedown in front of all the Israelites gathered there .
NCV	Numbers	14	6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh , who had explored the land , tore their clothes .
NCV	Numbers	14	7	They said to all of the Israelites , “ The land we explored is very good .
NCV	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord is pleased with us , he will lead us into that land and give us that fertile land .
NCV	Numbers	14	9	Don ’ t turn against the Lord ! Don ’ t be afraid of the people in that land ! We will chew them up . They have no protection , but the Lord is with us . So don ’ t be afraid of them. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	10	Then all the people talked about killing them with stones . But the glory of the Lord appeared at the Meeting Tent to all the Israelites .
NCV	Numbers	14	11	The Lord said to Moses , “ How long will these people ignore me ? How long will they not believe me in spite of the miracles I have done among them ?
NCV	Numbers	14	12	I will give them a terrible sickness and get rid of them . But I will make you into a great nation that will be stronger than they are. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	13	Then Moses said to the Lord , “ The Egyptians will hear about it ! You brought these people from there by your great power ,
NCV	Numbers	14	15	If you put these people to death all at once , the nations who have heard about your power will say ,
NCV	Numbers	14	16	‘ The Lord was not able to bring them into the land he promised them . So he killed them in the desert. ’
NCV	Numbers	14	17	“ So show your strength now , Lord . Do what you said :
NCV	Numbers	14	18	‘ The Lord doesn ’ t become angry quickly , but he has great love . He forgives sin and law breaking . But the Lord never forgets to punish guilty people . When parents sin , he will also punish their children , their grandchildren , their great-grandchildren , and their great-great-grandchildren. ’
NCV	Numbers	14	19	By your great love , forgive these people ’ s sin , just as you have forgiven them from the time they left Egypt until now. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	20	The Lord answered , “ I have forgiven them as you asked .
NCV	Numbers	14	21	But , as surely as I live and as surely as my glory fills the whole earth , I make this promise :
NCV	Numbers	14	22	All these people saw my glory and the miracles I did in Egypt and in the desert , but they disobeyed me and tested me ten times .
NCV	Numbers	14	23	So not one of them will see the land I promised to their ancestors . No one who rejected me will see that land .
NCV	Numbers	14	24	But my servant Caleb thinks differently and follows me completely . So I will bring him into the land he has already seen , and his children will own that land .
NCV	Numbers	14	25	Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys , leave tomorrow and follow the desert road toward the Red Sea. ” The Lord Punishes the People
NCV	Numbers	14	26	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NCV	Numbers	14	27	“ How long will these evil people complain about me ? I have heard the grumbling and complaining of these Israelites .
NCV	Numbers	14	28	So tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord says . I heard what you said , and as surely as I live , I will do those very things to you :
NCV	Numbers	14	29	You will die in this desert . Every one of you who is twenty years old or older and who was counted with the people—all of you who complained against me—will die .
NCV	Numbers	14	30	Not one of you will enter the land where I promised you would live ; only Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun will go in .
NCV	Numbers	14	31	You said that your children would be taken away , but I will bring them into the land to enjoy what you refused .
NCV	Numbers	14	32	As for you , you will die in this desert .
NCV	Numbers	14	33	Your children will be shepherds here for forty years . Because you were not loyal , they will suffer until you lie dead in the desert .
NCV	Numbers	14	34	For forty years you will suffer for your sins—a year for each of the forty days you explored the land . You will know me as your enemy. ’
NCV	Numbers	14	35	I , the Lord , have spoken , and I will certainly do these things to all these evil people who have come together against me . So they will all die here in this desert. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	36	The men Moses had sent to explore the land had returned and spread complaints among all the people . They had given a bad report about the land .
NCV	Numbers	14	37	The men who gave a very bad report died ; the Lord killed them with a terrible sickness .
NCV	Numbers	14	38	Only two of the men who explored the land did not die—Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh .
NCV	Numbers	14	39	When Moses told these things to all the Israelites , they were very sad .
NCV	Numbers	14	40	Early the next morning they started to go toward the top of the mountains , saying , “ We have sinned . We will go where the Lord told us. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	41	But Moses said , “ Why are you disobeying the Lord ’ s command ? You will not win !
NCV	Numbers	14	42	Don ’ t go , because the Lord is not with you and you will be beaten by your enemies .
NCV	Numbers	14	43	You will run into the Amalekites and Canaanites , who will kill you with swords . You have turned away from the Lord , so the Lord will not be with you. ”
NCV	Numbers	14	44	But they were proud . They went toward the top of the mountains , but Moses and the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord did not leave the camp .

NCV	Numbers	15	15	The law is the same for you and for foreigners , and it will be from now on ; you and the foreigners are alike before the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	15	2	“ Speak to the Israelites and say to them , ‘ When you enter the land that I am giving you as a home ,
NCV	Numbers	15	3	give the Lord offerings made by fire . These may be from your herds or flocks , as a smell pleasing to the Lord . These may be burnt offerings or sacrifices for special promises , or as gifts to him , or as festival offerings .
NCV	Numbers	15	4	The one who brings the offering shall also give the Lord a grain offering . It should be two quarts of fine flour mixed with one quart of olive oil .
NCV	Numbers	15	5	Each time you offer a lamb as a burnt offering or sacrifice , also prepare a quart of wine as a drink offering .
NCV	Numbers	15	6	“ ‘ If you are giving a male sheep , also prepare a grain offering of four quarts of fine flour mixed with one and one-fourth quarts of olive oil .
NCV	Numbers	15	7	Also prepare one and one-fourth quarts of wine as a drink offering . Its smell will be pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	15	8	“ ‘ If you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice , whether it is for a special promise or a fellowship offering to the Lord ,
NCV	Numbers	15	9	bring a grain offering with the bull . It should be six quarts of fine flour mixed with two quarts of olive oil .
NCV	Numbers	15	10	Also bring two quarts of wine as a drink offering . This offering is made by fire , and its smell will be pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	15	11	Prepare each bull or male sheep , lamb or young goat this way .
NCV	Numbers	15	12	Do this for every one of the animals you bring .
NCV	Numbers	15	13	“ ‘ All citizens must do these things in this way , and the smell of their offerings by fire will be pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	15	14	From now on if foreigners who live among you want to make offerings by fire so the smell will be pleasing to the Lord , they must offer them the same way you do .
NCV	Numbers	15	16	The teachings and rules are the same for you and for the foreigners among you. ’ ”
NCV	Numbers	15	17	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	15	18	“ Tell the Israelites : ‘ You are going to another land , where I am taking you .
NCV	Numbers	15	19	When you eat the food there , offer part of it to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	15	20	Offer a loaf of bread from the first of your grain , which will be your offering from the threshing floor .
NCV	Numbers	15	21	From now on offer to the Lord the first part of your grain .
NCV	Numbers	15	22	“ ‘ Now what if you forget to obey any of these commands the Lord gave Moses ?
NCV	Numbers	15	23	These are the Lord ’ s commands given to you through Moses , which began the day the Lord gave them to you and will continue from now on .
NCV	Numbers	15	24	If the people forget to obey one of these commands , all the people must offer a young bull as a burnt offering , a smell pleasing to the Lord . By law you must also give the grain offering and the drink offering with it , and you must bring a male goat as a sin offering .
NCV	Numbers	15	25	“ ‘ The priest will remove that sin for all the Israelites so they will belong to the Lord . They are forgiven , because they didn ’ t know they were sinning . For the wrong they did they brought offerings to the Lord , an offering by fire and a sin offering .
NCV	Numbers	15	26	So all of the people of Israel and the foreigners living among them will be forgiven . No one meant to do wrong .
NCV	Numbers	15	27	“ ‘ If just one person sins without meaning to , a year-old female goat must be brought for a sin offering .
NCV	Numbers	15	28	The priest will remove the sin of the person who sinned accidentally . He will remove it before the Lord , and the person will be forgiven .
NCV	Numbers	15	29	The same teaching is for everyone who sins accidentally—for those born Israelites and for foreigners living among you .
NCV	Numbers	15	30	“ ‘ But anyone who sins on purpose is against the Lord and must be cut off from the people , whether it is someone born among you or a foreigner .
NCV	Numbers	15	31	That person has turned against the Lord ’ s word and has not obeyed his commands . Such a person must surely be cut off from the others . He is guilty. ’ ” A Man Worked on the Sabbath
NCV	Numbers	15	32	When the Israelites were still in the desert , they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day .
NCV	Numbers	15	33	Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and all the people .
NCV	Numbers	15	34	They held the man under guard , because they did not know what to do with him .
NCV	Numbers	15	35	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ The man must surely die . All the people must kill him by throwing stones at him outside the camp. ”
NCV	Numbers	15	36	So all the people took him outside the camp and stoned him to death , as the Lord commanded Moses . The Tassels
NCV	Numbers	15	37	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	15	38	“ Speak to the Israelites and tell them this : ‘ Tie several pieces of thread together and attach them to the corners of your clothes . Put a blue thread in each one of these tassels . Wear them from now on .
NCV	Numbers	15	39	You will have these tassels to look at to remind you of all the Lord ’ s commands . Then you will obey them and not be disloyal by following what your bodies and eyes want .

NCV	Numbers	16	16	Then Moses said to Korah , “ You and all your followers must stand before the Lord tomorrow . And Aaron will stand there with you and them .
NCV	Numbers	16	2	These men gathered two hundred fifty other Israelite men , well-known leaders chosen by the community , and challenged Moses .
NCV	Numbers	16	3	They came as a group to speak to Moses and Aaron and said , “ You have gone too far . All the people are holy , every one of them , and the Lord is among them . So why do you put yourselves above all the people of the Lord ? ”
NCV	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he bowed facedown .
NCV	Numbers	16	5	Then he said to Korah and all his followers : “ Tomorrow morning the Lord will show who belongs to him . He will bring the one who is holy near to him ; he will bring to himself the person he chooses .
NCV	Numbers	16	6	So Korah , you and all your followers do this : Get some pans for burning incense .
NCV	Numbers	16	7	Tomorrow put fire and incense in them and take them before the Lord . He will choose the man who is holy . You Levites have gone too far. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	8	Moses also said to Korah , “ Listen , you Levites .
NCV	Numbers	16	9	The God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelites . He brought you near to himself to do the work in the Lord ’ s Holy Tent and to stand before all the Israelites and serve them . Isn ’ t that enough ?
NCV	Numbers	16	10	He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near to himself , yet now you want to be priests .
NCV	Numbers	16	11	You and your followers have joined together against the Lord . Your complaint is not against Aaron. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	12	Then Moses called Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , but they said , “ We will not come !
NCV	Numbers	16	13	You have brought us out of a fertile land to this desert to kill us , and now you want to order us around .
NCV	Numbers	16	14	You haven ’ t brought us into a fertile land ; you haven ’ t given us any land with fields and vineyards . Will you put out the eyes of these men ? No ! We will not come ! ”
NCV	Numbers	16	15	Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord , “ Don ’ t accept their gifts . I have not taken anything from them , not even a donkey , and I have not done wrong to any of them. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	17	Each of you must take your pan and put incense in it ; present these two hundred fifty pans before the Lord . You and Aaron must also present your pans. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	18	So each man got his pan and put burning incense in it and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	16	19	Korah gathered all his followers who were against Moses and Aaron , and they stood at the entrance to the Meeting Tent . Then the glory of the Lord appeared to everyone .
NCV	Numbers	16	20	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NCV	Numbers	16	21	“ Move away from these men so I can destroy them quickly. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	22	But Moses and Aaron bowed facedown and cried out , “ God , you are the God over the spirits of all people . Please don ’ t be angry with this whole group . Only one man has really sinned. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	23	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	16	24	“ Tell everyone to move away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	25	Moses stood and went to Dathan and Abiram ; the elders of Israel followed him .
NCV	Numbers	16	26	Moses warned the people , “ Move away from the tents of these evil men ! Don ’ t touch anything of theirs , or you will be destroyed because of their sins. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	27	So they moved away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . Dathan and Abiram were standing outside their tents with their wives , children , and little babies .
NCV	Numbers	16	28	Then Moses said , “ Now you will know that the Lord has sent me to do all these things ; it was not my idea .
NCV	Numbers	16	29	If these men die a normal death—the way men usually die—then the Lord did not really send me .
NCV	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord does something new , you will know they have insulted the Lord . The ground will open and swallow them . They will be buried alive and will go to the place of the dead , and everything that belongs to them will go with them. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	31	When Moses finished saying these things , the ground under the men split open .
NCV	Numbers	16	32	The earth opened and swallowed them and all their families . All Korah ’ s men and everything they owned went down .
NCV	Numbers	16	33	They were buried alive , going to the place of the dead , and everything they owned went with them . Then the earth covered them . They died and were gone from the community .
NCV	Numbers	16	34	The people of Israel around them heard their screams and ran away , saying , “ The earth will swallow us , too ! ”
NCV	Numbers	16	35	Then a fire came down from the Lord and destroyed the two hundred fifty men who had presented the incense .
NCV	Numbers	16	36	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	16	37	“ Tell Eleazar son of Aaron , the priest , to take all the incense pans out of the fire . Have him scatter the coals a long distance away . But the incense pans are still holy .
NCV	Numbers	16	38	Take the pans of these men who sinned and lost their lives , and hammer them into flat sheets that will be used to cover the altar . They are holy , because they were presented to the Lord , and they will be a sign to the Israelites. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	39	So Eleazar the priest gathered all the bronze pans that had been brought by the men who were burned up . He had the pans hammered into flat sheets to put on the altar ,
NCV	Numbers	16	40	as the Lord had commanded him through Moses . These sheets were to remind the Israelites that only descendants of Aaron should burn incense before the Lord . Anyone else would die like Korah and his followers . Aaron Saves the People
NCV	Numbers	16	41	The next day all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron and said , “ You have killed the Lord ’ s people. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	42	When the people gathered to complain against Moses and Aaron , they turned toward the Meeting Tent , and the cloud covered it . The glory of the Lord appeared .
NCV	Numbers	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron went in front of the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	16	44	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	16	45	“ Move away from these people so I can destroy them quickly. ” So Moses and Aaron bowed facedown .
NCV	Numbers	16	46	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Get your pan , and put fire from the altar and incense in it . Hurry to the people and remove their sin . The Lord is angry with them ; the sickness has already started. ”
NCV	Numbers	16	47	So Aaron did as Moses said . He ran to the middle of the people , where the sickness had already started among them . So Aaron offered the incense to remove their sin .
NCV	Numbers	16	48	He stood between the dead and the living , and the sickness stopped there .
NCV	Numbers	16	49	But 14,700 people died from that sickness , in addition to those who died because of Korah .
NCV	Numbers	16	50	Then Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance to the Meeting Tent . The terrible sickness had been stopped . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	17	17	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	17	2	“ Speak to the people of Israel and get twelve walking sticks from them—one from the leader of each tribe . Write the name of each man on his stick , and
NCV	Numbers	17	3	on the stick from Levi , write Aaron ’ s name . There must be one stick for the head of each tribe .
NCV	Numbers	17	4	Put them in the Meeting Tent in front of the Ark of the Agreement , where I meet with you .
NCV	Numbers	17	5	I will choose one man whose walking stick will begin to grow leaves ; in this way I will stop the Israelites from always complaining against you. ”
NCV	Numbers	17	6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites . Each of the twelve leaders gave him a walking stick—one from each tribe—and Aaron ’ s walking stick was among them .
NCV	Numbers	17	7	Moses put them before the Lord in the Tent of the Agreement .
NCV	Numbers	17	8	The next day , when Moses entered the Tent , he saw that Aaron ’ s stick ( which stood for the family of Levi ) had grown leaves . It had even budded , blossomed , and produced almonds .
NCV	Numbers	17	9	So Moses brought out to the Israelites all the walking sticks from the Lord ’ s presence . They all looked , and each man took back his stick .
NCV	Numbers	17	10	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Put Aaron ’ s walking stick back in front of the Ark of the Agreement . It will remind these people who are always turning against me to stop their complaining against me so they won ’ t die. ”
NCV	Numbers	17	11	So Moses obeyed what the Lord commanded him .
NCV	Numbers	17	12	The people of Israel said to Moses , “ We are going to die ! We are destroyed . We are all destroyed !

NCV	Numbers	18	18	But the meat will be yours , just as the breast that is presented and the right thigh will be yours .
NCV	Numbers	18	2	Bring with you your fellow Levites from your tribe , and they will help you and your sons serve in the Tent of the Agreement .
NCV	Numbers	18	3	They are under your control , to do all the work that needs to be done in the Tent . But they must not go near the things in the Holy Place or near the altar . If they do , both you and they will die .
NCV	Numbers	18	4	They will join you in taking care of the Meeting Tent . They must do the work at the Tent , and no one else may come near you .
NCV	Numbers	18	5	“ You must take care of the Holy Place and the altar so that I won ’ t become angry with the Israelites again .
NCV	Numbers	18	6	I myself chose your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift given for you to the Lord , to work at the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	18	7	But only you and your sons may serve as priests . Only you may serve at the altar or go behind the curtain . I am giving you this gift of serving as a priest , and anyone else who comes near the Holy Place will be put to death. ”
NCV	Numbers	18	8	Then the Lord said to Aaron , “ I myself make you responsible for the offerings given to me . All the holy offerings that the Israelites give to me , I give to you and your sons as your share , your continual portion .
NCV	Numbers	18	9	Your share of the holy offerings is that part which is not burned . When the people bring me gifts as most holy offerings , whether they are grain or sin or penalty offerings , they will be set apart for you and your sons .
NCV	Numbers	18	10	You must eat the offering in a most holy place . Any male may eat it , but you must respect it as holy .
NCV	Numbers	18	11	“ I also give you the offerings the Israelites present to me . I give these to you and your sons and daughters as your continual share . Anyone in your family who is clean may eat it .
NCV	Numbers	18	12	“ And I give you all the best olive oil and all the best new wine and grain . This is what the Israelites give to me , the Lord , from the first crops they harvest .
NCV	Numbers	18	13	When they bring to the Lord all the first things they harvest , they will be yours . Anyone in your family who is clean may eat these things .
NCV	Numbers	18	14	“ Everything in Israel that is given to the Lord is yours .
NCV	Numbers	18	15	The first one born to any family , whether people or animals , will be offered to the Lord . And that will be yours . But you must make a payment for every firstborn child and every firstborn animal that is unclean .
NCV	Numbers	18	16	When they are one month old , you must make a payment for them of two ounces of silver , as set by the Holy Place measure .
NCV	Numbers	18	17	“ But you must not make a payment for the firstborn ox or sheep or goat . Those animals are holy . Sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire . The smell is pleasing to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	18	19	Anything the Israelites present as holy gifts I , the Lord , give to you , your sons and daughters as your continual portion . This is a lasting agreement of salt [ a ] before the Lord for you and your children forever. ”
NCV	Numbers	18	20	The Lord also said to Aaron , “ You will not inherit any of the land , and you will not own any land among the other people . I will be yours . Out of all the Israelites , only you will inherit me .
NCV	Numbers	18	21	“ When the people of Israel give me a tenth of what they make , I will give that tenth to the Levites . This is their payment for the work they do serving at the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	18	22	But the other Israelites must never go near the Meeting Tent , or they will die for their sin .
NCV	Numbers	18	23	Only the Levites should work in the Meeting Tent and be responsible for any sins against it . This is a rule from now on . The Levites will not inherit any land among the other Israelites ,
NCV	Numbers	18	24	but when the Israelites give a tenth of everything they make to me , I will give that tenth to the Levites as a reward . That is why I said about the Levites : ‘ They will not inherit any land among the Israelites. ’ ”
NCV	Numbers	18	25	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	18	26	“ Speak to the Levites and tell them : ‘ You will receive a tenth of everything the Israelites make , which I will give to you . But you must give a tenth of that back to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	18	27	I will accept your offering just as much as I accept the offerings from others , who give new grain or new wine .
NCV	Numbers	18	28	In this way you will present an offering to the Lord as the other Israelites do . When you receive a tenth from the Israelites , you will give a tenth of that to Aaron , the priest , as the Lord ’ s share .
NCV	Numbers	18	29	Choose the best and holiest part from what you are given as the portion you must give to the Lord. ’
NCV	Numbers	18	30	“ Say to the Levites : ‘ When you present the best , it will be accepted as much as the grain and wine from the other people .
NCV	Numbers	18	31	You and your families may eat all that is left anywhere , because it is your pay for your work in the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	18	32	And if you always give the best part to the Lord , you will never be guilty . If you do not sin against the holy offerings of the Israelites , you will not die. ’ ” Footnotes - 18:19 agreement of salt The meaning is not clear , but Leviticus 2:13 says , “ Salt stands for your agreement with God that will last forever. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Numbers	19	19	The person who is clean must sprinkle this water on the unclean people on the third day and on the seventh day . On the seventh day they will become clean . They must wash their clothes and take a bath , and they will be clean that evening .
NCV	Numbers	19	2	“ These are the teachings that the Lord commanded . Tell the Israelites to get a young red cow that does not have anything wrong with it and that has never been worked .
NCV	Numbers	19	3	Give the cow to Eleazar the priest ; he will take it outside the camp and kill it .
NCV	Numbers	19	4	Then Eleazar the priest must put some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Numbers	19	5	The whole cow must be burned while he watches ; the skin , the meat , the blood , and the intestines must all be burned .
NCV	Numbers	19	6	Then the priest must take a cedar stick , a hyssop branch , and a red string and throw them onto the burning cow .
NCV	Numbers	19	7	After the priest has washed himself and his clothes with water , he may come back into the camp , but he will be unclean until evening .
NCV	Numbers	19	8	The man who burns the cow must wash himself and his clothes in water ; he will be unclean until evening .
NCV	Numbers	19	9	“ Then someone who is clean will collect the ashes from the cow and put them in a clean place outside the camp . The Israelites will keep these ashes to use in the cleansing water , in a special ceremony to cleanse away sin .
NCV	Numbers	19	10	The man who collected the cow ’ s ashes must wash his clothes and be unclean until evening . This is a lasting rule for the Israelites and for the foreigners among them .
NCV	Numbers	19	11	“ Those who touch a dead person ’ s body will be unclean for seven days .
NCV	Numbers	19	12	They must wash themselves with the cleansing water on the third day and on the seventh day ; then they will be clean . But if they do not wash themselves on the third day and the seventh day , they can not be clean .
NCV	Numbers	19	13	If those who touch a dead person ’ s body stay unclean and go to the Lord ’ s Holy Tent , it becomes unclean ; they must be cut off from Israel . If the cleansing water is not sprinkled on them , they are unclean and will stay unclean .
NCV	Numbers	19	14	“ This is the teaching about someone who dies in a tent : Anyone in the tent or anyone who enters it will be unclean for seven days .
NCV	Numbers	19	15	And every open jar or pot without a cover becomes unclean .
NCV	Numbers	19	16	If anyone is outside and touches someone who was killed by a sword or who died a natural death , or if anyone touches a human bone or a grave , that person will be unclean for seven days .
NCV	Numbers	19	17	“ So you must use the ashes from the burnt offering to make that person clean again . Pour fresh water over the ashes into a jar .
NCV	Numbers	19	18	A clean person must take a hyssop branch and dip it into the water , and then he must sprinkle it over the tent and all its objects . He must also sprinkle the people who were there , as well as anyone who touched a bone , or the body of someone who was killed , or a dead person , or a grave .
NCV	Numbers	19	20	If any who are unclean do not become clean , they must be cut off from the community . Since they were not sprinkled with the cleansing water , they stay unclean , and they could make the Lord ’ s Holy Tent unclean .
NCV	Numbers	19	21	This is a lasting rule . Those who sprinkle the cleansing water must also wash their clothes , and anyone who touches the water will be unclean until evening .

NCV	Numbers	20	20	But he answered : “ You may not pass through here. ” Then the Edomites went out to meet the Israelites with a large and powerful army .
NCV	Numbers	20	2	There was no water for the people , so they came together against Moses and Aaron .
NCV	Numbers	20	3	They argued with Moses and said , “ We should have died in front of the Lord as our brothers did .
NCV	Numbers	20	4	Why did you bring the Lord ’ s people into this desert ? Are we and our animals to die here ?
NCV	Numbers	20	5	Why did you bring us from Egypt to this terrible place ? It has no grain , figs , grapevines , or pomegranates , and there ’ s no water to drink ! ”
NCV	Numbers	20	6	So Moses and Aaron left the people and went to the entrance of the Meeting Tent . There they bowed facedown , and the glory of the Lord appeared to them .
NCV	Numbers	20	7	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	20	8	“ Take your walking stick , and you and your brother Aaron should gather the people . Speak to that rock in front of them so that its water will flow from it . When you bring the water out from that rock , give it to the people and their animals. ”
NCV	Numbers	20	9	So Moses took the stick from in front of the Lord , as he had said .
NCV	Numbers	20	10	Moses and Aaron gathered the people in front of the rock , and Moses said , “ Now listen to me , you who turn against God ! Do you want us to bring water out of this rock ? ”
NCV	Numbers	20	11	Then Moses lifted his hand and hit the rock twice with his stick . Water began pouring out , and the people and their animals drank it .
NCV	Numbers	20	12	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Because you did not believe me , and because you did not honor me as holy before the people , you will not lead them into the land I will give them. ”
NCV	Numbers	20	13	These are the waters of Meribah , [ a ] where the Israelites argued with the Lord and where he showed them he was holy . Edom Will Not Let Israel Pass
NCV	Numbers	20	14	From Kadesh , Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom . He said , “ Your brothers , the Israelites , say to you : You know about all the troubles we have had ,
NCV	Numbers	20	15	how our ancestors went down into Egypt and we lived there for many years . The people of Egypt were cruel to us and our ancestors ,
NCV	Numbers	20	16	but when we cried out to the Lord , he heard us and sent us an angel to bring us out of Egypt . “ Now we are here at Kadesh , a town on the edge of your land .
NCV	Numbers	20	17	Please let us pass through your country . We will not touch any fields of grain or vineyards , and will not drink water from the wells . We will travel only along the king ’ s road , not turning right or left until we have passed through your country. ”
NCV	Numbers	20	18	But the king of Edom answered : “ You may not pass through here . If you try , I will come and meet you with swords. ”
NCV	Numbers	20	19	The Israelites answered : “ We will go along the main road , and if we or our animals drink any of your water , we will pay for it . We only want to walk through . That ’ s all. ”
NCV	Numbers	20	21	The Edomites refused to let them pass through their country , so the Israelites turned back . Aaron Dies
NCV	Numbers	20	22	All the Israelites moved from Kadesh to Mount Hor ,
NCV	Numbers	20	23	near the border of Edom . There the Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NCV	Numbers	20	24	“ Aaron will die . He will not enter the land that I ’ m giving to the Israelites , because you both acted against my command at the waters of Meribah .
NCV	Numbers	20	25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar up on Mount Hor ,
NCV	Numbers	20	26	and take off Aaron ’ s special clothes and put them on his son Eleazar . Aaron will die there ; he will join his ancestors. ”
NCV	Numbers	20	27	Moses obeyed the Lord ’ s command . They climbed up Mount Hor , and all the people saw them go .
NCV	Numbers	20	28	Moses took off Aaron ’ s clothes and put them on Aaron ’ s son Eleazar . Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain . Moses and Eleazar came back down the mountain ,
NCV	Numbers	20	29	and when all the people learned that Aaron was dead , everyone in Israel cried for him for thirty days . Footnotes - 20:13 Meribah This name in Hebrew means “ argument. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	21	21	The Israelites sent messengers to Sihon , king of the Amorites , saying ,
NCV	Numbers	21	2	Then the Israelites made this promise to the Lord : “ If you will help us defeat these people , we will completely destroy their cities. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	3	The Lord listened to the Israelites , and he let them defeat the Canaanites . The Israelites completely destroyed the Canaanites and their cities , so the place was named Hormah . [ a ] The Bronze Snake
NCV	Numbers	21	4	The Israelites left Mount Hor and went on the road toward the Red Sea , in order to go around the country of Edom . But the people became impatient on the way
NCV	Numbers	21	5	and grumbled at God and Moses . They said , “ Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in this desert ? There is no bread and no water , and we hate this terrible food ! ”
NCV	Numbers	21	6	So the Lord sent them poisonous snakes ; they bit the people , and many of the Israelites died .
NCV	Numbers	21	7	The people came to Moses and said , “ We sinned when we grumbled at you and the Lord . Pray that the Lord will take away these snakes. ” So Moses prayed for the people .
NCV	Numbers	21	8	The Lord said to Moses , “ Make a bronze snake , and put it on a pole . When anyone who is bitten looks at it , that person will live. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	9	So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole . Then when a snake bit anyone , that person looked at the bronze snake and lived . The Journey to Moab
NCV	Numbers	21	10	The Israelites went and camped at Oboth .
NCV	Numbers	21	11	They went from Oboth to Iye Abarim , in the desert east of Moab .
NCV	Numbers	21	12	From there they went and camped in the Zered Valley .
NCV	Numbers	21	13	From there they went and camped across the Arnon , in the desert just inside the Amorite country . The Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites .
NCV	Numbers	21	14	That is why the Book of the Wars of the Lord says : “ . . . . and Waheb in Suphah , and the ravines , the Arnon ,
NCV	Numbers	21	15	and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the settlement of Ar . These places are at the border of Moab. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	16	The Israelites went from there to Beer ; a well is there where the Lord said to Moses , “ Gather the people and I will give them water. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	17	Then the Israelites sang this song : “ Pour out water , well ! Sing about it .
NCV	Numbers	21	18	Princes dug this well . Important men made it . With their scepters and poles , they dug it. ” The people went from the desert to Mattanah .
NCV	Numbers	21	19	From Mattanah they went to Nahaliel and on to Bamoth .
NCV	Numbers	21	20	From Bamoth they went to the valley of Moab where the top of Mount Pisgah looks over the desert . Israel Kills Sihon and Og
NCV	Numbers	21	22	“ Let us pass through your country . We will not go through any fields of grain or vineyards , or drink water from the wells . We will travel only along the king ’ s road until we have passed through your country. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	23	But King Sihon would not let the Israelites pass through his country . He gathered his whole army together , and they marched out to meet Israel in the desert . At Jahaz they fought the Israelites .
NCV	Numbers	21	24	Israel killed the king and captured his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River . They took the land as far as the Ammonite border , which was strongly defended .
NCV	Numbers	21	25	Israel captured all the Amorite cities and lived in them , taking Heshbon and all the towns around it .
NCV	Numbers	21	26	Heshbon was the city where Sihon , the Amorite king , lived . In the past he had fought with the king of Moab and had taken all the land as far as the Arnon .
NCV	Numbers	21	27	That is why the poets say : “ Come to Heshbon and rebuild it ; rebuild Sihon ’ s city .
NCV	Numbers	21	28	A fire began in Heshbon ; flames came from Sihon ’ s city . It destroyed Ar in Moab , and it burned the Arnon highlands .
NCV	Numbers	21	29	How terrible for you , Moab ! The people of Chemosh are ruined . His sons ran away and his daughters were captured by Sihon , king of the Amorites .
NCV	Numbers	21	30	But we defeated those Amorites . We ruined their towns from Heshbon to Dibon , and we destroyed them as far as Nophah , near Medeba. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	31	So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites .
NCV	Numbers	21	32	After Moses sent spies to the town of Jazer , they captured the towns around it , forcing out the Amorites who lived there .
NCV	Numbers	21	33	Then the Israelites went up the road toward Bashan . Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet the Israelites , and they fought at Edrei .
NCV	Numbers	21	34	The Lord said to Moses , “ Don ’ t be afraid of him . I will hand him , his whole army , and his land over to you . Do to him what you did to Sihon , the Amorite king who lived in Heshbon. ”
NCV	Numbers	21	35	So the Israelites killed Og and his sons and all his army ; no one was left alive . And they took his land . Footnotes - 21:3 Hormah This name in Hebrew means “ completely destroyed. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	22	22	But God became angry because Balaam went , so the angel of the Lord stood in the road to stop Balaam . Balaam was riding his donkey , and he had two servants with him .
NCV	Numbers	22	2	Balak son of Zippor saw everything the Israelites had done to the Amorites .
NCV	Numbers	22	3	And Moab was scared of so many Israelites ; truly , Moab was terrified by them .
NCV	Numbers	22	4	The Moabites said to the elders of Midian , “ These people will take everything around us like an ox eating grass. ” Balak son of Zippor was the king of Moab at this time .
NCV	Numbers	22	5	He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor , near the Euphrates River in his native land . Balak said , “ A nation has come out of Egypt that covers the land . They have camped next to me ,
NCV	Numbers	22	6	and they are too powerful for me . So come and put a curse on them . Maybe then I can defeat them and make them leave the area . I know that if you bless someone , the blessings happen , and if you put a curse on someone , it happens. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	7	The elders of Moab and Midian went with payment in their hands . When they found Balaam , they told him what Balak had said .
NCV	Numbers	22	8	Balaam said to them , “ Stay here for the night , and I will tell you what the Lord tells me. ” So the Moabite leaders stayed with him .
NCV	Numbers	22	9	God came to Balaam and asked , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
NCV	Numbers	22	10	Balaam said to God , “ The king of Moab , Balak son of Zippor , sent them to me with this message :
NCV	Numbers	22	11	‘ A nation has come out of Egypt that covers the land . So come and put a curse on them , and maybe I can fight them and force them out of my land. ’ ”
NCV	Numbers	22	12	But God said to Balaam , “ Do not go with them . Don ’ t put a curse on those people , because I have blessed them. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	13	The next morning Balaam awoke and said to Balak ’ s leaders , “ Go back to your own country ; the Lord has refused to let me go with you. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	14	So the Moabite leaders went back to Balak and said , “ Balaam refused to come with us. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	15	So Balak sent other leaders—this time there were more of them , and they were more important .
NCV	Numbers	22	16	They went to Balaam and said , “ Balak son of Zippor says this : Please don ’ t let anything stop you from coming to me .
NCV	Numbers	22	17	I will pay you very well , and I will do what you say . Come and put a curse on these people for me. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	18	But Balaam answered Balak ’ s servants , “ King Balak could give me his palace full of silver and gold , but I can not disobey the Lord my God in anything , great or small .
NCV	Numbers	22	19	You stay here tonight as the other men did , and I will find out what more the Lord tells me. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	20	That night God came to Balaam and said , “ These men have come to ask you to go with them . Go , but only do what I tell you. ” Balaam ’ s Donkey Speaks
NCV	Numbers	22	21	Balaam got up the next morning and put a saddle on his donkey . Then he went with the Moabite leaders .
NCV	Numbers	22	23	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a sword in his hand , the donkey left the road and went into the field . Balaam hit the donkey to force her back on the road .
NCV	Numbers	22	24	Later , the angel of the Lord stood on a narrow path between two vineyards , with walls on both sides .
NCV	Numbers	22	25	Again the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , and she walked close to one wall , crushing Balaam ’ s foot against it . So he hit her again .
NCV	Numbers	22	26	The angel of the Lord went ahead again and stood at a narrow place , too narrow to turn left or right .
NCV	Numbers	22	27	When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord , she lay down under Balaam . This made him so angry that he hit her with his stick .
NCV	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord made the donkey talk , and she said to Balaam , “ What have I done to make you hit me three times ? ”
NCV	Numbers	22	29	Balaam answered the donkey , “ You have made me look foolish ! I wish I had a sword in my hand ! I would kill you right now ! ”
NCV	Numbers	22	30	But the donkey said to Balaam , “ I am your very own donkey , which you have ridden for years . Have I ever done this to you before ? ” “ No , ” Balaam said .
NCV	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord let Balaam see the angel of the Lord , who was standing in the road with his sword drawn . Then Balaam bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	Numbers	22	32	The angel of the Lord asked Balaam , “ Why have you hit your donkey three times ? I have stood here to stop you , because what you are doing is wrong .
NCV	Numbers	22	33	The donkey saw me and turned away from me three times . If she had not turned away , I would have killed you by now , but I would have let her live. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	34	Then Balaam said to the angel of the Lord , “ I have sinned ; I did not know you were standing in the road to stop me . If I am wrong , I will go back. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	35	The angel of the Lord said to Balaam , “ Go with these men , but say only what I tell you. ” So Balaam went with Balak ’ s leaders .
NCV	Numbers	22	36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming , he went out to meet him at Ar in Moab , which was beside the Arnon , at the edge of his country .
NCV	Numbers	22	37	Balak said to Balaam , “ I had asked you before to come quickly . Why didn ’ t you come to me ? I am able to reward you well. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	38	But Balaam answered , “ I have come to you now , but I can ’ t say just anything . I can only say what God tells me to say. ”
NCV	Numbers	22	39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth .
NCV	Numbers	22	40	Balak offered cattle and sheep as a sacrifice and gave some meat to Balaam and the leaders with him .
NCV	Numbers	22	41	The next morning Balak took Balaam to Bamoth Baal ; from there he could see the edge of the Israelite camp . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	23	23	No tricks will work on the people of Jacob , and no magic will work against Israel . People now say about them , ‘ Look what God has done for Israel ! ’
NCV	Numbers	23	2	Balak did what Balaam asked , and they offered a bull and a male sheep on each of the altars .
NCV	Numbers	23	3	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Stay here beside your burnt offering and I will go . If the Lord comes to me , I will tell you whatever he shows me. ” Then Balaam went to a higher place .
NCV	Numbers	23	4	God came to Balaam there , and Balaam said to him , “ I have prepared seven altars , and I have offered a bull and a male sheep on each altar. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	5	The Lord told Balaam what he should say . Then the Lord said , “ Go back to Balak and give him this message. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	6	So Balaam went back to Balak . Balak and all the leaders of Moab were still standing beside his burnt offering
NCV	Numbers	23	7	when Balaam gave them this message : “ Balak brought me here from Aram ; the king of Moab brought me from the eastern mountains . Balak said , ‘ Come , put a curse on the people of Jacob for me . Come , call down evil on the people of Israel. ’
NCV	Numbers	23	8	But God has not cursed them , so I can not curse them . The Lord has not called down evil on them , so I can not call down evil on them .
NCV	Numbers	23	9	I see them from the top of the mountains ; I see them from the hills . I see a people who live alone , who think they are different from other nations .
NCV	Numbers	23	10	No one can number the many people of Jacob , and no one can count a fourth of Israel . Let me die like good men , and let me end up like them ! ”
NCV	Numbers	23	11	Balak said to Balaam , “ What have you done to me ? I brought you here to curse my enemies , but you have only blessed them ! ”
NCV	Numbers	23	12	But Balaam answered , “ I must say what the Lord tells me to say. ” Balaam ’ s Second Message
NCV	Numbers	23	13	Then Balak said to him , “ Come with me to another place , where you can also see the people . But you can only see part of them , not all of them . Curse them for me from there. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	14	So Balak took Balaam to the field of Zophim , on top of Mount Pisgah . There Balak built seven altars and offered a bull and a male sheep on each altar .
NCV	Numbers	23	15	So Balaam said to Balak , “ Stay here by your burnt offering , and I will meet with God over there. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	16	So the Lord came to Balaam and told him what to say . Then he said , “ Go back to Balak and say such and such. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	17	So Balaam went to Balak , where he and the leaders of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering . Balak asked him , “ What did the Lord say ? ”
NCV	Numbers	23	18	Then Balaam gave this message : “ Stand up , Balak , and listen . Hear me , son of Zippor .
NCV	Numbers	23	19	God is not a human being , and he will not lie . He is not a human , and he does not change his mind . What he says he will do , he does . What he promises , he makes come true .
NCV	Numbers	23	20	He told me to bless them , so I can not change the blessing .
NCV	Numbers	23	21	He has found no wrong in the people of Jacob ; he saw no fault in Israel . The Lord their God is with them , and they praise their King .
NCV	Numbers	23	22	God brought them out of Egypt ; they are as strong as a wild ox .
NCV	Numbers	23	24	The people rise up like a lioness ; they get up like a lion . Lions don ’ t rest until they have eaten , until they have drunk their enemies ’ blood. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ You haven ’ t cursed these people , so at least don ’ t bless them ! ”
NCV	Numbers	23	26	Balaam answered Balak , “ I told you before that I can only do what the Lord tells me. ” Balaam ’ s Third Message
NCV	Numbers	23	27	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Come , I will take you to another place . Maybe God will be pleased to let you curse them from there. ”
NCV	Numbers	23	28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor , the mountain that looks over the desert .
NCV	Numbers	23	29	Balaam told Balak , “ Build me seven altars here and prepare for me seven bulls and seven male sheep. ”

NCV	Numbers	24	24	Ships will sail from the shores of Cyprus and defeat Assyria and Eber , but they will also be destroyed. ”
NCV	Numbers	24	2	When Balaam saw the Israelites camped in their tribes , the Spirit of God took control of him ,
NCV	Numbers	24	3	and he gave this message : “ This is the message of Balaam son of Beor , the message of a man who sees clearly ;
NCV	Numbers	24	4	this is the message of a man who hears the words of God . I see a vision from the Almighty , and my eyes are open as I fall before him .
NCV	Numbers	24	5	Your tents are beautiful , people of Jacob ! So are your homes , Israel !
NCV	Numbers	24	6	Your tents spread out like valleys , like gardens beside a river . They are like spices planted by the Lord , like cedar trees growing by the water .
NCV	Numbers	24	7	Israel ’ s water buckets will always be full , and their crops will have plenty of water . Their king will be greater than Agag ; their kingdom will be very great .
NCV	Numbers	24	8	God brought them out of Egypt ; they are as strong as a wild ox . They will defeat their enemies and break their enemies ’ bones ; they will shoot them with arrows .
NCV	Numbers	24	9	Like a lion , they lie waiting to attack ; like a lioness , no one would be brave enough to wake them . Anyone who blesses you will be blessed , and anyone who curses you will be cursed. ”
NCV	Numbers	24	10	Then Balak was angry with Balaam , and he pounded his fist . He said to Balaam , “ I called you here to curse my enemies , but you have continued to bless them three times .
NCV	Numbers	24	11	Now go home ! I said I would pay you well , but the Lord has made you lose your reward. ”
NCV	Numbers	24	12	Balaam said to Balak , “ When you sent messengers to me , I told them ,
NCV	Numbers	24	13	‘ Balak could give me his palace filled with silver and gold , but I still can not go against the Lord ’ s commands . I could not do anything , good or bad , on my own , but I must say what the Lord says. ’
NCV	Numbers	24	14	Now I am going back to my own people , but I will tell you what these people will do to your people in the future. ” Balaam ’ s Final Message
NCV	Numbers	24	15	Then Balaam gave this message : “ This is the message of Balaam son of Beor , the message of a man who sees clearly ;
NCV	Numbers	24	16	this is the message of a man who hears the words of God . I know well the Most High God . I see a vision from the Almighty , and my eyes are open as I fall before him .
NCV	Numbers	24	17	I see someone who will come someday , someone who will come , but not soon . A star will come from Jacob ; a ruler will rise from Israel . He will crush the heads of the Moabites and smash the skulls of the sons of Sheth .
NCV	Numbers	24	18	Edom will be conquered ; his enemy Edom will be conquered , but Israel will grow wealthy .
NCV	Numbers	24	19	A ruler will come from the descendants of Jacob and will destroy those left in the city. ”
NCV	Numbers	24	20	Then Balaam saw Amalek and gave this message : “ Amalek was the most important nation , but Amalek will be destroyed at last. ”
NCV	Numbers	24	21	Then Balaam saw the Kenites and gave this message : “ Your home is safe , like a nest on a cliff .
NCV	Numbers	24	22	But you Kenites will be burned up ; Assyria will keep you captive. ”
NCV	Numbers	24	23	Then Balaam gave this message : “ No one can live when God does this .

NCV	Numbers	25	25	While the people of Israel were still camped at Acacia , the men began sinning sexually with Moabite women .
NCV	Numbers	25	2	The women invited them to their sacrifices to their gods , and the Israelites ate food there and worshiped these gods .
NCV	Numbers	25	3	So the Israelites began to worship Baal of Peor , and the Lord was very angry with them .
NCV	Numbers	25	4	The Lord said to Moses , “ Get all the leaders of the people and kill them in open daylight in the presence of the Lord . Then the Lord will not be angry with the people of Israel. ”
NCV	Numbers	25	5	So Moses said to Israel ’ s judges , “ Each of you must put to death your people who have become worshipers of Baal of Peor. ”
NCV	Numbers	25	6	Moses and the Israelites were gathered at the entrance to the Meeting Tent , crying there . Then an Israelite man brought a Midianite woman to his brothers in plain sight of Moses and all the people .
NCV	Numbers	25	7	Phinehas son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , the priest , saw this , so he left the meeting and got his spear .
NCV	Numbers	25	8	He followed the Israelite into his tent and drove his spear through both the Israelite man and the Midianite woman . Then the terrible sickness among the Israelites stopped .
NCV	Numbers	25	9	This sickness had killed twenty-four thousand people .
NCV	Numbers	25	10	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	25	11	“ Phinehas son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , the priest , has saved the Israelites from my anger . He hates sin as much as I do . Since he tried to save my honor among them , I will not kill them .
NCV	Numbers	25	12	So tell Phinehas that I am making my peace agreement with him .
NCV	Numbers	25	13	He and his descendants will always be priests , because he had great concern for the honor of his God . He removed the sins of the Israelites so they would belong to God. ”
NCV	Numbers	25	14	The Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son of Salu . He was the leader of a family in the tribe of Simeon .
NCV	Numbers	25	15	And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi daughter of Zur , who was the chief of a Midianite family .
NCV	Numbers	25	16	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	25	17	“ The Midianites are your enemies , and you should kill them .
NCV	Numbers	25	18	They have already made you their enemies , because they tricked you at Peor and because of their sister Cozbi , the daughter of a Midianite leader .

NCV	Numbers	27	27	Then the daughters of Zelophehad came near . Zelophehad was the son of Hepher , the son of Gilead , the son of Makir , the son of Manasseh . Zelophehad ’ s daughters belonged to the family groups of Manasseh son of Joseph . The daughters ’ names were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .

NCV	Numbers	27	3	“ Our father died in the desert . He was not one of Korah ’ s followers who came together against the Lord , but he died because of his own sin , and he had no sons .
NCV	Numbers	27	4	Our father ’ s name will die out because he had no sons . Give us property among our father ’ s relatives. ”
NCV	Numbers	27	5	So Moses brought their case to the Lord ,
NCV	Numbers	27	6	and the Lord said to him ,
NCV	Numbers	27	7	“ The daughters of Zelophehad are right ; they should certainly get what their father owned . Give them property among their father ’ s relatives .
NCV	Numbers	27	8	“ Tell the Israelites , ‘ If a man dies and has no son , then everything he owned should go to his daughter .
NCV	Numbers	27	9	If he has no daughter , then everything he owned should go to his brothers .
NCV	Numbers	27	10	If he has no brothers , then everything he owned should go to his father ’ s brothers .
NCV	Numbers	27	11	And if his father had no brothers , then everything he owned should go to the nearest relative in his family group . This should be a rule among the people of Israel , as the Lord has given this command to Moses. ’ ” Joshua Is the New Leader
NCV	Numbers	27	12	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Climb this mountain in the Abarim Mountains , and look at the land I have given to the Israelites .
NCV	Numbers	27	13	After you have seen it , you will die and join your ancestors as your brother Aaron did ,
NCV	Numbers	27	14	because you both acted against my command in the Desert of Zin . You did not honor me as holy before the people at the waters of Meribah. ” ( This was at Meribah in Kadesh in the Desert of Zin . )
NCV	Numbers	27	15	Moses said to the Lord ,
NCV	Numbers	27	16	“ The Lord is the God of the spirits of all people . May he choose a leader for these people ,

NCV	Numbers	30	2	“ If a man makes a promise to the Lord or says he will do something special , he must keep his promise . He must do what he said .
NCV	Numbers	30	3	If a young woman still living at home makes a promise to the Lord or pledges to do something special ,
NCV	Numbers	30	4	and if her father hears about the promise or pledge and says nothing , she must do what she promised . She must keep her pledge .
NCV	Numbers	30	5	But if her father hears about the promise or pledge and does not allow it , then the promise or pledge does not have to be kept . Her father would not allow it , so the Lord will free her from her promise .
NCV	Numbers	30	6	“ If a woman makes a pledge or a careless promise and then gets married ,
NCV	Numbers	30	7	and if her husband hears about it and says nothing , she must keep her promise or the pledge she made .

NCV	Numbers	30	9	“ If a widow or divorced woman makes a promise , she must do whatever she promised .
NCV	Numbers	30	10	“ If a woman makes a promise or pledge while she is married ,
NCV	Numbers	30	11	and if her husband hears about it but says nothing and does not stop her , she must keep her promise or pledge .
NCV	Numbers	30	12	But if her husband hears about it and cancels it , she does not have to do what she said . Her husband has canceled it , so the Lord will free her from it .
NCV	Numbers	30	13	A woman ’ s husband may make her keep or cancel any promise or pledge she has made .
NCV	Numbers	30	14	If he says nothing to her about it for several days , she must keep her promises . If he hears about them and says nothing , she must keep her promises .

NCV	Numbers	31	31	So Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord commanded Moses .
NCV	Numbers	31	2	“ Pay back the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites ; after that you will die. ”
NCV	Numbers	31	3	So Moses said to the people , “ Get some men ready for war . The Lord will use them to pay back the Midianites .
NCV	Numbers	31	4	Send to war a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel. ”
NCV	Numbers	31	5	So twelve thousand men got ready for war , a thousand men from each tribe .
NCV	Numbers	31	6	Moses sent those men to war ; Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest was with them . He took with him the holy things and the trumpets for giving the alarm .
NCV	Numbers	31	7	They fought the Midianites as the Lord had commanded Moses , and they killed every Midianite man .
NCV	Numbers	31	8	Among those they killed were Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur , and Reba , who were the five kings of Midian . They also killed Balaam son of Beor with a sword .
NCV	Numbers	31	9	The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children , and they took all their flocks , herds , and goods .
NCV	Numbers	31	10	They burned all the Midianite towns where they had settled and all their camps ,
NCV	Numbers	31	11	but they took all the people and animals and goods .
NCV	Numbers	31	12	Then they brought the captives , the animals , and the goods back to Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the Israelites . Their camp was on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River , across from Jericho .
NCV	Numbers	31	13	Moses , Eleazar the priest , and all the leaders of the people went outside the camp to meet them .
NCV	Numbers	31	14	Moses was angry with the army officers , the commanders over a thousand men , and those over a hundred men , who returned from war .
NCV	Numbers	31	15	He asked them , “ Why did you let the women live ?
NCV	Numbers	31	16	They were the ones who followed Balaam ’ s advice and turned the Israelites from the Lord at Peor . Then a terrible sickness struck the Lord ’ s people .
NCV	Numbers	31	17	Kill all the Midianite boys , and kill all the Midianite women who have had sexual relations .
NCV	Numbers	31	18	But save for yourselves the girls who have not had sexual relations with a man .
NCV	Numbers	31	19	“ All you men who killed anyone or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp for seven days . On the third and seventh days you and your captives must make yourselves clean .
NCV	Numbers	31	20	You must clean all your clothes and anything made of leather , goat hair , or wood. ”
NCV	Numbers	31	21	Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone to war , “ These are the teachings that the Lord gave to Moses :
NCV	Numbers	31	22	Put any gold , silver , bronze , iron , tin , or lead—
NCV	Numbers	31	23	anything that will not burn—into the fire , and then it will be clean . But also purify those things with the cleansing water . Then they will be clean . If something can not stand the fire , wash it with the water .
NCV	Numbers	31	24	On the seventh day wash your clothes , and you will be clean . After that you may come into the camp. ” Dividing the Goods
NCV	Numbers	31	25	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	31	26	“ You , Eleazar the priest , and the leaders of the family groups should take a count of the goods , the men , and the animals that were taken .
NCV	Numbers	31	27	Then divide those possessions between the soldiers who went to war and the rest of the people .
NCV	Numbers	31	28	From the soldiers who went to war , take a tax for the Lord of one item out of every five hundred . This includes people , cattle , donkeys , or sheep .
NCV	Numbers	31	29	Take it from the soldiers ’ half , and give it to Eleazar the priest as the Lord ’ s share .
NCV	Numbers	31	30	And from the people ’ s half , take one item out of every fifty . This includes people , cattle , donkeys , sheep , or other animals . Give that to the Levites , who take care of the Lord ’ s Holy Tent. ”
NCV	Numbers	31	32	of them to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	31	33	72,000 cattle ,
NCV	Numbers	31	34	61,000 donkeys ,
NCV	Numbers	31	35	and 32,000 women who had not had sexual relations with a man .
NCV	Numbers	31	36	The soldiers who went to war got 337,000 sheep ,
NCV	Numbers	31	37	and they gave
NCV	Numbers	31	675	of them to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	31	38	They got 36,000 cattle , and they gave
NCV	Numbers	31	72	of them to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	31	39	They got 30,500 donkeys , and they gave
NCV	Numbers	31	61	of them to the Lord .
NCV	Numbers	31	40	They got 16,000 people , and they gave
NCV	Numbers	31	41	Moses gave the Lord ’ s share to Eleazar the priest , as the Lord had commanded him .
NCV	Numbers	31	42	Moses separated the people ’ s half from the soldiers ’ half .
NCV	Numbers	31	43	The people got 337,500 sheep ,
NCV	Numbers	31	44	36,000 cattle ,
NCV	Numbers	31	45	30,500 donkeys ,
NCV	Numbers	31	46	and 16,000 people .
NCV	Numbers	31	47	From the people ’ s half Moses took one item out of every fifty for the Lord . This included the animals and the people . Then he gave them to the Levites , who took care of the Lord ’ s Holy Tent . This was what the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Numbers	31	48	Then the officers of the army , the commanders of a thousand men and commanders of a hundred men , came to Moses .
NCV	Numbers	31	49	They told Moses , “ We , your servants , have counted our soldiers under our command , and not one of them is missing .
NCV	Numbers	31	50	So we have brought the Lord a gift of the gold things that each of us found : arm bands , bracelets , signet rings , earrings , and necklaces . These are to remove our sins so we will belong to the Lord. ”
NCV	Numbers	31	51	So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them , which had been made into all kinds of objects .
NCV	Numbers	31	52	The commanders of a thousand men and the commanders of a hundred men gave the Lord the gold , and all of it together weighed about
NCV	Numbers	31	420	pounds ;
NCV	Numbers	31	53	each soldier had taken something for himself .
NCV	Numbers	31	54	Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the commanders of a thousand men and the commanders of a hundred men . Then they put it in the Meeting Tent as a memorial before the Lord for the people of Israel . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Numbers	32	32	We will cross over into Canaan and go before the Lord ready for battle . But our land will be east of the Jordan River. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	2	they came to Moses , Eleazar the priest , and the leaders of the people . 3-4 They said , “ We , your servants , have flocks and herds . The Lord has captured for the Israelites a land that is good for animals—the land around Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah , Heshbon , Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo , and Beon .
NCV	Numbers	32	5	If it pleases you , we would like this land to be given to us . Don ’ t make us cross the Jordan River. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	6	Moses told the people of Gad and Reuben , “ Shall your brothers go to war while you stay behind ?
NCV	Numbers	32	7	You will discourage the Israelites from going over to the land the Lord has given them .
NCV	Numbers	32	8	Your ancestors did the same thing . I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look at the land .
NCV	Numbers	32	9	They went as far as the Valley of Eshcol , and when they saw the land , they discouraged the Israelites from going into the land the Lord had given them .
NCV	Numbers	32	10	The Lord became very angry that day and made this promise :
NCV	Numbers	32	11	‘ None of the people who came from Egypt and who are twenty years old or older will see the land that I promised to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . These people have not followed me completely .
NCV	Numbers	32	12	Only Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun followed the Lord completely. ’
NCV	Numbers	32	13	“ The Lord was angry with Israel , so he made them wander in the desert for forty years . Finally all the people who had sinned against the Lord died ,
NCV	Numbers	32	14	and now you are acting just like your ancestors ! You sinful people are making the Lord even more angry with Israel .
NCV	Numbers	32	15	If you quit following him , it will add to their stay in the desert , and you will destroy all these people. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	16	Then the Reubenites and Gadites came up to Moses and said , “ We will build pens for our animals and cities for our children here .
NCV	Numbers	32	17	Then our children will be in strong , walled cities , safe from the people who live in this land . Then we will prepare for war . We will help the other Israelites get their land ,
NCV	Numbers	32	18	and we will not return home until every Israelite has received his land .
NCV	Numbers	32	19	We won ’ t take any of the land west of the Jordan River ; our part of the land is east of the Jordan. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	20	So Moses told them , “ You must do these things . You must go before the Lord into battle
NCV	Numbers	32	21	and cross the Jordan River armed , until the Lord forces out the enemy .
NCV	Numbers	32	22	After the Lord helps us take the land , you may return home . You will have done your duty to the Lord and Israel , and you may have this land as your own .
NCV	Numbers	32	23	“ But if you don ’ t do these things , you will be sinning against the Lord ; know for sure that you will be punished for your sin .
NCV	Numbers	32	24	Build cities for your children and pens for your animals , but then you must do what you promised. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	25	The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses , “ We are your servants , and we will do what you , our master , command .
NCV	Numbers	32	26	Our children , wives , and all our cattle will stay in the cities of Gilead ,
NCV	Numbers	32	27	but we , your servants , will prepare for battle . We will go over and fight for the Lord , as you , our master , have said. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	28	So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest , to Joshua son of Nun , and to the leaders of the tribes of Israel .
NCV	Numbers	32	29	Moses said to them , “ If the Gadites and Reubenites prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you , to go before the Lord and help you take the land , give them the land of Gilead for their own .
NCV	Numbers	32	30	But if they do not go over armed , they will not receive it ; their land will be in Canaan with you. ”
NCV	Numbers	32	31	The Gadites and Reubenites answered , “ We are your servants , and we will do as the Lord said .
NCV	Numbers	32	33	So Moses gave that land to the tribes of Gad , Reuben , and East Manasseh . ( Manasseh was Joseph ’ s son . ) That land had been the kingdom of Sihon , king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og , king of Bashan , as well as all the cities and the land around them .
NCV	Numbers	32	34	The Gadites rebuilt the cities of Dibon , Ataroth , Aroer ,
NCV	Numbers	32	35	Atroth Shophan , Jazer , Jogbehah ,

NCV	Numbers	34	34	The Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	34	2	“ Give this command to the people of Israel : ‘ You will soon enter Canaan and it will be yours . These shall be the borders :
NCV	Numbers	34	3	On the south you will get part of the Desert of Zin near the border of Edom . On the east side your southern border will start at the south end of the Dead Sea ,
NCV	Numbers	34	4	cross south of Scorpion Pass , and go through the Desert of Zin and south of Kadesh Barnea . Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon .
NCV	Numbers	34	5	From Azmon it will go to the brook of Egypt , and it will end at the Mediterranean Sea .
NCV	Numbers	34	6	“ ‘ Your western border will be the Mediterranean Sea .
NCV	Numbers	34	7	“ ‘ Your northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea and go to Mount Hor .
NCV	Numbers	34	8	From Mount Hor it will go to Lebo Hamath , and on to Zedad .
NCV	Numbers	34	9	Then the border will go to Ziphron , and it will end at Hazar Enan . This will be your northern border .
NCV	Numbers	34	10	“ ‘ Your eastern border will begin at Hazar Enan and go to Shepham .
NCV	Numbers	34	11	From Shepham the border will go east of Ain to Riblah and along the hills east of Lake Galilee .
NCV	Numbers	34	12	Then the border will go down along the Jordan River and end at the Dead Sea . “ ‘ These are the borders around your country. ’ ”
NCV	Numbers	34	13	So Moses gave this command to the Israelites : “ This is the land you will receive . Throw lots to divide it among the nine and one-half tribes , because the Lord commanded that it should be theirs .
NCV	Numbers	34	14	The tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh have already received their land .
NCV	Numbers	34	15	These two and one-half tribes received land east of the Jordan River , across from Jericho. ”
NCV	Numbers	34	16	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	34	17	“ These are the men who will divide the land : Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun .
NCV	Numbers	34	18	Also take one leader from each tribe to help divide the land .

NCV	Numbers	35	35	The Lord spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab across from Jericho by the Jordan River . He said ,
NCV	Numbers	35	2	“ Command the Israelites to give the Levites cities to live in from the land they receive . Also give the Levites the pastureland around these cities .
NCV	Numbers	35	3	Then the Levites will have cities where they may live and pastureland for their cattle , flocks , and other animals .
NCV	Numbers	35	4	The pastureland you give the Levites will extend fifteen hundred feet from the city wall .
NCV	Numbers	35	5	Also measure three thousand feet in each direction outside the city wall—three thousand feet east of the city , three thousand feet south of the city , three thousand feet west of the city , and three thousand feet north of the city , with the city in the center . This will be pastureland for the Levites ’ cities . Cities of Safety
NCV	Numbers	35	6	“ Six of the cities you give the Levites will be cities of safety . A person who accidentally kills someone may run to one of those cities for safety . You must also give forty-two other cities to the Levites ;
NCV	Numbers	35	7	give the Levites a total of forty-eight cities and their pastures .
NCV	Numbers	35	8	The larger tribes of Israel must give more cities , and the smaller tribes must give fewer cities . Each tribe must give some of its cities to the Levites , but the number of cities they give will depend on the size of their land. ”
NCV	Numbers	35	9	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NCV	Numbers	35	10	“ Tell the Israelites these things : ‘ When you cross the Jordan River and go into Canaan ,
NCV	Numbers	35	11	you must choose cities to be cities of safety , so that a person who accidentally kills someone may run to them for safety .
NCV	Numbers	35	12	There the person will be safe from the dead person ’ s relative who has the duty of punishing the killer . He will not die before he receives a fair trial in court .
NCV	Numbers	35	13	The six cities you give will be cities of safety .
NCV	Numbers	35	14	Give three cities east of the Jordan River and three cities in Canaan as cities of safety .
NCV	Numbers	35	15	These six cities will be places of safety for citizens of Israel , as well as for foreigners and other people living with you . Any of these people who accidentally kills someone may run to one of these cities .
NCV	Numbers	35	16	“ ‘ Anyone who uses an iron weapon to kill someone is a murderer . He must be put to death .
NCV	Numbers	35	17	Anyone who takes a rock and kills a person with it is a murderer . He must be put to death .
NCV	Numbers	35	18	Anyone who picks up a piece of wood and kills someone with it is a murderer . He must be put to death .
NCV	Numbers	35	19	A relative of the dead person must put the murderer to death ; when they meet , the relative must kill the murderer .
NCV	Numbers	35	20	A person might shove someone or throw something at someone and cause death .
NCV	Numbers	35	21	Or a person might hit someone with his hand and cause death . If it were done from hate , the person is a murderer and must be put to death . A relative of the dead person must kill the murderer when they meet .
NCV	Numbers	35	22	“ ‘ But a person might suddenly shove someone , and not from hatred . Or a person might accidentally throw something and hit someone .
NCV	Numbers	35	23	Or a person might drop a rock on someone he couldn ’ t see and kill that person . There was no plan to hurt anyone and no hatred for the one who was killed .
NCV	Numbers	35	24	If that happens , the community must judge between the relative of the dead person and the killer , according to these rules .
NCV	Numbers	35	25	They must protect the killer from the dead person ’ s relative , sending the killer back to the original city of safety , to stay there until the high priest dies ( the high priest had the holy oil poured on him ) .
NCV	Numbers	35	26	“ ‘ Such a person must never go outside the limits of the city of safety .
NCV	Numbers	35	27	If a relative of the dead person finds the killer outside the city , the relative may kill that person and not be guilty of murder .
NCV	Numbers	35	28	The killer must stay in the city of safety until the high priest dies . After the high priest dies , the killer may go home .
NCV	Numbers	35	29	“ ‘ These laws are for you from now on , wherever you live .
NCV	Numbers	35	30	“ ‘ If anyone kills a person , the murderer may be put to death only if there are witnesses . No one may be put to death with only one witness .

NCV	Numbers	36	36	The leaders of Gilead ’ s family group went to talk to Moses and the leaders of the families of Israel . ( Gilead was the son of Makir , the son of Manasseh , the son of Joseph . )
NCV	Numbers	36	2	They said , “ The Lord commanded you , our master , to give the land to the Israelites by throwing lots , and the Lord commanded you to give the land of Zelophehad , our brother , to his daughters .
NCV	Numbers	36	3	But if his daughters marry men from other tribes of Israel , then that land will leave our family , and the people of the other tribes will get that land . So we will lose some of our land .
NCV	Numbers	36	4	When the time of Jubilee comes for the Israelites , their land will go to the tribes of the people they marry ; their land will be taken away from us , the land we received from our fathers. ”
NCV	Numbers	36	5	Then Moses gave the Israelites this command from the Lord : “ These men from the tribe of Joseph are right .
NCV	Numbers	36	6	This is the Lord ’ s command to Zelophehad ’ s daughters : You may marry anyone you wish , as long as the person is from your own tribe .
NCV	Numbers	36	7	In this way the Israelites ’ land will not pass from tribe to tribe , and each Israelite will keep the land in the tribe that belonged to his ancestors .
NCV	Numbers	36	8	A woman who inherits her father ’ s land may marry , but she must marry someone from her own tribe . In this way every Israelite will keep the land that belonged to his ancestors .

NCV	Numbers	36	10	Zelophehad ’ s daughters obeyed the Lord ’ s command to Moses .

NCV	Deuteronomy	1	1	This is the message Moses gave to all the people of Israel in the desert east of the Jordan River . They were in the desert area near Suph , between Paran and the towns of Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	2	( The trip from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea on the Mount Seir road takes eleven days . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	3	Forty years after the Israelites had left Egypt , on the first day of the eleventh month , Moses told the people of Israel everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	4	This was after the Lord had defeated Sihon and Og . Sihon was king of the Amorite people and lived in Heshbon . Og was king of Bashan and lived in Ashteroth and Edrei .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	5	Now the Israelites were east of the Jordan River in the land of Moab , and there Moses began to explain what God had commanded . He said :
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	6	The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Sinai and said , “ You have stayed long enough at this mountain .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	7	Get ready , and go to the mountain country of the Amorites , and to all the places around there—the Jordan Valley , the mountains , the western hills , the southern area , the seacoast , the land of Canaan , and Lebanon . Go as far as the great river , the Euphrates .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	8	See , I have given you this land , so go in and take it for yourselves . The Lord promised it to your ancestors—Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob and their descendants. ” Moses Appoints Leaders
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	9	At that time I said , “ I am not able to take care of you by myself .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	10	The Lord your God has made you grow in number so that there are as many of you as there are stars in the sky .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	11	I pray that the Lord , the God of your ancestors , will give you a thousand times more people and do all the wonderful things he promised .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	12	But I can not take care of your problems , your troubles , and your arguments by myself .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	13	So choose some men from each tribe—wise men who have understanding and experience—and I will make them leaders over you. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	14	And you said , “ That ’ s a good thing to do. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the wise and experienced leaders of your tribes , and I made them your leaders . I appointed commanders over a thousand people , over a hundred people , over fifty people , and over ten people and made them officers over your tribes .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	16	Then I told your leaders , “ Listen to the arguments between your people . Judge fairly between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	17	When you judge , be fair to everyone ; don ’ t act as if one person is more important than another , and don ’ t be afraid of anyone , because your decision comes from God . Bring the hard cases to me , and I will judge them. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	18	At that time I told you everything you must do . Spies Enter the Land
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	19	Then , as the Lord our God commanded us , we left Mount Sinai and went toward the mountain country of the Amorite people . We went through that large and terrible desert you saw , and then we came to Kadesh Barnea .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	20	I said to you , “ You have now come to the mountain country of the Amorites , to the land the Lord our God will give us .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	21	Look , here it is ! Go up and take it . The Lord , the God of your ancestors , told you to do this , so don ’ t be afraid and don ’ t worry. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	22	Then all of you came to me and said , “ Let ’ s send men before us to spy out the land . They can come back and tell us about the way we should go and the cities we will find. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	23	I thought that was a good idea , so I chose twelve of your men , one for each tribe .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	24	They left and went up to the mountains , and when they came to the Valley of Eshcol they explored it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	25	They took some of the fruit from that land and brought it down to us , saying , “ It is a good land that the Lord our God is giving us. ” Israel Refuses to Enter
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	26	But you refused to go . You would not obey the command of the Lord your God ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	27	but grumbled in your tents , saying , “ The Lord hates us . He brought us out of Egypt just to give us to the Amorites , who will destroy us .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	28	Where can we go now ? The spies we sent have made us afraid , because they said , ‘ The people there are stronger and taller than we are . The cities are big , with walls up to the sky . And we saw the Anakites there ! ’ ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	29	Then I said to you , “ Don ’ t be frightened ; don ’ t be afraid of those people .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord your God will go ahead of you and fight for you as he did in Egypt ; you saw him do it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	31	And in the desert you saw how the Lord your God carried you , like one carries a child . And he has brought you safely all the way to this place. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	32	But you still did not trust the Lord your God , even though
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	33	he had always gone before you to find places for you to camp . In a fire at night and in a cloud during the day , he showed you which way to go .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	34	When the Lord heard what you said , he was angry and made an oath , saying ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	35	“ I promised a good land to your ancestors , but none of you evil people will see it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	36	Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will see it . I will give him and his descendants the land he walked on , because he followed the Lord completely. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	37	Because of you , the Lord was also angry with me and said , “ You won ’ t enter the land either ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	38	but your assistant , Joshua son of Nun , will enter it . Encourage him , because he will lead Israel to take the land for their own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	39	“ Your little children that you said would be captured , who do not know right from wrong at this time , will go into the land . I will give the land to them , and they will take it for their own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	40	But you must turn around and follow the desert road toward the Red Sea. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	41	Then you said to me , “ We have sinned against the Lord , but now we will go up and fight , as the Lord our God commanded us. ” Then all of you put on weapons , thinking it would be easy to go into the mountains .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	42	But the Lord said to me , “ Tell the people , ‘ You must not go up there and fight . I will not be with you , and your enemies will defeat you. ’ ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I told you , but you would not listen . You would not obey the Lord ’ s command . You were proud , so you went on up into the mountains ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	44	and the Amorites who lived in those mountains came out and fought you . They chased you like bees and defeated you from Edom to Hormah .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	45	So you came back and cried before the Lord , but the Lord did not listen to you ; he refused to pay attention to you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	46	So you stayed in Kadesh a long time . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Deuteronomy	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	2	Then the Lord said to me ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	3	“ You have traveled through these mountains long enough . Turn north
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	4	and give the people this command : ‘ You will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives , the descendants of Esau who live in Edom . They will be afraid of you , but be very careful .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	5	Do not go to war against them . I will not give you any of their land—not even a foot of it , because I have given the mountains of Edom to Esau as his own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	6	You must pay them in silver for any food you eat or water you drink. ’ ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	7	The Lord your God has blessed everything you have done ; he has protected you while you traveled through this great desert . The Lord your God has been with you for the past forty years , and you have had everything you needed .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	8	So we passed by our relatives , the descendants of Esau who lived in Edom . We turned off the Jordan Valley road that comes from the towns of Elath and Ezion Geber and traveled along the desert road to Moab . The Land of Ar
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	9	Then the Lord said to me , “ Don ’ t bother the people of Moab . Don ’ t go to war against them , because I will not give you any of their land as your own ; I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their own. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	10	( The Emites , who lived in Ar before , were strong people , and there were many of them . They were very tall , like the Anakites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	11	The Emites were thought to be Rephaites , like the Anakites , but the Moabite people called them Emites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horites also lived in Edom before , but the descendants of Esau forced them out and destroyed them , taking their place as Israel did in the land the Lord gave them as their own . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	13	And the Lord said to me , “ Now get up and cross the Zered Valley. ” So we crossed the valley .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	14	It had been thirty-eight years from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley . By then , all the fighting men from that time had died , as the Lord had promised would happen .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	15	The Lord continued to work against them to remove them from the camp until they were all dead .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	16	When the last of those fighting men had died ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	17	the Lord said to me ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	18	“ Today you will pass by Ar , on the border of Moab .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	19	When you come near the people of Ammon , don ’ t bother them or go to war against them , because I will not give you any of their land as your own . I have given it to the descendants of Lot for their own. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	20	( That land was also thought to be a land of the Rephaites , because those people used to live there , but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	21	They were strong people , and there were many of them ; they were very tall , like the Anakites . The Lord destroyed the Zamzummites , and the Ammonites forced them out of the land and took their place .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	22	The Lord did the same thing for the descendants of Esau , who lived in Edom , when he destroyed the Horites . The Edomites forced them out of the land and took their place , and they live there to this day .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	23	The Cretan people came from Crete and destroyed the Avvites , who lived in towns all the way to Gaza ; the Cretans destroyed them and took their place . ) Fighting the Amorites
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	24	The Lord said , “ Get up and cross the Arnon Ravine . See , I am giving you the power to defeat Sihon the Amorite , king of Heshbon , and I am giving you his land . So fight against him and begin taking his land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	25	Today I will begin to make all the people in the world afraid of you . When they hear reports about you , they will shake with fear , and they will be terrified of you. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	26	I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon . They offered him peace , saying ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	27	“ If you let us pass through your country , we will stay on the road and not turn right or left .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	28	We will pay you in silver for any food we eat or water we drink . We only want to walk through your country .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	29	The descendants of Esau in Edom let us go through their land , and so did the Moabites in Ar . We want to cross the Jordan River into the land the Lord our God has given us. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass , because the Lord your God had made him stubborn . The Lord wanted you to defeat Sihon , and now this has happened .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	31	The Lord said to me , “ See , I have begun to give Sihon and his country to you . Begin taking the land as your own. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	32	Then Sihon and all his army came out and fought us at Jahaz ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	33	but the Lord our God gave Sihon to us . We defeated him , his sons , and all his army .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	34	We captured all his cities at that time and completely destroyed them , as well as the men , women , and children . We left no one alive .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	35	But we kept the cattle and valuable things from the cities for ourselves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	2	36	We defeated Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Ravine , and we defeated the town in the ravine , and even as far as Gilead . No town was too strong for us ; the Lord our God gave us all of them .

NCV	Deuteronomy	3	3	So the Lord our God gave us Og king of Bashan and all his army ; we defeated them and left no one alive .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	2	The Lord said to me , “ Don ’ t be afraid of Og , because I will hand him , his whole army , and his land over to you . Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites , who ruled in Heshbon. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	4	Then we captured all of Og ’ s cities , all sixty of them , and took the whole area of Argob , Og ’ s kingdom in Bashan .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	5	All these were strong cities , with high walls and gates with bars . And there were also many small towns with no walls .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	6	We completely destroyed them , just like the cities of Sihon king of Heshbon . We killed all the men , women , and children ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	7	but we kept all the cattle and valuable things from the cities for ourselves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	8	So at that time we took the land east of the Jordan River , from the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon , from these two Amorite kings .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	9	( Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonian people , but the Amorites call it Senir . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	10	We captured all the cities on the high plain and all of Gilead , and we took all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei , towns in Og ’ s kingdom of Bashan .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	11	( Only Og king of Bashan was left of the few Rephaites . His bed was made of iron , and it was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide ! It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah . ) The Land Is Divided
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	12	At that time we took this land to be our own . I gave the people of Reuben and Gad the land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine , as well as half of the mountain country of Gilead and the cities in it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	13	To the people of East Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan , the kingdom of Og . ( The area of Argob in Bashan was called the land of the Rephaites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair , a descendant of Manasseh , took the whole area of Argob , all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites . So that land was named for Jair , and even today Bashan is called the Towns of Jair . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	15	I gave Gilead to Makir .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	16	I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the land that begins at Gilead and goes from the Arnon Ravine ( the middle of the Arnon is the border ) to the Jabbok River , which is the Ammonite border .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	17	The border on the west was the Jordan River in the Jordan Valley , and it goes from Lake Galilee to the Dead Sea west of Mount Pisgah .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	18	At that time I gave you this command : “ The Lord your God has given you this land as your own . Now your fighting men must take their weapons , and you must lead the other Israelites across the river .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	19	Your wives , your young children , and your cattle may stay here . I know you have many cattle , and they may stay here in the cities I have given you ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	20	until the Lord also gives your Israelite relatives a place to rest . They will receive the land the Lord your God has given them on the other side of the Jordan River . After that , you may each return to the land I have given you. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	21	Then I gave this command to Joshua : “ You have seen for yourself all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings . The Lord will do the same thing to all the kingdoms where you are going .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	22	Don ’ t be afraid of them , because the Lord your God will fight for you. ” Moses Can not Enter the Land
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	23	Then I begged the Lord :
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	24	“ Lord God , you have begun to show me , your servant , how great you are . You have great strength , and no other god in heaven or on earth can do the powerful things you do . There is no other god like you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	25	Please let me cross the Jordan River so that I may see the good land by the Jordan . I want to see the beautiful mountains and Lebanon. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	26	But the Lord was angry with me because of you , and he would not listen to me . The Lord said to me , “ That ’ s enough . Don ’ t talk to me anymore about it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	27	Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah and look west , north , south , and east . You can look at the land , but you will not cross the Jordan River .
NCV	Deuteronomy	3	28	Appoint Joshua and help him be brave and strong . He will lead the people across the river and give them the land that they are to inherit , but you can only look at it. ”

NCV	Deuteronomy	4	4	But all of you who continued following the Lord your God are still alive today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	2	Don ’ t add to these commands , and don ’ t leave anything out , but obey the commands of the Lord your God that I give you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	3	You have seen for yourselves what the Lord did at Baal Peor , how the Lord your God destroyed everyone among you who followed Baal in Peor .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	5	Look , I have taught you the laws and rules the Lord my God commanded me . Now you can obey the laws in the land you are entering , in the land you will take .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	6	Obey these laws carefully , in order to show the other nations that you have wisdom and understanding . When they hear about these laws , they will say , “ This great nation of Israel is wise and understanding. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	7	No other nation is as great as we are . Their gods do not come near them , but the Lord our God comes near when we pray to him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	8	And no other nation has such good teachings and commands as those I am giving to you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	9	But be careful ! Watch out and don ’ t forget the things you have seen . Don ’ t forget them as long as you live , but teach them to your children and grandchildren .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	10	Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Mount Sinai . He said to me , “ Bring the people together so I can tell them what I have to say . Then they will respect me as long as they live in the land , and they will teach these things to their children. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	11	When you came and stood at the bottom of the mountain , it blazed with fire that reached to the sky , and black clouds made it very dark .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	12	The Lord spoke to you from the fire . You heard the sound of words , but you did not see him ; there was only a voice .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	13	The Lord told you about his Agreement , the Ten Commandments . He told you to obey them , and he wrote them on two stone tablets .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	14	Then the Lord commanded me to teach you the laws and rules that you must obey in the land you will take when you cross the Jordan River . Laws About Idols
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	15	Since the Lord spoke to you from the fire at Mount Sinai , but you did not see him , watch yourselves carefully !
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	16	Don ’ t sin by making idols of any kind , and don ’ t make statues—of men or women ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	17	of animals on earth or birds that fly in the air ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	18	of anything that crawls on the ground , or of fish in the water below .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	19	When you look up at the sky , you see the sun , moon , and stars , and everything in the sky . But don ’ t bow down and worship them , because the Lord your God has made these things for all people everywhere .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	20	But the Lord brought you out of Egypt , which tested you like a furnace for melting iron , and he made you his very own people , as you are now .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	21	The Lord was angry with me because of you , and he swore that I would not cross the Jordan River to go into the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	22	I will die here in this land and not cross the Jordan , but you will soon go across and take that good land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	23	Be careful . Don ’ t forget the Agreement of the Lord your God that he made with you , and don ’ t make any idols for yourselves , as the Lord your God has commanded you not to do .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	24	The Lord your God is a jealous God , like a fire that burns things up .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	25	Even after you have lived in the land a long time and have had children and grandchildren , don ’ t do evil things . Don ’ t make any kind of idol , and don ’ t do what the Lord your God says is evil , because that will make him angry .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	26	If you do , I ask heaven and earth to speak against you this day that you will quickly be removed from this land that you are crossing the Jordan River to take . You will not live there long after that , but you will be completely destroyed .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	27	The Lord will scatter you among the other nations . Only a few of you will be left alive , and those few will be in other nations where the Lord will send you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will worship gods made by people , gods made of wood and stone , that can not see , hear , eat , or smell .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	29	But even there you can look for the Lord your God , and you will find him if you look for him with your whole being .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	30	It will be hard when all these things happen to you . But after that you will come back to the Lord your God and obey him ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	31	because the Lord your God is a merciful God . He will not leave you or destroy you . He will not forget the Agreement with your ancestors , which he swore to them . The Lord Is Great
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	32	Nothing like this has ever happened before ! Look at the past , long before you were even born . Go all the way back to when God made humans on the earth , and look from one end of heaven to the other . Nothing like this has ever been heard of !
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	33	No other people have ever heard God speak from a fire and have still lived . But you have .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	34	No other god has ever taken for himself one nation out of another . But the Lord your God did this for you in Egypt , right before your own eyes . He did it with tests , signs , miracles , war , and great sights , by his great power and strength .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	35	He showed you things so you would know that the Lord is God , and there is no other God besides him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	36	He spoke to you from heaven to teach you . He showed you his great fire on earth , and you heard him speak from the fire .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	37	Because the Lord loved your ancestors , he chose you , their descendants , and he brought you out of Egypt himself by his great strength .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	38	He forced nations out of their land ahead of you , nations that were bigger and stronger than you were . The Lord did this so he could bring you into their land and give it to you as your own , and this land is yours today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	39	Know and believe today that the Lord is God . He is God in heaven above and on the earth below . There is no other god !
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	40	Obey his laws and commands that I am giving you today so that things will go well for you and your children . Then you will live a long time in the land that the Lord your God is giving to you forever . Cities of Safety
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	41	Moses chose three cities east of the Jordan River ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	42	where a person who accidentally killed someone could go . If the person was not killed because of hatred , the murderer ’ s life could be saved by running to one of these cities .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	43	These were the cities : Bezer in the desert high plain was for the Reubenites ; Ramoth in Gilead was for the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan was for the Manassites . The Laws Moses Gave
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	44	These are the teachings Moses gave to the people of Israel .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	45	They are the rules , commands , and laws he gave them when they came out of Egypt .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	46	They were in the valley near Beth Peor , east of the Jordan River , in the land of Sihon . Sihon king of the Amorites ruled in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	47	The Israelites took his land and the land of Og king of Bashan , the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	48	This land went from Aroer , on the edge of the Arnon Ravine , to Mount Hermon .
NCV	Deuteronomy	4	49	It included all the Jordan Valley east of the Jordan River , and it went as far as the Dead Sea below Mount Pisgah . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Deuteronomy	5	5	( At that time I stood between you and the Lord in order to tell you what the Lord said ; you were afraid of the fire , so you would not go up on the mountain . ) The Lord said :
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made an Agreement with us at Mount Sinai .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	3	He did not make this Agreement with our ancestors , but he made it with us , with all of us who are alive here today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord spoke to you face to face from the fire on the mountain .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	6	“ I am the Lord your God ; I brought you out of the land of Egypt where you were slaves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	7	“ You must not have any other gods except me .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	8	“ You must not make for yourselves any idols or anything to worship that looks like something in the sky above or on the earth below or in the water below the land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	9	You must not worship or serve any idol , because I , the Lord your God , am a jealous God . If people sin against me and hate me , I will punish their children , even their grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	10	But I will be very kind for a thousand lifetimes to those who love me and obey my commands .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	11	“ You must not use the name of the Lord your God thoughtlessly , because the Lord will punish anyone who uses his name in this way .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	12	“ Keep the Sabbath as a holy day , as the Lord your God has commanded you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	13	You may work and get everything done during six days each week ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is a day of rest to honor the Lord your God . On that day no one may do any work : not you , your son or daughter , your male or female slaves , your ox , your donkey , or any of your animals , or the foreigners living in your cities . That way your servants may rest as you do .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there by his great power and strength . So the Lord your God has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	16	“ Honor your father and your mother as the Lord your God has commanded you . Then you will live a long time , and things will go well for you in the land that the Lord your God is going to give you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	17	“ You must not murder anyone .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	18	“ You must not be guilty of adultery .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	19	“ You must not steal .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	20	“ You must not tell lies about your neighbor .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	21	“ You must not want to take your neighbor ’ s wife . You must not want to take your neighbor ’ s house or land , his male or female slaves , his ox or his donkey , or anything that belongs to your neighbor. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	22	The Lord spoke these commands to all of you on the mountain in a loud voice out of the fire , the cloud , and the deep darkness ; he did not say anything else . Then he wrote them on two stone tablets , and he gave them to me .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	23	When you heard the voice from the darkness , as the mountain was blazing with fire , all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	24	And you said , “ The Lord our God has shown us his glory and majesty , and we have heard his voice from the fire . Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks to him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	25	But now , we will die ! This great fire will burn us up , and we will die if we hear the Lord our God speak anymore .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	26	No human being has ever heard the living God speaking from a fire and still lived , but we have .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	27	Moses , you go near and listen to everything the Lord our God says . Then you tell us what the Lord our God tells you , and we will listen and obey. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	28	The Lord heard what you said to me , and he said to me , “ I have heard what the people said to you . Everything they said was good .
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	29	I wish their hearts would always respect me and that they would always obey my commands so that things would go well for them and their children forever !
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	30	“ Go and tell the people to return to their tents ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	31	but you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands , rules , and laws that you must teach the people to obey in the land I am giving them as their own. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	5	32	So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you , and follow the commands exactly .

NCV	Deuteronomy	6	6	Always remember these commands I give you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	2	You , your children , and your grandchildren must respect the Lord your God as long as you live . Obey all his rules and commands I give you so that you will live a long time .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	3	Listen , Israel , and carefully obey these laws . Then all will go well for you , and you will become a great nation in a fertile land , just as the Lord , the God of your ancestors , has promised you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	4	Listen , people of Israel ! The Lord our God is the only Lord .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	5	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , and all your strength .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	7	Teach them to your children , and talk about them when you sit at home and walk along the road , when you lie down and when you get up .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	8	Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign . Tie them on your forehead to remind you ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	9	and write them on your doors and gates .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	10	The Lord your God will bring you into the land he promised to your ancestors , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and he will give it to you . The land has large , growing cities you did not build ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	11	houses full of good things you did not buy , wells you did not dig , and vineyards and olive trees you did not plant . You will eat as much as you want .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	12	But be careful ! Do not forget the Lord , who brought you out of the land of Egypt where you were slaves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	13	Respect the Lord your God . You must worship him and make your promises only in his name .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	14	Do not worship other gods as the people around you do ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	15	because the Lord your God is a jealous God . He is present with you , and if you worship other gods , he will become angry with you and destroy you from the earth .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	16	Do not test the Lord your God as you did at Massah .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	17	Be sure to obey the commands of the Lord your God and the rules and laws he has given you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	18	Do what the Lord says is good and right so that things will go well for you . Then you may go in and take the good land the Lord promised to your ancestors .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	19	He will force all your enemies out as you go in , as the Lord has said .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	20	In the future when your children ask you , “ What is the meaning of the laws , commands , and rules the Lord our God gave us ? ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	21	tell them , “ We were slaves to the king of Egypt , but the Lord brought us out of Egypt by his great power .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	22	The Lord showed us great and terrible signs and miracles , which he did to Egypt , the king , and his whole family .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	23	The Lord brought us out of Egypt to lead us here and to give us the land he promised our ancestors .
NCV	Deuteronomy	6	24	The Lord ordered us to obey all these commands and to respect the Lord our God so that we will always do well and stay alive , as we are today .

NCV	Deuteronomy	7	7	The Lord did not care for you and choose you because there were many of you—you are the smallest nation of all .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	2	The Lord your God will hand these nations over to you , and when you defeat them , you must destroy them completely . Do not make a peace treaty with them or show them any mercy .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	3	Do not marry any of them , or let your daughters marry their sons , or let your sons marry their daughters .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	4	If you do , those people will turn your children away from me , to begin serving other gods . Then the Lord will be very angry with you , and he will quickly destroy you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	5	This is what you must do to those people : Tear down their altars , smash their holy stone pillars , cut down their Asherah idols , and burn their idols in the fire .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	6	You are holy people who belong to the Lord your God . He has chosen you from all the people on earth to be his very own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	8	But the Lord chose you because he loved you , and he kept his promise to your ancestors . So he brought you out of Egypt by his great power and freed you from the land of slavery , from the power of the king of Egypt .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	9	So know that the Lord your God is God , the faithful God . He will keep his agreement of love for a thousand lifetimes for people who love him and obey his commands .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	10	But he will pay back those people who hate him . He will destroy them , and he will not be slow to pay back those who hate him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	11	So be careful to obey the commands , rules , and laws I give you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	12	If you pay attention to these laws and obey them carefully , the Lord your God will keep his agreement and show his love to you , as he promised your ancestors .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	13	He will love and bless you . He will make the number of your people grow ; he will bless you with children . He will bless your fields with good crops and will give you grain , new wine , and oil . He will bless your herds with calves and your flocks with lambs in the land he promised your ancestors he would give you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	14	You will be blessed more than any other people . Every husband and wife will have children , and all your cattle will have calves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	15	The Lord will take away all disease from you ; you will not have the terrible diseases that were in Egypt , but he will give them to all the people who hate you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	16	You must destroy all the people the Lord your God hands over to you . Do not feel sorry for them , and do not worship their gods , or they will trap you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	17	You might say to yourselves , “ Because these nations are stronger than we are , we can ’ t force them out. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	18	But don ’ t be afraid of them . Remember what the Lord your God did to all of Egypt and its king .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	19	You saw for yourselves the troubles , signs , and miracles he did , how the Lord ’ s great power and strength brought you out of Egypt . The Lord your God will do the same thing to all the nations you now fear .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	20	The Lord your God will also send terror among them so that even those who are alive and hiding from you will die .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	21	Don ’ t be afraid of them , because the Lord your God is with you ; he is a great God and people are afraid of him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	22	When the Lord your God forces those nations out of the land , he will do it little by little ahead of you . You won ’ t be able to destroy them all at once ; otherwise , the wild animals will grow too many in number .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	23	But the Lord your God will hand those nations over to you , confusing them until they are destroyed .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	24	The Lord will help you defeat their kings , and the world will forget who they were . No one will be able to stop you ; you will destroy them all .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	25	Burn up their idols in the fire . Do not wish for the silver and gold they have , and don ’ t take it for yourselves , or you will be trapped by it . The Lord your God hates it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	7	26	Do not bring one of those hateful things into your house , or you will be completely destroyed along with it . Hate and reject those things ; they must be completely destroyed . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Deuteronomy	8	2	Remember how the Lord your God has led you in the desert for these forty years , taking away your pride and testing you , because he wanted to know what was in your heart . He wanted to know if you would obey his commands .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	3	He took away your pride when he let you get hungry , and then he fed you with manna , which neither you nor your ancestors had ever seen . This was to teach you that a person does not live on bread alone , but by everything the Lord says .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	4	During these forty years , your clothes did not wear out , and your feet did not swell .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	5	Know in your heart that the Lord your God corrects you as a parent corrects a child .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	6	Obey the commands of the Lord your God , living as he has commanded you and respecting him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	7	The Lord your God is bringing you into a good land , a land with rivers and pools of water , with springs that flow in the valleys and hills ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	9	It is a land where you will have plenty of food , where you will have everything you need , where the rocks are iron , and where you can dig copper out of the hills .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	10	When you have all you want to eat , then praise the Lord your God for giving you a good land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	11	Be careful not to forget the Lord your God so that you fail to obey his commands , laws , and rules that I am giving to you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	12	When you eat all you want and build nice houses and live in them ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	13	when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase , when you have more of everything ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	14	then your heart will become proud . You will forget the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , where you were slaves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	15	He led you through the large and terrible desert that was dry and had no water , and that had poisonous snakes and stinging insects . He gave you water from a solid rock
NCV	Deuteronomy	8	16	and manna to eat in the desert . Manna was something your ancestors had never seen . He did this to take away your pride and to test you , so things would go well for you in the end .

NCV	Deuteronomy	9	2	The people there are Anakites , who are strong and tall . You know about them , and you have heard it said : “ No one can stop the Anakites. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	3	But today remember that the Lord your God goes in before you to destroy them like a fire that burns things up . He will defeat them ahead of you , and you will force them out and destroy them quickly , just as the Lord has said .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	4	After the Lord your God has forced those nations out ahead of you , don ’ t say to yourself , “ The Lord brought me here to take this land because I am so good. ” No ! It is because these nations are evil that the Lord will force them out ahead of you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	5	You are going in to take the land , not because you are good and honest , but because these nations are evil . That is why the Lord your God will force them out ahead of you , to keep his promise to your ancestors , to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	6	The Lord your God is giving you this good land to take as your own . But know this : It is not because you are good ; you are a stubborn people . Remember the Lord ’ s Anger
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember this and do not forget it : You made the Lord your God angry in the desert . You would not obey the Lord from the day you left Egypt until you arrived here .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	8	At Mount Sinai you made the Lord angry—angry enough to destroy you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	10	The Lord gave me two stone tablets , which God had written on with his own finger . On them were all the commands that the Lord gave to you on the mountain out of the fire , on the day you were gathered there .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	11	When the forty days and forty nights were over , the Lord gave me the two stone tablets , the tablets with the Agreement on them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	12	Then the Lord told me , “ Get up and go down quickly from here , because the people you brought out from Egypt are ruining themselves . They have quickly turned away from what I commanded and have made an idol for themselves. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	13	The Lord said to me , “ I have watched these people , and they are very stubborn !
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	14	Get away so that I may destroy them and make the whole world forget who they are . Then I will make another nation from you that will be bigger and stronger than they are. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	15	So I turned and came down the mountain that was burning with fire , and the two stone tablets with the Agreement were in my hands .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	16	When I looked , I saw you had sinned against the Lord your God and had made an idol in the shape of a calf . You had quickly turned away from what the Lord had told you to do .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	17	So I took the two stone tablets and threw them down , breaking them into pieces right in front of you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then I again bowed facedown on the ground before the Lord for forty days and forty nights ; I did not eat bread or drink water . You had sinned by doing what the Lord said was evil , and you made him angry .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	19	I was afraid of the Lord ’ s anger and rage , because he was angry enough with you to destroy you , but the Lord listened to me again .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	20	And the Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him , but then I prayed for Aaron , too .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	21	I took that sinful calf idol you had made and burned it in the fire . I crushed it into a powder like dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	22	You also made the Lord angry at Taberah , Massah , and Kibroth Hattaavah .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	23	Then the Lord sent you away from Kadesh Barnea and said , “ Go up and take the land I have given you. ” But you rejected the command of the Lord your God . You did not trust him or obey him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	24	You have refused to obey the Lord as long as I have known you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	25	The Lord had said he would destroy you , so I threw myself down in front of him for those forty days and forty nights .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	26	I prayed to the Lord and said , “ Lord God , do not destroy your people , your own people , whom you freed and brought out of Egypt by your great power and strength .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember your servants Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . Don ’ t look at how stubborn these people are , and don ’ t look at their sin and evil .
NCV	Deuteronomy	9	28	Otherwise , Egypt will say , ‘ It was because the Lord was not able to take his people into the land he promised them , and it was because he hated them that he took them into the desert to kill them. ’

NCV	Deuteronomy	10	10	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights just like the first time , and the Lord listened to me this time also . He did not want to destroy you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	2	I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets , which you broke , and you will put the new tablets in the Ark. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made the Ark out of acacia wood , and I cut out two stone tablets like the first ones . Then I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	4	The Lord wrote the same things on these tablets he had written before —the Ten Commandments that he had told you on the mountain from the fire , on the day you were gathered there . And the Lord gave them to me .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	5	Then I turned and came down the mountain ; I put the tablets in the Ark I had made , as the Lord had commanded , and they are still there .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	6	( The people of Israel went from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah . Aaron died there and was buried ; his son Eleazar became priest in his place .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	7	From Moserah they went to Gudgodah , and from Gudgodah they went to Jotbathah , a place with streams of water .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time the Lord chose the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord . They were to serve the Lord and to bless the people in his name , which they still do today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	9	That is why the Levites did not receive any land of their own ; instead , they received the Lord himself as their gift , as the Lord your God told them . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	11	The Lord said to me , “ Go and lead the people so that they will go in and take the land I promised their ancestors. ” What the Lord Wants You to Do
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	12	Now , Israel , this is what the Lord your God wants you to do : Respect the Lord your God , and do what he has told you to do . Love him . Serve the Lord your God with your whole being ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	13	and obey the Lord ’ s commands and laws that I am giving you today for your own good .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	14	The Lord owns the world and everything in it—the heavens , even the highest heavens , are his .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	15	But the Lord cared for and loved your ancestors , and he chose you , their descendants , over all the other nations , just as it is today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	16	Give yourselves completely to serving him , and do not be stubborn any longer .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	17	The Lord your God is God of all gods and Lord of all lords . He is the great God , who is strong and wonderful . He does not take sides , and he will not be talked into doing evil .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	18	He helps orphans and widows , and he loves foreigners and gives them food and clothes .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	19	You also must love foreigners , because you were foreigners in Egypt .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	20	Respect the Lord your God and serve him . Be loyal to him and make your promises in his name .
NCV	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is the one you should praise ; he is your God , who has done great and wonderful things for you , which you have seen with your own eyes .

NCV	Deuteronomy	11	11	But the land that you will soon cross the Jordan River to take is a land of hills and valleys , a land that drinks rain from heaven .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	2	Remember today it was not your children who saw and felt the correction of the Lord your God . They did not see his majesty , his power , his strength ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	3	or his signs and the things he did in Egypt to the king and his whole country .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	4	They did not see what he did to the Egyptian army , its horses and chariots , when he drowned them in the Red Sea as they were chasing you . The Lord ruined them forever .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	5	They did not see what he did for you in the desert until you arrived here .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	6	They did not see what he did to Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab the Reubenite , when the ground opened up and swallowed them , their families , their tents , and everyone who stood with them in Israel .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	7	It was you who saw all these great things the Lord has done .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	8	So obey all the commands I am giving you today so that you will be strong and can go in and take the land you are going to take as your own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	9	Then you will live a long time in the land that the Lord promised to give to your ancestors and their descendants , a fertile land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	10	The land you are going to take is not like Egypt , where you were . There you had to plant your seed and water it , like a vegetable garden , by using your feet .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	12	It is a land the Lord your God cares for . His eyes are on it continually , and he watches it from the beginning of the year to the end .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	13	If you carefully obey the commands I am giving you today and love the Lord your God and serve him with your whole being ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	14	then he will send rain on your land at the right time , in the fall and spring , and you will be able to gather your grain , new wine , and oil .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	15	He will put grass in the fields for your cattle , and you will have plenty to eat .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	16	Be careful , or you will be fooled and will turn away to serve and worship other gods .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	17	If you do , the Lord will become angry with you and will shut the heavens so it will not rain . Then the land will not grow crops , and you will soon die in the good land the Lord is giving you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	18	Remember my words with your whole being . Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign ; tie them on your foreheads to remind you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	19	Teach them well to your children , talking about them when you sit at home and walk along the road , when you lie down and when you get up .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	20	Write them on your doors and gates
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	21	so that both you and your children will live a long time in the land the Lord promised your ancestors , as long as the skies are above the earth .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	22	If you are careful to obey every command I am giving you to follow , and love the Lord your God , and do what he has told you to do , and are loyal to him ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	23	then the Lord will force all those nations out of the land ahead of you , and you will take the land from nations that are bigger and stronger than you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	24	Everywhere you step will be yours . Your land will go from the desert to Lebanon and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	25	No one will be able to stop you . The Lord your God will do what he promised and will make the people afraid everywhere you go .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	26	See , today I am letting you choose a blessing or a curse .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	27	You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I am giving you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	28	But you will be cursed if you disobey the commands of the Lord your God . So do not disobey the commands I am giving you today , and do not worship other gods you do not know .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	29	When the Lord your God brings you into the land you will take as your own , you are to announce the blessings from Mount Gerizim and the curses from Mount Ebal .
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	30	( These mountains are on the other side of the Jordan River , to the west , toward the sunset . They are near the great trees of Moreh in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Jordan Valley opposite Gilgal . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	11	31	You will soon cross the Jordan River to enter and take the land the Lord your God is giving you . When you take it over and live there ,

NCV	Deuteronomy	12	12	There rejoice before the Lord your God . Everyone should rejoice : you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites from your towns who have no land of their own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	2	When you inherit the lands of these nations , you must completely destroy all the places where they serve their gods , on high mountains and hills and under every green tree .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	3	Tear down their altars , smash their holy stone pillars , and burn their Asherah idols in the fire . Cut down their idols and destroy their names from those places .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	4	Don ’ t worship the Lord your God that way ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	5	but look for the place the Lord your God will choose—a place among your tribes where he is to be worshiped . Go there ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	6	and bring to that place your burnt offerings and sacrifices ; bring a tenth of what you gain and your special gifts ; bring what you have promised and the special gifts you want to give the Lord , and bring the first animals born to your herds and flocks .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	7	There you will be together with the Lord your God . There you and your families will eat , and you will enjoy all the good things for which you have worked , because the Lord your God has blessed you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	8	Do not worship the way we have been doing today , each person doing what he thinks is right .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	9	You have not yet come to a resting place , to the land the Lord your God will give you as your own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	10	But soon you will cross the Jordan River to live in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own , where he will give you rest from all your enemies and you will live in safety .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	11	Then the Lord your God will choose a place where he is to be worshiped . To that place you must bring everything I tell you : your burnt offerings and sacrifices , your offerings of a tenth of what you gain , your special gifts , and all your best things you promised to the Lord .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	13	Be careful that you don ’ t sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you please .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	14	Offer them only in the place the Lord will choose . He will choose a place in one of your tribes , and there you must do everything I am commanding you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	15	But you may kill your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want , as if it were a deer or a gazelle ; this is the blessing the Lord your God is giving you . Anyone , clean or unclean , may eat this meat ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	16	but do not eat the blood . Pour it out on the ground like water .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	17	Do not eat in your own towns what belongs to the Lord : one-tenth of your grain , new wine , or oil ; the first animals born to your herds or flocks ; whatever you have promised to give ; the special gifts you want to give to the Lord , or any other gifts .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	18	Eat these things when you are together with the Lord your God , in the place the Lord your God chooses to be worshiped . Everyone must do this : you , your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , and the Levites from your towns . Rejoice in the Lord your God ’ s presence about the things you have worked for .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	19	Be careful not to forget the Levites as long as you live in the land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	20	When the Lord your God enlarges your country as he has promised , and you want some meat so you say , “ I want some meat , ” you may eat as much meat as you want .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	21	If the Lord your God chooses a place where he is to be worshiped that is too far away from you , you may kill animals from your herds and flocks , which the Lord has given to you . I have commanded that you may do this . You may eat as much of them as you want in your own towns ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	22	as you would eat gazelle or deer meat . Both clean and unclean people may eat this meat ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	23	but be sure you don ’ t eat the blood , because the life is in the blood . Don ’ t eat the life with the meat .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	24	Don ’ t eat the blood , but pour it out on the ground like water .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	25	If you don ’ t eat it , things will go well for you and your children , because you will be doing what the Lord says is right .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	26	Take your holy things and the things you have promised to give , and go to the place the Lord will choose .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	27	Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God , both the meat and the blood . The blood of your sacrifices should be poured beside the altar of the Lord your God , but you may eat the meat .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	28	Be careful to obey all the rules I am giving you so that things will always go well for you and your children , and you will be doing what the Lord your God says is good and right .
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	29	You will enter the land and take it away from the nations that the Lord your God will destroy ahead of you . When you force them out and live in their land ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	30	they will be destroyed for you , but be careful not to be trapped by asking about their gods . Don ’ t say , “ How do these nations worship ? I will do the same. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	12	31	Don ’ t worship the Lord your God that way , because the Lord hates the evil ways they worship their gods . They even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to their gods !

NCV	Deuteronomy	13	2	The miracle or sign might even happen , and then they might say , “ Let ’ s serve other gods ” ( gods you have not known ) “ and let ’ s worship them. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	3	But you must not listen to those prophets or dreamers . The Lord your God is testing you , to find out if you love him with your whole being .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	4	Serve only the Lord your God . Respect him , keep his commands , and obey him . Serve him and be loyal to him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	5	The prophets or dreamers must be killed , because they said you should turn against the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt and saved you from the land where you were slaves . They tried to turn you from doing what the Lord your God commanded you to do . You must get rid of the evil among you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	6	Someone might try to lead you to serve other gods—it might be your brother , your son or daughter , the wife you love , or a close friend . The person might say , “ Let ’ s go and worship other gods. ” ( These are gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	7	gods of the people who live around you , either nearby or far away , from one end of the land to the other . )
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	8	Do not give in to such people . Do not listen or feel sorry for them , and do not let them go free or protect them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	9	You must put them to death . You must be the first one to start to kill them , and then everyone else must join in .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	10	You must throw stones at them until they die , because they tried to turn you away from the Lord your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , where you were slaves .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	11	Then everyone in Israel will hear about this and be afraid , and no one among you will ever do such an evil thing again . Cities to Destroy
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	12	The Lord your God is giving you cities in which to live , and you might hear something about one of them . Someone might say
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	14	Then you must ask about it , looking into the matter and checking carefully whether it is true . If it is proved that a hateful thing has happened among you ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	15	you must kill with a sword everyone who lives in that city . Destroy the city completely and kill everyone in it , as well as the animals , with a sword .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	16	Gather up everything those people owned , and put it in the middle of the city square . Then completely burn the city and everything they owned as a burnt offering to the Lord your God . That city should never be rebuilt ; let it be ruined forever .
NCV	Deuteronomy	13	17	Don ’ t keep for yourselves any of the things found in that city , so the Lord will not be angry anymore . He will give you mercy and feel sorry for you , and he will make your nation grow larger , as he promised to your ancestors .

There , where you will be together with the Lord , eat the tenth of your grain , new wine , and oil , and eat the animals born first to your herds and flocks . Do this so that you will learn to respect the Lord your God always .
NCV	Deuteronomy	14	24	But if the place the Lord will choose to be worshiped is too far away and he has blessed you so much you can not carry a tenth ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	14	25	exchange your one-tenth for silver . Then take the silver with you to the place the Lord your God shall choose .
NCV	Deuteronomy	14	26	Use the silver to buy anything you wish—cattle , sheep , wine , beer , or anything you wish . Then you and your family will eat and celebrate there before the Lord your God .
NCV	Deuteronomy	14	27	Do not forget the Levites in your town , because they have no land of their own among you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	14	28	At the end of every third year , everyone should bring one-tenth of that year ’ s crop and store it in your towns .
NCV	Deuteronomy	14	29	This is for the Levites so they may eat and be full .

NCV	Deuteronomy	15	15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt , and the Lord your God saved you . That is why I am commanding this to you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	2	This is how you must do it : Everyone who has loaned money must cancel the loan and not make a neighbor or relative pay it back . This is the Lord ’ s time for canceling what people owe .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	3	You may make a foreigner pay what is owed to you , but you must not collect what another Israelite owes you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	4	But there should be no poor people among you , because the Lord your God will richly bless you in the land he is giving you as your own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	5	He will bless you if you obey the Lord your God completely , but you must be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	6	The Lord your God will bless you as he promised , and you will lend to other nations , but you will not need to borrow from them . You will rule over many nations , but none will rule over you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	7	If there are poor among you , in one of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you , do not be selfish or greedy toward them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	8	But give freely to them , and freely lend them whatever they need .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	9	Beware of evil thoughts . Don ’ t think , “ The seventh year is near , the year to cancel what people owe. ” You might be mean to the needy and not give them anything . Then they will complain to the Lord about you , and he will find you guilty of sin .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	10	Give freely to the poor person , and do not wish that you didn ’ t have to give . The Lord your God will bless your work and everything you touch .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	11	There will always be poor people in the land , so I command you to give freely to your neighbors and to the poor and needy in your land . Letting Slaves Go Free
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	12	If one of your own people sells himself to you as a slave , whether it is a Hebrew man or woman , that person will serve you for six years . But in the seventh year you must let the slave go free .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	13	When you let slaves go , don ’ t send them away without anything .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	14	Give them some of your flock , your grain , and your wine , giving to them as the Lord has given to you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	16	But if your slave says to you , “ I don ’ t want to leave you , ” because he loves you and your family and has a good life with you ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	17	stick an awl [ a ] through his ear into the door ; he will be your slave for life . Also do this to a female slave .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	18	Do not think of it as a hard thing when you let your slaves go free . After all , they served you six years and did twice the work of a hired person . The Lord your God will bless you in everything you do . Rules About Firstborn Animals
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	19	Save all the first male animals born to your herds and flocks . They are for the Lord your God . Do not work the first calf born to your oxen , and do not cut off the wool from the first lamb born to your sheep .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	20	Each year you and your family are to eat these animals in the presence of the Lord your God , in the place he will choose to be worshiped .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	21	If an animal is crippled or blind or has something else wrong , do not sacrifice it to the Lord your God .
NCV	Deuteronomy	15	22	But you may eat that animal in your own town . Both clean and unclean people may eat it , as they would eat a gazelle or a deer .

NCV	Deuteronomy	16	16	All your men must come before the Lord three times a year to the place he will choose . They must come at these times : the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Weeks , and the Feast of Shelters . No man should come before the Lord without a gift .
NCV	Deuteronomy	16	2	As the sacrifice for the Passover to the Lord your God , offer an animal from your flock or herd at the place the Lord will choose to be worshiped .
NCV	Deuteronomy	16	3	Do not eat it with bread made with yeast . But for seven days eat bread made without yeast , the bread of suffering , because you left Egypt in a hurry . So all your life you will remember the time you left Egypt .
NCV	Deuteronomy	16	4	There must be no yeast anywhere in your land for seven days . Offer the sacrifice on the evening of the first day , and eat all the meat before morning ; do not leave it overnight .
NCV	Deuteronomy	16	5	Do not offer the Passover sacrifice in just any town the Lord your God gives you ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	16	6	but offer it in the place he will choose to be worshiped . Offer it in the evening as the sun goes down , which is when you left Egypt .

NCV	Deuteronomy	18	15	The Lord your God will give you a prophet like me , who is one of your own people . Listen to him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	18	16	This is what you asked the Lord your God to do when you were gathered at Mount Sinai . You said , “ Don ’ t make us listen to the voice of the Lord our God again , and don ’ t make us look at this terrible fire anymore , or we will die. ”

NCV	Deuteronomy	18	21	You might be thinking , “ How can we know if a message is not from the Lord ? ”

NCV	Deuteronomy	19	19	must be punished . He must be punished in the same way the other person would have been punished . You must get rid of the evil among you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	2	Then choose three cities in the middle of the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	3	Build roads to these cities , and divide the land the Lord is giving you into three parts so that someone who kills another person may run to these cities .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	4	This is the rule for someone who kills another person and runs to one of these cities in order to save his life . But the person must have killed a neighbor without meaning to , not out of hatred .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	5	For example , suppose someone goes into the forest with a neighbor to cut wood and swings an ax to cut down a tree . If the ax head flies off the handle , hitting and killing the neighbor , the one who killed him may run to one of these cities to save his life .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	6	Otherwise , the dead person ’ s relative who has the duty of punishing a murderer might be angry and chase him . If the city is far away , the relative might catch and kill the person , even though he should not be killed because there was no intent to kill his neighbor .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	7	This is why I command you to choose these three cities . 8-9 Carefully obey all these laws I ’ m giving you today . Love the Lord your God , and always do what he wants you to do . Then the Lord your God will enlarge your land as he promised your ancestors , giving you the whole land he promised to them . After that , choose three more cities of safety
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	10	so that innocent people will not be killed in your land , the land that the Lord your God is giving you as your own . By doing this you will not be guilty of allowing the death of innocent people .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	11	But if a person hates his neighbor and , after hiding and waiting , attacks and kills him and then runs to one of these cities for safety ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	12	the elders of his own city should send for the murderer . They should bring the person back from the city of safety and hand him over to the relative who has the duty of punishing the murderer .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	13	Show no mercy . You must remove from Israel the guilt of murdering innocent people so that things will go well for you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	14	Do not move the stone that marks the border of your neighbor ’ s land , which people long ago set in place . It marks what you inherit in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own . Rules About Witnesses
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	15	One witness is not enough to accuse a person of a crime or sin . A case must be proved by two or three witnesses .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	16	If a witness lies and accuses a person of a crime ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	17	the two people who are arguing must stand in the presence of the Lord before the priests and judges who are on duty .
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	18	The judges must check the matter carefully . The witness who is a liar , lying about a fellow Israelite ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	19	20	The rest of the people will hear about this and be afraid , and no one among you will ever do such an evil thing again .

NCV	Deuteronomy	20	2	The priest must come and speak to the army before you go into battle .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	3	He will say , “ Listen , Israel ! Today you are going into battle against your enemies . Don ’ t lose your courage or be afraid . Don ’ t panic or be frightened ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	4	because the Lord your God goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies and to save you. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	5	The officers should say to the army , “ Has anyone built a new house but not given it to God ? He may go home , because he might die in battle and someone else would get to give his house to God .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	6	Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it ? He may go home , because he might die in battle and someone else would enjoy his vineyard .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	7	Is any man engaged to a woman and not yet married to her ? He may go home , because he might die in battle and someone else would marry her. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	8	Then the officers should also say , “ Is anyone here afraid ? Has anyone lost his courage ? He may go home so that he will not cause others to lose their courage , too. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	9	When the officers finish speaking to the army , they should appoint commanders to lead it .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	10	When you march up to attack a city , first make them an offer of peace .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	11	If they accept your offer and open their gates to you , all the people of that city will become your slaves and work for you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	12	But if they do not make peace with you and fight you in battle , you should surround that city .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	13	The Lord your God will give it to you . Then kill all the men with your swords ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	14	and you may take everything else in the city for yourselves . Take the women , children , and animals , and you may use these things the Lord your God gives you from your enemies .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	15	Do this to all the cities that are far away , that do not belong to the nations nearby .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	16	But leave nothing alive in the cities of the land the Lord your God is giving you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	17	Completely destroy these people : the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites , as the Lord your God has commanded .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	18	Otherwise , they will teach you what they do for their gods , and if you do these hateful things , you will sin against the Lord your God .
NCV	Deuteronomy	20	19	If you surround and attack a city for a long time , trying to capture it , do not destroy its trees with an ax . You can eat the fruit from the trees , but do not cut them down . These trees are not the enemy , so don ’ t make war against them .

NCV	Deuteronomy	21	21	Then all the men in his town must throw stones at him until he dies . Get rid of the evil among you , because then all the people of Israel will hear about this and be afraid . Other Laws
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	2	Your elders and judges should go to where the body was found , and they should measure how far it is to the nearby cities .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	3	The elders of the city nearest the body must take a young cow that has never worked or worn a yoke ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	4	and they must lead her down to a valley that has never been plowed or planted , with a stream flowing through it . There they must break the young cow ’ s neck .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	5	The priests , the sons of Levi , should come forward , because they have been chosen by the Lord your God to serve him and to give blessings in the Lord ’ s name . They are the ones who decide cases of quarreling and attacks .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	6	Then all the elders of the city nearest the murdered person should wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken in the valley .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	7	They should declare : “ We did not kill this person , and we did not see it happen .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	8	Lord , remove this sin from your people Israel , whom you have saved . Don ’ t blame your people , the Israelites , for the murder of this innocent person. ” And so the murder will be paid for .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	9	Then you will have removed from yourselves the guilt of murdering an innocent person , because you will be doing what the Lord says is right . Captive Women as Wives
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	10	When you go to war against your enemies , the Lord will help you defeat them so that you will take them captive .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	11	If you see a beautiful woman among the captives and are attracted to her , you may take her as your wife .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	12	Bring her into your home , where she must shave her head and cut her nails
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	13	and change the clothes she was wearing when you captured her . After she has lived in your house and cried for her parents for a month , you may marry her . You will be her husband , and she will be your wife .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	14	But if you are not pleased with her , you must let her go anywhere she wants . You must not sell her for money or make her a slave , because you have taken away her honor . The Oldest Son
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	15	A man might have two wives , one he loves and one he doesn ’ t . Both wives might have sons by him . If the older son belongs to the wife he does not love ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	16	when that man wills his property to his sons he must not give the son of the wife he loves what belongs to the older son , the son of the wife he does not love .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	17	He must agree to give the older son two shares of everything he owns , even though the older son is from the wife he does not love . That son was the first to prove his father could have children , so he has the rights that belong to the older son . Sons Who Refuse to Obey
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	18	If someone has a son who is stubborn , who turns against his father and mother and doesn ’ t obey them or listen when they correct him ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	19	his parents must take him to the elders at the city gate .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	20	They will say to the elders , “ Our son is stubborn and turns against us . He will not obey us . He eats too much , and he is always drunk. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	22	If someone is guilty of a sin worthy of death , he must be put to death and his body displayed on a tree .
NCV	Deuteronomy	21	23	But don ’ t leave his body hanging on the tree overnight ; be sure to bury him that same day , because anyone whose body is displayed on a tree is cursed by God .

NCV	Deuteronomy	22	13	If a man marries a girl and has sexual relations with her but then decides he does not like her ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	14	he might talk badly about her and give her a bad name . He might say , “ I married this woman , but when I had sexual relations with her , I did not find that she was a virgin. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	15	Then the girl ’ s parents must bring proof that she was a virgin to the elders at the city gate .
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	16	The girl ’ s father will say to the elders , “ I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife , but now he does not want her .
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	17	This man has told lies about my daughter . He has said , ‘ I did not find your daughter to be a virgin , ’ but here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin. ” Then her parents are to show the sheet to the elders of the city ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	18	and the elders must take the man and punish him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	19	They must make him pay about two and one-half pounds of silver to the girl ’ s father , because the man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name . The girl will continue to be the man ’ s wife , and he may not divorce her as long as he lives .

NCV	Deuteronomy	22	25	But if a man meets an engaged girl out in the country and forces her to have sexual relations with him , only the man who had sexual relations with her must be put to death .
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	26	Don ’ t do anything to the girl , because she has not done a sin worthy of death . This is like the person who attacks and murders a neighbor ;
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	27	the man found the engaged girl in the country and she screamed , but no one was there to save her .
NCV	Deuteronomy	22	28	If a man meets a virgin who is not engaged to be married and forces her to have sexual relations with him and people find out about it ,

NCV	Deuteronomy	23	3	No Ammonite or Moabite may come into the meeting to worship the Lord , and none of their descendants for ten generations may come in .
NCV	Deuteronomy	23	4	This is because the Ammonites and Moabites did not give you bread and water when you came out of Egypt . And they hired Balaam son of Beor , from Pethor in Northwest Mesopotamia , to put a curse on you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	23	5	But the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam . He turned the curse into a blessing for you , because the Lord your God loves you .

NCV	Deuteronomy	26	14	I have not eaten any of the holy part while I was in sorrow . I have not removed any of it while I was unclean , and I have not offered it for dead people . I have obeyed you , the Lord my God , and have done everything you commanded me .

NCV	Deuteronomy	29	4	But to this day the Lord has not given you a mind that understands ; you don ’ t really understand what you see with your eyes or hear with your ears .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	5	I led you through the desert for forty years , and during that time neither your clothes nor sandals wore out .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	6	You ate no bread and drank no wine or beer . This was so you would understand that I am the Lord your God .

NCV	Deuteronomy	29	19	These are the kind of people who hear these curses but bless themselves , thinking , “ We will be safe even though we continue doing what we want to do. ” Those people may destroy all of your land , both wet and dry .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	20	The Lord will not forgive them . His anger will be like a burning fire against those people , and all the curses written in this book will come on them . The Lord will destroy any memory of them on the earth .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	21	He will separate them from all the tribes of Israel for punishment . All the curses of the Agreement that are written in this Book of the Teachings will happen to them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	22	Your children who will come after you , as well as foreigners from faraway lands , will see the disasters that come to this land and the diseases the Lord will send on it . They will say ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	23	“ The land is nothing but burning cinders and salt . Nothing is planted , nothing grows , and nothing blooms . It is like Sodom and Gomorrah , and Admah and Zeboiim , which the Lord destroyed because he was very angry. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	24	All the other nations will ask , “ Why has the Lord done this to the land ? Why is he so angry ? ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	25	And the answer will be , “ It is because the people broke the Agreement of the Lord , the God of their ancestors , which he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	26	They went and served other gods and bowed down to gods they did not even know . The Lord did not allow that ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	27	so he became very angry at the land and brought all the curses on it that are written in this book .
NCV	Deuteronomy	29	28	Since the Lord became angry and furious with them , he took them out of their land and put them in another land where they are today. ”

NCV	Deuteronomy	30	8	And you will again obey the Lord , keeping all his commands that I give you today .
NCV	Deuteronomy	30	9	The Lord your God will make you successful in everything you do . You will have many children , your cattle will have many calves , and your fields will produce good crops , because the Lord will again be happy with you , just as he was with your ancestors .
NCV	Deuteronomy	30	10	But you must obey the Lord your God by keeping all his commands and rules that are written in this Book of the Teachings . You must return to the Lord your God with your whole being . Choose Life or Death

NCV	Deuteronomy	30	12	It is not up in heaven . You do not have to ask , “ Who will go up to heaven and get it for us so we can obey it and keep it ? ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	30	13	It is not on the other side of the sea . You do not have to ask , “ Who will go across the sea and get it ? Who will tell it to us so we can keep it ? ”

NCV	Deuteronomy	31	31	Then Moses went and spoke these words to all the Israelites :
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	2	“ I am now one hundred twenty years old , and I can not lead you anymore . The Lord told me I would not cross the Jordan River ;
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	3	the Lord your God will lead you across himself . He will destroy those nations for you , and you will take over their land . Joshua will also lead you across , as the Lord has said .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	4	The Lord will do to those nations what he did to Sihon and Og , the kings of the Amorites , when he destroyed them and their land .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	5	The Lord will give those nations to you ; do to them everything I told you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid of them and don ’ t be frightened , because the Lord your God will go with you . He will not leave you or forget you. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in front of the people , “ Be strong and brave , because you will lead these people into the land the Lord promised to give their ancestors , and help them take it as their own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	8	The Lord himself will go before you . He will be with you ; he will not leave you or forget you . Don ’ t be afraid and don ’ t worry. ” Moses Writes the Teachings
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	9	So Moses wrote down these teachings and gave them to the priests and all the elders of Israel . ( The priests are the sons of Levi , who carry the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord . ) 10-11 Then Moses commanded them : “ Read these teachings for all Israel to hear at the end of every seven years , which is the year to cancel what people owe . Do it during the Feast of Shelters , when all the Israelites will come to appear before the Lord your God and stand at the place he will choose .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	12	Gather all the people : the men , women , children , and foreigners living in your towns so that they can listen and learn to respect the Lord your God and carefully obey everything in this law .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	13	Since their children do not know this law , they must hear it . They must learn to respect the Lord your God for as long as they live in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to take for your own. ” The Lord Calls Moses and Joshua
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	14	The Lord said to Moses , “ Soon you will die . Get Joshua and come to the Meeting Tent so that I may command him. ” So Moses and Joshua went to the Meeting Tent .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	15	The Lord appeared at the Meeting Tent in a cloud ; the cloud stood over the entrance of the Tent .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	16	And the Lord said to Moses , “ You will soon die . Then these people will not be loyal to me but will worship the foreign gods of the land they are entering . They will leave me , breaking the Agreement I made with them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	17	Then I will become very angry at them , and I will leave them . I will turn away from them , and they will be destroyed . Many terrible things will happen to them . Then they will say , ‘ It is because God is not with us that these terrible things are happening. ’
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	18	I will surely turn away from them then , because they have done wrong and have turned to other gods .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites . Then have them sing it , because it will be my witness against them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	20	When I bring them into the land I promised to their ancestors , a fertile land , they will eat as much as they want and get fat . Then they will turn to other gods and serve them . They will reject me and break my Agreement .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	21	Then when many troubles and terrible things happen to them , this song will testify against them , because the song will not be forgotten by their descendants . I know what they plan to do , even before I take them into the land I promised them. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	22	So Moses wrote down the song that day , and he taught it to the Israelites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	23	Then the Lord gave this command to Joshua son of Nun : “ Be strong and brave , because you will lead the people of Israel to the land I promised them , and I will be with you. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	24	After Moses finished writing all the words of the teachings in a book ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	25	he gave a command to the Levites , who carried the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	26	He said , “ Take this Book of the Teachings and put it beside the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord your God . It must stay there as a witness against you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	27	I know how stubborn and disobedient you are . You have disobeyed the Lord while I am alive and with you , and you will disobey even more after I die !
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	28	Gather all the elders of your tribes and all your officers to me so that I may say these things for them to hear , and so that I may ask heaven and earth to testify against them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	31	29	I know that after I die you will become completely evil . You will turn away from the commands I have given you . Terrible things will happen to you in the future when you do what the Lord says is evil , and you will make him angry with the idols you have made. ” Moses ’ Song

NCV	Deuteronomy	31	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	32	Their vine comes from Sodom , and their fields are like Gomorrah . Their grapes are full of poison ; their bunches of grapes are bitter .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	2	My teaching will drop like rain ; my words will fall like dew . They will be like showers on the grass ; they will pour down like rain on young plants .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	3	I will announce the name of the Lord . Praise God because he is great !
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	4	He is like a rock ; what he does is perfect , and he is always fair . He is a faithful God who does no wrong , who is right and fair .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	5	They have done evil against him . To their shame they are no longer his children ; they are an evil and lying people .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	6	This is not the way to repay the Lord , you foolish and unwise people . He is your Father and Maker , who made you and formed you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the old days . Think of the years already passed . Ask your father and he will tell you ; ask your elders and they will inform you .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	8	God Most High gave the nations their lands , dividing up the human race . He set up borders for the people and even numbered the Israelites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	9	The Lord took his people as his share , the people of Jacob as his very own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	10	He found them in a desert , a windy , empty land . He surrounded them and brought them up , guarding them as those he loved very much .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	11	He was like an eagle building its nest that flutters over its young . It spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its feathers .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	12	The Lord alone led them , and there was no foreign god helping him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	13	The Lord brought them to the heights of the land and fed them the fruit of the fields . He gave them honey from the rocks , bringing oil from the solid rock .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	14	There were milk curds from the cows and milk from the flock ; there were fat sheep and goats . There were sheep and goats from Bashan and the best of the wheat . You drank the juice of grapes .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	15	Israel grew fat and kicked ; they were fat and full and firm . They left the God who made them and rejected the Rock who saved them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	16	They made God jealous with foreign gods and angry with hateful idols .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	17	They made sacrifices to demons , not God , to gods they had never known , new gods from nearby , gods your ancestors did not fear .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	18	You left God who is the Rock , your Father , and you forgot the God who gave you birth .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	19	The Lord saw this and rejected them ; his sons and daughters had made him angry .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	20	He said , “ I will turn away from them and see what will happen to them . They are evil people , unfaithful children .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	21	They used things that are not gods to make me jealous and worthless idols to make me angry . So I will use those who are not a nation to make them jealous ; I will use a nation that does not understand to make them angry .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	22	My anger has started a fire that burns down to the place of the dead . It will burn up the ground and its crops , and it will set fire to the base of the mountains .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	23	“ I will pile troubles upon them and shoot my arrows at them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	24	They will be starved and sick , destroyed by terrible diseases . I will send them vicious animals and gliding , poisonous snakes .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	25	In the streets the sword will kill ; in their homes there will be terror . Young men and women will die , and so will babies and gray-haired men .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	26	I will scatter them as I said , and no one will remember them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	27	But I didn ’ t want their enemy to brag ; their enemy might misunderstand and say , ‘ We have won ! The Lord has done none of this. ’ ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	28	Israel has no sense ; they do not understand .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	29	I wish they were wise and understood this ; I wish they could see what will happen to them .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	30	One person can not chase a thousand people , and two people can not fight ten thousand unless their Rock has sold them , unless the Lord has given them up .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	31	The rock of these people is not like our Rock ; our enemies agree to that .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is like snake poison , like the deadly poison of cobras .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	34	“ I have been saving this , and I have it locked in my storehouses .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	35	I will punish those who do wrong ; I will repay them . Soon their foot will slip , because their day of trouble is near , and their punishment will come quickly. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	36	The Lord will defend his people and have mercy on his servants . He will see that their strength is gone , that nobody is left , slaves or free .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	37	Then he will say , “ Where are their gods ? Where is the rock they trusted ?
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	38	Who ate the fat from their sacrifices , and who drank the wine of their drink offerings ? Let those gods come to help you ! Let them protect you !
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	39	“ Now you will see that I am the one God ! There is no god but me . I send life and death ; I can hurt , and I can heal . No one can escape from me .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	40	I raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise : As surely as I live forever ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	41	I will sharpen my flashing sword , and I will take it in my hand to judge . I will punish my enemies and pay back those who hate me .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	42	My arrows will be covered with their blood ; my sword will eat their flesh . The blood will flow from those who are killed and the captives . The heads of the enemy leaders will be cut off. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	43	Be happy , nations , with his people , because he will repay you for the blood of his servants . He will punish his enemies , and he will remove the sin of his land and people .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	44	Moses came with Joshua son of Nun , and they spoke all the words of this song for the people to hear .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	45	When Moses finished speaking these words to all Israel ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	46	he said to them : “ Pay careful attention to all the words I have said to you today , and command your children to obey carefully everything in these teachings .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	47	These should not be unimportant words for you , but rather they mean life for you ! By these words you will live a long time in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to take as your own. ” Moses Goes Up to Mount Nebo
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	48	The Lord spoke to Moses again that same day and said ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Go up the Abarim Mountains , to Mount Nebo in the country of Moab , across from Jericho . Look at the land of Canaan that I am giving to the Israelites as their own .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	50	On that mountain that you climb , you will die and join your ancestors , just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	51	You both sinned against me at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin , and you did not honor me as holy there among the Israelites .
NCV	Deuteronomy	32	52	So now you will only look at the land from far away . You will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Deuteronomy	33	33	Moses , the man of God , gave this blessing to the Israelites before he died .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	2	He said : “ The Lord came from Mount Sinai and rose like the sun from Edom ; he showed his greatness from Mount Paran . He came with thousands of angels from the southern mountains .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	3	The Lord surely loves his people and takes care of all those who belong to him . They bow down at his feet , and they are taught by him .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	4	Moses gave us the teachings that belong to the people of Jacob .

NCV	Deuteronomy	33	8	Moses said this about the people of Levi : “ Lord , your Thummim and Urim belong to Levi , whom you love . Lord , you tested him at Massah and argued with him at the waters of Meribah .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	9	He said about his father and mother , ‘ I don ’ t care about them. ’ He did not treat his brothers as favorites or give special favors to his children , but he protected your word and guarded your agreement .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	10	He teaches your laws to the people of Jacob and your teachings to the people of Israel . He burns incense before you and makes whole burnt offerings on your altar .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	11	Lord , make them strong ; be pleased with the work they do . Defeat those who attack them , and don ’ t let their enemies rise up again. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	12	Moses said this about the people of Benjamin : “ The Lord ’ s loved ones will lie down in safety , because he protects them all day long . The ones he loves rest with him. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	13	Moses said this about the people of Joseph : “ May the Lord bless their land with wonderful dew from heaven , with water from the springs below ,
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	14	with the best fruits that the sun brings , and with the best fruits that the moon brings .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	15	Let the old mountains give the finest crops , and let the everlasting hills give the best fruits .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	16	Let the full earth give the best fruits , and let the Lord who lived in the burning bush be pleased . May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph , on the forehead of the one who was blessed among his brothers .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	17	Joseph has the majesty of a firstborn bull ; he is as strong as a wild ox . He will stab other nations , even those nations far away . These are the ten thousands of Ephraim , and these are the thousands of Manasseh. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	18	Moses said this about the people of Zebulun : “ Be happy when you go out , Zebulun , and be happy in your tents , Issachar .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	19	They will call the people to the mountain , and there they will offer the right sacrifices . They will do well from all that is in the sea , and they will do well from the treasures hidden in the sand on the shore. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	20	Moses said this about the people of Gad : “ Praise God who gives Gad more land ! Gad lives there like a lion , who tears off arms and heads .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	21	They chose the best land for themselves . They received a large share , like that given to an officer . When the leaders of the people gathered , the people of Gad did what the Lord said was right , and they judged Israel fairly. ”
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	22	Moses said this about the people of Dan : “ Dan is like a lion ’ s cub , who jumps out of Bashan. ”

NCV	Deuteronomy	33	25	Your gates will have locks of iron and bronze , and you will be strong as long as you live .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	26	“ There is no one like the God of Israel , who rides through the skies to help you , who rides on the clouds in his majesty .

NCV	Deuteronomy	33	28	The people of Israel will lie down in safety . Jacob ’ s spring is theirs alone . Theirs is a land full of grain and new wine , where the skies drop their dew .
NCV	Deuteronomy	33	29	Israel , you are blessed ! No one else is like you , because you are a people saved by the Lord . He is your shield and helper , your glorious sword .

NCV	Deuteronomy	34	34	Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Mount Pisgah , across from Jericho . From there the Lord showed him all the land from Gilead to Dan ,

NCV	Deuteronomy	34	3	as well as the southern desert and the whole Valley of Jericho up to Zoar . ( Jericho is called the city of palm trees . )

NCV	Deuteronomy	34	5	Then Moses , the servant of the Lord , died there in Moab , as the Lord had said .

NCV	Joshua	1	2	The Lord said , “ My servant Moses is dead . Now you and all these people go across the Jordan River into the land I am giving to the Israelites .
NCV	Joshua	1	3	I promised Moses I would give you this land , so I will give you every place you go in the land .
NCV	Joshua	1	4	All the land from the desert in the south to Lebanon in the north will be yours . All the land from the great river , the Euphrates , in the east , to the Mediterranean Sea in the west will be yours , too , including the land of the Hittites .

NCV	Joshua	1	11	“ Go through the camp and tell the people , ‘ Get your supplies ready . Three days from now you will cross the Jordan River and take the land the Lord your God is giving you. ’ ”
NCV	Joshua	1	12	Then Joshua said to the people of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh ,
NCV	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember what Moses , the servant of the Lord , told you . He said the Lord your God would give you rest and would give you this land .
NCV	Joshua	1	14	Now the Lord has given you this land east of the Jordan River . Your wives , children , and animals may stay here , but your fighting men must dress for war and cross the Jordan River ahead of your brothers to help them .
NCV	Joshua	1	15	The Lord has given you a place to rest and will do the same for your brothers . But you must help them until they take the land the Lord their God is giving them .

NCV	Joshua	1	16	Then the people answered Joshua , “ Anything you command us to do , we will do . Any place you send us , we will go .

NCV	Joshua	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Joshua	2	2	Someone told the king of Jericho , “ Some men from Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab : “ Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house . They have come to spy out our whole land. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	4	But the woman had hidden the two men . She said , “ They did come here , but I didn ’ t know where they came from .
NCV	Joshua	2	5	In the evening , when it was time to close the city gate , they left . I don ’ t know where they went , but if you go quickly , maybe you can catch them. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	6	( The woman had taken the men up to the roof [ a ] and had hidden them there under stalks of flax that she had spread out . )
NCV	Joshua	2	7	So the king ’ s men went out looking for the spies on the road that leads to the crossings of the Jordan River . The city gate was closed just after the king ’ s men left the city .
NCV	Joshua	2	8	Before the spies went to sleep for the night , Rahab went up to the roof .
NCV	Joshua	2	9	She said to them , “ I know the Lord has given this land to your people . You frighten us very much . Everyone living in this land is terribly afraid of you
NCV	Joshua	2	10	because we have heard how the Lord dried up the Red Sea when you came out of Egypt . We have heard how you destroyed Sihon and Og , two Amorite kings who lived east of the Jordan .
NCV	Joshua	2	11	When we heard this , we were very frightened . Now our men are afraid to fight you because the Lord your God rules the heavens above and the earth below !
NCV	Joshua	2	12	So now , promise me before the Lord that you will show kindness to my family just as I showed kindness to you . Give me some proof that you will do this .
NCV	Joshua	2	13	Allow my father , mother , brothers , sisters , and all of their families to live . Save us from death. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	14	The men agreed and said , “ It will be our lives for your lives if you don ’ t tell anyone what we are doing . When the Lord gives us the land , we will be kind and true to you. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	15	The house Rahab lived in was built on the city wall , so she used a rope to let the men down through a window .
NCV	Joshua	2	16	She said to them , “ Go into the hills so the king ’ s men will not find you . Hide there for three days . After the king ’ s men return , you may go on your way. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	17	The men said to her , “ You must do as we say . If not , we can not be responsible for keeping this oath you have made us swear .
NCV	Joshua	2	18	When we return to this land , you must tie this red rope in the window through which you let us down . Bring your father , mother , brothers , and all your family into your house .
NCV	Joshua	2	19	If anyone leaves your house and is killed , it is his own fault . We can not be responsible for him . If anyone in your house is hurt , we will be responsible .
NCV	Joshua	2	20	But if you tell anyone about this , we will be free from the oath you made us swear. ”
NCV	Joshua	2	21	Rahab answered , “ I agree to this. ” So she sent them away , and they left . Then she tied the red rope in the window .
NCV	Joshua	2	22	The men left and went into the hills where they stayed for three days . The king ’ s men looked for them all along the road , but after three days , they returned to the city without finding them .
NCV	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men started back . They left the hills and crossed the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them .

NCV	Joshua	3	3	and gave orders to the people : “ When you see the priests and Levites carrying the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord your God , leave where you are and follow it .
NCV	Joshua	3	2	After three days the officers went through the camp
NCV	Joshua	3	4	That way you will know which way to go since you have never been here before . But do not follow too closely . Stay about a thousand yards behind the Ark. ”
NCV	Joshua	3	5	Then Joshua told the people , “ Make yourselves holy , because tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among you. ”
NCV	Joshua	3	6	Joshua said to the priests , “ Take the Ark of the Agreement and go ahead of the people. ” So the priests lifted the Ark and carried it ahead of the people .
NCV	Joshua	3	7	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I will begin to make you great in the opinion of all the Israelites so the people will know I am with you just as I was with Moses .
NCV	Joshua	3	8	Tell the priests who carry the Ark of the Agreement to go to the edge of the Jordan River and stand in the water. ”
NCV	Joshua	3	9	Then Joshua said to the Israelites , “ Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God .
NCV	Joshua	3	10	Here is proof that the living God is with you and that he will force out the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites , and Jebusites .
NCV	Joshua	3	11	The Ark of the Agreement with the Lord of the whole world will go ahead of you into the Jordan River .
NCV	Joshua	3	12	Now choose twelve men from among you , one from each of the twelve tribes of Israel .
NCV	Joshua	3	13	The priests will carry the Ark of the Lord , the Master of the whole world , into the Jordan ahead of you . When they step into the water , it will stop . The river will stop flowing and will stand up in a heap. ”
NCV	Joshua	3	14	So the people left the place where they had camped , and they followed the priests who carried the Ark of the Agreement across the Jordan River .
NCV	Joshua	3	15	During harvest the Jordan overflows its banks . When the priests carrying the Ark came to the edge of the river and stepped into the water ,
NCV	Joshua	3	16	the water upstream stopped flowing . It stood up in a heap a great distance away at Adam , a town near Zarethan . The water flowing down to the Sea of Arabah ( the Dead Sea ) was completely cut off . So the people crossed the river near Jericho .
NCV	Joshua	3	17	The priests carried the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord to the middle of the river and stood there on dry ground . They waited there while all the people of Israel walked across the Jordan River on dry land . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	4	4	So Joshua chose one man from each tribe . Then he called the twelve men together
NCV	Joshua	4	2	“ Choose twelve men from among the people , one from each tribe .
NCV	Joshua	4	3	Tell them to get twelve rocks from the middle of the river , from where the priests stood . Carry the rocks and put them down where you stay tonight. ”
NCV	Joshua	4	5	and said to them , “ Go out into the river where the Ark of the Lord your God is . Each of you bring back one rock , one for each tribe of Israel , and carry it on your shoulder .
NCV	Joshua	4	6	They will be a sign among you . In the future your children will ask you , ‘ What do these rocks mean ? ’
NCV	Joshua	4	7	Tell them the water stopped flowing in the Jordan when the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord crossed the river . These rocks will always remind the Israelites of this. ”
NCV	Joshua	4	8	So the Israelites obeyed Joshua and carried twelve rocks from the middle of the Jordan River , one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel , just as the Lord had commanded Joshua . They carried the rocks with them and put them down where they made their camp .
NCV	Joshua	4	9	Joshua also put twelve rocks in the middle of the Jordan River where the priests had stood while carrying the Ark of the Agreement . These rocks are still there today .
NCV	Joshua	4	10	The priests carrying the Ark continued standing in the middle of the river until everything was done that the Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people , just as Moses had told Joshua . The people hurried across the river .
NCV	Joshua	4	11	After they finished crossing the river , the priests carried the Ark of the Lord to the other side as the people watched .
NCV	Joshua	4	12	The men from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh obeyed what Moses had told them . They were dressed for war , and they crossed the river ahead of the other people .
NCV	Joshua	4	13	About forty thousand soldiers prepared for war passed before the Lord as they marched across the river , going toward the plains of Jericho .
NCV	Joshua	4	14	That day the Lord made Joshua great in the opinion of all the Israelites . They respected Joshua all his life , just as they had respected Moses .
NCV	Joshua	4	15	Then the Lord said to Joshua ,
NCV	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests to bring the Ark of the Agreement out of the river. ”
NCV	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests , “ Come up out of the Jordan. ”
NCV	Joshua	4	18	Then the priests carried the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord out of the river . As soon as their feet touched dry land , the water began flowing again . The river again overflowed its banks , just as it had before they crossed .
NCV	Joshua	4	19	The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal , east of Jericho .
NCV	Joshua	4	20	They carried with them the twelve rocks taken from the Jordan , and Joshua set them up at Gilgal .
NCV	Joshua	4	21	Then he spoke to the Israelites : “ In the future your children will ask you , ‘ What do these rocks mean ? ’
NCV	Joshua	4	22	Tell them , ‘ Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry land .
NCV	Joshua	4	23	The Lord your God caused the water to stop flowing until you finished crossing it , just as the Lord did to the Red Sea . He stopped the water until we crossed it .
NCV	Joshua	4	24	The Lord did this so all people would know he has great power and so you would always respect the Lord your God. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	5	5	The men who had come out of Egypt had been circumcised , but none of those who were born in the desert on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised .
NCV	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , “ Make knives from flint stones and circumcise the Israelites. ”
NCV	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made knives from flint stones and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth .
NCV	Joshua	5	4	This is why Joshua circumcised the men : After the Israelites left Egypt , all the men old enough to serve in the army died in the desert on the way out of Egypt .
NCV	Joshua	5	6	The Israelites had moved about in the desert for forty years . During that time all the fighting men who had left Egypt had died because they had not obeyed the Lord . So the Lord swore they would not see the land he had promised their ancestors to give them , a fertile land .
NCV	Joshua	5	7	Their sons took their places . But none of the sons born on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised , so Joshua circumcised them .
NCV	Joshua	5	8	After all the Israelites had been circumcised , they stayed in camp until they were healed .
NCV	Joshua	5	9	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ As slaves in Egypt you were ashamed , but today I have removed that shame. ” So Joshua named that place Gilgal , which it is still named today .
NCV	Joshua	5	10	The people of Israel were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho . It was there , on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month , they celebrated the Passover Feast .
NCV	Joshua	5	11	The day after the Passover , the people ate food grown on that land : bread made without yeast and roasted grain .
NCV	Joshua	5	12	The day they ate this food , the manna stopped coming . The Israelites no longer got the manna from heaven . They ate the food grown in the land of Canaan that year .
NCV	Joshua	5	13	Joshua was near Jericho when he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a sword in his hand . Joshua went to him and asked , “ Are you a friend or an enemy ? ”
NCV	Joshua	5	14	The man answered , “ I am neither . I have come as the commander of the Lord ’ s army. ” Then Joshua bowed facedown on the ground and asked , “ Does my master have a command for me , his servant ? ”
NCV	Joshua	5	15	The commander of the Lord ’ s army answered , “ Take off your sandals , because the place where you are standing is holy. ” So Joshua did . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	6	6	So Joshua son of Nun called the priests together and said to them , “ Carry the Ark of the Agreement . Tell seven priests to carry trumpets and march in front of it. ”
NCV	Joshua	6	2	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Look , I have given you Jericho , its king , and all its fighting men .
NCV	Joshua	6	3	March around the city with your army once a day for six days .
NCV	Joshua	6	4	Have seven priests carry trumpets made from horns of male sheep and have them march in front of the Ark . On the seventh day march around the city seven times and have the priests blow the trumpets as they march .
NCV	Joshua	6	5	They will make one long blast on the trumpets . When you hear that sound , have all the people give a loud shout . Then the walls of the city will fall so the people can go straight into the city. ”
NCV	Joshua	6	7	Then Joshua ordered the people , “ Now go ! March around the city . The soldiers with weapons should march in front of the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord. ”
NCV	Joshua	6	8	When Joshua finished speaking to the people , the seven priests began marching before the Lord . They carried the seven trumpets and blew them as they marched . The priests carrying the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord followed them .
NCV	Joshua	6	9	Soldiers with weapons marched in front of the priests , and armed men walked behind the Ark . The priests were blowing their trumpets .
NCV	Joshua	6	10	But Joshua had told the people not to give a war cry . He said , “ Don ’ t shout . Don ’ t say a word until the day I tell you . Then shout. ”
NCV	Joshua	6	11	So Joshua had the Ark of the Lord carried around the city one time . Then they went back to camp for the night .
NCV	Joshua	6	12	Early the next morning Joshua got up , and the priests carried the Ark of the Lord again .
NCV	Joshua	6	13	The seven priests carried the seven trumpets and marched in front of the Ark of the Lord , blowing their trumpets . Soldiers with weapons marched in front of them , and other soldiers walked behind the Ark of the Lord . All this time the priests were blowing their trumpets .
NCV	Joshua	6	14	So on the second day they marched around the city one time and then went back to camp . They did this every day for six days .
NCV	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day they got up at dawn and marched around the city , just as they had on the days before . But on that day they marched around the city seven times .
NCV	Joshua	6	16	The seventh time around the priests blew their trumpets . Then Joshua gave the command : “ Now , shout ! The Lord has given you this city !
NCV	Joshua	6	17	The city and everything in it are to be destroyed as an offering to the Lord . Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone in her house should remain alive . They must not be killed , because Rahab hid the two spies we sent out .
NCV	Joshua	6	18	Don ’ t take any of the things that are to be destroyed as an offering to the Lord . If you take them and bring them into our camp , you yourselves will be destroyed , and you will bring trouble to all of Israel .
NCV	Joshua	6	19	All the silver and gold and things made from bronze and iron belong to the Lord and must be saved for him. ”
NCV	Joshua	6	20	When the priests blew the trumpets , the people shouted . At the sound of the trumpets and the people ’ s shout , the walls fell , and everyone ran straight into the city . So the Israelites defeated that city .
NCV	Joshua	6	21	They completely destroyed with the sword every living thing in the city—men and women , young and old , cattle , sheep , and donkeys .
NCV	Joshua	6	22	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land , “ Go into the prostitute ’ s house . Bring her out and bring out those who are with her , because of the promise you made to her. ”
NCV	Joshua	6	23	So the two men went into the house and brought out Rahab , her father , mother , brothers , and all those with her . They put all of her family in a safe place outside the camp of Israel .
NCV	Joshua	6	24	Then Israel burned the whole city and everything in it , but they did not burn the things made from silver , gold , bronze , and iron . These were saved for the Lord .
NCV	Joshua	6	25	Joshua saved Rahab the prostitute , her family , and all who were with her , because Rahab had helped the men he had sent to spy out Jericho . Rahab still lives among the Israelites today .
NCV	Joshua	6	26	Then Joshua made this oath : “ Anyone who tries to rebuild this city of Jericho will be cursed by the Lord . The one who lays the foundation of this city will lose his oldest son , and the one who sets up the gates will lose his youngest son. ”

NCV	Joshua	7	7	Then Joshua said , “ Lord God , you brought our people across the Jordan River . Why did you bring us this far and then let the Amorites destroy us ? We would have been happy to stay on the other side of the Jordan .
NCV	Joshua	7	2	Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai , which was near Beth Aven , east of Bethel . He told them , “ Go to Ai and spy out the area. ” So the men went to spy on Ai .
NCV	Joshua	7	3	Later they came back to Joshua and said , “ There are only a few people in Ai , so we will not need all our people to defeat them . Send only two or three thousand men to fight . There is no need to send all of our people. ”
NCV	Joshua	7	4	So about three thousand men went up to Ai , but the people of Ai beat them badly .
NCV	Joshua	7	5	The people of Ai killed about thirty-six Israelites and then chased the rest from the city gate all the way down to the canyon , killing them as they went down the hill . When the Israelites saw this , they lost their courage .
NCV	Joshua	7	6	Then Joshua tore his clothes in sorrow . He bowed facedown on the ground before the Ark of the Lord and stayed there until evening . The leaders of Israel did the same thing . They also threw dirt on their heads to show their sorrow .
NCV	Joshua	7	8	Lord , there is nothing I can say now . Israel has been beaten by the enemy .
NCV	Joshua	7	9	The Canaanites and all the other people in this country will hear about this and will surround and kill us all ! Then what will you do for your own great name ? ”
NCV	Joshua	7	10	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Stand up ! Why are you down on your face ?
NCV	Joshua	7	11	The Israelites have sinned ; they have broken the agreement I commanded them to obey . They took some of the things I commanded them to destroy . They have stolen and lied and have taken those things for themselves .
NCV	Joshua	7	12	That is why the Israelites can not face their enemies . They turn away from the fight and run , because I have commanded that they be destroyed . I will not help you anymore unless you destroy everything as I commanded you .
NCV	Joshua	7	13	“ Now go ! Make the people holy . Tell them , ‘ Set yourselves apart to the Lord for tomorrow . The Lord , the God of Israel , says some of you are keeping things he commanded you to destroy . You will never defeat your enemies until you throw away those things .
NCV	Joshua	7	14	“ ‘ Tomorrow morning you must be present with your tribes . The Lord will choose one tribe to stand alone before him . Then the Lord will choose one family group from that tribe to stand before him . Then the Lord will choose one family from that family group to stand before him , person by person .
NCV	Joshua	7	15	The one who is keeping what should have been destroyed will himself be destroyed by fire . Everything he owns will be destroyed with him . He has broken the agreement with the Lord and has done a disgraceful thing among the people of Israel ! ’ ”
NCV	Joshua	7	16	Early the next morning Joshua led all of Israel to present themselves in their tribes , and the Lord chose the tribe of Judah .
NCV	Joshua	7	17	So the family groups of Judah presented themselves , and the Lord then chose the family group of Zerah . When all the families of Zerah presented themselves , the family of Zabdi was chosen .
NCV	Joshua	7	18	And Joshua told all the men in that family to present themselves . The Lord chose Achan son of Carmi . ( Carmi was the son of Zabdi , who was the son of Zerah . )
NCV	Joshua	7	19	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , tell the truth . Confess to the Lord , the God of Israel . Tell me what you did , and don ’ t try to hide anything from me. ”
NCV	Joshua	7	20	Achan answered , “ It is true ! I have sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel . This is what I did :
NCV	Joshua	7	21	Among the things I saw was a beautiful coat from Babylonia and about five pounds of silver and more than one and one-fourth pounds of gold . I wanted these things very much for myself , so I took them . You will find them buried in the ground under my tent , with the silver underneath. ”
NCV	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent men who ran to the tent and found the things hidden there , with the silver .
NCV	Joshua	7	23	The men brought them out of the tent , took them to Joshua and all the Israelites , and spread them out on the ground before the Lord .
NCV	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua and all the people led Achan son of Zerah to the Valley of Trouble . They also took the silver , the coat , the gold , Achan ’ s sons , daughters , cattle , donkeys , sheep , tent , and everything he owned .
NCV	Joshua	7	25	Joshua said , “ I don ’ t know why you caused so much trouble for us , but now the Lord will bring trouble to you. ” Then all the people threw stones at Achan and his family until they died . Then the people burned them .
NCV	Joshua	7	26	They piled rocks over Achan ’ s body , and they are still there today . That is why it is called the Valley of Trouble . After this the Lord was no longer angry . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	8	8	After you take the city , burn it . See to it ! You have your orders. ”
NCV	Joshua	8	2	You will do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king . Only this time you may take all the wealth and keep it for yourselves . Now tell some of your soldiers to set up an ambush behind the city. ”
NCV	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua led his whole army toward Ai . Then he chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night .
NCV	Joshua	8	4	Joshua gave them these orders : “ Listen carefully . You must set up an ambush behind the city . Don ’ t go far from it , but continue to watch and be ready .
NCV	Joshua	8	5	I and the men who are with me will march toward the city , and the men in the city will come out to fight us , just as they did before . Then we will turn and run away from them .
NCV	Joshua	8	6	They will chase us away from the city , thinking we are running away from them as we did before . When we run away ,
NCV	Joshua	8	7	come out from your ambush and take the city . The Lord your God will give you the power to win .
NCV	Joshua	8	9	Then Joshua sent them to wait in ambush between Bethel and Ai , to the west of Ai . But Joshua stayed the night with his people .
NCV	Joshua	8	10	Early the next morning Joshua gathered his men together . He and the older leaders of Israel led them up to Ai .
NCV	Joshua	8	11	All of the soldiers who were with Joshua marched up to Ai and stopped in front of the city and made camp north of it . There was a valley between them and the city .
NCV	Joshua	8	12	Then Joshua chose about five thousand men and set them in ambush in the area west of the city between Bethel and Ai .
NCV	Joshua	8	13	So the people took their positions ; the main camp was north of the city , and the other men were hiding to the west . That night Joshua went down into the valley .
NCV	Joshua	8	14	Now when the king of Ai saw the army of Israel , he and his people got up early the next morning and hurried out to fight them . They went out to a place east of the city , but the king did not know soldiers were waiting in ambush behind the city .
NCV	Joshua	8	15	Joshua and all the men of Israel let the army of Ai push them back . Then they ran toward the desert .
NCV	Joshua	8	16	The men in Ai were called to chase Joshua and his men , so they left the city and went after them .
NCV	Joshua	8	17	All the men of Ai and Bethel chased the army of Israel . The city was left open ; not a man stayed to protect it .
NCV	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Hold your spear toward Ai , because I will give you that city. ” So Joshua held his spear toward the city of Ai .
NCV	Joshua	8	19	When the Israelites who were in ambush saw this , they quickly came out of their hiding place and hurried toward the city . They entered the city , took control of it , and quickly set it on fire .
NCV	Joshua	8	20	When the men of Ai looked back , they saw smoke rising from their city . At the same time the Israelites stopped running and turned against the men of Ai , who could not escape in any direction .
NCV	Joshua	8	21	When Joshua and all his men saw that the army had taken control of the city and saw the smoke rising from it , they stopped running and turned to fight the men of Ai .
NCV	Joshua	8	22	The men who were in ambush also came out of the city to help with the fight . So the men of Ai were caught between the armies of Israel . None of the enemy escaped . The Israelites fought until not one of the men of Ai was left alive , except
NCV	Joshua	8	23	the king of Ai , and they brought him to Joshua . A Review of the Fighting
NCV	Joshua	8	24	During the fighting the army of Israel chased the men of Ai into the fields and desert and killed all of them . Then they went back to Ai and killed everyone there .
NCV	Joshua	8	25	All the people of Ai died that day , twelve thousand men and women .
NCV	Joshua	8	26	Joshua had held his spear toward Ai , as a sign to destroy the city , and did not draw it back until all the people of Ai were destroyed .
NCV	Joshua	8	27	The people of Israel kept for themselves the animals and the other things the people of Ai had owned , as the Lord had commanded Joshua to do .
NCV	Joshua	8	28	Then Joshua burned the city of Ai and made it a pile of ruins . And it is still like that today .
NCV	Joshua	8	29	Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening . At sunset Joshua told his men to take the king ’ s body down from the tree and to throw it down at the city gate . Then they covered it with a pile of rocks , which is still there today .
NCV	Joshua	8	30	Joshua built an altar for the Lord , the God of Israel , on Mount Ebal , as
NCV	Joshua	8	31	Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , had commanded . Joshua built the altar as it was explained in the Book of the Teachings of Moses . It was made from uncut stones ; no tool was ever used on them . On that altar the Israelites offered burnt offerings to the Lord and fellowship offerings .
NCV	Joshua	8	32	There Joshua wrote the teachings of Moses on stones for all the people of Israel to see .
NCV	Joshua	8	33	The elders , officers , judges , and all the Israelites were there ; Israelites and non-Israelites were all standing around the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord in front of the priests , the Levites who had carried the Ark . Half of the people stood in front of Mount Ebal , and half stood in front of Mount Gerizim . This was the way the Lord ’ s servant Moses had earlier commanded the people to be blessed .
NCV	Joshua	8	34	Then Joshua read all the words of the teachings , the blessings and the curses , exactly as they were written in the Book of the Teachings .
NCV	Joshua	8	35	All the Israelites were gathered together—men , women , and children—along with the non-Israelites who lived among them . Joshua read every command that Moses had given . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	9	9	The men answered , “ We are your servants who have come from a far country , because we heard of the fame of the Lord your God . We heard about what he has done and everything he did in Egypt .
NCV	Joshua	9	2	So all these kings gathered to fight Joshua and the Israelites .
NCV	Joshua	9	3	When the people of Gibeon heard how Joshua had defeated Jericho and Ai ,
NCV	Joshua	9	4	they decided to trick the Israelites . They gathered old sacks and old leather wine bags that were cracked and mended , and they put them on the backs of their donkeys .
NCV	Joshua	9	5	They put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes , and they took some dry , moldy bread .
NCV	Joshua	9	6	Then they went to Joshua in the camp near Gilgal . The men said to Joshua and the Israelites , “ We have traveled from a faraway country . Make a peace agreement with us. ”
NCV	Joshua	9	7	The Israelites said to these Hivites , “ Maybe you live near us . How can we make a peace agreement with you ? ”
NCV	Joshua	9	8	The Hivites said to Joshua , “ We are your servants. ” But Joshua asked , “ Who are you ? Where do you come from ? ”
NCV	Joshua	9	10	We heard that he defeated the two kings of the Amorites from the east side of the Jordan River—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who ruled in Ashtaroth .
NCV	Joshua	9	11	So our elders and our people said to us , ‘ Take food for your journey and go and meet the Israelites . Tell them , “ We are your servants . Make a peace agreement with us. ” ’
NCV	Joshua	9	12	“ Look at our bread . On the day we left home to come to you it was warm and fresh , but now it is dry and moldy .
NCV	Joshua	9	13	Look at our leather wine bags . They were new and filled with wine , but now they are cracked and old . Our clothes and sandals are worn out from the long journey. ”
NCV	Joshua	9	14	The men of Israel tasted the bread , but they did not ask the Lord what to do .
NCV	Joshua	9	15	So Joshua agreed to make peace with the Gibeonites and to let them live . And the leaders of the Israelites swore an oath to keep the agreement .
NCV	Joshua	9	16	Three days after they had made the agreement , the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lived nearby .
NCV	Joshua	9	17	So the Israelites went to where they lived and on the third day came to their cities : Gibeon , Kephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath Jearim .
NCV	Joshua	9	18	But the Israelites did not attack those cities , because they had made a promise to them before the Lord , the God of Israel . All the Israelites grumbled against the leaders .
NCV	Joshua	9	19	But the leaders answered , “ We have given our promise before the Lord , the God of Israel , so we can not attack them now .
NCV	Joshua	9	20	This is what we must do . We must let them live . Otherwise , God ’ s anger will be against us for breaking the oath we swore to them .
NCV	Joshua	9	21	So let them live , but they will cut wood and carry water for our people. ” So the leaders kept their promise to them .
NCV	Joshua	9	22	Joshua called for the Gibeonites and asked , “ Why did you lie to us ? Your land was near our camp , but you told us you were from a far country .
NCV	Joshua	9	23	Now , you will be placed under a curse to be our slaves . You will have to cut wood and carry water for the house of my God. ”
NCV	Joshua	9	24	The Gibeonites answered Joshua , “ We lied to you because we were afraid you would kill us . We heard that the Lord your God commanded his servant Moses to give you all of this land and to kill all the people who lived in it . That is why we did this .
NCV	Joshua	9	25	Now you can decide what to do with us , whatever you think is right. ”
NCV	Joshua	9	26	So Joshua saved their lives by not allowing the Israelites to kill them ,
NCV	Joshua	9	27	but he made the Gibeonites slaves . They cut wood and carried water for the Israelites , and they did it for the altar of the Lord—wherever he chose it to be . They are still doing this today . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	10	10	The Lord confused those armies when Israel attacked , so Israel defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon . They chased them along the road going up to Beth Horon and killed men all the way to Azekah and Makkedah .
NCV	Joshua	10	2	Adoni-Zedek and his people were very afraid because of this . Gibeon was not a little town like Ai ; it was a large city , as big as a city that had a king , and all its men were good fighters .
NCV	Joshua	10	3	So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent a message to Hoham king of Hebron , Piram king of Jarmuth , Japhia king of Lachish , and Debir king of Eglon . He begged them ,
NCV	Joshua	10	4	“ Come with me and help me attack Gibeon , which has made a peace agreement with Joshua and the Israelites. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	5	Then these five Amorite kings—the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , and Eglon—gathered their armies , went to Gibeon , surrounded it , and attacked it .
NCV	Joshua	10	6	The Gibeonites sent this message to Joshua in his camp at Gilgal : “ Don ’ t let us , your servants , be destroyed . Come quickly and help us ! Save us ! All the Amorite kings from the mountains have joined their armies and are fighting against us. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua marched out of Gilgal with his whole army , including his best fighting men .
NCV	Joshua	10	8	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of those armies , because I will hand them over to you . None of them will be able to stand against you. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	9	Joshua and his army marched all night from Gilgal for a surprise attack .
NCV	Joshua	10	11	As they chased the enemy down the Beth Horon Pass to Azekah , the Lord threw large hailstones on them from the sky and killed them . More people were killed by the hailstones than by the Israelites ’ swords .
NCV	Joshua	10	12	On the day that the Lord gave up the Amorites to the Israelites , Joshua stood before all the people of Israel and said to the Lord : “ Sun , stand still over Gibeon . Moon , stand still over the Valley of Aijalon. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	13	So the sun stood still , and the moon stopped until the people defeated their enemies . These words are written in the Book of Jashar . The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and waited to go down for a full day .
NCV	Joshua	10	14	That has never happened at any time before that day or since . That was the day the Lord listened to a human being . Truly the Lord was fighting for Israel !
NCV	Joshua	10	15	After this , Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal .
NCV	Joshua	10	16	During the fight the five kings ran away and hid in a cave near Makkedah ,
NCV	Joshua	10	17	but someone found them hiding in the cave at Makkedah and told Joshua .
NCV	Joshua	10	18	So he said , “ Cover the opening of the cave with large rocks . Put some men there to guard it ,
NCV	Joshua	10	19	but don ’ t stay there yourselves . Continue chasing the enemy and attacking them from behind . Don ’ t let them get to their cities , because the Lord your God will hand them over to you. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	20	So Joshua and the Israelites killed the enemy , but a few were able to get back to their strong , walled cities .
NCV	Joshua	10	21	After the fighting , Joshua ’ s men came back safely to him at Makkedah . No one was brave enough to say a word against the Israelites .
NCV	Joshua	10	22	Joshua said , “ Move the rocks that are covering the opening of the cave and bring those five kings out to me. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	23	So Joshua ’ s men brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish , and Eglon .
NCV	Joshua	10	24	When they brought the five kings out to Joshua , he called for all his men . He said to the commanders of his army , “ Come here ! Put your feet on the necks of these kings. ” So they came close and put their feet on their necks .
NCV	Joshua	10	25	Joshua said to his men , “ Be strong and brave ! Don ’ t be afraid , because I will show you what the Lord will do to the enemies you will fight in the future. ”
NCV	Joshua	10	26	Then Joshua killed the five kings and hung their bodies on five trees , where he left them until evening .
NCV	Joshua	10	27	At sunset Joshua told his men to take the bodies down from the trees . Then they threw them into the same cave where they had been hiding and covered the opening of the cave with large rocks , which are still there today .
NCV	Joshua	10	28	That day Joshua defeated Makkedah . He killed the king and completely destroyed all the people in that city as an offering to the Lord ; no one was left alive . He did the same thing to the king of Makkedah that he had done to the king of Jericho . Defeating Southern Cities
NCV	Joshua	10	29	Joshua and all the Israelites traveled from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it .
NCV	Joshua	10	30	The Lord handed over the city and its king . They killed every person in the city ; no one was left alive . And they did the same thing to that king that they had done to the king of Jericho .
NCV	Joshua	10	31	Then Joshua and all the Israelites left Libnah and went to Lachish , which they surrounded and attacked .
NCV	Joshua	10	32	The Lord handed over Lachish on the second day . The Israelites killed everyone in that city just as they had done to Libnah .
NCV	Joshua	10	33	During this same time Horam king of Gezer came to help Lachish , but Joshua also defeated him and his army ; no one was left alive .
NCV	Joshua	10	34	Then Joshua and all the Israelites went from Lachish to Eglon . They surrounded Eglon , attacked it , and
NCV	Joshua	10	35	captured it the same day . They killed all its people and completely destroyed everything in it as an offering to the Lord , just as they had done to Lachish .
NCV	Joshua	10	36	Then Joshua and the Israelites went from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it ,
NCV	Joshua	10	37	capturing it and all the little towns near it . The Israelites killed everyone in Hebron ; no one was left alive there . Just as they had done to Eglon , they completely destroyed the city and all its people as an offering to the Lord .
NCV	Joshua	10	38	Then Joshua and the Israelites went back to Debir and attacked it .
NCV	Joshua	10	39	They captured that city , its king , and all the little towns near it , completely destroying everyone in Debir as an offering to the Lord ; no one was left alive there . Israel did to Debir and its king just as they had done to Libnah and its king , just as they had done to Hebron .
NCV	Joshua	10	40	So Joshua defeated all the kings of the cities of these areas : the mountains , southern Canaan , the western hills , and the slopes . The Lord , the God of Israel , had told Joshua to completely destroy all the people as an offering to the Lord , so he left no one alive in those places .
NCV	Joshua	10	41	Joshua captured all the cities from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza , and from Goshen to Gibeon .
NCV	Joshua	10	42	He captured all these cities and their kings on one trip , because the Lord , the God of Israel , was fighting for Israel .

NCV	Joshua	11	11	Israel killed everyone in Hazor , completely destroying them ; no one was left alive . Then they burned Hazor itself .
NCV	Joshua	11	2	He sent messages to the kings in the northern mountains and also to the kings in the Jordan Valley south of Lake Galilee and in the western hills . He sent a message to the king of Naphoth Dor in the west
NCV	Joshua	11	3	and to the kings of the Canaanites in the east and in the west . He sent messages to the Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , and Jebusites in the mountains . Jabin also sent one to the Hivites , who lived below Mount Hermon in the area of Mizpah .
NCV	Joshua	11	4	So the armies of all these kings came together with their horses and chariots . There were as many soldiers as grains of sand on the seashore .
NCV	Joshua	11	5	All of these kings met together at the waters of Merom , joined their armies together into one camp , and made plans to fight against the Israelites .
NCV	Joshua	11	6	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of them , because at this time tomorrow I will give them to you . You will cripple their horses and burn all their chariots. ”
NCV	Joshua	11	7	So Joshua and his whole army surprised the enemy by attacking them at the waters of Merom .
NCV	Joshua	11	8	The Lord handed them over to Israel . They chased them to Greater Sidon , Misrephoth Maim , and the Valley of Mizpah in the east . Israel fought until none of the enemy was left alive .
NCV	Joshua	11	9	Joshua did what the Lord said to do ; he crippled their horses and burned their chariots .
NCV	Joshua	11	10	Then Joshua went back and captured the city of Hazor and killed its king . ( Hazor had been the leader of all the kingdoms that fought against Israel . )
NCV	Joshua	11	12	Joshua captured all of these cities , killed all of their kings , and completely destroyed everything in these cities . He did this just as Moses , the servant of the Lord , had commanded .
NCV	Joshua	11	13	But the Israelites did not burn any cities that were built on their mounds , except Hazor ; only that city was burned by Joshua .
NCV	Joshua	11	14	The people of Israel kept for themselves everything they found in the cities , including all the animals . But they killed all the people there ; they left no one alive .
NCV	Joshua	11	15	Long ago the Lord had commanded his servant Moses to do this , and then Moses had commanded Joshua to do it . Joshua did everything the Lord had commanded Moses .
NCV	Joshua	11	16	So Joshua defeated all the people in the land . He had control of the mountains and the area of southern Canaan , all the areas of Goshen , the western hills , and the Jordan Valley . He controlled the mountains of Israel and all the hills near them .
NCV	Joshua	11	17	Joshua controlled all the land from Mount Halak near Edom to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon , below Mount Hermon . Joshua also captured all the kings in the land and killed them .
NCV	Joshua	11	18	He fought against them for many years .
NCV	Joshua	11	19	The people of only one city in all the land had made a peace agreement with Israel—the Hivites living in Gibeon . All the other cities were defeated in war .
NCV	Joshua	11	20	The Lord made those people stubborn so they would fight against Israel and he could completely destroy them without mercy . This is what the Lord had commanded Moses to do .
NCV	Joshua	11	21	Now Joshua fought the Anakites who lived in the mountains of Hebron , Debir , Anab , Judah , and Israel , and he completely destroyed them and their towns .
NCV	Joshua	11	22	There were no Anakites left living in the land of the Israelites and only a few were left in Gaza , Gath , and Ashdod .
NCV	Joshua	11	23	Joshua took control of all the land of Israel as the Lord had told Moses to do long ago . He gave the land to Israel , because he had promised it to them .

NCV	Joshua	13	13	Because the Israelites did not force out the people of Geshur and Maacah , they still live among the Israelites today .
NCV	Joshua	13	2	This is what is left : the regions of Geshur and of the Philistines ;

NCV	Joshua	13	8	East Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had received their land . The Lord ’ s servant Moses had given them the land east of the Jordan River .
NCV	Joshua	13	9	Their land started at Aroer at the Arnon Ravine and continued to the town in the middle of the ravine , and it included the whole plain from Medeba to Dibon .
NCV	Joshua	13	10	All the towns ruled by Sihon king of the Amorites , who ruled in the city of Heshbon , were in that land . The land continued to the area where the Ammonites lived .
NCV	Joshua	13	11	Gilead was also there , as well as the area where the people of Geshur and Maacah lived , and all of Mount Hermon and Bashan as far as Salecah .
NCV	Joshua	13	12	All the kingdom of Og king of Bashan was in the land . Og was one of the last of the Rephaites , and in the past he ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei . Moses had defeated them and had taken their land .
NCV	Joshua	13	14	The tribe of Levi was the only one that did not get any land . Instead , they were given all the burned sacrifices made to the Lord , the God of Israel , as he had promised them .
NCV	Joshua	13	15	Moses had given each family group from the tribe of Reuben some land :
NCV	Joshua	13	16	Theirs was the land from Aroer near the Arnon Ravine to the town of Medeba , including the whole plain and the town in the middle of the ravine ;

NCV	Joshua	13	22	The Israelites killed many people during the fighting , including Balaam of Beor , who tried to use magic to tell the future .
NCV	Joshua	13	23	The land given to Reuben stopped at the shore of the Jordan River . So the land given to the family groups of Reuben included all these towns and their villages that were listed .
NCV	Joshua	13	24	This is the land Moses gave to the tribe of Gad , to all its family groups :
NCV	Joshua	13	25	the land of Jazer and all the towns of Gilead ; half the land of the Ammonites that went as far as Aroer near Rabbah ;
NCV	Joshua	13	26	the area from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim ; the area from Mahanaim to the land of Debir ;

NCV	Joshua	14	14	Hebron still belongs to the family of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite because he had faith and obeyed the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	Joshua	14	2	The Lord had commanded Moses long ago how he wanted the people to choose their land . The people of the nine-and-a-half tribes threw lots to decide which land they would receive .
NCV	Joshua	14	3	Moses had already given the two-and-a-half tribes their land east of the Jordan River . But the tribe of Levi was not given any land like the others .
NCV	Joshua	14	4	The sons of Joseph had divided into two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim . The tribe of Levi was not given any land . It was given only some towns in which to live and pastures for its animals .
NCV	Joshua	14	5	The Lord had told Moses how to give the land to the tribes of Israel , and the Israelites divided the land . Caleb ’ s Land
NCV	Joshua	14	6	One day some men from the tribe of Judah went to Joshua at Gilgal . Among them was Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite . He said to Joshua , “ You remember what the Lord said at Kadesh Barnea when he was speaking to the prophet Moses about you and me .
NCV	Joshua	14	7	Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , sent me to look at the land where we were going . I was forty years old then . When I came back , I told Moses what I thought about the land .
NCV	Joshua	14	8	The other men who went with me frightened the people , but I fully believed the Lord would allow us to take the land .
NCV	Joshua	14	9	So that day Moses promised me , ‘ The land where you went will become your land , and your children will own it forever . I will give you that land because you fully believed in the Lord , my God. ’
NCV	Joshua	14	10	“ Now then , the Lord has kept his promise . He has kept me alive for forty-five years from the time he said this to Moses during the time we all wandered in the desert . Now here I am , eighty-five years old .
NCV	Joshua	14	11	I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out , and I am just as ready to fight now as I was then .
NCV	Joshua	14	12	So give me the mountain country the Lord promised me that day long ago . Back then you heard that the Anakite people lived there and the cities were large and well protected . But now with the Lord helping me , I will force them out , just as the Lord said. ”
NCV	Joshua	14	13	Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him the city of Hebron as his own .

NCV	Joshua	15	6	Then it went to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben .
NCV	Joshua	15	7	Then the northern border went through the Valley of Achor to Debir where it turned toward the north and went to Gilgal . Gilgal is across from the road that goes through Adummim Pass , on the south side of the ravine . The border continued to the waters of En Shemesh and stopped at En Rogel .
NCV	Joshua	15	8	Then it went through the Valley of Ben Hinnom , next to the southern side of the Jebusite city ( which is called Jerusalem ) . There the border went to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley , at the northern end of the Valley of Giants .

NCV	Joshua	15	11	to the hill north of Ekron . Then it turned toward Shikkeron and went past Mount Baalah and continued on to Jabneel , ending at the sea .
NCV	Joshua	15	12	The Mediterranean Sea was the western border . Inside these borders lived the family groups of Judah .
NCV	Joshua	15	13	The Lord had commanded Joshua to give Caleb son of Jephunneh part of the land in Judah , so he gave Caleb the town of Kiriath Arba , also called Hebron . ( Arba was the father of Anak . )
NCV	Joshua	15	14	Caleb forced out the three Anakite families living in Hebron : Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai , the descendants of Anak .
NCV	Joshua	15	16	Caleb said , “ I will give Acsah , my daughter , as a wife to the man who attacks and captures the city of Kiriath Sepher. ”
NCV	Joshua	15	17	Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s brother , captured the city , so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to Othniel to be his wife .
NCV	Joshua	15	18	When Acsah came to Othniel , she told him to ask her father for a field . So Acsah went to her father . When she got down from her donkey , Caleb asked her , “ What do you want ? ”
NCV	Joshua	15	19	Acsah answered , “ Do me a special favor . Since you have given me land in southern Canaan , also give me springs of water. ” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs .

NCV	Joshua	16	5	This is the land that was given to the family groups of Ephraim : Their border started at Ataroth Addar in the east , went to Upper Beth Horon ,

NCV	Joshua	17	17	Then Joshua said to the people of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh , “ There are many of you , and you have great power . You should be given more than one share of land .
NCV	Joshua	17	2	Land was also given to the other family groups of Manasseh—Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher , and Shemida . These were all the other sons of Manasseh son of Joseph .
NCV	Joshua	17	3	Zelophehad was the son of Hepher , who was the son of Gilead , who was the son of Makir , who was the son of Manasseh . Zelophehad had no sons , but he had five daughters , named Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
NCV	Joshua	17	4	They went to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua son of Nun and all the leaders . They said , “ The Lord told Moses to give us land like the men received. ” So Eleazar obeyed the Lord and gave the daughters some land , just like the brothers of their father .
NCV	Joshua	17	5	So the tribe of Manasseh had ten sections of land west of the Jordan River and two more sections , Gilead and Bashan , on the east side of the Jordan River .
NCV	Joshua	17	6	The daughters of Manasseh received land just as the sons did . Gilead was given to the rest of the families of Manasseh .
NCV	Joshua	17	7	The lands of Manasseh were in the area between Asher and Micmethath , near Shechem . The border went south to the En Tappuah area ,
NCV	Joshua	17	8	which belonged to Manasseh , except for the town of Tappuah . It was along the border of Manasseh ’ s land and belonged to the sons of Ephraim .
NCV	Joshua	17	9	The border of Manasseh continued south to Kanah Ravine . The cities in this area of Manasseh belonged to Ephraim . Manasseh ’ s border was on the north side of the ravine and went to the sea .
NCV	Joshua	17	10	The land to the south belonged to Ephraim , and the land to the north belonged to Manasseh . The Mediterranean Sea was the western border . The border touched Asher ’ s land on the north and Issachar ’ s land on the east .
NCV	Joshua	17	11	In the areas of Issachar and Asher , the people of Manasseh owned these towns : Beth Shan and its small towns ; Ibleam and its small towns ; the people who lived in Dor and its small towns ; the people in Naphoth Dor and its small towns ; the people who lived in Taanach and its small towns ; the people in Megiddo and its small towns .
NCV	Joshua	17	12	Manasseh was not able to defeat those cities , so the Canaanites continued to live there .
NCV	Joshua	17	13	When the Israelites grew strong , they forced the Canaanites to work for them , although they did not force them to leave the land .
NCV	Joshua	17	14	The people from the tribes of Joseph said to Joshua , “ You gave us only one area of land , but we are many people . Why did you give us only one part of all the land the Lord gave his people ? ”
NCV	Joshua	17	15	And Joshua answered them , “ If you have too many people , go up to the forest and make a place for yourselves to live there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaites . The mountain country of Ephraim is too small for you. ”
NCV	Joshua	17	16	The people of Joseph said , “ It is true . The mountain country of Ephraim is not enough for us , but the land where the Canaanites live is dangerous . They are skilled fighters . They have powerful weapons in Beth Shan and all the small towns in that area , and they are also in the Valley of Jezreel. ”
NCV	Joshua	17	18	You also will have the mountain country . It is a forest , but you can cut down the trees and make it a good place to live . You will own all of it because you will force the Canaanites to leave the land even though they have powerful weapons and are strong. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	18	18	The border continued to the northern part of Beth Arabah and went down into the Jordan Valley .
NCV	Joshua	18	2	But there were still seven tribes of Israel that had not yet received their land .
NCV	Joshua	18	3	So Joshua said to the Israelites : “ Why do you wait so long to take your land ? The Lord , the God of your ancestors , has given this land to you .
NCV	Joshua	18	4	Choose three men from each tribe , and I will send them out to study the land . They will describe in writing the land their tribe wants as its share , and then they will come back to me .
NCV	Joshua	18	5	They will divide the land into seven parts . The people of Judah will keep their land in the south , and the people of Joseph will keep their land in the north .
NCV	Joshua	18	6	You should describe the seven parts of land in writing and bring what you have written to me . Then I will throw lots in the presence of the Lord our God .
NCV	Joshua	18	7	But the Levites do not get any part of these lands , because they are priests , and their work is to serve the Lord . Gad , Reuben , and East Manasseh have received the land promised to them , which is east of the Jordan River . Moses , the servant of the Lord , gave it to them. ”
NCV	Joshua	18	8	So the men who were chosen to map the land started out . Joshua told them , “ Go and study the land and describe it in writing . Then come back to me , and I will throw lots in the presence of the Lord here in Shiloh. ”
NCV	Joshua	18	9	So the men left and went into the land . They described in a scroll each town in the seven parts of the land . Then they came back to Joshua , who was still at the camp at Shiloh .
NCV	Joshua	18	10	There Joshua threw lots in the presence of the Lord to choose the lands that should be given to each tribe . Land for Benjamin

NCV	Joshua	20	20	Then the Lord said to Joshua :
NCV	Joshua	20	2	“ Tell the Israelites to choose the special cities of safety , as I had Moses command you to do .
NCV	Joshua	20	3	If a person kills someone accidentally and without meaning to kill him , that person may go to a city of safety to hide . There the killer will be safe from the relative who has the duty of punishing a murderer .
NCV	Joshua	20	4	“ When the killer runs to one of those cities , he must stop at the entrance gate , stand there , and tell the leaders of the people what happened . Then that person will be allowed to enter the city and will be given a place to live among them .
NCV	Joshua	20	5	But if the one who is chasing him follows him to that city , the leaders of the city must not hand over the killer . It was an accident . He did not hate him beforehand or kill him on purpose .
NCV	Joshua	20	6	The killer must stay in the city until a court comes to a decision and until the high priest dies . Then he may go back home to the town from which he ran away. ”
NCV	Joshua	20	7	So the Israelites chose these cities to be cities of safety : Kedesh in Galilee in the mountains of Naphtali ; Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim ; Kiriath Arba ( also called Hebron ) in the mountains of Judah ;
NCV	Joshua	20	8	Bezer on the east side of the Jordan River near Jericho in the desert in the land of Reuben ; Ramoth in Gilead in the land of Gad ; and Golan in Bashan in the land of Manasseh .

NCV	Joshua	21	4	The Kohath family groups were part of the tribe of Levi . Some of the Levites in the Kohath family groups were from the family of Aaron the priest . To these Levites were given thirteen towns in the areas of Judah , Simeon , and Benjamin .

NCV	Joshua	21	12	But the fields and the villages around Kiriath Arba had been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh .

NCV	Joshua	22	22	“ The Lord is God of gods ! The Lord is God of gods ! God knows , and we want you to know also . If we have done something wrong , you may kill us .
NCV	Joshua	22	2	He said to them , “ You have done everything Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , told you to do . You have also obeyed all my commands .
NCV	Joshua	22	3	For a long time you have supported the other Israelites . You have been careful to obey the commands the Lord your God gave you .
NCV	Joshua	22	4	The Lord your God promised to give the Israelites peace , and he has kept his promise . Now you may go back to your homes , to the land that Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , gave you , on the east side of the Jordan River .
NCV	Joshua	22	5	But be careful to obey the teachings and laws Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , gave you : to love the Lord your God and obey his commands , to continue to follow him and serve him the very best you can. ”
NCV	Joshua	22	6	Then Joshua said good-bye to them , and they left and went away to their homes .
NCV	Joshua	22	7	Moses had given the land of Bashan to East Manasseh . Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan River to West Manasseh . And he sent them to their homes and he blessed them .
NCV	Joshua	22	8	He said , “ Go back to your homes and your riches . You have many animals , silver , gold , bronze , and iron , and many beautiful clothes . Also , you have taken many things from your enemies that you should divide among yourselves. ”
NCV	Joshua	22	9	So the people from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh left the other Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan and went back to Gilead . It was their own land , given to them by Moses as the Lord had commanded .
NCV	Joshua	22	10	The people of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh went to Geliloth , near the Jordan River in the land of Canaan . There they built a beautiful altar .
NCV	Joshua	22	11	The other Israelites still at Shiloh heard about the altar these three tribes built at the border of Canaan at Geliloth , near the Jordan River on Israel ’ s side .
NCV	Joshua	22	12	All the Israelites became very angry at these three tribes , so they met together and decided to fight them .
NCV	Joshua	22	13	The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to Gilead to talk to the people of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh .
NCV	Joshua	22	14	They also sent one leader from each of the ten tribes at Shiloh . Each of them was a leader of his family group of Israelites .
NCV	Joshua	22	15	These leaders went to Gilead to talk to the people of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh . They said :
NCV	Joshua	22	16	“ All the Israelites ask you : ‘ Why did you turn against the God of Israel by building an altar for yourselves ? You know that this is against God ’ s law .
NCV	Joshua	22	17	Remember what happened at Peor ? We still suffer today because of that sin , for which God made many Israelites very sick .
NCV	Joshua	22	18	And now are you turning against the Lord and refusing to follow him ? “ ‘ If you don ’ t stop what you ’ re doing today , the Lord will be angry with everyone in Israel tomorrow .
NCV	Joshua	22	19	If your land is unclean , come over into our land where the Lord ’ s Tent is . Share it with us . But don ’ t turn against the Lord and us by building another altar for the Lord our God .
NCV	Joshua	22	20	Remember how Achan son of Zerah refused to obey the command about what must be completely destroyed . That one man broke God ’ s law , but all the Israelites were punished . Achan died because of his sin , but others also died. ’ ”
NCV	Joshua	22	21	The people from Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh answered ,
NCV	Joshua	22	23	If we broke God ’ s law , we ask the Lord himself to punish us . We did not build this altar to offer burnt offerings or grain and fellowship offerings .
NCV	Joshua	22	24	“ We did not build it for that reason . We feared that someday your people would not accept us as part of your nation . Then they might say , ‘ You can not worship the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	Joshua	22	25	The Lord made the Jordan River a border between us and you people of Reuben and Gad . You can not worship the Lord. ’ So we feared that your children might make our children stop worshiping the Lord .
NCV	Joshua	22	26	“ That is why we decided to build this altar . But it is not for burnt offerings and sacrifices .
NCV	Joshua	22	27	This altar is proof to you and us and to all our children who will come after us that we worship the Lord with our whole burnt offerings , grain , and fellowship offerings . This was so your children would not say to our children , ‘ You are not the Lord ’ s. ’
NCV	Joshua	22	28	“ In the future if your children say that , our children can say , ‘ See the altar made by our ancestors . It is exactly like the Lord ’ s altar , but we do not use it for sacrifices . It shows that we are part of Israel. ’
NCV	Joshua	22	29	“ Truly , we don ’ t want to be against the Lord or to stop following him by building an altar for burnt offerings , grain offerings , or sacrifices . We know the only true altar to the Lord our God is in front of the Holy Tent. ”
NCV	Joshua	22	30	When Phinehas the priest and the ten leaders heard the people of Reuben , Gad , and East Manasseh , they were pleased .

NCV	Joshua	23	23	The Lord gave Israel peace from their enemies around them . Many years passed , and Joshua grew very old .
NCV	Joshua	23	2	He called a meeting of all the elders , heads of families , judges , and officers of Israel . He said , “ I am now very old .
NCV	Joshua	23	3	You have seen what the Lord has done to our enemies to help us . The Lord your God fought for you .
NCV	Joshua	23	4	Remember that your people have been given their land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea in the west , the land I promised to give you .
NCV	Joshua	23	5	The Lord your God will force out the people living there . The Lord will push them out ahead of you . And you will own the land , as he has promised you .
NCV	Joshua	23	6	“ Be strong . You must be careful to obey everything commanded in the Book of the Teachings of Moses . Do not stray from it either from the left or the right .
NCV	Joshua	23	7	Don ’ t become friends with the people living among us who are not Israelites . Don ’ t say the names of their gods or make anyone swear by them . Don ’ t serve or worship them .
NCV	Joshua	23	8	You must continue to follow the Lord your God , as you have done in the past .
NCV	Joshua	23	9	“ The Lord has forced many great and powerful nations to leave ahead of you . No nation has been able to defeat you .
NCV	Joshua	23	10	With his help , one Israelite could defeat a thousand , because the Lord your God fights for you , as he promised to do .
NCV	Joshua	23	11	So you must be careful to love the Lord your God .
NCV	Joshua	23	12	“ If you turn away from the way of the Lord and become friends with these people who are not part of Israel and marry them ,
NCV	Joshua	23	13	the Lord your God will not help you defeat your enemies . They will be like traps for you , like whips on your back and thorns in your eyes , and none of you will be left in this good land the Lord your God has given you .
NCV	Joshua	23	14	“ It ’ s almost time for me to die . You know and fully believe that the Lord has done great things for you . You know that he has not failed to keep any of his promises .
NCV	Joshua	23	15	Every good promise that the Lord your God made has come true , and in the same way , his other promises will come true . He promised that evil will come to you and that he will destroy you from this good land that he gave you .
NCV	Joshua	23	16	This will happen if you don ’ t keep your agreement with the Lord your God . If you go and serve other gods and worship them , the Lord will become very angry with you . Then none of you will be left in this good land he has given you. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Joshua	24	24	Then the people said to Joshua , “ We will serve the Lord our God , and we will obey him. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	2	Then Joshua said to all the people , “ Here ’ s what the Lord , the God of Israel , says to you : ‘ A long time ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River . Terah , the father of Abraham and Nahor , worshiped other gods .
NCV	Joshua	24	3	But I , the Lord , took your ancestor Abraham from the other side of the river and led him through the land of Canaan . And I gave him many children , including his son Isaac .
NCV	Joshua	24	4	I gave Isaac two sons named Jacob and Esau . I gave the land around the mountains of Edom to Esau , but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt .
NCV	Joshua	24	5	Then I sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt , where I brought many disasters on the Egyptians . Afterwards I brought you out .
NCV	Joshua	24	6	When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , they came to the Red Sea , and the Egyptians chased them with chariots and men on horses .
NCV	Joshua	24	7	So the people called out to the Lord . And I brought darkness between you and the Egyptians and made the sea to cover them . You yourselves saw what I did to the army of Egypt . After that , you lived in the desert for a long time .
NCV	Joshua	24	8	“ ‘ Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites , east of the Jordan River . They fought against you , but I handed them over to you . I destroyed them before you , and you took control of that land .
NCV	Joshua	24	9	But the king of Moab , Balak son of Zippor , prepared to fight against the Israelites . The king sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you ,
NCV	Joshua	24	10	but I refused to listen to Balaam . So he asked for good things to happen to you ! I saved you and brought you out of his power .
NCV	Joshua	24	11	“ ‘ Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho , where the people of Jericho fought against you . Also , the Amorites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hittites , Girgashites , Hivites , and Jebusites fought against you . But I handed them over to you .
NCV	Joshua	24	12	I sent terror ahead of you to force out two Amorite kings . You took the land without using swords and bows .
NCV	Joshua	24	13	I gave you that land where you did not have to work . I gave you cities that you did not have to build . And now you live in that land and in those cities , and you eat from vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant. ’ ”
NCV	Joshua	24	14	Then Joshua said to the people , “ Now respect the Lord and serve him fully and sincerely . Throw away the gods that your ancestors worshiped on the other side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt . Serve the Lord .
NCV	Joshua	24	15	But if you don ’ t want to serve the Lord , you must choose for yourselves today whom you will serve . You may serve the gods that your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River , or you may serve the gods of the Amorites who lived in this land . As for me and my family , we will serve the Lord. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	16	Then the people answered , “ We will never stop following the Lord to serve other gods !
NCV	Joshua	24	17	It was the Lord our God who brought our ancestors out of Egypt . We were slaves in that land , but the Lord did great things for us there . He brought us out and protected us while we traveled through other lands .
NCV	Joshua	24	18	Then he forced out all the people living in these lands , even the Amorites . So we will serve the Lord , because he is our God. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	19	Then Joshua said , “ You are not able to serve the Lord , because he is a holy God and a jealous God . If you turn against him and sin , he will not forgive you .
NCV	Joshua	24	20	If you leave the Lord and serve other gods , he will send you great trouble . The Lord may have been good to you , but if you turn against him , he will destroy you. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	21	But the people said to Joshua , “ No ! We will serve the Lord. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	22	Then Joshua said , “ You are your own witnesses that you have chosen to serve the Lord. ” The people said , “ Yes , we are. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	23	Then Joshua said , “ Now throw away the gods that you have . Love the Lord , the God of Israel , with all your heart. ”
NCV	Joshua	24	25	On that day at Shechem Joshua made an agreement for the people . He made rules and laws for them to follow .
NCV	Joshua	24	26	Joshua wrote these things in the Book of the Teachings of God . Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree near the Lord ’ s Holy Tent .
NCV	Joshua	24	27	Joshua said to all the people , “ See this stone ! It will remind you of what we did today . It was here the Lord spoke to us today . It will remind you of what happened so you will not turn against your God. ” Joshua Dies
NCV	Joshua	24	28	Then Joshua sent the people back to their land .

NCV	Judges	1	1	After Joshua died , the Israelites asked the Lord , “ Who will be first to go and fight for us against the Canaanites ? ”
NCV	Judges	1	2	The Lord said to them , “ The tribe of Judah will go . I have handed the land over to them. ”
NCV	Judges	1	3	The men of Judah said to the men of Simeon , their relatives , “ Come and help us fight the Canaanites for our land . If you do , we will go and help you fight for your land. ” So the men of Simeon went with them .
NCV	Judges	1	4	When Judah attacked , the Lord handed over the Canaanites and the Perizzites to them , and they defeated ten thousand men at the city of Bezek .
NCV	Judges	1	5	There they found Adoni-Bezek , the ruler of the city , and fought him . The men of Judah defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites ,
NCV	Judges	1	6	but Adoni-Bezek ran away . The men of Judah chased him , and when they caught him , they cut off his thumbs and big toes .
NCV	Judges	1	7	Adoni-Bezek said , “ Seventy kings whose thumbs and big toes had been cut off used to eat scraps that fell from my table . Now God has paid me back for what I did to them. ” The men of Judah took Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem , and he died there .
NCV	Judges	1	8	Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it . They attacked with their swords and burned the city .
NCV	Judges	1	9	Later , they went down to fight the Canaanites who lived in the mountains , in the dry country to the south , and in the western hills .
NCV	Judges	1	10	The men of Judah went to fight against the Canaanites in the city of Hebron ( which used to be called Kiriath Arba ) . And they defeated Sheshai , Ahiman , and Talmai . Caleb and His Daughter

NCV	Judges	1	13	Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother , captured the city , so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to Othniel to be his wife .
NCV	Judges	1	14	When Acsah came to Othniel , she told him to ask her father for a field . When she got down from her donkey , Caleb asked her , “ What do you want ? ”
NCV	Judges	1	15	Acsah answered him , “ Do me a special favor . Since you have given me land in southern Canaan , also give me springs of water. ” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs . Fights with the Canaanites
NCV	Judges	1	16	The Kenite people , who were from the family of Moses ’ father-in-law , left Jericho , the city of palm trees . They went with the men of Judah to the Desert of Judah to live with them there in southern Judah near the city of Arad .

NCV	Judges	1	18	The men of Judah captured Gaza , Ashkelon , Ekron , and the lands around them .
NCV	Judges	1	19	The Lord was with the men of Judah . They took the land in the mountains , but they could not force out the people living on the plain , because they had iron chariots .
NCV	Judges	1	20	As Moses had promised , Hebron was given to Caleb , and Caleb forced out the three sons of Anak .

NCV	Judges	1	22	The men of Joseph went to fight against the city of Bethel , and the Lord was with them .
NCV	Judges	1	23	They sent some spies to Bethel ( which used to be called Luz ) .
NCV	Judges	1	24	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and said to him , “ Show us a way into the city , and we will be kind to you. ”
NCV	Judges	1	25	So the man showed them the way into the city . The men of Joseph attacked with swords the people in Bethel , but they let the man and his family go free .
NCV	Judges	1	26	He went to the land where the Hittites lived and built a city . He named it Luz , which it is called even today .
NCV	Judges	1	27	There were Canaanites living in the cities of Beth Shan , Taanach , Dor , Ibleam , Megiddo , and the small towns around them . The people of Manasseh did not force those people out of their towns , because the Canaanites were determined to stay there .
NCV	Judges	1	28	Later , the Israelites grew strong and forced the Canaanites to work as slaves , but they did not make all the Canaanites leave their land .
NCV	Judges	1	29	The people of Ephraim did not force out all of the Canaanites living in Gezer . So the Canaanites continued to live in Gezer with the people of Ephraim .
NCV	Judges	1	30	The people of Zebulun did not force out the Canaanites living in the cities of Kitron and Nahalol . They stayed and lived with the people of Zebulun , but Zebulun made them work as slaves .
NCV	Judges	1	31	The people of Asher did not force the Canaanites from the cities of Acco , Sidon , Ahlab , Aczib , Helbah , Aphek , and Rehob .

NCV	Judges	1	33	The people of Naphtali did not force out the people of the cities of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath . So they continued to live with the Canaanites in those cities , and the Canaanites worked as slaves .
NCV	Judges	1	34	The Amorites forced the Danites back into the mountains and would not let them come down to live in the plain .

NCV	Judges	2	2	But you must not make an agreement with the people who live in this land . You must destroy their altars. ’ But you did not obey me . How could you do this ?

NCV	Judges	2	10	After those people had died , their children grew up and did not know the Lord or what he had done for Israel .
NCV	Judges	2	11	So they did what the Lord said was wrong , and they worshiped the Baal idols .
NCV	Judges	2	12	They quit following the Lord , the God of their ancestors who had brought them out of Egypt . They began to worship the gods of the people who lived around them , and that made the Lord angry .
NCV	Judges	2	13	The Israelites quit following the Lord and worshiped Baal and Ashtoreth .
NCV	Judges	2	14	The Lord was angry with the people of Israel , so he handed them over to robbers who took their possessions . He let their enemies who lived around them defeat them ; they could not protect themselves .
NCV	Judges	2	15	When the Israelites went out to fight , they always lost , because the Lord was not with them . The Lord had sworn to them this would happen . So the Israelites suffered very much . God Chooses Judges
NCV	Judges	2	16	Then the Lord chose leaders called judges , [ b ] who saved the Israelites from the robbers .
NCV	Judges	2	17	But the Israelites did not listen to their judges . They were not faithful to God but worshiped other gods instead . Their ancestors had obeyed the Lord ’ s commands , but they quickly turned away and did not obey .
NCV	Judges	2	18	When their enemies hurt them , the Israelites cried for help . So the Lord felt sorry for them and sent judges to save them from their enemies . The Lord was with those judges all their lives .
NCV	Judges	2	19	But when the judges died , the Israelites again sinned and worshiped other gods . They became worse than their ancestors . The Israelites were very stubborn and refused to change their evil ways .
NCV	Judges	2	20	So the Lord became angry with the Israelites . He said , “ These people have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors . They have not listened to me .
NCV	Judges	2	21	I will no longer defeat the nations who were left when Joshua died .
NCV	Judges	2	22	I will use them to test Israel , to see if Israel will keep the Lord ’ s commands as their ancestors did. ”

NCV	Judges	3	3	These are the nations : the five rulers of the Philistines , all the Canaanites , the people of Sidon , and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath .
NCV	Judges	3	2	( The only reason the Lord left those nations in the land was to teach the descendants of the Israelites who had not fought in those wars how to fight . )
NCV	Judges	3	4	Those nations were in the land to test the Israelites—to see if they would obey the commands the Lord had given to their ancestors by Moses .
NCV	Judges	3	5	The people of Israel lived with the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
NCV	Judges	3	6	The Israelites began to marry the daughters of those people , and they allowed their daughters to marry the sons of those people . Israel also served their gods . Othniel , the First Judge
NCV	Judges	3	7	The Israelites did what the Lord said was wrong . They forgot about the Lord their God and served the idols of Baal and Asherah .
NCV	Judges	3	8	So the Lord was angry with Israel and allowed Cushan-Rishathaim king of Northwest Mesopotamia to rule over the Israelites for eight years .
NCV	Judges	3	9	When Israel cried to the Lord , the Lord sent someone to save them . Othniel son of Kenaz , Caleb ’ s younger brother , saved the Israelites .
NCV	Judges	3	10	The Spirit of the Lord entered Othniel , and he became Israel ’ s judge . When he went to war , the Lord handed over to him Cushan-Rishathaim king of Northwest Mesopotamia .
NCV	Judges	3	11	So the land was at peace for forty years . Then Othniel son of Kenaz died . Ehud , the Judge
NCV	Judges	3	12	Again the people of Israel did what the Lord said was wrong . So the Lord gave Eglon king of Moab power to defeat Israel because of the evil Israel did .
NCV	Judges	3	13	Eglon got the Ammonites and the Amalekites to join him . Then he attacked Israel and took Jericho , the city of palm trees .
NCV	Judges	3	14	So the people of Israel were ruled by Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years .
NCV	Judges	3	15	When the people cried to the Lord , he sent someone to save them . He was Ehud , son of Gera from the people of Benjamin , who was left-handed . Israel sent Ehud to give Eglon king of Moab the payment he demanded .
NCV	Judges	3	16	Ehud made himself a sword with two edges , about eighteen inches long , and he tied it to his right hip under his clothes .
NCV	Judges	3	17	Ehud gave Eglon king of Moab the payment he demanded . Now Eglon was a very fat man .
NCV	Judges	3	18	After he had given Eglon the payment , Ehud sent away the people who had carried it .
NCV	Judges	3	19	When he passed the statues near Gilgal , he turned around and said to Eglon , “ I have a secret message for you , King Eglon. ” The king said , “ Be quiet ! ” Then he sent all of his servants out of the room .
NCV	Judges	3	20	Ehud went to King Eglon , as he was sitting alone in the room above his summer palace . Ehud said , “ I have a message from God for you. ” As the king stood up from his chair ,
NCV	Judges	3	21	Ehud reached with his left hand and took out the sword that was tied to his right hip . Then he stabbed the sword deep into the king ’ s belly !
NCV	Judges	3	22	Even the handle sank in , and the blade came out his back . The king ’ s fat covered the whole sword , so Ehud left the sword in Eglon .
NCV	Judges	3	23	Then he went out of the room and closed and locked the doors behind him .
NCV	Judges	3	24	When the servants returned just after Ehud left , they found the doors to the room locked . So they thought the king was relieving himself .
NCV	Judges	3	25	They waited for a long time . Finally they became worried because he still had not opened the doors . So they got the key and unlocked them and saw their king lying dead on the floor !
NCV	Judges	3	26	While the servants were waiting , Ehud had escaped . He passed by the statues and went to Seirah .
NCV	Judges	3	27	When he reached the mountains of Ephraim he blew the trumpet . The people of Israel heard it and went down from the hills with Ehud leading them .
NCV	Judges	3	28	He said to them , “ Follow me ! The Lord has helped you to defeat your enemies , the Moabites. ” So Israel followed Ehud and captured the crossings of the Jordan River . They did not allow the Moabites to cross the Jordan River .
NCV	Judges	3	29	Israel killed about ten thousand strong and able men from Moab ; not one escaped .
NCV	Judges	3	30	So that day Moab was forced to be under the rule of Israel , and there was peace in the land for eighty years . Shamgar , the Judge

NCV	Judges	4	4	A prophetess named Deborah , the wife of Lappidoth , was judge of Israel at that time .
NCV	Judges	4	2	So he let Jabin , a king of Canaan who ruled in the city of Hazor , defeat Israel . Sisera , who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim , was the commander of Jabin ’ s army .
NCV	Judges	4	3	Because he had nine hundred iron chariots and was very cruel to the people of Israel for twenty years , they cried to the Lord for help .
NCV	Judges	4	5	Deborah would sit under the Palm Tree of Deborah , which was between the cities of Ramah and Bethel , in the mountains of Ephraim . And the people of Israel would come to her to settle their arguments .
NCV	Judges	4	6	Deborah sent a message to Barak son of Abinoam . Barak lived in the city of Kedesh , which is in the area of Naphtali . Deborah said to Barak , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , commands you : ‘ Go and gather ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them to Mount Tabor .
NCV	Judges	4	7	I will make Sisera , the commander of Jabin ’ s army , and his chariots , and his army meet you at the Kishon River . I will hand Sisera over to you. ’ ”
NCV	Judges	4	8	Then Barak said to Deborah , “ I will go if you will go with me , but if you won ’ t go with me , I won ’ t go. ”
NCV	Judges	4	9	“ Of course I will go with you , ” Deborah answered , “ but you will not get credit for the victory . The Lord will let a woman defeat Sisera. ” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh .
NCV	Judges	4	10	At Kedesh , Barak called the people of Zebulun and Naphtali together . From them , he gathered ten thousand men to follow him , and Deborah went with him also .
NCV	Judges	4	11	Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites , the descendants of Hobab , Moses ’ brother-in-law . Heber had put up his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim , near Kedesh .
NCV	Judges	4	12	When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone to Mount Tabor ,
NCV	Judges	4	13	Sisera gathered his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him , from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River .
NCV	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , “ Get up ! Today is the day the Lord will hand over Sisera . The Lord has already cleared the way for you. ” So Barak led ten thousand men down Mount Tabor .
NCV	Judges	4	15	As Barak approached , the Lord confused Sisera and his army and chariots . The Lord defeated them with the sword , but Sisera left his chariot and ran away on foot .
NCV	Judges	4	16	Barak and his men chased Sisera ’ s chariots and army to Harosheth Haggoyim . With their swords they killed all of Sisera ’ s men ; not one of them was left alive .
NCV	Judges	4	17	But Sisera himself ran away to the tent where Jael lived . She was the wife of Heber , one of the Kenite family groups . Heber ’ s family was at peace with Jabin king of Hazor .
NCV	Judges	4	18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him , “ Come into my tent , master ! Come in . Don ’ t be afraid. ” So Sisera went into Jael ’ s tent , and she covered him with a rug .
NCV	Judges	4	19	Sisera said to Jael , “ I am thirsty . Please give me some water to drink. ” So she opened a leather bag of milk and gave him a drink . Then she covered him up .
NCV	Judges	4	20	He said to her , “ Go stand at the entrance to the tent . If anyone comes and asks you , ‘ Is anyone here ? ’ say , ‘ No. ’ ”
NCV	Judges	4	21	But Jael , the wife of Heber , took a tent peg and a hammer and quietly went to Sisera . Since he was very tired , he was in a deep sleep . She hammered the tent peg through the side of Sisera ’ s head and into the ground . And so Sisera died .
NCV	Judges	4	22	At that very moment Barak came by Jael ’ s tent , chasing Sisera . Jael went out to meet him and said , “ Come . I will show you the man you are looking for. ” So Barak entered her tent , and there Sisera lay dead , with the tent peg in his head .
NCV	Judges	4	23	On that day God defeated Jabin king of Canaan in the sight of Israel .

NCV	Judges	5	8	At that time they chose to follow new gods . Because of this , enemies fought us at our city gates . No one could find a shield or a spear among the forty thousand people of Israel .

NCV	Judges	5	14	They came from Ephraim in the mountains of Amalek . Benjamin was among the people who followed you . From the family group of Makir , the commanders came down . And from Zebulun came those who lead .
NCV	Judges	5	15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah . The people of Issachar were loyal to Barak and followed him into the valley . The Reubenites thought hard about what they would do .
NCV	Judges	5	16	Why did you stay by the sheepfold ? Was it to hear the music played for your sheep ? The Reubenites thought hard about what they would do .
NCV	Judges	5	17	The people of Gilead stayed east of the Jordan River . People of Dan , why did you stay by the ships ? The people of Asher stayed at the seashore , at their safe harbors .
NCV	Judges	5	18	But the people of Zebulun risked their lives , as did the people of Naphtali on the battlefield .
NCV	Judges	5	19	“ The kings came , and they fought . At that time the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach , by the waters of Megiddo . But they took away no silver or possessions of Israel .
NCV	Judges	5	20	The stars fought from heaven ; from their paths , they fought Sisera .
NCV	Judges	5	21	The Kishon River swept Sisera ’ s men away , that old river , the Kishon River . March on , my soul , with strength !

NCV	Judges	6	6	Israel became very poor because of the Midianites , so they cried out to the Lord .
NCV	Judges	6	2	Because the Midianites were very powerful and were cruel to Israel , the Israelites made hiding places in the mountains , in caves , and in safe places .
NCV	Judges	6	3	Whenever the Israelites planted crops , the Midianites , Amalekites , and other peoples from the east would come and attack them .
NCV	Judges	6	4	They camped in the land and destroyed the crops that the Israelites had planted as far away as Gaza . They left nothing for Israel to eat , and no sheep , cattle , or donkeys .
NCV	Judges	6	5	The Midianites came with their tents and their animals like swarms of locusts to ruin the land . There were so many people and camels they could not be counted .
NCV	Judges	6	7	When the Israelites cried out to the Lord against the Midianites ,
NCV	Judges	6	8	the Lord sent a prophet to them . He said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I brought you out of Egypt , the land of slavery .
NCV	Judges	6	9	I saved you from the Egyptians and from all those who were against you . I forced the Canaanites out of their land and gave it to you .
NCV	Judges	6	10	Then I said to you , ‘ I am the Lord your God . Live in the land of the Amorites , but do not worship their gods. ’ But you did not obey me. ” The Angel of the Lord Visits Gideon
NCV	Judges	6	11	The angel of the Lord came and sat down under the oak tree at Ophrah that belonged to Joash , one of the Abiezrite people . Gideon , Joash ’ s son , was separating some wheat from the chaff in a winepress to keep the wheat from the Midianites .
NCV	Judges	6	12	The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon and said , “ The Lord is with you , mighty warrior ! ”
NCV	Judges	6	13	Then Gideon said , “ Sir , if the Lord is with us , why are we having so much trouble ? Where are the miracles our ancestors told us he did when the Lord brought them out of Egypt ? But now he has left us and has handed us over to the Midianites. ”
NCV	Judges	6	14	The Lord turned to Gideon and said , “ Go with your strength and save Israel from the Midianites . I am the one who is sending you. ”
NCV	Judges	6	15	But Gideon answered , “ Lord , how can I save Israel ? My family group is the weakest in Manasseh , and I am the least important member of my family. ”
NCV	Judges	6	16	The Lord answered him , “ I will be with you . It will seem as if the Midianites you are fighting are only one man. ”
NCV	Judges	6	17	Then Gideon said to the Lord , “ If you are pleased with me , give me proof that it is really you talking with me .
NCV	Judges	6	18	Please wait here until I come back to you . Let me bring my offering and set it in front of you. ” And the Lord said , “ I will wait until you return. ”
NCV	Judges	6	19	So Gideon went in and cooked a young goat , and with twenty quarts of flour , made bread without yeast . Then he put the meat into a basket and the broth into a pot . He brought them out and gave them to the angel under the oak tree .
NCV	Judges	6	20	The angel of God said to Gideon , “ Put the meat and the bread without yeast on that rock over there . Then pour the broth on them. ” And Gideon did as he was told .
NCV	Judges	6	21	The angel of the Lord touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick that was in his hand . Then fire jumped up from the rock and completely burned up the meat and the bread ! And the angel of the Lord disappeared !
NCV	Judges	6	22	Then Gideon understood he had been talking to the angel of the Lord . So Gideon cried out , “ Lord God ! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face ! ”
NCV	Judges	6	23	But the Lord said to Gideon , “ Calm down ! Don ’ t be afraid ! You will not die ! ”
NCV	Judges	6	24	So Gideon built an altar there to worship the Lord and named it The Lord Is Peace . It still stands at Ophrah , where the Abiezrites live . Gideon Tears Down the Altar of Baal
NCV	Judges	6	25	That same night the Lord said to Gideon , “ Take the bull that belongs to your father and a second bull seven years old . Pull down your father ’ s altar to Baal , and cut down the Asherah idol beside it .
NCV	Judges	6	26	Then build an altar to the Lord your God with its stones in the right order on this high ground . Kill and burn a second bull on this altar , using the wood from the Asherah idol. ”
NCV	Judges	6	27	So Gideon got ten of his servants and did what the Lord had told him to do . But Gideon was afraid that his family and the men of the city might see him , so he did it at night , not in the daytime .
NCV	Judges	6	28	When the men of the city got up the next morning , they saw that the altar for Baal had been destroyed and that the Asherah idol beside it had been cut down ! They also saw the altar Gideon had built and the second bull that had been sacrificed on it .
NCV	Judges	6	29	The men of the city asked each other , “ Who did this ? ” After they asked many questions , someone told them , “ Gideon son of Joash did this. ”
NCV	Judges	6	30	So they said to Joash , “ Bring your son out . He has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah idol beside it . He must die ! ”
NCV	Judges	6	31	But Joash said to the angry crowd around him , “ Are you going to take Baal ’ s side ? Are you going to defend him ? Anyone who takes Baal ’ s side will be killed by morning ! If Baal is a god , let him fight for himself . It ’ s his altar that has been pulled down. ”
NCV	Judges	6	32	So on that day Gideon got the name Jerub-Baal , which means “ let Baal fight against him , ” because Gideon pulled down Baal ’ s altar . Gideon Defeats Midian
NCV	Judges	6	33	All the Midianites , the Amalekites , and other peoples from the east joined together and came across the Jordan River and camped in the Valley of Jezreel .
NCV	Judges	6	34	But the Spirit of the Lord entered Gideon , and he blew a trumpet to call the Abiezrites to follow him .
NCV	Judges	6	35	He sent messengers to all of Manasseh , calling them to follow him . He also sent messengers to the people of Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali . So they also went up to meet Gideon and his men .
NCV	Judges	6	36	Then Gideon said to God , “ You said you would help me save Israel .
NCV	Judges	6	37	I will put some wool on the threshing floor . If there is dew only on the wool but all of the ground is dry , then I will know that you will use me to save Israel , as you said. ”
NCV	Judges	6	38	And that is just what happened . When Gideon got up early the next morning and squeezed the wool , he got a full bowl of water from it .
NCV	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , “ Don ’ t be angry with me if I ask just one more thing . Please let me make one more test . Let only the wool be dry while the ground around it gets wet with dew. ”
NCV	Judges	6	40	That night God did that very thing . Just the wool was dry , but the ground around it was wet with dew . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Judges	7	7	Then the Lord said to Gideon , “ Using the three hundred men who lapped the water , I will save you and hand Midian over to you . Let all the others go home. ”
NCV	Judges	7	2	Then the Lord said to Gideon , “ You have too many men to defeat the Midianites . I don ’ t want the Israelites to brag that they saved themselves .
NCV	Judges	7	3	So now , announce to the people , ‘ Anyone who is afraid may leave Mount Gilead and go back home. ’ ” So twenty-two thousand men returned home , but ten thousand remained .
NCV	Judges	7	4	Then the Lord said to Gideon , “ There are still too many men . Take the men down to the water , and I will test them for you there . If I say , ‘ This man will go with you , he will go . But if I say , ‘ That one will not go with you , ’ he will not go. ”
NCV	Judges	7	5	So Gideon led the men down to the water . There the Lord said to him , “ Separate them into those who drink water by lapping it up like a dog and those who bend down to drink. ”
NCV	Judges	7	6	There were three hundred men who used their hands to bring water to their mouths , lapping it as a dog does . All the rest got down on their knees to drink .
NCV	Judges	7	8	So Gideon sent the rest of Israel to their homes . But he kept three hundred men and took the jars and the trumpets of those who left . Now the camp of Midian was in the valley below Gideon .
NCV	Judges	7	9	That night the Lord said to Gideon , “ Get up . Go down and attack the camp of the Midianites , because I will give them to you .
NCV	Judges	7	10	But if you are afraid to go down , take your servant Purah with you .
NCV	Judges	7	11	When you come to the camp of Midian , you will hear what they are saying . Then you will not be afraid to attack the camp. ” Gideon Is Encouraged So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp .
NCV	Judges	7	12	The Midianites , the Amalekites , and all the peoples from the east were camped in that valley . There were so many of them they seemed like locusts . Their camels could not be counted because they were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore !
NCV	Judges	7	13	When Gideon came to the enemy camp , he heard a man telling his friend about a dream . He was saying , “ I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into the camp of Midian . It hit the tent so hard that the tent turned over and fell flat ! ”
NCV	Judges	7	14	The man ’ s friend said , “ Your dream is about the sword of Gideon son of Joash , a man of Israel . God will hand Midian and the whole army over to him ! ”
NCV	Judges	7	15	When Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant , he worshiped God . Then Gideon went back to the camp of Israel and called out to them , “ Get up ! The Lord has handed the army of Midian over to you ! ”
NCV	Judges	7	16	Gideon divided the three hundred men into three groups . He gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a burning torch inside .
NCV	Judges	7	17	Gideon told the men , “ Watch me and do what I do . When I get to the edge of the camp , do what I do .
NCV	Judges	7	18	Surround the enemy camp . When I and everyone with me blow our trumpets , you blow your trumpets , too . Then shout , ‘ For the Lord and for Gideon ! ’ ” Midian Is Defeated
NCV	Judges	7	19	So Gideon and the one hundred men with him came to the edge of the enemy camp just after they had changed guards . It was during the middle watch of the night . Then Gideon and his men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars .
NCV	Judges	7	20	All three groups of Gideon ’ s men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars . They held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands . Then they shouted , “ A sword for the Lord and for Gideon ! ”
NCV	Judges	7	21	Each of Gideon ’ s men stayed in his place around the camp , but the Midianites began shouting and running to escape .
NCV	Judges	7	22	When Gideon ’ s three hundred men blew their trumpets , the Lord made all the Midianites fight each other with their swords ! The enemy army ran away to the city of Beth Shittah toward Zererah . They ran as far as the border of Abel Meholah , near the city of Tabbath .
NCV	Judges	7	23	Then men of Israel from Naphtali , Asher , and all of Manasseh were called out to chase the Midianites .
NCV	Judges	7	24	Gideon sent messengers through all the mountains of Ephraim , saying , “ Come down and attack the Midianites . Take control of the Jordan River as far as Beth Barah before the Midianites can get to it. ” So they called out all the men of Ephraim , who took control of the Jordan River as far as Beth Barah .
NCV	Judges	7	25	The men of Ephraim captured two princes of Midian named Oreb and Zeeb . They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb , and they continued chasing the Midianites . They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon , who was east of the Jordan River . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Judges	8	8	Gideon left Succoth and went to the city of Peniel and asked them for food . But the people of Peniel gave him the same answer as the people of Succoth .
NCV	Judges	8	2	But he answered them , “ I have not done as well as you ! The small part you did was better than all that my people of Abiezer did .
NCV	Judges	8	3	God let you capture Oreb and Zeeb , the princes of Midian . How can I compare what I did with what you did ? ” When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon ’ s answer , they were not as angry anymore . Gideon Captures Two Kings
NCV	Judges	8	4	When Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan River , they were tired , but they chased the enemy across to the other side .
NCV	Judges	8	5	Gideon said to the men of Succoth , “ Please give my soldiers some bread because they are very tired . I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian. ”
NCV	Judges	8	6	But the leaders of Succoth said , “ Why should we give your soldiers bread ? You haven ’ t caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet. ”
NCV	Judges	8	7	Then Gideon said , “ The Lord will surrender Zebah and Zalmunna to me . After that , I will whip your skin with thorns and briers from the desert. ”
NCV	Judges	8	9	So Gideon said to the men of Peniel , “ After I win the victory , I will return and pull down this tower. ”
NCV	Judges	8	10	Zebah and Zalmunna and their army were in the city of Karkor . About fifteen thousand men were left of the armies of the peoples of the east . Already one hundred twenty thousand soldiers had been killed .
NCV	Judges	8	11	Gideon went up the road of those who live in tents east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and he attacked the enemy army when they did not expect it .
NCV	Judges	8	12	Zebah and Zalmunna , the kings of Midian , ran away , but Gideon chased and captured them and frightened away their army .
NCV	Judges	8	13	Then Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres .
NCV	Judges	8	14	Gideon captured a young man from Succoth and asked him some questions . So the young man wrote down for Gideon the names of seventy-seven officers and elders of Succoth . Gideon Punishes Succoth

NCV	Judges	8	16	So Gideon took the elders of the city and punished them with thorns and briers from the desert .
NCV	Judges	8	17	He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the people in that city .
NCV	Judges	8	18	Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna , “ What were the men like that you killed on Mount Tabor ? ” They answered , “ They were like you . Each one of them looked like a prince. ”
NCV	Judges	8	19	Gideon said , “ Those were my brothers , my mother ’ s sons . As surely as the Lord lives , I would not kill you if you had spared them. ”
NCV	Judges	8	20	Then Gideon said to Jether , his oldest son , “ Kill them. ” But Jether was only a boy and was afraid , so he did not take out his sword .
NCV	Judges	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon , “ Come on . Kill us yourself . As the saying goes , ‘ It takes a man to do a man ’ s job. ’ ” So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the decorations off their camels ’ necks . Gideon Makes an Idol
NCV	Judges	8	22	The people of Israel said to Gideon , “ You saved us from the Midianites . Now , we want you and your son and your grandson to rule over us. ”
NCV	Judges	8	23	But Gideon told them , “ The Lord will be your ruler . I will not rule over you , nor will my son rule over you. ”
NCV	Judges	8	24	He said , “ I want you to do this one thing for me . I want each of you to give me a gold earring from the things you took in the fighting. ” ( The Ishmaelites [ a ] wore gold earrings . )
NCV	Judges	8	25	They said , “ We will gladly give you what you want. ” So they spread out a coat , and everyone threw down an earring from what he had taken .
NCV	Judges	8	26	The gold earrings weighed about forty-three pounds . This did not count the decorations , necklaces , and purple robes worn by the kings of Midian , nor the chains from the camels ’ necks .
NCV	Judges	8	27	Gideon used the gold to make a holy vest , which he put in his hometown of Ophrah . But all the Israelites were unfaithful to God and worshiped it , so it became a trap for Gideon and his family . The Death of Gideon
NCV	Judges	8	28	So Midian was under the rule of Israel ; they did not cause trouble anymore . And the land had peace for forty years , as long as Gideon was alive .
NCV	Judges	8	29	Gideon [ b ] son of Joash went to his home to live .
NCV	Judges	8	30	He had seventy sons of his own , because he had many wives .
NCV	Judges	8	31	He had a slave woman who lived in Shechem , and he had a son by her , whom he named Abimelech .
NCV	Judges	8	32	So Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age . He was buried in the tomb of Joash , his father , in Ophrah , where the Abiezrites live .
NCV	Judges	8	33	As soon as Gideon died , the people of Israel were again unfaithful to God and followed the Baals . They made Baal-Berith their god .

NCV	Judges	9	9	“ But the olive tree said , ‘ Men and gods are honored by my oil . Should I stop making it and go and sway over the other trees ? ’
NCV	Judges	9	2	“ Ask the leaders of Shechem , ‘ Is it better for the seventy sons of Gideon to rule over you or for one man to rule ? ’ Remember , I am your relative. ”
NCV	Judges	9	3	Abimelech ’ s uncles spoke to all the leaders of Shechem about this . And they decided to follow Abimelech , because they said , “ He is our relative. ”
NCV	Judges	9	4	So the leaders of Shechem gave Abimelech about one and three-quarter pounds of silver from the temple of the god Baal-Berith . Abimelech used the silver to hire some worthless , reckless men , who followed him wherever he went .
NCV	Judges	9	5	He went to Ophrah , the hometown of his father , and murdered his seventy brothers , the sons of Gideon . He killed them all on one stone . But Gideon ’ s youngest son , Jotham , hid from Abimelech and escaped .
NCV	Judges	9	6	Then all of the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree standing in Shechem . There they made Abimelech their king . Jotham ’ s Story
NCV	Judges	9	7	When Jotham heard this , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim . He shouted to the people : “ Listen to me , you leaders of Shechem , so that God will listen to you !
NCV	Judges	9	8	One day the trees decided to appoint a king to rule over them . They said to the olive tree , ‘ You be king over us ! ’
NCV	Judges	9	10	“ Then the trees said to the fig tree , ‘ Come and be king over us ! ’
NCV	Judges	9	11	“ But the fig tree answered , ‘ Should I stop making my sweet and good fruit and go and sway over the other trees ? ’
NCV	Judges	9	12	“ Then the trees said to the vine , ‘ Come and be king over us ! ’
NCV	Judges	9	13	“ But the vine answered , ‘ My new wine makes men and gods happy . Should I stop making it and go and sway over the trees ? ’
NCV	Judges	9	14	“ Then all the trees said to the thornbush , ‘ Come and be king over us. ’
NCV	Judges	9	15	“ But the thornbush said to the trees , ‘ If you really want to appoint me king over you , come and find shelter in my shade ! But if not , let fire come out of the thornbush and burn up the cedars of Lebanon ! ’
NCV	Judges	9	16	“ Now , were you completely honest and sincere when you made Abimelech king ? Have you been fair to Gideon [ a ] and his family ? Have you treated Gideon as you should ?
NCV	Judges	9	17	Remember , my father fought for you and risked his life to save you from the power of the Midianites .
NCV	Judges	9	18	But now you have turned against my father ’ s family and have killed his seventy sons on one stone . You have made Abimelech , the son of my father ’ s slave girl , king over the leaders of Shechem just because he is your relative !
NCV	Judges	9	19	So then , if you have been honest and sincere to Gideon and his family today , be happy with Abimelech as your king . And may he be happy with you !
NCV	Judges	9	20	But if not , may fire come out of Abimelech and completely burn you leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo ! Also may fire come out of the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo and burn up Abimelech ! ”
NCV	Judges	9	21	Then Jotham ran away and escaped to the city of Beer . He lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech . Abimelech Fights Against Shechem
NCV	Judges	9	22	Abimelech ruled Israel for three years .
NCV	Judges	9	23	Then God sent an evil spirit to make trouble between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem so that the leaders of Shechem turned against him .
NCV	Judges	9	24	Abimelech had killed Gideon ’ s [ b ] seventy sons , his own brothers , and the leaders of Shechem had helped him . So God sent the evil spirit to punish them .
NCV	Judges	9	25	The leaders of Shechem were against Abimelech then . They put men on the hilltops in ambush who robbed everyone going by . And Abimelech was told .
NCV	Judges	9	26	A man named Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers moved into Shechem , and the leaders of Shechem trusted him .
NCV	Judges	9	27	They went out to the vineyards to pick grapes , and they squeezed the grapes . Then they had a feast in the temple of their god , where they ate and drank and cursed Abimelech .
NCV	Judges	9	28	Gaal son of Ebed said , “ We are the men of Shechem . Who is Abimelech that we should serve him ? Isn ’ t he one of Gideon ’ s sons , and isn ’ t Zebul his officer ? We should serve the men of Hamor , Shechem ’ s father . Why should we serve Abimelech ?
NCV	Judges	9	29	If you made me commander of these people , I would get rid of Abimelech . I would say to him , ‘ Get your army ready and come out to battle. ’ ”
NCV	Judges	9	30	Now when Zebul , the ruler of Shechem , heard what Gaal son of Ebed said , he was very angry .
NCV	Judges	9	31	He sent secret messengers to Abimelech , saying , “ Gaal son of Ebed and Gaal ’ s brothers have come to Shechem , and they are turning the city against you !
NCV	Judges	9	32	You and your men should get up during the night and hide in the fields outside the city .
NCV	Judges	9	33	As soon as the sun comes up in the morning , attack the city . When Gaal and his men come out to fight you , do what you can to them. ”
NCV	Judges	9	34	So Abimelech and all his soldiers got up during the night and hid near Shechem in four groups .
NCV	Judges	9	35	Gaal son of Ebed went out and was standing at the entrance to the city gate . As he was standing there , Abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places .
NCV	Judges	9	36	When Gaal saw the soldiers , he said to Zebul , “ Look ! There are people coming down from the mountains ! ” But Zebul said , “ You are seeing the shadows of the mountains . The shadows just look like people. ”
NCV	Judges	9	37	But again Gaal said , “ Look , there are people coming down from the center of the land , and there is a group coming from the fortune-tellers ’ tree ! ”
NCV	Judges	9	38	Zebul said to Gaal , “ Where is your bragging now ? You said , ‘ Who is Abimelech that we should serve him ? ’ You made fun of these men . Now go out and fight them. ”
NCV	Judges	9	39	So Gaal led the men of Shechem out to fight Abimelech .
NCV	Judges	9	40	Abimelech and his men chased them , and many of Gaal ’ s men were killed before they could get back to the city gate .
NCV	Judges	9	41	While Abimelech stayed at Arumah , Zebul forced Gaal and his brothers to leave Shechem .
NCV	Judges	9	42	The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields . When Abimelech was told about it ,
NCV	Judges	9	43	he separated his men into three groups and hid them in the fields . When he saw the people coming out of the city , he jumped up and attacked them .
NCV	Judges	9	44	Abimelech and his group ran to the entrance gate to the city . The other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and struck them down .
NCV	Judges	9	45	Abimelech and his men fought the city of Shechem all day until they captured it and killed its people . Then he tore it down and threw salt [ c ] over the ruins . The Tower of Shechem Burns
NCV	Judges	9	46	When the leaders who were in the Tower of Shechem heard what had happened to Shechem , they gathered in the safest room of the temple of El Berith .
NCV	Judges	9	47	Abimelech heard that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem had gathered there .
NCV	Judges	9	48	So he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon , near Shechem . Abimelech took an ax and cut some branches and put them on his shoulders . He said to all those with him , “ Hurry ! Do what I have done ! ”

NCV	Judges	10	11	The Lord answered the Israelites , “ When the Egyptians , Amorites , Ammonites , Philistines ,

NCV	Judges	11	2	Gilead ’ s wife had several sons . When they grew up , they forced Jephthah to leave his home , saying to him , “ You will not get any of our father ’ s property , because you are the son of another woman. ”
NCV	Judges	11	3	So Jephthah ran away from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob . There some worthless men began to follow him .
NCV	Judges	11	4	After a time the Ammonites fought against Israel .
NCV	Judges	11	5	When the Ammonites made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to Jephthah to bring him back from Tob .
NCV	Judges	11	6	They said to him , “ Come and lead our army so we can fight the Ammonites. ”
NCV	Judges	11	7	But Jephthah said to them , “ Didn ’ t you hate me ? You forced me to leave my father ’ s house . Why are you coming to me now that you are in trouble ? ”
NCV	Judges	11	8	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , “ It is because of those troubles that we come to you now . Please come with us and fight against the Ammonites . You will be the ruler over everyone who lives in Gilead. ”
NCV	Judges	11	9	Then Jephthah answered , “ If you take me back to Gilead to fight the Ammonites and the Lord helps me win , I will be your ruler. ”
NCV	Judges	11	10	The elders of Gilead said to him , “ The Lord is listening to everything we are saying . We promise to do all that you tell us to do. ”
NCV	Judges	11	12	Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites , asking , “ What have you got against Israel ? Why have you come to attack our land ? ”
NCV	Judges	11	13	The king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah , “ We are fighting Israel because you took our land when you came up from Egypt . You took our land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River to the Jordan River . Now give our land back to us peacefully. ”
NCV	Judges	11	14	Jephthah sent the messengers to the Ammonite king again .
NCV	Judges	11	15	They said : “ This is what Jephthah says : Israel did not take the land of the people of Moab or Ammon .
NCV	Judges	11	16	When the Israelites came out of Egypt , they went into the desert to the Red Sea and then to Kadesh .
NCV	Judges	11	17	Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , ‘ Let the people of Israel go across your land. ’ But the king of Edom refused . We sent the same message to the king of Moab , but he also refused . So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh .
NCV	Judges	11	18	“ Then the Israelites went into the desert around the borders of the lands of Edom and Moab . Israel went east of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon River , the border of Moab . They did not cross it to go into the land of Moab .
NCV	Judges	11	19	“ Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , king of the city of Heshbon , asking , ‘ Let the people of Israel pass through your land to go to our land. ’
NCV	Judges	11	20	But Sihon did not trust the Israelites to cross his land . So he gathered all of his people and camped at Jahaz and fought with Israel .
NCV	Judges	11	21	“ But the Lord , the God of Israel , handed Sihon and his army over to Israel . All the land of the Amorites became the property of Israel .
NCV	Judges	11	22	So Israel took all the land of the Amorites from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River , from the desert to the Jordan River .
NCV	Judges	11	23	“ It was the Lord , the God of Israel , who forced out the Amorites ahead of the people of Israel . So do you think you can make them leave ?
NCV	Judges	11	24	Take the land that your god Chemosh has given you . We will live in the land the Lord our God has given us !
NCV	Judges	11	25	“ Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor , king of Moab ? Did he ever quarrel or fight with the people of Israel ?
NCV	Judges	11	26	For three hundred years the Israelites have lived in Heshbon and Aroer and the towns around them and in all the cities along the Arnon River . Why have you not taken these cities back in all that time ?
NCV	Judges	11	27	I have not sinned against you , but you are sinning against me by making war on me . May the Lord , the Judge , decide whether the Israelites or the Ammonites are right. ”
NCV	Judges	11	28	But the king of the Ammonites ignored this message from Jephthah . Jephthah ’ s Promise
NCV	Judges	11	29	Then the Spirit of the Lord entered Jephthah . Jephthah passed through Gilead and Manasseh and the city of Mizpah in Gilead to the land of the Ammonites .

NCV	Judges	11	31	I will give you as a burnt offering the first thing that comes out of my house to meet me when I return from the victory . It will be the Lord ’ s. ”
NCV	Judges	11	32	Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites , and the Lord handed them over to him .
NCV	Judges	11	33	In a great defeat Jephthah struck them down from the city of Aroer to the area of Minnith , and twenty cities as far as the city of Abel Keramim . So the Ammonites were defeated by the Israelites .
NCV	Judges	11	34	When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah , his daughter was the first one to come out to meet him , playing a tambourine and dancing . She was his only child ; he had no other sons or daughters .
NCV	Judges	11	35	When Jephthah saw his daughter , he tore his clothes to show his sorrow . He said , “ My daughter ! You have made me so sad because I made a promise to the Lord , and I can not break it ! ”
NCV	Judges	11	36	Then his daughter said , “ Father , you made a promise to the Lord . So do to me just what you promised , because the Lord helped you defeat your enemies , the Ammonites. ”
NCV	Judges	11	37	She also said , “ But let me do one thing . Let me be alone for two months to go to the mountains . Since I will never marry , let me and my friends go and cry together. ”
NCV	Judges	11	38	Jephthah said , “ Go. ” So he sent her away for two months . She and her friends stayed in the mountains and cried for her because she would never marry .
NCV	Judges	11	39	After two months she returned to her father , and Jephthah did to her what he had promised . Jephthah ’ s daughter never had a husband . From this came a custom in Israel that

NCV	Judges	12	3	When I saw that you would not help me , I risked my own life and went against the Ammonites . The Lord handed them over to me . So why have you come to fight against me today ? ”
NCV	Judges	12	4	Then Jephthah called the men of Gilead together and fought the men of Ephraim . The men of Gilead struck them down because the Ephraimites had said , “ You men of Gilead are nothing but deserters from Ephraim—living between Ephraim and Manasseh. ”
NCV	Judges	12	5	The men of Gilead captured the crossings of the Jordan River that led to the country of Ephraim . A person from Ephraim trying to escape would say , “ Let me cross the river. ” Then the men of Gilead would ask him , “ Are you from Ephraim ? ” If he replied no ,
NCV	Judges	12	6	they would say to him , “ Say the word ‘ Shibboleth. ’ ” The men of Ephraim could not say that word correctly . So if the person from Ephraim said , “ Sibboleth , ” the men of Gilead would kill him at the crossing . So forty-two thousand people from Ephraim were killed at that time .

NCV	Judges	13	13	The angel of the Lord said , “ Your wife must be careful to do everything I told her to do .
NCV	Judges	13	2	There was a man named Manoah from the tribe of Dan , who lived in the city of Zorah . He had a wife , but she could not have children .
NCV	Judges	13	3	The angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah ’ s wife and said , “ You have not been able to have children , but you will become pregnant and give birth to a son .
NCV	Judges	13	4	Be careful not to drink wine or beer or eat anything that is unclean ,
NCV	Judges	13	5	because you will become pregnant and have a son . You must never cut his hair , because he will be a Nazirite , given to God from birth . He will begin to save Israel from the power of the Philistines. ”
NCV	Judges	13	6	Then Manoah ’ s wife went to him and told him what had happened . She said , “ A man from God came to me . He looked like an angel from God ; his appearance was frightening . I didn ’ t ask him where he was from , and he didn ’ t tell me his name .
NCV	Judges	13	7	But he said to me , ‘ You will become pregnant and will have a son . Don ’ t drink wine or beer or eat anything that is unclean , because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from his birth until the day of his death. ’ ”
NCV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord : “ Lord , I beg you to let the man of God come to us again . Let him teach us what we should do for the boy who will be born to us. ”
NCV	Judges	13	9	God heard Manoah ’ s prayer , and the angel of God came to Manoah ’ s wife again while she was sitting in the field . But her husband Manoah was not with her .
NCV	Judges	13	10	So she ran to tell him , “ He is here ! The man who appeared to me the other day is here ! ”
NCV	Judges	13	11	Manoah got up and followed his wife . When he came to the man , he said , “ Are you the man who spoke to my wife ? ” The man said , “ I am. ”
NCV	Judges	13	12	So Manoah asked , “ When what you say happens , what kind of life should the boy live ? What should he do ? ”
NCV	Judges	13	14	She must not eat anything that grows on a grapevine , or drink any wine or beer , or eat anything that is unclean . She must do everything I have commanded her. ”
NCV	Judges	13	15	Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ We would like you to stay awhile so we can cook a young goat for you. ”
NCV	Judges	13	16	The angel of the Lord answered , “ Even if I stay awhile , I would not eat your food . But if you want to prepare something , offer a burnt offering to the Lord. ” ( Manoah did not understand that the man was really the angel of the Lord . )
NCV	Judges	13	17	Then Manoah asked the angel of the Lord , “ What is your name ? Then we will honor you when what you have said really happens. ”
NCV	Judges	13	18	The angel of the Lord said , “ Why do you ask my name ? It is too amazing for you to understand. ”
NCV	Judges	13	19	So Manoah sacrificed a young goat on a rock and offered some grain as a gift to the Lord . Then an amazing thing happened as Manoah and his wife watched .
NCV	Judges	13	20	The flames went up to the sky from the altar . As the fire burned , the angel of the Lord went up to heaven in the flame . When Manoah and his wife saw that , they bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	Judges	13	21	The angel of the Lord did not appear to them again . Then Manoah understood that the man was really the angel of the Lord .
NCV	Judges	13	22	Manoah said , “ We have seen God , so we will surely die. ”
NCV	Judges	13	23	But his wife said to him , “ If the Lord wanted to kill us , he would not have accepted our burnt offering or grain offering . He would not have shown us all these things or told us all this. ”
NCV	Judges	13	24	So the woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson . He grew , and the Lord blessed him .

NCV	Judges	14	14	Samson said , “ Out of the eater comes something to eat . Out of the strong comes something sweet. ” After three days , they had not found the answer .
NCV	Judges	14	2	When he returned home , he said to his father and mother , “ I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah . I want you to get her for me so I can marry her. ”
NCV	Judges	14	3	His father and mother answered , “ Surely there is a woman from Israel you can marry . Do you have to marry a woman from the Philistines , who are not circumcised ? ” But Samson said , “ Get that woman for me ! She is the one I want ! ”
NCV	Judges	14	4	( Samson ’ s parents did not know that the Lord wanted this to happen because he was looking for a way to challenge the Philistines , who were ruling over Israel at this time . )
NCV	Judges	14	5	Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah , as far as the vineyard near there . Suddenly , a young lion came roaring toward Samson !
NCV	Judges	14	6	The Spirit of the Lord entered Samson with great power , and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands . For him it was as easy as tearing apart a young goat . But Samson did not tell his father or mother what he had done .
NCV	Judges	14	7	Then he went down to the city and talked to the Philistine woman , and he liked her .
NCV	Judges	14	8	Several days later Samson went back to marry her . On his way he went over to look at the body of the dead lion and found a swarm of bees and honey in it .
NCV	Judges	14	9	Samson got some of the honey with his hands and walked along eating it . When he came to his parents , he gave some to them . They ate it , too , but Samson did not tell them he had taken the honey from the body of the dead lion .
NCV	Judges	14	10	Samson ’ s father went down to see the Philistine woman . And Samson gave a feast , as was the custom for the bridegroom .
NCV	Judges	14	11	When the people saw him , they sent thirty friends to be with him . Samson ’ s Riddle
NCV	Judges	14	12	Samson said to them , “ Let me tell you a riddle . Try to find the answer during the seven days of the feast . If you can , I will give you thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of clothes .
NCV	Judges	14	13	But if you can ’ t , you must give me thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of clothes. ” So they said , “ Tell us your riddle so we can hear it. ”
NCV	Judges	14	15	On the fourth [ a ] day they said to Samson ’ s wife , “ Did you invite us here to make us poor ? Trick your husband into telling us the answer to the riddle . If you don ’ t , we will burn you and everyone in your father ’ s house. ”
NCV	Judges	14	16	So Samson ’ s wife went to him , crying , and said , “ You hate me ! You don ’ t really love me ! You told my people a riddle , but you won ’ t tell me the answer. ” Samson said , “ I haven ’ t even told my father or mother . Why should I tell you ? ”
NCV	Judges	14	17	Samson ’ s wife cried for the rest of the seven days of the feast . So he finally gave her the answer on the seventh day , because she kept bothering him . Then she told her people the answer to the riddle .
NCV	Judges	14	18	Before sunset on the seventh day of the feast , the Philistine men had the answer . They came to Samson and said , “ What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? ” Then Samson said to them , “ If you had not plowed with my young cow , you would not have solved my riddle ! ”
NCV	Judges	14	19	Then the Spirit of the Lord entered Samson and gave him great power . Samson went down to the city of Ashkelon and killed thirty of its men and took all that they had and gave the clothes to the men who had answered his riddle . Then he went to his father ’ s house very angry .
NCV	Judges	14	20	And Samson ’ s wife was given to his best man . Footnotes - 14:15 fourth The Hebrew word is “ seventh. ” Some old translations say “ fourth , ” which fits the order of events better . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Judges	15	15	Samson found the jawbone of a dead donkey , took it , and killed a thousand men with it !
NCV	Judges	15	2	He said to Samson , “ I thought you really hated your wife , so I gave her to your best man . Her younger sister is more beautiful . Take her instead. ”
NCV	Judges	15	3	But Samson said to them , “ This time no one will blame me for hurting you Philistines ! ”
NCV	Judges	15	4	So Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes . He took two foxes at a time , tied their tails together , and then tied a torch to the tails of each pair of foxes .
NCV	Judges	15	5	After he lit the torches , he let the foxes loose in the grainfields of the Philistines so that he burned up their standing grain , the piles of grain , their vineyards , and their olive trees .
NCV	Judges	15	6	The Philistines asked , “ Who did this ? ” Someone told them , “ Samson , the son-in-law of the man from Timnah , did because his father-in-law gave his wife to his best man. ” So the Philistines burned Samson ’ s wife and her father to death .
NCV	Judges	15	7	Then Samson said to the Philistines , “ Since you did this , I won ’ t stop until I pay you back ! ”
NCV	Judges	15	8	Samson attacked the Philistines and killed many of them . Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam .
NCV	Judges	15	9	The Philistines went up and camped in the land of Judah , near a place named Lehi .
NCV	Judges	15	10	The men of Judah asked them , “ Why have you come here to fight us ? ” They answered , “ We have come to make Samson our prisoner , to pay him back for what he did to our people. ”
NCV	Judges	15	11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson , “ What have you done to us ? Don ’ t you know that the Philistines rule over us ? ” Samson answered , “ I only paid them back for what they did to me. ”
NCV	Judges	15	12	Then they said to him , “ We have come to tie you up and to hand you over to the Philistines. ” Samson said to them , “ Promise me you will not hurt me yourselves. ”
NCV	Judges	15	13	The men from Judah said , “ We agree . We will just tie you up and give you to the Philistines . We will not kill you. ” So they tied Samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock .
NCV	Judges	15	14	When Samson came to the place named Lehi , the Philistines came to meet him , shouting for joy . Then the Spirit of the Lord entered Samson and gave him great power . The ropes on him weakened like burned strings and fell off his hands !
NCV	Judges	15	16	Then Samson said , “ With a donkey ’ s jawbone I made donkeys out of them . With a donkey ’ s jawbone I killed a thousand men ! ”
NCV	Judges	15	17	When he finished speaking , he threw away the jawbone . So that place was named Ramath Lehi . [ a ]
NCV	Judges	15	18	Samson was very thirsty , so he cried out to the Lord , “ You gave me , your servant , this great victory . Do I have to die of thirst now ? Do I have to be captured by people who are not circumcised ? ”
NCV	Judges	15	19	Then God opened up a hole in the ground at Lehi , and water came out . When Samson drank , he felt better ; he felt strong again . So he named that spring Caller ’ s Spring , which is still in Lehi .

NCV	Judges	16	16	She kept bothering Samson about his secret day after day until he felt he was going to die !
NCV	Judges	16	2	When the people of Gaza heard , “ Samson has come here ! ” they surrounded the place and waited for him near the city gate all night . They whispered to each other , “ When dawn comes , we will kill Samson ! ”
NCV	Judges	16	3	But Samson only stayed with the prostitute until midnight . Then he got up and took hold of the doors and the two posts of the city gate and tore them loose , along with the bar . He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces the city of Hebron . Samson and Delilah
NCV	Judges	16	4	After this , Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah , who lived in the Valley of Sorek .
NCV	Judges	16	5	The Philistine rulers went to Delilah and said , “ Find out what makes Samson so strong . Trick him into telling you how we can overpower him and capture him and tie him up . If you do this , each one of us will give you twenty-eight pounds of silver. ”
NCV	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , “ Tell me why you are so strong . How can someone tie you up and capture you ? ”
NCV	Judges	16	7	Samson answered , “ Someone would have to tie me up with seven new bowstrings that have not been dried . Then I would be as weak as any other man. ”
NCV	Judges	16	8	The Philistine rulers brought Delilah seven new bowstrings that had not been dried , and she tied Samson with them .
NCV	Judges	16	9	Some men were hiding in another room . Delilah said to him , “ Samson , the Philistines are here ! ” But Samson broke the bowstrings like pieces of burned string . So the Philistines did not find out the secret of Samson ’ s strength .
NCV	Judges	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ You made a fool of me . You lied to me . Now tell me how someone can tie you up. ”
NCV	Judges	16	11	Samson said , “ They would have to tie me with new ropes that have not been used before . Then I would become as weak as any other man. ”
NCV	Judges	16	12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied Samson . Some men were hiding in another room . She called out to him , “ Samson , the Philistines are here ! ” But he broke the ropes as easily as if they were threads .
NCV	Judges	16	13	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ Again you have made a fool of me . You lied to me . Tell me how someone can tie you up. ” He said , “ Using the loom , [ a ] weave the seven braids of my hair into the cloth , and tighten it with a pin . Then I will be as weak as any other man. ” While Samson slept , Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the cloth .
NCV	Judges	16	14	Then she fastened it with a pin . Again she said to him , “ Samson , the Philistines are here ! ” Samson woke up and pulled out the pin and the loom with the cloth .
NCV	Judges	16	15	Then Delilah said to him , “ How can you say , ‘ I love you , ’ when you don ’ t even trust me ? This is the third time you have made a fool of me . You haven ’ t told me the secret of your great strength. ”
NCV	Judges	16	17	So he told her everything . He said , “ I have never had my hair cut , because I have been set apart to God as a Nazirite since I was born . If someone shaved my head , I would lose my strength and be as weak as any other man. ”
NCV	Judges	16	18	When Delilah saw that he had told her everything sincerely , she sent a message to the Philistine rulers . She said , “ Come back one more time , because he has told me everything. ” So the Philistine rulers came back to Delilah and brought the silver with them .
NCV	Judges	16	19	Delilah got Samson to sleep , lying in her lap . Then she called in a man to shave off the seven braids of Samson ’ s hair . In this way she began to make him weak , and his strength left him .
NCV	Judges	16	20	Then she said , “ Samson , the Philistines are here ! ” He woke up and thought , “ I ’ ll leave as I did before and shake myself free. ” But he did not know that the Lord had left him .
NCV	Judges	16	21	Then the Philistines captured Samson and tore out his eyes . They took him down to Gaza , where they put bronze chains on him and made him grind grain in the prison .
NCV	Judges	16	22	But his hair began to grow again . Samson Dies
NCV	Judges	16	23	The Philistine rulers gathered to celebrate and to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon . They said , “ Our god has handed Samson our enemy over to us. ”
NCV	Judges	16	24	When the people saw him , they praised their god , saying , “ This man destroyed our country . He killed many of us ! But our god handed over our enemy to us. ”
NCV	Judges	16	25	While the people were enjoying the celebration , they said , “ Bring Samson out to perform for us. ” So they brought Samson from the prison , and he performed for them . They made him stand between the pillars .
NCV	Judges	16	26	Samson said to the servant holding his hand , “ Let me feel the pillars that hold up the temple so I can lean against them. ”
NCV	Judges	16	27	Now the temple was full of men and women . All the Philistine rulers were there , and about three thousand men and women were on the roof [ b ] watching Samson perform .
NCV	Judges	16	28	Then Samson prayed to the Lord , “ Lord God , remember me . God , please give me strength one more time so I can pay these Philistines back for putting out my two eyes ! ”
NCV	Judges	16	29	Then Samson turned to the two center pillars that supported the whole temple . He braced himself between the two pillars , with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other .
NCV	Judges	16	30	Samson said , “ Let me die with these Philistines ! ” Then he pushed as hard as he could , causing the temple to fall on the rulers and all the people in it . So Samson killed more of the Philistines when he died than when he was alive .
NCV	Judges	16	31	Samson ’ s brothers and his whole family went down to get his body . They brought him back and buried him in the tomb of Manoah , his father , between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol . Samson was a judge for the people of Israel for twenty years .

NCV	Judges	17	17	There was a man named Micah who lived in the mountains of Ephraim .
NCV	Judges	17	2	He said to his mother , “ I heard you speak a curse about the twenty-eight pounds of silver that were taken from you . I have the silver with me ; I took it. ” His mother said , “ The Lord bless you , my son ! ”
NCV	Judges	17	3	Micah gave the twenty-eight pounds of silver to his mother . Then she said , “ I will give this silver to the Lord . I will have my son make an idol and a statue . So I will give the silver back to you. ”
NCV	Judges	17	4	When he gave the silver back to his mother , she took about five pounds and gave it to a silversmith . With it he made an idol and a statue , which stood in Micah ’ s house .
NCV	Judges	17	5	Micah had a special holy place , and he made a holy vest and some household idols . Then Micah chose one of his sons to be his priest .
NCV	Judges	17	6	At that time Israel did not have a king , so everyone did what seemed right .
NCV	Judges	17	7	There was a young man who was a Levite [ a ] from the city of Bethlehem in Judah who was from the people of Judah .
NCV	Judges	17	8	He left Bethlehem to look for another place to live , and on his way he came to Micah ’ s house in the mountains of Ephraim .
NCV	Judges	17	9	Micah asked him , “ Where are you from ? ” He answered , “ I ’ m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah . I ’ m looking for a place to live. ”
NCV	Judges	17	10	Micah said to him , “ Live with me and be my father and my priest . I will give you four ounces of silver each year and clothes and food. ” So the Levite went in .
NCV	Judges	17	11	He agreed to live with Micah and became like one of Micah ’ s own sons .
NCV	Judges	17	12	Micah made him a priest , and he lived in Micah ’ s house .
NCV	Judges	17	13	Then Micah said , “ Now I know the Lord will be good to me , because I have a Levite as my priest. ” Footnotes - 17:7 Levite The Levites were the only ones God had appointed as priests . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Judges	18	18	When the spies went into Micah ’ s house and took the image , the holy vest , the household idols , and the statue , the priest asked them , “ What are you doing ? ”
NCV	Judges	18	2	So , from their family groups , they chose five soldiers from the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out and explore the land . They were told , “ Go , explore the land. ” They came to the mountains of Ephraim , to Micah ’ s house , where they spent the night .
NCV	Judges	18	3	When they came near Micah ’ s house , they recognized the voice of the young Levite . [ a ] So they stopped there and asked him , “ Who brought you here ? What are you doing here ? Why are you here ? ”
NCV	Judges	18	4	He told them what Micah had done for him , saying , “ He hired me . I am his priest. ”
NCV	Judges	18	5	They said to him , “ Please ask God if our journey will be successful. ”
NCV	Judges	18	6	The priest said to them , “ Go in peace . The Lord is pleased with your journey. ”
NCV	Judges	18	7	So the five men left . When they came to the city of Laish , they saw that the people there lived in safety , like the people of Sidon . They thought they were safe and had plenty of everything . They lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else .
NCV	Judges	18	8	When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol , their relatives asked them , “ What did you find ? ”
NCV	Judges	18	9	They answered , “ We have seen the land , and it is very good . We should attack them . Aren ’ t you going to do something ? Don ’ t wait ! Let ’ s go and take that land !
NCV	Judges	18	10	When you go , you will see there is plenty of land—plenty of everything ! The people are not expecting an attack . Surely God has handed that land over to us ! ”
NCV	Judges	18	11	So six hundred Danites left Zorah and Eshtaol ready for war .
NCV	Judges	18	12	On their way they set up camp near the city of Kiriath Jearim in Judah . That is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is named Mahaneh Dan [ b ] to this day .
NCV	Judges	18	13	From there they traveled on to the mountains of Ephraim . Then they came to Micah ’ s house .
NCV	Judges	18	14	The five men who had explored the land around Laish said to their relatives , “ Do you know in one of these houses there are a holy vest , household gods , an idol , and a statue ? You know what to do. ”
NCV	Judges	18	15	So they stopped at the Levite ’ s house , which was also Micah ’ s house , and greeted the Levite .
NCV	Judges	18	16	The six hundred Danites stood at the entrance gate , wearing their weapons of war .
NCV	Judges	18	17	The five spies went into the house and took the idol , the holy vest , the household idols , and the statue . The priest and the six hundred men armed for war stood by the entrance gate .
NCV	Judges	18	19	They answered , “ Be quiet ! Don ’ t say a word . Come with us and be our father and priest . Is it better for you to be a priest for one man ’ s house or for a tribe and family group in Israel ? ”
NCV	Judges	18	20	This made the priest happy . So he took the holy vest , the household idols , and the idol and went with the Danites .
NCV	Judges	18	21	They left Micah ’ s house , putting their little children , their animals , and everything they owned in front of them .
NCV	Judges	18	22	When they had gone a little way from Micah ’ s house , the men who lived near Micah were called out and caught up with them .
NCV	Judges	18	23	The men with Micah shouted at the Danites , who turned around and said to Micah , “ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why have you been called out to fight ? ”
NCV	Judges	18	24	Micah answered , “ You took my gods that I made and my priest . What do I have left ? How can you ask me , ‘ What ’ s the matter ? ’ ”
NCV	Judges	18	25	The Danites answered , “ You should not argue with us . Some of our angry men might attack you , killing you and your family. ”
NCV	Judges	18	26	Then the Danites went on their way . Micah knew they were too strong for him , so he turned and went back home .
NCV	Judges	18	27	Then the Danites took what Micah had made and his priest and went on to Laish . They attacked those peaceful people and killed them with their swords and then burned the city .
NCV	Judges	18	28	There was no one to save the people of Laish . They lived too far from Sidon , and they had no dealings with anyone else . Laish was in a valley near Beth Rehob . The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived there .
NCV	Judges	18	29	They changed the name of Laish to Dan , naming it for their ancestor Dan , one of the sons of Israel .
NCV	Judges	18	30	The people of Dan set up the idols in the city of Dan . Jonathan son of Gershom , Moses ’ son , and his sons served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the land was captured .

NCV	Judges	19	19	We already have straw and food for our donkeys and bread and wine for me , the young woman , and my servant . We don ’ t need anything. ”
NCV	Judges	19	2	but she was unfaithful to him . She left him and went back to her father ’ s house in Bethlehem in Judah and stayed there for four months .
NCV	Judges	19	3	Then her husband went to ask her to come back to him , taking with him his servant and two donkeys . When the Levite came to her father ’ s house , she invited him to come in , and her father was happy to see him .
NCV	Judges	19	4	The father-in-law , the young woman ’ s father , asked him to stay . So he stayed for three days and ate , drank , and slept there .
NCV	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day they got up early in the morning . The Levite was getting ready to leave , but the woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , “ Refresh yourself by eating something . Then go. ”
NCV	Judges	19	6	So the two men sat down to eat and drink together . After that , the father said to him , “ Please stay tonight . Relax and enjoy yourself. ”
NCV	Judges	19	7	When the man got up to go , his father-in-law asked him to stay . So he stayed again that night .
NCV	Judges	19	8	On the fifth day the man got up early in the morning to leave . The woman ’ s father said , “ Refresh yourself . Wait until this afternoon. ” So the two men ate together .
NCV	Judges	19	9	When the Levite , his slave woman , and his servant got up to leave , the father-in-law , the young woman ’ s father , said , “ It ’ s almost night . The day is almost gone . Spend the night here and enjoy yourself . Tomorrow morning you can get up early and go home. ”
NCV	Judges	19	10	But the Levite did not want to stay another night . So he took his two saddled donkeys and his slave woman and traveled toward the city of Jebus ( also called Jerusalem ) .
NCV	Judges	19	11	As the day was almost over , they came near Jebus . So the servant said to his master , “ Let ’ s stop at this city of the Jebusites , and spend the night here. ”
NCV	Judges	19	12	But his master said , “ No . We won ’ t go inside a foreign city . Those people are not Israelites . We will go on to the city of Gibeah. ”
NCV	Judges	19	13	He said , “ Come on . Let ’ s try to make it to Gibeah or Ramah so we can spend the night in one of those cities. ”
NCV	Judges	19	14	So they went on . The sun went down as they came near Gibeah , which belongs to the tribe of Benjamin .
NCV	Judges	19	15	They stopped there to spend the night . They came to the public square of the city and sat down , but no one invited them home to spend the night .
NCV	Judges	19	16	Finally , in the evening an old man came in from his work in the fields . His home was in the mountains of Ephraim , but now he was living in Gibeah . ( The people of Gibeah were from the tribe of Benjamin . )
NCV	Judges	19	17	He saw the traveler in the public square and asked , “ Where are you going ? Where did you come from ? ”
NCV	Judges	19	18	The Levite answered , “ We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to my home in the mountains of Ephraim . I have been to Bethlehem in Judah , but now I am going to the Holy Tent of the Lord . No one has invited me to stay in his house .
NCV	Judges	19	20	The old man said , “ You are welcome to stay at my house . Let me give you anything you need , but don ’ t spend the night in the public square. ”
NCV	Judges	19	21	So the old man took the Levite into his house , and he fed their donkeys . They washed their feet and had something to eat and drink .
NCV	Judges	19	22	While they were enjoying themselves , some wicked men of the city surrounded the house and beat on the door . They shouted to the old man who owned the house , “ Bring out the man who came to your house . We want to have sexual relations with him. ”
NCV	Judges	19	23	The owner of the house went outside and said to them , “ No , my friends . Don ’ t be so evil . This man is a guest in my house . Don ’ t do this terrible thing !
NCV	Judges	19	24	Look , here are my daughter , who has never had sexual relations before , and the man ’ s slave woman . I will bring them out to you now . Do anything you want with them , but don ’ t do such a terrible thing to this man. ”
NCV	Judges	19	25	But the men would not listen to him . So the Levite took his slave woman and sent her outside to them . They forced her to have sexual relations with them , and they abused her all night long . Then , at dawn , they let her go .
NCV	Judges	19	26	She came back to the house where her master was staying and fell down at the door and lay there until daylight .
NCV	Judges	19	27	In the morning when the Levite got up , he opened the door of the house and went outside to go on his way . But his slave woman was lying at the doorway of the house , with her hands on the doorsill .
NCV	Judges	19	28	The Levite said to her , “ Get up ; let ’ s go. ” But she did not answer . So he put her on his donkey and went home .
NCV	Judges	19	29	When the Levite got home , he took a knife and cut his slave woman into twelve parts , limb by limb . Then he sent a part to each area of Israel .

NCV	Judges	20	20	The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjaminites and took their battle position at Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	2	The leaders of all the tribes of Israel took their places in the meeting of the people of God . There were 400,000 soldiers with swords .
NCV	Judges	20	3	( The people of Benjamin heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah . ) Then the Israelites said to the Levite , “ Tell us how this evil thing happened. ”
NCV	Judges	20	4	So the husband of the murdered woman answered , “ My slave woman and I came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night .
NCV	Judges	20	5	During the night the men of Gibeah came after me . They surrounded the house and wanted to kill me . They forced my slave woman to have sexual relations and she died .
NCV	Judges	20	6	I took her and cut her into parts and sent one part to each area of Israel because the people of Benjamin did this wicked and terrible thing in Israel .
NCV	Judges	20	7	Now , all you Israelites , speak up . What is your decision ? ”
NCV	Judges	20	8	Then all the people stood up at the same time , saying , “ None of us will go home . Not one of us will go back to his house !
NCV	Judges	20	9	Now this is what we will do to Gibeah . We will throw lots .
NCV	Judges	20	10	That way we will choose ten men from every hundred men from all the tribes of Israel , and we will choose a hundred men from every thousand , and a thousand men from every ten thousand . These will find supplies for the army . Then the army will go to the city of Gibeah of Benjamin to repay them for the terrible thing they have done in Israel. ”
NCV	Judges	20	11	So all the men of Israel were united and gathered against the city .
NCV	Judges	20	12	The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin demanding , “ What is this evil thing some of your men have done ?
NCV	Judges	20	13	Hand over the wicked men in Gibeah so that we can put them to death . We must remove this evil from Israel. ” But the Benjaminites would not listen to their fellow Israelites .
NCV	Judges	20	14	The Benjaminites left their own cities and met at Gibeah to fight the Israelites .
NCV	Judges	20	15	In only one day the Benjaminites got 26,000 soldiers together who were trained with swords . They also had
NCV	Judges	20	700	chosen men from Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	16	Seven hundred of these trained soldiers were left-handed , each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss !
NCV	Judges	20	17	The Israelites , except for the Benjaminites , gathered 400,000 soldiers with swords .
NCV	Judges	20	18	The Israelites went up to the city of Bethel and asked God , “ Which tribe shall be first to attack the Benjaminites ? ” The Lord answered , “ Judah shall go first. ”
NCV	Judges	20	19	The next morning the Israelites got up and made a camp near Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	21	Then the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah and killed 22,000 Israelites during the battle that day . 22-23 The Israelites went before the Lord and cried until evening . They asked the Lord , “ Shall we go to fight our relatives , the Benjaminites , again ? ” The Lord answered , “ Go up and fight them. ” The men of Israel encouraged each other . So they took the same battle positions they had taken the first day .
NCV	Judges	20	24	The Israelites came to fight the Benjaminites the second day .
NCV	Judges	20	25	The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah to attack the Israelites . This time , the Benjaminites killed 18,000 Israelites , all of whom carried swords .
NCV	Judges	20	26	Then the Israelites went up to Bethel . There they sat down and cried to the Lord and fasted all day until evening . They also brought burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord .
NCV	Judges	20	27	The Israelites asked the Lord a question . ( In those days the Ark of the Agreement with God was there at Bethel .
NCV	Judges	20	28	A priest named Phinehas son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , served before the Ark of the Agreement . ) They asked , “ Shall we go to fight our relatives , the Benjaminites , again , or shall we stop fighting ? ” The Lord answered , “ Go , because tomorrow I will hand them over to you. ”
NCV	Judges	20	29	Then the Israelites set up ambushes all around Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	30	They went to fight against the Benjaminites at Gibeah on the third day , getting into position for battle as they had done before .
NCV	Judges	20	31	When the Benjaminites came out to fight them , the Israelites backed up and led the Benjaminites away from the city . The Benjaminites began to kill some of the Israelites as they had done before . About thirty Israelites were killed—some in the fields and some on the roads leading to Bethel and to Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	32	The Benjaminites said , “ We are winning as before ! ” But the Israelites said , “ Let ’ s run . Let ’ s trick them into going farther away from their city and onto the roads. ”
NCV	Judges	20	33	All the Israelites moved from their places and got into battle positions at a place named Baal Tamar . Then the Israelites ran out from their hiding places west of Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	34	Ten thousand of the best trained soldiers from all of Israel attacked Gibeah . The battle was very hard . The Benjaminites did not know disaster was about to come to them .
NCV	Judges	20	35	The Lord used the Israelites to defeat the Benjaminites . On that day the Israelites killed 25,100 Benjaminites , all armed with swords .
NCV	Judges	20	36	Then the Benjaminites saw that they were defeated . The Israelites had moved back because they were depending on the surprise attack they had set up near Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	37	The men in hiding rushed into Gibeah , spread out , and killed everyone in the city with their swords .
NCV	Judges	20	38	Now the Israelites had set up a signal with the men in hiding . The men in the surprise attack were to send up a cloud of smoke from the city .
NCV	Judges	20	39	Then the army of Israel turned around in the battle . The Benjaminites had killed about thirty Israelites . They were saying , “ We are winning , as in the first battle ! ”
NCV	Judges	20	40	But then a cloud of smoke began to rise from the city . The Benjaminites turned around and saw that the whole city was going up in smoke .
NCV	Judges	20	41	Then the Israelites turned and began to fight . The Benjaminites were terrified because they knew that disaster was coming to them .
NCV	Judges	20	42	So the Benjaminites ran away from the Israelites toward the desert , but they could not escape the battle . And the Israelites who came out of the cities killed them .
NCV	Judges	20	43	They surrounded the Benjaminites and chased them and caught them in the area east of Gibeah .
NCV	Judges	20	44	So 18,000 brave Benjaminite fighters were killed .
NCV	Judges	20	45	The Benjaminites ran toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon , but the Israelites killed 5,000 Benjaminites along the roads . They chased them as far as Gidom and killed 2,000 more Benjaminites there .
NCV	Judges	20	46	On that day 25,000 Benjaminites were killed , all of whom had fought bravely with swords .
NCV	Judges	20	47	But
NCV	Judges	20	600	Benjaminites ran to the rock of Rimmon in the desert , where they stayed for four months .
NCV	Judges	20	48	Then the Israelites went back to the land of Benjamin and killed the people in every city and also the animals and everything they could find .

NCV	Judges	21	21	Watch for the young women from Shiloh to come out to join the dancing . Then run out from the vineyards and take one of the young Shiloh women and return to the land of Benjamin .
NCV	Judges	21	2	The people went to the city of Bethel and sat before God until evening , crying loudly .
NCV	Judges	21	3	They said , “ Lord , God of Israel , why has this terrible thing happened to us so that one tribe of Israel is missing today ? ”
NCV	Judges	21	4	Early the next day the people built an altar and put burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to God on it .
NCV	Judges	21	5	Then the Israelites asked , “ Did any tribe of Israel not come here to meet with us in the presence of the Lord ? ” They asked this question because they had sworn that anyone who did not meet with them at Mizpah would be killed .
NCV	Judges	21	6	The Israelites felt sorry for their relatives , the Benjaminites . They said , “ Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel .
NCV	Judges	21	7	We swore before the Lord that we would not allow our daughters to marry a Benjaminite . How can we make sure that the remaining men of Benjamin will have wives ? ”
NCV	Judges	21	8	Then they asked , “ Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come here to Mizpah ? ” They found that no one from the city of Jabesh Gilead had come .
NCV	Judges	21	9	The people of Israel counted everyone , but there was no one from Jabesh Gilead .
NCV	Judges	21	10	So the whole group of Israelites sent twelve thousand soldiers to Jabesh Gilead to kill the people with their swords , even the women and children .
NCV	Judges	21	11	“ This is what you must do : Kill every man in Jabesh Gilead and every married woman. ”
NCV	Judges	21	12	The soldiers found four hundred young unmarried women in Jabesh Gilead , so they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan .
NCV	Judges	21	13	Then the whole group of Israelites sent a message to the men of Benjamin , who were at the rock of Rimmon , offering to make peace with them .
NCV	Judges	21	14	So the men of Benjamin came back at that time . The Israelites gave them the women from Jabesh Gilead who had not been killed , but there were not enough women .
NCV	Judges	21	15	The people of Israel felt sorry for the Benjaminites because the Lord had separated the tribes of Israel .
NCV	Judges	21	16	The elders of the Israelites said , “ The women of Benjamin have been killed . Where can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are still alive ?
NCV	Judges	21	17	These men must have children to continue their families so a tribe in Israel will not die out .
NCV	Judges	21	18	But we can not allow our daughters to marry them , because we swore , ‘ Anyone who gives a wife to a man of Benjamin is cursed. ’
NCV	Judges	21	19	We have an idea ! There is a yearly festival of the Lord at Shiloh , which is north of the city of Bethel , east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem , and south of the city of Lebonah. ”
NCV	Judges	21	20	So the elders told the men of Benjamin , “ Go and hide in the vineyards .
NCV	Judges	21	22	If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain , we will say : ‘ Be kind to the men of Benjamin . We did not get wives for Benjamin during the war , and you did not give the women to the men from Benjamin . So you are not guilty. ’ ”
NCV	Judges	21	23	So that is what the Benjaminites did . While the young women were dancing , each man caught one of them , took her away , and married her . Then they went back to the land God had given them and rebuilt their cities and lived there .
NCV	Judges	21	24	Then the Israelites went home to their own tribes and family groups , to their own land that God had given them .

NCV	Ruth	1	1	Long ago when the judges [ a ] ruled Israel , there was a shortage of food in the land .
NCV	Ruth	1	2	So a man named Elimelech left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to live in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons . His wife was named Naomi , and his two sons were named Mahlon and Kilion . They were Ephrathahites from Bethlehem in Judah . When they came to Moab , they settled there .
NCV	Ruth	1	3	Then Naomi ’ s husband , Elimelech , died , and she was left with her two sons .
NCV	Ruth	1	4	These sons married women from Moab . One was named Orpah , and the other was named Ruth . Naomi and her sons had lived in Moab about ten years
NCV	Ruth	1	5	when Mahlon and Kilion also died . So Naomi was left alone without her husband or her two sons .
NCV	Ruth	1	6	While Naomi was in Moab , she heard that the Lord had come to help his people and had given them food again . So she and her daughters-in-law got ready to leave Moab and return home .
NCV	Ruth	1	7	Naomi and her daughters-in-law left the place where they had lived and started back to the land of Judah .
NCV	Ruth	1	8	But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , “ Go back home , each of you to your own mother ’ s house . May the Lord be as kind to you as you have been to me and my sons who are now dead .
NCV	Ruth	1	9	May the Lord give you another happy home and a new husband. ” When Naomi kissed the women good-bye , they began to cry out loud .
NCV	Ruth	1	10	They said to her , “ No , we want to go with you to your people. ”
NCV	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said , “ My daughters , return to your own homes . Why do you want to go with me ? I can not give birth to more sons to give you new husbands ;
NCV	Ruth	1	12	go back , my daughters , to your own homes . I am too old to have another husband . Even if I told myself , ‘ I still have hope ’ and had another husband tonight , and even if I had more sons ,
NCV	Ruth	1	13	should you wait until they were grown into men ? Should you live for so many years without husbands ? Don ’ t do that , my daughters . My life is much too sad for you to share , because the Lord has been against me ! ”
NCV	Ruth	1	14	The women cried together out loud again . Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law Naomi good-bye , but Ruth held on to her tightly .
NCV	Ruth	1	15	Naomi said to Ruth , “ Look , your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and her own gods . Go back with her. ” Ruth Stays with Naomi
NCV	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth said , “ Don ’ t beg me to leave you or to stop following you . Where you go , I will go . Where you live , I will live . Your people will be my people , and your God will be my God .
NCV	Ruth	1	17	And where you die , I will die , and there I will be buried . I ask the Lord to punish me terribly if I do not keep this promise : Not even death will separate us. ”
NCV	Ruth	1	18	When Naomi saw that Ruth had firmly made up her mind to go with her , she stopped arguing with her .
NCV	Ruth	1	19	So Naomi and Ruth went on until they came to the town of Bethlehem . When they entered Bethlehem , all the people became very excited . The women of the town said , “ Is this really Naomi ? ”
NCV	Ruth	1	20	Naomi answered the people , “ Don ’ t call me Naomi . [ b ] Call me Mara , [ c ] because the Almighty has made my life very sad .
NCV	Ruth	1	21	When I left , I had all I wanted , but now , the Lord has brought me home with nothing . Why should you call me Naomi when the Lord has spoken against me and the Almighty has given me so much trouble ? ”

NCV	Ruth	2	2	One day Ruth , the Moabite , said to Naomi , “ I am going to the fields . Maybe someone will be kind enough to let me gather the grain he leaves behind. ” Naomi said , “ Go , my daughter. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	3	So Ruth went to the fields and gathered the grain that the workers cutting the grain had left behind . It just so happened that the field belonged to Boaz , from Elimelech ’ s family .
NCV	Ruth	2	4	Soon Boaz came from Bethlehem and greeted his workers , “ The Lord be with you ! ” And the workers answered , “ May the Lord bless you ! ”
NCV	Ruth	2	5	Then Boaz asked his servant in charge of the workers , “ Whose girl is that ? ”
NCV	Ruth	2	6	The servant answered , “ She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab .
NCV	Ruth	2	7	She said , ‘ Please let me follow the workers cutting grain and gather what they leave behind. ’ She came and has remained here , from morning until just now . She has stopped only a few moments to rest in the shelter. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth , “ Listen , my daughter . Don ’ t go to gather grain for yourself in another field . Don ’ t even leave this field at all , but continue following closely behind my women workers .
NCV	Ruth	2	9	Watch to see into which fields they go to cut grain and follow them . I have warned the young men not to bother you . When you are thirsty , you may go and drink from the water jugs that the young men have filled. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	10	Then Ruth bowed low with her face to the ground and said to him , “ I am not an Israelite . Why have you been so kind to notice me ? ”
NCV	Ruth	2	11	Boaz answered her , “ I know about all the help you have given your mother-in-law after your husband died . You left your father and mother and your own country to come to a nation where you did not know anyone .
NCV	Ruth	2	12	May the Lord reward you for all you have done . May your wages be paid in full by the Lord , the God of Israel , under whose wings you have come for shelter. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	13	Then Ruth said , “ I hope I can continue to please you , sir . You have said kind and encouraging words to me , your servant , though I am not one of your servants. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz told Ruth , “ Come here . Eat some of our bread and dip it in our sauce. ” So Ruth sat down beside the workers . Boaz handed her some roasted grain , and she ate until she was full ; she even had some food left over .
NCV	Ruth	2	15	When Ruth rose and went back to work , Boaz commanded his workers , “ Let her gather even around the piles of cut grain . Don ’ t tell her to go away .
NCV	Ruth	2	16	In fact , drop some full heads of grain for her from what you have in your hands , and let her gather them . Don ’ t tell her to stop. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	17	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening . Then she separated the grain from the chaff , and there was about one-half bushel of barley .
NCV	Ruth	2	18	Ruth carried the grain into town , and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered . Ruth also took out the food that was left over from lunch and gave it to Naomi .
NCV	Ruth	2	19	Naomi asked her , “ Where did you gather all this grain today ? Where did you work ? Blessed be whoever noticed you ! ” Ruth told her mother-in-law whose field she had worked in . She said , “ The man I worked with today is named Boaz. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	20	Naomi told her daughter-in-law , “ The Lord bless him ! He continues to be kind to us—both the living and the dead ! ” Then Naomi told Ruth , “ Boaz is one of our close relatives , [ a ] one who should take care of us. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	21	Then Ruth , the Moabite , said , “ Boaz also told me , ‘ Keep close to my workers until they have finished my whole harvest. ’ ”
NCV	Ruth	2	22	But Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth , “ It is better for you to continue working with his women workers . If you work in another field , someone might hurt you. ”
NCV	Ruth	2	23	So Ruth continued working closely with the workers of Boaz , gathering grain until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished . And she continued to live with Naomi , her mother-in-law . Footnotes - 2:20 close relatives In Bible times the closest relative could marry a widow without children so she could have children .

NCV	Ruth	3	3	Wash yourself , put on perfume , change your clothes , and go down to the threshing floor . But don ’ t let him know you ’ re there until he has finished his dinner .
NCV	Ruth	3	2	Now Boaz , whose young women you worked with , is our close relative . [ a ] Tonight he will be working at the threshing floor .
NCV	Ruth	3	4	Watch him so you will know where he lies down to sleep . When he lies down , go and lift the cover off his feet [ b ] and lie down . He will tell you what you should do. ”
NCV	Ruth	3	5	Then Ruth answered , “ I will do everything you say. ”
NCV	Ruth	3	6	So Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did all her mother-in-law told her to do .
NCV	Ruth	3	7	After his evening meal , Boaz felt good and went to sleep lying beside the pile of grain . Ruth went to him quietly and lifted the cover from his feet and lay down .
NCV	Ruth	3	8	About midnight Boaz was startled and rolled over . There was a woman lying near his feet !
NCV	Ruth	3	9	Boaz asked , “ Who are you ? ” She said , “ I am Ruth , your servant girl . Spread your cover over me , because you are a relative who is supposed to take care of me. ” [ c ]
NCV	Ruth	3	10	Then Boaz said , “ The Lord bless you , my daughter . This act of kindness is greater than the kindness you showed to Naomi in the beginning . You didn ’ t look for a young man to marry , either rich or poor .
NCV	Ruth	3	11	Now , my daughter , don ’ t be afraid . I will do everything you ask , because all the people in our town know you are a good woman .
NCV	Ruth	3	12	It is true that I am a relative who is to take care of you , but you have a closer relative than I .
NCV	Ruth	3	13	Stay here tonight , and in the morning we will see if he will take care of you . If he decides to take care of you , that is fine . But if he refuses , I will take care of you myself , as surely as the Lord lives . So stay here until morning. ”
NCV	Ruth	3	14	So Ruth stayed near his feet until morning but got up while it was still too dark to recognize anyone . Boaz thought , “ People in town must not know that the woman came here to the threshing floor. ”
NCV	Ruth	3	15	So Boaz said to Ruth , “ Bring me your shawl and hold it open. ” So Ruth held her shawl open , and Boaz poured six portions of barley into it . Boaz then put it on her head and went back to the city .
NCV	Ruth	3	16	When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law , Naomi asked , “ How did you do , my daughter ? ” Ruth told Naomi everything that Boaz did for her .
NCV	Ruth	3	17	She said , “ Boaz gave me these six portions of barley , saying , ‘ You must not go home without a gift for your mother-in-law. ’ ”

NCV	Ruth	4	4	So I decided to tell you about it : If you want to buy back the land , then buy it in front of the people who are sitting here and in front of the elders of my people . But if you don ’ t want to buy it , tell me , because you are the only one who can buy it , and I am next after you. ” The close relative answered , “ I will buy back the land. ”
NCV	Ruth	4	2	Boaz gathered ten of the elders of the city and told them , “ Sit down here ! ” So they sat down .
NCV	Ruth	4	3	Then Boaz said to the close relative , “ Naomi , who has come back from the country of Moab , wants to sell the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech .
NCV	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz explained , “ When you buy the land from Naomi , you must also marry Ruth , the Moabite , the dead man ’ s wife . That way , the land will stay in the dead man ’ s name. ”
NCV	Ruth	4	6	The close relative answered , “ I can ’ t buy back the land . If I did , I might harm what I can pass on to my own sons . I can not buy the land back , so buy it yourself. ”
NCV	Ruth	4	7	Long ago in Israel when people traded or bought back something , one person took off his sandal and gave it to the other person . This was the proof of ownership in Israel .
NCV	Ruth	4	8	So the close relative said to Boaz , “ Buy the land yourself , ” and he took off his sandal .
NCV	Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people , “ You are witnesses today . I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech and Kilion and Mahlon .
NCV	Ruth	4	10	I am also taking Ruth , the Moabite who was the wife of Mahlon , as my wife . I am doing this so her dead husband ’ s property will stay in his name and his name will not be separated from his family and his hometown . You are witnesses today. ”
NCV	Ruth	4	11	So all the people and elders who were at the city gate said , “ We are witnesses . May the Lord make this woman , who is coming into your home , like Rachel and Leah , who had many children and built up the people of Israel . May you become powerful in the district of Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem .
NCV	Ruth	4	12	As Tamar gave birth to Judah ’ s son Perez , [ a ] may the Lord give you many children through Ruth . May your family be great like his. ”
NCV	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth home as his wife and had sexual relations with her . The Lord let her become pregnant , and she gave birth to a son .
NCV	Ruth	4	14	The women told Naomi , “ Praise the Lord who gave you this grandson . May he become famous in Israel .
NCV	Ruth	4	15	He will give you new life and will take care of you in your old age because of your daughter-in-law who loves you . She is better for you than seven sons , because she has given birth to your grandson. ”
NCV	Ruth	4	16	Naomi took the boy , held him in her arms , and cared for him .
NCV	Ruth	4	17	The neighbors gave the boy his name , saying , “ This boy was born for Naomi. ” They named him Obed . Obed was the father of Jesse , and Jesse was the father of David .

NCV	1%20Samuel	1	1	There was a man named Elkanah son of Jeroham from Ramathaim in the mountains of Ephraim . Elkanah was from the family of Zuph . ( Jeroham was Elihu ’ s son . Elihu was Tohu ’ s son , and Tohu was the son of Zuph from the family group of Ephraim . )
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	2	Elkanah had two wives named Hannah and Peninnah . Peninnah had children , but Hannah had none .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	3	Every year Elkanah left his town of Ramah and went up to Shiloh to worship the Lord All-Powerful and to offer sacrifices to him . Shiloh was where Hophni and Phinehas , the sons of Eli , served as priests of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	4	When Elkanah offered sacrifices , he always gave a share of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to her sons and daughters .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	5	But Elkanah always gave a special share of the meat to Hannah , because he loved Hannah and because the Lord had kept her from having children .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	6	Peninnah would tease Hannah and upset her , because the Lord had made her unable to have children .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	7	This happened every year when they went up to the house of the Lord at Shiloh . Peninnah would upset Hannah until Hannah would cry and not eat anything .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	8	Her husband Elkanah would say to her , “ Hannah , why are you crying and why won ’ t you eat ? Why are you sad ? Don ’ t I mean more to you than ten sons ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	9	Once , after they had eaten their meal in Shiloh , Hannah got up . Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair near the entrance to the Lord ’ s house .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	10	Hannah was so sad that she cried and prayed to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	11	She made a promise , saying , “ Lord All-Powerful , see how sad I am . Remember me and don ’ t forget me . If you will give me a son , I will give him back to you all his life , and no one will ever cut his hair with a razor. ” [ a ]
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	12	While Hannah kept praying , Eli watched her mouth .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	13	She was praying in her heart so her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . Eli thought she was drunk
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	14	and said to her , “ Stop getting drunk ! Throw away your wine ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	15	Hannah answered , “ No , sir , I have not drunk any wine or beer . I am a deeply troubled woman , and I was telling the Lord about all my problems .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	16	Don ’ t think I am an evil woman . I have been praying because I have many troubles and am very sad. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	17	Eli answered , “ Go ! I wish you well . May the God of Israel give you what you asked of him. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	18	Hannah said , “ May I always please you. ” When she left and ate something , she was not sad anymore .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	19	Early the next morning Elkanah ’ s family got up and worshiped the Lord . Then they went back home to Ramah . Elkanah had sexual relations with his wife Hannah , and the Lord remembered her .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	20	So Hannah became pregnant , and in time she gave birth to a son . She named him Samuel , [ b ] saying , “ His name is Samuel because I asked the Lord for him. ” Hannah Gives Samuel to God
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	21	Every year Elkanah went with his whole family to Shiloh to offer sacrifices and to keep the promise he had made to God .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	22	But one time Hannah did not go with him . She told him , “ When the boy is old enough to eat solid food , I will take him to Shiloh . Then I will give him to the Lord , and he will always live there. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	23	Elkanah , Hannah ’ s husband , said to her , “ Do what you think is best . You may stay home until the boy is old enough to eat . May the Lord do what you have said. ” So Hannah stayed at home to nurse her son until he was old enough to eat .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	24	When Samuel was old enough to eat , Hannah took him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh , along with a three-year-old bull , one-half bushel of flour , and a leather bag filled with wine .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	25	After they had killed the bull for the sacrifice , Hannah brought Samuel to Eli .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	26	She said to Eli , “ As surely as you live , sir , I am the same woman who stood near you praying to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	27	I prayed for this child , and the Lord answered my prayer and gave him to me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	1	28	Now I give him back to the Lord . He will belong to the Lord all his life. ” And he worshiped the Lord there .

NCV	1%20Samuel	2	2	“ There is no one holy like the Lord . There is no God but you ; there is no Rock like our God .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	3	“ Don ’ t continue bragging , don ’ t speak proud words . The Lord is a God who knows everything , and he judges what people do .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	4	“ The bows of warriors break , but weak people become strong .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	5	Those who once had plenty of food now must work for food , but people who were hungry are hungry no more . The woman who could not have children now has seven , but the woman who had many children now is sad .

NCV	1%20Samuel	2	7	The Lord makes some people poor , and others he makes rich . He makes some people humble , and others he makes great .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	8	The Lord raises the poor up from the dust , and he lifts the needy from the ashes . He lets the poor sit with princes and receive a throne of honor . “ The foundations of the earth belong to the Lord , and the Lord set the world upon them .

NCV	1%20Samuel	2	11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah , but the boy continued to serve the Lord under Eli the priest .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now Eli ’ s sons were evil men ; they did not care about the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	13	This is what the priests would normally do to the people : Every time someone brought a sacrifice , the meat would be cooked in a pot . The priest ’ s servant would then come carrying a fork that had three prongs .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	14	He would plunge the fork into the pot or the kettle . Whatever the fork brought out of the pot belonged to the priest . But this is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	15	Even before the fat was burned , the priest ’ s servant would come to the person offering sacrifices and say , “ Give the priest some meat to roast . He won ’ t accept boiled meat from you , only raw meat. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	16	If the one who offered the sacrifice said , “ Let the fat be burned up first as usual , and then take anything you want , ” the priest ’ s servant would answer , “ No , give me the meat now . If you don ’ t , I ’ ll take it by force. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	17	The Lord saw that the sin of the servants was very great because they did not show respect for the offerings made to the Lord . Samuel Grows Up
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	18	But Samuel obeyed the Lord . As a boy he wore a linen holy vest .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	19	Every year Samuel ’ s mother made a little coat for him and took it to him when she went with her husband to Shiloh for the sacrifice .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	20	When Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , he would say , “ May the Lord repay you with children through Hannah to take the place of the boy Hannah prayed for and gave back to the Lord. ” Then Elkanah and Hannah would go home .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	21	The Lord was kind to Hannah , so she became the mother of three sons and two daughters . And the boy Samuel grew up serving the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	22	Now Eli was very old . He heard about everything his sons were doing to all the Israelites and how his sons had sexual relations with the women who served at the entrance to the Meeting Tent .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	23	Eli said to his sons , “ Why do you do these evil things that the people tell me about ?
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons . The Lord ’ s people are spreading a bad report about you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	25	If you sin against someone , God can help you . But if you sin against the Lord himself , no one can help you ! ” But Eli ’ s sons would not listen to him , because the Lord had decided to put them to death .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	26	The boy Samuel grew physically . He pleased the Lord and the people .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	27	A man of God came to Eli and said , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ I clearly showed myself to the family of your ancestor Aaron when they were slaves to the king of Egypt .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	28	I chose them from all the tribes of Israel to be my priests . I wanted them to go up to my altar , to burn incense , and to wear the holy vest . I also let the family of your ancestor have part of all the offerings sacrificed by the Israelites .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	29	So why don ’ t you respect the sacrifices and gifts ? You honor your sons more than me . You grow fat on the best parts of the meat the Israelites bring to me. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	30	“ So the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I promised that your family and your ancestor ’ s family would serve me always. ’ But now the Lord says : ‘ This must stop ! I will honor those who honor me , but I will dishonor those who ignore me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	2	31	The time is coming when I will destroy the descendants of both you and your ancestors . No man will grow old in your family .

NCV	1%20Samuel	3	10	The Lord came and stood there and called as he had before , “ Samuel , Samuel ! ” Samuel said , “ Speak , Lord . I am your servant and I am listening. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	3	11	The Lord said to Samuel , “ Watch , I am going to do something in Israel that will shock those who hear about it .

NCV	1%20Samuel	4	5	When the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord came into the camp , all the Israelites gave a great shout of joy that made the ground shake .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	6	When the Philistines heard Israel ’ s shout , they asked , “ What ’ s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp ? ” Then the Philistines found out that the Ark of the Lord had come into the Hebrew camp .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	7	They were afraid and said , “ A god has come into the Hebrew camp ! We ’ re in trouble ! This has never happened before !
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	8	How terrible it will be for us ! Who can save us from these powerful gods ? They are the ones who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of disasters in the desert .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	9	Be brave , Philistines ! Fight like men ! In the past they were our slaves . So fight like men , or we will become their slaves. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	10	So the Philistines fought hard and defeated the Israelites , and every Israelite soldier ran away to his own home . It was a great defeat for Israel , because thirty thousand Israelite soldiers were killed .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	11	The Ark of God was taken by the Philistines , and Eli ’ s two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , died .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	12	That same day a man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battle . He tore his clothes and put dust on his head to show his great sadness .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	13	When he arrived in Shiloh , Eli was by the side of the road . He was sitting there in a chair , watching , because he was worried about the Ark of God . When the Benjaminite entered Shiloh , he told the bad news . Then all the people in town cried loudly .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	14	Eli heard the crying and asked , “ What ’ s all this noise ? ” The Benjaminite ran to Eli and told him what had happened .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	15	Eli was now ninety-eight years old , and he was blind .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	16	The Benjaminite told him , “ I have come from the battle . I ran all the way here today. ” Eli asked , “ What happened , my son ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	17	The Benjaminite answered , “ Israel ran away from the Philistines , and the Israelite army has lost many soldiers . Your two sons are both dead , and the Philistines have taken the Ark of God. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	18	When he mentioned the Ark of God , Eli fell backward off his chair . He fell beside the gate , broke his neck , and died , because he was old and fat . He had led Israel for forty years . The Glory Is Gone
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	19	Eli ’ s daughter-in-law , the wife of Phinehas , was pregnant and was about to give birth . When she heard the news that the Ark of God had been taken and that Eli , her father-in-law , and Phinehas , her husband , were both dead , she began to give birth to her child . The child was born , but the mother had much trouble in giving birth .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	20	As she was dying , the women who helped her said , “ Don ’ t worry ! You ’ ve given birth to a son ! ” But she did not answer or pay attention .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	21	She named the baby Ichabod , [ a ] saying , “ Israel ’ s glory is gone. ” She said this because the Ark of God had been taken and her father-in-law and husband were dead .
NCV	1%20Samuel	4	22	She said , “ Israel ’ s glory is gone , because the Ark of God has been taken away. ” Footnotes - 4:21 Ichabod This name means “ no glory. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	5	5	So , even today , Dagon ’ s priests and others who enter his temple at Ashdod refuse to step on the doorsill .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	2	They carried it into Dagon ’ s temple and put it next to Dagon .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	3	When the people of Ashdod rose early the next morning , they found that Dagon had fallen on his face on the ground before the Ark of the Lord . So they put Dagon back in his place .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	4	The next morning when they rose , they again found Dagon fallen on the ground before the Ark of the Lord . His head and hands had broken off and were lying in the doorway . Only his body was still in one piece .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	6	The Lord was hard on the people of Ashdod and their neighbors . He caused them to suffer and gave them growths on their skin .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	7	When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening , they said , “ The Ark of the God of Israel can ’ t stay with us . God is punishing us and Dagon our god. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	8	The people of Ashdod called all five Philistine kings together and asked them , “ What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel ? ” The rulers answered , “ Move the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath. ” So the Philistines moved it to Gath .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	9	But after they moved it to Gath , there was a great panic . The Lord was hard on that city also , and he gave both old and young people in Gath growths on their skin .
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	10	Then the Philistines sent the Ark of God to Ekron . But when it came into Ekron , the people of Ekron yelled , “ Why are you bringing the Ark of the God of Israel to our city ? Do you want to kill us and our people ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they called all the kings of the Philistines together and said , “ Send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its place before it kills us and our people ! ” All the people in the city were struck with terror because God was so hard on them there .

NCV	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	6	Don ’ t be stubborn like the king of Egypt and the Egyptians . After God punished them terribly , they let the Israelites leave Egypt .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	2	Then they called for their priests and magicians and said , “ What should we do with the Ark of the Lord ? Tell us how to send it back home ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	3	The priests and magicians answered , “ If you send back the Ark of the God of Israel , don ’ t send it back empty . You must give a penalty offering . If you are then healed , you will know that it was because of the Ark that you had such trouble. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	4	The Philistines asked , “ What kind of penalty offering should we send to Israel ’ s God ? ” They answered , “ Make five gold models of the growths on your skin and five gold models of rats . The number of models must match the number of Philistine kings , because the same sickness has come on you and your kings .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	5	Make models of the growths and the rats that are ruining the country , and give honor to Israel ’ s God . Then maybe he will stop being so hard on you , your gods , and your land .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	7	“ You must build a new cart and get two cows that have just had calves . These must be cows that have never had yokes on their necks . Hitch the cows to the cart , and take the calves home , away from their mothers .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	8	Put the Ark of the Lord on the cart and the gold models for the penalty offering in a box beside the Ark . Then send the cart straight on its way .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	9	Watch the cart . If it goes toward Beth Shemesh in Israel ’ s own land , the Lord has given us this great sickness . But if it doesn ’ t , we will know that Israel ’ s God has not punished us . Our sickness just happened by chance. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	10	The Philistines did what the priests and magicians said . They took two cows that had just had calves and hitched them to the cart , but they kept their calves at home .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	11	They put the Ark of the Lord and the box with the gold rats and models of growths on the cart .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	12	Then the cows went straight toward Beth Shemesh . They stayed on the road , mooing all the way , and did not turn right or left . The Philistine kings followed the cows as far as the border of Beth Shemesh .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	13	Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley . When they looked up and saw the Ark of the Lord , they were very happy .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart came to the field belonging to Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped near a large rock . The people of Beth Shemesh chopped up the wood of the cart . Then they sacrificed the cows as burnt offerings to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	15	The Levites took down the Ark of the Lord and the box that had the gold models , and they put both on the large rock . That day the people of Beth Shemesh offered whole burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	16	After the five Philistine kings saw this , they went back to Ekron the same day .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	17	The Philistines had sent these gold models of the growths as penalty offerings to the Lord . They sent one model for each Philistine town : Ashdod , Gaza , Ashkelon , Gath , and Ekron .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	18	And the Philistines also sent gold models of rats . The number of rats matched the number of towns belonging to the Philistine kings , including both strong , walled cities and country villages . The large rock on which they put the Ark of the Lord is still there in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	19	But some of the men of Beth Shemesh looked into the Ark of the Lord . So God killed seventy of them . The people of Beth Shemesh cried because the Lord had struck them down .
NCV	1%20Samuel	6	20	They said , “ Who can stand before the Lord , this holy God ? Whom will he strike next ? ”

NCV	1%20Samuel	7	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	7	The Philistines heard the Israelites were meeting at Mizpah , so the Philistine kings came up to attack them . When the Israelites heard they were coming , they were afraid .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	2	The Ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all . And the people of Israel began to follow the Lord again .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	3	Samuel spoke to the whole group of Israel , saying , “ If you ’ re turning back to the Lord with all your hearts , you must remove your foreign gods and your idols of Ashtoreth . You must give yourselves fully to the Lord and serve only him . Then he will save you from the Philistines. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	4	So the Israelites put away their idols of Baal and Ashtoreth , and they served only the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	5	Samuel said , “ All Israel must meet at Mizpah , and I will pray to the Lord for you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	6	So the Israelites met together at Mizpah . They drew water from the ground and poured it out before the Lord and fasted that day . They confessed , “ We have sinned against the Lord. ” And Samuel served as judge of Israel at Mizpah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	8	They said to Samuel , “ Don ’ t stop praying to the Lord our God for us ! Ask him to save us from the Philistines ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	9	Then Samuel took a baby lamb and offered it to the Lord as a whole burnt offering . He called to the Lord for Israel ’ s sake , and the Lord answered him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	10	While Samuel was burning the offering , the Philistines came near to attack Israel . But the Lord thundered against them with loud thunder . They were so frightened they became confused . So the Israelites defeated the Philistines in battle .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	11	The men of Israel ran out of Mizpah and chased the Philistines almost to Beth Car , killing the Philistines along the way . Peace Comes to Israel
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	12	After this happened Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen . He named the stone Ebenezer , [ a ] saying , “ The Lord has helped us to this point. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were defeated and did not enter the Israelites ’ land again . The Lord was against the Philistines all Samuel ’ s life .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	14	Earlier the Philistines had taken towns from the Israelites , but the Israelites won them back , from Ekron to Gath . They also took back from the Philistines the lands near these towns . There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	15	Samuel continued as judge of Israel all his life .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	16	Every year he went from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah and judged the Israelites in all these towns .
NCV	1%20Samuel	7	17	But Samuel always went back to Ramah , where his home was . There he judged Israel and built an altar to the Lord . Footnotes - 7:12 Ebenezer This name means “ stone of help. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	8	They are doing as they have always done . When I took them out of Egypt , they left me and served other gods . They are doing the same to you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	2	His first son was named Joel , and his second son was named Abijah . Joel and Abijah were judges in Beersheba .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	3	But Samuel ’ s sons did not live as he did . They tried to get money dishonestly , and they accepted money secretly to make wrong judgments .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	4	So all the elders came together and met Samuel at Ramah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	5	They said to him , “ You ’ re old , and your sons don ’ t live as you do . Give us a king to rule over us like all the other nations. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	6	When the elders said that , Samuel was not pleased . He prayed to the Lord ,
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	7	and the Lord told Samuel , “ Listen to whatever the people say to you . They have not rejected you . They have rejected me from being their king .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	9	Now listen to the people , but warn them what the king who rules over them will do. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	10	So Samuel told those who had asked him for a king what the Lord had said .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	11	Samuel said , “ If you have a king ruling over you , this is what he will do : He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and his horses , and they will run in front of the king ’ s chariot .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	12	The king will make some of your sons commanders over thousands or over fifties . He will make some of your other sons plow his ground and reap his harvest . He will take others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	13	He will take your daughters to make perfume and cook and bake for him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	14	He will take your best fields , vineyards , and olive groves and give them to his servants .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will take one-tenth of your grain and grapes and give it to his officers and servants .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	16	He will take your male and female servants , your best cattle , and your donkeys and use them all for his own work .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take one-tenth of your flocks , and you yourselves will become his slaves .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	18	When that time comes , you will cry out because of the king you chose . But the Lord will not answer you then. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	19	But the people would not listen to Samuel . They said , “ No ! We want a king to rule over us .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	20	Then we will be the same as all the other nations . Our king will judge for us and go with us and fight our battles. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	21	After Samuel heard all that the people said , he repeated their words to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	8	22	The Lord answered , “ You must listen to them . Give them a king. ” Then Samuel told the people of Israel , “ Go back to your towns. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	9	9	( In the past , if someone in Israel wanted to ask something from God , he would say , “ Let ’ s go to the seer. ” We call the person a prophet today , but in the past he was called a seer . )
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	2	Kish had a son named Saul , who was a fine young man . There was no Israelite better than he . Saul stood a head taller than any other man in Israel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	3	Now the donkeys of Saul ’ s father , Kish , were lost . So Kish said to Saul , his son , “ Take one of the servants , and go and look for the donkeys. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	4	Saul went through the mountains of Ephraim and the land of Shalisha , but he and the servant could not find the donkeys . They went into the land of Shaalim , but the donkeys were not there . They went through the land of Benjamin , but they still did not find them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	5	When they arrived in the area of Zuph , Saul said to his servant , “ Let ’ s go back or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and will start worrying about us. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	6	But the servant answered , “ A man of God is in this town . People respect him because everything he says comes true . Let ’ s go into the town now . Maybe he can tell us something about the journey we have taken. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	7	Saul said to his servant , “ If we go into the town , what can we give him ? The food in our bags is gone . We have no gift to give him . Do we have anything ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	8	Again the servant answered Saul . “ Look , I have one-tenth of an ounce of silver . Give it to the man of God . Then he will tell us about our journey. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	10	Saul said to his servant , “ That ’ s a good idea . Come , let ’ s go. ” So they went toward the town where the man of God was .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	11	As Saul and the servant were going up the hill to the town , they met some young women coming out to get water . Saul and the servant asked them , “ Is the seer here ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	12	The young women answered , “ Yes , he ’ s here . He ’ s ahead of you . Hurry now . He has just come to our town today , because the people will offer a sacrifice at the place of worship .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	13	As soon as you enter the town , you will find him before he goes up to the place of worship to eat . The people will not begin eating until the seer comes , because he must bless the sacrifice . After that , the guests will eat . Go now , and you should find him. ” Saul Meets Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	14	Saul and the servant went up to the town . Just as they entered it , they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the place of worship .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	15	The day before Saul came , the Lord had told Samuel :
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin . Appoint him to lead my people Israel . He will save my people from the Philistines . I have seen the suffering of my people , and I have listened to their cry. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	17	When Samuel first saw Saul , the Lord said to Samuel , “ This is the man I told you about . He will organize my people. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	18	Saul approached Samuel at the gate and said , “ Please tell me where the seer ’ s house is. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	19	Samuel answered , “ I am the seer . Go with me to the place of worship . Today you and your servant are to eat with me . Tomorrow morning I will answer all your questions and send you home .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	20	Don ’ t worry about the donkeys you lost three days ago , because they have been found . Soon all the wealth of Israel will belong to you and your family. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	21	Saul answered , “ But I am from the tribe of Benjamin , the smallest tribe in Israel . And my family group is the smallest in the tribe of Benjamin . Why are you saying such things ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into a large room and gave them a choice place at the table . About thirty guests were there .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	23	Samuel said to the cook , “ Bring the meat I gave you , the portion I told you to set aside. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the cook took the thigh and put it on the table in front of Saul . Samuel said , “ This is the meat saved for you . Eat it , because it was set aside for you for this special time . As I said , ‘ I had invited the people. ’ ” So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	25	After they finished eating , they came down from the place of worship and went to the town . Then Samuel talked with Saul on the roof [ a ] of his house .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	26	At dawn they got up , and Samuel called to Saul on the roof . He said , “ Get up , and I will send you on your way. ” So Saul got up and went out of the house with Samuel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	9	27	As Saul , his servant , and Samuel were getting near the edge of the city , Samuel said to Saul , “ Tell the servant to go on ahead of us , but you stay , because I have a message from God for you. ” Footnotes - 9:25 roof In Bible times houses were built with flat roofs .

NCV	1%20Samuel	10	10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah , Saul met a group of prophets . The Spirit of God rushed upon him , and he prophesied with the prophets .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	2	After you leave me today , you will meet two men near Rachel ’ s tomb on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah . They will say to you , ‘ The donkeys you were looking for have been found . But now your father has stopped thinking about his donkeys and is worrying about you . He is asking , “ What will I do about my son ? ” ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	3	“ Then you will go on until you reach the big tree at Tabor . Three men on their way to worship God at Bethel will meet you there . One man will be carrying three goats . Another will be carrying three loaves of bread . And the third will have a leather bag full of wine .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	4	They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread , which you must accept .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	5	Then you will go to Gibeah of God , where a Philistine camp is . When you approach this town , a group of prophets will come down from the place of worship . They will be playing harps , tambourines , flutes , and lyres , and they will be prophesying .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	6	Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you with power . You will prophesy with these prophets , and you will be changed into a different man .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	7	After these signs happen , do whatever you find to do , because God will help you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	8	“ Go ahead of me to Gilgal . I will come down to you to offer whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . But you must wait seven days . Then I will come and tell you what to do. ” Saul Made King
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	9	When Saul turned to leave Samuel , God changed Saul ’ s heart . All these signs came true that day .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	11	When people who had known Saul before saw him prophesying with the prophets , they asked each other , “ What has happened to Kish ’ s son ? Is even Saul one of the prophets ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	12	A man who lived there said , “ Who is the father of these prophets ? ” So this became a famous saying : “ Is even Saul one of the prophets ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	13	When Saul finished prophesying , he entered the place of worship .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	14	Saul ’ s uncle asked him and his servant , “ Where have you been ? ” Saul said , “ We were looking for the donkeys . When we couldn ’ t find them , we went to talk to Samuel. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	15	Saul ’ s uncle asked , “ Please tell me . What did Samuel say to you ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	16	Saul answered , “ He told us the donkeys had already been found. ” But Saul did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about his becoming king .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	17	Samuel called all the people of Israel to meet with the Lord at Mizpah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	18	He said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I led Israel out of Egypt . I saved you from Egypt ’ s control and from other kingdoms that were troubling you. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	19	But now you have rejected your God . He saves you from all your troubles and problems , but you said , ‘ No ! We want a king to rule over us. ’ Now come , stand before the Lord in your tribes and family groups. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	20	When Samuel gathered all the tribes of Israel , the tribe of Benjamin was picked .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	21	Samuel had them pass by in family groups , and Matri ’ s family was picked . Then he had each man of Matri ’ s family pass by , and Saul son of Kish was picked . But when they looked for Saul , they could not find him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	22	They asked the Lord , “ Has Saul come here yet ? ” The Lord said , “ Yes . He ’ s hiding behind the baggage. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	23	So they ran and brought him out . When Saul stood among the people , he was a head taller than anyone else .
NCV	1%20Samuel	10	24	Then Samuel said to the people , “ See the man the Lord has chosen . There is no one like him among all the people. ” Then the people shouted , “ Long live the king ! ”

NCV	1%20Samuel	11	3	The elders of Jabesh said to Nahash , “ Give us seven days to send messengers through all Israel . If no one comes to help us , we will give ourselves up to you. ”

NCV	1%20Samuel	11	5	Saul was coming home from plowing the fields with his oxen when he heard the people crying . He asked , “ What ’ s wrong with the people that they are crying ? ” Then they told Saul what the messengers from Jabesh had said .

NCV	1%20Samuel	11	7	So he took a pair of oxen and cut them into pieces . Then he gave the pieces of the oxen to messengers and ordered them to carry them through all the land of Israel . The messengers said , “ This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel. ” So the people became very afraid of the Lord . They all came together as if they were one person .
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	8	Saul gathered the people together at Bezek . There were three hundred thousand men from Israel and thirty thousand men from Judah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	9	They said to the messengers who had come , “ Tell the people at Jabesh Gilead this : ‘ Before the day warms up tomorrow , you will be saved. ’ ” So the messengers went and reported this to the people at Jabesh , and they were very happy .
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	10	The people said to Nahash the Ammonite , “ Tomorrow we will come out to meet you . Then you can do anything you want to us. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	12	Then the people said to Samuel , “ Who didn ’ t want Saul as king ? Bring them here and we will kill them ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Saul said , “ No ! No one will be put to death today . Today the Lord has saved Israel ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	14	Then Samuel said to the people , “ Come , let ’ s go to Gilgal . There we will again promise to obey the king. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	11	15	So all the people went to Gilgal , and there , before the Lord , the people made Saul king . They offered fellowship offerings to the Lord , and Saul and all the Israelites had a great celebration . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	12	But when you saw Nahash king of the Ammonites coming against you , you said , ‘ No ! We want a king to rule over us ! ’ —even though the Lord your God was your king .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	2	Now you have a king to lead you . I am old and gray , and my sons are here with you . I have been your leader since I was young .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	3	Here I am . If I have done anything wrong , you must testify against me before the Lord and his appointed king . Did I steal anyone ’ s ox or donkey ? Did I hurt or cheat anyone ? Did I ever secretly accept money to pretend not to see something wrong ? If I did any of these things , I will make it right. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	4	The Israelites answered , “ You have not cheated us , or hurt us , or taken anything unfairly from anyone. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	5	Samuel said to them , “ The Lord is a witness to what you have said . His appointed king is also a witness today that you did not find anything wrong in me. ” “ He is our witness , ” they said .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	6	Then Samuel said to the people , “ It is the Lord who chose Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors out of Egypt .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	7	Now , stand there , and I will remind you of all the good things the Lord did for you and your ancestors .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	8	“ After Jacob entered Egypt , his descendants cried to the Lord for help . So the Lord sent Moses and Aaron , who took your ancestors out of Egypt and brought them to live in this place .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	9	“ But they forgot the Lord their God . So he handed them over as slaves to Sisera , the commander of the army of Hazor , and as slaves to the Philistines and the king of Moab . They all fought against your ancestors .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	10	Then your ancestors cried to the Lord and said , ‘ We have sinned . We have left the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths . But now save us from our enemies , and we will serve you. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	11	So the Lord sent Gideon , [ a ] Barak , Jephthah , and Samuel . He saved you from your enemies around you , and you lived in safety .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	13	Now here is the king you chose , the one you asked for . The Lord has put him over you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	14	You must honor the Lord and serve him . You must obey his word and not turn against his commands . Both you and the king ruling over you must follow the Lord your God . If you do , it will be well with you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	15	But if you don ’ t obey the Lord , and if you turn against his commands , he will be against you . He will do to you what he did to your ancestors .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	16	“ Now stand still and see the great thing the Lord will do before your eyes .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	17	It is now the time of the wheat harvest . [ b ] I will pray for the Lord to send thunder and rain . Then you will know what an evil thing you did against the Lord when you asked for a king. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	18	Then Samuel prayed to the Lord , and that same day the Lord sent thunder and rain . So the people were very afraid of the Lord and Samuel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	19	They said to Samuel , “ Pray to the Lord your God for us , your servants ! Don ’ t let us die ! We ’ ve added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	20	Samuel answered , “ Don ’ t be afraid . It ’ s true that you did wrong , but don ’ t turn away from the Lord . Serve the Lord with all your heart .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	21	Idols are of no use , so don ’ t worship them . They can ’ t help you or save you . They are useless !
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	22	For his own sake , the Lord won ’ t leave his people . Instead , he was pleased to make you his own people .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	23	I will surely not stop praying for you , because that would be sinning against the Lord . I will teach you what is good and right .
NCV	1%20Samuel	12	24	You must honor the Lord and truly serve him with all your heart . Remember the wonderful things he did for you !

NCV	1%20Samuel	13	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	13	Samuel said , “ You acted foolishly ! You haven ’ t obeyed the command of the Lord your God . If you had obeyed him , the Lord would have made your kingdom continue in Israel always ,
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	2	Saul chose three thousand men from Israel . Two thousand men stayed with him at Micmash in the mountains of Bethel , and one thousand men stayed with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin . Saul sent the other men in the army back home .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	3	Jonathan attacked the Philistine camp in Geba , and the other Philistines heard about it . Saul said , “ Let the Hebrews hear what happened. ” So he told the men to blow trumpets through all the land of Israel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	4	All the Israelites heard the news . The men said , “ Saul has defeated the Philistine camp . Now the Philistines will really hate us ! ” Then the Israelites were called to join Saul at Gilgal .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	5	The Philistines gathered to fight Israel with three thousand [ b ] chariots and six thousand men to ride in them . Their soldiers were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . The Philistines went and camped at Micmash , which is east of Beth Aven .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	6	When the Israelites saw that they were in trouble , they went to hide in caves and bushes , among the rocks , and in pits and wells .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	7	Some Hebrews even went across the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead . But Saul stayed at Gilgal , and all the men in his army were shaking with fear .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	8	Saul waited seven days , because Samuel had said he would meet him then . But Samuel did not come to Gilgal , and the soldiers began to leave .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	9	So Saul said , “ Bring me the whole burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. ” Then Saul offered the whole burnt offering .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	10	Just as he finished , Samuel arrived , and Saul went to greet him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	11	Samuel asked , “ What have you done ? ” Saul answered , “ I saw the soldiers leaving me , and you were not here when you said you would be . The Philistines were gathering at Micmash .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	12	Then I thought , ‘ The Philistines will come against me at Gilgal , and I haven ’ t asked for the Lord ’ s approval. ’ So I forced myself to offer the whole burnt offering. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	14	but now your kingdom will not continue . The Lord has looked for the kind of man he wants . He has appointed him to rule his people , because you haven ’ t obeyed his command. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	15	Then Samuel left Gilgal and went to Gibeah in Benjamin . Saul counted the men who were still with him , and there were about six hundred . Hard Times for Israel
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	16	Saul and his son Jonathan and the soldiers with him stayed in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . The Philistines made their camp at Micmash .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	17	Three groups went out from the Philistine camp to make raids . One group went on the Ophrah road in the land of Shual .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	18	The second group went on the Beth Horon road . The third group went on the border road that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the desert .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	19	The whole land of Israel had no blacksmith because the Philistines had said , “ The Hebrews might make swords and spears. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	20	So all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines to have their plows , hoes , axes , and sickles sharpened .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	21	The Philistine blacksmiths charged about one-fourth of an ounce of silver for sharpening plows and hoes . And they charged one-eighth of an ounce of silver for sharpening picks , axes , and the sticks used to guide oxen .
NCV	1%20Samuel	13	22	So when the battle came , the soldiers with Saul and Jonathan had no swords or spears . Only Saul and his son Jonathan had them . Israel Defeats the Philistines

NCV	1%20Samuel	14	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	14	In that first fight Jonathan and his officer killed about twenty Philistines over a half acre of ground .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	2	Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree at the threshing floor near Gibeah . He had about six hundred men with him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	3	One man was Ahijah who was wearing the holy vest . ( Ahijah was a son of Ichabod ’ s brother Ahitub . Ichabod was the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , the Lord ’ s priest in Shiloh . ) No one knew Jonathan had left .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	4	There was a steep slope on each side of the pass that Jonathan planned to go through to reach the Philistine camp . The cliff on one side was named Bozez , and the cliff on the other side was named Seneh .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	5	One cliff faced north toward Micmash . The other faced south toward Geba .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	6	Jonathan said to his officer who carried his armor , “ Come . Let ’ s go to the camp of those men who are not circumcised . Maybe the Lord will help us . The Lord can give us victory if we have many people , or just a few. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	7	The officer who carried Jonathan ’ s armor said to him , “ Do whatever you think is best . Go ahead . I ’ m with you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	8	Jonathan said , “ Then come . We will cross over to the Philistines and let them see us .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say to us , ‘ Stay there until we come to you , ’ we will stay where we are . We won ’ t go up to them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if they say , ‘ Come up to us , ’ we will climb up , and the Lord will let us defeat them . This will be the sign for us. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	11	When both Jonathan and his officer let the Philistines see them , the Philistines said , “ Look ! The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	12	The Philistines in the camp shouted to Jonathan and his officer , “ Come up to us . We ’ ll teach you a lesson ! ” Jonathan said to his officer , “ Climb up behind me , because the Lord has given the Philistines to Israel ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	13	So Jonathan climbed up , using his hands and feet , and his officer climbed just behind him . Jonathan struck down the Philistines as he went , and his officer killed them as he followed behind him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	15	All the Philistine soldiers panicked—those in the camp and those in the raiding party . The ground itself shook ! God had caused the panic .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	16	Saul ’ s guards were at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin when they saw the Philistine soldiers running in every direction .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	17	Saul said to his army , “ Check to see who has left our camp. ” When they checked , they learned that Jonathan and his officer were gone .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	18	So Saul said to Ahijah the priest , “ Bring the Ark of God. ” ( At that time it was with the Israelites . )
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	19	While Saul was talking to the priest , the confusion in the Philistine camp was growing . Then Saul said to Ahijah , “ Put your hand down ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	20	Then Saul gathered his army and entered the battle . They found the Philistines confused , striking each other with their swords !
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	21	Earlier , there were Hebrews who had served the Philistines and had stayed in their camp , but now they joined the Israelites with Saul and Jonathan .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	22	When all the Israelites hidden in the mountains of Ephraim heard that the Philistine soldiers were running away , they also joined the battle and chased the Philistines .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	23	So the Lord saved the Israelites that day , and the battle moved on past Beth Aven . Saul Makes Another Mistake
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	24	The men of Israel were miserable that day because Saul had made an oath for all of them . He had said , “ No one should eat food before evening and before I finish defeating my enemies . If he does , he will be cursed ! ” So no Israelite soldier ate food .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	25	Now the army went into the woods , where there was some honey on the ground .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	26	They came upon some honey , but no one took any because they were afraid of the oath .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	27	Jonathan had not heard the oath Saul had put on the army , so he dipped the end of his stick into the honey and lifted some out and ate it . Then he felt better .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then one of the soldiers told Jonathan , “ Your father made an oath for all the soldiers . He said any man who eats today will be cursed ! That ’ s why they are so weak. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	29	Jonathan said , “ My father has made trouble for the land ! See how much better I feel after just tasting a little of this honey !
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	30	It would have been much better for the men to eat the food they took from their enemies today . We could have killed many more Philistines ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	31	That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon . After that , they were very tired .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	32	They had taken sheep , cattle , and calves from the Philistines . Now they were so hungry they killed the animals on the ground and ate them , without draining the blood from them !
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	33	Someone said to Saul , “ Look ! The men are sinning against the Lord . They ’ re eating meat without draining the blood from it ! ” Saul said , “ You have sinned ! Roll a large stone over here now ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	34	Then he said , “ Go to the men and tell them that each person must bring his ox and sheep to me and kill it here and eat it . Don ’ t sin against the Lord by eating meat without draining the blood from it. ” That night everyone brought his animals and killed them there .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	35	Then Saul built an altar to the Lord . It was the first altar he had built to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	36	Saul said , “ Let ’ s go after the Philistines tonight and rob them . We won ’ t let any of them live ! ” The men answered , “ Do whatever you think is best. ” But the priest said , “ Let ’ s ask God. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul asked God , “ Should I chase the Philistines ? Will you let us defeat them ? ” But God did not answer Saul at that time .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	38	Then Saul said to all the leaders of his army , “ Come here . Let ’ s find out what sin has been done today .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	39	As surely as the Lord lives who has saved Israel , even if my son Jonathan did the sin , he must die. ” But no one in the army spoke .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then Saul said to all the Israelites , “ You stand on this side . I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side. ” The men answered , “ Do whatever you think is best. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	41	Then Saul prayed to the Lord , the God of Israel , “ Give me the right answer. ” And Saul and Jonathan were picked ; the other men went free .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	42	Saul said , “ Now let us discover if it is I or Jonathan my son who is guilty. ” And Jonathan was picked .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	43	Saul said to Jonathan , “ Tell me what you have done. ” So Jonathan told Saul , “ I only tasted a little honey from the end of my stick . And must I die now ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	44	Saul said , “ Jonathan , if you don ’ t die , may God punish me terribly. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the soldiers said to Saul , “ Must Jonathan die ? Never ! He is responsible for saving Israel today ! As surely as the Lord lives , not even a hair of his head will fall to the ground ! Today Jonathan fought against the Philistines with God ’ s help ! ” So the army saved Jonathan , and he did not die .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines , and they went back to their own land . Saul Fights Israel ’ s Enemies
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	47	When Saul became king over Israel , he fought against Israel ’ s enemies all around . He fought Moab , the Ammonites , Edom , the king of Zobah , and the Philistines . Everywhere Saul went he defeated Israel ’ s enemies .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	48	He fought bravely and defeated the Amalekites . He saved the Israelites from their enemies who had robbed them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	14	49	Saul ’ s sons were Jonathan , Ishvi , and Malki-Shua . His older daughter was named Merab , and his younger daughter was named Michal .

NCV	1%20Samuel	15	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	15	Saul answered , “ The soldiers took them from the Amalekites . They saved the best sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the Lord your God , but we destroyed all the other animals. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	2	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ When the Israelites came out of Egypt , the Amalekites tried to stop them from going to Canaan . So I will punish them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go , attack the Amalekites and destroy everything they own as an offering to the Lord . Don ’ t let anything live . Put to death men and women , children and small babies , cattle and sheep , camels and donkeys. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	4	So Saul called the army together at Telaim . There were two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	5	Then Saul went to the city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the ravine .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	6	He said to the Kenites , “ Go away . Leave the Amalekites so that I won ’ t destroy you with them , because you showed kindness to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt. ” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	7	Then Saul defeated the Amalekites . He fought them all the way from Havilah to Shur , at the border of Egypt .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	8	He took King Agag of the Amalekites alive , but he killed all of Agag ’ s army with the sword .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	9	Saul and the army let Agag live , along with the best sheep , fat cattle , and lambs . They let every good animal live , because they did not want to destroy them . But when they found an animal that was weak or useless , they killed it .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then the Lord spoke his word to Samuel :
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ I am sorry I made Saul king , because he has stopped following me and has not obeyed my commands. ” Samuel was upset , and he cried out to the Lord all night long .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	12	Early the next morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul . But the people told Samuel , “ Saul has gone to Carmel , where he has put up a monument in his own honor . Now he has gone down to Gilgal. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	13	When Samuel came to Saul , Saul said , “ May the Lord bless you ! I have obeyed the Lord ’ s commands. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	14	But Samuel said , “ Then why do I hear cattle mooing and sheep bleating ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	16	Samuel said to Saul , “ Stop ! Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night. ” Saul answered , “ Tell me. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	17	Samuel said , “ Once you didn ’ t think much of yourself , but now you have become the leader of the tribes of Israel . The Lord appointed you to be king over Israel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	18	And he sent you on a mission . He said , ‘ Go and destroy those evil people , the Amalekites . Make war on them until all of them are dead. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why didn ’ t you obey the Lord ? Why did you take the best things ? Why did you do what the Lord said was wrong ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	20	Saul said , “ But I did obey the Lord . I did what the Lord told me to do . I destroyed all the Amalekites , and I brought back Agag their king .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	21	The soldiers took the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God at Gilgal. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	22	But Samuel answered , “ What pleases the Lord more : burnt offerings and sacrifices or obedience to his voice ? It is better to obey than to sacrifice . It is better to listen to God than to offer the fat of sheep .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	23	Disobedience is as bad as the sin of sorcery . Pride is as bad as the sin of worshiping idols . You have rejected the Lord ’ s command . Now he rejects you as king. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	24	Then Saul said to Samuel , “ I have sinned . I didn ’ t obey the Lord ’ s commands and your words . I was afraid of the people , and I did what they said .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now , I beg you , forgive my sin . Come back with me so I may worship the Lord. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Samuel said to Saul , “ I won ’ t go back with you . You rejected the Lord ’ s command , and now he rejects you as king of Israel. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	27	As Samuel turned to leave , Saul caught his robe , and it tore .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	28	Samuel said to him , “ The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors who is better than you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	29	The Lord is the Eternal One of Israel . He does not lie or change his mind . He is not a human being , so he does not change his mind. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	30	Saul answered , “ I have sinned . But please honor me in front of the elders of my people and in front of the Israelites . Come back with me so that I can worship the Lord your God. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel went back with Saul , and Saul worshiped the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then Samuel said , “ Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites. ” Agag came to Samuel in chains , but Agag thought , “ Surely the threat of death has passed. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	33	Samuel said to him , “ Your sword made other mothers lose their children . Now your mother will have no children. ” And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the Lord at Gilgal .
NCV	1%20Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel left and went to Ramah , but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah .

NCV	1%20Samuel	16	16	Give us the command to look for someone who can play the harp . When the evil spirit from God troubles you , he will play , and you will feel better. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	2	But Samuel said , “ If I go , Saul will hear the news and will try to kill me. ” The Lord said , “ Take a young calf with you . Say , ‘ I have come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	3	Invite Jesse to the sacrifice . Then I will tell you what to do . You must appoint the one I show you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	4	Samuel did what the Lord told him to do . When he arrived at Bethlehem , the elders of Bethlehem shook with fear . They met him and asked , “ Are you coming in peace ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	5	Samuel answered , “ Yes , I come in peace . I have come to make a sacrifice to the Lord . Set yourselves apart to the Lord and come to the sacrifice with me. ” Then he set Jesse and his sons apart to the Lord , and he invited them to come to the sacrifice .
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	6	When they arrived , Samuel saw Eliab , and he thought , “ Surely the Lord has appointed this person standing here before him. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said to Samuel , “ Don ’ t look at how handsome Eliab is or how tall he is , because I have not chosen him . God does not see the same way people see . People look at the outside of a person , but the Lord looks at the heart. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and told him to pass by Samuel . But Samuel said , “ The Lord has not chosen this man either. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse had Shammah pass by . But Samuel said , “ No , the Lord has not chosen this one. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	10	Jesse had seven of his sons pass by Samuel . But Samuel said to him , “ The Lord has not chosen any of these. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	11	Then he asked Jesse , “ Are these all the sons you have ? ” Jesse answered , “ I still have the youngest son . He is out taking care of the sheep. ” Samuel said , “ Send for him . We will not sit down to eat until he arrives. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	12	So Jesse sent and had his youngest son brought in . He was a fine boy , tanned , and handsome . The Lord said to Samuel , “ Go , appoint him , because he is the one. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	13	So Samuel took the container of olive oil and poured it on Jesse ’ s youngest son to appoint him in front of his brothers . From that day on , the Lord ’ s Spirit worked in David . Samuel then went back to Ramah . David Serves Saul
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	14	But the Lord ’ s Spirit had left Saul , and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	16	15	Saul ’ s servants said to him , “ See , an evil spirit from God is troubling you .

NCV	1%20Samuel	17	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	17	Jesse said to his son David , “ Take this half bushel of cooked grain and ten loaves of bread to your brothers in the camp .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	2	Saul and the Israelites gathered in the Valley of Elah and camped there and took their positions to fight the Philistines .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	3	The Philistines controlled one hill while the Israelites controlled another . The valley was between them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	4	The Philistines had a champion fighter from Gath named Goliath . He was about nine feet , four inches tall . He came out of the Philistine camp
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	5	with a bronze helmet on his head and a coat of bronze armor that weighed about one hundred twenty-five pounds .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	6	He wore bronze protectors on his legs , and he had a bronze spear on his back .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	7	The wooden part of his larger spear was like a weaver ’ s rod , and its blade weighed about fifteen pounds . The officer who carried his shield walked in front of him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	8	Goliath stood and shouted to the Israelite soldiers , “ Why have you taken positions for battle ? I am a Philistine , and you are Saul ’ s servants ! Choose a man and send him to fight me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he can fight and kill me , we will be your servants . But if I can kill him , you will be our servants. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	10	Then he said , “ Today I stand and dare the army of Israel ! Send one of your men to fight me ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	11	When Saul and the Israelites heard the Philistine ’ s words , they were very scared .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	12	Now David was the son of Jesse , an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah . Jesse had eight sons . In Saul ’ s time Jesse was an old man .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	13	His three oldest sons followed Saul to the war . The first son was Eliab , the second was Abinadab , and the third was Shammah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	14	David was the youngest . Jesse ’ s three oldest sons followed Saul ,
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	15	but David went back and forth from Saul to Bethlehem , where he took care of his father ’ s sheep .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	16	For forty days the Philistine came out every morning and evening and stood before the Israelite army .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	18	Also take ten pieces of cheese to the commander and to your brothers . See how your brothers are and bring back some proof to show me that they are all right .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	19	Your brothers are with Saul and the army in the Valley of Elah , fighting against the Philistines. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	20	Early in the morning David left the sheep with another shepherd . He took the food and left as Jesse had told him . When David arrived at the camp , the army was going out to their battle positions , shouting their war cry .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	21	The Israelites and Philistines were lining up their men to face each other in battle .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	22	David left the food with the man who kept the supplies and ran to the battle line to talk to his brothers .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	23	While he was talking with them , Goliath , the Philistine champion from Gath , came out . He shouted things against Israel as usual , and David heard him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	24	When the Israelites saw Goliath , they were very much afraid and ran away .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	25	They said , “ Look at this man ! He keeps coming out to challenge Israel . The king will give much money to whoever kills him . He will also let whoever kills him marry his daughter . And his father ’ s family will not have to pay taxes in Israel. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	26	David asked the men who stood near him , “ What will be done to reward the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel ? Who does this uncircumcised Philistine think he is ? Does he think he can speak against the armies of the living God ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	27	The Israelites told David what would be done for the man who would kill Goliath .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	28	When David ’ s oldest brother Eliab heard David talking with the soldiers , he was angry with David . He asked David , “ Why did you come here ? Who ’ s taking care of those few sheep of yours in the desert ? I know you are proud and wicked at heart . You came down here just to watch the battle. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	29	David asked , “ Now what have I done wrong ? Can ’ t I even talk ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	30	When he turned to other people and asked the same questions , they gave him the same answer as before .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	31	Yet what David said was told to Saul , and he sent for David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	32	David said to Saul , “ Don ’ t let anyone be discouraged . I , your servant , will go and fight this Philistine ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	33	Saul answered , “ You can ’ t go out against this Philistine and fight him . You ’ re only a boy . Goliath has been a warrior since he was a young man. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	34	But David said to Saul , “ I , your servant , have been keeping my father ’ s sheep . When a lion or bear came and took a sheep from the flock ,
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	35	I would chase it . I would attack it and save the sheep from its mouth . When it attacked me , I caught it by its fur and hit it and killed it .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	36	I , your servant , have killed both a lion and a bear ! This uncircumcised Philistine will be like them , because he has spoken against the armies of the living God .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	37	The Lord who saved me from a lion and a bear will save me from this Philistine. ” Saul said to David , “ Go , and may the Lord be with you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	38	Saul put his own clothes on David . He put a bronze helmet on his head and dressed him in armor .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	39	David put on Saul ’ s sword and tried to walk around , but he was not used to all the armor Saul had put on him . He said to Saul , “ I can ’ t go in this , because I ’ m not used to it. ” Then David took it all off .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	40	He took his stick in his hand and chose five smooth stones from a stream . He put them in his shepherd ’ s bag and grabbed his sling . Then he went to meet the Philistine .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	41	At the same time , the Philistine was coming closer to David . The man who held his shield walked in front of him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	42	When Goliath looked at David and saw that he was only a boy , tanned and handsome , he looked down on David with disgust .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	43	He said , “ Do you think I am a dog , that you come at me with a stick ? ” He used his gods ’ names to curse David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	44	He said to David , “ Come here . I ’ ll feed your body to the birds of the air and the wild animals ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	45	But David said to him , “ You come to me using a sword and two spears . But I come to you in the name of the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the armies of Israel ! You have spoken against him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	46	Today the Lord will hand you over to me , and I ’ ll kill you and cut off your head . Today I ’ ll feed the bodies of the Philistine soldiers to the birds of the air and the wild animals . Then all the world will know there is a God in Israel !
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	47	Everyone gathered here will know the Lord does not need swords or spears to save people . The battle belongs to him , and he will hand you over to us. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	48	As Goliath came near to attack him , David ran quickly to meet him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	49	He took a stone from his bag , put it into his sling , and slung it . The stone hit the Philistine and went deep into his forehead , and Goliath fell facedown on the ground .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David defeated the Philistine with only a sling and a stone . He hit him and killed him . He did not even have a sword in his hand .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	51	Then David ran and stood beside him . He took Goliath ’ s sword out of its holder and killed him by cutting off his head . When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead , they turned and ran .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	52	The men of Israel and Judah shouted and chased the Philistines all the way to the entrance of the city of Gath and to the gates of Ekron . The Philistines ’ bodies lay on the Shaaraim road as far as Gath and Ekron .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	53	The Israelites returned after chasing the Philistines and robbed their camp .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	54	David took Goliath ’ s head to Jerusalem and put Goliath ’ s weapons in his own tent .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	55	When Saul saw David go out to meet Goliath , Saul asked Abner , commander of the army , “ Abner , who is that young man ’ s father ? ” Abner answered , “ As surely as you live , my king , I don ’ t know. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	56	The king said , “ Find out whose son he is. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	57	When David came back from killing Goliath , Abner brought him to Saul . David was still holding Goliath ’ s head .
NCV	1%20Samuel	17	58	Saul asked him , “ Young man , who is your father ? ” David answered , “ I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	18	But David answered Saul , saying , “ Who am I ? My family is not important enough for me to become the king ’ s son-in-law. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	2	Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him go home to his father ’ s house .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	3	Jonathan made an agreement with David , because he loved David as much as himself .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	4	He took off his coat and gave it to David , along with his armor , including his sword , bow , and belt .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	5	Saul sent David to fight in different battles , and David was very successful . Then Saul put David over the soldiers , which pleased Saul ’ s officers and all the other people .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	6	After David had killed the Philistine , he and the men returned home . Women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul . They sang songs of joy , danced , and played tambourines and stringed instruments .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	7	As they played , they sang , “ Saul has killed thousands of his enemies , but David has killed tens of thousands. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	8	The women ’ s song upset Saul , and he became very angry . He thought , “ The women say David has killed tens of thousands , but they say I have killed only thousands . The only thing left for him to have is the kingdom ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	9	So Saul watched David closely from then on , because he was jealous .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	10	The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul , and he prophesied in his house . David was playing the harp as he usually did , but Saul had a spear in his hand .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	11	He threw the spear , thinking , “ I ’ ll pin David to the wall. ” But David escaped from him twice .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	12	The Lord was with David but had left Saul . So Saul was afraid of David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	13	He sent David away and made him commander of a thousand soldiers . So David led them in battle .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	14	He had great success in everything he did because the Lord was with him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	15	When Saul saw that David was very successful , he feared David even more .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	16	But all the people of Israel and Judah loved David because he led them well in battle . Saul ’ s Daughter Marries David
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	17	Saul said to David , “ Here is my older daughter Merab . I will let you marry her . All I ask is that you remain brave and fight the Lord ’ s battles. ” Saul thought , “ I won ’ t have to kill David . The Philistines will do that. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	19	So , when the time came for Saul ’ s daughter Merab to marry David , Saul gave her instead to Adriel of Meholah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	20	Now Saul ’ s other daughter , Michal , loved David . When they told Saul , he was pleased .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	21	He thought , “ I will let her marry David . Then she will be a trap for him , and the Philistines will defeat him. ” So Saul said to David a second time , “ You may become my son-in-law. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	22	And Saul ordered his servants to talk with David in private and say , “ Look , the king likes you . His servants love you . You should be his son-in-law. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	23	Saul ’ s servants said these words to David , but David answered , “ Do you think it is easy to become the king ’ s son-in-law ? I am poor and unimportant. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	24	When Saul ’ s servants told him what David had said ,
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	25	Saul said , “ Tell David , ‘ The king doesn ’ t want money for the bride . All he wants is a hundred Philistine foreskins to get even with his enemies. ’ ” Saul planned to let the Philistines kill David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	26	When Saul ’ s servants told this to David , he was pleased to become the king ’ s son-in-law .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	27	So he and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines . David brought all their foreskins to Saul so he could be the king ’ s son-in-law . Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal for his wife .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	28	Saul saw that the Lord was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	29	So he grew even more afraid of David , and he was David ’ s enemy all his life .
NCV	1%20Samuel	18	30	The Philistine commanders continued to go out to fight the Israelites , but every time , David was more skillful than Saul ’ s officers . So he became famous . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	19	Saul heard that David was in Naioth at Ramah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	2	So he warned David , “ My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you . Watch out in the morning . Hide in a secret place .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	3	I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are hiding , and I ’ ll talk to him about you . Then I ’ ll let you know what I find out. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	4	When Jonathan talked to Saul his father , he said good things about David . Jonathan said , “ The king should do no wrong to your servant David since he has done nothing wrong to you . What he has done has helped you greatly .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	5	David risked his life when he killed Goliath the Philistine , and the Lord won a great victory for all Israel . You saw it and were happy . Why would you do wrong against David ? He ’ s innocent . There ’ s no reason to kill him ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	6	Saul listened to Jonathan and then made this promise : “ As surely as the Lord lives , David won ’ t be put to death. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	7	So Jonathan called to David and told him everything that had been said . He brought David to Saul , and David was with Saul as before .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	8	When war broke out again , David went out to fight the Philistines . He defeated them , and they ran away from him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	9	But once again an evil spirit from the Lord rushed upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand . David was playing the harp .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	10	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear , but David jumped out of the way . So Saul ’ s spear went into the wall , and David ran away that night .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	11	Saul sent messengers to David ’ s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning . But Michal , David ’ s wife , warned him , saying , “ Tonight you must run for your life . If you don ’ t , you will be dead in the morning. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	12	So she let David down out of a window , and he ran away and escaped .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	13	Then Michal took an idol , laid it on the bed , covered it with clothes , and put goats ’ hair at its head .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	14	Saul sent messengers to take David prisoner , but Michal said , “ He is sick. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	15	Saul sent them back to see David , saying , “ Bring him to me on his bed so I can kill him. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	16	When the messengers entered David ’ s house , they found just an idol on the bed with goats ’ hair on its head .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	17	Saul said to Michal , “ Why did you trick me this way ? You let my enemy go so he could run away ! ” Michal answered Saul , “ David told me if I did not help him escape , he would kill me. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	18	After David had escaped from Saul , he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him everything Saul had done to him . Then David and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	20	So he sent messengers to capture him . But they met a group of prophets prophesying , with Samuel standing there leading them . So the Spirit of God entered Saul ’ s men , and they also prophesied .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	21	When Saul heard the news , he sent more messengers , but they also prophesied . Then he sent messengers a third time , but they also prophesied .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	22	Finally , Saul himself went to Ramah , to the well at Secu . He asked , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” The people answered , “ In Naioth at Ramah. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	23	When Saul went to Naioth at Ramah , the Spirit of God also rushed upon him . And he walked on , prophesying until he came to Naioth at Ramah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	19	24	He took off his robes and prophesied in front of Samuel . He lay that way all day and all night . That is why people ask , “ Is even Saul one of the prophets ? ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	20	On the third day I will shoot three arrows to the side of the rock as if I am shooting at a target .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	2	Jonathan answered , “ No ! You won ’ t die ! See , my father doesn ’ t do anything great or small without first telling me . Why would he keep this from me ? It ’ s not true ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	3	But David took an oath , saying , “ Your father knows very well that you like me . He says to himself , ‘ Jonathan must not know about it , or he will tell David. ’ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live , I am only a step away from death ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	4	Jonathan said to David , “ I ’ ll do anything you want me to do. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	5	So David said , “ Look , tomorrow is the New Moon festival . I am supposed to eat with the king , but let me hide in the field until the third evening .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	6	If your father notices I am gone , tell him , ‘ David begged me to let him go to his hometown of Bethlehem . Every year at this time his family group offers a sacrifice. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	7	If your father says , ‘ Fine , ’ I am safe . But if he becomes angry , you will know that he wants to hurt me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	8	Jonathan , be loyal to me , your servant . You have made an agreement with me before the Lord . If I am guilty , you may kill me yourself ! Why hand me over to your father ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	9	Jonathan answered , “ No , never ! If I learn that my father plans to hurt you , I will warn you ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	10	David asked , “ Who will let me know if your father answers you unkindly ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	11	Then Jonathan said , “ Come , let ’ s go out into the field. ” So the two of them went out into the field .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	12	Jonathan said to David , “ I promise this before the Lord , the God of Israel : At this same time the day after tomorrow , I will find out how my father feels . If he feels good toward you , I will send word to you and let you know .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	13	But if my father plans to hurt you , I will let you know and send you away safely . May the Lord punish me terribly if I don ’ t do this . And may the Lord be with you as he has been with my father .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	14	But show me the kindness of the Lord as long as I live so that I may not die .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	15	You must never stop showing your kindness to my family , even when the Lord has destroyed all your enemies from the earth. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made an agreement with David . He said , “ May the Lord hold David ’ s enemies responsible. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan asked David to repeat his promise of love for him , because he loved David as much as he loved himself .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	18	Jonathan said to David , “ Tomorrow is the New Moon festival . Your seat will be empty , so my father will miss you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	19	On the third day go to the place where you hid when this trouble began . Wait by the rock Ezel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	21	Then I will send a boy to find the arrows . If I say to him , ‘ The arrows are near you ; bring them here , ’ you may come out of hiding . You are safe . As the Lord lives , there is no danger .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I say to the boy , ‘ Look , the arrows are beyond you , ’ you must go , because the Lord is sending you away .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	23	Remember what we talked about . The Lord is a witness between you and me forever. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid in the field . When the New Moon festival came , the king sat down to eat .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	25	He sat where he always sat , near the wall . Jonathan sat across from him , and Abner sat next to Saul , but David ’ s place was empty .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	26	That day Saul said nothing . He thought , “ Maybe something has happened to David so that he is unclean. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	27	But the next day was the second day of the month , and David ’ s place was still empty . So Saul said to Jonathan , “ Why hasn ’ t the son of Jesse come to the feast yesterday or today ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	28	Jonathan answered , “ David begged me to let him go to Bethlehem .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , ‘ Let me go , because our family has a sacrifice in the town , and my brother has ordered me to be there . Now if I am your friend , please let me go to see my brothers. ’ That is why he has not come to the king ’ s table. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	30	Then Saul became very angry with Jonathan . He said , “ You son of a wicked , worthless woman ! I know you are on the side of David son of Jesse ! You bring shame on yourself and on your mother who gave birth to you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	31	As long as Jesse ’ s son lives , you will never be king or have a kingdom . Now send for David and bring him to me . He must die ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	32	Jonathan asked his father , “ Why should David be killed ? What wrong has he done ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	33	Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan , trying to kill him . So Jonathan knew that his father really wanted to kill David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	34	Jonathan was very angry and left the table . That second day of the month he refused to eat . He was ashamed of his father and upset over David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	35	The next morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David as they had agreed . He had a young boy with him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	36	Jonathan said to the boy , “ Run and find the arrows I shoot. ” When he ran , Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	37	The boy ran to the place where Jonathan ’ s arrow fell , but Jonathan called , “ The arrow is beyond you ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	38	Then he shouted , “ Hurry ! Go quickly ! Don ’ t stop ! ” The boy picked up the arrow and brought it back to his master .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	39	( The boy knew nothing about what this meant ; only Jonathan and David knew . )
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him , “ Go back to town. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	41	When the boy left , David came out from the south side of the rock . He bowed facedown on the ground before Jonathan three times . Then David and Jonathan kissed each other and cried together , but David cried the most .
NCV	1%20Samuel	20	42	Jonathan said to David , “ Go in peace . We have promised by the Lord that we will be friends . We said , ‘ The Lord will be a witness between you and me , and between our descendants always. ’ ” Then David left , and Jonathan went back to town . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	1%20Samuel	21	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	21	David went to Nob to see Ahimelech the priest . Ahimelech shook with fear when he saw David , and he asked , “ Why are you alone ? Why is no one with you ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	2	David answered him , “ The king gave me a special order . He told me , ‘ No one must know what I am sending you to do or what I told you to do. ’ I told my men where to meet me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	3	Now , what food do you have with you ? Give me five loaves of bread or anything you find. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	4	The priest said to David , “ I don ’ t have any plain bread here , but I do have some holy bread . [ a ] You may eat it if your men have kept themselves from women. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	5	David answered , “ No women have been near us for days . My men always keep themselves holy , even when we do ordinary work . And this is especially true when the work is holy. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave David the holy bread from the presence of God because there was no other . Each day the holy bread was replaced with hot bread .
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	7	One of Saul ’ s servants happened to be there that day . He had been held there before the Lord . He was Doeg the Edomite , the chief of Saul ’ s shepherds .
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	8	David asked Ahimelech , “ Do you have a spear or sword here ? The king ’ s business was very important , so I left without my sword or any other weapon. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	9	The priest answered , “ The sword of Goliath the Philistine , the one you killed in the Valley of Elah , is here . It is wrapped in a cloth behind the holy vest . If you want it , you may take it . There ’ s no other sword here but that one. ” David said , “ There is no other sword like it . Give it to me. ” David Goes to Gath
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	10	That day David ran away from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath .
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	11	But the servants of Achish said to him , “ This is David , the king of the Israelites . He ’ s the man they dance and sing about , saying : ‘ Saul has killed thousands of his enemies , but David has killed tens of thousands. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	12	David paid attention to these words and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath .
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	13	So he pretended to be crazy in front of Achish and his servants . While he was with them , he acted like a madman and clawed on the doors of the gate and let spit run down his beard .
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	14	Achish said to his servants , “ Look at the man ! He ’ s crazy ! Why do you bring him to me ?
NCV	1%20Samuel	21	15	I have enough madmen . I don ’ t need you to bring him here to act like this in front of me ! Don ’ t let him in my house ! ” Footnotes - 21:4 holy bread This was the bread that showed the people were in the presence of God . Normally only the priests ate this bread .

NCV	1%20Samuel	22	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	22	Then David told him , “ Doeg the Edomite was there at Nob that day . I knew he would surely tell Saul . So I am responsible for the death of all your father ’ s family .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	2	Everyone who was in trouble , or who owed money , or who was unsatisfied gathered around David , and he became their leader . About four hundred men were with him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	3	From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and spoke to the king of Moab . He said , “ Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God is going to do for me. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	4	So he left them with the king of Moab , and they stayed with him as long as David was hiding in the stronghold .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	5	But the prophet Gad said to David , “ Don ’ t stay in the stronghold . Go to the land of Judah. ” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth . Saul Destroys Ahimelech ’ s Family
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	6	Saul heard that David and his men had been seen . Saul was sitting under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah , and all his officers were standing around him . He had a spear in his hand .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	7	Saul said to them , “ Listen , men of Benjamin ! Do you think the son of Jesse will give all of you fields and vineyards ? Will David make you commanders over thousands of men or hundreds of men ?
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	8	You have all made plans against me ! No one tells me when my son makes an agreement with the son of Jesse ! No one cares about me ! No one tells me when my son has encouraged my servant to ambush me this very day ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	9	Doeg the Edomite , who was standing there with Saul ’ s officers , said , “ I saw the son of Jesse . He came to see Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	10	Ahimelech prayed to the Lord for David and gave him food and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and for all of Ahimelech ’ s relatives who were priests at Nob . And they all came to the king .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	12	Saul said to Ahimelech , “ Listen now , son of Ahitub. ” Ahimelech answered , “ Yes , master. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	13	Saul said , “ Why are you and Jesse ’ s son against me ? You gave him bread and a sword ! You prayed to God for him . David has turned against me and is waiting to attack me even now ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	14	Ahimelech answered , “ You have no other servant who is as loyal as David , your own son-in-law and captain of your bodyguards . Everyone in your house respects him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	15	That was not the first time I prayed to God for David . Don ’ t blame me or any of my relatives . I , your servant , know nothing about what is going on. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	16	But the king said , “ Ahimelech , you and all your relatives must die ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	17	Then he told the guards at his side , “ Go and kill the priests of the Lord , because they are on David ’ s side . They knew he was running away , but they didn ’ t tell me. ” But the king ’ s officers refused to kill the priests of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	18	Then the king ordered Doeg , “ Go and kill the priests. ” So Doeg the Edomite went and killed the priests . That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen holy vest .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	19	He also killed the people of Nob , the city of the priests . With the sword he killed men , women , children , babies , cattle , donkeys , and sheep .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	20	But Abiathar , a son of Ahimelech , who was the son of Ahitub , escaped . He ran away and joined David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	22	21	He told David that Saul had killed the Lord ’ s priests .

NCV	1%20Samuel	23	23	Find all the hiding places he uses , and come back and tell me everything . Then I ’ ll go with you . If David is in the area , I will track him down among all the families in Judah. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	2	David asked the Lord , “ Should I go and fight these Philistines ? ” The Lord answered him , “ Go . Attack them , and save Keilah. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said to him , “ We ’ re afraid here in Judah . We will be more afraid if we go to Keilah where the Philistine army is. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	4	David again asked the Lord , and the Lord answered , “ Go down to Keilah . I will help you defeat the Philistines. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines and took their cattle . David killed many Philistines and saved the people of Keilah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	6	( Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the holy vest with him when he came to David at Keilah . ) Saul Chases David
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	7	Someone told Saul that David was now at Keilah . Saul said , “ God has handed David over to me ! He has trapped himself , because he has entered a town with gates and bars. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	8	Saul called all his army together for battle , and they prepared to go down to Keilah to attack David and his men .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	9	David learned Saul was making evil plans against him . So he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring the holy vest. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	10	David prayed , “ Lord , God of Israel , I have heard that Saul plans to come to Keilah to destroy the town because of me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the leaders of Keilah hand me over to Saul ? Will Saul come down to Keilah , as I heard ? Lord , God of Israel , tell me , your servant ! ” The Lord answered , “ Saul will come down. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	12	Again David asked , “ Will the leaders of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul ? ” The Lord answered , “ They will. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his six hundred men left Keilah and kept moving from place to place . When Saul found out that David had escaped from Keilah , he did not go there .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	14	David stayed in the desert hideouts and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph . Every day Saul looked for David , but the Lord did not surrender David to him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	15	While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph , he learned that Saul was coming to kill him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	16	But Saul ’ s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and strengthened his faith in God .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	17	Jonathan told him , “ Don ’ t be afraid , because my father won ’ t touch you . You will be king of Israel , and I will be second to you . Even my father Saul knows this. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	18	The two of them made an agreement before the Lord . Then Jonathan went home , but David stayed at Horesh .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	19	The people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and told him , “ David is hiding in our land . He ’ s at the hideouts of Horesh , on the hill of Hakilah , south of Jeshimon .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now , our king , come down anytime you want . It ’ s our duty to hand David over to you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	21	Saul answered , “ The Lord bless you for helping me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go and learn more about him . Find out where he is staying and who has seen him there . I have heard that he is clever .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	24	So they went back to Ziph ahead of Saul . Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon [ a ] in the desert area south of Jeshimon .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	25	Saul and his men went to look for David , but David heard about it and went down to a rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon . When Saul heard that , he followed David into the Desert of Maon .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul was going along one side of the mountain , and David and his men were on the other side . They were hurrying to get away from Saul , because Saul and his men were closing in on them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	27	But a messenger came to Saul , saying , “ Come quickly ! The Philistines are attacking our land ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	28	So Saul stopped chasing David and went to challenge the Philistines . That is why people call this place Rock of Parting .
NCV	1%20Samuel	23	29	David also left the Desert of Maon and stayed in the hideouts of En Gedi . Footnotes - 23:24 Maon Some early Greek copies say “ Maon. ” The Hebrew copies say “ Paran. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	24	After Saul returned from chasing the Philistines , he was told , “ David is in the Desert of En Gedi. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	2	So he took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and began looking for David and his men near the Rocks of the Wild Goats .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	3	Saul came to the sheep pens beside the road . A cave was there , and he went in to relieve himself . Now David and his men were hiding far back in the cave .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	4	The men said to David , “ Today is the day the Lord spoke of when he said , ‘ I will give your enemy over to you . Do anything you want with him. ’ ” Then David crept up to Saul and quietly cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	5	Later David felt guilty because he had cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	6	He said to his men , “ May the Lord keep me from doing such a thing to my master ! Saul is the Lord ’ s appointed king . I should not do anything against him , because he is the Lord ’ s appointed king ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	7	David used these words to stop his men ; he did not let them attack Saul . Then Saul left the cave and went his way .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	8	When David came out of the cave , he shouted to Saul , “ My master and king ! ” Saul looked back , and David bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	9	He said to Saul , “ Why do you listen when people say , ‘ David wants to harm you ’ ?
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	10	You have seen something with your own eyes today . The Lord put you in my power in the cave . They said I should kill you , but I was merciful . I said , ‘ I won ’ t harm my master , because he is the Lord ’ s appointed king. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	11	My father , look at this piece of your robe in my hand ! I cut off the corner of your robe , but I didn ’ t kill you . Now understand and know I am not planning any evil against you . I did nothing wrong to you , but you are hunting me to kill me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	12	May the Lord judge between us , and may he punish you for the wrong you have done to me ! But I am not against you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	13	There is an old saying : ‘ Evil things come from evil people. ’ But I am not against you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	14	Whom is the king of Israel coming out against ? Whom are you chasing ? It ’ s as if you are chasing a dead dog or a flea .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	15	May the Lord be our judge and decide between you and me . May he support me and show that I am right . May he save me from you ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	16	When David finished saying these words , Saul asked , “ Is that your voice , David my son ? ” And he cried loudly .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	17	He said , “ You are a better man than I am . You have been good to me , but I have done wrong to you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	18	You told me what good things you did . The Lord handed me over to you , but you did not kill me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	19	People don ’ t normally let an enemy get away like this , do they ? May the Lord reward you because you were good to me today .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	20	I know you will surely be king , and you will rule the kingdom of Israel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	24	21	Now swear to me by the Lord that you will not kill my descendants and that you won ’ t wipe out my name from my father ’ s family. ”

NCV	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	25	My master , don ’ t pay attention to this worthless man Nabal . He is like his name . His name means ‘ fool , ’ and he is truly a fool . But I , your servant , didn ’ t see the men you sent .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	2	A man in Maon who had land at Carmel was very rich . He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats . He was cutting the wool off his sheep at Carmel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	3	His name was Nabal , and he was a descendant of Caleb . His wife was named Abigail . She was wise and beautiful , but Nabal was cruel and mean .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	4	While David was in the desert , he heard that Nabal was cutting the wool from his sheep .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	5	So he sent ten young men and told them , “ Go to Nabal at Carmel , and greet him for me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	6	Say to Nabal , ‘ May you and your family and all who belong to you have good health !
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	7	I have heard that you are cutting the wool from your sheep . When your shepherds were with us , we did not harm them . All the time your shepherds were at Carmel , we stole nothing from them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your servants , and they will tell you . We come at a happy time , so be kind to my young men . Please give anything you can find for them and for your son David. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	9	When David ’ s men arrived , they gave the message to Nabal , but Nabal insulted them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	10	He answered them , “ Who is David ? Who is this son of Jesse ? Many slaves are running away from their masters today !
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	11	I have bread and water , and I have meat that I killed for my servants who cut the wool . But I won ’ t give it to men I don ’ t know. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	12	David ’ s men went back and told him all Nabal had said .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	13	Then David said to them , “ Put on your swords ! ” So they put on their swords , and David put on his also . About four hundred men went with David , but two hundred men stayed with the supplies .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	14	One of Nabal ’ s servants said to Abigail , Nabal ’ s wife , “ David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master , but Nabal insulted them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	15	These men were very good to us . They did not harm us . They stole nothing from us during all the time we were out in the field with them .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	16	Night and day they protected us . They were like a wall around us while we were with them caring for the sheep .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	17	Now think about it , and decide what you can do . Terrible trouble is coming to our master and all his family . Nabal is such a wicked man that no one can even talk to him. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	18	Abigail hurried . She took two hundred loaves of bread , two leather bags full of wine , five cooked sheep , a bushel of cooked grain , a hundred cakes of raisins , and two hundred cakes of pressed figs and put all these on donkeys .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	19	Then she told her servants , “ Go on . I ’ ll follow you. ” But she did not tell her husband .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	20	Abigail rode her donkey and came down toward the mountain hideout . There she met David and his men coming down toward her .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had just said , “ It ’ s been useless ! I watched over Nabal ’ s property in the desert . I made sure none of his sheep was missing . I did good to him , but he has paid me back with evil .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	22	May God punish my enemies even more . I will not leave one of Nabal ’ s men alive until morning. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Abigail saw David , she quickly got off her donkey and bowed facedown on the ground before him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	24	She fell at David ’ s feet and said , “ My master , let the blame be on me ! Please let me talk to you . Listen to what I say .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	26	The Lord has kept you from killing and punishing anyone . As surely as the Lord lives and as surely as you live , may your enemies become like Nabal !
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	27	I have brought a gift to you for the men who follow you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	28	Please forgive my wrong . The Lord will certainly let your family have many kings , because you fight his battles . As long as you live , may you do nothing bad .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	29	Someone might chase you to kill you , but the Lord your God will keep you alive . He will throw away your enemies ’ lives as he would throw a stone from a sling .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	30	The Lord will keep all his promises of good things for you . He will make you leader over Israel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	31	Then you won ’ t feel guilty or troubled because you killed innocent people and punished them . Please remember me when the Lord brings you success. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	32	David answered Abigail , “ Praise the Lord , the God of Israel , who sent you to meet me .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	33	May you be blessed for your wisdom . You have kept me from killing or punishing people today .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	34	As surely as the Lord , the God of Israel , lives , he has kept me from hurting you . If you hadn ’ t come quickly to meet me , not one of Nabal ’ s men would have lived until morning. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	35	Then David accepted Abigail ’ s gifts . He told her , “ Go home in peace . I have heard your words , and I will do what you have asked. ” Nabal ’ s Death
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	36	When Abigail went back to Nabal , he was in the house , eating like a king . He was very drunk and in a good mood . So she told him nothing until the next morning .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	37	In the morning when he was not drunk , his wife told him everything . His heart stopped , and he became like stone .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	38	About ten days later the Lord struck Nabal and he died .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , “ Praise the Lord ! Nabal insulted me , but the Lord has supported me ! He has kept me from doing wrong . The Lord has punished Nabal for his wrong. ” Then David sent a message to Abigail , asking her to be his wife .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	40	His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail , “ David sent us to take you so you can become his wife. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	41	Abigail bowed facedown on the ground and said , “ I am your servant . I ’ m ready to serve you and to wash the feet of my master ’ s servants. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	42	Abigail quickly got on a donkey and went with David ’ s messengers , with her five maids following her . And she became David ’ s wife .
NCV	1%20Samuel	25	43	David also had married Ahinoam of Jezreel . So they were both David ’ s wives .

NCV	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	26	The people of Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and said to him , “ David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	2	So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to look for David there .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	3	Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon , but David stayed in the desert . When he heard Saul had followed him ,
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	4	he sent out spies and learned for certain that Saul had come to Hakilah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	5	Then David went to the place where Saul had camped . He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner , the commander of Saul ’ s army , were sleeping . Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp with all the army around him .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	6	David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah , Joab ’ s brother , “ Who will go down into Saul ’ s camp with me ? ” Abishai answered , “ I ’ ll go with you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	7	So that night David and Abishai went into Saul ’ s camp . Saul was asleep in the middle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head . Abner and the army were sleeping around Saul .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	8	Abishai said to David , “ Today God has handed your enemy over to you . Let me pin Saul to the ground with my spear . I ’ ll only have to do it once . I won ’ t need to hit him twice. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , “ Don ’ t kill Saul ! No one can harm the Lord ’ s appointed king and still be innocent !
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	10	As surely as the Lord lives , the Lord himself will punish Saul . Maybe Saul will die naturally , or maybe he will go into battle and be killed .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	11	But may the Lord keep me from harming his appointed king ! Take the spear and water jug that are near Saul ’ s head . Then let ’ s go. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and water jug that were near Saul ’ s head , and they left . No one saw them or knew about it or woke up , because the Lord had put them sound asleep .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	13	David crossed over to the other side of the hill and stood on top of the mountain far from Saul ’ s camp . They were a long way away from each other .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	14	David shouted to the army and to Abner son of Ner , “ Won ’ t you answer me , Abner ? ” Abner answered , “ Who is calling for the king ? Who are you ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	15	David said , “ You ’ re the greatest man in Israel . Isn ’ t that true ? Why didn ’ t you guard your master the king ? Someone came into your camp to kill your master the king !
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	16	You have not done well . As surely as the Lord lives , you and your men should die . You haven ’ t guarded your master , the Lord ’ s appointed king . Look ! Where are the king ’ s spear and water jug that were near his head ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul knew David ’ s voice . He said , “ Is that your voice , David my son ? ” David answered , “ Yes , it is , my master and king. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	18	David also said , “ Why are you chasing me , my master ? What wrong have I done ? What evil am I guilty of ?
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	19	My master and king , listen to me . If the Lord made you angry with me , let him accept an offering . But if people did it , may the Lord curse them ! They have made me leave the land the Lord gave me . They have told me , ‘ Go and serve other gods. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	20	Now don ’ t let me die far away from the Lord ’ s presence . The king of Israel has come out looking for a flea ! You ’ re just hunting a bird in the mountains ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , “ I have sinned . Come back , David my son . Today you respected my life , so I will not try to hurt you . I have been very stupid and foolish. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	22	David answered , “ Here is your spear . Let one of your young men come here and get it .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	23	The Lord rewards us for the things we do right and for our loyalty to him . The Lord handed you over to me today , but I wouldn ’ t harm the Lord ’ s appointed king .
NCV	1%20Samuel	26	24	As I respected your life today , may the Lord also respect my life and save me from all trouble. ”

NCV	1%20Samuel	27	27	But David thought to himself , “ Saul will catch me someday . The best thing I can do is escape to the land of the Philistines . Then he will give up looking for me in Israel , and I can get away from him. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	2	So David and his six hundred men left Israel and went to Achish son of Maoch , king of Gath .
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	3	David , his men , and their families made their home in Gath with Achish . David had his two wives with him—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel , the widow of Nabal .

NCV	1%20Samuel	27	5	Then David said to Achish , “ If you are pleased with me , give me a place in one of the country towns where I can live . I don ’ t need to live in the royal city with you. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	6	That day Achish gave David the town of Ziklag , and Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since .
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	7	David lived in the Philistine land a year and four months .
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	8	David and his men raided the people of Geshur , Girzi , and Amalek . ( These people had lived for a long time in the land that reached to Shur and Egypt . )
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	9	When David fought them , he killed all the men and women and took their sheep , cattle , donkeys , camels , and clothes . Then he returned to Achish .
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	10	Achish would ask David , “ Where did you go raiding today ? ” And David would tell him that he had gone to the southern part of Judah , or Jerahmeel , or to the land of the Kenites .
NCV	1%20Samuel	27	11	David never brought a man or woman alive to Gath . He thought , “ If we bring people alive , they may tell Achish , ‘ This is what David really did. ’ ” David did this all the time he lived in the Philistine land .

NCV	1%20Samuel	28	28	Later , the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Israel . Achish said to David , “ You understand that you and your men must join my army. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	2	David answered , “ You will see for yourself what I , your servant , can do ! ” Achish said , “ Fine , I ’ ll make you my permanent bodyguard. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	3	Now Samuel was dead , and all the Israelites had shown their sadness for him . They had buried Samuel in his hometown of Ramah . And Saul had forced out the mediums and fortune-tellers from the land .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines came together and made camp at Shunem . Saul gathered all the Israelites and made camp at Gilboa .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	5	When he saw the Philistine army , he was afraid , and his heart pounded with fear .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	6	He prayed to the Lord , but the Lord did not answer him through dreams , Urim , or prophets .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then Saul said to his servants , “ Find me a woman who is a medium so I may go and ask her what will happen. ” His servants answered , “ There is a medium in Endor. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	8	Then Saul put on other clothes to disguise himself , and at night he and two of his men went to see the woman . Saul said to her , “ Talk to a spirit for me . Bring up the person I name. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	9	But the woman said to him , “ Surely you know what Saul has done . He has forced the mediums and fortune-tellers from the land . You are trying to trap me and get me killed. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	10	Saul made a promise to the woman in the name of the Lord . He said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , you won ’ t be punished for this. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	11	The woman asked , “ Whom do you want me to bring up ? ” He answered , “ Bring up Samuel. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she screamed . She said , “ Why have you tricked me ? You are Saul ! ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	13	The king said to the woman , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! What do you see ? ” The woman said , “ I see a spirit coming up out of the ground. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	14	Saul asked , “ What does he look like ? ” The woman answered , “ An old man wearing a coat is coming up. ” Then Saul knew it was Samuel , and he bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	15	Samuel asked Saul , “ Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up ? ” Saul said , “ I am greatly troubled . The Philistines are fighting against me , and God has left me . He won ’ t answer me anymore , either by prophets or in dreams . That ’ s why I called for you . Tell me what to do. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	16	Samuel said , “ The Lord has left you and has become your enemy . So why do you call on me ?
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	17	He has done what he said he would do—the things he said through me . He has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors , David .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	18	You did not obey the Lord ; you did not show the Amalekites how angry he was with them . That ’ s why he has done this to you today .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	19	The Lord will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines . Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . The Lord will hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	20	Saul quickly fell flat on the ground and was afraid of what Samuel had said . He was also very weak because he had eaten nothing all that day and night .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	21	Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was really frightened . She said , “ Look , I , your servant , have obeyed you . I have risked my life and done what you told me to do .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	22	Now please listen to me . Let me give you some food so you may eat and have enough strength to go on your way. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	23	But Saul refused , saying , “ I won ’ t eat. ” His servants joined the woman in asking him to eat , and he listened to them . So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	24	At the house the woman had a fat calf , which she quickly killed . She took some flour and mixed dough with her hands . Then she baked some bread without yeast .
NCV	1%20Samuel	28	25	She put the food before them , and they ate . That same night they got up and left . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	29	2	The Philistine kings were marching with their groups of a hundred and a thousand men . David and his men were marching behind Achish .
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	3	The Philistine commanders asked , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” Achish told them , “ This is David . He served Saul king of Israel , but he has been with me for over a year now . I have found nothing wrong in David since the time he left Saul. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said , “ Send David back to the city you gave him . He can not go with us into battle . If he does , we ’ ll have an enemy in our own camp . He could please his king by killing our own men .
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	5	David is the one the Israelites dance and sing about , saying : ‘ Saul has killed thousands of his enemies , but David has killed tens of thousands. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Achish called David and said to him , “ As surely as the Lord lives , you are loyal . I would be pleased to have you serve in my army . Since the day you came to me , I have found no wrong in you . But the other kings don ’ t trust you .
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	7	Go back in peace . Don ’ t do anything to displease the Philistine kings. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	8	David asked , “ What wrong have I done ? What evil have you found in me from the day I came to you until now ? Why can ’ t I go fight your enemies , my lord and king ? ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	9	Achish answered , “ I know you are as good as an angel from God . But the Philistine commanders have said , ‘ David must not go with us into battle. ’
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	10	Early in the morning you and your master ’ s servants should leave . Get up as soon as it is light and go. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David and his men got up early in the morning and went back to the country of the Philistines . And the Philistines went up to Jezreel . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Samuel	30	3	When David and his men came to Ziklag , they found the town had been burned and their wives , sons , and daughters had been taken as prisoners .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	4	Then David and his army cried loudly until they were too weak to cry anymore .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	5	David ’ s two wives had also been taken—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal from Carmel .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	6	The men in the army were threatening to kill David with stones , which greatly upset David . Each man was sad and angry because his sons and daughters had been captured , but David found strength in the Lord his God .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	7	David said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring me the holy vest. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	8	Then David asked the Lord , “ Should I chase the people who took our families ? Will I catch them ? ” The Lord answered , “ Chase them . You will catch them , and you will succeed in saving your families. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	9	David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine , where some of the men stayed .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	10	David and four hundred men kept up the chase . The other two hundred men stayed behind because they were too tired to cross the ravine .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	11	They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David . They gave the Egyptian some water to drink and some food to eat .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	12	And they gave him a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins . Then he felt better , because he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and nights .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	13	David asked him , “ Who is your master ? Where do you come from ? ” He answered , “ I ’ m an Egyptian , the slave of an Amalekite . Three days ago my master left me , because I was sick .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	14	We had raided the southern area of the Kerethites , the land of Judah , and the southern area of Caleb . We burned Ziklag , as well. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	15	David asked him , “ Can you lead me to the people who took our families ? ” He answered , “ Yes , if you promise me before God that you won ’ t kill me or give me back to my master . Then I will take you to them. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	16	So the Egyptian led David to the Amalekites . They were lying around on the ground , eating and drinking and celebrating with the things they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	17	David fought them from sunset until the evening of the next day . None of them escaped , except four hundred young men who rode off on their camels .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	18	David got his two wives back and everything the Amalekites had taken .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	19	Nothing was missing . David brought back everyone , young and old , sons and daughters . He recovered the valuable things and everything the Amalekites had taken .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	20	David took all the sheep and cattle , and his men made these animals go in front , saying , “ They are David ’ s prize. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	21	Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too tired to follow him , who had stayed at the Besor Ravine . They came out to meet David and the people with him . When he came near , David greeted the men at the ravine .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	22	But the evil men and troublemakers among those who followed David said , “ Since these two hundred men didn ’ t go with us , we shouldn ’ t give them any of the things we recovered . Just let each man take his wife and children and go. ”
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	23	David answered , “ No , my brothers . Don ’ t do that after what the Lord has given us . He has protected us and given us the enemy who attacked us .
NCV	1%20Samuel	30	24	Who will listen to what you say ? The share will be the same for the one who stayed with the supplies as for the one who went into battle . All will share alike. ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	1	20	Don ’ t tell it in Gath . Don ’ t announce it in the streets of Ashkelon . If you do , the Philistine women will be happy . The daughters of the Philistines will rejoice .
NCV	2%20Samuel	1	21	“ May there be no dew or rain on the mountains of Gilboa , and may their fields produce no grain , because there the mighty warrior ’ s shield was dishonored . Saul ’ s shield will no longer be rubbed with oil .

NCV	2%20Samuel	2	14	Abner said to Joab , “ Let the young men have a contest here. ” Joab said , “ Yes , let them have a contest. ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	2	16	Each man grabbed the one opposite him by the head and stabbed him in the side with a knife . So the men fell down together . For that reason , that place in Gibeon is called the Field of Knives .
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	17	That day there was a terrible battle , and David ’ s men defeated Abner and the Israelites . Abner Kills Asahel

NCV	2%20Samuel	2	20	Abner looked back and asked , “ Is that you , Asahel ? ” Asahel said , “ Yes , it is. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	21	Then Abner said to Asahel , “ Turn to your right or left and catch one of the young men and take his armor. ” But Asahel refused to stop chasing him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	22	Abner again said to Asahel , “ Stop chasing me ! If you don ’ t stop , I ’ ll have to kill you ! Then I won ’ t be able to face your brother Joab again ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	23	But Asahel refused to stop chasing Abner . So using the back end of his spear , Abner stabbed Asahel in the stomach , and the spear came out of his back . Asahel died right there , and everyone stopped when they came to the place where Asahel ’ s body lay .
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	24	But Joab and Abishai continued chasing Abner . As the sun was going down , they arrived at the hill of Ammah , near Giah on the way to the desert near Gibeon .
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	25	The men of Benjamin came to Abner , and all stood together at the top of the hill .
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	26	Abner shouted to Joab , “ Must the sword kill forever ? Surely you must know this will only end in sadness ! Tell the people to stop chasing their own brothers ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	27	Then Joab said , “ As surely as God lives , if you had not said anything , the people would have chased their brothers until morning. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	28	Then Joab blew a trumpet , and his people stopped chasing the Israelites . They did not fight them anymore .
NCV	2%20Samuel	2	29	Abner and his men marched all night through the Jordan Valley . They crossed the Jordan River , and after marching all day , arrived at Mahanaim .

NCV	2%20Samuel	3	7	Saul once had a slave woman named Rizpah , who was the daughter of Aiah . Ish-Bosheth said to Abner , “ Why did you have sexual relations with my father ’ s slave woman ? ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	11	2	One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof [ a ] of his palace . While he was on the roof , he saw a woman bathing . She was very beautiful .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	11	Uriah said to him , “ The Ark and the soldiers of Israel and Judah are staying in tents . My master Joab and his officers are camping out in the fields . It isn ’ t right for me to go home to eat and drink and have sexual relations with my wife ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	3	So David sent his servants to find out who she was . A servant answered , “ That woman is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam . She is the wife of Uriah the Hittite. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	4	So David sent messengers to bring Bathsheba to him . When she came to him , he had sexual relations with her . ( Now Bathsheba had purified herself from her monthly period . ) Then she went back to her house .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	5	But Bathsheba became pregnant and sent word to David , saying , “ I am pregnant. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	6	So David sent a message to Joab : “ Send Uriah the Hittite to me. ” And Joab sent Uriah to David .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	7	When Uriah came to him , David asked him how Joab was , how the soldiers were , and how the war was going .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	8	Then David said to Uriah , “ Go home and rest. ” So Uriah left the palace , and the king sent a gift to him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah did not go home . Instead , he slept outside the door of the palace as all the king ’ s officers did .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	10	The officers told David , “ Uriah did not go home. ” Then David said to Uriah , “ You came from a long trip . Why didn ’ t you go home ? ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	12	David said to Uriah , “ Stay here today . Tomorrow I ’ ll send you back to the battle. ” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	13	Then David called Uriah to come to see him , so Uriah ate and drank with David . David made Uriah drunk , but he still did not go home . That evening Uriah again slept with the king ’ s officers .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	14	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	15	In the letter David wrote , “ Put Uriah on the front lines where the fighting is worst and leave him there alone . Let him be killed in battle. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	16	Joab watched the city and saw where its strongest defenders were and put Uriah there .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	17	When the men of the city came out to fight against Joab , some of David ’ s men were killed . And Uriah the Hittite was one of them .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	18	Then Joab sent David a complete account of the war .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	19	Joab told the messenger , “ Tell King David what happened in the war .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	20	After you finish , the king may be angry and ask , ‘ Why did you go so near the city to fight ? Didn ’ t you know they would shoot arrows from the city wall ?
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	21	Do you remember who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth ? [ b ] It was a woman on the city wall . She threw a large stone for grinding grain on Abimelech and killed him there in Thebez . Why did you go so near the wall ? ’ If King David asks that , tell him , ‘ Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	22	The messenger left and went to David and told him everything Joab had told him to say .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	23	The messenger told David , “ The men of Ammon were winning . They came out and attacked us in the field , but we fought them back to the city gate .
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	24	The archers on the city wall shot at your servants , and some of your men were killed . Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	11	25	David said to the messenger , “ Say this to Joab : ‘ Don ’ t be upset about this . The sword kills everyone the same . Make a stronger attack against the city and capture it. ’ Encourage Joab with these words. ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	12	2	The rich man had many sheep and cattle .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	12	You had sexual relations with Bathsheba in secret , but I will do this so all the people of Israel can see it. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	3	But the poor man had nothing except one little female lamb he had bought . The poor man fed the lamb , and it grew up with him and his children . It shared his food and drank from his cup and slept in his arms . The lamb was like a daughter to him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	4	“ Then a traveler stopped to visit the rich man . The rich man wanted to feed the traveler , but he didn ’ t want to take one of his own sheep or cattle . Instead , he took the lamb from the poor man and cooked it for his visitor. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	5	David became very angry at the rich man . He said to Nathan , “ As surely as the Lord lives , the man who did this should die !
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	6	He must pay for the lamb four times for doing such a thing . He had no mercy ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	7	Then Nathan said to David , “ You are the man ! This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I appointed you king of Israel and saved you from Saul .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave you his kingdom and his wives . And I made you king of Israel and Judah . And if that had not been enough , I would have given you even more .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	9	So why did you ignore the Lord ’ s command ? Why did you do what he says is wrong ? You killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and took his wife to be your wife !
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now there will always be people in your family who will die by a sword , because you did not respect me ; you took the wife of Uriah the Hittite for yourself ! ’
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	11	“ This is what the Lord says : ‘ I am bringing trouble to you from your own family . While you watch , I will take your wives from you and give them to someone who is very close to you . He will have sexual relations with your wives , and everyone will know it .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	13	Then David said to Nathan , “ I have sinned against the Lord. ” Nathan answered , “ The Lord has taken away your sin . You will not die .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	14	But what you did caused the Lord ’ s enemies to lose all respect for him . For this reason the son who was born to you will die. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	15	Then Nathan went home . And the Lord caused the son of David and Bathsheba , Uriah ’ s widow , to be very sick .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	16	David prayed to God for the baby . David fasted and went into his house and stayed there , lying on the ground all night .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	17	The elders of David ’ s family came to him and tried to pull him up from the ground , but he refused to get up or to eat food with them .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	18	On the seventh day the baby died . David ’ s servants were afraid to tell him that the baby was dead . They said , “ Look , we tried to talk to David while the baby was alive , but he refused to listen to us . If we tell him the baby is dead , he may do something awful. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	19	When David saw his servants whispering , he knew that the baby was dead . So he asked them , “ Is the baby dead ? ” They answered , “ Yes , he is dead. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David got up from the floor , washed himself , put lotions on , and changed his clothes . Then he went into the Lord ’ s house to worship . After that , he went home and asked for something to eat . His servants gave him some food , and he ate .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	21	David ’ s servants said to him , “ Why are you doing this ? When the baby was still alive , you fasted and you cried . Now that the baby is dead , you get up and eat food. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	22	David said , “ While the baby was still alive , I fasted , and I cried . I thought , ‘ Who knows ? Maybe the Lord will feel sorry for me and let the baby live. ’
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now that the baby is dead , why should I fast ? I can ’ t bring him back to life . Someday I will go to him , but he can not come back to me. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	24	Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife . He slept with her and had sexual relations with her . She became pregnant again and had another son , whom David named Solomon . The Lord loved Solomon .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	25	The Lord sent word through Nathan the prophet to name the baby Jedidiah , [ a ] because the Lord loved the child . David Captures Rabbah
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	26	Joab fought against Rabbah , a royal city of the Ammonites , and he was about to capture it .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	27	Joab sent messengers to David and said , “ I have fought against Rabbah and have captured its water supply .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	28	Now bring the other soldiers together and attack this city . Capture it before I capture it myself and it is called by my name ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	29	So David gathered all the army and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	30	David took the crown off their king ’ s head and had it placed on his own head . That gold crown weighed about seventy-five pounds , and it had valuable gems in it . And David took many valuable things from the city .
NCV	2%20Samuel	12	31	He also brought out the people of the city and forced them to work with saws , iron picks , and axes . He also made them build with bricks . David did this to all the Ammonite cities . Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem .

NCV	2%20Samuel	13	2	Tamar was a virgin . Amnon made himself sick just thinking about her , because he could not find any chance to be alone with her .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	13	I could never get rid of my shame ! And you will be like the shameful fools in Israel ! Please talk with the king , and he will let you marry me. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	3	Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother . Jonadab was a very clever man .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	4	He asked Amnon , “ Son of the king , why do you look so sad day after day ? Tell me what ’ s wrong ! ” Amnon told him , “ I love Tamar , the sister of my half-brother Absalom. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	5	Jonadab said to Amnon , “ Go to bed and act as if you are sick . Then your father will come to see you . Tell him , ‘ Please let my sister Tamar come in and give me food to eat . Let her make the food in front of me so I can watch and eat it from her hand. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon went to bed and acted sick . When King David came in to see him , Amnon said to him , “ Please let my sister Tamar come in . Let her make two of her special cakes for me while I watch . Then I will eat them from her hands. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	7	David sent for Tamar in the palace , saying , “ Go to your brother Amnon ’ s house and make some food for him. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon ’ s house , and he was in bed . Tamar took some dough and pressed it together with her hands . She made some special cakes while Amnon watched . Then she baked them .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	9	Next she took the pan and served him , but he refused to eat . He said to his servants , “ All of you , leave me alone ! ” So they all left him alone .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	10	Amnon said to Tamar , “ Bring the food into the bedroom so I may eat from your hand. ” Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	11	She went to him so he could eat from her hands , but Amnon grabbed her . He said , “ Sister , come and have sexual relations with me. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	12	Tamar said to him , “ No , brother ! Don ’ t force me ! This should never be done in Israel ! Don ’ t do this shameful thing !
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	14	But Amnon refused to listen to her . He was stronger than she was , so he forced her to have sexual relations with him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	15	After that , Amnon hated Tamar . He hated her more than he had loved her before . Amnon said to her , “ Get up and leave ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	16	Tamar said to him , “ No ! Sending me away would be worse than what you ’ ve already done ! ” But he refused to listen to her .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	17	He called his young servant back in and said , “ Get this woman out of here and away from me ! Lock the door after her. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	18	So his servant led her out of the room and bolted the door after her . Tamar was wearing a special robe with long sleeves , because the king ’ s virgin daughters wore this kind of robe .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	19	To show how upset she was , Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her special robe and put her hand on her head . Then she went away , crying loudly .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	20	Absalom , Tamar ’ s brother , said to her , “ Has Amnon , your brother , forced you to have sexual relations with him ? For now , sister , be quiet . He is your half-brother . Don ’ t let this upset you so much ! ” So Tamar lived in her brother Absalom ’ s house and was sad and lonely .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	21	When King David heard the news , he was very angry .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	22	Absalom did not say a word , good or bad , to Amnon . But he hated Amnon for disgracing his sister Tamar . Absalom ’ s Revenge
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	23	Two years later Absalom had some men come to Baal Hazor , near Ephraim , to cut the wool from his sheep . Absalom invited all the king ’ s sons to come also .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	24	Absalom went to the king and said , “ I have men coming to cut the wool . Please come with your officers and join me. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	25	King David said to Absalom , “ No , my son . We won ’ t all go , because it would be too much trouble for you. ” Although Absalom begged David , he would not go , but he did give his blessing .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	26	Absalom said , “ If you don ’ t want to come , then please let my brother Amnon come with us. ” King David asked , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	27	Absalom kept begging David until he let Amnon and all the king ’ s sons go with Absalom .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	28	Then Absalom instructed his servants , “ Watch Amnon . When he is drunk , I will tell you , ‘ Kill Amnon. ’ Right then , kill him ! Don ’ t be afraid , because I have commanded you ! Be strong and brave ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	29	So Absalom ’ s young men killed Amnon as Absalom commanded , but all of David ’ s other sons got on their mules and escaped .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	30	While the king ’ s sons were on their way , the news came to David , “ Absalom has killed all of the king ’ s sons ! Not one of them is left alive ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	31	King David tore his clothes and lay on the ground to show his sadness . All his servants standing nearby tore their clothes also .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	32	Jonadab son of Shimeah , David ’ s brother , said to David , “ Don ’ t think all the young men , your sons , are killed . No , only Amnon is dead ! Absalom has planned this ever since Amnon forced his sister Tamar to have sexual relations with him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	33	My master and king , don ’ t think that all of the king ’ s sons are dead . Only Amnon is dead ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	34	In the meantime Absalom had run away . A guard standing on the city wall saw many people coming from the other side of the hill .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	35	So Jonadab said to King David , “ Look , I was right ! The king ’ s sons are coming ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	36	As soon as Jonadab had said this , the king ’ s sons arrived , crying loudly . David and all his servants began crying also .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	37	David cried for his son every day . But Absalom ran away to Talmai [ a ] son of Ammihud , the king of Geshur .
NCV	2%20Samuel	13	38	After Absalom ran away to Geshur , he stayed there for three years .

NCV	2%20Samuel	14	2	So Joab sent messengers to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there . He said to her , “ Pretend to be very sad . Put on funeral clothes and don ’ t put lotion on yourself . Act like a woman who has been crying many days for someone who died .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	14	We will all die someday . We ’ re like water spilled on the ground ; no one can gather it back . But God doesn ’ t take away life . Instead , he plans ways that those who have been sent away will not have to stay away from him !
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	3	Then go to the king and say these words. ” Then Joab told her what to say .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	4	So the woman from Tekoa spoke to the king . She bowed facedown on the ground to show respect and said , “ My king , help me ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	5	King David asked her , “ What is the matter ? ” The woman said , “ I am a widow ; my husband is dead .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	6	I had two sons . They were out in the field fighting , and no one was there to stop them . So one son killed the other son .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	7	Now all the family group is against me . They said to me , ‘ Bring the son who killed his brother so we may kill him for killing his brother . That way we will also get rid of the one who would receive what belonged to his father. ’ My son is like the last spark of a fire . He is all I have left . If they kill him , my husband ’ s name and property will be gone from the earth. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	8	Then the king said to the woman , “ Go home . I will take care of this for you. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	9	The woman of Tekoa said to him , “ Let the blame be on me and my father ’ s family . My master and king , you and your throne are innocent. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	10	King David said , “ Bring me anyone who says anything bad to you . Then he won ’ t bother you again. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	11	The woman said , “ Please promise in the name of the Lord your God . Then my relative who has the duty of punishing a murderer won ’ t add to the destruction by killing my son. ” David said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , no one will hurt your son . Not one hair from his head will fall to the ground. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	12	The woman said , “ Let me say something to you , my master and king. ” The king said , “ Speak. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	13	Then the woman said , “ Why have you decided this way against the people of God ? When you judge this way , you show that you are guilty for not bringing back your son who was forced to leave home .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	15	My master and king , I came to say this to you because the people have made me afraid ! I thought , ‘ Let me talk to the king . Maybe he will do what I ask .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	16	Maybe he will listen . Perhaps he will save me from those who want to keep both me and my son from getting what God gave us. ’
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	17	“ Now I say , ‘ May the words of my master the king give me rest . Like an angel of God , you know what is good and what is bad . May the Lord your God be with you ! ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	18	Then King David said , “ Do not hide the truth . Answer me one question. ” The woman said , “ My master the king , please ask your question. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	19	The king said , “ Did Joab tell you to say all these things ? ” The woman answered , “ As you live , my master the king , no one could avoid that question . You are right . Your servant Joab did tell me to say these things .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	20	Joab did it so you would see things differently . My master , you are wise like an angel of God who knows everything that happens on earth. ” Absalom Returns to Jerusalem
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	21	The king said to Joab , “ Look , I will do what I promised . Bring back the young man Absalom. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	22	Joab bowed facedown on the ground and blessed the king . Then he said , “ Today I know you are pleased with me , because you have done what I asked. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	23	Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	24	But King David said , “ Absalom must go to his own house . He may not come to see me. ” So Absalom went to his own house and did not go to see the king .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	25	Absalom was greatly praised for his handsome appearance . No man in Israel was as handsome as he . No blemish was on him from his head to his foot .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	26	At the end of every year , Absalom would cut his hair , because it became too heavy . When he weighed it , it would weigh about five pounds by the royal measure .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	27	Absalom had three sons and one daughter . His daughter ’ s name was also Tamar , and she was a beautiful woman .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two full years without seeing King David .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	29	Then Absalom sent for Joab so he could send him to the king , but Joab would not come . Absalom sent a message a second time , but Joab still refused to come .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	30	Then Absalom said to his servants , “ Look , Joab ’ s field is next to mine , and he has barley growing there . Go burn it. ” So Absalom ’ s servants set fire to Joab ’ s field .
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Joab went to Absalom ’ s house and said to him , “ Why did your servants burn my field ? ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	32	Absalom said to Joab , “ I sent a message to you , asking you to come here . I wanted to send you to the king to ask him why he brought me home from Geshur . It would have been better for me to stay there ! Now let me see the king . If I have sinned , he can put me to death ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	14	33	So Joab went to the king and told him Absalom ’ s words . Then the king called for Absalom . Absalom came and bowed facedown on the ground before the king , and the king kissed him . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Samuel	15	2	Absalom would get up early and stand near the city gate . [ a ] Anyone who had a problem for the king to settle would come here . When someone came , Absalom would call out and say , “ What city are you from ? ” The person would answer , “ I ’ m from one of the tribes of Israel. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	15	The king ’ s officers said to him , “ We will do anything you say. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	3	Then Absalom would say , “ Look , your claims are right , but the king has no one to listen to you. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	4	Absalom would also say , “ I wish someone would make me judge in this land ! Then people with problems could come to me , and I could help them get justice. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	5	People would come near Absalom to bow to him . When they did , Absalom would reach out his hand and take hold of them and kiss them .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	6	Absalom did that to all the Israelites who came to King David for decisions . In this way , Absalom stole the hearts of all Israel .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	7	After four years Absalom said to King David , “ Please let me go to Hebron . I want to carry out my promise that I made to the Lord
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	8	while I was living in Geshur in Aram . I said , ‘ If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem , I will worship him in Hebron. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	9	The king said , “ Go in peace. ” So Absalom went to Hebron .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	10	But he sent secret messengers through all the tribes of Israel . They told the people , “ When you hear the trumpets , say this : ‘ Absalom is the king at Hebron ! ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	11	Absalom had invited two hundred men to go with him . So they went from Jerusalem with him , but they didn ’ t know what he was planning .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	12	While Absalom was offering sacrifices , he sent for Ahithophel , one of the people who advised David , to come from his hometown of Giloh . So Absalom ’ s plans were working very well . More and more people began to support him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	13	A messenger came to David , saying , “ The Israelites are giving their loyalty to Absalom. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	14	Then David said to all his officers who were with him in Jerusalem , “ We must leave quickly ! If we don ’ t , we won ’ t be able to get away from Absalom . We must hurry before he catches us and destroys us and kills the people of Jerusalem. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	16	The king set out with everyone in his house , but he left ten slave women to take care of the palace .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	17	The king left with all his people following him , and they stopped at a house far away .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	18	All the king ’ s servants passed by him—the Kerethites and Pelethites , [ b ] all those from Gath , and the six hundred men who had followed him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	15	19	The king said to Ittai , a man from Gath , “ Why are you also going with us ? Turn back and stay with King Absalom because you are a foreigner . This is not your homeland .

NCV	2%20Samuel	16	16	David ’ s friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom and said to him , “ Long live the king ! Long live the king ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	16	3	The king asked , “ Where is Mephibosheth ? ” Ziba answered him , “ Mephibosheth is staying in Jerusalem because he thinks , ‘ Today the Israelites will give my father ’ s kingdom back to me ! ’ ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	16	10	But the king answered , “ This does not concern you , sons of Zeruiah ! If he is cursing me because the Lord told him to , who can question him ? ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	16	12	Maybe the Lord will see my misery and repay me with something good for Shimei ’ s curses today ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men went on down the road , but Shimei followed on the nearby hillside . He kept cursing David and throwing stones and dirt at him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	16	14	When the king and all his people arrived at the Jordan , they were very tired , so they rested there .

NCV	2%20Samuel	16	21	Ahithophel said , “ Your father left behind some of his slave women to take care of the palace . Have sexual relations with them . Then all Israel will hear that your father is your enemy , and all your people will be encouraged to give you more support. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they put up a tent for Absalom on the roof [ a ] of the palace where everyone in Israel could see it . And Absalom had sexual relations with his father ’ s slave women .
NCV	2%20Samuel	16	23	At that time people thought Ahithophel ’ s advice was as reliable as God ’ s own word . Both David and Absalom thought it was that reliable .

NCV	2%20Samuel	17	5	But Absalom said , “ Now call Hushai the Arkite , so I can hear what he says. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	6	When Hushai came to Absalom , Absalom said to him , “ This is the plan Ahithophel gave . Should we follow it ? If not , tell us. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	7	Hushai said to Absalom , “ Ahithophel ’ s advice is not good this time. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	8	Hushai added , “ You know your father and his men are strong . They are as angry as a bear that is robbed of its cubs . Your father is a skilled fighter . He won ’ t stay all night with the army .
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	9	He is probably already hiding in a cave or some other place . If the first attack fails , people will hear the news and think , ‘ Absalom ’ s followers are losing ! ’
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	10	Then even the men who are as brave as lions will be frightened , because all the Israelites know your father is a fighter . They know his men are brave !
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	11	“ This is what I suggest : Gather all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba . [ a ] There will be as many people as grains of sand by the sea . Then you yourself must go into the battle .

NCV	2%20Samuel	17	15	Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar , the priests , what Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the elders of Israel . He also reported to them what he himself had suggested . Hushai said ,
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	16	“ Quickly ! Send a message to David . Tell him not to stay tonight at the crossings into the desert but to cross over the Jordan River at once . If he crosses the river , he and all his people won ’ t be destroyed. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a boy saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom . So Jonathan and Ahimaaz left quickly and went to a man ’ s house in Bahurim . He had a well in his courtyard , and they climbed down into it .
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	19	The man ’ s wife spread a sheet over the opening of the well and covered it with grain . No one could tell that anyone was hiding there .
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	20	Absalom ’ s servants came to the woman at the house and asked , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” She said to them , “ They have already crossed the brook. ” Absalom ’ s servants then went to look for Jonathan and Ahimaaz , but they could not find them . So they went back to Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Samuel	17	21	After Absalom ’ s servants left , Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well and went to tell King David . They said , “ Hurry , cross over the river ! Ahithophel has said these things against you ! ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	18	18	When Absalom was alive , he had set up a pillar for himself in the King ’ s Valley . He said , “ I have no son to keep my name alive. ” So he named the pillar after himself , and it is called Absalom ’ s Monument even today .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	3	But the men said , “ You must not go with us ! If we run away in the battle , Absalom ’ s men won ’ t care . Even if half of us are killed , Absalom ’ s men won ’ t care . But you ’ re worth ten thousand of us ! You can help us most by staying in the city. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	4	The king said to his people , “ I will do what you think is best. ” So the king stood at the side of the gate as the army went out in groups of a hundred and a thousand .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	5	The king commanded Joab , Abishai , and Ittai , “ Be gentle with young Absalom for my sake. ” Everyone heard the king ’ s orders to the commanders about Absalom .

NCV	2%20Samuel	18	10	When one of the men saw it happen , he told Joab , “ I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	11	Joab said to him , “ You saw him ? Why didn ’ t you kill him and let him fall to the ground ? I would have given you a belt and four ounces of silver ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	12	The man answered , “ I wouldn ’ t touch the king ’ s son even if you gave me twenty-five pounds of silver . We heard the king command you , Abishai , and Ittai , ‘ Be careful not to hurt young Absalom. ’
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	13	If I had killed him , the king would have found out , and you would not have protected me ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	14	Joab said , “ I won ’ t waste time here with you ! ” Absalom was still alive in the oak tree , so Joab took three spears and stabbed him in the heart .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	15	Ten young men who carried Joab ’ s armor also gathered around Absalom and struck him and killed him .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	16	Then Joab blew the trumpet , so the troops stopped chasing the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	17	Then Joab ’ s men took Absalom ’ s body and threw it into a large pit in the forest and filled the pit with many stones . All the Israelites ran away to their homes .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	19	Ahimaaz son of Zadok said to Joab , “ Let me run and take the news to King David . I ’ ll tell him the Lord has saved him from his enemies. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	20	Joab answered Ahimaaz , “ No , you are not the one to take the news today . You may do it another time , but do not take it today , because the king ’ s son is dead. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to a man from Cush , “ Go , tell the king what you have seen. ” The Cushite bowed to Joab and ran to tell David .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	22	But Ahimaaz son of Zadok begged Joab again , “ No matter what happens , please let me go along with the Cushite ! ” Joab said , “ Son , why do you want to carry the news ? You won ’ t get any reward. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	23	Ahimaaz answered , “ No matter what happens , I will run. ” So Joab said to Ahimaaz , “ Run ! ” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the Jordan Valley and passed the Cushite .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	24	David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city . The watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the walls , and as he looked up , he saw a man running alone .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	25	He shouted the news to the king . The king said , “ If he is alone , he is bringing good news ! ” The man came nearer and nearer to the city .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	26	Then the watchman saw another man running , and he called to the gatekeeper , “ Look ! Another man is running alone ! ” The king said , “ He is also bringing good news ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	27	The watchman said , “ I think the first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok. ” The king said , “ Ahimaaz is a good man . He must be bringing good news ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	28	Then Ahimaaz called a greeting to the king . He bowed facedown on the ground before the king and said , “ Praise the Lord your God ! The Lord has defeated those who were against you , my king. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	29	The king asked , “ Is young Absalom all right ? ” Ahimaaz answered , “ When Joab sent me , I saw some great excitement , but I don ’ t know what it was. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	30	The king said , “ Step over here and wait. ” So Ahimaaz stepped aside and stood there .
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	31	Then the Cushite arrived . He said , “ Master and king , hear the good news ! Today the Lord has punished those who were against you ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	32	The king asked the Cushite , “ Is young Absalom all right ? ” The Cushite answered , “ May your enemies and all who come to hurt you be like that young man ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	18	33	Then the king was very upset , and he went to the room over the city gate and cried . As he went , he cried out , “ My son Absalom , my son Absalom ! I wish I had died and not you . Absalom , my son , my son ! ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Samuel	19	5	Joab went into the king ’ s house and said , “ Today you have shamed all your men . They saved your life and the lives of your sons , daughters , wives , and slave women .
NCV	2%20Samuel	19	6	You have shamed them because you love those who hate you , and you hate those who love you . Today you have made it clear that your commanders and men mean nothing to you . What if Absalom had lived and all of us were dead ? I can see you would be pleased .

NCV	2%20Samuel	19	27	But he lied about me to you . You , my master and king , are like an angel from God . Do what you think is good .
NCV	2%20Samuel	19	28	You could have killed all my grandfather ’ s family . Instead , you put me with those people who eat at your own table . So I don ’ t have a right to ask anything more from the king ! ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	20	11	One of Joab ’ s young men stood by Amasa ’ s body and said , “ Everyone who is for Joab and David should follow Joab ! ”

NCV	2%20Samuel	20	18	Then the woman said , “ In the past people would say , ‘ Ask for advice at Abel , ’ and the problem would be solved .
NCV	2%20Samuel	20	19	I am one of the peaceful , loyal people of Israel . You are trying to destroy an important city of Israel . Why must you destroy what belongs to the Lord ? ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	20	21	That is not what I want . But there is a man here from the mountains of Ephraim , who is named Sheba son of Bicri . He has turned against King David . If you bring him to me , I will leave the city alone. ” The woman said to Joab , “ His head will be thrown over the wall to you. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman spoke very wisely to all the people of the city . They cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and threw it over the wall to Joab . So he blew the trumpet , and the army left the city . Every man returned home , and Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem .

NCV	2%20Samuel	24	2	So King David said to Joab , the commander of the army , “ Go through all the tribes of Israel , from Dan to Beersheba , [ a ] and count the people . Then I will know how many there are. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	24	But the king answered Araunah , “ No , I will pay you for the land . I won ’ t offer to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing. ” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for one and one-fourth pounds of silver .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	3	But Joab said to the king , “ May the Lord your God give you a hundred times more people , and may my master the king live to see this happen . Why do you want to do this ? ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	4	But the king commanded Joab and the commanders of the army , so they left the king to count the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	5	After crossing the Jordan River , they camped near Aroer on the south side of the city in the ravine . They went through Gad and on to Jazer .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	6	Then they went to Gilead and the land of Tahtim Hodshi and to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	7	They went to the strong , walled city of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites . Finally , they went to southern Judah , to Beersheba .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	8	After nine months and twenty days , they had gone through all the land . Then they came back to Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	9	Joab gave the list of the people to the king . There were eight hundred thousand men in Israel who could use the sword and five hundred thousand men in Judah .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	10	David felt ashamed after he had counted the people . He said to the Lord , “ I have sinned greatly by what I have done . Lord , I beg you to forgive me , your servant , because I have been very foolish. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	11	When David got up in the morning , the Lord spoke his word to Gad , who was a prophet and David ’ s seer .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	12	The Lord told Gad , “ Go and tell David , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I offer you three choices . Choose one of them and I will do it to you. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad went to David and said to him , “ Should three years of hunger come to you and your land ? Or should your enemies chase you for three months ? Or should there be three days of disease in your land ? Think about it . Then decide which of these things I should tell the Lord who sent me. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	14	David said to Gad , “ I am in great trouble . Let the Lord punish us , because the Lord is very merciful . Don ’ t let my punishment come from human beings ! ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	15	So the Lord sent a terrible disease on Israel . It began in the morning and continued until the chosen time to stop . From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand people died .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	16	When the angel raised his arm toward Jerusalem to destroy it , the Lord felt very sorry about the terrible things that had happened . He said to the angel who was destroying the people , “ That is enough ! Put down your arm ! ” The angel of the Lord was then by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	17	When David saw the angel that killed the people , he said to the Lord , “ I am the one who sinned and did wrong . These people only followed me like sheep . They did nothing wrong . Please punish me and my family. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	18	That day Gad came to David and said , “ Go and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David did what Gad told him to do , just as the Lord commanded .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	20	Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming to him . So he went out and bowed facedown on the ground before the king .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	21	He said , “ Why has my master the king come to me ? ” David answered , “ To buy the threshing floor from you so I can build an altar to the Lord . Then the terrible disease will stop. ”
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	22	Araunah said to David , “ My master and king , you may take anything you want for a sacrifice . Here are some oxen for the whole burnt offering and the threshing boards and the yokes for the wood .
NCV	2%20Samuel	24	23	My king , I give everything to you. ” Araunah also said to the king , “ May the Lord your God be pleased with you. ”

NCV	1%20Kings	1	9	Then Adonijah killed some sheep , cows , and fat calves for sacrifices at the Stone of Zoheleth near the spring of Rogel . He invited all his brothers , the other sons of King David , to come , as well as all the men of Judah .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	10	But Adonijah did not invite Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , his father ’ s special guard , or his brother Solomon .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	11	When Nathan heard about this , he went to Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother . “ Have you heard that Adonijah , Haggith ’ s son , has made himself king ? ” Nathan asked . “ Our real king , David , does not know it .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	12	I strongly advise you to save yourself and your sons .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	13	Go to King David and tell him , ‘ My master and king , you promised that my son Solomon would be king and would rule on your throne after you . Why then has Adonijah become king ? ’
NCV	1%20Kings	1	14	While you are still talking to the king , I will come in and tell him that what you have said about Adonijah is true. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went in to see the aged king in his bedroom , where Abishag , the girl from Shunam , was caring for him .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed and knelt before the king . He asked , “ What do you want ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	17	She answered , “ My master , you made a promise to me in the name of the Lord your God . You said , ‘ Your son Solomon will become king after me , and he will rule on my throne. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	1	18	But now , unknown to you , Adonijah has become king .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	19	He has killed many cows , fat calves , and sheep for sacrifices . And he has invited all your sons , as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army , but he did not invite Solomon , who serves you .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	20	My master and king , all the Israelites are watching you , waiting for you to decide who will be king after you .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	21	As soon as you die , Solomon and I will be treated as criminals. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	22	While Bathsheba was still talking with the king , Nathan the prophet arrived .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	23	The servants told the king , “ Nathan the prophet is here. ” So Nathan went to the king and bowed facedown on the ground before him .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	24	Nathan said , “ My master and king , have you said that Adonijah will be the king after you and that he will rule on your throne ?
NCV	1%20Kings	1	25	Today he has sacrificed many cows , fat calves , and sheep , and he has invited all your other sons , the commanders of the army , and Abiathar the priest . Right now they are eating and drinking with him . They are saying , ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! ’
NCV	1%20Kings	1	26	But he did not invite me , your own servant , or Zadok the priest , or Benaiah son of Jehoiada , or your son Solomon .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	27	Did you do this ? Since we are your servants , why didn ’ t you tell us who should be king after you ? ” David Makes Solomon King
NCV	1%20Kings	1	28	Then the king said , “ Tell Bathsheba to come in ! ” So she came in and stood before the king .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	29	Then the king made this promise , “ The Lord has saved me from all trouble . As surely as he lives ,
NCV	1%20Kings	1	30	I will do today what I have promised you in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel . I promised that your son Solomon would be king after me and rule on my throne in my place. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed facedown on the ground and knelt before the king and said , “ Long live my master King David ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	32	Then King David said , “ Tell Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah son of Jehoiada to come in. ” When they came before the king ,
NCV	1%20Kings	1	33	he said to them , “ Take my servants with you and put my son Solomon on my own mule . Take him down to the spring called Gihon .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	34	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet should pour olive oil on him and make him king over Israel . Blow the trumpet and shout , ‘ Long live King Solomon ! ’
NCV	1%20Kings	1	35	Then come back up here with him . He will sit on my throne and rule in my place , because he is the one I have chosen to be the ruler over Israel and Judah. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king , “ Amen ! This is what the Lord , the God of my master , has declared !
NCV	1%20Kings	1	37	The Lord has always helped you , our king . May he also help Solomon and make King Solomon ’ s throne an even greater throne than yours. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah son of Jehoiada left with the Kerethites and Pelethites . [ a ] They put Solomon on King David ’ s mule and took him to the spring called Gihon .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	39	Zadok the priest took the container of olive oil from the Holy Tent and poured the oil on Solomon ’ s head to show he was the king . Then they blew the trumpet , and all the people shouted , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	40	All the people followed Solomon into the city . Playing flutes and shouting for joy , they made so much noise the ground shook .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	41	At this time Adonijah and all the guests with him were finishing their meal . When he heard the sound from the trumpet , Joab asked , “ What does all that noise from the city mean ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	42	While Joab was speaking , Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived . Adonijah said , “ Come in ! You are an important man , so you must be bringing good news. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	43	But Jonathan answered , “ No ! Our master King David has made Solomon the new king .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	44	King David sent Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and all the king ’ s bodyguards with him , and they have put Solomon on the king ’ s own mule .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	45	Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet poured olive oil on Solomon at Gihon to make him king . After that they went into the city , shouting with joy . Now the whole city is excited , and that is the noise you hear .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	46	Solomon has now become the king .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	47	All the king ’ s officers have come to tell King David that he has done a good thing . They are saying , ‘ May your God make Solomon even more famous than you and an even greater king than you. ’ ” Jonathan continued , “ And King David bowed down on his bed to worship God ,
NCV	1%20Kings	1	48	saying , ‘ Bless the Lord , the God of Israel . Today he has made one of my sons the king and allowed me to see it. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	49	Then all of Adonijah ’ s guests were afraid , and they left quickly and scattered .
NCV	1%20Kings	1	50	Adonijah was also afraid of Solomon , so he went and took hold of the corners of the altar . [ b ]
NCV	1%20Kings	1	51	Then someone told Solomon , “ Adonijah is afraid of you , so he is at the altar , holding on to its corners . He says , ‘ Tell King Solomon to promise me today that he will not kill me. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	52	So Solomon answered , “ Adonijah must show that he is a man of honor . If he does that , I promise he will not lose even a single hair from his head . But if he does anything wrong , he will die. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	1	53	Then King Solomon sent some men to get Adonijah . When he was brought from the altar , he came before King Solomon and bowed down . Solomon told him , “ Go home. ” Footnotes - 1:38 Kerethites and Pelethites These were probably special units of the army that were responsible for the king ’ s safety , a kind of palace guard . - 1:50 corners of the altar If a person were innocent of a crime , he could run into the Holy Place where the altar was .

NCV	1%20Kings	2	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	2	2	David said , “ My time to die is near . Be a good and strong leader .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	3	Obey the Lord your God . Follow him by obeying his demands , his commands , his laws , and his rules that are written in the teachings of Moses . If you do these things , you will be successful in all you do and wherever you go .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	4	And if you obey the Lord , he will keep the promise he made to me . He said : ‘ If your descendants live as I tell them and have complete faith in me , a man from your family will always be king over the people of Israel. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	2	5	“ Also , you remember what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me . He killed the two commanders of Israel ’ s armies : Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether . He did this as if he and they were at war , although it was a time of peace . He put their blood on the belt around his waist and on his sandals on his feet .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	6	Punish him in the way you think is wisest , but do not let him die peacefully of old age .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	7	“ Be kind to the children of Barzillai of Gilead , and allow them to eat at your table . They welcomed me when I ran away from your brother Absalom .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	8	“ And remember , Shimei son of Gera , the Benjaminite , is here with you . He cursed me the day I went to Mahanaim . But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan River , I promised him before the Lord , ‘ Shimei , I will not kill you. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	2	9	But you should not leave him unpunished . You are a wise man , and you will know what to do to him , but you must be sure he is killed. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	10	Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	11	He had ruled over Israel forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem . Solomon Takes Control as King
NCV	1%20Kings	2	12	Solomon became king after David , his father , and he was in firm control of his kingdom .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	13	At this time Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba , Solomon ’ s mother . “ Do you come in peace ? ” Bathsheba asked . “ Yes . This is a peaceful visit , ” Adonijah answered .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	14	“ I have something to say to you. ” “ You may speak , ” she said .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	15	“ You remember that at one time the kingdom was mine , ” Adonijah said . “ All the people of Israel recognized me as their king , but things have changed . Now my brother is the king , because the Lord chose him .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	16	Now I have one thing to ask you ; please do not refuse me. ” Bathsheba answered , “ What do you want ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	17	“ I know King Solomon will do anything you ask him , ” Adonijah continued . “ Please ask him to give me Abishag the Shunammite to be my wife. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	18	“ Very well , ” she answered . “ I will speak to the king for you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah . When Solomon saw her , he stood up to meet her , then bowed down , and sat on the throne . He told some servants to bring another throne for his mother . Then she sat down at his right side .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	20	Bathsheba said , “ I have one small thing to ask you . Please do not refuse me. ” “ Ask , mother , ” the king answered . “ I will not refuse you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	21	So she said , “ Allow Abishag the Shunammite to marry your brother Adonijah. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother , “ Why do you ask me to give him Abishag ? Why don ’ t you also ask for him to become the king since he is my older brother ? Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah would support him ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Solomon swore by the name of the Lord , saying , “ May God punish me terribly if this doesn ’ t cost Adonijah his life !
NCV	1%20Kings	2	24	By the Lord who has given me the throne that belonged to my father David and who has kept his promise and given the kingdom to me and my people , Adonijah will die today ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	25	Then King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and he went and killed Adonijah .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	26	King Solomon said to Abiathar the priest , “ I should kill you too , but I will allow you to go back to your fields in Anathoth . I will not kill you at this time , because you helped carry the Ark of the Lord God while marching with my father David . And I know you shared in all the hard times with him. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	27	Then Solomon removed Abiathar from being the Lord ’ s priest . This happened as the Lord had said it would , when he was speaking in Shiloh about the priest Eli and his descendants .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	28	When Joab heard about what had happened , he was afraid . He had supported Adonijah but not Absalom . So Joab ran to the Tent of the Lord and took hold of the corners of the altar . [ a ]
NCV	1%20Kings	2	29	Someone told King Solomon that Joab had run to the Tent of the Lord and was beside the altar . Then Solomon ordered Benaiah to go and kill him .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	30	Benaiah went into the Tent of the Lord and said to Joab , “ The king says , ‘ Come out ! ’ ” But Joab answered , “ No , I will die here. ” So Benaiah went back to the king and told him what Joab had said .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	31	Then the king ordered Benaiah , “ Do as he says ! Kill him there and bury him . Then my family and I will be free of the guilt of Joab , who has killed innocent people .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	32	Without my father knowing it , he killed two men who were much better than he was—Abner son of Ner , the commander of Israel ’ s army , and Amasa son of Jether , the commander of Judah ’ s army . So the Lord will pay him back for those deaths .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	33	Joab and his family will be forever guilty for their deaths , but there will be peace from the Lord for David , his descendants , his family , and his throne forever. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada killed Joab , and he was buried near his home in the desert .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	35	The king then made Benaiah son of Jehoiada commander of the army in Joab ’ s place . He also made Zadok the new high priest in Abiathar ’ s place .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	36	Next the king sent for Shimei . Solomon said to him , “ Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there . Don ’ t leave the city .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	37	The very day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley , someone will kill you , and it will be your own fault. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	38	So Shimei answered the king , “ I agree with what you say . I will do what you say , my master and king. ” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	39	But three years later two of Shimei ’ s slaves ran away to Achish king of Gath , who was the son of Maacah . Shimei heard that his slaves were in Gath ,
NCV	1%20Kings	2	40	so he put his saddle on his donkey and went to Achish at Gath to find them . Then he brought them back from Gath .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	41	Someone told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	42	So Solomon sent for Shimei and said , “ I made you promise in the name of the Lord not to leave Jerusalem . I warned you if you went out anywhere you would die , and you agreed to what I said .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	43	Why did you break your promise to the Lord and disobey my command ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	44	The king also said , “ You know the many wrong things you did to my father David , so now the Lord will punish you for those wrongs .
NCV	1%20Kings	2	45	But the Lord will bless me and make the rule of David safe before the Lord forever. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	2	46	Then the king ordered Benaiah to kill Shimei , and he did . Now Solomon was in full control of his kingdom .

NCV	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	3	3	Solomon showed he loved the Lord by following the commands his father David had given him , except many other places of worship were still used to offer sacrifices and to burn incense .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	2	The Temple for the worship of the Lord had not yet been finished , so people were still sacrificing at altars in many places of worship .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	4	King Solomon went to Gibeon to offer a sacrifice , because it was the most important place of worship . He offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	5	While he was at Gibeon , the Lord appeared to him in a dream during the night . God said , “ Ask for whatever you want me to give you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon answered , “ You were very kind to your servant , my father David . He obeyed you , and he was honest and lived right . You showed great kindness to him when you allowed his son to be king after him .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	7	Lord my God , now you have made me , your servant , king in my father ’ s place . But I am like a little child ; I don ’ t know how to do what must be done .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	8	I , your servant , am here among your chosen people , and there are too many of them to count .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	9	I ask that you give me a heart that understands , so I can rule the people in the right way and will know the difference between right and wrong . Otherwise , it is impossible to rule this great people of yours. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked this .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	11	So God said to him , “ You did not ask for a long life , or riches for yourself , or the death of your enemies . Since you asked for wisdom to make the right decisions ,
NCV	1%20Kings	3	12	I will do what you asked . I will give you wisdom and understanding that is greater than anyone has had in the past or will have in the future .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	13	I will also give you what you did not ask for : riches and honor . During your life no other king will be as great as you .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	14	If you follow me and obey my laws and commands , as your father David did , I will also give you a long life. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	15	After Solomon woke up from the dream , he went to Jerusalem . He stood before the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord , where he made burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . After that , he gave a feast for all his leaders and officers . Solomon Makes a Wise Decision
NCV	1%20Kings	3	16	One day two women who were prostitutes came to Solomon . As they stood before him ,
NCV	1%20Kings	3	17	one of the women said , “ My master , this woman and I live in the same house . I gave birth to a baby while she was there with me .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	18	Three days later this woman also gave birth to a baby . No one else was in the house with us ; it was just the two of us .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	19	One night this woman rolled over on her baby , and he died .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	20	So she took my son from my bed during the night while I was asleep , and she carried him to her bed . Then she put the dead baby in my bed .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	21	The next morning when I got up to feed my baby , I saw that he was dead ! When I looked at him more closely , I realized he was not my son. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	22	“ No ! ” the other woman cried . “ The living baby is my son , and the dead baby is yours ! ” But the first woman said , “ No ! The dead baby is yours , and the living one is mine ! ” So the two women argued before the king .
NCV	1%20Kings	3	23	Then King Solomon said , “ One of you says , ‘ My son is alive and your son is dead. ’ Then the other one says , ‘ No ! Your son is dead and my son is alive. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	24	The king sent his servants to get a sword . When they brought it to him ,
NCV	1%20Kings	3	25	he said , “ Cut the living baby into two pieces , and give each woman half. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	26	The real mother of the living child was full of love for her son . So she said to the king , “ Please , my master , don ’ t kill him ! Give the baby to her ! ” But the other woman said , “ Neither of us will have him . Cut him into two pieces ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	27	Then King Solomon said , “ Don ’ t kill him . Give the baby to the first woman , because she is the real mother. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	3	28	When the people of Israel heard about King Solomon ’ s decision , they respected him very much . They saw he had wisdom from God to make the right decisions . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	5	6	So send your men to cut down cedar trees for me from Lebanon . My servants will work with yours , and I will pay them whatever wages you decide . We don ’ t have anyone who can cut down trees as well as the people of Sidon. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	5	7	When Hiram heard what Solomon asked , he was very happy . He said , “ Praise the Lord today ! He has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	5	8	Then Hiram sent back this message to Solomon : “ I received the message you sent , and I will give you all the cedar and pine trees you want .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	9	My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea . There I will tie them together and float them along the shore to the place you choose . Then I will separate the logs there , and you can take them away . In return it is my wish that you give food to all those who live with me. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	5	10	So Hiram gave Solomon as much cedar and pine as he wanted .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	11	And Solomon gave Hiram about one hundred twenty-five thousand bushels of wheat each year to feed the people who lived with him . Solomon also gave him about one hundred fifteen thousand gallons of pure olive oil every year .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	12	The Lord gave Solomon wisdom as he had promised . And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; these two kings made a treaty between themselves .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	13	King Solomon forced thirty thousand men of Israel to help in this work .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	14	He sent a group of ten thousand men each month to Lebanon . Each group worked in Lebanon one month , then went home for two months . A man named Adoniram was in charge .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	15	Solomon forced eighty thousand men to work in the hill country , cutting stone , and he had seventy thousand men to carry the stones .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	16	There were also thirty-three hundred men who directed the workers .
NCV	1%20Kings	5	17	King Solomon commanded them to cut large blocks of fine stone to be used for the foundation of the Temple .

NCV	1%20Kings	6	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	6	6	The rooms on the bottom floor were seven and one-half feet wide . Those on the middle floor were nine feet wide , and the rooms above them were ten and one-half feet wide . The Temple wall that formed the side of each room was thinner than the wall in the room below . These rooms were pushed against the Temple wall , but they did not have their main beams built into this wall .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	2	The Temple was ninety feet long , thirty feet wide , and forty-five feet high .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	3	The porch in front of the main room of the Temple was fifteen feet deep and thirty feet wide . This room ran along the front of the Temple itself . Its width was equal to that of the Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	4	The Temple also had windows that opened and closed .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	5	Solomon also built some side rooms against the walls of the main room and the inner room of the Temple . He built rooms all around .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	7	The stones were prepared at the same place where they were cut from the ground . Since these stones were the only ones used to build the Temple , there was no noise of hammers , axes , or any other iron tools at the Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	8	The entrance to the lower rooms beside the Temple was on the south side . From there , stairs went up to the second-floor rooms . And from there , stairs went on to the third-floor rooms .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	9	Solomon put a roof made from beams and cedar boards on the Temple . So he finished building the Temple
NCV	1%20Kings	6	10	as well as the bottom floor that was beside the Temple . This bottom floor was seven and one-half feet high and was attached to the Temple by cedar beams .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	11	The Lord said to Solomon :
NCV	1%20Kings	6	12	“ If you obey all my laws and commands , I will do for you what I promised your father David .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	13	I will live among the Israelites in this Temple , and I will never leave my people Israel. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	6	14	So Solomon finished building the Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	15	The inside walls were covered from floor to ceiling with cedar boards . The floor was made from pine boards .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	16	A room thirty feet long was built in the back part of the Temple . This room , called the Most Holy Place , was separated from the rest of the Temple by cedar boards which reached from floor to ceiling .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	17	The main room , the one in front of the Most Holy Place , was sixty feet long .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	18	Everything inside the Temple was covered with cedar , which was carved with pictures of flowers and plants . A person could not see the stones of the wall , only the cedar .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	19	Solomon prepared the inner room at the back of the Temple to keep the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	20	This inner room was thirty feet long , thirty feet wide , and thirty feet high . He covered this room with pure gold , and he also covered the altar of cedar .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	21	He covered the inside of the Temple with pure gold , placing gold chains across the front of the inner room , which was also covered with gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	22	So all the inside of the Temple , as well as the altar of the Most Holy Place , was covered with gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	23	Solomon made two creatures from olive wood and placed them in the Most Holy Place . Each creature was fifteen feet tall
NCV	1%20Kings	6	24	and had two wings . Each wing was seven and one-half feet long , so it was fifteen feet from the end of one wing to the end of the other .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	25	The creatures were the same size and shape ;
NCV	1%20Kings	6	26	each was fifteen feet tall .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	27	These creatures were put beside each other in the Most Holy Place with their wings spread out . One creature ’ s wing touched one wall , and the other creature ’ s wing touched the other wall with their wings touching each other in the middle of the room .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	28	These two creatures were covered with gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	29	All the walls around the Temple were carved with pictures of creatures with wings , as well as palm trees and flowers . This was true for both the main room and the inner room .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	30	The floors of both rooms were covered with gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	31	Doors made from olive wood were placed at the entrance to the Most Holy Place . These doors had five-sided frames .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	32	Creatures with wings , as well as palm trees and flowers , were also carved on the two olive wood doors that were covered with gold . The creatures and the palm trees on the doors were covered with gold as well .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	33	At the entrance to the main room there was a square door frame made of olive wood .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	34	Two doors were made from pine . Each door had two parts so the doors folded .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	35	The doors were covered with pictures of creatures with wings , as well as palm trees and flowers . All of the carvings were covered with gold , which was evenly spread over them .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	36	The inner courtyard was enclosed by walls , which were made of three rows of cut stones and one row of cedar boards .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	37	Work began on the Temple in Ziv , the second month , during the fourth year Solomon was king over Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	6	38	The Temple was finished during the eleventh year he was king , in the eighth month , the month of Bul . It was built exactly as it was planned . Solomon had spent seven years building it . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	7	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	7	7	Solomon also built a throne room where he judged people , called the Hall of Justice . This room was covered with cedar from the floor to the ceiling .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	2	Built of cedars from the Forest of Lebanon , it was one hundred fifty feet long , seventy-five feet wide , and forty-five feet high . It had four rows of cedar columns which supported the cedar beams .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	3	There were forty-five beams on the roof , with fifteen beams in each row , and the ceiling was covered with cedar above the beams .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	4	Windows were placed in three rows facing each other .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	5	All the doors were square , and the three doors at each end faced each other .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	6	Solomon also built the porch that had pillars . This porch was seventy-five feet long and forty-five feet wide . Along the front of the porch was a roof supported by pillars .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	8	The palace where Solomon lived was built like the Hall of Justice , and it was behind this hall . Solomon also built the same kind of palace for his wife , who was the daughter of the king of Egypt .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	9	All these buildings were made with blocks of fine stone . First they were carefully cut . Then they were trimmed with a saw in the front and back . These fine stones went from the foundations of the buildings to the top of the walls . Even the courtyard was made with blocks of stone .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	10	The foundations were made with large blocks of fine stone , some as long as fifteen feet . Others were twelve feet long .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	11	On top of these foundation stones were other blocks of fine stone and cedar beams .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	12	The palace courtyard , the courtyard inside the Temple , and the porch of the Temple were surrounded by walls . All of these walls had three rows of stone blocks and one row of cedar beams . The Temple Is Completed Inside
NCV	1%20Kings	7	13	King Solomon sent to Tyre and had Huram brought to him .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	14	Huram ’ s mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali . His father was from Tyre and had been skilled in making things from bronze . Huram was also very skilled and experienced in bronze work . So he came to King Solomon and did all the bronze work .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	15	He made two bronze pillars , each one twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet around .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	16	He also made two bronze capitals that were seven and one-half feet tall , and he put them on top of the pillars .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	17	Then he made a net of seven chains for each capital , which covered the capitals on top of the two pillars .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	18	He made two rows of bronze pomegranates to go on the nets . These covered the capitals at the top of the pillars .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	19	The capitals on top of the pillars in the porch were shaped like lilies , and they were six feet tall .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	20	The capitals were on top of both pillars , above the bowl-shaped section and next to the nets . At that place there were two hundred pomegranates in rows all around the capitals .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	21	Huram put these two bronze pillars at the porch of the Temple . He named the south pillar He Establishes and the north pillar In Him Is Strength .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	22	The capitals on top of the pillars were shaped like lilies . So the work on the pillars was finished .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	23	Then Huram made from bronze a large round bowl , which was called the Sea . It was forty-five feet around , fifteen feet across , and seven and one-half feet deep .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	24	Around the outer edge of the bowl was a rim . Under this rim were two rows of bronze plants which surrounded the bowl . There were ten plants every eighteen inches , and these plants were made in one piece with the bowl .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	25	The bowl rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward from the center of the bowl . Three bulls faced north , three faced west , three faced south , and three faced east .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	26	The sides of the bowl were four inches thick , and it held about eleven thousand gallons . The rim of the bowl was like the rim of a cup or like a lily blossom .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	27	Then Huram made ten bronze stands , each one six feet long , six feet wide , and four and one-half feet high .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	28	The stands were made from square sides , which were put on frames .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	29	On the sides were bronze lions , bulls , and creatures with wings . On the frames above and below the lions and bulls were designs of flowers hammered into the bronze .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	30	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles . At the corners there were bronze supports for a large bowl , and the supports had designs of flowers .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	31	There was a frame on top of the bowls , eighteen inches high above the bowls . The opening of the bowl was round , twenty-seven inches deep . Designs were carved into the bronze on the frame , which was square , not round .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	32	The four wheels , placed under the frame , were twenty-seven inches high . The axles between the wheels were made as one piece with the stand .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	33	The wheels were like a chariot ’ s wheels . Everything on the wheels—the axles , rims , spokes , and hubs—were made of bronze .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	34	The four supports were on the four corners of each stand . They were made as one piece with the stand .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	35	A strip of bronze around the top of each stand was nine inches deep . It was also made as one piece with the stand .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	36	The sides of the stand and the frames were covered with carvings of creatures with wings , as well as lions , palm trees , and flowers .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	37	This is the way Huram made the ten stands . The bronze for each stand was melted and poured into a mold , so all the stands were the same size and shape .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	38	Huram also made ten bronze bowls , one bowl for each of the ten stands . Each bowl was six feet across and could hold about two hundred thirty gallons .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	39	Huram put five stands on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side . He put the large bowl in the southeast corner of the Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	40	Huram also made bowls , shovels , and small bowls . So Huram finished all his work for King Solomon on the Temple of the Lord :
NCV	1%20Kings	7	41	two pillars ; two large bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars ; two nets to cover the two large bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars ;
NCV	1%20Kings	7	42	four hundred pomegranates for the two nets ( there were two rows of pomegranates for each net covering the bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars ) ;
NCV	1%20Kings	7	43	ten stands with a bowl on each stand ;
NCV	1%20Kings	7	44	the large bowl with twelve bulls under it ;
NCV	1%20Kings	7	45	the pots , shovels , small bowls , and all the utensils for the Temple of the Lord . Huram made everything King Solomon wanted from polished bronze .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	46	The king had these things poured into clay molds that were made in the plain of the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	47	Solomon never weighed the bronze used to make these things , because there was too much to weigh . So the total weight of all the bronze was never known .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	48	Solomon also made all the items for the Temple of the Lord : the golden altar ; the golden table which held the bread that shows God ’ s people are in his presence ;
NCV	1%20Kings	7	49	the lampstands of pure gold ( five on the right side and five on the left side in front of the Most Holy Place ) ; the flowers , lamps , and tongs of gold ;
NCV	1%20Kings	7	50	the pure gold bowls , wick trimmers , small bowls , pans , and dishes used to carry coals ; the gold hinges for the doors of the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	7	51	Finally the work King Solomon did for the Temple of the Lord was finished . Solomon brought in everything his father David had set apart for the Temple—silver , gold , and other articles . He put everything in the treasuries of the Temple of the Lord .

NCV	1%20Kings	8	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	8	8	The carrying poles were so long that anyone standing in the Holy Place in front of the Most Holy Place could see the ends of the poles , but no one could see them from outside the Holy Place . The poles are still there today .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	2	So all the Israelites came together with King Solomon during the festival in the month of Ethanim , the seventh month .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	3	When all the elders of Israel arrived , the priests lifted up the Ark .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	4	They carried the Ark of the Lord , the Meeting Tent , and the holy utensils ; the priests and the Levites brought them up .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	5	King Solomon and all the Israelites gathered before the Ark and sacrificed so many sheep and cattle no one could count them all .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	6	Then the priests put the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord in its place inside the Most Holy Place in the Temple , under the wings of the golden creatures .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	7	The wings of these creatures were spread out over the place for the Ark , covering it and its carrying poles .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	9	The only things inside the Ark were two stone tablets [ a ] that Moses had put in the Ark at Mount Sinai . That was where the Lord made his agreement with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	10	When the priests left the Holy Place , a cloud filled the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	11	The priests could not continue their work , because the Temple was filled with the glory of the Lord . Solomon Speaks to the People
NCV	1%20Kings	8	12	Then Solomon said , “ The Lord said he would live in a dark cloud .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	13	Lord , I have truly built a wonderful Temple for you—a place for you to live forever. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	8	14	While all the Israelites were standing there , King Solomon turned to them and blessed them .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	15	Then he said , “ Praise the Lord , the God of Israel . He has done what he promised to my father David . The Lord said ,
NCV	1%20Kings	8	16	‘ Since the time I brought my people Israel out of Egypt , I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel where a temple will be built for me . But I have chosen David to lead my people Israel. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	8	17	“ My father David wanted to build a temple for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	18	But the Lord said to my father David , ‘ It was good that you wanted to build a temple for me .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	19	But you are not the one to build it . Your son , who comes from your own body , is the one who will build my temple. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	8	20	“ Now the Lord has kept his promise . I am the king now in place of David my father . Now I rule Israel as the Lord promised , and I have built the Temple for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	21	I have made a place there for the Ark , in which is the Agreement the Lord made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt. ” Solomon ’ s Prayer
NCV	1%20Kings	8	22	Then Solomon stood facing the Lord ’ s altar , and all the Israelites were standing behind him . He spread out his hands toward the sky
NCV	1%20Kings	8	23	and said : “ Lord , God of Israel , there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below . You keep your agreement of love with your servants who truly follow you .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	24	You have kept the promise you made to your servant David , my father . You spoke it with your own mouth and finished it with your hands today .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	25	Now Lord , God of Israel , keep the promise you made to your servant David , my father . You said , ‘ If your sons are careful to obey me as you have obeyed me , there will always be someone from your family ruling Israel. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	8	26	Now , God of Israel , please continue to keep that promise you made to your servant David , my father .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But , God , can you really live here on the earth ? The sky and the highest place in heaven can not contain you . Surely this house which I have built can not contain you .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	28	But please listen to my prayer and my request , because I am your servant . Lord my God , hear this prayer your servant prays to you today .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	29	Night and day please watch over this Temple where you have said , ‘ I will be worshiped there. ’ Hear the prayer I pray facing this Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	30	Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when we pray facing this place . Hear from your home in heaven , and when you hear , forgive us .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	31	“ If someone wrongs another person , he will be brought to the altar in this Temple . If he swears an oath that he is not guilty ,
NCV	1%20Kings	8	32	then hear in heaven . Judge the case , punish the guilty , but declare that the innocent person is not guilty .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	33	“ When your people , the Israelites , sin against you , their enemies will defeat them . But if they come back to you and praise you and pray to you in this Temple ,
NCV	1%20Kings	8	34	then hear them in heaven . Forgive the sins of your people Israel , and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	35	“ When they sin against you , you will stop the rain from falling on their land . Then they will pray , facing this place and praising you ; they will stop sinning when you make them suffer .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	36	When this happens , please hear their prayer in heaven , and forgive the sins of your servants , the Israelites . Teach them to do what is right . Then please send rain to this land you have given particularly to them .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	37	“ At times the land will become so dry that no food will grow , or a great sickness will spread among the people . Sometimes all the crops will be destroyed by locusts or grasshoppers . Your people will be attacked in their cities by their enemy or will become sick .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	38	When any of these things happen , the people will become truly sorry . If your people spread their hands in prayer toward this Temple ,
NCV	1%20Kings	8	39	then hear their prayers from your home in heaven . Forgive and treat each person as he should be treated because you know what is in a person ’ s heart . Only you know what is in everyone ’ s heart .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	40	Then your people will respect you as long as they live in this land you gave to our ancestors . 41-42 “ People who are not Israelites , foreigners from other lands , will hear about your greatness and power . They will come from far away to pray at this Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	43	Then hear from your home in heaven , and do whatever they ask you . Then people everywhere will know you and respect you , just as your people in Israel do . Then everyone will know I built this Temple as a place to worship you .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	44	“ When your people go out to fight their enemies along some road on which you send them , your people will pray to you , facing the city which you have chosen and the Temple I have built for you .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	45	Then hear in heaven their prayers , and do what is right .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	46	“ Everyone sins , so your people will also sin against you . You will become angry with them and hand them over to their enemies . Their enemies will capture them and take them away to their countries far or near .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	47	Your people will be sorry for their sins when they are held as prisoners in another country . They will be sorry and pray to you in the land where they are held as prisoners , saying , ‘ We have sinned . We have done wrong and acted wickedly. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	8	48	They will truly turn back to you in the land of their enemies . They will pray to you , facing this land you gave their ancestors , this city you have chosen , and the Temple I have built for you .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	49	Then hear their prayers from your home in heaven , and do what is right .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	50	Forgive your people of all their sins and for turning against you . Make those who have captured them show them mercy .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	51	Remember , they are your special people . You brought them out of Egypt , as if you were pulling them out of a blazing furnace .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	52	“ Give your attention to my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel . Listen to them anytime they ask you for help .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	53	You chose them from all the nations on earth to be your very own people . This is what you promised through Moses your servant when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt , Lord God. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	8	54	Solomon prayed this prayer to the Lord , kneeling in front of the altar with his arms raised toward heaven . When he finished praying , he got up .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	55	Then , in a loud voice , he stood and blessed all the people of Israel , saying :
NCV	1%20Kings	8	56	“ Praise the Lord ! He promised he would give rest to his people Israel , and he has given us rest . The Lord has kept all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	57	May the Lord our God be with us as he was with our ancestors . May he never leave us ,
NCV	1%20Kings	8	58	and may he turn us to himself so we will follow him . Let us obey all the laws and commands he gave our ancestors .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	59	May the Lord our God remember this prayer day and night and do what is right for his servant and his people Israel day by day .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	60	Then all the people of the world will know the Lord is the only true God .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	61	You must fully obey the Lord our God and follow all his laws and commands . Continue to obey in the future as you do now. ” Sacrifices Are Offered
NCV	1%20Kings	8	62	Then King Solomon and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	63	Solomon killed twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep as fellowship offerings . So the king and all the people gave the Temple to the Lord .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	64	On that day King Solomon made holy the middle part of the courtyard which is in front of the Temple of the Lord . There he offered whole burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the fat of the fellowship offerings . He offered them in the courtyard , because the bronze altar before the Lord was too small to hold all the burnt offerings , the grain offerings , and the fat of the fellowship offerings .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	65	Solomon and all the Israelites celebrated the other festival that came at that time . People came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the brook of Egypt . A great many people celebrated before the Lord for seven days , then seven more days , for a total of fourteen days .
NCV	1%20Kings	8	66	On the following day Solomon sent the people home . They blessed the king as they went , happy because of all the good things the Lord had done for his servant David and his people Israel .

NCV	1%20Kings	9	9	People will answer , ‘ This happened because they left the Lord their God . This was the God who brought their ancestors out of Egypt , but they decided to follow other gods . They worshiped and served those gods , so the Lord brought all this disaster on them. ’ ” Solomon ’ s Other Achievements
NCV	1%20Kings	9	2	Then the Lord appeared to him again just as he had done before , in Gibeon .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	3	The Lord said to him : “ I have heard your prayer and what you have asked me to do . You built this Temple , and I have made it a holy place . I will be worshiped there forever and will watch over it and protect it always .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	4	“ But you must serve me as your father David did ; he was fair and sincere . You must obey all I have commanded and keep my laws and rules .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	5	If you do , I will make your kingdom strong . This is the promise I made to your father David—that someone from his family would always rule Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	6	“ But you and your children must follow me and obey the laws and commands I have given you . You must not serve or worship other gods .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	7	If you do , I will force Israel to leave the land I have given them , and I will leave this Temple that I have made holy . All the nations will make fun of Israel and speak evil about them .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	8	If the Temple is destroyed , everyone who passes by will be shocked . They will make fun of you and ask , ‘ Why did the Lord do this terrible thing to this land and this Temple ? ’
NCV	1%20Kings	9	10	By the end of twenty years , King Solomon had built two buildings—the Temple of the Lord and the royal palace .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	11	At that time King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre , because Hiram had helped with the buildings . Hiram had given Solomon all the cedar , pine , and gold he wanted .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	12	So Hiram traveled from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him , but when he saw them , he was not pleased .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	13	He asked , “ What good are these towns you have given me , my brother ? ” So he named them the Land of Cabul , [ a ] and they are still called that today .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	14	Hiram had sent Solomon about nine thousand pounds of gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	15	This is the account of the forced labor Solomon used to build the Temple and the palace . He had them fill in the land and build the wall around Jerusalem . He also had them rebuild the cities of Hazor , Megiddo , and Gezer .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	16	( In the past the king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer . After burning it , he killed the Canaanites who lived there . Then he gave it as a wedding present to his daughter , who married Solomon .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	17	So Solomon rebuilt it . ) He also built the cities of Lower Beth Horon
NCV	1%20Kings	9	18	and Baalath , as well as Tadmor , which is in the desert .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	19	King Solomon also built cities for storing grain and supplies and cities for his chariots and horses . He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem , Lebanon , and everywhere he ruled .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	20	There were other people in the land who were not Israelites—Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	21	They were descendants of people that the Israelites had not destroyed . Solomon forced them to work for him as slaves , as is still true today .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	22	But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites . They were his soldiers , government leaders , officers , captains , chariot commanders , and drivers .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	23	These were his most important officers over the work . There were five hundred fifty supervisors over the people who did the work on Solomon ’ s projects .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	24	The daughter of the king of Egypt moved from the old part of Jerusalem to the palace that Solomon had built for her . Then Solomon filled in the surrounding land .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	25	Three times each year Solomon offered whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the Lord . He also burned incense before the Lord . So he finished the work on the Temple .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	26	King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber , a town near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	27	Hiram had skilled sailors , so he sent them to serve in these ships with Solomon ’ s men .
NCV	1%20Kings	9	28	The ships sailed to Ophir and brought back about thirty-two thousand pounds of gold to King Solomon . Footnotes - 9:13 Cabul This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “ worthless. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	10	10	Then she gave the king about nine thousand pounds of gold and many spices and jewels . No one since that time has brought more spices than the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	2	She traveled to Jerusalem with a large group of servants and camels carrying spices , jewels , and much gold . When she came to Solomon , she talked with him about all she had in mind ,
NCV	1%20Kings	10	3	and Solomon answered all her questions . Nothing was too hard for him to explain to her .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	4	The queen of Sheba learned that Solomon was very wise . She saw the palace he had built ,
NCV	1%20Kings	10	5	the food on his table , his many officers , the palace servants , and their good clothes . She saw the servants who served him at feasts and the whole burnt offerings he made in the Temple of the Lord . All these things amazed her .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	6	So she said to King Solomon , “ What I heard in my own country about your achievements and wisdom is true .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	7	I could not believe it then , but now I have come and seen it with my own eyes . I was not told even half of it ! Your wisdom and wealth are much greater than I had heard .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	8	Your men and officers are very lucky , because in always serving you , they are able to hear your wisdom .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	9	Praise the Lord your God , who was pleased to make you king of Israel . The Lord has constant love for Israel , so he made you king to keep justice and to rule fairly. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	10	11	( Hiram ’ s ships brought gold from Ophir , as well as much juniper wood and jewels .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	12	Solomon used the juniper wood to build supports for the Temple of the Lord and the palace , and to make harps and lyres for the musicians . Such fine juniper wood has not been brought in or been seen since that time . )
NCV	1%20Kings	10	13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and asked for , in addition to what he had already given her of his wealth . Then she and her servants returned to her own country . Solomon ’ s Wealth
NCV	1%20Kings	10	14	Every year King Solomon received about fifty thousand pounds of gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	15	Besides that , he also received gold from the traders and merchants , as well as from the kings of Arabia and governors of the land .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold , each of which contained about seven and one-half pounds of gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	17	He also made three hundred smaller shields of hammered gold , each of which contained about four pounds of gold . The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	18	The king built a large throne of ivory and covered it with fine gold .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	19	The throne had six steps on it , and its back was round at the top . There were armrests on both sides of the chair , and each armrest had a lion beside it .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	20	Twelve lions stood on the six steps , one lion at each end of each step . Nothing like this had ever been made for any other kingdom .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	21	All of Solomon ’ s drinking cups , as well as the dishes in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon , were made of pure gold . Nothing was made from silver , because silver was not valuable in Solomon ’ s time .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	22	King Solomon also had many trading ships at sea , along with Hiram ’ s ships . Every three years the ships returned , bringing back gold , silver , ivory , apes , and baboons .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	23	So Solomon had more riches and wisdom than all the other kings on earth .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	24	People everywhere wanted to see King Solomon and listen to the wisdom God had given him .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	25	Every year those who came brought gifts of silver and gold , clothes , weapons , spices , horses , and mules .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	26	Solomon had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses . He kept some in special cities for the chariots , and others he kept with him in Jerusalem .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	27	In Jerusalem Solomon made silver as common as stones and cedar trees as common as the fig trees on the western hills .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	28	He imported horses from Egypt and Kue . His traders bought them in Kue .
NCV	1%20Kings	10	29	A chariot from Egypt cost about fifteen pounds of silver , and a horse cost nearly four pounds of silver . Solomon ’ s traders also sold horses and chariots to all the kings of the Hittites and the Arameans . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	11	11	So the Lord said to Solomon , “ Because you have chosen to break your agreement with me and have not obeyed my commands , I will tear your kingdom away from you and give it to one of your officers .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	2	The Lord had told the Israelites , “ You must not marry people of other nations . If you do , they will cause you to follow their gods. ” But Solomon fell in love with these women .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	3	He had seven hundred wives who were from royal families and three hundred slave women who gave birth to his children . His wives caused him to turn away from God .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	4	As Solomon grew old , his wives caused him to follow other gods . He did not follow the Lord completely as his father David had done .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	5	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth , the goddess of the people of Sidon , and Molech , the hated god of the Ammonites .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	6	So Solomon did what the Lord said was wrong and did not follow the Lord completely as his father David had done .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	7	On a hill east of Jerusalem , Solomon built two places for worship . One was a place to worship Chemosh , the hated god of the Moabites , and the other was a place to worship Molech , the hated god of the Ammonites .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	8	Solomon did the same thing for all his foreign wives so they could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their gods .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	9	The Lord had appeared to Solomon twice , but the king turned away from following the Lord , the God of Israel . The Lord was angry with Solomon ,
NCV	1%20Kings	11	10	because he had commanded Solomon not to follow other gods . But Solomon did not obey the Lord ’ s command .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	12	But I will not take it away while you are alive because of my love for your father David . I will tear it away from your son when he becomes king .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	13	I will not tear away all the kingdom from him , but I will leave him one tribe to rule . I will do this because of David , my servant , and because of Jerusalem , the city I have chosen. ” Solomon ’ s Enemies
NCV	1%20Kings	11	14	The Lord caused Hadad the Edomite , a member of the family of the king of Edom , to become Solomon ’ s enemy .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	15	Earlier , David had defeated Edom . When Joab , the commander of David ’ s army , went into Edom to bury the dead , he killed all the males .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	16	Joab and all the Israelites stayed in Edom for six months and killed every male in Edom .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	17	At that time Hadad was only a young boy , so he ran away to Egypt with some of his father ’ s officers .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	18	They left Midian and went to Paran , where they were joined by other men . Then they all went to Egypt to see the king , who gave Hadad a house , some food , and some land .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	19	The king liked Hadad so much he gave Hadad a wife—the sister of Tahpenes , the king ’ s wife .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	20	They had a son named Genubath . Queen Tahpenes brought him up in the royal palace with the king ’ s own children .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	21	While he was in Egypt , Hadad heard that David had died and that Joab , the commander of the army , was dead also . So Hadad said to the king , “ Let me go ; I will return to my own country. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	11	22	“ Why do you want to go back to your own country ? ” the king asked . “ What haven ’ t I given you here ? ” “ Nothing , ” Hadad answered , “ but please , let me go. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	11	23	God also caused another man to be Solomon ’ s enemy—Rezon son of Eliada . Rezon had run away from his master , Hadadezer king of Zobah .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	24	After David defeated the army of Zobah , Rezon gathered some men and became the leader of a small army . They went to Damascus and settled there , and Rezon became king of Damascus .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	25	Rezon ruled Aram , and he hated Israel . So he was an enemy of Israel all the time Solomon was alive . Both Rezon and Hadad made trouble for Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	26	Jeroboam son of Nebat was one of Solomon ’ s officers . He was an Ephraimite from the town of Zeredah , and he was the son of a widow named Zeruah . Jeroboam turned against the king .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	27	This is the story of how Jeroboam turned against the king . Solomon was filling in the land and repairing the wall of Jerusalem , the city of David , his father .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	28	Jeroboam was a capable man , and Solomon saw that this young man was a good worker . So Solomon put him over all the workers from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	29	One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem , Ahijah , the prophet from Shiloh , who was wearing a new coat , met him on the road . The two men were alone out in the country .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	30	Ahijah took his new coat and tore it into twelve pieces .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	31	Then he said to Jeroboam , “ Take ten pieces of this coat for yourself . The Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I will tear the kingdom away from Solomon and give you ten tribes .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	32	But I will allow him to control one tribe . I will do this for the sake of my servant David and for Jerusalem , the city I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	33	I will do this because Solomon has stopped following me and has worshiped the Sidonian god Ashtoreth , the Moabite god Chemosh , and the Ammonite god Molech . Solomon has not obeyed me by doing what I said is right and obeying my laws and commands , as his father David did .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	34	“ ‘ But I will not take all the kingdom away from Solomon . I will let him rule all his life because of my servant David , whom I chose , who obeyed all my commands and laws .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	35	But I will take the kingdom away from his son , and I will allow you to rule over the ten tribes .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	36	I will allow Solomon ’ s son to continue to rule over one tribe so that there will always be a descendant of David , my servant , in Jerusalem , the city where I chose to be worshiped .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	37	But I will make you rule over everything you want . You will rule over all of Israel ,
NCV	1%20Kings	11	38	and I will always be with you if you do what I say is right . You must obey all my commands . If you obey my laws and commands as David did , I will be with you . I will make your family a lasting family of kings , as I did for David , and give Israel to you .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	39	I will punish David ’ s children because of this , but I will not punish them forever. ’ ” Solomon ’ s Death
NCV	1%20Kings	11	40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam , but he ran away to Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt , where he stayed until Solomon died .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	41	Everything else King Solomon did , and the wisdom he showed , is written in the book of the history of Solomon .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	42	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years .
NCV	1%20Kings	11	43	Then he died and was buried in Jerusalem , the city of David , his father . And his son Rehoboam became king in his place . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	1%20Kings	11	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	12	12	Rehoboam had told the people , “ Come back to me in three days. ” So after three days Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	2	Jeroboam son of Nebat was still in Egypt , where he had gone to escape from Solomon . When Jeroboam heard about Rehoboam being made king , he was living in Egypt .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	3	After the people sent for him , he and the people went to Rehoboam and said to him ,
NCV	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father forced us to work very hard . Now , make it easier for us , and don ’ t make us work as hard as he did . Then we will serve you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	5	Rehoboam answered , “ Go away for three days , and then come back to me. ” So the people left .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	6	King Rehoboam asked the elders who had advised Solomon during his lifetime , “ How do you think I should answer these people ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	7	They said , “ You should be like a servant to them today . If you serve them and give them a kind answer , they will serve you always. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam rejected this advice . Instead , he asked the young men who had grown up with him and who served as his advisers .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	9	Rehoboam asked them , “ What is your advice ? How should we answer these people who said , ‘ Don ’ t make us work as hard as your father did ’ ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	10	The young men who had grown up with him answered , “ Those people said to you , ‘ Your father forced us to work very hard . Now make our work easier. ’ You should tell them , ‘ My little finger is bigger than my father ’ s legs .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	11	He forced you to work hard , but I will make you work even harder . My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	13	King Rehoboam spoke cruel words to them , because he had rejected the advice the elders had given him .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	14	He followed the advice of the young men and said to the people , “ My father forced you to work hard , but I will make you work even harder . My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king did not listen to the people . The Lord caused this to happen to keep the promise he had made to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah , a prophet from Shiloh .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	16	When all the Israelites saw that the new king refused to listen to them , they said to the king , “ We have no share in David ! We have no part in the son of Jesse ! People of Israel , let ’ s go to our own homes ! Let David ’ s son rule his own people ! ” So the Israelites went home .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	18	Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor . When Rehoboam sent him to the people of Israel , they threw stones at him until he died . But King Rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	19	Since then , Israel has been against the family of David .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	20	When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned , they called him to a meeting and made him king over all Israel . Only the tribe of Judah continued to follow the family of David .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem , he gathered one hundred eighty thousand of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin . As son of Solomon , Rehoboam wanted to fight the people of Israel to take back his kingdom .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	22	But God spoke his word to Shemaiah , a man of God , saying ,
NCV	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Speak to Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam , the king of Judah , and to all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people . Say to them ,
NCV	1%20Kings	12	24	‘ The Lord says you must not go to war against your brothers , the Israelites . Every one of you should go home , because I made all these things happen. ’ ” So they obeyed the Lord ’ s command and went home as the Lord had commanded .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	25	Then Jeroboam made Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim a very strong city , and he lived there . He also went to the city of Peniel and made it stronger . Jeroboam Builds Golden Calves
NCV	1%20Kings	12	26	Jeroboam said to himself , “ The kingdom will probably go back to David ’ s family .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	27	If the people continue going to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem to offer sacrifices , they will want to be ruled again by Rehoboam . Then they will kill me and follow Rehoboam king of Judah. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	28	King Jeroboam asked for advice . Then he made two golden calves . “ It is too long a journey for you to go to Jerusalem to worship , ” he said to the people . “ Israel , here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	12	29	Jeroboam put one golden calf in the city of Bethel and the other in the city of Dan .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	30	This became a very great sin , because the people traveled as far as Dan to worship the calf there .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	31	Jeroboam built temples on the places of worship . He also chose priests from all the people , not just from the tribe of Levi .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	32	And he started a new festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , just like the festival in Judah . During that time the king offered sacrifices on the altar , along with sacrifices to the calves in Bethel he had made . He also chose priests in Bethel to serve at the places of worship he had made .
NCV	1%20Kings	12	33	So Jeroboam chose his own time for a festival for the Israelites—the fifteenth day of the eighth month . During that time he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built in Bethel . He set up a festival for the Israelites and offered sacrifices on the altar . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	13	13	Then the prophet told his sons to put a saddle on his donkey . So they saddled the donkey , and he left .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	2	The Lord had commanded the man of God to speak against the altar . The man said , “ Altar , altar , the Lord says to you : ‘ David ’ s family will have a son named Josiah . The priests for the places of worship now make their sacrifices on you , but Josiah will sacrifice those priests on you . Human bones will be burned on you. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	3	That same day the man of God gave proof that these things would happen . “ This is the Lord ’ s sign that this will happen , ” he said . “ This altar will break apart , and the ashes on it will fall to the ground. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	4	When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God said about the altar in Bethel , the king raised his hand from the altar and pointed at the man . “ Take him ! ” he said . But when the king said this , his arm was paralyzed , and he could not move it .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	5	The altar also broke into pieces , and its ashes fell to the ground . This was the sign the Lord had told the man of God to give .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	6	Then the king said to the man of God , “ Please pray to the Lord your God for me , and ask him to heal my arm. ” So the man of God prayed to the Lord , and the king ’ s arm was healed , becoming as it was before .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	7	Then the king said to the man of God , “ Please come home and eat with me , and I will give you a gift. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	8	But the man of God answered the king , “ Even if you gave me half of your kingdom , I would not go with you . I will not eat or drink anything in this place .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	9	The Lord commanded me not to eat or drink anything nor to return on the same road by which I came. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	10	So he took a different road and did not return on the same road by which he had come to Bethel .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	11	Now an old prophet was living in Bethel . His sons came and told him what the man of God had done there that day . They also told their father what he had said to King Jeroboam .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	12	The father asked , “ Which road did he use when he left ? ” So his sons showed him the road the man of God from Judah had taken .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	14	He went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree . The prophet asked , “ Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? ” The man answered , “ Yes , I am. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	15	The prophet said , “ Please come home and eat with me. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	16	“ I can ’ t go home with you , ” the man of God answered . “ I can ’ t eat or drink with you in this place .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	17	The Lord said to me , ‘ Don ’ t eat or drink anything there or return on the same road by which you came. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	18	Then the old prophet said , “ But I also am a prophet like you. ” Then he told a lie . He said , “ An angel from the Lord came to me and told me to bring you to my home . He said you should eat and drink with me. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	19	So the man of God went to the old prophet ’ s house , and he ate and drank with him there .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	20	While they were sitting at the table , the Lord spoke his word to the old prophet .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	21	The old prophet cried out to the man of God from Judah , “ The Lord said you did not obey him ! He said you did not do what the Lord your God commanded you .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	22	The Lord commanded you not to eat or drink anything in this place , but you came back and ate and drank . So your body will not be buried in your family grave. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	23	After the man of God finished eating and drinking , the prophet put a saddle on his donkey for him , and the man left .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	24	As he was traveling home , a lion attacked and killed him . His body lay on the road , with the donkey and the lion standing nearby .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	25	Some men who were traveling on that road saw the body and the lion standing nearby . So they went to the city where the old prophet lived and told what they had seen .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	26	The old prophet who had brought back the man of God heard what had happened . “ It is the man of God who did not obey the Lord ’ s command , ” he said . “ So the Lord sent a lion to kill him , just as he said he would. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	27	Then the prophet said to his sons , “ Put a saddle on my donkey , ” which they did .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	28	The old prophet went out and found the body lying on the road , with the donkey and the lion still standing nearby . The lion had not eaten the body or hurt the donkey .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	29	The prophet put the body on his donkey and carried it back to the city to have a time of sadness for him and to bury him .
NCV	1%20Kings	13	30	The prophet buried the body in his own family grave , and they were sad for the man of God and said , “ Oh , my brother. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	13	31	After the prophet buried the body , he said to his sons , “ When I die , bury me in this same grave . Put my bones next to his .

NCV	1%20Kings	14	14	“ The Lord will put a new king over Israel , who will destroy Jeroboam ’ s family , and this will happen soon .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	2	Chronicles
NCV	1%20Kings	14	3	Take the prophet ten loaves of bread , some cakes , and a jar of honey . Then ask him what will happen to our son , and he will tell you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	14	4	So the king ’ s wife did as he said and went to Ahijah ’ s home in Shiloh . Now Ahijah was very old and blind .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	5	The Lord said to him , “ Jeroboam ’ s son is sick , and Jeroboam ’ s wife is coming to ask you about him . When she arrives , she will pretend to be someone else. ” Then the Lord told Ahijah what to say .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	6	When Ahijah heard her walking to the door , he said , “ Come in , wife of Jeroboam . Why are you pretending to be someone else ? I have bad news for you .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	7	Go back and tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Jeroboam , I chose you from among all the people and made you the leader of my people Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	8	I tore the kingdom away from David ’ s family , and I gave it to you . But you are not like my servant David , who always obeyed my commands and followed me with all his heart . He did only what I said was right .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	9	But you have done more evil than anyone who ruled before you . You have quit following me and have made other gods and idols of metal . This has made me very angry ,
NCV	1%20Kings	14	10	so I will soon bring disaster to your family . I will kill all the men in your family , both slaves and free men . I will destroy your family as completely as fire burns up manure .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	11	Anyone from your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs , and those who die in the fields will be eaten by the birds . The Lord has spoken. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	14	12	Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam ’ s wife , “ Go home now . As soon as you enter your city , your son will die ,
NCV	1%20Kings	14	13	. The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	1%20Kings	14	15	Then the Lord will punish Israel , which will be like reeds swaying in the water . The Lord will pull up Israel from this good land , the land he gave their ancestors . He will scatter Israel beyond the Euphrates River , because he is angry with the people . They made the Lord angry when they set up idols to worship Asherah .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	16	Jeroboam sinned , and then he made the people of Israel sin . So the Lord will let the people of Israel be defeated. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	14	17	Then Jeroboam ’ s wife left and returned to Tirzah . As soon as she entered her home , the boy died .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	18	After they buried him , all Israel had a time of sadness for him , just as the Lord had said through his servant , the prophet Ahijah .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	19	Everything else Jeroboam did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel . He fought wars and continued to rule the people ,

NCV	1%20Kings	14	22	The people of Judah did what the Lord said was wrong . Their sins made the Lord very angry , even more angry than he had been at their ancestors .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	23	The people built stone pillars and places to worship gods and Asherah idols on every high hill and under every green tree .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	24	There were even male prostitutes in the land . They acted like the people who had lived in the land before the Israelites . They had done many evil things , and God had taken the land away from them .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	25	During the fifth year Rehoboam was king , Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	26	He took the treasures from the Temple of the Lord and the king ’ s palace . He took everything , even the gold shields Solomon had made .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	27	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to put in their place and gave them to the commanders of the guards for the palace gates .
NCV	1%20Kings	14	28	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the Lord , the guards carried the shields . Later , they would put them back in the guardroom .

NCV	1%20Kings	15	15	Asa brought into the Temple of the Lord the gifts he and his father had given : gold , silver , and utensils .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	2	Abijam ruled in Jerusalem for three years . His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	3	He did all the same sins his father before him had done . Abijam was not faithful to the Lord his God as David , his great-grandfather , had been .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	4	Because the Lord loved David , the Lord gave him a kingdom in Jerusalem and allowed him to have a son to be king after him . The Lord also kept Jerusalem safe .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	5	David always did what the Lord said was right and obeyed his commands all his life , except the one time when David sinned against Uriah the Hittite .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	6	There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam during Abijam ’ s lifetime .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	7	Everything else Abijam did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah . During the time Abijam ruled , there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .

NCV	1%20Kings	15	9	During the twentieth year Jeroboam was king of Israel , Asa became king of Judah .

NCV	1%20Kings	15	11	Asa did what the Lord said was right , as his ancestor David had done .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	12	He forced the male prostitutes at the worship places to leave the country . He also took away the idols that his ancestors had made .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	13	His grandmother Maacah had made a terrible Asherah idol , so Asa removed her from being queen mother . He cut down that idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	14	The places of worship to gods were not removed . Even so , Asa was faithful to the Lord all his life .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	16	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all the time they were kings .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	17	Baasha attacked Judah , and he made the town of Ramah strong so he could keep people from leaving or entering Judah , Asa ’ s country .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	18	Asa took the rest of the silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple of the Lord and his own palace and gave it to his officers . Then he sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon , who was the son of Hezion . Ben-Hadad was the king of Aram and ruled in the city of Damascus . Asa said ,
NCV	1%20Kings	15	19	“ Let there be a treaty between you and me as there was between my father and your father . I am sending you a gift of silver and gold . Break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will leave my land. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	15	20	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa , so he sent the commanders of his armies to attack the towns of Israel . They defeated the towns of Ijon , Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , as well as all Galilee and the area of Naphtali .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	21	When Baasha heard about these attacks , he stopped building up Ramah and returned to Tirzah .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	22	Then King Asa gave an order to all the people of Judah ; everyone had to help . They carried away all the stones and wood Baasha had been using in Ramah , and they used them to build up Geba and Mizpah in the land of Benjamin .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	23	Everything else Asa did—his victories and the cities he built—is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah . When he became old , he got a disease in his feet .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	24	After Asa died , he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem , the city of David , his ancestor . Then Jehoshaphat , Asa ’ s son , became king in his place . Nadab King of Israel
NCV	1%20Kings	15	25	Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel during the second year Asa was king of Judah . Nadab was king of Israel for two years ,
NCV	1%20Kings	15	26	and he did what the Lord said was wrong . Jeroboam had led the people of Israel to sin , and Nadab sinned in the same way as his father Jeroboam .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	27	Baasha son of Ahijah , from the tribe of Issachar , made plans to kill Nadab . Nadab and all Israel were attacking the Philistine town of Gibbethon , so Baasha killed Nadab there .

NCV	1%20Kings	15	29	As soon as Baasha became king , he killed all of Jeroboam ’ s family , leaving no one in Jeroboam ’ s family alive . He destroyed them all as the Lord had said would happen through his servant Ahijah from Shiloh .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	30	King Jeroboam had sinned very much and had led the people of Israel to sin , so he made the Lord , the God of Israel , very angry .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	31	Everything else Nadab did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	32	There was war between Asa king of Judah and Baasha king of Israel all the time they ruled .
NCV	1%20Kings	15	33	Baasha son of Ahijah became king of Israel during Asa ’ s third year as king of Judah . Baasha ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years ,

NCV	1%20Kings	16	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	16	16	The men in the camp heard that Zimri had made secret plans against King Elah and had killed him . So that day in the camp they made Omri , the commander of the army , king over Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	2	The Lord said , “ You were nothing , but I took you and made you a leader over my people Israel . But you have followed the ways of Jeroboam and have led my people Israel to sin . Their sins have made me angry ,
NCV	1%20Kings	16	3	so , Baasha , I will soon destroy you and your family . I will do to you what I did to the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	4	Anyone from your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs , and anyone from your family who dies in the fields will be eaten by birds. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	16	5	Everything else Baasha did and all his victories are written down in the book of the history of the kings of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	6	So Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah , and his son Elah became king in his place .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	7	The Lord spoke his word against Baasha and his family through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani . Baasha had done many things the Lord said were wrong , which made the Lord very angry . He did the same evil deeds that Jeroboam ’ s family had done before him . The Lord also spoke against Baasha because he killed all of Jeroboam ’ s family . Elah King of Israel
NCV	1%20Kings	16	8	Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel during Asa ’ s twenty-sixth year as king of Judah , and Elah ruled in Tirzah for two years .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	9	Zimri , one of Elah ’ s officers , commanded half of Elah ’ s chariots . Zimri made plans against Elah while the king was in Tirzah , getting drunk at Arza ’ s home . ( Arza was in charge of the palace at Tirzah . )
NCV	1%20Kings	16	10	Zimri went into Arza ’ s house and killed Elah during Asa ’ s twenty-seventh year as king of Judah . Then Zimri became king of Israel in Elah ’ s place . Zimri King of Israel
NCV	1%20Kings	16	11	As soon as Zimri became king , he killed all of Baasha ’ s family , not allowing any of Baasha ’ s family or friends to live .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	12	So Zimri destroyed all of Baasha ’ s family just as the Lord had said it would happen through the prophet Jehu .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	13	Baasha and his son Elah sinned and led the people of Israel to sin , and they made the Lord , the God of Israel , angry because of their worthless idols .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	14	Everything else Elah did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	15	So during Asa ’ s twenty-seventh year as king of Judah , Zimri became king of Israel and ruled in Tirzah seven days . The army of Israel was camped near Gibbethon , a Philistine town .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	17	So Omri and all the Israelite army left Gibbethon and attacked Tirzah .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	18	When Zimri saw that the city had been captured , he went into the palace and set it on fire , burning the palace and himself with it .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	19	So Zimri died because he had sinned by doing what the Lord said was wrong . Jeroboam had led the people of Israel to sin , and Zimri sinned in the same way as Jeroboam .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	20	Everything else Zimri did and the story of how he turned against King Elah are written down in the book of the history of the kings of Israel . Omri King of Israel
NCV	1%20Kings	16	21	The people of Israel were divided into two groups . Half of the people wanted Tibni son of Ginath to be king , while the other half wanted Omri .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	22	Omri ’ s followers were stronger than the followers of Tibni son of Ginath , so Tibni died , and Omri became king .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	23	Omri became king of Israel during the thirty-first year Asa was king of Judah . Omri ruled Israel for twelve years , six of those years in the city of Tirzah .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	24	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for about one hundred fifty pounds of silver . Omri built a city on that hill and called it Samaria after the name of its earlier owner , Shemer .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	25	But Omri did what the Lord said was wrong ; he did more evil than all the kings who came before him .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	26	Jeroboam son of Nebat had led the people of Israel to sin , and Omri sinned in the same way as Jeroboam . The Israelites made the Lord , the God of Israel , very angry because they worshiped worthless idols .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	27	Everything else Omri did and all his successes are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	28	So Omri died and was buried in Samaria , and his son Ahab became king in his place . Ahab King of Israel
NCV	1%20Kings	16	29	Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel during Asa ’ s thirty-eighth year as king of Judah , and Ahab ruled Israel in the city of Samaria for twenty-two years .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	30	More than any king before him , Ahab son of Omri did many things the Lord said were wrong .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	31	He sinned in the same ways as Jeroboam son of Nebat , but he did even worse things . He married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal , the king of Sidon . Then Ahab began to serve Baal and worship him .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	32	He built a temple in Samaria for worshiping Baal and put an altar there for Baal .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	33	Ahab also made an idol for worshiping Asherah . He did more things to make the Lord , the God of Israel , angry than all the other kings before him .
NCV	1%20Kings	16	34	During the time of Ahab , Hiel from Bethel rebuilt the city of Jericho . It cost Hiel the life of Abiram , his oldest son , to begin work on the city , and it cost the life of Segub , his youngest son , to build the city gates . This happened just as the Lord , speaking through Joshua son of Nun , said it would happen .

NCV	1%20Kings	17	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	17	17	Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became sick . He grew worse and worse and finally stopped breathing .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	2	Then the Lord spoke his word to Elijah :
NCV	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Leave this place and go east and hide near Kerith Ravine east of the Jordan River .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	4	You may drink from the stream , and I have commanded ravens to bring you food there. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	5	So Elijah did what the Lord said ; he went to Kerith Ravine , east of the Jordan , and lived there .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	6	The birds brought Elijah bread and meat every morning and evening , and he drank water from the stream .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	7	After a while the stream dried up because there was no rain .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	8	Then the Lord spoke his word to Elijah ,
NCV	1%20Kings	17	9	“ Go to Zarephath in Sidon and live there . I have commanded a widow there to take care of you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	10	So Elijah went to Zarephath . When he reached the town gate , he saw a widow gathering wood for a fire . Elijah asked her , “ Would you bring me a little water in a cup so I may have a drink ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	11	As she was going to get his water , Elijah said , “ Please bring me a piece of bread , too. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	12	The woman answered , “ As surely as the Lord your God lives , I have no bread . I have only a handful of flour in a jar and only a little olive oil in a jug . I came here to gather some wood so I could go home and cook our last meal . My son and I will eat it and then die from hunger. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	13	“ Don ’ t worry , ” Elijah said to her . “ Go home and cook your food as you have said . But first make a small loaf of bread from the flour you have , and bring it to me . Then cook something for yourself and your son .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	14	The Lord , the God of Israel , says , ‘ That jar of flour will never be empty , and the jug will always have oil in it , until the day the Lord sends rain to the land. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	15	So the woman went home and did what Elijah told her to do . And the woman and her son and Elijah had enough food every day .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	16	The jar of flour and the jug of oil were never empty , just as the Lord , through Elijah , had promised . Elijah Brings a Boy Back to Life
NCV	1%20Kings	17	18	The woman said to Elijah , “ Man of God , what have you done to me ? Did you come here to remind me of my sin and to kill my son ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	19	Elijah said to her , “ Give me your son. ” Elijah took the boy from her , carried him upstairs , and laid him on the bed in the room where he was staying .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	20	Then he prayed to the Lord : “ Lord my God , this widow is letting me stay in her house . Why have you done this terrible thing to her and caused her son to die ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	21	Then Elijah lay on top of the boy three times . He prayed to the Lord , “ Lord my God , let this boy live again ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	17	22	The Lord answered Elijah ’ s prayer ; the boy began breathing again and was alive .
NCV	1%20Kings	17	23	Elijah carried the boy downstairs and gave him to his mother and said , “ See ! Your son is alive ! ”

NCV	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	18	18	Elijah answered , “ I have not made trouble in Israel . You and your father ’ s family have made all this trouble by not obeying the Lord ’ s commands . You have gone after the Baals .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to meet Ahab . By this time there was no food in Samaria .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	3	King Ahab sent for Obadiah , who was in charge of the king ’ s palace . ( Obadiah was a true follower of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	4	When Jezebel was killing all the Lord ’ s prophets , Obadiah hid a hundred of them in two caves , fifty in one cave and fifty in another . He also brought them food and water . )
NCV	1%20Kings	18	5	Ahab said to Obadiah , “ Let ’ s check every spring and valley in the land . Maybe we can find enough grass to keep our horses and mules alive and not have to kill our animals. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	6	So each one chose a part of the country to search ; Ahab went in one direction and Obadiah in another .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	7	While Obadiah was on his way , Elijah met him . Obadiah recognized Elijah , so he bowed down to the ground and said , “ Elijah ? Is it really you , master ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	8	“ Yes , ” Elijah answered . “ Go tell your master that I am here. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	9	Then Obadiah said , “ What wrong have I done for you to hand me over to Ahab like this ? He will put me to death .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	10	As surely as the Lord your God lives , the king has sent people to every country to search for you . If the ruler said you were not there , Ahab forced the ruler to swear you could not be found in his country .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	11	Now you want me to go to my master and tell him , ‘ Elijah is here ’ ?
NCV	1%20Kings	18	12	The Spirit of the Lord may carry you to some other place after I leave . If I go tell King Ahab you are here , and he comes and doesn ’ t find you , he will kill me ! I have followed the Lord since I was a boy .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	13	Haven ’ t you been told what I did ? When Jezebel was killing the Lord ’ s prophets , I hid a hundred of them , fifty in one cave and fifty in another . I brought them food and water .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	14	Now you want me to go and tell my master you are here ? He will kill me ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	15	Elijah answered , “ As surely as the Lord All-Powerful lives , whom I serve , I will be seen by Ahab today. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to Ahab and told him where Elijah was . Then Ahab went to meet Elijah .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	17	When he saw Elijah , he asked , “ Is it you—the biggest troublemaker in Israel ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	19	Now tell all Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel . Also bring the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah , who eat at Jezebel ’ s table. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab called all the Israelites and those prophets to Mount Carmel .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	21	Elijah approached the people and said , “ How long will you not decide between two choices ? If the Lord is the true God , follow him , but if Baal is the true God , follow him ! ” But the people said nothing .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	22	Elijah said , “ I am the only prophet of the Lord here , but there are four hundred fifty prophets of Baal .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	23	Bring two bulls . Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull and kill it and cut it into pieces . Then let them put the meat on the wood , but they are not to set fire to it . I will prepare the other bull , putting the meat on the wood but not setting fire to it .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	24	You prophets of Baal , pray to your god , and I will pray to the Lord . The god who answers by setting fire to his wood is the true God. ” All the people agreed that this was a good idea .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ There are many of you , so you go first . Choose a bull and prepare it . Pray to your god , but don ’ t start the fire. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	26	So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it . They prayed to Baal from morning until noon , shouting “ Baal , answer us ! ” But there was no sound , and no one answered . They danced around the altar they had built .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	27	At noon Elijah began to make fun of them . “ Pray louder ! ” he said . “ If Baal really is a god , maybe he is thinking , or busy , or traveling ! Maybe he is sleeping so you will have to wake him ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	28	The prophets prayed louder , cutting themselves with swords and spears until their blood flowed , which was the way they worshiped .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	29	The afternoon passed , and the prophets continued to act like this until it was time for the evening sacrifice . But no voice was heard ; Baal did not answer , and no one paid attention .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Now come to me. ” So they gathered around him , and Elijah rebuilt the altar of the Lord , which had been torn down .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	31	He took twelve stones , one stone for each of the twelve tribes , the number of Jacob ’ s sons . ( The Lord changed Jacob ’ s name to Israel . )
NCV	1%20Kings	18	32	Elijah used these stones to rebuild the altar in honor of the Lord . Then he dug a ditch around the altar that was big enough to hold about thirteen quarts of seed .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	33	Elijah put the wood on the altar , cut the bull into pieces , and laid the pieces on the wood .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	34	Then he said , “ Fill four jars with water , and pour it on the meat and on the wood. ” Then Elijah said , “ Do it again , ” and they did it again . Then he said , “ Do it a third time , ” and they did it the third time .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	35	So the water ran off the altar and filled the ditch .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	36	At the time for the evening sacrifice , the prophet Elijah went near the altar . “ Lord , you are the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , ” he prayed . “ Prove that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant . Show these people that you commanded me to do all these things .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	37	Lord , answer my prayer so these people will know that you , Lord , are God and that you will change their minds. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	38	Then fire from the Lord came down and burned the sacrifice , the wood , the stones , and the ground around the altar . It also dried up the water in the ditch .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	39	When all the people saw this , they fell down to the ground , crying , “ The Lord is God ! The Lord is God ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	40	Then Elijah said , “ Capture the prophets of Baal ! Don ’ t let any of them run away ! ” The people captured all the prophets . Then Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley , where he killed them . The Rain Comes Again
NCV	1%20Kings	18	41	Then Elijah said to Ahab , “ Now , go , eat , and drink , because a heavy rain is coming. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	42	So King Ahab went to eat and drink . At the same time Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel , where he bent down to the ground with his head between his knees .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	43	Then Elijah said to his servant , “ Go and look toward the sea. ” The servant went and looked . “ I see nothing , ” he said . Elijah told him to go and look again . This happened seven times .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	44	The seventh time , the servant said , “ I see a small cloud , the size of a human fist , coming from the sea. ” Elijah told the servant , “ Go to Ahab and tell him to get his chariot ready and go home now . Otherwise , the rain will stop him. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	18	45	After a short time the sky was covered with dark clouds . The wind began to blow , and soon a heavy rain began to fall . Ahab got in his chariot and started back to Jezreel .
NCV	1%20Kings	18	46	The Lord gave his power to Elijah , who tightened his clothes around him and ran ahead of King Ahab all the way to Jezreel . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	19	19	So Elijah left that place and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing a field with a team of oxen . He owned twelve teams of oxen and was plowing with the twelfth team . Elijah came up to Elisha , took off his coat , and put it on Elisha .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah , saying , “ May the gods punish me terribly if by this time tomorrow I don ’ t kill you just as you killed those prophets. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	3	When Elijah heard this , he was afraid and ran for his life , taking his servant with him . When they came to Beersheba in Judah , Elijah left his servant there .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	4	Then Elijah walked for a whole day into the desert . He sat down under a bush and asked to die . “ I have had enough , Lord , ” he prayed . “ Let me die . I am no better than my ancestors. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	5	Then he lay down under the tree and slept . Suddenly an angel came to him and touched him . “ Get up and eat , ” the angel said .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	6	Elijah saw near his head a loaf baked over coals and a jar of water , so he ate and drank . Then he went back to sleep .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	7	Later the Lord ’ s angel came to him a second time . The angel touched him and said , “ Get up and eat . If you don ’ t , the journey will be too hard for you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	8	So Elijah got up and ate and drank . The food made him strong enough to walk for forty days and nights to Mount Sinai , the mountain of God .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	9	There Elijah went into a cave and stayed all night . Then the Lord spoke his word to him : “ Elijah ! Why are you here ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	10	He answered , “ Lord God All-Powerful , I have always served you as well as I could . But the people of Israel have broken their agreement with you , destroyed your altars , and killed your prophets with swords . I am the only prophet left , and now they are trying to kill me , too. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	11	The Lord said to Elijah , “ Go , stand in front of me on the mountain , and I will pass by you. ” Then a very strong wind blew until it caused the mountains to fall apart and large rocks to break in front of the Lord . But the Lord was not in the wind . After the wind , there was an earthquake , but the Lord was not in the earthquake .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	12	After the earthquake , there was a fire , but the Lord was not in the fire . After the fire , there was a quiet , gentle sound .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	13	When Elijah heard it , he covered his face with his coat and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave . Then a voice said to him , “ Elijah ! Why are you here ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	14	He answered , “ Lord God All-Powerful , I have always served you as well as I could . But the people of Israel have broken their agreement with you , destroyed your altars , and killed your prophets with swords . I am the only prophet left , and now they are trying to kill me , too. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	15	The Lord said to him , “ Go back on the road that leads to the desert around Damascus . Enter that city , and pour olive oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	16	Then pour oil on Jehu son of Nimshi to make him king over Israel . Next , pour oil on Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to make him a prophet in your place .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	17	Jehu will kill anyone who escapes from Hazael ’ s sword , and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes from Jehu ’ s sword .
NCV	1%20Kings	19	18	I have seven thousand people left in Israel who have never bowed down before Baal and whose mouths have never kissed his idol. ” Elisha Becomes a Prophet
NCV	1%20Kings	19	20	Then Elisha left his oxen and ran to follow Elijah . “ Let me kiss my father and my mother good-bye , ” Elisha said . “ Then I will go with you. ” Elijah answered , “ Go back . It does not matter to me. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	19	21	So Elisha went back and took his pair of oxen and killed them . He used their wooden yoke for a fire . Then he cooked the meat and gave it to the people . After they ate it , Elisha left and followed Elijah and became his helper . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	20	20	Each officer of Israel killed the man who came against him . The men from Aram ran away as Israel chased them , but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with some of his horsemen .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	2	The king sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel . This was his message : “ Ben-Hadad says ,
NCV	1%20Kings	20	3	‘ Your silver and gold belong to me , as well as the best of your wives and children. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	4	Ahab king of Israel answered , “ My master and king , I agree to what you say . I and everything I have belong to you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	5	Then the messengers came to Ahab again . They said , “ Ben-Hadad says , ‘ I told you before that you must give me your silver and gold , your wives and your children .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	6	About this time tomorrow I will send my men , who will search everywhere in your palace and in the homes of your officers . Whatever they want they will take and carry off. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	7	Then Ahab called a meeting of all the elders of his country . He said , “ Ben-Hadad is looking for trouble . First he said I had to give him my wives , my children , my silver , and my gold , and I have not refused him. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	8	The elders and all the people said , “ Don ’ t listen to him or agree to this. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	9	So Ahab said to Ben-Hadad ’ s messengers , “ Tell my master the king : ‘ I will do what you said at first , but I can not allow this second command. ’ ” And King Ben-Hadad ’ s men carried the message back to him .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	10	Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab : “ May the gods punish me terribly if I don ’ t completely destroy Samaria . There won ’ t be enough left for each of my men to get a handful of dust ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	11	Ahab answered , “ Tell Ben-Hadad , ‘ The man who puts on his armor should not brag . It ’ s the man who lives to take it off who has the right to brag. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	12	Ben-Hadad was drinking in his tent with the other rulers when the message came from Ahab . Ben-Hadad commanded his men to prepare to attack the city , and they moved into place for battle .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	13	At the same time a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel . The prophet said , “ Ahab , the Lord says to you , ‘ Do you see that big army ? I will hand it over to you today so you will know I am the Lord. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	14	Ahab asked , “ Who will you use to defeat them ? ” The prophet answered , “ The Lord says , ‘ The young officers of the district governors will defeat them. ’ ” Then the king asked , “ Who will command the main army ? ” The prophet answered , “ You will. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	15	So Ahab gathered the young officers of the district governors , two hundred thirty-two of them . Then he called together the army of Israel , about seven thousand people in all .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	16	They marched out at noon , while Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two rulers helping him were getting drunk in their tents .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	17	The young officers of the district governors attacked first . Ben-Hadad sent out scouts who told him that soldiers were coming from Samaria .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	18	Ben-Hadad said , “ They may be coming to fight , or they may be coming to ask for peace . In either case capture them alive. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	19	The young officers of the district governors led the attack , followed by the army of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	21	Ahab king of Israel led the army and destroyed the Arameans ’ horses and chariots . King Ahab thoroughly defeated the Aramean army .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	22	Then the prophet went to Ahab king of Israel and said , “ The king of Aram will attack you again next spring . So go home now and strengthen your army and see what you need to do. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	23	Meanwhile the officers of Ben-Hadad king of Aram said to him , “ The gods of Israel are mountain gods . Since we fought in a mountain area , Israel won . Let ’ s fight them on the flat land , and then we will win .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	24	This is what you should do . Don ’ t allow the thirty-two rulers to command the armies , but put other commanders in their places .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	25	Gather an army like the one that was destroyed and as many horses and chariots as before . We will fight the Israelites on flat land , and then we will win. ” Ben-Hadad agreed with their advice and did what they said .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	26	The next spring Ben-Hadad gathered the army of Aram and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	27	The Israelites also had prepared for war . They marched out to meet the Arameans and camped opposite them . The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats , but the Arameans covered the area .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	28	A man of God came to the king of Israel with this message : “ The Lord says , ‘ The people of Aram say that I , the Lord , am a god of the mountains , not a god of the valleys . So I will allow you to defeat this huge army , and then you will know I am the Lord. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	29	The armies were camped across from each other for seven days . On the seventh day the battle began . The Israelites killed one hundred thousand Aramean soldiers in one day .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	30	The rest of them ran away to the city of Aphek , where a city wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of them . Ben-Hadad also ran away to the city and hid in a room .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	31	His officers said to him , “ We have heard that the kings of Israel are trustworthy . Let ’ s dress in rough cloth to show our sadness , and wear ropes on our heads . Then we will go to the king of Israel , and perhaps he will let you live. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	32	So they dressed in rough cloth and wore ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel . They said , “ Your servant Ben-Hadad says , ‘ Please let me live. ’ ” Ahab answered , “ Is he still alive ? He is my brother. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	33	Ben-Hadad ’ s men had wanted a sign from Ahab . So when Ahab called Ben-Hadad his brother , they quickly said , “ Yes ! Ben-Hadad is your brother. ” Ahab said , “ Bring him to me. ” When Ben-Hadad came , Ahab asked him to join him in the chariot .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	34	Ben-Hadad said to him , “ Ahab , I will give you back the cities my father took from your father . And you may put shops in Damascus , as my father did in Samaria. ” Ahab said , “ If you agree to this , I will allow you to go free. ” So the two kings made a peace agreement . Then Ahab let Ben-Hadad go free . A Prophet Speaks Against Ahab
NCV	1%20Kings	20	35	One prophet from one of the groups of prophets told another , “ Hit me ! ” He said this because the Lord had commanded it , but the other man refused .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	36	The prophet said , “ You did not obey the Lord ’ s command , so a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me. ” When the man left , a lion found him and killed him .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	37	The prophet went to another man and said , “ Hit me , please ! ” So the man hit him and hurt him .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	38	The prophet wrapped his face in a cloth so no one could tell who he was . Then he went and waited by the road for the king .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	39	As Ahab king of Israel passed by , the prophet called out to him . “ I went to fight in the battle , ” the prophet said . “ One of our men brought an enemy soldier to me . Our man said , ‘ Guard this man . If he runs away , you will have to give your life in his place . Or , you will have to pay a fine of seventy-five pounds of silver. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	20	40	But I was busy doing other things , so the man ran away. ” The king of Israel answered , “ You have already said what the punishment is . You must do what the man said. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	41	Then the prophet quickly took the cloth from his face . When the king of Israel saw him , he knew he was one of the prophets .
NCV	1%20Kings	20	42	The prophet said to the king , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ You freed the man I said should die , so your life will be taken instead of his . The lives of your people will also be taken instead of the lives of his people. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	20	43	Then King Ahab went back to his palace in Samaria , angry and upset . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	1%20Kings	20	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	21	21	So the Lord says to you , ‘ I will soon destroy you . I will kill you and every male in your family , both slave and free .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	2	One day Ahab said to Naboth , “ Give me your vineyard . It is near my palace , and I want to make it into a vegetable garden . I will give you a better vineyard in its place , or , if you prefer , I will pay you what it is worth. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	3	Naboth answered , “ May the Lord keep me from ever giving my land to you . It belongs to my family. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	4	Ahab went home angry and upset , because he did not like what Naboth from Jezreel had said . ( Naboth had said , “ I will not give you my family ’ s land. ” ) Ahab lay down on his bed , turned his face to the wall , and refused to eat .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	5	His wife , Jezebel , came in and asked him , “ Why are you so upset that you refuse to eat ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	6	Ahab answered , “ I talked to Naboth , the man from Jezreel . I said , ‘ Sell me your vineyard , or , if you prefer , I will give you another vineyard for it. ’ But Naboth refused. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	7	Jezebel answered , “ Is this how you rule as king over Israel ? Get up , eat something , and cheer up . I will get Naboth ’ s vineyard for you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	8	So Jezebel wrote some letters , signed Ahab ’ s name to them , and used his own seal to seal them . Then she sent them to the elders and important men who lived in Naboth ’ s town .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	9	The letter she wrote said : “ Declare a day during which the people are to fast . Call the people together , and give Naboth a place of honor among them .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	10	Seat two troublemakers across from him , and have them say they heard Naboth speak against God and the king . Then take Naboth out of the city and kill him with stones. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	11	The elders and important men of Jezreel obeyed Jezebel ’ s command , just as she wrote in the letters .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	12	They declared a special day on which the people were to fast . And they put Naboth in a place of honor before the people .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	13	Two troublemakers sat across from Naboth and said in front of everybody that they had heard him speak against God and the king . So the people carried Naboth out of the city and killed him with stones .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	14	Then the leaders sent a message to Jezebel , saying , “ Naboth has been killed. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been killed , she told Ahab , “ Naboth of Jezreel is dead . Now you may go and take for yourself the vineyard he would not sell to you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	16	When Ahab heard that Naboth of Jezreel was dead , he got up and went to the vineyard to take it for his own .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	17	At this time the Lord spoke his word to the prophet Elijah the Tishbite . The Lord said ,
NCV	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Go to Ahab king of Israel in Samaria . He is at Naboth ’ s vineyard , where he has gone to take it as his own .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	19	Tell Ahab that I , the Lord , say to him , ‘ You have murdered Naboth and taken his land . So I tell you this : In the same place the dogs licked up Naboth ’ s blood , they will also lick up your blood ! ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	20	When Ahab saw Elijah , he said , “ So you have found me , my enemy ! ” Elijah answered , “ Yes , I have found you . You have always chosen to do what the Lord says is wrong .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	22	Your family will be like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah . I will destroy you , because you have made me angry and have led the people of Israel to sin. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	21	23	“ And the Lord also says , ‘ Dogs will eat the body of Jezebel in the city of Jezreel. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	21	24	“ Anyone in your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs , and anyone who dies in the fields will be eaten by birds. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	21	25	There was no one like Ahab who had chosen so often to do what the Lord said was wrong , because his wife Jezebel influenced him to do evil .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	26	Ahab sinned terribly by worshiping idols , just as the Amorite people did . And the Lord had taken away their land and given it to the people of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	27	After Elijah finished speaking , Ahab tore his clothes . He put on rough cloth , fasted , and even slept in the rough cloth to show how sad and upset he was .
NCV	1%20Kings	21	28	The Lord spoke his word to Elijah the Tishbite :
NCV	1%20Kings	21	29	“ I see that Ahab is now sorry for what he has done . So I will not cause the trouble to come to him during his life , but I will wait until his son is king . Then I will bring this trouble to Ahab ’ s family. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	1%20Kings	22	1	Kings
NCV	1%20Kings	22	22	“ The Lord asked , ‘ How will you do it ? ’ “ The spirit answered , ‘ I will go to Ahab ’ s prophets and make them tell lies. ’ “ So the Lord said , ‘ You will succeed in tricking him . Go and do it. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	2	During the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to visit Ahab king of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	3	At that time Ahab asked his officers , “ Do you remember that the king of Aram took Ramoth in Gilead from us ? Why have we done nothing to get it back ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	4	So Ahab asked King Jehoshaphat , “ Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth in Gilead ? ” “ I will go with you , ” Jehoshaphat answered . “ My soldiers are yours , and my horses are yours. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	5	Jehoshaphat also said to Ahab , “ But first we should ask if this is the Lord ’ s will. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	6	Ahab called about four hundred prophets together and asked them , “ Should I go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not ? ” They answered , “ Go , because the Lord will hand them over to you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Isn ’ t there a prophet of the Lord here ? Let ’ s ask him what we should do. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	8	Then King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is one other prophet . We could ask the Lord through him , but I hate him . He never prophesies anything good about me , but something bad . He is Micaiah son of Imlah. ” Jehoshaphat said , “ King Ahab , you shouldn ’ t say that ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	9	So Ahab king of Israel told one of his officers to bring Micaiah to him at once .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	10	Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah had on their royal robes and were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor , near the entrance to the gate of Samaria . All the prophets were standing before them , speaking their messages .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	11	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made some iron horns . He said to Ahab , “ This is what the Lord says , ‘ You will use these horns to fight the Arameans until they are destroyed. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	12	All the other prophets said the same thing . “ Attack Ramoth in Gilead and win , because the Lord will hand the Arameans over to you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	13	The messenger who had gone to get Micaiah said to him , “ All the other prophets are saying King Ahab will succeed . You should agree with them and give the king a good answer. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah answered , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I can tell him only what the Lord tells me. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	15	When Micaiah came to Ahab , the king asked him , “ Micaiah , should we attack Ramoth in Gilead or not ? ” Micaiah answered , “ Attack and win ! The Lord will hand them over to you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	16	But Ahab said to Micaiah , “ How many times do I have to tell you to speak only the truth to me in the name of the Lord ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	17	So Micaiah answered , “ I saw the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd . The Lord said , ‘ They have no leaders . They should go home and not fight. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	18	Then Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , “ I told you ! He never prophesies anything good about me , but only bad. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	19	But Micaiah said , “ Hear the message from the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne with his heavenly army standing near him on his right and on his left .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	20	The Lord said , ‘ Who will trick Ahab into attacking Ramoth in Gilead where he will be killed ? ’ “ Some said one thing ; some said another .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	21	Then one spirit came and stood before the Lord and said , ‘ I will trick him. ’
NCV	1%20Kings	22	23	Micaiah said , “ Ahab , the Lord has made your prophets lie to you , and the Lord has decided that disaster should come to you. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up to Micaiah and slapped him in the face . Zedekiah said , “ Has the Lord ’ s spirit left me to speak through you ? ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	25	Micaiah answered , “ You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inside room. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	26	Then Ahab king of Israel ordered , “ Take Micaiah and send him to Amon , the governor of the city , and to Joash , the king ’ s son .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	27	Tell them I said to put this man in prison and give him only bread and water until I return safely from the battle. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	28	Micaiah said , “ Ahab , if you come back safely from battle , the Lord has not spoken through me . Remember my words , all you people ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	29	So Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	30	King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ I will go into battle , but I will wear other clothes so no one will recognize me . But you wear your royal clothes. ” So Ahab wore other clothes and went into battle .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	31	The king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders , “ Don ’ t fight with anyone—important or unimportant—except the king of Israel. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	32	When these commanders saw Jehoshaphat , they thought he was certainly the king of Israel , so they turned to attack him . But Jehoshaphat began shouting .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	33	When they saw he was not King Ahab , they stopped chasing him .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	34	By chance , a soldier shot an arrow , but he hit Ahab king of Israel between the pieces of his armor . King Ahab said to his chariot driver , “ Turn around and get me out of the battle , because I am hurt ! ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	35	The battle continued all day . King Ahab was held up in his chariot and faced the Arameans . His blood flowed down to the bottom of the chariot . That evening he died .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	36	Near sunset a cry went out through the army of Israel : “ Each man go back to his own city and land. ”
NCV	1%20Kings	22	37	In that way King Ahab died . His body was carried to Samaria and buried there .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	38	The men cleaned Ahab ’ s chariot at a pool in Samaria where prostitutes bathed , and the dogs licked his blood from the chariot . These things happened as the Lord had said they would .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	39	Everything else Ahab did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel . It tells about the palace Ahab built and decorated with ivory and the cities he built .

NCV	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king , and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years . His mother ’ s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	43	Jehoshaphat was good , like his father Asa , and he did what the Lord said was right . But Jehoshaphat did not destroy the places where gods were worshiped , so the people continued offering sacrifices and burning incense there .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	44	Jehoshaphat was at peace with the king of Israel .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	45	Jehoshaphat fought many wars , and these wars and his successes are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .
NCV	1%20Kings	22	46	There were male prostitutes still in the places of worship from the days of his father , Asa . So Jehoshaphat forced them to leave .

NCV	1%20Kings	22	48	King Jehoshaphat built trading ships to sail to Ophir for gold . But the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber , so they never set sail .

NCV	2%20Kings	1	2	Ahaziah fell down through the wooden bars in his upstairs room in Samaria and was badly hurt . He sent messengers and told them , “ Go , ask Baal-Zebub , god of Ekron , if I will recover from my injuries. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	1	After Ahab died , Moab broke away from Israel ’ s rule .
NCV	2%20Kings	1	3	But the Lord ’ s angel said to Elijah the Tishbite , “ Go up and meet the messengers sent by the king of Samaria . Ask them , ‘ Why are you going to ask questions of Baal-Zebub , god of Ekron ? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel ? ’
NCV	2%20Kings	1	4	This is what the Lord says : ‘ You will never get up from the bed you are lying on ; you will die. ’ ” Then Elijah left .
NCV	2%20Kings	1	5	When the messengers returned to Ahaziah , he asked them , “ Why have you returned ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	6	They said , “ A man came to meet us . He said , ‘ Go back to the king who sent you and tell him what the Lord says : “ Why do you send messengers to ask questions of Baal-Zebub , god of Ekron ? Is it because you think there is no God in Israel ? You will never get up from the bed you are lying on ; you will die. ” ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	7	Ahaziah asked them , “ What did the man look like who met you and told you this ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	8	They answered , “ He was a hairy man and wore a leather belt around his waist. ” Ahaziah said , “ It was Elijah the Tishbite. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	9	Then he sent a captain with his fifty men to Elijah . The captain went to Elijah , who was sitting on top of the hill , and said to him , “ Man of God , the king says , ‘ Come down ! ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	10	Elijah answered the captain , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your fifty men. ” Then fire came down from heaven and burned up the captain and his fifty men .
NCV	2%20Kings	1	11	Ahaziah sent another captain and fifty men to Elijah . The captain said to him , “ Man of God , this is what the king says : ‘ Come down quickly ! ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	12	Elijah answered , “ If I am a man of God , let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your fifty men ! ” Then fire came down from heaven and burned up the captain and his fifty men .
NCV	2%20Kings	1	13	Ahaziah then sent a third captain with his fifty men . The third captain came and fell down on his knees before Elijah and begged , “ Man of God , please respect my life and the lives of your fifty servants .
NCV	2%20Kings	1	14	See , fire came down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifty with all their men . But now , respect my life. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	15	The Lord ’ s angel said to Elijah , “ Go down with him and don ’ t be afraid of him. ” So Elijah got up and went down with him to see the king .
NCV	2%20Kings	1	16	Elijah told Ahaziah , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ You have sent messengers to ask questions of Baal-Zebub , god of Ekron . Is it because you think there is no God in Israel to ask ? Because of this , you will never get up from your bed ; you will die. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	1	17	So Ahaziah died , just as the Lord , through Elijah , had said he would . Joram became king in Ahaziah ’ s place during the second year Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was king of Judah . Joram ruled because Ahaziah had no son to take his place .

NCV	2%20Kings	2	2	Elijah said to Elisha , “ Please stay here . The Lord has told me to go to Bethel. ” But Elisha said , “ As the Lord lives , and as you live , I won ’ t leave you. ” So they went down to Bethel .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	3	The groups of prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him , “ Do you know the Lord will take your master away from you today ? ” Elisha said , “ Yes , I know , but don ’ t talk about it. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	4	Elijah said to him , “ Stay here , Elisha , because the Lord has sent me to Jericho. ” But Elisha said , “ As the Lord lives , and as you live , I won ’ t leave you. ” So they went to Jericho .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	5	The groups of prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said , “ Do you know that the Lord will take your master away from you today ? ” Elisha answered , “ Yes , I know , but don ’ t talk about it. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	6	Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here . The Lord has sent me to the Jordan River. ” Elisha answered , “ As the Lord lives , and as you live , I won ’ t leave you. ” So the two of them went on .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty men of the groups of prophets came and stood far from where Elijah and Elisha were by the Jordan .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	8	Elijah took off his coat , rolled it up , and hit the water . The water divided to the right and to the left , and Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	9	After they had crossed over , Elijah said to Elisha , “ What can I do for you before I am taken from you ? ” Elisha said , “ Leave me a double share of your spirit. ” [ a ]
NCV	2%20Kings	2	10	Elijah said , “ You have asked a hard thing . But if you see me when I am taken from you , it will be yours . If you don ’ t , it won ’ t happen. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	11	As they were walking and talking , a chariot and horses of fire appeared and separated Elijah from Elisha . Then Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	12	Elisha saw it and shouted , “ My father ! My father ! The chariots of Israel and their horsemen ! ” And Elisha did not see him anymore . Then Elisha grabbed his own clothes and tore them to show how sad he was .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	13	He picked up Elijah ’ s coat that had fallen from him . Then he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	14	Elisha hit the water with Elijah ’ s coat and said , “ Where is the Lord , the God of Elijah ? ” When he hit the water , it divided to the right and to the left , and Elisha crossed over .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	15	The groups of prophets at Jericho were watching and said , “ Elisha now has the spirit Elijah had. ” And they came to meet him , bowing down to the ground before him .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	16	They said to him , “ There are fifty strong men with us . Please let them go and look for your master . Maybe the Spirit of the Lord has taken Elijah up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley. ” But Elisha answered , “ No , don ’ t send them. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	17	When the groups of prophets had begged Elisha until he couldn ’ t refuse them anymore , he said , “ Send them. ” So they sent fifty men who looked for three days , but they could not find him .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	18	Then they came back to Elisha at Jericho where he was staying . He said to them , “ I told you not to go , didn ’ t I ? ” Elisha Makes the Water Pure
NCV	2%20Kings	2	19	The people of the city said to Elisha , “ Look , master , this city is a nice place to live as you can see . But the water is so bad the land can not grow crops. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	20	Elisha said , “ Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it. ” So they brought it to him .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	21	Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it . He said , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ I have healed this water . From now on it won ’ t cause death , and it won ’ t keep the land from growing crops. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	22	So the water has been healed to this day just as Elisha had said . Boys Make Fun of Elisha
NCV	2%20Kings	2	23	From there Elisha went up to Bethel . On the way some boys came out of the city and made fun of him . They said to him , “ Go up too , you baldhead ! Go up too , you baldhead ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	2	24	Elisha turned around , looked at them , and put a curse on them in the name of the Lord . Then two mother bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces .
NCV	2%20Kings	2	25	Elisha went to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria .

NCV	2%20Kings	3	2	He did what the Lord said was wrong , but he was not like his father and mother ; he removed the stone pillars his father had made for Baal .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	3	But he continued to sin like Jeroboam son of Nebat who had led Israel to sin . Joram did not stop doing these same sins .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	4	Mesha king of Moab raised sheep . He paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand sheep .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	5	But when Ahab died , the king of Moab turned against the king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	6	So King Joram went out from Samaria and gathered Israel ’ s army .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	7	He also sent messengers to Jehoshaphat king of Judah . “ The king of Moab has turned against me , ” he said . “ Will you go with me to fight Moab ? ” Jehoshaphat replied , “ I will go with you . My soldiers and my horses are yours. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	8	Jehoshaphat asked , “ Which way should we attack ? ” Joram answered , “ Through the Desert of Edom. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom . After they had marched seven days , there was no more water for the army or for their animals that were with them .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	10	The king of Israel said , “ This is terrible ! The Lord has called us three kings together to hand us over to the Moabites ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	11	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Is there a prophet of the Lord here ? We can ask the Lord through him. ” An officer of the king of Israel answered , “ Elisha son of Shaphat is here . He was Elijah ’ s servant. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	12	Jehoshaphat said , “ He speaks the Lord ’ s truth. ” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to see Elisha .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	13	Elisha said to the king of Israel , “ I have nothing to do with you . Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother ! ” The king of Israel said to Elisha , “ No , the Lord has called us three kings together to hand us over to the Moabites. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	14	Elisha said , “ As surely as the Lord All-Powerful lives , whom I serve , I tell you the truth . I wouldn ’ t even look at you or notice you if Jehoshaphat king of Judah were not here . I respect him .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	15	Now bring me someone who plays the harp. ” While the harp was being played , the Lord gave Elisha power .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	16	Then Elisha said , “ The Lord says to dig holes in the valley .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	17	The Lord says you won ’ t see wind or rain , but the valley will be filled with water . Then you , your cattle , and your other animals can drink .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	18	This is easy for the Lord to do ; he will also hand Moab over to you .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	19	You will destroy every strong , walled city and every important town . You will cut down every good tree and stop up all springs . You will ruin every good field with rocks. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	20	The next morning , about the time the sacrifice was offered , water came from the direction of Edom and filled the valley .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	21	All the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them . So they gathered everyone old enough to put on armor and waited at the border .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	22	But when the Moabites got up early in the morning , the sun was shining on the water . They saw the water across from them , and it looked as red as blood .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	23	Then they said , “ This is blood ! The kings must have fought and killed each other ! Come , Moabites , let ’ s take the valuables from the dead bodies ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	3	24	When the Moabites came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites came out and fought them until they ran away . Then the Israelites went on into the land , killing the Moabites .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	25	They tore down the cities and threw rocks all over every good field . They stopped up all the springs and cut down all the good trees . Kir Hareseth was the only city with its stones still in place , but the men with slingshots surrounded it and conquered it , too .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too much for him , he took seven hundred men with swords to try to break through to the king of Edom . But they could not break through .
NCV	2%20Kings	3	27	Then the king of Moab took his oldest son , who would have been king after him , and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall . So there was great anger against the Israelites , who left and went back to their own land . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Kings	4	2	Elisha answered , “ How can I help you ? Tell me , what do you have in your house ? ” The woman said , “ I don ’ t have anything there except a pot of oil. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	4	Then go into your house and shut the door behind you and your sons . Pour oil into all the jars , and set the full ones aside. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	3	Then Elisha said , “ Go and get empty jars from all your neighbors . Don ’ t ask for just a few .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	5	So she left Elisha and shut the door behind her and her sons . As they brought the jars to her , she poured out the oil .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	6	When the jars were all full , she said to her son , “ Bring me another jar. ” But he said , “ There are no more jars. ” Then the oil stopped flowing .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	7	She went and told Elisha . And the prophet said to her , “ Go , sell the oil and pay what you owe . You and your sons can live on what is left. ” The Shunammite Woman
NCV	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha went to Shunem , where an important woman lived . She begged Elisha to stay and eat . So every time Elisha passed by , he stopped there to eat .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	9	The woman said to her husband , “ I know that this is a holy man of God who passes by our house all the time .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	10	Let ’ s make a small room on the roof [ a ] and put a bed in the room for him . We can put a table , a chair , and a lampstand there . Then when he comes by , he can stay there. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	11	One day Elisha came to the woman ’ s house . After he went to his room and rested ,
NCV	2%20Kings	4	12	he said to his servant Gehazi , “ Call the Shunammite woman. ” When the servant had called her , she stood in front of him .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	13	Elisha had told his servant , “ Now say to her , ‘ You have gone to all this trouble for us . What can I do for you ? Do you want me to speak to the king or the commander of the army for you ? ’ ” She answered , “ I live among my own people. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	14	Elisha said to Gehazi , “ But what can we do for her ? ” He answered , “ She has no son , and her husband is old. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	15	Then Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Call her. ” When he called her , she stood in the doorway .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	16	Then Elisha said , “ About this time next year , you will hold a son in your arms. ” The woman said , “ No , master , man of God , don ’ t lie to me , your servant ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son at that time the next year , just as Elisha had told her .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	18	The boy grew up and one day went out to his father , who was with the grain harvesters .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	19	The boy said to his father , “ My head ! My head ! ” The father said to his servant , “ Take him to his mother ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	20	The servant took him to his mother , and he lay on his mother ’ s lap until noon . Then he died .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	21	So she took him up and laid him on Elisha ’ s bed . Then she shut the door and left .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	22	She called to her husband , “ Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys . Then I can go quickly to the man of God and return. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	23	The husband said , “ Why do you want to go to him today ? It isn ’ t the New Moon or the Sabbath day. ” She said , “ It will be all right. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	24	Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant , “ Lead on . Don ’ t slow down for me unless I tell you. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	25	So she went to Elisha , the man of God , at Mount Carmel . When he saw her coming from far away , he said to his servant Gehazi , “ Look , there ’ s the Shunammite woman !
NCV	2%20Kings	4	26	Run to meet her and ask , ‘ Are you all right ? Is your husband all right ? Is the boy all right ? ’ ” She answered , “ Everything is all right. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	27	Then she came to Elisha at the hill and grabbed his feet . Gehazi came near to pull her away , but Elisha said to him , “ Leave her alone . She ’ s very upset , and the Lord has not told me about it . He has hidden it from me. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	28	She said , “ Master , did I ask you for a son ? Didn ’ t I tell you not to lie to me ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	29	Then Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Get ready . Take my walking stick in your hand and go quickly . If you meet anyone , don ’ t say hello . If anyone greets you , don ’ t respond . Lay my walking stick on the boy ’ s face. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	30	The boy ’ s mother said , “ As surely as the Lord lives and as you live , I won ’ t leave you ! ” So Elisha got up and followed her .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the walking stick on the boy ’ s face , but the boy did not talk or move . Then Gehazi went back to meet Elisha . “ The boy has not awakened , ” he said .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	32	When Elisha came into the house , the boy was lying dead on his bed .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	33	Elisha entered the room and shut the door , so only he and the boy were in the room . Then he prayed to the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	34	He went to the bed and lay on the boy , putting his mouth on the boy ’ s mouth , his eyes on the boy ’ s eyes , and his hands on the boy ’ s hands . He stretched himself out on top of the boy . Soon the boy ’ s skin became warm .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	35	Elisha turned away and walked around the room . Then he went back and put himself on the boy again . The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	36	Elisha called Gehazi and said , “ Call the Shunammite ! ” So he did . When she came , Elisha said , “ Pick up your son. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	37	She came in and fell at Elisha ’ s feet , bowing facedown to the floor . Then she picked up her son and went out . Elisha and the Stew
NCV	2%20Kings	4	38	When Elisha returned to Gilgal , there was a shortage of food in the land . While the groups of prophets were sitting in front of him , he said to his servant , “ Put the large pot on the fire , and boil some stew for these men. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	39	One of them went out into the field to gather plants . Finding a wild vine , he picked fruit from the vine and filled his robe with it . Then he came and cut up the fruit into the pot . But they didn ’ t know what kind of fruit it was .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	40	They poured out the stew for the others to eat . When they began to eat it , they shouted , “ Man of God , there ’ s death in the pot ! ” And they could not eat it .
NCV	2%20Kings	4	41	Elisha told them to bring some flour . He threw it into the pot and said , “ Pour it out for the people to eat. ” Then there was nothing harmful in the pot . Elisha Feeds the People
NCV	2%20Kings	4	42	A man from Baal Shalishah came to Elisha , bringing him twenty loaves of barley bread from the first harvest . He also brought fresh grain in his sack . Elisha said , “ Give it to the people to eat. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	43	Elisha ’ s servant asked , “ How can I feed a hundred people with so little ? ” “ Give the bread to the people to eat , ” Elisha said . “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ They will eat and will have food left over. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	4	44	After he gave it to them , the people ate and had food left over , as the Lord had said . Footnotes - 4:10 roof In Bible times houses were built with flat roofs .

NCV	2%20Kings	5	2	The Arameans had gone out to raid the Israelites and had taken a little girl as a captive . This little girl served Naaman ’ s wife .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	5	The king of Aram said , “ Go ahead , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. ” So Naaman left and took with him about seven hundred fifty pounds of silver , as well as one hundred fifty pounds of gold and ten changes of clothes .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	3	She said to her mistress , “ I wish my master would meet the prophet who lives in Samaria . He would cure him of his disease. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	4	Naaman went to the king and told him what the girl from Israel had said .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel , which read , “ I am sending my servant Naaman to you so you can heal him of his skin disease. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	7	When the king of Israel read the letter , he tore his clothes to show how upset he was . He said , “ I ’ m not God ! I can ’ t kill and make alive again ! Why does this man send someone with a skin disease for me to heal ? You can see that the king of Aram is trying to start trouble with me. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	8	When Elisha , the man of God , heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , he sent the king this message : “ Why have you torn your clothes ? Let Naaman come to me . Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	9	So Naaman went with his horses and chariots to Elisha ’ s house and stood outside the door .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent Naaman a messenger who said , “ Go and wash in the Jordan River seven times . Then your skin will be healed , and you will be clean. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	11	Naaman became angry and left . He said , “ I thought Elisha would surely come out and stand before me and call on the name of the Lord his God . I thought he would wave his hand over the place and heal the disease .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	12	The Abana and the Pharpar , the rivers of Damascus , are better than all the waters of Israel . Why can ’ t I wash in them and become clean ? ” So Naaman went away very angry .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	13	Naaman ’ s servants came near and said to him , “ My father , if the prophet had told you to do some great thing , wouldn ’ t you have done it ? Doesn ’ t it make more sense just to do it ? After all , he only told you , ‘ Wash , and you will be clean. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	14	So Naaman went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times , just as Elisha had said . Then his skin became new again , like the skin of a child . And he was clean .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	15	Naaman and all his group returned to Elisha . He stood before Elisha and said , “ Look , I now know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel . Now please accept a gift from me. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	16	But Elisha said , “ As surely as the Lord lives whom I serve , I won ’ t accept anything. ” Naaman urged him to take the gift , but he refused .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	17	Then Naaman said , “ If you won ’ t take the gift , then please give me some soil—as much as two of my mules can carry . From now on I ’ ll not offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other gods but the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	18	But let the Lord pardon me for this : When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon [ a ] to worship , he leans on my arm . Then I must bow in that temple . May the Lord pardon me when I do that. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	19	Elisha said to him , “ Go in peace. ” Naaman left Elisha and went a short way .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	20	Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , thought , “ My master has not accepted what Naaman the Aramean brought . As surely as the Lord lives , I ’ ll run after him and get something from him. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	21	So Gehazi went after Naaman . When Naaman saw someone running after him , he got off the chariot to meet Gehazi . He asked , “ Is everything all right ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	22	Gehazi said , “ Everything is all right . My master has sent me . He said , ‘ Two young men from the groups of prophets in the mountains of Ephraim just came to me . Please give them seventy-five pounds of silver and two changes of clothes. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	5	23	Naaman said , “ Please take one hundred fifty pounds , ” and he urged Gehazi to take it . He tied one hundred fifty pounds of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes . Then he gave them to two of his servants to carry for Gehazi .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	24	When they came to the hill , Gehazi took these things from Naaman ’ s servants and put them in the house . Then he let Naaman ’ s servants go , and they left .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	25	When he came in and stood before his master , Elisha said to him , “ Where have you been , Gehazi ? ” “ I didn ’ t go anywhere , ” he answered .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	26	But Elisha said to him , “ My spirit was with you . I knew when the man turned from his chariot to meet you . This isn ’ t a time to take money , clothes , olives , grapes , sheep , oxen , male servants , or female servants .
NCV	2%20Kings	5	27	So Naaman ’ s skin disease will come on you and your children forever. ” When Gehazi left Elisha , he had the disease and was as white as snow .

NCV	2%20Kings	6	2	Let ’ s go to the Jordan River . There everyone can get a log , and let ’ s build a place there to live. ” Elisha said , “ Go. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	6	Elisha asked , “ Where did it fall ? ” The man showed him the place . Then Elisha cut down a stick and threw it into the water , and it made the iron head float .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	3	One of them said , “ Please go with us. ” Elisha answered , “ I will go , ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	4	so he went with them . When they arrived at the Jordan , they cut down some trees .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	5	As one man was cutting down a tree , the head of his ax fell into the water . He yelled , “ Oh , my master ! I borrowed that ax ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	7	Elisha said , “ Pick up the axhead. ” Then the man reached out and took it . Elisha and the Blinded Arameans
NCV	2%20Kings	6	8	The king of Aram was at war with Israel . He had a council meeting with his officers and said , “ I will set up my camp in this place. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	9	Elisha , the man of God , sent a message to the king of Israel , saying , “ Be careful ! Don ’ t pass that place , because the Arameans are going down there ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	10	The king of Israel checked the place about which Elisha had warned him . Elisha warned him several times , so the king protected himself there .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	11	The king of Aram was angry about this . He called his officers together and demanded , “ Tell me who of us is working for the king of Israel. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	12	One of the officers said , “ None , my master and king . It ’ s Elisha , the prophet from Israel . He can tell you what you speak in your bedroom. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	13	The king said , “ Go and find him so I can send men and catch him. ” The servants came back and reported , “ He is in Dothan. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	14	Then the king sent horses , chariots , and many troops to Dothan . They arrived at night and surrounded the city .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	15	Elisha ’ s servant got up early , and when he went out , he saw an army with horses and chariots all around the city . The servant said to Elisha , “ Oh , my master , what can we do ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	16	Elisha said , “ Don ’ t be afraid . The army that fights for us is larger than the one against us. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	17	Then Elisha prayed , “ Lord , open my servant ’ s eyes , and let him see. ” The Lord opened the eyes of the young man , and he saw that the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	18	As the enemy came down toward Elisha , he prayed to the Lord , “ Make these people blind. ” So he made the Aramean army blind , as Elisha had asked .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	19	Elisha said to them , “ This is not the right road or the right city . Follow me and I ’ ll take you to the man you are looking for. ” Then Elisha led them to Samaria .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	20	After they entered Samaria , Elisha said , “ Lord , open these men ’ s eyes so they can see. ” So the Lord opened their eyes , and the Aramean army saw that they were inside the city of Samaria !
NCV	2%20Kings	6	21	When the king of Israel saw the Aramean army , he said to Elisha , “ My father , should I kill them ? Should I kill them ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	22	Elisha answered , “ Don ’ t kill them . You wouldn ’ t kill people whom you captured with your sword and bow . Give them food and water , and let them eat and drink and then go home to their master. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	23	So he prepared a great feast for the Aramean army . After they ate and drank , the king sent them away , and they went home to their master . The soldiers of Aram did not come anymore into the land of Israel . A Shortage of Food
NCV	2%20Kings	6	24	Later , Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered his whole army and surrounded and attacked Samaria .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	25	There was a shortage of food in Samaria . It was so bad that a donkey ’ s head sold for about two pounds of silver , and half of a pint of dove ’ s dung sold for about two ounces of silver .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall , a woman yelled out to him , “ Help me , my master and king ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	27	The king said , “ If the Lord doesn ’ t help you , how can I ? Can I get help from the threshing floor or from the winepress ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	28	Then the king said to her , “ What is your trouble ? ” She answered , “ This woman said to me , ‘ Give up your son so we can eat him today . Then we will eat my son tomorrow. ’
NCV	2%20Kings	6	29	So we boiled my son and ate him . Then the next day I said to her , ‘ Give up your son so we can eat him. ’ But she had hidden him. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	30	When the king heard the woman ’ s words , he tore his clothes in grief . As he walked along the wall , the people looked and saw he had on rough cloth under his clothes to show his sadness .
NCV	2%20Kings	6	31	He said , “ May God punish me terribly if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat isn ’ t cut off from his body today ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	32	The king sent a messenger to Elisha , who was sitting in his house with the elders . But before the messenger arrived , Elisha said to them , “ See , this murderer is sending men to cut off my head . When the messenger arrives , shut the door and hold it ; don ’ t let him in . The sound of his master ’ s feet is behind him. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	6	33	Elisha was still talking with the leaders when the messenger arrived . The king said , “ This trouble has come from the Lord . Why should I wait for the Lord any longer ? ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Kings	7	2	Then the officer who was close to the king answered Elisha , “ Even if the Lord opened windows in the sky , that couldn ’ t happen. ” Elisha said , “ You will see it with your eyes , but you will not eat any of it. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	7	So they got up and ran away in the twilight , leaving their tents , horses , and donkeys . They left the camp standing and ran for their lives .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	3	There were four men with a skin disease at the entrance to the city gate . They said to each other , “ Why do we sit here until we die ?
NCV	2%20Kings	7	4	There is no food in the city . So if we go into the city , we will die there . If we stay here , we will die . So let ’ s go to the Aramean camp . If they let us live , we will live . If they kill us , we die. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	5	So they got up at twilight and went to the Aramean camp , but when they arrived , no one was there .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	6	The Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the sound of chariots , horses , and a large army . They had said to each other , “ The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	8	When the men with the skin disease came to the edge of the camp , they went into one of the tents and ate and drank . They carried silver , gold , and clothes out of the camp and hid them . Then they came back and entered another tent . They carried things from this tent and hid them , also .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	9	Then they said to each other , “ We ’ re doing wrong . Today we have good news , but we are silent . If we wait until the sun comes up , we ’ ll be discovered . Let ’ s go right now and tell the people in the king ’ s palace. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	10	So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city . They said , “ We went to the Aramean camp , but no one is there ; we didn ’ t hear anyone . The horses and donkeys were still tied up , and the tents were still standing. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	11	Then the gatekeepers shouted out and told the people in the palace .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	12	The king got up in the night and said to his officers , “ I ’ ll tell you what the Arameans are doing to us . They know we are starving . They have gone out of the camp to hide in the field . They ’ re saying , ‘ When the Israelites come out of the city , we ’ ll capture them alive . Then we ’ ll enter the city. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	13	One of his officers answered , “ Let some men take five of the horses that are still left in the city . These men are like all the Israelites who are left ; they are also about to die . Let ’ s send them to see what has happened. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	14	So the men took two chariots with horses . The king sent them after the Aramean army , saying , “ Go and see what has happened. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	15	The men followed the Aramean army as far as the Jordan River . The road was full of clothes and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away as they had hurriedly left . So the messengers returned and told the king .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	16	Then the people went out and took valuables from the Aramean camp . So seven quarts of fine flour were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver , and thirteen quarts of barley were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver , just as the Lord had said .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	17	The king chose the officer who was close to him to guard the gate , but the people trampled the officer to death . This happened just as Elisha had told the king when the king came to his house .
NCV	2%20Kings	7	18	He had said , “ Thirteen quarts of barley and seven quarts of fine flour will each sell for two-fifths of an ounce of silver about this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	19	But the officer had answered , “ Even if the Lord opened windows in the sky , that couldn ’ t happen. ” And Elisha had told him , “ You will see it with your eyes , but you won ’ t eat any of it. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	7	20	It happened to the officer just that way . The people trampled him in the gateway , and he died . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Kings	8	2	So the woman got up and did as the man of God had said . She left with her family , and they stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	8	The king said to Hazael , “ Take a gift in your hand and go meet him . Ask the Lord through him if I will recover from my sickness. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	3	After seven years she returned from the land of the Philistines and went to beg the king for her house and land .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	4	The king was talking with Gehazi , the servant of the man of God . The king had said , “ Please tell me all the great things Elisha has done. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	5	Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life . Just then the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came and begged the king for her house and land . Gehazi said , “ My master and king , this is the woman , and this is the son Elisha brought back to life. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	6	The king asked the woman , and she told him about it . Then the king chose an officer to help her . “ Give the woman everything that is hers , ” the king said . “ Give her all the money made from her land from the day she left until now. ” Ben-Hadad Is Killed
NCV	2%20Kings	8	7	Then Elisha went to Damascus , where Ben-Hadad king of Aram was sick . Someone told him , “ The man of God has arrived. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	9	So Hazael went to meet Elisha , taking with him a gift of forty camels loaded with every good thing in Damascus . He came and stood before Elisha and said , “ Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram sent me to you . He asks if he will recover from his sickness. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	10	Elisha said to Hazael , “ Go and tell Ben-Hadad , ‘ You will surely recover , ’ but the Lord has told me he will really die. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	11	Hazael stared at Elisha until he felt ashamed . Then Elisha cried .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	12	Hazael asked , “ Why are you crying , master ? ” Elisha answered , “ Because I know what evil you will do to the Israelites . You will burn their strong , walled cities with fire and kill their young men with swords . You will throw their babies to the ground and split open their pregnant women. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	13	Hazael said , “ Am I a dog ? How could I do such things ? ” Elisha answered , “ The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Aram. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	14	Then Hazael left Elisha and came to his master . Ben-Hadad said to him , “ What did Elisha say to you ? ” Hazael answered , “ He told me that you will surely recover. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	8	15	But the next day Hazael took a blanket and dipped it in water . Then he put it over Ben-Hadad ’ s face , and he died . So Hazael became king in Ben-Hadad ’ s place . Jehoram King of Judah
NCV	2%20Kings	8	16	While Jehoshaphat was king in Judah , Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah . This was during the fifth year Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	17	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to rule , and he ruled eight years in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	18	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel , just as the family of Ahab had done , because he married Ahab ’ s daughter . Jehoram did what the Lord said was wrong .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	19	But the Lord would not destroy Judah because of his servant David . The Lord had promised that one of David ’ s descendants would always rule .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	20	In Jehoram ’ s time Edom broke away from Judah ’ s rule and chose their own king .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	21	So Jehoram and all his chariots went to Zair . The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders . Jehoram got up and attacked the Edomites at night , but his army ran away to their tents .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	22	From then until now the country of Edom has fought against the rule of Judah . At the same time Libnah also broke away from Judah ’ s rule .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	23	The other acts of Jehoram and all the things he did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	24	Jehoram died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem , and Jehoram ’ s son Ahaziah ruled in his place .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	25	Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah during the twelfth year Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he ruled one year in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Athaliah , a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	27	Ahaziah followed the ways of Ahab ’ s family . He did what the Lord said was wrong , as Ahab ’ s family had done , because he was a son-in-law to Ahab .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	28	Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to Ramoth in Gilead , where they fought against Hazael king of Aram . The Arameans wounded Joram .
NCV	2%20Kings	8	29	So King Joram returned to Jezreel to heal from the wound he had received from the Arameans at Ramoth when he fought Hazael king of Aram .

NCV	2%20Kings	9	2	When you arrive , find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , the son of Nimshi . Go in and make Jehu get up from among his brothers , and take him to an inner room .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	9	I will make Ahab ’ s family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	3	Then take the bottle and pour the oil on Jehu ’ s head and say , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I have appointed you king over Israel. ’ Then open the door and run away . Don ’ t wait ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young man , the prophet , went to Ramoth in Gilead .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	5	When he arrived , he saw the officers of the army sitting together . He said , “ Commander , I have a message for you. ” Jehu asked , “ For which one of us ? ” The young man said , “ For you , commander. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	6	Jehu got up and went into the house . Then the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu ’ s head and said to him , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel says : ‘ I have appointed you king over the Lord ’ s people Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	7	You must destroy the family of Ahab your master . I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants the prophets and for all the Lord ’ s servants who were murdered .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	8	All of Ahab ’ s family must die . I will not let any male child in Ahab ’ s family live in Israel , whether slave or free .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	10	The dogs will eat Jezebel at Jezreel , and no one will bury her. ’ ” Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	11	When Jehu went back to his master ’ s officers , one of them said to Jehu , “ Is everything all right ? Why did this crazy man come to you ? ” Jehu answered , “ You know the man and how he talks. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	12	They answered , “ That ’ s not true . Tell us. ” Jehu said , “ He said to me , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I have appointed you to be king over Israel. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	13	Then the officers hurried , and each man took off his own coat and put it on the stairs for Jehu . They blew the trumpet and shouted , “ Jehu is king ! ” Joram and Ahaziah Are Killed
NCV	2%20Kings	9	14	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat , the son of Nimshi , made plans against Joram . Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth in Gilead from Hazael king of Aram .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	15	But King Joram had to return to Jezreel to heal from the injuries the Arameans had given him when he fought against Hazael king of Aram . Jehu said , “ If you agree with this , don ’ t let anyone leave the city . They might tell the news in Jezreel. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	16	Then he got into his chariot and set out for Jezreel , where Joram was resting . Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	17	The lookout was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel when he saw Jehu ’ s troops coming . He said , “ I see some soldiers ! ” Joram said , “ Take a horseman and send him to meet them . Tell him to ask , ‘ Is all in order ? ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	18	The horseman rode out to meet Jehu , and he said , “ This is what the king says : ‘ Is all in order ? ’ ” Jehu said , “ Why bother yourself with order ? Come along behind me. ” The lookout reported , “ The messenger reached them , but he is not coming back. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	19	Then Joram sent out a second horseman . This rider came to Jehu ’ s group and said , “ This is what the king says : ‘ Is all in order ? ’ ” Jehu answered , “ Why bother yourself with order ? Come along behind me. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	20	The lookout reported , “ The second man reached them , but he is not coming back . The man in the chariot is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi . He drives as if he were crazy ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	21	Joram said , “ Get my chariot ready. ” Then the servant got Joram ’ s chariot ready . Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out , each in his own chariot , to meet Jehu at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	22	When Joram saw Jehu , he said , “ Is all in order , Jehu ? ” Jehu answered , “ There will never be any order as long as your mother Jezebel worships idols and uses witchcraft. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	23	Joram turned the horses to run away and yelled to Ahaziah , “ It ’ s a trick , Ahaziah ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	24	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders . The arrow went through Joram ’ s heart , and he fell down in his chariot .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	25	Jehu ordered Bidkar , his chariot officer , “ Pick up Joram ’ s body , and throw it into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite . Remember when you and I rode together with Joram ’ s father Ahab . The Lord made this prophecy against him :
NCV	2%20Kings	9	26	‘ Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons , says the Lord , so I will punish Ahab in his field , says the Lord. ’ Take Joram ’ s body and throw it into the field , as the Lord has said. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	27	When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this , he ran away toward Beth Haggan . Jehu chased him , saying , “ Shoot Ahaziah , too ! ” Ahaziah was wounded in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam . He got as far as Megiddo but died there .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	28	Ahaziah ’ s servants carried his body in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in Jerusalem .

NCV	2%20Kings	9	30	When Jehu came to Jezreel , Jezebel heard about it . She put on her eye makeup and fixed her hair . Then she looked out the window .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	31	When Jehu entered the city gate , Jezebel said , “ Have you come in peace , you Zimri , [ a ] you who killed your master ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	32	Jehu looked up at the window and said , “ Who is on my side ? Who ? ” Two or three servants looked out the window at Jehu .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	33	He said to them , “ Throw her down. ” So they threw Jezebel down , and the horses ran over her . Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	34	Jehu went into the house and ate and drank . Then he said , “ Now see about this cursed woman . Bury her , because she is a king ’ s daughter. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	9	35	The men went to bury Jezebel , but they could not find her . They found only her skull , feet , and the palms of her hands .
NCV	2%20Kings	9	36	When they came back and told Jehu , he said , “ The Lord said this through his servant Elijah the Tishbite : ‘ The dogs will eat Jezebel at Jezreel .

NCV	2%20Kings	10	2	“ You have your master ’ s sons with you , and you have chariots , horses , a city with strong walls , and weapons . When you get this letter ,
NCV	2%20Kings	10	10	You should know that everything the Lord said about Ahab ’ s family will come true . The Lord has spoken through his servant Elijah , and the Lord has done what he said. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	3	choose the best and most worthy person among your master ’ s sons , and make him king . Then fight for your master ’ s family. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	4	But the officers and leaders of Jezreel were frightened . They said , “ Two kings could not stand up to Jehu , so how can we ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	5	The palace manager , the city governor , the leaders , and the guardians sent a message to Jehu . “ We are your servants , ” they said . “ We will do everything you tell us to do . We won ’ t make any man king , so do whatever you think is best. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	6	Then Jehu wrote a second letter , saying , “ If you are on my side and will obey me , cut off the heads of your master ’ s sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time. ” Now the seventy sons of the king ’ s family were with the leading men of the city who were their guardians .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	7	When the leaders received the letter , they took the king ’ s sons and killed all seventy of them . They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	8	The messenger came to Jehu and told him , “ They have brought the heads of the king ’ s sons. ” Then Jehu said , “ Lay the heads in two piles at the city gate until morning. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	9	In the morning , Jehu went out and stood before the people and said to them , “ You are innocent . Look , I made plans against my master and killed him . But who killed all these ?
NCV	2%20Kings	10	11	So Jehu killed everyone of Ahab ’ s family in Jezreel who was still alive . He also killed all Ahab ’ s leading men , close friends , and priests . No one who had helped Ahab was left alive .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	12	Then Jehu left and went to Samaria by way of the road to Beth Eked of the Shepherds .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	13	There Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah . Jehu asked , “ Who are you ? ” They answered , “ We are relatives of Ahaziah . We have come down to get revenge for the families of the king and the king ’ s mother. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	14	Then Jehu said , “ Take them alive ! ” So they captured Ahaziah ’ s relatives alive and killed them at the well near Beth Eked—forty-two of them . Jehu did not leave anyone alive .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	15	After Jehu left there , he met Jehonadab son of Recab , who was also on his way to meet Jehu . Jehu greeted him and said , “ Are you as good a friend to me as I am to you ? ” Jehonadab answered , “ Yes , I am. ” Jehu said , “ If you are , then give me your hand. ” So Jehonadab gave him his hand , and Jehu pulled him into the chariot .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	16	“ Come with me , ” Jehu said . “ You can see how strong my feelings are for the Lord. ” So Jehu had Jehonadab ride in his chariot .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	17	When Jehu came to Samaria , he killed all of Ahab ’ s family in Samaria . He destroyed all those who were left , just as the Lord had told Elijah it would happen . Baal Worshipers Killed

NCV	2%20Kings	10	19	Now call for me all Baal ’ s prophets and priests and all the people who worship Baal . Don ’ t let anyone miss this meeting , because I have a great sacrifice for Baal . Anyone who is not there will not live. ” But Jehu was tricking them so he could destroy the worshipers of Baal .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	20	He said , “ Prepare a holy meeting for Baal. ” So they announced the meeting .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	21	Then Jehu sent word through all Israel , and all the worshipers of Baal came ; not one stayed home . They came into the temple of Baal , and the temple was filled from one side to the other .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	22	Jehu said to the man who kept the robes , “ Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal. ” After he brought out robes for them ,
NCV	2%20Kings	10	23	Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal . Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal , “ Look around , and make sure there are no servants of the Lord with you . Be sure there are only worshipers of Baal. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	24	Then the worshipers of Baal went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings . Jehu had eighty men waiting outside . He had told them , “ Don ’ t let anyone escape . If you do , you must pay with your own life. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	25	As soon as Jehu finished offering the burnt offering , he ordered the guards and the captains , “ Go in and kill the worshipers of Baal . Don ’ t let anyone come out. ” So the guards and captains killed the worshipers of Baal with the sword and threw their bodies out . Then they went to the inner rooms of the temple
NCV	2%20Kings	10	26	and brought out the pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	27	They tore down the stone pillar of Baal , as well as the temple of Baal . And they made it into a sewage pit , as it is today .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	28	So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel ,
NCV	2%20Kings	10	29	but he did not stop doing the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done . Jeroboam had led Israel to sin by worshiping the golden calves in Bethel and Dan .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	30	The Lord said to Jehu , “ You have done well in obeying what I said was right . You have done to the family of Ahab as I wanted . Because of this , your descendants as far as your great-great-grandchildren will be kings of Israel. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu was not careful to follow the teachings of the Lord , the God of Israel , with all his heart . He did not stop doing the same sins Jeroboam had done , by which he had led Israel to sin .
NCV	2%20Kings	10	32	At that time the Lord began to make Israel smaller . Hazael defeated the Israelites in all the land of Israel ,
NCV	2%20Kings	10	33	taking all the land of the Jordan known as the land of Gilead . ( It was the region of Gad , Reuben , and Manasseh . ) He took land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine through Gilead to Bashan .

NCV	2%20Kings	11	2	But Jehosheba , King Jehoram ’ s daughter and Ahaziah ’ s sister , took Joash , Ahaziah ’ s son . She stole him from among the other sons of the king who were about to be murdered . She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah , so he was not killed .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	11	Then each guard took his place with his weapons in his hand . There were guards from the south side of the Temple to the north side . They stood by the altar and the Temple and around the king .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	3	He hid with her in the Temple of the Lord for six years . During that time Athaliah ruled the land .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	4	In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of groups of a hundred men , as well as the Carites . [ a ] He brought them together in the Temple of the Lord and made an agreement with them . There , in the Temple of the Lord , he made them promise loyalty , and then he showed them the king ’ s son .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	5	He commanded them , “ This is what you must do . A third of you who go on duty on the Sabbath will guard the king ’ s palace .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	6	A third of you will be at the Sur Gate , and another third will be at the gate behind the guard . This way you will guard the Temple .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	7	The two groups who go off duty on the Sabbath must protect the Temple of the Lord for the king .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	8	All of you must stand around the king , with weapons in hand . Kill anyone who comes near . Stay close to the king when he goes out and when he comes in. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	11	9	The commanders over a hundred men obeyed everything Jehoiada the priest had commanded . Each one took his men who came on duty on the Sabbath and those who went off duty on the Sabbath , and they came to Jehoiada the priest .

NCV	2%20Kings	11	13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guards and the people , she went to them at the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	14	She looked , and there was the king , standing by the pillar , as the custom was . The officers and trumpeters were standing beside him , and all the people of the land were very happy and were blowing trumpets . Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed , “ Traitors ! Traitors ! ”
NCV	2%20Kings	11	15	Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the commanders of a hundred men , who led the army . He said , “ Surround her with soldiers and kill with a sword anyone who follows her. ” He commanded this because he had said , “ Don ’ t put Athaliah to death in the Temple of the Lord. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	11	16	So they caught her when she came to the horses ’ entrance near the palace . There she was put to death .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	17	Then Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and the king and the people that they would be the Lord ’ s special people . He also made an agreement between the king and the people .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	18	All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down , smashing the altars and idols . They also killed Mattan , the priest of Baal , in front of the altars . Then Jehoiada the priest placed guards at the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	19	He took with him the commanders of a hundred men and the Carites , the royal bodyguards , as well as the guards and all the people of the land . Together they took the king out of the Temple of the Lord and went into the palace through the gate of the guards . Then the king sat on the royal throne .
NCV	2%20Kings	11	20	So all the people of the land were very happy , and Jerusalem had peace , because Athaliah had been put to death with the sword at the palace .

NCV	2%20Kings	12	6	But by the twenty-third year Joash was king , the priests still had not repaired the Temple .
NCV	2%20Kings	12	7	So King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them , “ Why aren ’ t you repairing the damage of the Temple ? Don ’ t take any more money from the people you serve , but hand over the money for the repair of the Temple. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	12	8	The priests agreed not to take any more money from the people and not to repair the Temple themselves .
NCV	2%20Kings	12	9	Jehoiada the priest took a box and made a hole in the top of it . Then he put it by the altar , on the right side as the people came into the Temple of the Lord . The priests guarding the doorway put all the money brought to the Temple of the Lord into the box .
NCV	2%20Kings	12	10	Each time the priests saw that the box was full of money , the king ’ s royal secretary and the high priest came . They counted the money that had been brought to the Temple of the Lord , and they put it into bags .
NCV	2%20Kings	12	11	Next they weighed the money and gave it to the people in charge of the work on the Temple . With it they paid the carpenters and the builders who worked on the Temple of the Lord ,

NCV	2%20Kings	12	14	They paid the money to the workers , who used it to repair the Temple of the Lord .

NCV	2%20Kings	16	2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king , and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem . Unlike his ancestor David , he did not do what the Lord his God said was right .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	16	So Uriah the priest did everything as King Ahaz commanded him .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	3	Ahaz did the same things the kings of Israel had done . He even made his son pass through fire . He did the same hateful sins as the nations had done whom the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	4	Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the places where gods were worshiped , on the hills , and under every green tree .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	5	Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah , the king of Israel , came up to attack Jerusalem . They surrounded Ahaz but could not defeat him .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	6	At that time Rezin king of Aram took back the city of Elath for Aram , and he forced out all the people of Judah . Then Edomites moved into Elath , and they still live there today .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	7	Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria , saying , “ I am your servant and your friend . Come and save me from the king of Aram and the king of Israel , who are attacking me. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	16	8	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was in the Temple of the Lord and in the treasuries of the palace , and he sent these as a gift to the king of Assyria .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	9	So the king of Assyria listened to Ahaz . He attacked Damascus and captured it and sent all its people away to Kir . And he killed Rezin .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria . Ahaz saw an altar at Damascus , and he sent plans and a pattern of this altar to Uriah the priest .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	11	So Uriah the priest built an altar , just like the plans King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus . Uriah finished the altar before King Ahaz came back from Damascus .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	12	When the king arrived from Damascus , he saw the altar and went near and offered sacrifices on it .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	13	He burned his burnt offerings and grain offerings and poured out his drink offering . He also sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	14	Ahaz moved the bronze altar that was before the Lord at the front of the Temple . It was between Ahaz ’ s altar and the Temple of the Lord , but he put it on the north side of his altar .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	15	King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest , “ On the large altar burn the morning burnt offering , the evening grain offering , the king ’ s burnt offering and grain offering , and the whole burnt offering , the grain offering , and the drink offering for all the people of the land . Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offering and of the sacrifice . But I will use the bronze altar to ask questions of God. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	16	17	Then King Ahaz took off the side panels from the bases and removed the washing bowls from the top of the bases . He also took the large bowl , which was called the Sea , off the bronze bulls that held it up , and he put it on a stone base .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	18	Ahaz took away the platform for the royal throne , which had been built at the Temple of the Lord . He also took away the outside entrance for the king . He did these things because of the king of Assyria .
NCV	2%20Kings	16	19	The other things Ahaz did as king are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .

NCV	2%20Kings	17	2	He did what the Lord said was wrong , but he was not as bad as the kings of Israel who had ruled before him .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	17	They made their sons and daughters pass through fire and tried to find out the future by magic and witchcraft . They always chose to do what the Lord said was wrong , which made him angry .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came to attack Hoshea . Hoshea had been Shalmaneser ’ s servant and had made the payments to Shalmaneser that he had demanded .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	4	But the king of Assyria found out that Hoshea had made plans against him by sending messengers to So , the king of Egypt . Hoshea had also stopped giving Shalmaneser the payments , which he had paid every year in the past . For that , the king put Hoshea in prison .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	5	Then the king of Assyria came and attacked all the land of Israel . He surrounded Samaria and attacked it for three years .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	6	He defeated Samaria in the ninth year Hoshea was king , and he took the Israelites away to Assyria . He settled them in Halah , in Gozan on the Habor River , and in the cities of the Medes . Israelites Punished for Sin
NCV	2%20Kings	17	7	All these things happened because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God . He had brought them out of Egypt and had rescued them from the power of the king of Egypt , but the Israelites had honored other gods .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	8	They lived like the nations the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of them . They lived as their evil kings had shown them ,
NCV	2%20Kings	17	9	secretly sinning against the Lord their God . They built places to worship gods in all their cities , from the watchtower to the strong , walled city .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	10	They put up stone pillars to gods and Asherah idols on every high hill and under every green tree .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	11	The Israelites burned incense everywhere gods were worshiped , just as the nations who lived there before them had done , whom the Lord had forced out of the land . The Israelites did wicked things that made the Lord angry .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	12	They served idols when the Lord had said , “ You must not do this. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	17	13	The Lord used every prophet and seer to warn Israel and Judah . He said , “ Stop your evil ways and obey my commands and laws . Follow all the teachings that I commanded your ancestors , the teachings that I gave you through my servants the prophets. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	17	14	But the people would not listen . They were stubborn , just as their ancestors had been who did not believe in the Lord their God .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	15	They rejected the Lord ’ s laws and the agreement he had made with their ancestors . And they refused to listen to his warnings . They worshiped useless idols and became useless themselves . They did what the nations around them did , which the Lord had warned them not to do .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	16	The people rejected all the commands of the Lord their God . They molded statues of two calves , and they made an Asherah idol . They worshiped all the stars of the sky and served Baal .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	18	Because he was very angry with the people of Israel , he removed them from his presence . Only the tribe of Judah was left . Judah Is Also Guilty
NCV	2%20Kings	17	19	But even Judah did not obey the commands of the Lord their God . They did what the Israelites had done ,
NCV	2%20Kings	17	20	so the Lord rejected all the people of Israel . He punished them and let others destroy them ; he threw them out of his presence .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	21	When the Lord separated them from the family of David , the Israelites made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king . Jeroboam led the Israelites away from the Lord and led them to sin greatly .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	22	So they continued to do all the sins Jeroboam did . They did not stop doing these sins
NCV	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord removed the Israelites from his presence , just as he had said through all his servants the prophets . So the Israelites were taken out of their land to Assyria , and they have been there to this day . The Beginning of the Samaritan People
NCV	2%20Kings	17	24	The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim and put them in the cities of Samaria to replace the Israelites . These people took over Samaria and lived in the cities .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	25	At first they did not worship the Lord , so he sent lions among them which killed some of them .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	26	The king of Assyria was told , “ You sent foreigners into the cities of Samaria who do not know the law of the god of the land . This is why he has sent lions among them . The lions are killing them because they don ’ t know what the god wants. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria commanded , “ Send back one of the priests you took away . Let him live there and teach the people what the god wants. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	17	28	So one of the priests who had been carried away from Samaria returned to live in Bethel . And he taught the people how to honor the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	29	But each nation made gods of its own and put them in the cities where they lived and in the temples where gods were worshiped . These temples had been built by the Samaritans .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	30	The people from Babylon made Succoth Benoth their god . The people from Cuthah worshiped Nergal . The people of Hamath worshiped Ashima .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	31	The Avvites worshiped Nibhaz and Tartak . The Sepharvites burned their children in the fire , sacrificing them to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	32	They also honored the Lord , but they chose priests for the places where gods were worshiped . The priests were chosen from among themselves , and they made sacrifices for the people .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	33	The people honored the Lord but also served their own gods , just as the nations did from which they had been brought .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	34	Even today they do as they did in the past . They do not worship the Lord nor obey his rules and commands . They do not obey the teachings or the commands of the Lord , which he gave to the children of Jacob , whom he had named Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	35	The Lord had made an agreement with them and had commanded them , “ Do not honor other gods . Do not bow down to them or worship them or offer sacrifices to them .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	36	Worship the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and strength . Bow down to him and offer sacrifices to him .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	37	Always obey the rules , orders , teachings , and commands he wrote for you . Do not honor other gods .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	38	Do not forget the agreement I made with you , and do not honor other gods .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	39	Instead worship the Lord your God , who will save you from all your enemies. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	17	40	But the Israelites did not listen . They kept on doing the same things they had done before .
NCV	2%20Kings	17	41	So these nations honored the Lord but also worshiped their idols , and their children and grandchildren still do as their ancestors did . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Kings	18	2	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he ruled twenty-nine years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	18	They called for the king , so the king sent Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah out to meet them . Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager , Shebna was the royal secretary , and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	3	Hezekiah did what the Lord said was right , just as his ancestor David had done .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	4	He removed the places where gods were worshiped . He smashed the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah idols . Also the Israelites had been burning incense to Nehushtan , the bronze snake Moses had made . But Hezekiah broke it into pieces .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	5	Hezekiah trusted in the Lord , the God of Israel . There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah , either before him or after him .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	6	Hezekiah was loyal to the Lord and did not stop following him ; he obeyed the commands the Lord had given Moses .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	7	And the Lord was with Hezekiah , so he had success in everything he did . He turned against the king of Assyria and stopped serving him .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	8	Hezekiah defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its borders , including the watchtowers and the strong , walled cities . The Assyrians Capture Samaria
NCV	2%20Kings	18	9	Shalmaneser king of Assyria surrounded Samaria and attacked it in the fourth year Hezekiah was king . This was the seventh year Hoshea son of Elah was king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	10	After three years the Assyrians captured Samaria . This was in the sixth year Hezekiah was king , which was Hoshea ’ s ninth year as king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	11	The king of Assyria took the Israelites away to Assyria and settled them in Halah , in Gozan on the Habor River , and in the cities of the Medes .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	12	This happened because they did not obey the Lord their God . They broke his agreement and did not obey all that Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , had commanded . They would not listen to the commands or do them . Assyria Attacks Judah
NCV	2%20Kings	18	13	During Hezekiah ’ s fourteenth year as king , Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the strong , walled cities of Judah and captured them .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	14	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish . He said , “ I have done wrong . Leave me alone , and I will pay anything you ask. ” So the king of Assyria made Hezekiah pay about twenty-two thousand pounds of silver and two thousand pounds of gold .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	15	Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was in the Temple of the Lord and in the palace treasuries .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	16	Hezekiah stripped all the gold that covered the doors and doorposts of the Temple of the Lord . Hezekiah had put gold on these doors himself , but he gave it all to the king of Assyria .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	17	The king of Assyria sent out his supreme commander , his chief officer , and his field commander . They went with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem . When they came near the waterway from the upper pool on the road where people do their laundry , they stopped .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	19	The field commander said to them , “ Tell Hezekiah this : “ ‘ The great king , the king of Assyria , says : What can you trust in now ?
NCV	2%20Kings	18	20	You say you have battle plans and power for war , but your words mean nothing . Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me ?
NCV	2%20Kings	18	21	Look , you are depending on Egypt to help you , but Egypt is like a splintered walking stick . If you lean on it for help , it will stab your hand and hurt you . The king of Egypt will hurt all those who depend on him .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	22	You might say , “ We are depending on the Lord our God , ” but Hezekiah destroyed the Lord ’ s altars and the places of worship . Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem , “ You must worship only at this one altar in Jerusalem. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	18	23	“ ‘ Now make an agreement with my master , the king of Assyria : I will give you two thousand horses if you can find enough men to ride them .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	24	You can not defeat one of my master ’ s least important officers , so why do you depend on Egypt to give you chariots and horsemen ?
NCV	2%20Kings	18	25	I have not come to attack and destroy this place without an order from the Lord . The Lord himself told me to come to this country and destroy it. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	18	26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah , Shebna , and Joah said to the field commander , “ Please speak to us in the Aramaic language . We understand it . Don ’ t speak to us in Hebrew , because the people on the city wall can hear you. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	18	27	“ No , ” the commander said , “ my master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king . He sent me to speak also to those people sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	18	28	Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language , “ Listen to what the great king , the king of Assyria , says !
NCV	2%20Kings	18	29	The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you , because he can ’ t save you from my power .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	30	Don ’ t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting the Lord by saying , ‘ The Lord will surely save us . This city won ’ t be handed over to the king of Assyria. ’
NCV	2%20Kings	18	31	“ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah . The king of Assyria says , ‘ Make peace with me , and come out of the city to me . Then everyone will be free to eat the fruit from his own grapevine and fig tree and to drink water from his own well .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	32	After that I will come and take you to a land like your own—a land with grain and new wine , bread and vineyards , olives , and honey . Choose to live and not to die ! ’ “ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah . He is fooling you when he says , ‘ The Lord will save us. ’
NCV	2%20Kings	18	33	Has a god of any other nation saved his people from the power of the king of Assyria ?
NCV	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? They did not save Samaria from my power .
NCV	2%20Kings	18	35	Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me . Neither can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	18	36	The people were silent . They didn ’ t answer the commander at all , because King Hezekiah had ordered , “ Don ’ t answer him. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	18	37	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah tore their clothes to show how upset they were . ( Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager , Shebna was the royal secretary , and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder . ) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said .

NCV	2%20Kings	19	2	Hezekiah sent Eliakim , the palace manager , and Shebna , the royal secretary , and the older priests to Isaiah . They were all wearing rough cloth when they came to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	19	Now , Lord our God , save us from the king ’ s power so that all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you , Lord , are the only God. ” God Answers Hezekiah
NCV	2%20Kings	19	3	They told Isaiah , “ This is what Hezekiah says : Today is a day of sorrow and punishment and disgrace , as when a child should be born , but the mother is not strong enough to give birth to it .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	4	The king of Assyria sent his field commander to make fun of the living God . Maybe the Lord your God will hear what the commander said and will punish him for it . So pray for the few of us who are left alive. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	19	5	When Hezekiah ’ s officers came to Isaiah ,
NCV	2%20Kings	19	6	he said to them , “ Tell your master this : The Lord says , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of what you have heard . Don ’ t be frightened by the words the servants of the king of Assyria have spoken against me .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	7	Listen ! I am going to put a spirit in the king of Assyria . He will hear a report that will make him return to his own country , and I will cause him to die by the sword there. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	19	8	The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish . When he went back , he found the king fighting against the city of Libnah .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	9	The king received a report that Tirhakah , the Cushite king of Egypt , was coming to attack him . When the king of Assyria heard this , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
NCV	2%20Kings	19	10	“ Tell Hezekiah king of Judah : Don ’ t be fooled by the god you trust . Don ’ t believe him when he says Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	11	You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done . They have completely defeated every country , so do not think you will be saved .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	12	Did the gods of those people save them ? My ancestors destroyed them , defeating the cities of Gozan , Haran , and Rezeph , and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	13	Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the kings of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? ” Hezekiah Prays to the Lord
NCV	2%20Kings	19	14	When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it , he went up to the Temple of the Lord . He spread the letter out before the Lord
NCV	2%20Kings	19	15	and prayed to the Lord : “ Lord , God of Israel , whose throne is between the gold creatures with wings , only you are God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You made the heavens and the earth .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	16	Hear , Lord , and listen . Open your eyes , Lord , and see . Listen to the words Sennacherib has said to insult the living God .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	17	It is true , Lord , that the kings of Assyria have destroyed these countries and their lands .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	18	They have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire , but they were only wood and rock statues that people made . So the kings have destroyed them .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah that said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I have heard your prayer to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	21	This is what the Lord has said against Sennacherib : ‘ The people of Jerusalem hate you and make fun of you . The people of Jerusalem laugh at you as you run away .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	22	You have insulted me and spoken against me ; you have raised your voice against me . You have a proud look on your face , which is against me , the Holy One of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	23	You have sent your messengers to insult the Lord . You have said , “ With my many chariots I have gone to the tops of the mountains , to the highest mountains of Lebanon . I have cut down its tallest cedars and its best pine trees . I have gone to its farthest places and to its best forests .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	24	I have dug wells in foreign countries and drunk water there . By the soles of my feet , I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	19	25	“ ‘ King of Assyria , surely you have heard . Long ago I , the Lord , planned these things . Long ago I designed them , and now I have made them happen . I allowed you to turn those strong , walled cities into piles of rocks .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	26	The people in those cities were weak ; they were frightened and put to shame . They were like grass in the field , like tender , young grass , like grass on the housetop that is burned by the wind before it can grow .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	27	“ ‘ I know when you rest , when you come and go , and how you rage against me .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	28	Because you rage against me , and because I have heard your proud words , I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth . Then I will force you to leave my country the same way you came. ’
NCV	2%20Kings	19	29	“ Then the Lord said , ‘ Hezekiah , I will give you this sign : This year you will eat the grain that grows wild , and the second year you will eat what grows wild from that . But in the third year , plant grain and harvest it . Plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	30	Some of the people in the family of Judah will escape . Like plants that take root , they will grow strong and have many children .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	31	A few people will come out of Jerusalem alive ; a few from Mount Zion will live . The strong love of the Lord All-Powerful will make this happen. ’
NCV	2%20Kings	19	32	“ So this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria : ‘ He will not enter this city or even shoot an arrow here . He will not fight against it with shields or build a ramp to attack the city walls .

NCV	2%20Kings	19	34	‘ I will defend and save this city for my sake and for the sake of David , my servant. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	19	35	That night the angel of the Lord went out and killed one hundred eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp . When the people got up early the next morning , they saw all the dead bodies .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria left and went back to Nineveh and stayed there .
NCV	2%20Kings	19	37	One day as Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword . Then they escaped to the land of Ararat .

NCV	2%20Kings	20	2	Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed to the Lord ,
NCV	2%20Kings	20	20	Everything else Hezekiah did—all his victories , his work on the pool , his work on the tunnel to bring water into the city—is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	3	“ Lord , please remember that I have always obeyed you . I have given myself completely to you and have done what you said was right. ” Then Hezekiah cried loudly .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	4	Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard , the Lord spoke his word to Isaiah :
NCV	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Go back and tell Hezekiah , the leader of my people : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : I have heard your prayer and seen your tears , so I will heal you . Three days from now you will go up to the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	6	I will add fifteen years to your life . I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria ; I will protect the city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	7	Then Isaiah said , “ Make a paste from figs. ” So they made it and put it on Hezekiah ’ s boil , and he got well .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	8	Hezekiah had asked Isaiah , “ What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me and that I will go up to the Temple of the Lord on the third day ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	9	Isaiah said , “ The Lord will do what he says . This is the sign from the Lord to show you : Do you want the shadow to go forward ten steps or back ten steps ? ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	10	Hezekiah answered , “ It ’ s easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps . Instead , let it go back ten steps. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	11	Then Isaiah the prophet called to the Lord , and the Lord brought the shadow ten steps back up the stairway of Ahaz that it had gone down . Messengers from Babylon
NCV	2%20Kings	20	12	At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon . He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah , because he had heard that Hezekiah was sick .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	13	Hezekiah listened to the messengers , so he showed them what was in his storehouses : the silver , gold , spices , expensive perfumes , his swords and shields , and all his wealth . He showed them everything in his palace and his kingdom .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him , “ What did these men say ? Where did they come from ? ” Hezekiah said , “ They came from a faraway country—from Babylon. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	15	So Isaiah asked him , “ What did they see in your palace ? ” Hezekiah said , “ They saw everything in my palace . I showed them all my wealth. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to the words of the Lord :
NCV	2%20Kings	20	17	‘ In the future everything in your palace and everything your ancestors have stored up until this day will be taken away to Babylon . Nothing will be left , ’ says the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	20	18	‘ Some of your own children , those who will be born to you , will be taken away . And they will become servants in the palace of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	20	19	Hezekiah told Isaiah , “ These words from the Lord are good. ” He said this because he thought , “ There will be peace and security in my lifetime. ”

NCV	2%20Kings	21	2	He did what the Lord said was wrong . He did the hateful things the other nations had done—the nations that the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	21	He lived in the same way his father had lived : he worshiped the idols his father had worshiped , and he bowed down before them .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	3	Manasseh ’ s father , Hezekiah , had destroyed the places where gods were worshiped , but Manasseh rebuilt them . He built altars for Baal , and he made an Asherah idol as Ahab king of Israel had done . Manasseh also worshiped all the stars of the sky and served them .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	4	The Lord had said about the Temple , “ I will be worshiped in Jerusalem , ” but Manasseh built altars in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	5	He built altars to worship the stars in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	6	He made his own son pass through fire . He practiced magic and told the future by explaining signs and dreams , and he got advice from mediums and fortune-tellers . He did many things the Lord said were wrong , which made the Lord angry .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	7	Manasseh carved an Asherah idol and put it in the Temple . The Lord had said to David and his son Solomon about the Temple , “ I will be worshiped forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	8	I will never again make the Israelites wander out of the land I gave their ancestors . But they must obey everything I have commanded them and all the teachings my servant Moses gave them. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	21	9	But the people did not listen . Manasseh led them to do more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed ahead of the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	10	The Lord said through his servants the prophets ,
NCV	2%20Kings	21	11	“ Manasseh king of Judah has done these hateful things . He has done more evil than the Amorites before him . He also has led Judah to sin with his idols .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	12	So this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I will bring so much trouble on Jerusalem and Judah that anyone who hears about it will be shocked .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	13	I will stretch the measuring line of Samaria over Jerusalem , and the plumb line used against Ahab ’ s family will be used on Jerusalem . I will wipe out Jerusalem as a person wipes a dish and turns it upside down .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	14	I will throw away the rest of my people who are left . I will give them to their enemies , and they will be robbed by all their enemies ,
NCV	2%20Kings	21	15	because my people did what I said was wrong . They have made me angry from the day their ancestors left Egypt until now. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	21	16	Manasseh also killed many innocent people , filling Jerusalem from one end to the other with their blood . This was besides the sin he led Judah to do ; he led Judah to do what the Lord said was wrong .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	17	The other things Manasseh did as king , even the sin he did , are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	18	Manasseh died and was buried in the garden of his own palace , the garden of Uzza . Then Manasseh ’ s son Amon became king in his place . Amon King of Judah
NCV	2%20Kings	21	19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king , and he was king for two years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz , who was from Jotbah .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	20	Amon did what the Lord said was wrong , as his father Manasseh had done .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	22	Amon rejected the Lord , the God of his ancestors , and did not follow the ways of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	23	Amon ’ s officers made plans against him and killed him in his palace .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	24	Then the people of the land killed all those who had made plans to kill King Amon , and they made his son Josiah king in his place .
NCV	2%20Kings	21	25	Everything else Amon did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .

NCV	2%20Kings	22	2	Josiah did what the Lord said was right . He lived as his ancestor David had lived , and he did not stop doing what was right .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	22	Josiah was eight years old when he became king , and he ruled thirty-one years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah , who was from Bozkath .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	3	In Josiah ’ s eighteenth year as king , he sent Shaphan to the Temple of the Lord . Shaphan son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , was the royal secretary . Josiah said ,
NCV	2%20Kings	22	4	“ Go up to Hilkiah the high priest , and have him empty out the money the gatekeepers have gathered from the people . This is the money they have brought into the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	5	Have him give the money to the supervisors of the work on the Temple of the Lord . They must pay the workers who repair the Temple of the Lord—
NCV	2%20Kings	22	6	the carpenters , builders , and bricklayers . Also use the money to buy timber and cut stone to repair the Temple .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	7	They do not need to report how they use the money given to them , because they are working honestly. ” The Book of the Teachings Is Found
NCV	2%20Kings	22	8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the royal secretary , “ I ’ ve found the Book of the Teachings in the Temple of the Lord. ” He gave it to Shaphan , who read it .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	9	Then Shaphan the royal secretary went to the king and reported to Josiah , “ Your officers have paid out the money that was in the Temple of the Lord . They have given it to the workers and supervisors at the Temple. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	22	10	Then Shaphan the royal secretary told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ” And Shaphan read from the book to the king .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	11	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Teachings , he tore his clothes to show how upset he was .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	12	He gave orders to Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Acbor son of Micaiah , Shaphan the royal secretary , and Asaiah the king ’ s servant . These were the orders :
NCV	2%20Kings	22	13	“ Go and ask the Lord about the words in the book that was found . Ask for me , for all the people , and for all Judah . The Lord ’ s anger is burning against us , because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book ; they did not do all the things written for us to do. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	22	14	So Hilkiah the priest , Ahikam , Acbor , Shaphan , and Asaiah went to talk to Huldah the prophetess . She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , who took care of the king ’ s clothes . Huldah lived in Jerusalem , in the new area of the city .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	15	She said to them , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Tell the man who sent you to me ,
NCV	2%20Kings	22	16	‘ This is what the Lord says : I will bring trouble to this place and to the people living here , as it is written in the book which the king of Judah has read .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	17	The people of Judah have left me and have burned incense to other gods . They have made me angry by all that they have done . My anger burns against this place like a fire , and it will not be put out. ’
NCV	2%20Kings	22	18	Tell the king of Judah , who sent you to ask the Lord , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says about the words you heard :
NCV	2%20Kings	22	19	When you heard my words against this place and its people , you became sorry for what you had done and humbled yourself before me . I said they would be cursed and would be destroyed . You tore your clothes to show how upset you were , and you cried in my presence . This is why I have heard you , says the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	22	20	So I will let you die , and you will be buried in peace . You won ’ t see all the trouble I will bring to this place. ’ ” So they took her message back to the king . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Kings	23	2	He went up to the Temple of the Lord , and all the people from Judah and Jerusalem went with him . The priests , prophets , and all the people—from the least important to the most important—went with him . He read to them all the words of the Book of the Agreement that was found in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	23	This Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem in the eighteenth year of King Josiah ’ s rule .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	3	The king stood by the pillar and made an agreement in the presence of the Lord to follow the Lord and obey his commands , rules , and laws with his whole being , and to obey the words of the agreement written in this book . Then all the people promised to obey the agreement . Josiah Destroys the Places for Idol Worship
NCV	2%20Kings	23	4	The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the next rank and the gatekeepers to bring out of the Temple of the Lord everything made for Baal , Asherah , and all the stars of the sky . Then Josiah burned them outside Jerusalem in the open country of the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	5	The kings of Judah had chosen priests for these gods . These priests burned incense in the places where gods were worshiped in the cities of Judah and the towns around Jerusalem . They burned incense to Baal , the sun , the moon , the planets , and all the stars of the sky . But Josiah took those priests away .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	6	He removed the Asherah idol from the Temple of the Lord and took it outside Jerusalem to the Kidron Valley , where he burned it and beat it into dust . Then he threw the dust on the graves of the common people .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	7	He also tore down the houses of the male prostitutes who were in the Temple of the Lord , where the women did weaving for Asherah .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	8	King Josiah brought all the false priests from the cities of Judah . He ruined the places where gods were worshiped , where the priests had burned incense , from Geba to Beersheba . He destroyed the places of worship at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua , the ruler of the city , on the left side of the city gate .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	9	The priests at the places where gods were worshiped were not allowed to serve at the Lord ’ s altar in Jerusalem . But they could eat bread made without yeast with their brothers .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	10	Josiah ruined Topheth , in the Valley of Ben Hinnom , so no one could sacrifice his son or daughter to Molech .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	11	Judah ’ s kings had placed horses at the front door of the Temple of the Lord in the courtyard near the room of Nathan-Melech , an officer . These horses were for the worship of the sun . So Josiah removed them and burned the chariots that were for sun worship also .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	12	The kings of Judah had built altars on the roof [ a ] of the upstairs room of Ahaz . Josiah broke down these altars and the altars Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the Temple of the Lord . Josiah smashed them to pieces and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	13	King Josiah ruined the places where gods were worshiped east of Jerusalem , south of the Mount of Olives . [ b ] Solomon king of Israel had built these places . One was for Ashtoreth , the hated goddess of the Sidonians . One was for Chemosh , the hated god of Moab . And one was for Molech , the hated god of the Ammonites .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	14	Josiah smashed to pieces the stone pillars they worshiped , and he cut down the Asherah idols . Then he covered the places with human bones .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	15	Josiah also broke down the altar at Bethel—the place of worship made by Jeroboam son of Nebat , who had led Israel to sin . Josiah burned that place , broke the stones of the altar into pieces , then beat them into dust . He also burned the Asherah idol .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	16	When he turned around , he saw the graves on the mountain . He had the bones taken from the graves , and he burned them on the altar to ruin it . This happened as the Lord had said it would through the man of God .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	17	Josiah asked , “ What is that monument I see ? ” The people of the city answered , “ It ’ s the grave of the man of God who came from Judah . This prophet announced the things you have done against the altar of Bethel. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	23	18	Josiah said , “ Leave the grave alone . No one may move this man ’ s bones. ” So they left his bones and the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	19	The kings of Israel had built temples for worshiping gods in the cities of Samaria , which had caused the Lord to be angry . Josiah removed all those temples and did the same things as he had done at Bethel .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	20	He killed all the priests of those places of worship ; he killed them on the altars and burned human bones on the altars . Then he went back to Jerusalem . Josiah Celebrates the Passover
NCV	2%20Kings	23	21	The king commanded all the people , “ Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God as it is written in this Book of the Agreement. ”
NCV	2%20Kings	23	22	The Passover had not been celebrated like this since the judges led Israel . Nor had one like it happened while there were kings of Israel and kings of Judah .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	24	Josiah destroyed the mediums , fortune-tellers , house gods , and idols . He also destroyed all the hated gods seen in the land of Judah and Jerusalem . This was to obey the words of the teachings written in the book Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	25	There was no king like Josiah before or after him . He obeyed the Lord with all his heart , soul , and strength , following all the Teachings of Moses .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	26	Even so , the Lord did not stop his strong and terrible anger . His anger burned against Judah because of all Manasseh had done to make him angry .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	27	The Lord said , “ I will send Judah out of my sight , as I have sent Israel away . I will reject Jerusalem , which I chose . And I will take away the Temple about which I said , ‘ I will be worshiped there. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Kings	23	28	Everything else Josiah did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	29	While Josiah was king , Neco king of Egypt went to help the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River . King Josiah marched out to fight against Neco , but at Megiddo , Neco faced him and killed him .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	30	Josiah ’ s servants carried his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own grave . Then the people of Judah chose Josiah ’ s son Jehoahaz and poured olive oil on him to make him king in his father ’ s place . Jehoahaz King of Judah
NCV	2%20Kings	23	31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king , and he was king in Jerusalem for three months . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal , who was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	32	Jehoahaz did what the Lord said was wrong , just as his ancestors had done .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	33	King Neco took Jehoahaz prisoner at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that Jehoahaz could not rule in Jerusalem . Neco made the people of Judah pay about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver and about seventy-five pounds of gold .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	34	King Neco made Josiah ’ s son Eliakim the king in place of Josiah his father . Then Neco changed Eliakim ’ s name to Jehoiakim . But Neco took Jehoahaz to Egypt , where he died .
NCV	2%20Kings	23	35	Jehoiakim gave King Neco the silver and gold he demanded . Jehoiakim taxed the land and took silver and gold from the people of the land to give to King Neco . Each person had to pay his share . Jehoiakim King of Judah

NCV	2%20Kings	24	2	The Lord sent raiding parties from Babylon , Aram , Moab , and Ammon against Jehoiakim to destroy Judah . This happened as the Lord had said it would through his servants the prophets .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	24	While Jehoiakim was king , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked the land of Judah . So Jehoiakim became Nebuchadnezzar ’ s servant for three years . Then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and broke away from his rule .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	3	The Lord commanded this to happen to the people of Judah , to remove them from his presence , because of all the sins of Manasseh .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	4	He had killed many innocent people and had filled Jerusalem with their blood . And the Lord would not forgive these sins .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	5	The other things that happened while Jehoiakim was king and all he did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah .

NCV	2%20Kings	24	9	Jehoiachin did what the Lord said was wrong , just as his father had done .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	10	At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem . When they reached the city , they attacked it .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	11	Nebuchadnezzar himself came to the city while his officers were attacking it .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	12	Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon , along with Jehoiachin ’ s mother , servants , nobles , and officers . So Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin a prisoner in the eighth year he was king of Babylon .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	13	Nebuchadnezzar took all the treasures from the Temple of the Lord and from the palace . He cut up all the gold objects Solomon king of Israel had made for the Temple of the Lord . This happened as the Lord had said it would .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	14	Nebuchadnezzar took away all the people of Jerusalem , including all the leaders , all the wealthy people , and all the craftsmen and metal workers . There were ten thousand prisoners in all . Only the poorest people in the land were left .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	15	Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , as well as the king ’ s mother and his wives , the officers , and the leading men of the land . They were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon .
NCV	2%20Kings	24	16	The king of Babylon also took all seven thousand soldiers , who were strong and able to fight in war , and about a thousand craftsmen and metal workers . Nebuchadnezzar took them as prisoners to Babylon .

NCV	2%20Kings	25	3	By the ninth day of the fourth month , the hunger was terrible in the city . There was no food for the people to eat .
NCV	2%20Kings	25	4	Then the city was broken into , and the whole army ran away at night through the gate between the two walls by the king ’ s garden . While the Babylonians were still surrounding the city , Zedekiah and his men ran away toward the Jordan Valley .
NCV	2%20Kings	25	5	But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah and caught up with him in the plains of Jericho . All of his army was scattered from him ,

NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	16	David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord in the sky , holding his sword drawn and pointed at Jerusalem . Then David and the elders bowed facedown on the ground . They were wearing rough cloth to show their grief .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	17	David said to God , “ I am the one who sinned and did wrong . I gave the order for the people to be counted . These people only followed me like sheep . They did nothing wrong . Lord my God , please punish me and my family , but stop the terrible disease that is killing your people. ”
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Then the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David that he should build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	19	So David did what Gad told him to do , in the name of the Lord .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Araunah was separating the wheat from the straw . When he turned around , he saw the angel . Araunah ’ s four sons who were with him hid .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	22	David said to him , “ Sell me your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the Lord here . Then the terrible disease will stop . Sell it to me for the full price. ”
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Araunah said to David , “ Take this threshing floor . My master the king , do anything you want . Look , I will also give you oxen for the whole burnt offerings , the threshing boards for the wood , and wheat for the grain offering . I give everything to you. ”
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But King David answered Araunah , “ No , I will pay the full price for the land . I won ’ t take anything that is yours and give it to the Lord . I won ’ t offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing. ”
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David paid Araunah about fifteen pounds of gold for the place .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	26	David built an altar to the Lord there and offered whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . David prayed to the Lord , and he answered him by sending down fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	27	Then the Lord commanded the angel to put his sword back into its holder .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	28	When David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah , he offered sacrifices there .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	29	The Holy Tent that Moses made while the Israelites were in the desert and the altar of burnt offerings were in Gibeon at the place of worship .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	21	30	But David could not go to the Holy Tent to speak with God , because he was afraid of the angel of the Lord and his sword .

NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	2	So David ordered all foreigners living in Israel to gather together . From that group David chose stonecutters to cut stones to be used in building the Temple of God .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	3	David supplied a large amount of iron to be used for making nails and hinges for the gate doors . He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed ,
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	4	and he supplied more cedar logs than could be counted . Much of the cedar had been brought to David by the people from Sidon and Tyre .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	5	David said , “ We should build a great Temple for the Lord , which will be famous everywhere for its greatness and beauty . But my son Solomon is young . He hasn ’ t yet learned what he needs to know , so I will prepare for the building of it. ” So David got many of the materials ready before he died .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	6	Then David called for his son Solomon and told him to build the Temple for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	7	David said to him , “ My son , I wanted to build a temple for worshiping the Lord my God .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But the Lord spoke his word to me , ‘ David , you have killed many people . You have fought many wars . You can not build a temple for worship to me , because you have killed many people .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	9	But , you will have a son , a man of peace and rest . I will give him rest from all his enemies around him . His name will be Solomon , [ a ] and I will give Israel peace and quiet while he is king .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	10	Solomon will build a temple for worship to me . He will be my son , and I will be his father . I will make his kingdom strong ; someone from his family will rule Israel forever. ’ ”
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	11	David said , “ Now , my son , may the Lord be with you . May you build a temple for the Lord your God , as he said you would .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	12	He will make you the king of Israel . May the Lord give you wisdom and understanding so you will be able to obey the teachings of the Lord your God .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	13	Be careful to obey the rules and laws the Lord gave Moses for Israel . If you obey them , you will have success . Be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid or discouraged .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	14	“ Solomon , I have worked hard getting many of the materials for building the Temple of the Lord . I have supplied about seven and one-half million pounds of gold , about seventy-five million pounds of silver , so much bronze and iron it can not be weighed , and wood and stone . You may add to them .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	15	You have many workmen—stonecutters , bricklayers , carpenters , and people skilled in every kind of work .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	16	They are skilled in working with gold , silver , bronze , and iron . You have more craftsmen than can be counted . Now begin the work , and may the Lord be with you. ”
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	18	David said to them , “ The Lord your God is with you . He has given you rest from our enemies . He has handed over to me the people living around us . The Lord and his people are in control of this land .
NCV	1%20Chronicles	22	19	Now give yourselves completely to obeying the Lord your God . Build the holy place of the Lord God ; build the Temple for worship to the Lord . Then bring the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord and the holy items that belong to God into the Temple. ” Footnotes - 22:9 Solomon This name sounds like the Hebrew word for “ peace. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	2	Solomon called for the elders of Israel , the heads of the tribes , and the leaders of the families to come to him in Jerusalem . He wanted them to bring the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord from the older part of the city .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	5	They carried the Ark of the Agreement , the Meeting Tent , and the holy utensils in it ; the priests and the Levites brought them up .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	3	So all the Israelites came together with the king during the festival in the seventh month .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	4	When all the elders of Israel arrived , the Levites lifted up the Ark .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	6	King Solomon and all the Israelites gathered before the Ark of the Agreement and sacrificed so many sheep and bulls no one could count them .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	7	Then the priests put the Ark of the Agreement with the Lord in its place inside the Most Holy Place in the Temple , under the wings of the golden creatures .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	8	The wings of these creatures were spread out over the place for the Ark , covering it and its carrying poles .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	9	The carrying poles were so long that anyone standing in the Holy Place in front of the Most Holy Place could see the ends of the poles . But no one could see them from outside the Holy Place . The poles are still there today .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	10	The only things inside the Ark were two stone tablets [ a ] that Moses had put in the Ark at Mount Sinai . That was where the Lord made his agreement with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	11	Then all the priests left the Holy Place . ( All the priests from each group had made themselves ready to serve the Lord . )
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	12	All the Levite musicians—Asaph , Heman , Jeduthun , and all their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar . They were dressed in white linen and played cymbals , harps , and lyres . With them were one hundred twenty priests who blew trumpets .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	13	Those who blew the trumpets and those who sang together sounded like one person as they praised and thanked the Lord . They sang as others played their trumpets , cymbals , and other instruments . They praised the Lord with this song : “ He is good ; his love continues forever. ” Then the Temple of the Lord was filled with a cloud .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	5	14	The priests could not continue their work because of the cloud , because the Lord ’ s glory filled the Temple of God . Footnotes - 5:10 stone tablets They were the two stone tablets on which God wrote the Ten Commandments . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	2	Lord , I have built a wonderful Temple for you—a place for you to live forever. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place I am to be worshiped , and I have chosen David to lead my people Israel. ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	3	While all the Israelites were standing there , King Solomon turned to them and blessed them .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	4	Then he said , “ Praise the Lord , the God of Israel . He has done what he promised to my father David . The Lord said ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	5	‘ Since the time I brought my people out of Egypt , I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel where a temple will be built for me . I did not choose a man to lead my people Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	7	“ My father David wanted to build a temple for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	8	But the Lord said to my father David , ‘ It was good that you wanted to build a temple for me .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	9	But you are not the one to build it . Your son , who comes from your own body , is the one who will build my temple. ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	10	“ Now the Lord has kept his promise . I am the king now in place of David my father . Now I rule Israel as the Lord promised , and I have built the Temple for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	11	There I have put the Ark , in which is the Agreement the Lord made with the Israelites. ” Solomon ’ s Prayer
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	12	Then Solomon stood facing the Lord ’ s altar , and all the Israelites were standing behind him . He spread out his hands .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	13	He had made a bronze platform seven and one-half feet long , seven and one-half feet wide , and seven and one-half feet high , and he had placed it in the middle of the outer courtyard . Solomon stood on the platform . Then he kneeled in front of all the people of Israel gathered there , and he spread out his hands toward the sky .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	14	He said , “ Lord , God of Israel , there is no god like you in heaven or on earth . You keep your agreement of love with your servants who truly follow you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	15	You have kept the promise you made to your servant David , my father . You spoke it with your own mouth and finished it with your hands today .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	16	“ Now , Lord , God of Israel , keep the promise you made to your servant David , my father . You said , ‘ If your sons are careful to obey my teachings as you have obeyed , there will always be someone from your family ruling Israel. ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	17	Now , Lord , God of Israel , please continue to keep that promise you made to your servant .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	18	“ But , God , can you really live here on the earth with people ? The sky and the highest place in heaven can not contain you . Surely this house which I have built can not contain you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	19	But please listen to my prayer and my request , because I am your servant . Lord my God , hear this prayer your servant prays to you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	20	Day and night please watch over this Temple where you have said you would be worshiped . Hear the prayer I pray facing this Temple .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	21	Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when we pray facing this place . Hear from your home in heaven , and when you hear , forgive us .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	22	“ If someone wrongs another person , he will be brought to the altar in this Temple . If he swears an oath that he is not guilty ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	23	then hear in heaven . Judge the case , punish the guilty , but declare that the innocent person is not guilty .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	24	“ When your people , the Israelites , sin against you , their enemies will defeat them . But if they come back to you and praise you and pray to you in this Temple ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	25	then listen from heaven . Forgive the sin of your people Israel , and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	26	“ When they sin against you , you will stop the rain from falling on their land . Then they will pray , facing this place and praising you ; they will stop sinning when you make them suffer .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	27	When this happens , hear their prayer in heaven , and forgive the sins of your servants , the Israelites . Teach them to do what is right . Then please send rain to this land you have given particularly to them .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	28	“ At times the land will get so dry that no food will grow , or a great sickness will spread among the people . Sometimes the crops will be destroyed by locusts or grasshoppers . Your people will be attacked in their cities by their enemies , or will become sick .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	29	When any of these things happens , the people will become truly sorry . If your people spread their hands in prayer toward this Temple ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	30	then hear their prayers from your home in heaven . Forgive and treat each person as he should be treated because you know what is in a person ’ s heart . Only you know what is in people ’ s hearts .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	31	Then the people will respect and obey you as long as they live in this land you gave our ancestors .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	32	“ People who are not Israelites , foreigners from other lands , will hear about your greatness and power . They will come from far away to pray at this Temple .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	33	Then hear from your home in heaven , and do whatever they ask you . Then people everywhere will know you and respect you , just as your people Israel do . Then everyone will know that I built this Temple as a place to worship you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	34	“ When your people go out to fight their enemies along some road on which you send them , your people will pray to you , facing this city which you have chosen and the Temple I have built for you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	35	Then hear in heaven their prayers , and do what is right .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	36	“ Everyone sins , so your people will also sin against you . You will become angry with them and will hand them over to their enemies . Their enemies will capture them and take them away to a country far or near .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	37	Your people will be sorry for their sins when they are held as prisoners in another country . They will be sorry and pray to you in the land where they are held as prisoners , saying , ‘ We have sinned . We have done wrong and acted wickedly. ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	38	They will truly turn back to you in the land where they are captives . They will pray , facing this land you gave their ancestors , this city you have chosen , and the Temple I have built for you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	39	Then hear their prayers from your home in heaven and do what is right . Forgive your people who have sinned against you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	40	“ Now , my God , look at us . Listen to the prayers we pray in this place .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	6	41	Now , rise , Lord God , and come to your resting place . Come with the Ark of the Agreement that shows your strength . Let your priests receive your salvation , Lord God , and may your holy people be happy because of your goodness .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	2	The priests could not enter the Temple of the Lord , because the Lord ’ s glory filled it .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	7	Solomon made holy the middle part of the courtyard , which is in front of the Temple of the Lord . There he offered whole burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings . He offered them in the courtyard , because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and fat .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	3	When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down from heaven and the Lord ’ s glory on the Temple , they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground . They worshiped and thanked the Lord , saying , “ He is good ; his love continues forever. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	4	Then King Solomon and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . So the king and all the people gave the Temple to God .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	6	The priests stood ready to do their work . The Levites also stood with the instruments of the Lord ’ s music that King David had made for praising the Lord . The priests and Levites were saying , “ His love continues forever. ” The priests , who stood across from the Levites , blew their trumpets , and all the Israelites were standing .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	8	Solomon and all the Israelites celebrated the festival for seven days . There were many people , and they came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the brook of Egypt .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	9	For seven days they celebrated giving the altar for the worship of God . Then they celebrated the festival for seven days . On the eighth day they had a meeting .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month Solomon sent the people home , full of joy . They were happy because the Lord had been so good to David , Solomon , and his people Israel . The Lord Appears to Solomon
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	11	Solomon finished the Temple of the Lord and his royal palace . He had success in doing everything he planned in the Temple of the Lord and his own palace .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Then the Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him , “ I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself to be a Temple for sacrifices .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	13	“ I may stop the sky from sending rain . I may command the locusts to destroy the land . I may send sicknesses to my people .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	14	Then if my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves , if they will pray and seek me and stop their evil ways , I will hear them from heaven . I will forgive their sin , and I will heal their land .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	15	Now I will see them , and I will listen to the prayers prayed in this place .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	16	I have chosen this Temple and made it holy . So I will be worshiped there forever . Yes , I will always watch over it and love it .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	17	“ But you must serve me as your father David did . You must obey all I have commanded and keep my laws and rules .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	18	If you do , I will make your kingdom strong . This is the agreement I made with your father David , saying , ‘ Someone from your family will always rule in Israel. ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	19	“ But you must follow me and obey the laws and commands I have given you . You must not serve or worship other gods .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	20	If you do , I will take the Israelites out of my land , the land I have given them , and I will leave this Temple that I have made holy . All the nations will make fun of it and speak evil about it .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	21	This Temple is honored now , but then , everyone who passes by will be shocked . They will ask , ‘ Why did the Lord do this terrible thing to this land and this Temple ? ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	7	22	People will answer , ‘ This happened because they left the Lord , the God of their ancestors , the God who brought them out of Egypt . They decided to follow other gods and worshiped and served them , so he brought all this disaster on them. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	2	Solomon rebuilt the towns that Hiram had given him , and Solomon sent Israelites to live in them .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	8	They were descendants of the people that the Israelites had not destroyed . Solomon forced them to be slave workers , as is still true today .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	3	Then he went to Hamath Zobah and captured it .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	4	Solomon also built the town of Tadmor in the desert , and he built all the towns in Hamath as towns for storing grain and supplies .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	5	He rebuilt the towns of Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon , protecting them with strong walls , gates , and bars in the gates .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	6	He also rebuilt the town of Baalath . And he built all the other towns for storage and all the cities for his chariots and horses . He built all he wanted in Jerusalem , Lebanon , and everywhere he ruled .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	7	There were other people in the land who were not Israelites—the Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	9	But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites . They were his soldiers , chief captains , commanders of his chariots , and his chariot drivers .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	10	These were his most important officers . There were two hundred fifty of them to direct the people .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	11	Solomon brought the daughter of the king of Egypt from the older part of Jerusalem to the palace he had built for her . Solomon said , “ My wife must not live in King David ’ s palace , because the places where the Ark of the Agreement has been are holy. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar he had built for the Lord in front of the Temple porch .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	13	He offered sacrifices every day as Moses had commanded . They were offered on the Sabbath days , New Moons , and the three yearly feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Feast of Weeks , and the Feast of Shelters .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	14	Solomon followed his father David ’ s instructions and chose the groups of priests for their service and the Levites to lead the praise and to help the priests do their daily work . And he chose the gatekeepers by their groups to serve at each gate , as David , the man of God , had commanded .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	15	They obeyed all of Solomon ’ s commands to the priests and Levites , as well as his commands about the treasuries .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	16	All Solomon ’ s work was done as he had said from the day the foundation of the Temple of the Lord was begun , until it was finished . So the Temple was finished .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	17	Then Solomon went to the towns of Ezion Geber and Elath near the Red Sea in the land of Edom .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	8	18	Hiram sent ships to Solomon that were commanded by his own men , who were skilled sailors . Hiram ’ s men went with Solomon ’ s men to Ophir and brought back about thirty-four thousand pounds of gold to King Solomon . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	2	and Solomon answered all her questions . Nothing was too hard for him to explain to her .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	9	Then she gave the king about nine thousand pounds of gold and many spices and jewels . No one had ever given such spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	3	The queen of Sheba saw that Solomon was very wise . She saw the palace he had built ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	4	the food on his table , his many officers , the palace servants and their good clothes , the servants who served Solomon his wine and their good clothes . She saw the whole burnt offerings he made in the Temple of the Lord . All these things amazed her .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	5	So she said to King Solomon , “ What I heard in my own country about your achievements and wisdom is true .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	6	I did not believe it then , but now I have come and seen it with my own eyes . I was not told even half of your great wisdom ! You are much greater than I had heard .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	7	Your people and officials are very lucky , because in always serving you , they are able to hear your wisdom .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Praise the Lord your God who was pleased to make you king . He has put you on his throne to rule for the Lord your God , because your God loves the people of Israel and supports them forever . He has made you king over them to keep justice and to rule fairly. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	10	Hiram ’ s men and Solomon ’ s men brought gold from Ophir , juniper wood , and jewels .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	11	King Solomon used the juniper wood to build steps for the Temple of the Lord and the palace and to make lyres and harps for the musicians . No one in Judah had ever seen such beautiful things as these .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and asked for , even more than she had brought to him . Then she and her servants returned to her own country . Solomon ’ s Wealth
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	13	Every year King Solomon received about fifty thousand pounds of gold .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	14	Besides that , he also received gold from traders and merchants . All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold , each of which contained about seven and one-half pounds of hammered gold .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	16	He also made three hundred smaller shields of hammered gold , each of which contained about four pounds of gold . The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	17	The king built a large throne of ivory and covered it with pure gold .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	18	The throne had six steps on it and a gold footstool . There were armrests on both sides of the chair , and each armrest had a lion beside it .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	19	Twelve lions stood on the six steps , one lion at each end of each step . Nothing like this had ever been made for any other kingdom .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	20	All of Solomon ’ s drinking cups , as well as the dishes in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon , were made of pure gold . In Solomon ’ s time people did not think silver was valuable .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	21	King Solomon had many ships that he sent out to trade , with Hiram ’ s men as the crews . Every three years the ships returned , bringing back gold , silver , ivory , apes , and baboons .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	22	King Solomon had more riches and wisdom than all the other kings on earth .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	23	All the kings of the earth wanted to see Solomon and listen to the wisdom God had given him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	24	Year after year everyone who came brought gifts of silver and gold , clothes , weapons , spices , horses , and mules .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	25	Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and he had twelve thousand horses . He kept some in special cities for the chariots , and others he kept with him in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	26	Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines , as far as the border of Egypt .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	27	In Jerusalem the king made silver as common as stones and cedar trees as plentiful as the fig trees on the western hills .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	28	Solomon imported horses from Egypt and all other countries . Solomon ’ s Death
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	29	Everything else Solomon did , from the beginning to the end , is written in the records of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer , who wrote about Jeroboam , Nebat ’ s son .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	30	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	31	Then Solomon died and was buried in Jerusalem , the city of David , his father . And Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam became king in his place . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	2%20Chronicles	9	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	2	Jeroboam son of Nebat was in Egypt , where he had gone to escape from King Solomon . When Jeroboam heard about Rehoboam being made king , he returned from Egypt .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	10	The young men who had grown up with him answered , “ The people said to you , ‘ Your father forced us to work very hard . Now make our work easier. ’ You should tell them , ‘ My little finger is bigger than my father ’ s legs .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	3	After the people sent for him , he and the people went to Rehoboam and said to him ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Your father forced us to work very hard . Now , make it easier for us , and don ’ t make us work as he did . Then we will serve you. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	5	Rehoboam answered , “ Come back to me in three days. ” So the people left .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	6	King Rehoboam asked the elders who had advised Solomon during his lifetime , “ How do you think I should answer these people ? ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	7	They answered , “ Be kind to these people . If you please them and give them a kind answer , they will serve you always. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But Rehoboam rejected this advice . Instead , he asked the young men who had grown up with him and who served as his advisers .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	9	Rehoboam asked them , “ What is your advice ? How should we answer these people who said , ‘ Don ’ t make us work as hard as your father did ’ ? ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	11	He forced you to work hard , but I will make you work even harder . My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	12	Rehoboam had told the people , “ Come back to me in three days. ” So after three days Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	13	King Rehoboam spoke cruel words to them , because he had rejected the advice of the elders .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	14	He followed the advice of the young men and said , “ My father forced you to work hard , but I will make you work even harder . My father beat you with whips , but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king did not listen to the people . God caused this to happen so that the Lord could keep the promise he had made to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah , a prophet from Shiloh .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	16	When all the Israelites saw that the king refused to listen to them , they said to the king , “ We have no share in David ! We have no part in the son of Jesse ! People of Israel , let ’ s go to our own homes ! Let David ’ s son rule his own people. ” So all the Israelites went home .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	10	18	Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor . When Rehoboam sent him to the people , they threw stones at him until he died . But King Rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	2	But the Lord spoke his word to Shemaiah , a man of God , saying ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	11	When Rehoboam made those cities strong , he put commanders and supplies of food , oil , and wine in them .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	4	‘ The Lord says you must not go to war against your brothers . Every one of you should go home , because I made all these things happen. ’ ” So they obeyed the Lord ’ s command and turned back and did not attack Jeroboam . Rehoboam Makes Judah Strong

NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	13	The priests and the Levites from all over Israel joined Rehoboam .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	14	The Levites even left their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem , because Jeroboam and his sons refused to let them serve as priests to the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	15	Jeroboam chose his own priests for the places of worship and for the goat and calf idols he had made .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	11	16	There were people from all the tribes of Israel who wanted to obey the Lord , the God of Israel . So they went to Jerusalem with the Levites to sacrifice to the Lord , the God of their ancestors .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	12	7	When the Lord saw they were sorry for what they had done , the Lord spoke his word to Shemaiah , saying , “ The king and the leaders are sorry . So I will not destroy them but will save them soon . I will not use Shishak to punish Jerusalem in my anger .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	13	7	Then worthless , evil men joined Jeroboam against Rehoboam , Solomon ’ s son . He was young and didn ’ t know what to do , so he could not stop them .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	13	14	When the soldiers of Judah turned around , they saw Jeroboam ’ s army attacking both in front and back . So they cried out to the Lord , and the priests blew the trumpets .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	13	15	Then the men of Judah gave a battle cry . When they shouted , God caused Jeroboam and the army of Israel to run away from Abijah and the army of Judah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	13	16	When the army of Israel ran away from the men of Judah , God handed them over to Judah .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	14	They destroyed all the towns near Gerar , because the people living in these towns were afraid of the Lord . Since these towns had many valuable things , Asa ’ s army took them away .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	3	He removed the foreign altars and the places where gods were worshiped . He smashed the stone pillars that honored other gods , and he tore down the Asherah idols .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	4	Asa commanded the people of Judah to follow the Lord , the God of their ancestors , and to obey his teachings and commandments .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	5	He also removed the places where gods were worshiped and the incense altars from every town in Judah . So the kingdom had peace while Asa was king .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	6	Asa built strong , walled cities in Judah during the time of peace . He had no war in these years , because the Lord gave him peace .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	7	Asa said to the people of Judah , “ Let ’ s build up these towns and put walls around them . Let ’ s make towers , gates , and bars in the gates . This country is ours , because we have obeyed the Lord our God . We have followed him , and he has given us peace all around. ” So they built and had success .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah and two hundred eighty thousand men from Benjamin . The men from Judah carried large shields and spears . The men from Benjamin carried small shields and bows and arrows . All of them were brave fighting men .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	14	10	So Asa went out to fight Zerah and prepared for battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	15	All the people of Judah were happy about the promise , because they had promised with all their heart . They looked for God and found him . So the Lord gave them peace in all the country .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	3	For a long time Israel was without the true God and without a priest to teach them and without the teachings .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But when they were in trouble , they turned to the Lord , the God of Israel . They looked for him and found him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	5	In those days no one could travel safely . There was much trouble in all the nations .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	6	One nation would destroy another nation , and one city would destroy another city , because God troubled them with all kinds of distress .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But you should be strong . Don ’ t give up , because you will get a reward for your good work. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	8	Asa felt brave when he heard these words and the message from Azariah son of Oded the prophet . So he removed the hateful idols from all of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim . He repaired the Lord ’ s altar that was in front of the porch of the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then Asa gathered all the people from Judah and Benjamin and from the tribes of Ephraim , Manasseh , and Simeon who were living in Judah . Many people came to Asa even from Israel , because they saw that the Lord , Asa ’ s God , was with him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	10	Asa and these people gathered in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa ’ s rule .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	11	At that time they sacrificed to the Lord seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats from the valuable things Asa ’ s army had taken from their enemies .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	12	Then they made an agreement to obey the Lord , the God of their ancestors , with their whole being .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	13	Anyone who refused to obey the Lord , the God of Israel , was to be killed . It did not matter if that person was important or unimportant , a man or woman .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	14	Then Asa and the people made a promise before the Lord , shouting with a loud voice and blowing trumpets and sheep ’ s horns .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	16	King Asa also removed Maacah , his grandmother , from being queen mother , because she had made a terrible Asherah idol . Asa cut down that idol , smashed it into pieces , and burned it in the Kidron Valley .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	17	But the places of worship to gods were not removed from Judah . Even so , Asa was faithful all his life .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	15	18	Asa brought into the Temple of God the gifts he and his father had given : silver , gold , and utensils .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa ’ s rule , Baasha king of Israel attacked Judah . He made the town of Ramah strong so he could keep people from leaving or entering Judah , Asa ’ s country .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ Let there be a treaty between you and me as there was between my father and your father . I am sending you silver and gold . Break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will leave my land. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	4	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies to attack the towns of Israel . They defeated the towns of Ijon , Dan , and Abel Beth Maacah , and all the towns in Naphtali where treasures were stored .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	5	When Baasha heard about this , he stopped building up Ramah and left his work .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then King Asa brought all the people of Judah to Ramah , and they carried away the rocks and wood that Baasha had used . And they used them to build up Geba and Mizpah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him , “ You depended on the king of Aram to help you and not on the Lord your God . So the king of Aram ’ s army escaped from you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	8	The Cushites and Libyans had a large and powerful army and many chariots and horsemen . But you depended on the Lord to help you , so he handed them over to you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	9	The Lord searches all the earth for people who have given themselves completely to him . He wants to make them strong . Asa , you did a foolish thing , so from now on you will have wars. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Asa was angry with Hanani the seer because of what he had said ; he was so angry that he put Hanani in prison . And Asa was cruel to some of the people at the same time .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Isn ’ t there a prophet of the Lord here ? Let ’ s ask him what we should do. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	18	7	Then King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ There is one other prophet . We could ask the Lord through him , but I hate him . He never prophesies anything good about me , but always something bad . He is Micaiah son of Imlah. ” Jehoshaphat said , “ King Ahab , you shouldn ’ t say that ! ”

NCV	2%20Chronicles	18	16	So Micaiah answered , “ I saw the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd . The Lord said , ‘ They have no leaders . They should go home and not fight. ’ ”

NCV	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Micaiah answered , “ You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inside room. ”

NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	10	All the officers and people were happy to bring their money , and they put it in the box until the box was full .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	11	When the Levites would take the box to the king ’ s officers , they would see that it was full of money .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	18	The king and these leaders stopped worshiping in the Temple of the Lord , the God of their ancestors . Instead , they began to worship the Asherah idols and other idols . Because they did wrong , God was angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	19	Even though the Lord sent prophets to the people to turn them back to him and even though the prophets warned them , they refused to listen .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	20	Then the Spirit of God entered Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest . Zechariah stood before the people and said , “ This is what God says : ‘ Why do you disobey the Lord ’ s commands ? You will not be successful . Because you have left the Lord , he has also left you. ’ ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	21	But the king and his officers made plans against Zechariah . At the king ’ s command they threw stones at him in the courtyard of the Temple of the Lord until he died .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	22	King Joash did not remember Jehoiada ’ s kindness to him , so Joash killed Zechariah , Jehoiada ’ s son . Before Zechariah died , he said , “ May the Lord see what you are doing and punish you. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	24	23	At the end of the year , the Aramean army came against Joash . They attacked Judah and Jerusalem , killed all the leaders of the people , and sent all the valuable things to their king in Damascus .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	4	But Amaziah did not put to death their children .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	9	Amaziah said to the man of God , “ But what about the seventy-five hundred pounds of silver I paid to the Israelite army ? ” The man of God answered , “ The Lord can give you much more than that. ”

NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Then Amaziah became very brave and led his army to the Valley of Salt in the country of Edom . There Amaziah ’ s army killed ten thousand Edomites .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	16	As the prophet spoke , Amaziah said to him , “ We never gave you the job of advising the king . Stop , or you will be killed. ” The prophet stopped speaking except to say , “ I know that God has decided to destroy you because you have done this . You did not listen to my advice. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	17	Amaziah king of Judah talked with those who advised him . Then he sent a message to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz , who was the son of Jehu king of Israel . Amaziah said to Jehoash , “ Come , let ’ s meet face to face. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	18	Then Jehoash king of Israel answered Amaziah king of Judah , “ A thornbush in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree in Lebanon . It said , ‘ Let your daughter marry my son. ’ But then a wild animal from Lebanon came by , walking on and crushing the thornbush .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	19	You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom , but you have become proud , and you brag . But you stay at home ! Don ’ t ask for trouble , or you and Judah will be defeated. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah would not listen . God caused this to happen so that Jehoash would defeat Judah , because Judah asked for help from the gods of Edom .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	21	So Jehoash king of Israel went to attack . He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	22	Israel defeated Judah , and every man of Judah ran away to his home .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	23	At Beth Shemesh Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah . ( Amaziah was the son of Joash , who was the son of Ahaziah . ) Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem . Jehoash broke down the wall of Jerusalem , from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate , about six hundred feet .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	24	He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils from the Temple of God that Obed-Edom had taken care of . He also took the treasures from the palace and some hostages . Then he returned to Samaria .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	26	The other things Amaziah did as king , from the beginning to the end , are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	27	When Amaziah stopped obeying the Lord , the people in Jerusalem made plans against him . So he ran away to the town of Lachish , but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	25	28	They brought his body back on horses , and he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem , the city of David . Footnotes - 25:4 “ Parents . . . sins. ” See Deuteronomy 24:16 . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	2	He rebuilt the town of Elath and made it part of Judah again after Amaziah died .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	26	Then all the people of Judah made Uzziah [ a ] king in place of his father Amaziah . Uzziah was sixteen years old .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king , and he ruled fifty-two years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Jecoliah , and she was from Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	4	He did what the Lord said was right , just as his father Amaziah had done .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	5	Uzziah obeyed God while Zechariah was alive , because he taught Uzziah how to respect and obey God . And as long as Uzziah obeyed the Lord , God gave him success .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	6	Uzziah fought a war against the Philistines . He tore down the walls around their towns of Gath , Jabneh , and Ashdod and built new towns near Ashdod and in other places among the Philistines .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	7	God helped Uzziah fight the Philistines , the Arabs living in Gur Baal , and the Meunites .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	8	Also , the Ammonites made the payments Uzziah demanded . He was very powerful , so his name became famous all the way to the border of Egypt .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	9	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate , the Valley Gate , and where the wall turned , and he made them strong .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	10	He also built towers in the desert and dug many wells , because he had many cattle on the western hills and in the plains . He had people who worked his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands , because he loved the land .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	11	Uzziah had an army of trained soldiers . They were counted and put in groups by Jeiel the royal secretary and Maaseiah the officer . Hananiah , one of the king ’ s commanders , was their leader .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	12	There were twenty-six hundred leaders over the soldiers .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	13	They were in charge of an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred men who fought with great power to help the king against the enemy .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	14	Uzziah gave his army shields , spears , helmets , armor , bows , and stones for their slings .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	15	In Jerusalem Uzziah made cleverly designed devices . These devices on the towers and corners of the city walls were used to shoot arrows and large rocks . So Uzziah became famous in faraway places , because he had much help until he became powerful .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But when Uzziah became powerful , his pride led to his ruin . He was unfaithful to the Lord his God ; he went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar for incense .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	17	Azariah and eighty other brave priests who served the Lord followed Uzziah into the Temple .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	18	They told him he was wrong and said to him , “ You don ’ t have the right to burn incense to the Lord . Only the priests , Aaron ’ s descendants , should burn the incense , because they have been made holy . Leave this holy place . You have been unfaithful , and the Lord God will not honor you for this. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	19	Uzziah was standing beside the altar for incense in the Temple of the Lord , and in his hand was a pan for burning incense . He was very angry with the priests . As he was standing in front of the priests , a skin disease broke out on his forehead .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	20	Azariah , the leading priest , and all the other priests looked at him and saw the skin disease on his forehead . So they hurried him out of the Temple . Uzziah also rushed out , because the Lord was punishing him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	21	So King Uzziah had the skin disease until the day he died . He had to live in a separate house and could not enter the Temple of the Lord . His son Jotham was in charge of the palace , and he governed the people of the land .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	22	The other things Uzziah did as king , from beginning to end , were written down by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	26	23	Uzziah died and was buried near his ancestors in a graveyard that belonged to the kings . This was because people said , “ He had a skin disease. ” And his son Jotham became king in his place . Footnotes - 26:1 Uzziah Also called Azariah . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	27	2	Jotham did what the Lord said was right , just as his father Uzziah had done . But Jotham did not enter the Temple of the Lord to burn incense as his father had . But the people continued doing wrong .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	27	27	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king , and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem . His mother ’ s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	27	3	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the Temple of the Lord , and he added greatly to the wall at Ophel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	27	4	He also built towns in the hill country of Judah , as well as walled cities and towers in the forests .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	27	5	Jotham also fought the king of the Ammonites and defeated them . So each year for three years they gave Jotham about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver , about sixty-two thousand bushels of wheat , and about sixty-two thousand bushels of barley .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	27	6	Jotham became powerful , because he always obeyed the Lord his God .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	2	Ahaz did the same things the kings of Israel had done . He made metal idols to worship Baal .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king , and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem . Unlike his ancestor David , he did not do what the Lord said was right .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	3	He burned incense in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and made his children pass through the fire . He did the same hateful sins as the nations had done whom the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	4	Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the places where gods were worshiped , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	5	So the Lord his God handed over Ahaz to the king of Aram . The Arameans defeated Ahaz and took many people of Judah as prisoners to Damascus . He also handed over Ahaz to Pekah king of Israel , and Pekah ’ s army killed many soldiers of Ahaz .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	6	The army of Pekah son of Remaliah killed one hundred twenty thousand brave soldiers from Judah in one day . Pekah defeated them because they had left the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	7	Zicri , a warrior from Ephraim , killed King Ahaz ’ s son Maaseiah . He also killed Azrikam , the officer in charge of the palace , and Elkanah , who was second in command to the king .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The Israelite army captured two hundred thousand of their own relatives . They took women , sons and daughters , and many valuable things from Judah and carried them back to Samaria .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there . He met the Israelite army when it returned to Samaria and said to them , “ The Lord , the God of your ancestors , handed Judah over to you , because he was angry with those people . But God has seen the cruel way you killed them .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	10	Now you plan to make the people of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves , but you also have sinned against the Lord your God .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Now listen to me . Send back your brothers and sisters whom you captured , because the Lord is very angry with you. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Then some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan , Berekiah son of Meshillemoth , Jehizkiah son of Shallum , and Amasa son of Hadlai—met the Israelite soldiers coming home from war .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	13	They warned the soldiers , “ Don ’ t bring the prisoners from Judah here . If you do , we will be guilty of sin against the Lord , and that will make our sin and guilt even worse . Our guilt is already so great that he is angry with Israel. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	14	So the soldiers left the prisoners and valuable things in front of the officers and people there .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	15	The leaders who were named took the prisoners and gave those who were naked the clothes that the Israelite army had taken . They gave the prisoners clothes , sandals , food , drink , and medicine . They put the weak prisoners on donkeys and took them back to their families in Jericho , the city of palm trees . Then they returned home to Samaria . 16-17 At that time the Edomites came again and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners . So King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	18	The Philistines also robbed the towns in the western hills and in southern Judah . They captured the towns of Beth Shemesh , Aijalon , Gederoth , Soco , Timnah , and Gimzo , and the villages around them . Then the Philistines lived in those towns .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	19	The Lord brought trouble on Judah because Ahaz their king led the people of Judah to sin , and he was unfaithful to the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	20	Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to Ahaz , but he gave Ahaz trouble instead of help .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	21	Ahaz took some valuable things from the Temple of the Lord , from the palace , and from the princes , and he gave them to the king of Assyria , but it did not help .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	22	During Ahaz ’ s troubles he was even more unfaithful to the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of the people of Damascus , who had defeated him . He thought , “ The gods of the kings of Aram helped them . If I offer sacrifices to them , they will help me also. ” But this brought ruin to Ahaz and all Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	24	Ahaz gathered the things from the Temple of God and broke them into pieces . Then he closed the doors of the Temple of the Lord . He made altars and put them on every street corner in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	25	In every town in Judah , Ahaz made places for burning sacrifices to worship other gods . So he made the Lord , the God of his ancestors , very angry .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	28	26	The other things Ahaz did as king , from beginning to end , are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	2	Hezekiah did what the Lord said was right , just as his ancestor David had done .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	29	When the sacrifices were completed , King Hezekiah and everyone with him bowed down and worshiped .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	3	Hezekiah opened the doors of the Temple of the Lord and repaired them in the first month of the first year he was king .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	4	Hezekiah brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the courtyard on the east side of the Temple .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	5	Hezekiah said , “ Listen to me , Levites . Make yourselves ready for the Lord ’ s service , and make holy the Temple of the Lord , the God of your ancestors . Remove from the Temple everything that makes it impure .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	6	Our ancestors were unfaithful to God and did what the Lord said was wrong . They left the Lord and stopped worshiping at the Temple where he lives . They rejected him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They shut the doors of the porch of the Temple , and they let the fire go out in the lamps . They stopped burning incense and offering burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	8	So the Lord became very angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem , and he punished them . Other people are frightened and shocked by what he did to them . So they insult the people of Judah . You know these things are true .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	9	That is why our ancestors were killed in battle and our sons , daughters , and wives were taken captive .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	10	Now I , Hezekiah , have decided to make an agreement with the Lord , the God of Israel , so he will not be angry with us anymore .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , don ’ t waste any more time . The Lord chose you to stand before him , to serve him , to be his servants , and to burn incense to him. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	12	These are the Levites who started to work . From the Kohathite family there were Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah . From the Merarite family there were Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel . From the Gershonite family there were Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	13	From Elizaphan ’ s family there were Shimri and Jeiel . From Asaph ’ s family there were Zechariah and Mattaniah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	14	From Heman ’ s family there were Jehiel and Shimei . From Jeduthun ’ s family there were Shemaiah and Uzziel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	15	These Levites gathered their brothers together and made themselves holy for service in the Temple . Then they went into the Temple of the Lord to purify it . They obeyed the king ’ s command that had come from the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	16	When the priests went into the Temple of the Lord to purify it , they took out all the unclean things they found in the Temple of the Lord and put them in the Temple courtyard . Then the Levites took these things out to the Kidron Valley .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	17	Beginning on the first day of the first month , they made the Temple holy for the Lord ’ s service . On the eighth day of the month , they came to the porch of the Temple , and for eight more days they made the Temple of the Lord holy . So they finished on the sixteenth day of the first month .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went to King Hezekiah and said , “ We have purified the entire Temple of the Lord , the altar for burnt offerings and its utensils , and the table for the holy bread and all its utensils .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	19	When Ahaz was king , he was unfaithful to God and removed some things from the Temple . But we have put them back and made them holy for the Lord . They are now in front of the Lord ’ s altar. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the leaders of the city and went up to the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	21	They brought seven bulls , seven male sheep , seven lambs , and seven male goats . These animals were an offering to remove the sin of the people and the kingdom of Judah and to make the Temple ready for service to God . King Hezekiah commanded the priests , the descendants of Aaron , to offer these animals on the Lord ’ s altar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	22	So the priests killed the bulls and sprinkled their blood on the altar . They killed the sheep and sprinkled their blood on the altar . Then they killed the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	23	Then the priests brought the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the people there . After the king and the people put their hands on the goats ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	24	the priests killed them . With the goats ’ blood they made an offering on the altar to remove the sins of the Israelites so they would belong to God . The king had said that the burnt offering and sin offering should be made for all Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	25	King Hezekiah put the Levites in the Temple of the Lord with cymbals , harps , and lyres , as David , Gad , and Nathan had commanded . ( Gad was the king ’ s seer , and Nathan was a prophet . ) This command came from the Lord through his prophets .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	26	So the Levites stood ready with David ’ s instruments of music , and the priests stood ready with their trumpets .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar . When the burnt offering began , the singing to the Lord also began . The trumpets were blown , and the musical instruments of David king of Israel were played .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	28	All the people worshiped , the singers sang , and the trumpeters blew their trumpets until the burnt offering was finished .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	30	King Hezekiah and his officers ordered the Levites to praise the Lord , using the words David and Asaph the seer had used . So they praised God with joy and bowed down and worshiped .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah said , “ Now that you people of Judah have given yourselves to the Lord , come near to the Temple of the Lord . Bring sacrifices and offerings , to show thanks to him. ” So the people brought sacrifices and thank offerings , and anyone who was willing also brought burnt offerings .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	32	For burnt offerings they brought a total of seventy bulls , one hundred male sheep , and two hundred lambs ; all these animals were sacrificed as burnt offerings to the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	33	The holy offerings totaled six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	34	There were not enough priests to skin all the animals for the burnt offerings . So their relatives the Levites helped them until the work was finished and other priests could be made holy . The Levites had been more careful to make themselves holy for the Lord ’ s service than the priests .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	29	35	There were many burnt offerings along with the fat of fellowship offerings and drink offerings . So the service in the Temple of the Lord began again .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	2	King Hezekiah , his officers , and all the people in Jerusalem agreed to celebrate the Passover in the second month .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	30	King Hezekiah sent messages to all the people of Israel and Judah , and he wrote letters to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh . Hezekiah invited all these people to come to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	3	They could not celebrate it at the normal time , because not enough priests had made themselves ready to serve the Lord , and the people had not yet gathered in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	4	This plan satisfied King Hezekiah and all the people .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	5	So they made an announcement everywhere in Israel , from Beersheba to Dan , [ a ] telling the people to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for the Lord , the God of Israel . For a long time most of the people had not celebrated the Passover as the law commanded .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	6	At the king ’ s command , the messengers took letters from him and his officers all through Israel and Judah . This is what the letters said : People of Israel , return to the Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . Then God will return to you who are still alive , who have escaped from the kings of Assyria .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	7	Don ’ t be like your ancestors or your relatives . They turned against the Lord , the God of their ancestors , so he caused other people to be disgusted with them . You know this is true .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Don ’ t be stubborn as your ancestors were , but obey the Lord willingly . Come to the Temple , which he has made holy forever . Serve the Lord your God so he will not be angry with you .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	9	Come back to the Lord . Then the people who captured your relatives and children will be kind to them and will let them return to this land . The Lord your God is kind and merciful . He will not turn away from you if you return to him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	10	The messengers went to every town in Ephraim and Manasseh , and all the way to Zebulun , but the people laughed at them and made fun of them .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	11	But some men from Asher , Manasseh , and Zebulun were sorry for what they had done and went to Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	12	And God united all the people of Judah in obeying King Hezekiah and his officers , because their command had come from the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	13	In the second month a large crowd came together in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	14	The people removed the altars and incense altars to gods in Jerusalem and threw them into the Kidron Valley .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	15	They killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month . The priests and the Levites were ashamed , so they made themselves holy and brought burnt offerings into the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	16	They took their regular places in the Temple as the Teachings of Moses , the man of God , commanded . The Levites gave the blood of the sacrifices to the priests , who sprinkled it on the altar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	17	Since many people in the crowd had not made themselves holy , the Levites killed the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean . The Levites made each lamb holy for the Lord . 18-19 Although many people from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar , and Zebulun had not purified themselves for the feast , they ate the Passover even though it was against the law . So Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , “ Lord , you are good . You are the Lord , the God of our ancestors . Please forgive all those who try to obey you even if they did not make themselves clean as the rules of the Temple command. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	20	The Lord listened to Hezekiah ’ s prayer , and he healed the people .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	21	The Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy to the Lord . The Levites and priests praised the Lord every day with loud music .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	22	Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who showed they understood well how to do their service for the Lord . The people ate the feast for seven days , offered fellowship offerings , and praised the Lord , the God of their ancestors .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	23	Then all the people agreed to stay seven more days , so they celebrated with joy for seven more days .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	24	Hezekiah king of Judah gave one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep to the people . The officers gave one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep to the people . Many priests made themselves holy .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	25	All the people of Judah , the priests , the Levites , those who came from Israel , the foreigners from Israel , and the foreigners living in Judah were very happy .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	26	There was much joy in Jerusalem , because there had not been a celebration like this since the time of Solomon son of David and king of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	30	27	The priests and Levites stood up and blessed the people , and God heard them because their prayer reached heaven , his holy home .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	31	2	King Hezekiah appointed groups of priests and Levites for their special duties . They were to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings , to worship , and to give thanks and praise at the gates of the Lord ’ s house .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	31	31	When the Passover celebration was finished , all the Israelites in Jerusalem went out to the towns of Judah . There they smashed the stone pillars used to worship gods . They cut down the Asherah idols and destroyed the altars and places for worshiping gods in all of Judah , Benjamin , Ephraim , and Manasseh . After they had destroyed all of them , the Israelites returned to their own towns and homes .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	31	3	Hezekiah gave some of his own animals for the burnt offerings , which were given every morning and evening , on Sabbath days , during New Moons , and at other feasts commanded in the Lord ’ s Teachings .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	31	8	When Hezekiah and his officers came and saw the piles , they praised the Lord and his people , the people of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	31	9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	32	Hezekiah ’ s love for God and the other things he did as king are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz . This is in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	3	So Hezekiah and his officers and army commanders decided to cut off the water from the springs outside the city . So the officers and commanders helped Hezekiah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	4	Many people came and cut off all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land . They said , “ The king of Assyria will not find much water when he comes here. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Then Hezekiah made Jerusalem stronger . He rebuilt all the broken parts of the wall and put towers on it . He also built another wall outside the first one and strengthened the area that was filled in on the east side of the old part of Jerusalem . He also made many weapons and shields .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	6	Hezekiah put army commanders over the people and met with them at the open place near the city gate . Hezekiah encouraged them , saying ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	7	“ Be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid or worried because of the king of Assyria or his large army . There is a greater power with us than with him .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	8	He only has men , but we have the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. ” The people were encouraged by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this King Sennacherib of Assyria and all his army surrounded and attacked Lachish . Then he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah in Jerusalem :
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	10	Sennacherib king of Assyria says this : “ You have nothing to trust in to help you . It is no use for you to stay in Jerusalem under attack .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Hezekiah says to you , ‘ The Lord our God will save us from the king of Assyria , ’ but he is fooling you . If you stay in Jerusalem , you will die from hunger and thirst .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Hezekiah himself removed your Lord ’ s places of worship and altars . He told you people of Judah and Jerusalem that you must worship and burn incense on only one altar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	13	“ You know what my ancestors and I have done to all the people in other nations . The gods of those nations could not save their people from my power .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	14	My ancestors destroyed those nations ; none of their gods could save them from me . So your god can not save you from my power .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	15	Do not let Hezekiah fool you or trick you , and do not believe him . No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from me or my ancestors . Your god is even less able to save you from me. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	16	Sennacherib ’ s officers said worse things against the Lord God and his servant Hezekiah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	17	King Sennacherib also wrote letters insulting the Lord , the God of Israel . They spoke against him , saying , “ The gods of the other nations could not save their people from me . In the same way Hezekiah ’ s god won ’ t be able to save his people from me. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	18	Then the king ’ s officers shouted in Hebrew , calling out to the people of Jerusalem who were on the city wall . The officers wanted to scare the people away so they could capture Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	19	They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as though he were like the gods the people of the world worshiped , which are made by human hands .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	20	King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed to heaven about this .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	21	Then the Lord sent an angel who killed all the soldiers , leaders , and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria . So the king went back to his own country in disgrace . When he went into the temple of his god , some of his own sons killed him with a sword .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	22	So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem from Sennacherib king of Assyria and from all other people . He took care of them on every side .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	23	Many people brought gifts for the Lord to Jerusalem , and they also brought valuable gifts to King Hezekiah of Judah . From then on all the nations respected Hezekiah . Hezekiah Dies
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	24	At that time Hezekiah became so sick he almost died . When he prayed to the Lord , the Lord spoke to him and gave him a sign . [ a ]
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah did not thank God for his kindness , because he was so proud . So the Lord was angry with him and the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	26	But later Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem were sorry and stopped being proud , so the Lord did not punish them while Hezekiah was alive .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	27	Hezekiah had many riches and much honor . He made treasuries for his silver , gold , gems , spices , shields , and other valuable things .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	28	He built storage buildings for grain , new wine , and oil and stalls for all the cattle and pens for the sheep .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	29	He also built many towns . He had many flocks and herds , because God had given Hezekiah much wealth .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	30	It was Hezekiah who cut off the upper pool of the Gihon spring and made those waters flow straight down to the west side of the older part of Jerusalem . And Hezekiah was successful in everything he did .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	31	But one time the leaders of Babylon sent messengers to Hezekiah , asking him about a strange sign that had happened in the land . When they came , God left Hezekiah alone to test him so he could know everything that was in Hezekiah ’ s heart . [ b ]
NCV	2%20Chronicles	32	33	Hezekiah died and was buried on a hill , where the graves of David ’ s ancestors are . All the people of Judah and Jerusalem honored Hezekiah when he died , and his son Manasseh became king in his place . Footnotes - 32:24 sign See Isaiah 38:1–8 .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	2	He did what the Lord said was wrong . He did the hateful things the nations had done—the nations that the Lord had forced out of the land ahead of the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	33	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king , and he was king for fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	3	Manasseh ’ s father , Hezekiah , had torn down the places where gods were worshiped , but Manasseh rebuilt them . He also built altars for the Baal gods , and he made Asherah idols and worshiped all the stars of the sky and served them .

He got advice from mediums and fortune-tellers . He did many things the Lord said were wrong , which made the Lord angry .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	7	Manasseh carved an idol and put it in the Temple of God . God had said to David and his son Solomon about the Temple , “ I will be worshiped forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	8	I will never again make the Israelites leave the land I gave to their ancestors . But they must obey everything I have commanded them in all the teachings , rules , and commands I gave them through Moses. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	9	But Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to do wrong . They did more evil than the nations the Lord had destroyed ahead of the Israelites .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	10	The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people , but they did not listen .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	11	So the Lord brought the king of Assyria ’ s army commanders to attack Judah . They captured Manasseh , put hooks in him , placed bronze chains on his hands , and took him to Babylon .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	12	As Manasseh suffered , he begged the Lord his God for help and humbled himself before the God of his ancestors .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	13	When Manasseh prayed , the Lord heard him and had pity on him . So the Lord let him return to Jerusalem and to his kingdom . Then Manasseh knew that the Lord is the true God .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	14	After that happened , Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of Jerusalem and made it higher . It was in the valley on the west side of the Gihon spring and went to the entrance of the Fish Gate and around the hill of Ophel . Then he put commanders in all the strong , walled cities in Judah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	15	Manasseh removed the idols of other nations , including the idol in the Temple of the Lord . He removed all the altars he had built on the Temple hill and in Jerusalem and threw them out of the city .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	16	Then he set up the Lord ’ s altar and sacrificed on it fellowship offerings and offerings to show thanks to God . Manasseh commanded all the people of Judah to serve the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	17	The people continued to offer sacrifices at the places of worship , but their sacrifices were only to the Lord their God .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	18	The other things Manasseh did as king , his prayer to his God , and what the seers said to him in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel—all are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	19	Manasseh ’ s prayer and God ’ s pity for him , his sins , his unfaithfulness , the places he built for worshiping gods and the Asherah idols before he humbled himself—all are written in the book of the seers .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	22	He did what the Lord said was wrong , as his father Manasseh had done . Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the carved idols Manasseh had made .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	23	Amon did not humble himself before the Lord as his father Manasseh had done . Instead , Amon sinned even more .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	33	24	King Amon ’ s officers made plans against him and killed him in his palace .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Josiah was eight years old when he became king , and he ruled thirty-one years in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	3	In his eighth year as king while he was still young , Josiah began to obey the God of his ancestor David . In his twelfth year as king , Josiah began to remove from Judah and Jerusalem the gods , the places for worshiping gods , the Asherah idols , and the wooden and metal idols .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	4	The people tore down the altars for the Baal gods as Josiah directed . Then Josiah cut down the incense altars that were above them . He broke up the Asherah idols and the wooden and metal idols and beat them into powder . Then he sprinkled the powder on the graves of the people who had offered sacrifices to these gods .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	5	He burned the bones of their priests on their own altars . So Josiah removed idol worship from Judah and Jerusalem ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	6	and from the towns in the areas of Manasseh , Ephraim , and Simeon all the way to Naphtali , and in the ruins near these towns .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	7	Josiah broke down the altars and Asherah idols and beat the idols into powder . He cut down all the incense altars in all of Israel . Then he went back to Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	8	In Josiah ’ s eighteenth year as king , he made Judah and the Temple pure again . He sent Shaphan son of Azaliah , Maaseiah the city leader , and Joah son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the Temple of the Lord , the God of Josiah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	9	These men went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money the Levite gatekeepers had gathered from the people of Manasseh , Ephraim , and all the Israelites who were left alive , and also from all the people of Judah , Benjamin , and Jerusalem . This is the money they had brought into the Temple of God .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	10	Then the Levites gave it to the supervisors of the work on the Temple of the Lord , and they paid the workers who rebuilt and repaired the Temple .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	11	They gave money to carpenters and builders to buy cut stone and wood . The wood was used to rebuild the buildings and to make beams for them , because the kings of Judah had let the buildings fall into ruin .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	12	The men did their work well . Their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah , who were Levites from the family of Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , who were from the family of Kohath . These Levites were all skilled musicians .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	13	They were also in charge of the workers who carried loads and all the other workers . Some Levites worked as secretaries , officers , and gatekeepers . The Book of the Teachings Is Found
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	14	The Levites brought out the money that was in the Temple of the Lord . As they were doing this , Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Lord ’ s Teachings that had been given through Moses .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	15	Hilkiah said to Shaphan the royal secretary , “ I ’ ve found the Book of the Teachings in the Temple of the Lord ! ” Then he gave it to Shaphan .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	16	Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to Josiah , “ Your officers are doing everything you told them to do .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	17	They have paid out the money that was in the Temple of the Lord and have given it to the supervisors and the workers. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	18	Then Shaphan the royal secretary told the king , “ Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. ” And Shaphan read from the book to the king .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	19	When the king heard the words of the Teachings , he tore his clothes to show how upset he was .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	20	He gave orders to Hilkiah , Ahikam son of Shaphan , Acbor son of Micaiah , Shaphan the royal secretary , and Asaiah , the king ’ s servant . These were the orders :
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	21	“ Go and ask the Lord about the words in the book that was found . Ask for me and for the people who are left alive in Israel and Judah . The Lord is very angry with us , because our ancestors did not obey the Lord ’ s word ; they did not do everything this book says to do. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	22	So Hilkiah and those the king sent with him went to talk to Huldah the prophetess . She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , who took care of the king ’ s clothes . Huldah lived in Jerusalem , in the new area of the city .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	23	She said to them , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Tell the man who sent you to me ,
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	24	‘ This is what the Lord says : I will bring trouble to this place and to the people living here . I will bring all the curses that are written in the book that was read to the king of Judah .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	25	The people of Judah have left me and have burned incense to other gods . They have made me angry by all the evil things they have made . So I will punish them in my anger , which will not be put out. ’
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	26	Tell the king of Judah , who sent you to ask the Lord , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says about the words you heard :
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	27	When you heard my words against this place and its people , you became sorry for what you had done and you humbled yourself before me . You tore your clothes to show how upset you were , and you cried in my presence . This is why I have heard you , says the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	28	So I will let you die and be buried in peace . You won ’ t see all the trouble I will bring to this place and the people living here. ’ ” So they took her message back to the king .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	29	Then the king gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem together .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	30	He went up to the Temple of the Lord , and all the people from Judah and from Jerusalem went with him . The priests , the Levites , and all the people—from the most important to the least important—went with him . He read to them all the words in the Book of the Agreement that was found in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	31	The king stood by his pillar and made an agreement in the presence of the Lord to follow the Lord and obey his commands , rules , and laws with his whole being and to obey the words of the agreement written in this book .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	32	Then Josiah made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin promise to accept the agreement . So the people of Jerusalem obeyed the agreement of God , the God of their ancestors .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	34	33	And Josiah threw out the hateful idols from all the land that belonged to the Israelites . He led everyone in Israel to serve the Lord their God .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	35	King Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem . The Passover lamb was killed on the fourteenth day of the first month .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	3	The Levites taught the Israelites and were made holy for service to the Lord . Josiah said to them , “ Put the Holy Ark in the Temple that David ’ s son Solomon , the king of Israel , built . Do not carry it from place to place on your shoulders anymore . Now serve the Lord your God and his people Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	4	Prepare yourselves by your family groups for service , and do the jobs that King David and his son Solomon gave you to do .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	5	“ Stand in the holy place with a group of the Levites for each family group of the people .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	6	Kill the Passover lambs , and make yourselves holy to the Lord . Prepare the lambs for your relatives , the people of Israel , as the Lord through Moses commanded us to do. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Josiah gave the Israelites thirty thousand sheep and goats to kill for the Passover sacrifices , and he gave them three thousand cattle . They were all his own animals .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	8	Josiah ’ s officers also gave willingly to the people , the priests , and the Levites . Hilkiah , Zechariah , and Jehiel , the officers in charge of the Temple , gave the priests twenty-six hundred lambs and goats and three hundred cattle for Passover sacrifices .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	10	When everything was ready for the Passover service , the priests and Levites went to their places , as the king had commanded .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	11	The Passover lambs were killed . Then the Levites skinned the animals and gave the blood to the priests , who sprinkled it on the altar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	12	Then they gave the animals for the burnt offerings to the different family groups so the burnt offerings could be offered to the Lord as was written in the book of Moses . They also did this with the cattle .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	13	The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire as they were commanded , and they boiled the holy offerings in pots , kettles , and pans . Then they quickly gave the meat to the people .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	14	After this was finished , the Levites prepared meat for themselves and for the priests , the descendants of Aaron . The priests worked until night , offering the burnt offerings and burning the fat of the sacrifices .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	15	The Levite singers from Asaph ’ s family stood in the places chosen for them by King David , Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun , the king ’ s seer . The gatekeepers at each gate did not have to leave their places , because their fellow Levites had prepared everything for them for the Passover .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So everything was done that day for the worship of the Lord , as King Josiah commanded . The Passover was celebrated , and the burnt offerings were offered on the Lord ’ s altar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	17	The Israelites who were there celebrated the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	18	The Passover had not been celebrated like this in Israel since the prophet Samuel was alive . None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated a Passover like it was celebrated by King Josiah , the priests , the Levites , the people of Judah and Israel who were there , and the people of Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	19	This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year Josiah was king . The Death of Josiah
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	20	After Josiah did all this for the Temple , Neco king of Egypt led an army to attack Carchemish , a town on the Euphrates River . And Josiah marched out to fight against Neco .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But Neco sent messengers to Josiah , saying , “ King Josiah , there should not be war between us . I did not come to fight you , but my enemies . God told me to hurry , and he is on my side . So don ’ t fight God , or he will destroy you. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah did not go away . He wore different clothes so no one would know who he was . Refusing to listen to what Neco said at God ’ s command , Josiah went to fight on the plain of Megiddo .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	23	In the battle King Josiah was shot by archers . He told his servants , “ Take me away because I am badly wounded. ”
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	24	So they took him out of his chariot and put him in another chariot and carried him to Jerusalem . There he died and was buried in the graves where his ancestors were buried . All the people of Judah and Jerusalem were very sad because he was dead .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Jeremiah wrote some sad songs about Josiah . Even to this day all the men and women singers remember and honor Josiah with these songs .

NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	9	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah , and he was king in Jerusalem for three months and ten days . He did what the Lord said was wrong .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	10	In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Jehoiachin and brought him and some valuable treasures from the Temple of the Lord to Babylon . Then Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin ’ s uncle Zedekiah the king of Judah and Jerusalem . Zedekiah King of Judah
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king of Judah , and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	12	Zedekiah did what the Lord his God said was wrong . The prophet Jeremiah spoke messages from the Lord , but Zedekiah did not obey .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	13	Zedekiah turned against King Nebuchadnezzar , who had forced him to swear in God ’ s name to be loyal to him . But Zedekiah became stubborn and refused to obey the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	14	Also , all the leaders of the priests and the people of Judah became more wicked , following the evil example of the other nations . The Lord had made the Temple in Jerusalem holy , but the leaders made it unholy . The Fall of Jerusalem
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	15	The Lord , the God of their ancestors , sent prophets again and again to warn his people , because he had pity on them and on his Temple .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But they made fun of God ’ s prophets and hated God ’ s messages . They refused to listen to the prophets until , finally , the Lord became so angry with his people that he could not be stopped .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	17	So God brought the king of Babylon to attack them . The king killed the young men even when they were in the Temple . He had no mercy on the young men or women , the old men or those who were sick . God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	18	Nebuchadnezzar carried away to Babylon all the things from the Temple of God , both large and small , and all the treasures from the Temple of the Lord and from the king and his officers .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	19	Nebuchadnezzar and his army set fire to God ’ s Temple and broke down Jerusalem ’ s wall and burned all the palaces . They took or destroyed every valuable thing in Jerusalem .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	20	Nebuchadnezzar took captive to Babylon the people who were left alive , and he forced them to be slaves for him and his descendants . They remained there as slaves until the Persian kingdom defeated Babylon .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	21	And so what the Lord had told Israel through the prophet Jeremiah happened : The country was an empty wasteland for seventy years to make up for the years of Sabbath rest [ a ] that the people had not kept .
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	22	In the first year Cyrus was king of Persia , the Lord had Cyrus send an announcement to his whole kingdom . This happened so the Lord ’ s message spoken by Jeremiah would come true . He wrote :
NCV	2%20Chronicles	36	23	This is what Cyrus king of Persia says : The Lord , the God of heaven , has given me all the kingdoms of the earth , and he has appointed me to build a Temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah . Now may the Lord your God be with all of you who are his people . You are free to go to Jerusalem . Footnotes - 36:21 Sabbath rest The law said that every seventh year the land was not to be farmed .

NCV	Ezra	1	1	In the first year Cyrus was king of Persia , the Lord caused Cyrus to send an announcement to his whole kingdom and to put it in writing . This happened so the Lord ’ s message spoken by Jeremiah would come true . He wrote :
NCV	Ezra	1	2	This is what Cyrus king of Persia says : The Lord , the God of heaven , has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me , and he has appointed me to build a Temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah .
NCV	Ezra	1	3	May God be with all of you who are his people . You are free to go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the Temple of the Lord , the God of Israel , who is in Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezra	1	4	Those who stay behind , wherever they live , should support those who want to go . Give them silver and gold , supplies and cattle , and special gifts for the Temple of God in Jerusalem .

NCV	Ezra	1	6	All their neighbors helped them , giving them things made of silver and gold , along with supplies , cattle , valuable gifts , and special gifts for the Temple .
NCV	Ezra	1	7	Also , King Cyrus brought out the bowls and pans that belonged in the Temple of the Lord , which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put in the temple of his own god .
NCV	Ezra	1	8	Cyrus king of Persia had Mithredath the treasurer bring them and count them out for Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .

NCV	Ezra	3	3	Even though they were afraid of the people living around them , they built the altar where it had been before . And they offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord morning and evening .
NCV	Ezra	3	2	Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests joined Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and began to build the altar of the God of Israel where they could offer burnt offerings , just as it is written in the Teachings of Moses , the man of God .
NCV	Ezra	3	4	Then , to obey what was written , they celebrated the Feast of Shelters . They offered the right number of sacrifices for each day of the festival .
NCV	Ezra	3	5	After the Feast of Shelters , they had regular sacrifices every day , as well as sacrifices for the New Moon and all the festivals commanded by the Lord . Also there were special offerings brought as gifts to the Lord .
NCV	Ezra	3	6	On the first day of the seventh month they began to bring burnt offerings to the Lord , but the foundation of the Lord ’ s Temple had not yet been laid . Rebuilding the Temple
NCV	Ezra	3	7	Then they gave money to the bricklayers and carpenters . They also gave food , wine , and oil to the cities of Sidon and Tyre so they would float cedar logs from Lebanon to the seacoast town of Joppa . Cyrus king of Persia had given permission for this .
NCV	Ezra	3	8	In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the Temple of God in Jerusalem , Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , Jeshua son of Jozadak , their fellow priests and Levites , and all who had returned from captivity to Jerusalem began to work . They chose Levites twenty years old and older to be in charge of the building of the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Ezra	3	9	These men were in charge of the work of building the Temple of God : Jeshua and his sons and brothers ; Kadmiel and his sons who were the descendants of Hodaviah ; and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers . They were all Levites .
NCV	Ezra	3	10	The builders finished laying the foundation of the Temple of the Lord . Then the priests , dressed in their robes , stood with their trumpets , and the Levites , the sons of Asaph , stood with their cymbals . They all took their places and praised the Lord just as David king of Israel had said to do .
NCV	Ezra	3	11	With praise and thanksgiving , they sang to the Lord : “ He is good ; his love for Israel continues forever. ” And then all the people shouted loudly , “ Praise the Lord ! The foundation of his Temple has been laid. ”
NCV	Ezra	3	12	But many of the older priests , Levites , and family leaders who had seen the first Temple cried when they saw the foundation of this Temple . Most of the other people were shouting with joy .

NCV	Ezra	4	4	Then the people around them tried to discourage the people of Judah by making them afraid to build .
NCV	Ezra	4	2	they came to Zerubbabel and the leaders of the families . The enemies said , “ Let us help you build , because we are like you and want to worship your God . We have been offering sacrifices to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria , who brought us here. ”
NCV	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel , Jeshua , and the leaders of Israel answered , “ You will not help us build a Temple to our God . We will build it ourselves for the Lord , the God of Israel , as King Cyrus , the king of Persia , commanded us to do. ”
NCV	Ezra	4	5	Their enemies hired others to delay the building plans during the time Cyrus was king of Persia . And it continued to the time Darius was king of Persia . More Problems for the Builders
NCV	Ezra	4	6	When Xerxes first became king , those enemies wrote a letter against the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezra	4	7	When Artaxerxes became king of Persia , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and those with them wrote a letter to Artaxerxes . It was written in the Aramaic language and translated .
NCV	Ezra	4	8	Rehum the governor and Shimshai the governor ’ s secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king . It said :
NCV	Ezra	4	9	This letter is from Rehum the governor , Shimshai the secretary , and their fellow workers—the judges and important officers over the men who came from Tripolis , Persia , Erech , and Babylon , the Elamite people of Susa ,
NCV	Ezra	4	10	and those whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal forced out of their countries and settled in the city of Samaria and in other places of the Trans-Euphrates .
NCV	Ezra	4	11	( This is a copy of the letter they sent to Artaxerxes . ) To King Artaxerxes . From your servants who live in Trans-Euphrates .
NCV	Ezra	4	12	King Artaxerxes , you should know that the Jewish people who came to us from you have gone to Jerusalem to rebuild that evil city that refuses to obey . They are fixing the walls and repairing the foundations of the buildings .
NCV	Ezra	4	13	Now , King Artaxerxes , you should know that if Jerusalem is built and its walls are fixed , Jerusalem will not pay taxes of any kind . Then the amount of money your government collects will be less .
NCV	Ezra	4	14	Since we must be loyal to the government , we don ’ t want to see the king dishonored . So we are writing to let the king know .
NCV	Ezra	4	15	We suggest you search the records of the kings who ruled before you . You will find out that the city of Jerusalem refuses to obey and makes trouble for kings and areas controlled by Persia . Since long ago it has been a place where disobedience has started . That is why it was destroyed .
NCV	Ezra	4	16	We want you to know , King Artaxerxes , that if this city is rebuilt and its walls fixed , you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates .
NCV	Ezra	4	17	King Artaxerxes sent this answer : To Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary , to all their fellow workers living in Samaria , and to those in other places in Trans-Euphrates . Greetings .
NCV	Ezra	4	18	The letter you sent to us has been translated and read to me .
NCV	Ezra	4	19	I ordered the records to be searched , and it was done . We found that Jerusalem has a history of disobedience to kings and has been a place of problems and trouble .
NCV	Ezra	4	20	Jerusalem has had powerful kings who have ruled over the whole area of Trans-Euphrates , and taxes of all kinds have been paid to them .
NCV	Ezra	4	21	Now , give an order for those men to stop work . The city of Jerusalem will not be rebuilt until I say so .
NCV	Ezra	4	22	Make sure you do this , because if they continue , it will hurt the government .
NCV	Ezra	4	23	A copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes sent was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and the others . Then they quickly went to the Jewish people in Jerusalem and forced them to stop building .
NCV	Ezra	4	24	So the work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem stopped until the second year Darius was king of Persia . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ezra	4	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ezra	5	5	But their God was watching over the elders of the Jewish people . The builders were not stopped until a report could go to King Darius and his written answer could be received .
NCV	Ezra	5	2	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak started working again to rebuild the Temple of God in Jerusalem . And the prophets of God were there , helping them .
NCV	Ezra	5	3	At that time Tattenai , the governor of Trans-Euphrates , and Shethar-Bozenai , and their fellow workers went to the Jewish people and asked , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and fix these walls ? ”
NCV	Ezra	5	4	They also asked , “ What are the names of the men working on this building ? ”
NCV	Ezra	5	6	This is a copy of the letter that was sent to King Darius by Tattenai , the governor of Trans-Euphrates , Shethar-Bozenai , and the other important officers of Trans-Euphrates .
NCV	Ezra	5	7	This is what was said in the report they sent to him : To King Darius . Greetings . May you have peace .
NCV	Ezra	5	8	King Darius , you should know that we went to the district of Judah where the Temple of the great God is . The people are building that Temple with large stones , and they are putting timbers in the walls . They are working very hard and are building very fast .
NCV	Ezra	5	9	We asked their elders , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and these walls ? ”
NCV	Ezra	5	10	We also asked for their names , and we wrote down the names of their leaders so you would know who they are .
NCV	Ezra	5	11	This is the answer they gave to us : “ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth . We are rebuilding the Temple that a great king of Israel built and finished many years ago .
NCV	Ezra	5	12	But our ancestors made the God of heaven angry , so he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , who destroyed this Temple and took the people to Babylon as captives .
NCV	Ezra	5	13	“ Later , in the first year Cyrus was king of Babylon , he gave a special order for this Temple to be rebuilt .
NCV	Ezra	5	14	Cyrus brought out from the temple in Babylon the gold and silver bowls and pans that came from the Temple of God . Nebuchadnezzar had taken them from the Temple in Jerusalem and had put them in the temple in Babylon . “ Then King Cyrus gave them to Sheshbazzar , his appointed governor .
NCV	Ezra	5	15	Cyrus said to him , ‘ Take these gold and silver bowls and pans , and put them back in the Temple in Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple of God where it was. ’
NCV	Ezra	5	16	So Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem . From that day until now the work has been going on , but it is not yet finished. ”
NCV	Ezra	5	17	Now , if the king wishes , let a search be made in the royal records of Babylon . See if King Cyrus gave an order to rebuild this Temple in Jerusalem . Then let the king write us and tell us what he has decided . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ezra	5	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ezra	6	6	Now then , Tattenai , governor of Trans-Euphrates , Shethar-Bozenai , and all the officers of that area , stay away from there .
NCV	Ezra	6	2	A scroll was found in Ecbatana , the capital city of Media . This is what was written on it : Note :
NCV	Ezra	6	3	King Cyrus gave an order about the Temple of God in Jerusalem in the first year he was king . This was the order : “ Let the Temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices . Let its foundations be laid ; it should be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide .
NCV	Ezra	6	4	It must have three layers of large stones and then one layer of timbers . The costs should be paid from the king ’ s treasury .
NCV	Ezra	6	5	The gold and silver utensils from the Temple of God should be put back in their places . Nebuchadnezzar took them from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon , but they are to be put back in the Temple of God in Jerusalem. ”
NCV	Ezra	6	7	Do not bother the work on that Temple of God . Let the governor of the Jewish people and the Jewish elders rebuild this Temple where it was before .
NCV	Ezra	6	8	Also , I order you to do this for those elders of the Jewish people who are building this Temple : The cost of the building is to be fully paid from the royal treasury , from taxes collected from Trans-Euphrates . Do this so the work will not stop .
NCV	Ezra	6	9	Give those people anything they need—young bulls , male sheep , or lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven , or wheat , salt , wine , or olive oil . Give the priests in Jerusalem anything they ask for every day without fail .
NCV	Ezra	6	10	Then they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven , and they may pray for the life of the king and his sons .
NCV	Ezra	6	11	Also , I give this order : If anyone changes this order , a wood beam is to be pulled from his house and driven through his body . Because of his crime , make his house a pile of ruins .
NCV	Ezra	6	12	God has chosen Jerusalem as the place he is to be worshiped . May he punish any king or person who tries to change this order and destroy this Temple . I , Darius , have given this order . Let it be obeyed quickly and carefully . Completion of the Temple
NCV	Ezra	6	13	So , Tattenai , the governor of Trans-Euphrates , Shethar-Bozenai , and their fellow workers carried out King Darius ’ order quickly and carefully .
NCV	Ezra	6	14	The Jewish elders continued to build and were successful because of the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah , a descendant of Iddo . They finished building the Temple as the God of Israel had commanded and as kings Cyrus , Darius , and Artaxerxes of Persia had ordered .
NCV	Ezra	6	15	The Temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year Darius was king .
NCV	Ezra	6	16	Then the people of Israel celebrated and gave the Temple to God to honor him . Everybody was happy : the priests , the Levites , and the rest of the Jewish people who had returned from captivity .
NCV	Ezra	6	17	They gave the Temple to God by offering a hundred bulls , two hundred male sheep , and four hundred lambs as sacrifices . And as an offering to forgive the sins of all Israel , they offered twelve male goats , one goat for each tribe in Israel .
NCV	Ezra	6	18	Then they put the priests and the Levites into their separate groups . Each group had a certain time to serve God in the Temple at Jerusalem as it is written in the Book of Moses . The Passover Is Celebrated
NCV	Ezra	6	19	The Jewish people who returned from captivity celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month .
NCV	Ezra	6	20	The priests and Levites had made themselves clean . Then the Levites killed the Passover lambs for all the people who had returned from captivity , for their relatives the priests , and for themselves .
NCV	Ezra	6	21	So all the people of Israel who returned from captivity ate the Passover lamb . So did the people who had given up the unclean ways of their non-Jewish neighbors in order to worship the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	Ezra	6	22	For seven days they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread in a very joyful way . The Lord had made them happy by changing the mind of the king of Assyria so that he helped them in the work on the Temple of the God of Israel . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezra	7	20	which we have given you . Use the royal treasury to pay for anything else you need for the Temple of your God .
NCV	Ezra	7	21	Now I , King Artaxerxes , give this order to all the men in charge of the treasury of Trans-Euphrates : Give Ezra , a priest and a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven , whatever he asks for .
NCV	Ezra	7	22	Give him up to seventy-five hundred pounds of silver , six hundred bushels of wheat , six hundred gallons of wine , and six hundred gallons of olive oil . And give him as much salt as he wants .
NCV	Ezra	7	23	Carefully give him whatever the God of heaven wants for the Temple of the God of heaven . We do not want God to be angry with the king and his sons .
NCV	Ezra	7	24	Remember , you must not make these people pay taxes of any kind : priests , Levites , singers , gatekeepers , Temple servants , and other workers in this Temple of God .
NCV	Ezra	7	25	And you , Ezra , use the wisdom you have from your God to choose judges and lawmakers to rule the Jewish people of Trans-Euphrates . They know the laws of your God , and you may teach anyone who does not know them .
NCV	Ezra	7	26	Whoever does not obey the law of your God or of the king must be punished . He will be killed , or sent away , or have his property taken away , or be put in jail .
NCV	Ezra	7	27	Praise the Lord , the God of our ancestors . He caused the king to want to honor the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezra	7	28	The Lord has shown me , Ezra , his love in the presence of the king , those who advise the king , and the royal officers . Because the Lord my God was helping me , I had courage , and I gathered the leaders of Israel to return with me .

NCV	Ezra	8	14	From the descendants of Bigvai : Uthai and Zaccur , with seventy men . The Return to Jerusalem
NCV	Ezra	8	15	I called all those people together at the canal that flows toward Ahava , where we camped for three days . I checked all the people and the priests , but I did not find any Levites .
NCV	Ezra	8	16	So I called these leaders : Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and Meshullam . And I called Joiarib and Elnathan , who were teachers .
NCV	Ezra	8	17	I sent these men to Iddo , the leader at Casiphia , and told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives , who are the Temple servants in Casiphia . I sent them to bring servants to us for the Temple of our God .
NCV	Ezra	8	18	Our God was helping us , so Iddo ’ s relatives gave us Sherebiah , a wise man from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi , who was the son of Israel . And they brought Sherebiah ’ s sons and brothers , for a total of eighteen men .
NCV	Ezra	8	19	And they brought to us Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari , and his brothers and nephews . In all there were twenty men .
NCV	Ezra	8	20	They also brought two hundred twenty of the Temple servants , a group David and the officers had set up to help the Levites . All of those men were listed by name .
NCV	Ezra	8	21	There by the Ahava Canal , I announced we would all fast and deny ourselves before our God . We would ask God for a safe trip for ourselves , our children , and all our possessions .
NCV	Ezra	8	22	I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road . We had said to the king , “ Our God helps everyone who obeys him , but he is very angry with all who reject him. ”
NCV	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and prayed to our God about our trip , and he answered our prayers .
NCV	Ezra	8	24	Then I chose twelve of the priests who were leaders , Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their relatives .
NCV	Ezra	8	25	I weighed the offering of silver and gold and the utensils given for the Temple of our God , and I gave them to the twelve priests I had chosen . The king , the people who advised him , his officers , and all the Israelites there with us had given these things for the Temple .
NCV	Ezra	8	26	I weighed out and gave them about fifty thousand pounds of silver , about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver objects , and about seventy-five hundred pounds of gold .
NCV	Ezra	8	27	I gave them twenty gold bowls that weighed about nineteen pounds and two fine pieces of polished bronze that were as valuable as gold .
NCV	Ezra	8	28	Then I said to the priests , “ You and these utensils belong to the Lord for his service . The silver and gold are gifts to the Lord , the God of your ancestors .
NCV	Ezra	8	29	Guard these things carefully . In Jerusalem , weigh them in front of the leading priests , Levites , and the leaders of the family groups of Israel in the rooms of the Temple of the Lord. ”
NCV	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and Levites accepted the silver , the gold , and the utensils that had been weighed to take them to the Temple of our God in Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezra	8	31	On the twelfth day of the first month we left the Ahava Canal and started toward Jerusalem . Our God helped us and protected us from enemies and robbers along the way .
NCV	Ezra	8	32	Finally we arrived in Jerusalem where we rested three days .
NCV	Ezra	8	33	On the fourth day we weighed out the silver , the gold , and the utensils in the Temple of our God . We handed them to the priest Meremoth son of Uriah . Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him , as were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui .
NCV	Ezra	8	34	We checked everything by number and by weight , and the total weight was written down .
NCV	Ezra	8	35	Then the captives who returned made burnt offerings to the God of Israel . They sacrificed twelve bulls for all Israel , ninety-six male sheep , and seventy-seven lambs . For a sin offering there were twelve male goats . All this was a burnt offering to the Lord .
NCV	Ezra	8	36	They took King Artaxerxes ’ orders to the royal officers and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates . Then these men gave help to the people and the Temple of God . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezra	9	9	Even though we are slaves , our God has not left us . He caused the kings of Persia to be kind to us and has given us new life . We can rebuild the Temple and repair its ruins . And he has given us a wall to protect us in Judah and Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezra	9	2	The Israelite men and their sons have married these women . They have mixed the people who belong to God with the people around them . The leaders and officers of Israel have led the rest of the Israelites to do this unfaithful thing. ”
NCV	Ezra	9	3	When I heard this , I angrily tore my robe and coat , pulled hair from my head and beard , and sat down in shock .
NCV	Ezra	9	4	Everyone who trembled in fear at the word of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the captives who had returned . I sat there in shock until the evening sacrifice .
NCV	Ezra	9	5	At the evening sacrifice I got up from where I had shown my shame . My robe and coat were torn , and I fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God .
NCV	Ezra	9	6	I prayed , “ My God , I am too ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to you , my God , because our sins are so many . They are higher than our heads . Our guilt even reaches up to the sky .
NCV	Ezra	9	7	From the days of our ancestors until now , our guilt has been great . Because of our sins , we , our kings , and our priests have been punished by the sword and captivity . Foreign kings have taken away our things and shamed us , even as it is today .
NCV	Ezra	9	8	“ But now , for a short time , the Lord our God has been kind to us . He has let some of us come back from captivity and has let us live in safety in his holy place . And so our God gives us hope and a little relief from our slavery .
NCV	Ezra	9	10	“ But now , our God , what can we say after you have done all this ? We have disobeyed your commands
NCV	Ezra	9	11	that you gave through your servants the prophets . You said , ‘ The land you are entering to own is ruined ; the people living there have spoiled it by the evil they do . Their evil filled the land with uncleanness from one end to the other .
NCV	Ezra	9	12	So do not let your daughters marry their sons , and do not let their daughters marry your sons . Do not wish for their peace or success . Then you will be strong and eat the good things of the land . Then you can leave this land to your descendants forever. ’
NCV	Ezra	9	13	“ What has happened to us is our own fault . We have done evil things , and our guilt is great . But you , our God , have punished us less than we deserve ; you have left a few of us alive .
NCV	Ezra	9	14	We should not again break your commands by allowing marriages with these wicked people . If we did , you would get angry enough to destroy us , and none of us would be left alive .
NCV	Ezra	9	15	Lord , God of Israel , by your goodness a few of us are left alive today . We admit that we are guilty and none of us should be allowed to stand before you. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezra	10	10	Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , “ You have been unfaithful and have married non-Jewish women . You have made Israel more guilty .
NCV	Ezra	10	2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel the Elamite said to Ezra , “ We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying women from the peoples around us . But even so , there is still hope for Israel .
NCV	Ezra	10	3	Now let us make an agreement before our God . We will send away all these women and their children as you and those who respect the commands of our God advise . Let it be done to obey God ’ s Teachings .
NCV	Ezra	10	4	Get up , Ezra . You are in charge , and we will support you . Have courage and do it. ”
NCV	Ezra	10	5	So Ezra got up and made the priests , Levites , and all the people of Israel promise to do what was suggested ; and they promised .
NCV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra left the Temple and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib . While Ezra was there , he did not eat or drink , because he was still sad about the unfaithfulness of the captives who had returned .
NCV	Ezra	10	7	They sent an order in Judah and Jerusalem for all the captives who had returned to meet together in Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezra	10	8	Whoever did not come to Jerusalem within three days would lose his property and would no longer be a member of the community of the returned captives . That was the decision of the officers and elders .
NCV	Ezra	10	9	So within three days all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem . It was the twentieth day of the ninth month . All the men were sitting in the open place in front of the Temple and were upset because of the meeting and because it was raining .
NCV	Ezra	10	11	Now , confess it to the Lord , the God of your ancestors . Do his will and separate yourselves from the people living around you and from your non-Jewish wives. ”
NCV	Ezra	10	12	Then the whole group answered Ezra with a loud voice , “ Ezra , you ’ re right ! We must do what you say .
NCV	Ezra	10	13	But there are many people here , and it ’ s the rainy season . We can ’ t stand outside , and this problem can ’ t be solved in a day or two , because we have sinned badly .
NCV	Ezra	10	14	Let our officers make a decision for the whole group . Then let everyone in our towns who has married a non-Jewish woman meet with the elders and judges of each town at a planned time , until the hot anger of our God turns away from us. ”
NCV	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel , Jahzeiah son of Tikvah , Meshullam , and Shabbethai the Levite were against the plan .
NCV	Ezra	10	16	So the returned captives did what was suggested . Ezra the priest chose men who were leaders of the family groups and named one from each family division . On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to study each case .
NCV	Ezra	10	17	By the first day of the first month , they had finished with all the men who had married non-Jewish women . Those Guilty of Marrying Non-Jewish Women

NCV	Nehemiah	1	1	These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah . In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year , [ a ] I , Nehemiah , was in the capital city of Susa .
NCV	Nehemiah	1	2	One of my brothers named Hanani came with some other men from Judah . I asked them about Jerusalem and the Jewish people who lived through the captivity .
NCV	Nehemiah	1	3	They answered me , “ Those who are left from the captivity are back in Judah , but they are in much trouble and are full of shame . The wall around Jerusalem is broken down , and its gates have been burned. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	1	4	When I heard these things , I sat down and cried for several days . I was sad and fasted . I prayed to the God of heaven ,
NCV	Nehemiah	1	5	“ Lord , God of heaven , you are the great God who is to be respected . You are loyal , and you keep your agreement with those who love you and obey your commands .
NCV	Nehemiah	1	6	Look and listen carefully . Hear the prayer that I , your servant , am praying to you day and night for your servants , the Israelites . I confess the sins we Israelites have done against you . My father ’ s family and I have sinned against you .
NCV	Nehemiah	1	7	We have been wicked toward you and have not obeyed the commands , rules , and laws you gave your servant Moses .
NCV	Nehemiah	1	8	“ Remember what you taught your servant Moses , saying , ‘ If you are unfaithful , I will scatter you among the nations .

NCV	Nehemiah	2	2	So the king said , “ Why does your face look sad even though you are not sick ? Your heart must be sad. ” Then I was very afraid .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	3	I said to the king , “ May the king live forever ! My face is sad because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins , and its gates have been destroyed by fire. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	2	4	Then the king said to me , “ What do you want ? ” First I prayed to the God of heaven .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	5	Then I answered the king , “ If you are willing and if I have pleased you , send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so I can rebuild it. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	2	6	The queen was sitting next to the king . He asked me , “ How long will your trip take , and when will you get back ? ” It pleased the king to send me , so I set a time .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	7	I also said to him , “ If you are willing , give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates . Tell them to let me pass safely through their lands on my way to Judah .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	8	And may I have a letter for Asaph , the keeper of the king ’ s forest , telling him to give me timber ? I will need it to make boards for the gates of the palace , which is by the Temple , and for the city wall , and for the house in which I will live. ” So the king gave me the letters , because God was showing kindness to me .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	9	Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king ’ s letters . The king had also sent army officers and soldiers on horses with me .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite officer heard about this , they were upset that someone had come to help the Israelites . Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem
NCV	Nehemiah	2	11	I went to Jerusalem and stayed there three days .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	12	Then at night I started out with a few men . I had not told anyone what God had caused me to do for Jerusalem . There were no animals with me except the one I was riding .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	13	I went out at night through the Valley Gate . I rode toward the Dragon Well and the Trash Gate , inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been destroyed by fire .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King ’ s Pool , but there was not enough room for the animal I was riding to pass through .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	15	So I went up the valley at night , inspecting the wall . Finally , I turned and went back in through the Valley Gate .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	16	The guards did not know where I had gone or what I was doing . I had not yet said anything to the Jewish people , the priests , the important men , the officers , or any of the others who would do the work .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	17	Then I said to them , “ You can see the trouble we have here . Jerusalem is a pile of ruins , and its gates have been burned . Come , let ’ s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so we won ’ t be full of shame any longer. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	2	18	I also told them how God had been kind to me and what the king had said to me . Then they answered , “ Let ’ s start rebuilding. ” So they began to work hard .
NCV	Nehemiah	2	19	But when Sanballat the Horonite , Tobiah the Ammonite officer , and Geshem the Arab heard about it , they made fun of us and laughed at us . They said , “ What are you doing ? Are you turning against the king ? ”
NCV	Nehemiah	2	20	But I answered them , “ The God of heaven will give us success . We , his servants , will start rebuilding , but you have no share , claim , or memorial in Jerusalem. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Nehemiah	4	5	Do not hide their guilt or take away their sins so that you can ’ t see them , because they have insulted the builders. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	6	So we rebuilt the wall to half its height , because the people were willing to work .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	7	But Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites , and the people from Ashdod were very angry when they heard that the repairs to Jerusalem ’ s walls were continuing and that the holes in the wall were being closed .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	8	So they all made plans to come to Jerusalem and fight and stir up trouble .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	9	But we prayed to our God and appointed guards to watch for them day and night .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	10	The people of Judah said , “ The workers are getting tired . There is so much trash we can not rebuild the wall. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	11	And our enemies said , “ The Jews won ’ t know or see anything until we come among them and kill them and stop the work. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	12	Then the Jewish people who lived near our enemies came and told us ten times , “ Everywhere you turn , the enemy will attack us. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	13	So I put people behind the lowest places along the wall—the open places—and I put families together with their swords , spears , and bows .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	14	Then I looked around and stood up and said to the important men , the leaders , and the rest of the people : “ Don ’ t be afraid of them . Remember the Lord , who is great and powerful . Fight for your brothers , your sons and daughters , your wives , and your homes. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	15	Then our enemies heard that we knew about their plans and that God had ruined their plans . So we all went back to the wall , each to his own work .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	16	From that day on , half my people worked on the wall . The other half was ready with spears , shields , bows , and armor . The officers stood in back of the people of Judah
NCV	Nehemiah	4	17	who were building the wall . Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and carried a weapon with the other .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	18	Each builder wore his sword at his side as he worked . The man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	19	Then I said to the important people , the leaders , and everyone else , “ This is a very big job . We are spreading out along the wall so that we are far apart .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet , assemble there . Our God will fight for us. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	21	So we continued to work with half the men holding spears from sunrise till the stars came out .
NCV	Nehemiah	4	22	At that time I also said to the people , “ Let every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night . They can be our guards at night and workmen during the day. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	4	23	Neither I , my brothers , my workers , nor the guards with me ever took off our clothes . Each person carried his weapon even when he went for water . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Nehemiah	5	5	We are just like our fellow Jews , and our sons are like their sons . But we have to sell our sons and daughters as slaves . Some of our daughters have already been sold . But there is nothing we can do , because our fields and vineyards already belong to other people. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	5	2	Some of them were saying , “ We have many sons and daughters in our families . To eat and stay alive , we need grain. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	5	3	Others were saying , “ We are borrowing money against our fields , vineyards , and homes to get grain because there is not much food. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	5	4	And still others were saying , “ We are borrowing money to pay the king ’ s tax on our fields and vineyards .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	6	When I heard their complaints about these things , I was very angry .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	7	After I thought about it , I accused the important people and the leaders , “ You are charging your own brothers too much interest. ” So I called a large meeting to deal with them .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	8	I said to them , “ As much as possible , we have bought freedom for our fellow Jews who had been sold to foreigners . Now you are selling your fellow Jews to us ! ” The leaders were quiet and had nothing to say .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	9	Then I said , “ What you are doing is not right . Don ’ t you fear God ? Don ’ t let our foreign enemies shame us .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	10	I , my brothers , and my men are also lending money and grain to the people . But stop charging them so much for this .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	11	Give back their fields , vineyards , olive trees , and houses right now . Also give back the extra amount you charged—the hundredth part of the money , grain , new wine , and oil. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	5	12	They said , “ We will give it back and not demand anything more from them . We will do as you say. ” Then I called for the priests , and I made the important people and leaders take an oath to do what they had said .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	13	Also I shook out the folds of my robe and said , “ In this way may God shake out everyone who does not keep his promise . May God shake him out of his house and out of the things that are his . Let that person be shaken out and emptied ! ” Then the whole group said , “ Amen , ” and they praised the Lord . So the people did what they had promised .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	14	I was appointed governor in the land of Judah in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes ’ rule . I was governor of Judah for twelve years , until his thirty-second year . During that time neither my brothers nor I ate the food that was allowed for a governor .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	15	But the governors before me had placed a heavy load on the people . They took about one pound of silver from each person , along with food and wine . The governors ’ helpers before me also controlled the people , but I did not do that , because I feared God .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	16	I worked on the wall , as did all my men who were gathered there . We did not buy any fields .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	17	Also , I fed one hundred fifty Jewish people and officers at my table , as well as those who came from the nations around us .
NCV	Nehemiah	5	18	This is what was prepared every day : one ox , six good sheep , and birds . And every ten days there were all kinds of wine . But I never demanded the food that was due a governor , because the people were already working very hard .

NCV	Nehemiah	6	6	This is what was written : A report is going around to all the nations , and Geshem says it is true , that you and the Jewish people are planning to turn against the king and that you are rebuilding the wall . They say you are going to be their king
NCV	Nehemiah	6	2	So Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message : “ Come , Nehemiah , let ’ s meet together in Kephirim on the plain of Ono. ” But they were planning to harm me .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	3	So I sent messengers to them with this answer : “ I am doing a great work , and I can ’ t come down . I don ’ t want the work to stop while I leave to meet you. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	6	4	Sanballat and Geshem sent the same message to me four times , and each time I sent back the same answer .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	5	The fifth time Sanballat sent his helper to me with the message , and in his hand was an unsealed letter .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	7	and that you have appointed prophets to announce in Jerusalem : “ There is a king of Judah ! ” The king will hear about this . So come , let ’ s discuss this together .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	8	So I sent him back this answer : “ Nothing you are saying is really happening . You are just making it up in your own mind. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	6	9	Our enemies were trying to scare us , thinking , “ They will get too weak to work . Then the wall will not be finished. ” But I prayed , “ God , make me strong. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	6	10	One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah , the son of Mehetabel . Shemaiah had to stay at home . He said , “ Nehemiah , let ’ s meet in the Temple of God . Let ’ s go inside the Temple and close the doors , because men are coming at night to kill you. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	6	11	But I said , “ Should a man like me run away ? Should I run for my life into the Temple ? I will not go. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	6	12	I knew that God had not sent him but that Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to prophesy against me .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	13	They paid him to frighten me so I would do this and sin . Then they could give me a bad name to shame me .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	14	I prayed , “ My God , remember Tobiah and Sanballat and what they have done . Also remember the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who have been trying to frighten me. ” The Wall Is Finished
NCV	Nehemiah	6	15	The wall of Jerusalem was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul . It took fifty-two days to rebuild .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	16	When all our enemies heard about it and all the nations around us saw it , they were shamed . They then understood that the work had been done with the help of our God .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	17	Also in those days the important people of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah , and he answered them .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	18	Many Jewish people had promised to be faithful to Tobiah , because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah . And Tobiah ’ s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah .
NCV	Nehemiah	6	19	These important people kept telling me about the good things Tobiah was doing , and then they would tell Tobiah what I said about him . So Tobiah sent letters to frighten me . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Nehemiah	7	2	I put my brother Hanani , along with Hananiah , the commander of the palace , in charge of Jerusalem . Hananiah was honest and feared God more than most people .
NCV	Nehemiah	7	3	I said to them , “ The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the sun is hot . While the gatekeepers are still on duty , have them shut and bolt the doors . Appoint people who live in Jerusalem as guards , and put some at guard posts and some near their own houses. ” The Captives Who Returned
NCV	Nehemiah	7	4	The city was large and roomy , but there were few people in it , and the houses had not yet been rebuilt .

NCV	Nehemiah	8	8	They read from the Book of the Teachings of God and explained what it meant so the people understood what was being read .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	2	So on the first day of the seventh month , Ezra the priest brought out the Teachings for the crowd . Men , women , and all who could listen and understand had gathered .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	3	At the square by the Water Gate Ezra read the Teachings out loud from early morning until noon to the men , women , and everyone who could listen and understand . All the people listened carefully to the Book of the Teachings .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	4	Ezra the teacher stood on a high wooden platform that had been built just for this time . On his right were Mattithiah , Shema , Anaiah , Uriah , Hilkiah , and Maaseiah . And on his left were Pedaiah , Mishael , Malkijah , Hashum , Hashbaddanah , Zechariah , and Meshullam .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	5	Ezra opened the book in full view of everyone , because he was above them . As he opened it , all the people stood up .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	6	Ezra praised the Lord , the great God , and all the people held up their hands and said , “ Amen ! Amen ! ” Then they bowed down and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	7	These Levites explained the Teachings to the people as they stood there : Jeshua , Bani , Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , and Pelaiah .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	9	Then Nehemiah the governor , Ezra the priest and teacher , and the Levites who were teaching said to all the people , “ This is a holy day to the Lord your God . Don ’ t be sad or cry. ” All the people had been crying as they listened to the words of the Teachings .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	10	Nehemiah said , “ Go and enjoy good food and sweet drinks . Send some to people who have none , because today is a holy day to the Lord . Don ’ t be sad , because the joy of the Lord will make you strong. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	8	11	The Levites helped calm the people , saying , “ Be quiet , because this is a holy day . Don ’ t be sad. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	8	12	Then all the people went away to eat and drink , to send some of their food to others , and to celebrate with great joy . They finally understood what they had been taught .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	13	On the second day of the month , the leaders of all the families , the priests , and the Levites met with Ezra the teacher . They gathered to study the words of the Teachings .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	14	This is what they found written in the Teachings : The Lord commanded through Moses that the people of Israel were to live in shelters during the feast of the seventh month .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	15	The people were supposed to preach this message and spread it through all their towns and in Jerusalem : “ Go out into the mountains , and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees , myrtle trees , palms , and shade trees . Make shelters with them , as it is written. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	8	16	So the people went out and got tree branches . They built shelters on their roofs , [ a ] in their courtyards , in the courtyards of the Temple , in the square by the Water Gate , and in the square next to the Gate of Ephraim .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	17	The whole group that had come back from captivity built shelters and lived in them . The Israelites had not done this since the time of Joshua son of Nun . And they were very happy .
NCV	Nehemiah	8	18	Ezra read to them every day from the Book of the Teachings , from the first day to the last . The people of Israel celebrated the feast for seven days , and then on the eighth day the people gathered as the law said . Footnotes - 8:16 roofs In Bible times houses were built with flat roofs . The roof was used for drying things such as flax and fruit . And it was used as an extra room , as a place for worship , and as a cool place to sleep in the summer .

NCV	Nehemiah	9	9	“ You saw our ancestors suffering in Egypt and heard them cry out at the Red Sea .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	2	Those people whose ancestors were from Israel had separated themselves from all foreigners . They stood and confessed their sins and their ancestors ’ sins .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	3	For a fourth of the day they stood where they were and read from the Book of the Teachings of the Lord their God . For another fourth of the day they confessed their sins and worshiped the Lord their God .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	4	These Levites were standing on the stairs : Jeshua , Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Kenani . They called out to the Lord their God with loud voices .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	5	Then these Levites spoke : Jeshua , Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabneiah , Sherebiah , Hodiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah . They said , “ Stand up and praise the Lord your God , who lives forever and ever. ” The People ’ s Prayer “ Blessed be your wonderful name . It is more wonderful than all blessing and praise .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	6	You are the only Lord . You made the heavens , even the highest heavens , with all the stars . You made the earth and everything on it , the seas and everything in them ; you give life to everything . The heavenly army worships you .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	7	“ You are the Lord , the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur in Babylonia and named him Abraham .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	8	You found him faithful to you , so you made an agreement with him to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Jebusites , and Girgashites . You have kept your promise , because you do what is right .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	10	You did signs and miracles against the king of Egypt , and against all his officers and all his people , because you knew how proud they were . You became as famous as you are today .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	11	You divided the sea in front of our ancestors ; they walked through on dry ground . But you threw the people chasing them into the deep water , like a stone thrown into mighty waters .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	12	You led our ancestors with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire at night . It lit the way they were supposed to go .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	13	You came down to Mount Sinai and spoke from heaven to our ancestors . You gave them fair rules and true teachings , good orders and commands .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	14	You told them about your holy Sabbath and gave them commands , orders , and teachings through your servant Moses .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	15	When they were hungry , you gave them bread from heaven . When they were thirsty , you brought them water from the rock . You told them to enter and take over the land you had promised to give them .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	16	“ But our ancestors were proud and stubborn and did not obey your commands .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	17	They refused to listen ; they forgot the miracles you did for them . So they became stubborn and turned against you , choosing a leader to take them back to slavery . But you are a forgiving God . You are kind and full of mercy . You do not become angry quickly , and you have great love . So you did not leave them .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	18	Our ancestors even made an idol of a calf for themselves . They said , ‘ This is your god , Israel , who brought you up out of Egypt. ’ They spoke against you .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	19	“ You have great mercy , so you did not leave them in the desert . The pillar of cloud guided them by day , and the pillar of fire led them at night , lighting the way they were to go .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	20	You gave your good Spirit to teach them . You gave them manna to eat and water when they were thirsty .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	21	You took care of them for forty years in the desert ; they needed nothing . Their clothes did not wear out , and their feet did not swell .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	22	“ You gave them kingdoms and nations ; you gave them more land . They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	23	You made their children as many as the stars in the sky , and you brought them into the land that you told their ancestors to enter and take over .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	24	So their children went into the land and took over . The Canaanites lived there , but you defeated them for our ancestors . You handed over to them the Canaanites , their kings , and the people of the land . Our ancestors could do what they wanted with them .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	25	They captured strong , walled cities and fertile land . They took over houses full of good things , wells that were already dug , vineyards , olive trees , and many fruit trees . They ate until they were full and grew fat ; they enjoyed your great goodness .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	26	“ But they were disobedient and turned against you and ignored your teachings . Your prophets warned them to come back to you , but they killed those prophets and spoke against you .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	27	So you handed them over to their enemies , and their enemies treated them badly . But in this time of trouble our ancestors cried out to you , and you heard from heaven . You had great mercy and gave them saviors who saved them from the power of their enemies .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	28	But as soon as they had rest , they again did what was evil . So you left them to their enemies who ruled over them . When they cried out to you again , you heard from heaven . Because of your mercy , you saved them again and again .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	29	You warned them to return to your teachings , but they were proud and did not obey your commands . If someone obeys your laws , he will live , but they sinned against your laws . They were stubborn , unwilling , and disobedient .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	30	You were patient with them for many years and warned them by your Spirit through the prophets , but they did not pay attention . So you handed them over to other countries .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	31	But because your mercy is great , you did not kill them all or leave them . You are a kind and merciful God .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	32	“ And so , our God , you are the great and mighty and wonderful God . You keep your agreement of love . Do not let all our trouble seem unimportant to you . This trouble has come to us , to our kings and our leaders , to our priests and prophets , to our ancestors and all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until today .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	33	You have been fair in everything that has happened to us ; you have been loyal , but we have been wicked .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings , leaders , priests , and ancestors did not obey your teachings ; they did not pay attention to the commands and warnings you gave them .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	35	Even when our ancestors were living in their kingdom , enjoying all the good things you had given them , enjoying the land that was fertile and full of room , they did not stop their evil ways .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	36	“ Look , we are slaves today in the land you gave our ancestors . They were to enjoy its fruit and its good things , but look , we are slaves here .
NCV	Nehemiah	9	37	The land ’ s great harvest belongs to the kings you have put over us because of our sins . Those kings rule over us and our cattle as they please , so we are in much trouble . The People ’ s Agreement

NCV	Nehemiah	10	29	They joined their fellow Israelites and their leading men in taking an oath , which was tied to a curse in case they broke the oath . They promised to follow the Teachings of God , which they had been given through Moses the servant of God , and to obey all the commands , rules , and laws of the Lord our God .

NCV	Nehemiah	10	33	It is for the bread that is set out on the table ; the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings ; the offerings on the Sabbaths , New Moon festivals , and special feasts ; the holy offerings ; the offerings to remove the sins of the Israelites so they will belong to God ; and for the work of the Temple of our God .
NCV	Nehemiah	10	34	We , the priests , the Levites , and the people , have thrown lots to decide at what time of year each family must bring wood to the Temple . The wood is for burning on the altar of the Lord our God , and we will do this as it is written in the Teachings .
NCV	Nehemiah	10	35	We also will bring the firstfruits from our crops and the firstfruits of every tree to the Temple each year .

NCV	Nehemiah	10	37	We will bring to the priests at the storerooms of the Temple the first of our ground meal , our offerings , the fruit from all our trees , and our new wine and oil .

NCV	Nehemiah	12	24	The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah , Sherebiah , Jeshua son of Kadmiel , and their relatives . Their relatives stood across from them and gave praise and thanksgiving to God . One group answered the other group , as David , the man of God , had commanded .
NCV	Nehemiah	12	25	These were the gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms next to the gates : Mattaniah , Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , and Akkub .
NCV	Nehemiah	12	26	They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua , the son of Jozadak . They also served in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and teacher . The Wall of Jerusalem
NCV	Nehemiah	12	27	When the wall of Jerusalem was offered as a gift to God , they asked the Levites to come from wherever they lived to Jerusalem to celebrate with joy the gift of the wall . They were to celebrate with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals , harps , and lyres .
NCV	Nehemiah	12	28	They also brought together singers from all around Jerusalem , from the Netophathite villages ,
NCV	Nehemiah	12	29	from Beth Gilgal , and from the areas of Geba and Azmaveth . The singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem .
NCV	Nehemiah	12	30	The priests and Levites made themselves pure , and they also made the people , the gates , and the wall of Jerusalem pure .
NCV	Nehemiah	12	31	I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall , and I appointed two large choruses to give thanks . One chorus went to the right on top of the wall , toward the Trash Gate .

NCV	Nehemiah	12	44	At that time the leaders appointed men to be in charge of the storerooms . These rooms were for the gifts , the firstfruits , and the ten percent that the people brought . The Teachings said they should bring a share for the priests and Levites from the fields around the towns . The people of Judah were happy to do this for the priests and Levites who served .
NCV	Nehemiah	12	45	They performed the service of their God in making things pure . The singers and gatekeepers also did their jobs , as David had commanded his son Solomon .

NCV	Nehemiah	13	13	I put these men in charge of the storerooms : Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the teacher , and Pedaiah a Levite . I made Hanan son of Zaccur , the son of Mattaniah , their helper . Everyone knew they were honest . They gave out the portions that went to their relatives .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	2	The Ammonites and Moabites had not welcomed the Israelites with food and water . Instead , they had hired Balaam to put a curse on Israel . ( But our God turned the curse into a blessing . )
NCV	Nehemiah	13	3	When the people heard this teaching , they separated all foreigners from Israel . Nehemiah Returns to Jerusalem
NCV	Nehemiah	13	4	Before that happened , Eliashib the priest , who was in charge of the Temple storerooms , was friendly with Tobiah .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	5	Eliashib let Tobiah use one of the large storerooms . Earlier it had been used for grain offerings , incense , the utensils , and the tenth offerings of grain , new wine , and olive oil that belonged to the Levites , singers , and gatekeepers . It had also been used for gifts for the priests .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	6	I was not in Jerusalem when this happened . I had gone back to Artaxerxes king of Babylon in the thirty-second year he was king . Finally I asked the king to let me leave .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	7	When I returned to Jerusalem , I found out the evil Eliashib had done by letting Tobiah have a room in the Temple courtyard .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	8	I was very upset at this , so I threw all of Tobiah ’ s goods out of the room .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	9	I ordered the rooms to be purified , and I brought back the utensils for God ’ s Temple , the grain offerings , and the incense .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	10	Then I found out the people were not giving the Levites their shares . So the Levites and singers who served had gone back to their own farms .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	11	I argued with the officers , saying , “ Why haven ’ t you taken care of the Temple ? ” Then I gathered the Levites and singers and put them back at their places .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	12	All the people of Judah then brought to the storerooms a tenth of their crops , new wine , and olive oil .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me , my God , for this . Do not ignore my love for the Temple and its service .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw people in Judah working in the winepresses on the Sabbath day . They were bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys . And they were bringing loads of wine , grapes , and figs into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . So I warned them about selling food on that day .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	16	People from the city of Tyre who were living in Jerusalem brought in fish and other things and sold them there on the Sabbath day to the people of Judah .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	17	I argued with the important men of Judah and said to them , “ What is this evil thing you are doing ? You are ruining the Sabbath day .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	18	This is just what your ancestors did . So our God did terrible things to us and this city . Now you are making him even more angry at Israel by ruining the Sabbath day. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	13	19	So I ordered that the doors be shut at sunset before the Sabbath and not be opened until the Sabbath was over . I put my servants at the gates so no load could come in on the Sabbath .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	20	Once or twice traders and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	21	So I warned them , “ Why are you spending the night by the wall ? If you do it again , I will force you away. ” After that , they did not come back on the Sabbath .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	22	Then I ordered the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the city gates to make sure the Sabbath remained holy . Remember me , my God , for this . Have mercy on me because of your great love .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod , Ammon , and Moab .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	24	Half their children were speaking the language of Ashdod or some other place , and they couldn ’ t speak the language of Judah .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	25	I argued with those people , put curses on them , hit some of them , and pulled out their hair . I forced them to make a promise to God , saying , “ Do not let your daughters marry the sons of foreigners , and do not take the daughters of foreigners as wives for your sons or yourselves .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	26	Foreign women made King Solomon of Israel sin . There was never a king like him in any of the nations . God loved Solomon and made him king over all Israel , but foreign women made him sin .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	27	And now you are not obedient when you do this evil thing . You are unfaithful to our God when you marry foreign wives. ”
NCV	Nehemiah	13	28	Joiada was the son of Eliashib the high priest . One of Joiada ’ s sons married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite , so I sent him away from me .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them , my God , because they made the priesthood unclean and the agreement of the priests and Levites unclean .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	30	So I purified them of everything that was foreign . I appointed duties for the priests and Levites , giving each man his own job .
NCV	Nehemiah	13	31	I also made sure wood was brought for the altar at regular times and that the firstfruits were brought . Remember me , my God ; be kind to me . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Esther	1	1	This is what happened during the time of King Xerxes , the king who ruled the one hundred twenty-seven states from India to Cush .
NCV	Esther	1	2	In those days King Xerxes ruled from his capital city of Susa .
NCV	Esther	1	3	In the third year of his rule , he gave a banquet for all his important men and royal officers . The army leaders from the countries of Persia and Media and the important men from all Xerxes ’ empire were there .
NCV	Esther	1	4	The banquet lasted one hundred eighty days . All during that time King Xerxes was showing off the great wealth of his kingdom and his own great riches and glory .
NCV	Esther	1	5	When the one hundred eighty days were over , the king gave another banquet . It was held in the courtyard of the palace garden for seven days , and it was for everybody in the palace at Susa , from the greatest to the least .
NCV	Esther	1	6	The courtyard had fine white curtains and purple drapes that were tied to silver rings on marble pillars by white and purple cords . And there were gold and silver couches on a floor set with tiles of white marble , shells , and gems .
NCV	Esther	1	7	Wine was served in gold cups of various kinds . And there was plenty of the king ’ s wine , because he was very generous .
NCV	Esther	1	8	The king commanded that the guests be permitted to drink as much as they wished . He told the wine servers to serve each man what he wanted .
NCV	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes .
NCV	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day of the banquet , King Xerxes was very happy , because he had been drinking much wine . He gave a command to the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas .
NCV	Esther	1	11	He commanded them to bring him Queen Vashti , wearing her royal crown . She was to come to show her beauty to the people and important men , because she was very beautiful .
NCV	Esther	1	12	The eunuchs told Queen Vashti about the king ’ s command , but she refused to come . Then the king became very angry ; his anger was like a burning fire .
NCV	Esther	1	13	It was a custom for the king to ask advice from experts about law and order . So King Xerxes spoke with the wise men who would know the right thing to do .
NCV	Esther	1	14	The wise men the king usually talked to were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan , seven of the important men of Persia and Media . These seven had special privileges to see the king and had the highest rank in the kingdom .
NCV	Esther	1	15	The king asked them , “ What does the law say must be done to Queen Vashti ? She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes , which the eunuchs took to her. ”
NCV	Esther	1	16	Then Memucan said to the king and the other important men , “ Queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king alone . She has also done wrong to all the important men and all the people in all the empire of King Xerxes .
NCV	Esther	1	17	All the wives of the important men of Persia and Media will hear about the queen ’ s actions . Then they will no longer honor their husbands . They will say , ‘ King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought to him , but she refused to come. ’
NCV	Esther	1	18	Today the wives of the important men of Persia and Media have heard about the queen ’ s actions . So they will speak in the same way to their husbands , and there will be no end to disrespect and anger .
NCV	Esther	1	19	“ So , our king , if it pleases you , give a royal order , and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media , which can not be changed . The law should say Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes . Also let the king give her place as queen to someone who is better than she is .
NCV	Esther	1	20	And let the king ’ s order be announced everywhere in his enormous kingdom . Then all the women will respect their husbands , from the greatest to the least. ”
NCV	Esther	1	21	The king and his important men were happy with this advice , so King Xerxes did as Memucan suggested .
NCV	Esther	1	22	He sent letters to all the states of the kingdom in the writing of each state and in the language of each group of people . These letters announced that each man was to be the ruler of his own family . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Esther	2	2	Then the king ’ s personal servants suggested , “ Let a search be made for beautiful young girls for the king .
NCV	Esther	2	3	Let the king choose supervisors in every state of his kingdom to bring every beautiful young girl to the palace at Susa . They should be taken to the women ’ s quarters and put under the care of Hegai , the king ’ s eunuch in charge of the women . And let beauty treatments be given to them .
NCV	Esther	2	4	Then let the girl who most pleases the king become queen in place of Vashti. ” The king liked this idea , so he did as they said .
NCV	Esther	2	5	Now there was a Jewish man in the palace of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair . Jair was the son of Shimei , the son of Kish . Mordecai was from the tribe of Benjamin ,
NCV	Esther	2	6	which had been taken captive from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . They were part of the group taken into captivity with Jehoiachin king of Judah .
NCV	Esther	2	7	Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah , who had no father or mother , so Mordecai took care of her . Hadassah was also called Esther , and she had a very pretty figure and face . Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter when her father and mother died .
NCV	Esther	2	8	When the king ’ s command and order had been heard , many girls had been brought to the palace in Susa and put under the care of Hegai . Esther was also taken to the king ’ s palace and put under the care of Hegai , who was in charge of the women .
NCV	Esther	2	9	Esther pleased Hegai , and he liked her . So Hegai quickly began giving Esther her beauty treatments and special food . He gave her seven servant girls chosen from the king ’ s palace . Then he moved her and her seven servant girls to the best part of the women ’ s quarters .
NCV	Esther	2	10	Esther did not tell anyone about her family or who her people were , because Mordecai had told her not to .
NCV	Esther	2	11	Every day Mordecai walked back and forth near the courtyard where the king ’ s women lived to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her .
NCV	Esther	2	12	Before a girl could take her turn with King Xerxes , she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments that were ordered for the women . For six months she was treated with oil and myrrh and for six months with perfumes and cosmetics .
NCV	Esther	2	13	Then she was ready to go to the king . Anything she asked for was given to her to take with her from the women ’ s quarters to the king ’ s palace .
NCV	Esther	2	14	In the evening she would go to the king ’ s palace , and in the morning she would return to another part of the women ’ s quarters . There she would be placed under the care of Shaashgaz , the king ’ s eunuch in charge of the slave women . The girl would not go back to the king again unless he was pleased with her and asked for her by name .
NCV	Esther	2	15	The time came for Esther daughter of Abihail , Mordecai ’ s uncle , who had been adopted by Mordecai , to go to the king . She asked for only what Hegai suggested she should take . ( Hegai was the king ’ s eunuch who was in charge of the women . ) Everyone who saw Esther liked her .
NCV	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month , the month of Tebeth , during Xerxes ’ seventh year as king .
NCV	Esther	2	17	And the king was pleased with Esther more than with any of the other virgins . He liked her more than any of the others , so he put a royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti .
NCV	Esther	2	18	Then the king gave a great banquet for Esther and invited all his important men and royal officers . He announced a holiday for all the empire and had the government give away gifts . Mordecai Discovers an Evil Plan
NCV	Esther	2	19	Now Mordecai was sitting at the king ’ s gate when the girls were gathered the second time .
NCV	Esther	2	20	Esther still had not told anyone about her family or who her people were , just as Mordecai had commanded her . She obeyed Mordecai just as she had done when she was under his care .
NCV	Esther	2	21	Now Bigthana and Teresh were two of the king ’ s eunuchs who guarded the doorway . While Mordecai was sitting at the king ’ s gate , they became angry and began to make plans to kill King Xerxes .
NCV	Esther	2	22	But Mordecai found out about their plans and told Queen Esther . Then Esther told the king how Mordecai had discovered the evil plan .
NCV	Esther	2	23	When the report was investigated , it was found to be true , and the two officers who had planned to kill the king were hanged . All this was written down in the daily court record in the king ’ s presence . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Esther	3	3	Then the royal officers at the king ’ s gate asked Mordecai , “ Why don ’ t you obey the king ’ s command ? ”
NCV	Esther	3	2	All the royal officers at the king ’ s gate would bow down and kneel before Haman , as the king had ordered . But Mordecai would not bow down or show him honor .
NCV	Esther	3	4	And they said this to him every day . When he did not listen to them , they told Haman about it . They wanted to see if Haman would accept Mordecai ’ s behavior because Mordecai had told them he was Jewish .
NCV	Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him or honor him , he became very angry .
NCV	Esther	3	6	He thought of himself as too important to try to kill only Mordecai . He had been told who the people of Mordecai were , so he looked for a way to destroy all of Mordecai ’ s people , the Jews , in all of Xerxes ’ kingdom .
NCV	Esther	3	7	It was in the first month of the twelfth year of King Xerxes ’ rule—the month of Nisan . Pur ( that is , the lot ) was thrown before Haman to choose a day and a month . So the twelfth month , the month of Adar , was chosen .
NCV	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to King Xerxes , “ There is a certain group of people scattered among the other people in all the states of your kingdom . Their customs are different from those of all the other people , and they do not obey the king ’ s laws . It is not right for you to allow them to continue living in your kingdom .
NCV	Esther	3	9	If it pleases the king , let an order be given to destroy those people . Then I will pay seven hundred fifty thousand pounds of silver to those who do the king ’ s business , and they will put it into the royal treasury. ”
NCV	Esther	3	10	So the king took his signet ring off and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of the Jewish people .
NCV	Esther	3	11	Then the king said to Haman , “ The money and the people are yours . Do with them as you please. ”
NCV	Esther	3	12	On the thirteenth day of the first month , the royal secretaries were called , and they wrote out all of Haman ’ s orders . They wrote to the king ’ s governors and to the captains of the soldiers in each state and to the important men of each group of people . The orders were written in the writing of each state and in the language of each people . They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his signet ring .
NCV	Esther	3	13	Letters were sent by messengers to all the king ’ s empire ordering them to destroy , kill , and completely wipe out all the Jewish people . That meant young and old , women and little children , too . It was to happen on a single day—the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which was Adar . And they could take everything the Jewish people owned .
NCV	Esther	3	14	A copy of the order was given out as a law in every state so all the people would be ready for that day .
NCV	Esther	3	15	The messengers set out , hurried by the king ’ s command , as soon as the order was given in the palace at Susa . The king and Haman sat down to drink , but the city of Susa was in confusion . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Esther	4	4	When Esther ’ s servant girls and eunuchs came to her and told her about Mordecai , she was very upset and afraid . She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on instead of the rough cloth , but he would not wear them .
NCV	Esther	4	2	But Mordecai went only as far as the king ’ s gate , because no one was allowed to enter that gate dressed in rough cloth .
NCV	Esther	4	3	As the king ’ s order reached every area , there was great sadness and loud crying among the Jewish people . They fasted and cried out loud , and many of them lay down on rough cloth and ashes to show how sad they were .
NCV	Esther	4	5	Then Esther called for Hathach , one of the king ’ s eunuchs chosen by the king to serve her . Esther ordered him to find out what was bothering Mordecai and why .
NCV	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went to Mordecai , who was in the city square in front of the king ’ s gate .
NCV	Esther	4	7	Mordecai told Hathach everything that had happened to him , and he told Hathach about the amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the king ’ s treasury for the killing of the Jewish people .
NCV	Esther	4	8	Mordecai also gave him a copy of the order to kill the Jewish people , which had been given in Susa . He wanted Hathach to show it to Esther and to tell her about it . And Mordecai told him to order Esther to go into the king ’ s presence to beg for mercy and to plead with him for her people .
NCV	Esther	4	9	Hathach went back and reported to Esther everything Mordecai had said .
NCV	Esther	4	10	Then Esther told Hathach to tell Mordecai ,
NCV	Esther	4	11	“ All the royal officers and people of the royal states know that no man or woman may go to the king in the inner courtyard without being called . There is only one law about this : Anyone who enters must be put to death unless the king holds out his gold scepter . Then that person may live . And I have not been called to go to the king for thirty days. ”
NCV	Esther	4	12	Esther ’ s message was given to Mordecai .
NCV	Esther	4	13	Then Mordecai sent back word to Esther : “ Just because you live in the king ’ s palace , don ’ t think that out of all the Jewish people you alone will escape .
NCV	Esther	4	14	If you keep quiet at this time , someone else will help and save the Jewish people , but you and your father ’ s family will all die . And who knows , you may have been chosen queen for just such a time as this. ”
NCV	Esther	4	15	Then Esther sent this answer to Mordecai :
NCV	Esther	4	16	“ Go and get all the Jewish people in Susa together . For my sake , fast ; do not eat or drink for three days , night and day . I and my servant girls will also fast . Then I will go to the king , even though it is against the law , and if I die , I die. ”

NCV	Esther	5	5	Then the king said , “ Bring Haman quickly so we may do what Esther asks. ” So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared for them .
NCV	Esther	5	2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard , he was pleased . He held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand , so Esther went forward and touched the end of it .
NCV	Esther	5	3	The king asked , “ What is it , Queen Esther ? What do you want to ask me ? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom. ”
NCV	Esther	5	4	Esther answered , “ My king , if it pleases you , come today with Haman to a banquet that I have prepared for you. ”
NCV	Esther	5	6	As they were drinking wine , the king said to Esther , “ Now , what are you asking for ? I will give it to you . What is it you want ? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom. ”
NCV	Esther	5	7	Esther answered , “ This is what I want and what I ask for .
NCV	Esther	5	8	My king , if you are pleased with me and if it pleases you , give me what I ask for and do what I want . Come with Haman tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for you . Then I will answer your question about what I want. ” Haman ’ s Plans Against Mordecai
NCV	Esther	5	9	Haman left the king ’ s palace that day happy and content . But when he saw Mordecai at the king ’ s gate and saw that Mordecai did not stand up or tremble with fear before him , Haman became very angry with Mordecai .
NCV	Esther	5	10	But he controlled his anger and went home . Then Haman called together his friends and his wife , Zeresh .
NCV	Esther	5	11	He told them how wealthy he was and how many sons he had . He also told them all the ways the king had honored him and how the king had placed him higher than his important men and his royal officers .
NCV	Esther	5	12	He also said , “ I ’ m the only person Queen Esther invited to come with the king to the banquet she gave . And tomorrow also the queen has asked me to be her guest with the king .
NCV	Esther	5	13	But all this does not really make me happy when I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king ’ s gate. ”
NCV	Esther	5	14	Then Haman ’ s wife , Zeresh , and all his friends said , “ Have a seventy-five foot platform built , and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it . Then go to the banquet with the king and be happy. ” Haman liked this suggestion , so he ordered the platform to be built . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in . And the king asked him , “ What should be done for a man whom the king wants very much to honor ? ” And Haman thought to himself , “ Whom would the king want to honor more than me ? ”
NCV	Esther	6	2	It was found recorded that Mordecai had warned the king about Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king ’ s officers who guarded the doorway and who had planned to kill the king .
NCV	Esther	6	3	The king asked , “ What honor and reward have been given to Mordecai for this ? ” The king ’ s personal servants answered , “ Nothing has been done for Mordecai. ”
NCV	Esther	6	4	The king said , “ Who is in the courtyard ? ” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king ’ s palace . He had come to ask the king about hanging Mordecai on the platform he had prepared .
NCV	Esther	6	5	The king ’ s personal servants said , “ Haman is standing in the courtyard. ” The king said , “ Bring him in. ”
NCV	Esther	6	7	So he answered the king , “ This is what you could do for the man you want very much to honor .
NCV	Esther	6	8	Have the servants bring a royal robe that the king himself has worn . And also bring a horse with a royal crown on its head , a horse that the king himself has ridden .
NCV	Esther	6	9	Let the robe and the horse be given to one of the king ’ s most important men . Let the servants put the robe on the man the king wants to honor , and let them lead him on the horse through the city streets . As they are leading him , let them announce : ‘ This is what is done for the man whom the king wants to honor ! ’ ”
NCV	Esther	6	10	The king commanded Haman , “ Go quickly . Take the robe and the horse just as you have said , and do all this for Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king ’ s gate . Do not leave out anything you have suggested. ”
NCV	Esther	6	11	So Haman took the robe and the horse , and he put the robe on Mordecai . Then he led him on horseback through the city streets , announcing before Mordecai : “ This is what is done for the man whom the king wants to honor ! ”
NCV	Esther	6	12	Then Mordecai returned to the king ’ s gate , but Haman hurried home with his head covered , because he was embarrassed and ashamed .
NCV	Esther	6	13	He told his wife , Zeresh , and all his friends everything that had happened to him . Haman ’ s wife and the men who gave him advice said , “ You are starting to lose power to Mordecai . Since he is a Jew , you can not win against him . You will surely be ruined. ”

NCV	Esther	7	7	The king was very angry , so he got up , left his wine , and went out into the palace garden . But Haman stayed inside to beg Queen Esther to save his life . He could see that the king had already decided to kill him .
NCV	Esther	7	2	As they were drinking wine on the second day , the king asked Esther again , “ What are you asking for ? I will give it to you . What is it you want ? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom. ”
NCV	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered , “ My king , if you are pleased with me , and if it pleases you , let me live . This is what I ask . And let my people live , too . This is what I want .
NCV	Esther	7	4	My people and I have been sold to be destroyed , to be killed and completely wiped out . If we had been sold as male and female slaves , I would have kept quiet , because that would not be enough of a problem to bother the king. ”
NCV	Esther	7	5	Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther , “ Who is he , and where is he ? Who has done such a thing ? ”
NCV	Esther	7	6	Esther said , “ Our enemy and foe is this wicked Haman ! ” Then Haman was filled with terror before the king and queen .
NCV	Esther	7	8	When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall , he saw Haman falling on the couch where Esther was lying . The king said , “ Will he even attack the queen while I am in the house ? ” As soon as the king said that , servants came in and covered Haman ’ s face .
NCV	Esther	7	9	Harbona , one of the eunuchs there serving the king , said , “ Look , a seventy-five foot platform stands near Haman ’ s house . This is the one Haman had prepared for Mordecai , who gave the warning that saved the king. ” The king said , “ Hang Haman on it ! ”

NCV	Esther	8	8	Now , in the king ’ s name , write another order to the Jewish people as it seems best to you . Then seal the order with the king ’ s signet ring , because no letter written in the king ’ s name and sealed with his signet ring can be canceled. ”
NCV	Esther	8	2	Then the king took off his signet ring that he had taken back from Haman , and he gave it to Mordecai . Esther put Mordecai in charge of everything Haman left when he died .
NCV	Esther	8	3	Once again Esther spoke to the king . She fell at the king ’ s feet and cried and begged him to stop the evil plan that Haman the Agagite had planned against the Jews .
NCV	Esther	8	4	The king held out the gold scepter to Esther . So Esther got up and stood in front of him .
NCV	Esther	8	5	She said , “ My king , if you are pleased with me , and if it pleases you to do this , if you think it is the right thing to do , and if you are happy with me , let an order be written to cancel the letters Haman wrote . Haman the Agagite sent messages to destroy all the Jewish people in all of your kingdom .
NCV	Esther	8	6	I could not stand to see that terrible thing happen to my people . I could not stand to see my family killed. ”
NCV	Esther	8	7	King Xerxes answered Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew , “ Because Haman was against the Jewish people , I have given his things to Esther , and my soldiers have hanged him .
NCV	Esther	8	9	At that time the king ’ s secretaries were called . This was the twenty-third day of the third month , which is Sivan . The secretaries wrote out all of Mordecai ’ s orders to the Jews , to the governors , to the captains of the soldiers in each state , and to the important men of the one hundred twenty-seven states that reached from India to Cush . They wrote in the writing of each state and in the language of each people . They also wrote to the Jewish people in their own writing and language .
NCV	Esther	8	10	Mordecai wrote orders in the name of King Xerxes and sealed the letters with the king ’ s signet ring . Then he sent the king ’ s orders by messengers on fast horses , horses that were raised just for the king .
NCV	Esther	8	11	These were the king ’ s orders : The Jewish people in every city have the right to gather together to protect themselves . They may destroy , kill , and completely wipe out the army of any state or people who attack them . And they are to do the same to the women and children of that army . They may also take by force the property of their enemies .
NCV	Esther	8	12	The one day set for the Jewish people to do this in all the empire of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar .
NCV	Esther	8	13	A copy of the king ’ s order was to be sent out as a law in every state . It was to be made known to the people of every nation living in the kingdom so the Jewish people would be ready on that set day to strike back at their enemies .
NCV	Esther	8	14	The messengers hurried out , riding on the royal horses , because the king commanded those messengers to hurry . And the order was also given in the palace at Susa .
NCV	Esther	8	15	Mordecai left the king ’ s presence wearing royal clothes of blue and white and a large gold crown . He also had a purple robe made of the best linen . And the people of Susa shouted for joy .
NCV	Esther	8	16	It was a time of happiness , joy , gladness , and honor for the Jewish people .
NCV	Esther	8	17	As the king ’ s order went to every state and city , there was joy and gladness among the Jewish people . In every state and city to which the king ’ s order went , they were having feasts and celebrating . And many people through all the empire became Jews , because they were afraid of the Jewish people . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Esther	9	9	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vaizatha ,
NCV	Esther	9	2	The Jews met in their cities in all the empire of King Xerxes in order to attack those who wanted to harm them . No one was strong enough to fight against them , because all the other people living in the empire were afraid of them .
NCV	Esther	9	3	All the important men of the states , the governors , captains of the soldiers , and the king ’ s officers helped the Jewish people , because they were afraid of Mordecai .
NCV	Esther	9	4	Mordecai was very important in the king ’ s palace . He was famous in all the empire , because he was becoming a leader of more and more people .
NCV	Esther	9	5	And , with their swords , the Jewish people defeated all their enemies , killing and destroying them . And they did what they wanted with those people who hated them .
NCV	Esther	9	6	In the palace at Susa , they killed and destroyed five hundred men .
NCV	Esther	9	7	They also killed : Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
NCV	Esther	9	8	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
NCV	Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman , son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jewish people . But the Jewish people did not take their belongings .
NCV	Esther	9	11	On that day the number killed in the palace at Susa was reported to the king .
NCV	Esther	9	12	The king said to Queen Esther , “ The Jewish people have killed and destroyed five hundred people in the palace at Susa , and they have also killed Haman ’ s ten sons . What have they done in the rest of the king ’ s empire ! Now what else are you asking ? I will do it ! What else do you want ? It will be done ! ”
NCV	Esther	9	13	Esther answered , “ If it pleases the king , give the Jewish people who are in Susa permission to do again tomorrow what the king ordered for today . And let the bodies of Haman ’ s ten sons be hanged on the platform. ”
NCV	Esther	9	14	So the king ordered that it be done . A law was given in Susa , and the bodies of the ten sons of Haman were hanged .
NCV	Esther	9	15	The Jewish people in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar . They killed three hundred people in Susa , but they did not take their belongings .
NCV	Esther	9	16	At that same time , all the Jewish people in the king ’ s empire also met to protect themselves and get rid of their enemies . They killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them , but they did not take their belongings .
NCV	Esther	9	17	This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar . On the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of joyful feasting . The Feast of Purim
NCV	Esther	9	18	But the Jewish people in Susa met on the thirteenth and fourteenth days of the month of Adar . Then they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of joyful feasting .
NCV	Esther	9	19	This is why the Jewish people who live in the country and small villages celebrate on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar . It is a day of joyful feasting and a day for exchanging gifts .
NCV	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote down everything that had happened . Then he sent letters to all the Jewish people in all the empire of King Xerxes , far and near .
NCV	Esther	9	21	He told them to celebrate every year on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar ,
NCV	Esther	9	22	because that was when the Jewish people got rid of their enemies . They were also to celebrate it as the month their sadness was turned to joy and their crying for the dead was turned into celebration . He told them to celebrate those days as days of joyful feasting and as a time for giving food to each other and presents to the poor .
NCV	Esther	9	23	So the Jewish people agreed to do what Mordecai had written to them , and they agreed to hold the celebration every year .
NCV	Esther	9	24	Haman son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , was the enemy of all the Jewish people . He had made an evil plan against the Jewish people to destroy them , and he had thrown the Pur ( that is , the lot ) to choose a day to ruin and destroy them .
NCV	Esther	9	25	But when the king learned of the evil plan , he sent out written orders that the evil plans Haman had made against the Jewish people would be used against him . And those orders said that Haman and his sons should be hanged on the platform .
NCV	Esther	9	26	So these days were called Purim , which comes from the word “ Pur ” ( the lot ) . Because of everything written in this letter and what they had seen and what happened to them ,
NCV	Esther	9	27	the Jewish people set up this custom . They and their descendants and all those who join them are always to celebrate these two days every year . They should do it in the right way and at the time Mordecai had ordered them in the letter .
NCV	Esther	9	28	These two days should be remembered and celebrated from now on in every family , in every state , and in every city . These days of Purim should always be celebrated by the Jewish people , and their descendants should always remember to celebrate them , too .
NCV	Esther	9	29	So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail , along with Mordecai the Jew , wrote this second letter about Purim . Using the power they had , they wrote to prove the first letter was true .
NCV	Esther	9	30	And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jewish people in the one hundred twenty-seven states of the kingdom of Xerxes , writing them a message of peace and truth .
NCV	Esther	9	31	He wrote to set up these days of Purim at the chosen times . Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had sent out the order for the Jewish people , just as they had set up things for themselves and their descendants : On these two days the people should fast and cry loudly .

NCV	Job	1	11	But reach out your hand and destroy everything he has , and he will curse you to your face. ”
NCV	Job	1	12	The Lord said to Satan , “ All right , then . Everything Job has is in your power , but you must not touch Job himself. ” Then Satan left the Lord ’ s presence .
NCV	Job	1	13	One day Job ’ s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine together at the oldest brother ’ s house .
NCV	Job	1	14	A messenger came to Job and said , “ The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were eating grass nearby ,
NCV	Job	1	15	when the Sabeans attacked and carried them away . They killed the servants with swords , and I am the only one who escaped to tell you ! ”
NCV	Job	1	16	The messenger was still speaking when another messenger arrived and said , “ Lightning from God fell from the sky . It burned up the sheep and the servants , and I am the only one who escaped to tell you ! ”
NCV	Job	1	17	The second messenger was still speaking when another messenger arrived and said , “ The Babylonians sent three groups of attackers that swept down and stole your camels and killed the servants . I am the only one who escaped to tell you ! ”
NCV	Job	1	18	The third messenger was still speaking when another messenger arrived and said , “ Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine together at the oldest brother ’ s house .
NCV	Job	1	19	Suddenly a great wind came from the desert , hitting all four corners of the house at once . The house fell in on the young people , and they are all dead . I am the only one who escaped to tell you ! ”
NCV	Job	1	20	When Job heard this , he got up and tore his robe and shaved his head to show how sad he was . Then he bowed down to the ground to worship God .
NCV	Job	1	21	He said : “ I was naked when I was born , and I will be naked when I die . The Lord gave these things to me , and he has taken them away . Praise the name of the Lord. ”

NCV	Job	2	2	The Lord said to Satan , “ Where have you come from ? ” Satan answered the Lord , “ I have been wandering around the earth , going back and forth in it. ”
NCV	Job	2	3	Then the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you noticed my servant Job ? No one else on earth is like him . He is an honest and innocent man , honoring God and staying away from evil . You caused me to ruin him for no good reason , but he continues to be without blame. ”
NCV	Job	2	4	“ One skin for another ! ” Satan answered . “ A man will give all he has to save his own life .
NCV	Job	2	5	But reach out your hand and destroy his flesh and bones , and he will curse you to your face. ”
NCV	Job	2	6	The Lord said to Satan , “ All right , then . Job is in your power , but you may not take his life. ”
NCV	Job	2	7	So Satan left the Lord ’ s presence . He put painful sores on Job ’ s body , from the top of his head to the soles of his feet .
NCV	Job	2	8	Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself , and he sat in ashes in misery .
NCV	Job	2	9	Job ’ s wife said to him , “ Why are you trying to stay innocent ? Curse God and die ! ”
NCV	Job	2	10	Job answered , “ You are talking like a foolish woman . Should we take only good things from God and not trouble ? ” In spite of all this Job did not sin in what he said . Job ’ s Three Friends Come to Help
NCV	Job	2	11	Now Job had three friends : Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite . When these friends heard about Job ’ s troubles , they agreed to meet and visit him . They wanted to show their concern and to comfort him .
NCV	Job	2	12	They saw Job from far away , but he looked so different they almost didn ’ t recognize him . They began to cry loudly and tore their robes and put dirt on their heads to show how sad they were .
NCV	Job	2	13	Then they sat on the ground with Job seven days and seven nights . No one said a word to him because they saw how much he was suffering . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Job	3	3	“ Let the day I was born be destroyed , and the night it was said , ‘ A boy is born ! ’
NCV	Job	3	2	saying :
NCV	Job	3	4	Let that day turn to darkness . Don ’ t let God care about it . Don ’ t let light shine on it .
NCV	Job	3	5	Let darkness and gloom have that day . Let a cloud hide it . Let thick darkness cover its light .
NCV	Job	3	6	Let thick darkness capture that night . Don ’ t count it among the days of the year or put it in any of the months .
NCV	Job	3	7	Let that night be empty , with no shout of joy to be heard .
NCV	Job	3	8	Let those who curse days curse that day . Let them prepare to wake up the sea monster Leviathan .
NCV	Job	3	9	Let that day ’ s morning stars never appear ; let it wait for daylight that never comes . Don ’ t let it see the first light of dawn ,
NCV	Job	3	10	because it allowed me to be born and did not hide trouble from my eyes .
NCV	Job	3	11	“ Why didn ’ t I die as soon as I was born ? Why didn ’ t I die when I came out of the womb ?
NCV	Job	3	12	Why did my mother ’ s knees receive me , and my mother ’ s breasts feed me ?
NCV	Job	3	13	If they had not been there , I would be lying dead in peace ; I would be asleep and at rest
NCV	Job	3	14	with kings and wise men of the earth who built places for themselves that are now ruined .
NCV	Job	3	15	I would be asleep with rulers who filled their houses with gold and silver .
NCV	Job	3	16	Why was I not buried like a child born dead , like a baby who never saw the light of day ?
NCV	Job	3	17	In the grave the wicked stop making trouble , and the weary workers are at rest .
NCV	Job	3	18	In the grave there is rest for the captives who no longer hear the shout of the slave driver .
NCV	Job	3	19	People great and small are in the grave , and the slave is freed from his master .
NCV	Job	3	20	“ Why is light given to those in misery ? Why is life given to those who are so unhappy ?
NCV	Job	3	21	They want to die , but death does not come . They search for death more than for hidden treasure .
NCV	Job	3	22	They are very happy when they get to the grave .
NCV	Job	3	23	They can not see where they are going . God has hidden the road ahead .
NCV	Job	3	24	I make sad sounds as I eat ; my groans pour out like water .

NCV	Job	4	3	Think about the many people you have taught and the weak hands you have made strong .
NCV	Job	4	5	But now trouble comes to you , and you are discouraged ; trouble hits you , and you are terrified .
NCV	Job	4	6	You should have confidence because you respect God ; you should have hope because you are innocent .
NCV	Job	4	7	“ Remember that the innocent will not die ; honest people will never be destroyed .
NCV	Job	4	8	I have noticed that people who plow evil and plant trouble , harvest it .
NCV	Job	4	9	God ’ s breath destroys them , and a blast of his anger kills them .
NCV	Job	4	10	Lions may roar and growl , but when the teeth of a strong lion are broken ,
NCV	Job	4	11	that lion dies of hunger . The cubs of the mother lion are scattered .
NCV	Job	4	12	“ A word was brought to me in secret , and my ears heard a whisper of it .
NCV	Job	4	13	It was during a nightmare when people are in deep sleep .
NCV	Job	4	14	I was trembling with fear ; all my bones were shaking .
NCV	Job	4	15	A spirit glided past my face , and the hair on my body stood on end .
NCV	Job	4	16	The spirit stopped , but I could not see what it was . A shape stood before my eyes , and I heard a quiet voice .
NCV	Job	4	17	It said , ‘ Can a human be more right than God ? Can a person be pure before his maker ?
NCV	Job	4	18	God does not trust his angels ; he blames them for mistakes .
NCV	Job	4	19	So he puts even more blame on people who live in clay houses , [ a ] whose foundations are made of dust , who can be crushed like a moth .

NCV	Job	5	8	“ But if I were you , I would call on God and bring my problem before him .

NCV	Job	5	10	He gives rain to the earth and sends water on the fields .
NCV	Job	5	11	He makes the humble person important and lifts the sad to places of safety .
NCV	Job	5	12	He ruins the plans of those who trick others so they have no success .
NCV	Job	5	13	He catches the wise in their own clever traps and sweeps away the plans of those who try to trick others .
NCV	Job	5	14	Darkness covers them up in the daytime ; even at noon they feel around in the dark .
NCV	Job	5	15	God saves the needy from their lies and from the harm done by powerful people .
NCV	Job	5	16	So the poor have hope , while those who are unfair are silenced .
NCV	Job	5	17	“ The one whom God corrects is happy , so do not hate being corrected by the Almighty .
NCV	Job	5	18	God hurts , but he also bandages up ; he injures , but his hands also heal .
NCV	Job	5	19	He will save you from six troubles ; even seven troubles will not harm you .
NCV	Job	5	20	God will buy you back from death in times of hunger , and in battle he will save you from the sword .

NCV	Job	6	6	Tasteless food is not eaten without salt , and there is no flavor in the white of an egg .
NCV	Job	6	2	“ I wish my suffering could be weighed and my misery put on scales .
NCV	Job	6	3	My sadness would be heavier than the sand of the seas . No wonder my words seem careless .
NCV	Job	6	4	The arrows of the Almighty are in me ; my spirit drinks in their poison ; God ’ s terrors are gathered against me .
NCV	Job	6	5	A wild donkey does not bray when it has grass to eat , and an ox is quiet when it has feed .
NCV	Job	6	7	I refuse to touch it ; such food makes me sick .
NCV	Job	6	8	“ How I wish that I might have what I ask for and that God would give me what I hope for .

NCV	Job	6	12	I do not have the strength of stone ; my flesh is not bronze .

NCV	Job	6	14	“ They say , ‘ A person ’ s friends should be kind to him when he is in trouble , even if he stops fearing the Almighty. ’
NCV	Job	6	15	But my brothers can not be counted on . They are like streams that do not always flow , streams that sometimes run over .

NCV	Job	6	17	But they stop flowing in the dry season ; they disappear when it is hot .

NCV	Job	8	6	If you are good and honest , he will stand up for you and bring you back where you belong .
NCV	Job	8	7	Where you began will seem unimportant , because your future will be so successful .
NCV	Job	8	9	because we were only born yesterday and know nothing . Our days on earth are only a shadow .

NCV	Job	8	14	What they hope in is easily broken ; what they trust is like a spider ’ s web .
NCV	Job	8	15	They lean on the spider ’ s web , but it breaks . They grab it , but it does not hold up .

NCV	Job	8	18	But if a plant is torn from its place , then that place rejects it and says , ‘ I never saw you. ’
NCV	Job	8	19	Now joy has gone away ; other plants grow up from the same dirt .

NCV	Job	9	9	It is God who made the Bear , Orion , and the Pleiades [ a ] and the groups of stars in the southern sky .
NCV	Job	9	2	“ Yes , I know that this is true , but how can anyone be right in the presence of God ?
NCV	Job	9	3	Someone might want to argue with God , but no one could answer God , not one time out of a thousand .
NCV	Job	9	4	God ’ s wisdom is deep , and his power is great ; no one can fight him without getting hurt .
NCV	Job	9	5	God moves mountains without anyone knowing it and turns them over when he is angry .
NCV	Job	9	6	He shakes the earth out of its place and makes its foundations tremble .
NCV	Job	9	7	He commands the sun not to shine and shuts off the light of the stars .
NCV	Job	9	8	He alone stretches out the skies and walks on the waves of the sea .

NCV	Job	9	17	He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason .
NCV	Job	9	18	He would not let me catch my breath but would overwhelm me with misery .
NCV	Job	9	19	When it comes to strength , God is stronger than I ; when it comes to justice , no one can accuse him .
NCV	Job	9	20	Even if I were right , my own mouth would say I was wrong ; if I were innocent , my mouth would say I was guilty .
NCV	Job	9	21	“ I am innocent , but I don ’ t care about myself . I hate my own life .
NCV	Job	9	22	It is all the same . That is why I say , ‘ God destroys both the innocent and the guilty. ’
NCV	Job	9	23	If the whip brings sudden death , God will laugh at the suffering of the innocent .
NCV	Job	9	24	When the land falls into the hands of evil people , he covers the judges ’ faces so they can ’ t see it . If it is not God who does this , then who is it ?

NCV	Job	12	12	Older people are wise , and long life brings understanding .
NCV	Job	12	2	“ You really think you are the only wise people and that when you die , wisdom will die with you !
NCV	Job	12	3	But my mind is as good as yours ; you are not better than I am . Everyone knows all these things .
NCV	Job	12	4	My friends all laugh at me when I call on God and expect him to answer me ; they laugh at me even though I am right and innocent !
NCV	Job	12	5	Those who are comfortable don ’ t care that others have trouble ; they think it right that those people should have troubles .
NCV	Job	12	6	The tents of robbers are not bothered , and those who make God angry are safe . They have their god in their pocket .
NCV	Job	12	7	“ But ask the animals , and they will teach you , or ask the birds of the air , and they will tell you .
NCV	Job	12	8	Speak to the earth , and it will teach you , or let the fish of the sea tell you .
NCV	Job	12	9	Every one of these knows that the hand of the Lord has done this .
NCV	Job	12	10	The life of every creature and the breath of all people are in God ’ s hand .
NCV	Job	12	11	The ear tests words as the tongue tastes food .
NCV	Job	12	13	“ But only God has wisdom and power , good advice and understanding .
NCV	Job	12	14	What he tears down can not be rebuilt ; anyone he puts in prison can not be let out .
NCV	Job	12	15	If God holds back the waters , there is no rain ; if he lets the waters go , they flood the land .
NCV	Job	12	16	He is strong and victorious ; both the one who fools others and the one who is fooled belong to him .
NCV	Job	12	17	God leads the wise away as captives and turns judges into fools .
NCV	Job	12	18	He takes off chains that kings put on and puts a garment on their bodies .
NCV	Job	12	19	He leads priests away naked and destroys the powerful .
NCV	Job	12	20	He makes trusted people be silent and takes away the wisdom of elders .
NCV	Job	12	21	He brings disgrace on important people and takes away the weapons of the strong .
NCV	Job	12	22	He uncovers the deep things of darkness and brings dark shadows into the light .
NCV	Job	12	23	He makes nations great and then destroys them ; he makes nations large and then scatters them .
NCV	Job	12	24	He takes understanding away from the leaders of the earth and makes them wander through a pathless desert .

NCV	Job	13	13	“ Be quiet and let me speak . Let things happen to me as they will .
NCV	Job	13	2	What you know , I also know . You are not better than I am .
NCV	Job	13	3	But I want to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God .
NCV	Job	13	4	But you smear me with lies . You are worthless doctors , all of you !
NCV	Job	13	5	I wish you would just stop talking ; then you would really be wise !
NCV	Job	13	6	Listen to my argument , and hear the pleading of my lips .
NCV	Job	13	7	You should not speak evil in the name of God ; you can not speak God ’ s truth by telling lies .
NCV	Job	13	8	You should not unfairly choose his side against mine ; you should not argue the case for God .
NCV	Job	13	9	You will not do well if he examines you ; you can not fool God as you might fool humans .
NCV	Job	13	10	God would surely scold you if you unfairly took one person ’ s side .
NCV	Job	13	11	His bright glory would scare you , and you would be very much afraid of him .
NCV	Job	13	12	Your wise sayings are worth no more than ashes , and your arguments are as weak as clay .
NCV	Job	13	14	Why should I put myself in danger and take my life in my own hands ?
NCV	Job	13	15	Even if God kills me , I have hope in him ; I will still defend my ways to his face .
NCV	Job	13	16	This is my salvation . The wicked can not come before him .
NCV	Job	13	17	Listen carefully to my words ; let your ears hear what I say .
NCV	Job	13	18	See , I have prepared my case , and I know I will be proved right .
NCV	Job	13	19	No one can accuse me of doing wrong . If someone can , I will be quiet and die .
NCV	Job	13	20	“ God , please just give me these two things , and then I will not hide from you :
NCV	Job	13	21	Take your punishment away from me , and stop frightening me with your terrors .
NCV	Job	13	22	Then call me , and I will answer , or let me speak , and you answer .
NCV	Job	13	23	How many evil things and sins have I done ? Show me my wrong and my sin .
NCV	Job	13	24	Don ’ t hide your face from me ; don ’ t think of me as your enemy .
NCV	Job	13	25	Don ’ t punish a leaf that is blown by the wind ; don ’ t chase after straw .
NCV	Job	13	26	You write down cruel things against me and make me suffer for my boyhood sins .
NCV	Job	13	27	You put my feet in chains and keep close watch wherever I go . You even mark the soles of my feet .

NCV	Job	14	14	Will the dead live again ? All my days are a struggle ; I will wait until my change comes .
NCV	Job	14	2	We grow up like flowers and then dry up and die . We are like a passing shadow that does not last .
NCV	Job	14	3	Lord , do you need to watch me like this ? Must you bring me before you to be judged ?
NCV	Job	14	4	No one can bring something clean from something dirty .
NCV	Job	14	5	Our time is limited . You have given us only so many months to live and have set limits we can not go beyond .
NCV	Job	14	6	So look away from us and leave us alone until we put in our time like a laborer .
NCV	Job	14	7	“ If a tree is cut down , there is hope that it will grow again and will send out new branches .
NCV	Job	14	8	Even if its roots grow old in the ground , and its stump dies in the dirt ,
NCV	Job	14	9	at the smell of water it will bud and put out new shoots like a plant .
NCV	Job	14	10	But we die , and our bodies are laid in the ground ; we take our last breath and are gone .
NCV	Job	14	11	Water disappears from a lake , and a river loses its water and dries up .
NCV	Job	14	12	In the same way , we lie down and do not rise again ; we will not get up or be awakened until the heavens disappear .
NCV	Job	14	13	“ I wish you would hide me in the grave ; hide me until your anger is gone . I wish you would set a time and then remember me !
NCV	Job	14	15	You will call , and I will answer you ; you will desire the creature your hands have made .
NCV	Job	14	16	Then you will count my steps , but you will not keep track of my sin .
NCV	Job	14	17	My wrongs will be closed up in a bag , and you will cover up my sin .
NCV	Job	14	18	“ A mountain washes away and crumbles ; and a rock can be moved from its place .
NCV	Job	14	19	Water washes over stones and wears them down , and rushing waters wash away the dirt . In the same way , you destroy hope .
NCV	Job	14	20	You defeat people forever , and they are gone ; you change their appearance and send them away .
NCV	Job	14	21	Their children are honored , but they do not know it ; their children are disgraced , but they do not see it .

NCV	Job	15	15	God places no trust in his holy ones , and even the heavens are not pure in his eyes .
NCV	Job	15	2	“ A wise person would not answer with empty words or fill his stomach with the hot east wind .
NCV	Job	15	3	He would not argue with useless words or make speeches that have no value .
NCV	Job	15	4	But you even destroy respect for God and limit the worship of him .
NCV	Job	15	5	Your sin teaches your mouth what to say ; you use words to trick others .
NCV	Job	15	6	It is your own mouth , not mine , that shows you are wicked ; your own lips testify against you .
NCV	Job	15	7	“ You are not the first man ever born ; you are not older than the hills .
NCV	Job	15	8	You did not listen in on God ’ s secret council . But you limit wisdom to yourself .
NCV	Job	15	9	You don ’ t know any more than we know . You don ’ t understand any more than we understand .
NCV	Job	15	10	Old people with gray hair are on our side ; they are even older than your father .
NCV	Job	15	11	Is the comfort God gives you not enough for you , even when words are spoken gently to you ?
NCV	Job	15	12	Has your heart carried you away from God ? Why do your eyes flash with anger ?
NCV	Job	15	13	Why do you speak out your anger against God ? Why do these words pour out of your mouth ?
NCV	Job	15	14	“ How can anyone be pure ? How can someone born to a woman be good ?
NCV	Job	15	16	How much less pure is one who is terrible and rotten and drinks up evil as if it were water !
NCV	Job	15	17	“ Listen to me , and I will tell you about it ; I will tell you what I have seen .
NCV	Job	15	18	These are things wise men have told ; their ancestors told them , and they have hidden nothing .
NCV	Job	15	19	( The land was given to their fathers only , and no foreigner lived among them . )
NCV	Job	15	20	The wicked suffer pain all their lives ; the cruel suffer during all the years saved up for them .
NCV	Job	15	21	Terrible sounds fill their ears , and when things seem to be going well , robbers attack them .
NCV	Job	15	22	Evil people give up trying to escape from the darkness ; it has been decided that they will die by the sword .
NCV	Job	15	23	They wander around and will become food for vultures . They know darkness will soon come .
NCV	Job	15	24	Worry and suffering terrify them ; they overwhelm them , like a king ready to attack ,
NCV	Job	15	25	because they shake their fists at God and try to get their own way against the Almighty .
NCV	Job	15	26	They stubbornly charge at God with thick , strong shields .
NCV	Job	15	27	“ Although the faces of the wicked are thick with fat , and their bellies are fat with flesh ,
NCV	Job	15	28	they will live in towns that are ruined , in houses where no one lives , which are crumbling into ruins .
NCV	Job	15	29	The wicked will no longer get rich , and the riches they have will not last ; the things they own will no longer spread over the land .
NCV	Job	15	30	They will not escape the darkness . A flame will dry up their branches ; God ’ s breath will carry the wicked away .
NCV	Job	15	31	The wicked should not fool themselves by trusting what is useless . If they do , they will get nothing in return .
NCV	Job	15	32	Their branches will dry up before they finish growing and will never turn green .
NCV	Job	15	33	They will be like a vine whose grapes are pulled off before they are ripe , like an olive tree that loses its blossoms .
NCV	Job	15	34	People without God can produce nothing . Fire will destroy the tents of those who take money to do evil ,
NCV	Job	15	35	who plan trouble and give birth to evil , whose hearts plan ways to trick others. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Job	16	16	My face is red from crying ; I have dark circles around my eyes .
NCV	Job	16	2	“ I have heard many things like these . You are all painful comforters !
NCV	Job	16	3	Will your long-winded speeches never end ? What makes you keep on arguing ?
NCV	Job	16	4	I also could speak as you do if you were in my place . I could make great speeches against you and shake my head at you .
NCV	Job	16	5	But , instead , I would encourage you , and my words would bring you relief .
NCV	Job	16	6	“ Even if I speak , my pain is not less , and if I don ’ t speak , it still does not go away .
NCV	Job	16	7	God , you have surely taken away my strength and destroyed my whole family .
NCV	Job	16	8	You have made me thin and weak , and this shows I have done wrong .
NCV	Job	16	9	God attacks me and tears me with anger ; he grinds his teeth at me ; my enemy stares at me with his angry eyes .
NCV	Job	16	10	People open their mouths to make fun of me and hit my cheeks to insult me . They join together against me .
NCV	Job	16	11	God has turned me over to evil people and has handed me over to the wicked .
NCV	Job	16	12	Everything was fine with me , but God broke me into pieces ; he held me by the neck and crushed me . He has made me his target ;
NCV	Job	16	13	his archers surround me . He stabs my kidneys without mercy ; he spills my blood on the ground .
NCV	Job	16	14	Again and again God attacks me ; he runs at me like a soldier .
NCV	Job	16	15	“ I have sewed rough cloth over my skin to show my sadness and have buried my face in the dust .
NCV	Job	16	17	Yet my hands have never done anything cruel , and my prayer is pure .
NCV	Job	16	18	“ Earth , please do not cover up my blood . Don ’ t let my cry ever stop being heard !
NCV	Job	16	19	Even now I have one who speaks for me in heaven ; the one who is on my side is high above .
NCV	Job	16	20	The one who speaks for me is my friend . My eyes pour out tears to God .
NCV	Job	16	21	He begs God on behalf of a human as a person begs for his friend .

NCV	Job	17	4	You have closed their minds to understanding . Do not let them win over me .
NCV	Job	17	5	People might speak against their friends for money , but if they do , the eyes of their children go blind .
NCV	Job	17	6	“ God has made my name a curse word ; people spit in my face .
NCV	Job	17	7	My sight has grown weak because of my sadness , and my body is as thin as a shadow .
NCV	Job	17	8	Honest people are upset about this ; innocent people are upset with those who do wrong .
NCV	Job	17	9	But those who do right will continue to do right , and those whose hands are not dirty with sin will grow stronger .
NCV	Job	17	10	“ But , all of you , come and try again ! I do not find a wise person among you .

NCV	Job	21	29	Have you never asked those who travel ? Have you never listened to their stories ?
NCV	Job	21	30	On the day of God ’ s anger and punishment , it is the wicked who are spared .
NCV	Job	21	31	Who will accuse them to their faces ? Who will pay them back for the evil they have done ?
NCV	Job	21	32	They are carried to their graves , and someone keeps watch over their tombs .
NCV	Job	21	33	The dirt in the valley seems sweet to them . Everybody follows after them , and many people go before them .

NCV	Job	22	22	Accept teaching from his mouth , and keep his words in your heart .
NCV	Job	22	2	“ Can anyone be of real use to God ? Can even a wise person do him good ?
NCV	Job	22	3	Does it help the Almighty for you to be good ? Does he gain anything if you are innocent ?
NCV	Job	22	4	Does God punish you for respecting him ? Does he bring you into court for this ?
NCV	Job	22	5	No ! It is because your evil is without limits and your sins have no end .
NCV	Job	22	6	You took your brothers ’ things for a debt they didn ’ t owe ; you took clothes from people and left them naked .
NCV	Job	22	7	You did not give water to tired people , and you kept food from the hungry .
NCV	Job	22	8	You were a powerful man who owned land ; you were honored and lived in the land .
NCV	Job	22	9	But you sent widows away empty-handed , and you mistreated orphans .
NCV	Job	22	10	That is why traps are all around you and sudden danger frightens you .
NCV	Job	22	11	That is why it is so dark you can not see and a flood of water covers you .
NCV	Job	22	12	“ God is in the highest part of heaven . See how high the highest stars are !
NCV	Job	22	13	But you ask , ‘ What does God know ? Can he judge us through the dark clouds ?
NCV	Job	22	14	Thick clouds cover him so he can not see us as he walks around high up in the sky. ’
NCV	Job	22	15	Are you going to stay on the old path where evil people walk ?
NCV	Job	22	16	They were carried away before their time was up , and their foundations were washed away by a flood .
NCV	Job	22	17	They said to God , ‘ Leave us alone ! The Almighty can do nothing to us. ’
NCV	Job	22	18	But it was God who filled their houses with good things . Their way of thinking is different from mine .
NCV	Job	22	19	“ Good people can watch and be glad ; the innocent can laugh at them and say ,
NCV	Job	22	20	‘ Surely our enemies are destroyed , and fire burns up their wealth. ’
NCV	Job	22	21	“ Obey God and be at peace with him ; this is the way to happiness .
NCV	Job	22	23	If you return to the Almighty , you will be blessed again . So remove evil from your house .
NCV	Job	22	24	Throw your gold nuggets into the dust and your fine gold among the rocks in the ravines .
NCV	Job	22	25	Then the Almighty will be your gold and the best silver for you .
NCV	Job	22	26	You will find pleasure in the Almighty , and you will look up to him .
NCV	Job	22	27	You will pray to him , and he will hear you , and you will keep your promises to him .
NCV	Job	22	28	Anything you decide will be done , and light will shine on your ways .
NCV	Job	22	29	When people are made humble and you say , ‘ Have courage , ’ then the humble will be saved .

NCV	Job	23	23	Then Job answered :
NCV	Job	23	2	“ My complaint is still bitter today . I groan because God ’ s heavy hand is on me .
NCV	Job	23	3	I wish I knew where to find God so I could go to where he lives .
NCV	Job	23	4	I would present my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments .
NCV	Job	23	5	I would learn how he would answer me and would think about what he would say .
NCV	Job	23	6	Would he not argue strongly against me ? No , he would really listen to me .
NCV	Job	23	7	Then an honest person could present his case to God , and I would be saved forever by my judge .
NCV	Job	23	8	“ If I go to the east , God is not there ; if I go to the west , I do not see him .
NCV	Job	23	9	When he is at work in the north , I catch no sight of him ; when he turns to the south , I can not see him .
NCV	Job	23	10	But God knows the way that I take , and when he has tested me , I will come out like gold .
NCV	Job	23	11	My feet have closely followed his steps ; I have stayed in his way ; I did not turn aside .
NCV	Job	23	12	I have never left the commands he has spoken ; I have treasured his words more than my own .
NCV	Job	23	13	“ But he is the only God . Who can come against him ? He does anything he wants .
NCV	Job	23	14	He will do to me what he said he would do , and he has many plans like this .
NCV	Job	23	15	That is why I am frightened of him ; when I think of this , I am afraid of him .
NCV	Job	23	16	God has made me afraid ; the Almighty terrifies me .

NCV	Job	24	24	For a little while they are important , and then they die ; they are laid low and buried like everyone else ; they are cut off like the heads of grain .
NCV	Job	24	2	Wicked people take other people ’ s land ; they steal flocks and take them to new pastures .
NCV	Job	24	3	They chase away the orphan ’ s donkey and take the widow ’ s ox when she has no money .
NCV	Job	24	4	They push needy people off the path ; all the poor of the land hide from them .
NCV	Job	24	5	The poor become like wild donkeys in the desert who go about their job of finding food . The desert gives them food for their children .
NCV	Job	24	6	They gather hay and straw in the fields and pick up leftover grapes from the vineyard of the wicked .
NCV	Job	24	7	They spend the night naked , because they have no clothes , nothing to cover themselves in the cold .
NCV	Job	24	8	They are soaked from mountain rains and stay near the large rocks because they have no shelter .
NCV	Job	24	9	The fatherless child is grabbed from its mother ’ s breast ; they take a poor mother ’ s baby to pay for what she owes .
NCV	Job	24	10	So the poor go around naked without any clothes ; they carry bundles of grain but still go hungry ;
NCV	Job	24	11	they crush olives to get oil and grapes to get wine , but they still go thirsty .
NCV	Job	24	12	Dying people groan in the city , and the injured cry out for help , but God accuses no one of doing wrong .
NCV	Job	24	13	“ Those who fight against the light do not know God ’ s ways or stay in his paths .
NCV	Job	24	14	When the day is over , the murderers get up to kill the poor and needy . At night they go about like thieves .
NCV	Job	24	15	Those who are guilty of adultery watch for the night , thinking , ‘ No one will see us , ’ and they keep their faces covered .
NCV	Job	24	16	In the dark , evil people break into houses . In the daytime they shut themselves up in their own houses , because they want nothing to do with the light .
NCV	Job	24	17	Darkness is like morning to all these evil people who make friends with the terrors of darkness .
NCV	Job	24	18	“ They are like foam floating on the water . Their part of the land is cursed ; no one uses the road that goes by their vineyards .
NCV	Job	24	19	As heat and dryness quickly melt the snow , so the grave quickly takes away the sinners .
NCV	Job	24	20	Their mothers forget them , and worms will eat their bodies . They will not be remembered , so wickedness is broken in pieces like a stick .
NCV	Job	24	21	These evil people abuse women who can not have children and show no kindness to widows .
NCV	Job	24	22	But God drags away the strong by his power . Even though they seem strong , they do not know how long they will live .
NCV	Job	24	23	God may let these evil people feel safe , but he is watching their ways .

NCV	Job	25	25	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered :
NCV	Job	25	2	“ God rules and he must be honored ; he set up order in his high heaven .
NCV	Job	25	3	No one can count God ’ s armies . His light shines on all people .
NCV	Job	25	4	So no one can be good in the presence of God , and no one born to a woman can be pure .
NCV	Job	25	5	Even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes .

NCV	Job	26	26	Then Job answered :
NCV	Job	26	2	“ You are no help to the helpless ! You have not aided the weak !
NCV	Job	26	3	Your advice lacks wisdom ! You have shown little understanding !
NCV	Job	26	4	Who has helped you say these words ? And where did you get these ideas ?
NCV	Job	26	5	“ The spirits of the dead tremble , those who are beneath and in the waters .
NCV	Job	26	6	Death is naked before God ; destruction is uncovered before him .
NCV	Job	26	7	God stretches the northern sky out over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing .
NCV	Job	26	8	He wraps up the waters in his thick clouds , but the clouds do not break under their weight .
NCV	Job	26	9	He covers the face of the moon , spreading his clouds over it .
NCV	Job	26	10	He draws the horizon like a circle on the water at the place where light and darkness meet .
NCV	Job	26	11	Heaven ’ s foundations shake when he thunders at them .
NCV	Job	26	12	With his power he quiets the sea ; by his wisdom he destroys Rahab , the sea monster .
NCV	Job	26	13	He breathes , and the sky clears . His hand stabs the fleeing snake .

NCV	Job	27	27	And Job continued speaking :
NCV	Job	27	2	“ As surely as God lives , who has taken away my rights , the Almighty , who has made me unhappy ,
NCV	Job	27	3	as long as I am alive and God ’ s breath of life is in my nose ,
NCV	Job	27	4	my lips will not speak evil , and my tongue will not tell a lie .
NCV	Job	27	5	I will never agree you are right ; until I die , I will never stop saying I am innocent .
NCV	Job	27	6	I will insist that I am right ; I will not back down . My conscience will never bother me .
NCV	Job	27	7	“ Let my enemies be like evil people , my foes like those who are wrong .
NCV	Job	27	8	What hope do the wicked have when they die , when God takes their life away ?
NCV	Job	27	9	God will not listen to their cries when trouble comes to them .
NCV	Job	27	10	They will not find joy in the Almighty , even though they call out to God all the time .
NCV	Job	27	11	“ I will teach you about the power of God and will not hide the ways of the Almighty .
NCV	Job	27	12	You have all seen this yourselves . So why are we having all this talk that means nothing ?
NCV	Job	27	13	“ Here is what God has planned for evil people , and what the Almighty will give to cruel people :
NCV	Job	27	14	They may have many children , but the sword will kill them . Their children who are left will never have enough to eat .
NCV	Job	27	15	Then they will die of disease and be buried , and the widows will not even cry for them .
NCV	Job	27	16	The wicked may heap up silver like piles of dirt and have so many clothes they are like piles of clay .
NCV	Job	27	17	But good people will wear what evil people have gathered , and the innocent will divide up their silver .
NCV	Job	27	18	The houses the wicked build are like a spider ’ s web , like a hut that a guard builds .
NCV	Job	27	19	The wicked are rich when they go to bed , but they are rich for the last time ; when they open their eyes , everything is gone .
NCV	Job	27	20	Fears come over them like a flood , and a storm snatches them away in the night .
NCV	Job	27	21	The east wind will carry them away , and then they are gone , because it sweeps them out of their place .
NCV	Job	27	22	The wind will hit them without mercy as they try to run away from its power .

NCV	Job	28	28	Then he said to humans , ‘ The fear of the Lord is wisdom ; to stay away from evil is understanding. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Job	28	2	Iron is taken from the ground , and copper is melted out of rocks .
NCV	Job	28	3	Miners bring lights and search deep into the mines for ore in thick darkness .
NCV	Job	28	4	Miners dig a tunnel far from where people live , where no one has ever walked ; they work far from people , swinging and swaying from ropes .
NCV	Job	28	5	Food grows on top of the earth , but below ground things are changed as if by fire .
NCV	Job	28	6	Sapphires are found in rocks , and gold dust is also found there .
NCV	Job	28	7	No hawk knows that path ; the falcon has not seen it .
NCV	Job	28	8	Proud animals have not walked there , and no lions cross over it .
NCV	Job	28	9	Miners hit the rocks of flint and dig away at the bottom of the mountains .
NCV	Job	28	10	They cut tunnels through the rock and see all the treasures there .
NCV	Job	28	11	They search for places where rivers begin and bring things hidden out into the light .
NCV	Job	28	12	“ But where can wisdom be found , and where does understanding live ?
NCV	Job	28	13	People do not understand the value of wisdom ; it can not be found among those who are alive .
NCV	Job	28	14	The deep ocean says , ‘ It ’ s not in me ; ’ the sea says , ‘ It ’ s not in me. ’
NCV	Job	28	15	Wisdom can not be bought with gold , and its cost can not be weighed in silver .
NCV	Job	28	16	Wisdom can not be bought with fine gold or with valuable onyx or sapphire gems .
NCV	Job	28	17	Gold and crystal are not as valuable as wisdom , and you can not buy it with jewels of gold .
NCV	Job	28	18	Coral and jasper are not worth talking about , and the price of wisdom is much greater than rubies .
NCV	Job	28	19	The topaz from Cush can not compare to wisdom ; it can not be bought with the purest gold .
NCV	Job	28	20	“ So where does wisdom come from , and where does understanding live ?
NCV	Job	28	21	It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing , even from the birds of the air .
NCV	Job	28	22	The places of destruction and death say , ‘ We have heard reports about it. ’
NCV	Job	28	23	Only God understands the way to wisdom , and he alone knows where it lives ,
NCV	Job	28	24	because he looks to the farthest parts of the earth and sees everything under the sky .
NCV	Job	28	25	When God gave power to the wind and measured the water ,
NCV	Job	28	26	when he made rules for the rain and set a path for a thunderstorm to follow ,
NCV	Job	28	27	then he looked at wisdom and decided its worth ; he set wisdom up and tested it .

NCV	Job	29	29	Job continued to speak :
NCV	Job	29	2	“ How I wish for the months that have passed and the days when God watched over me .
NCV	Job	29	3	God ’ s lamp shined on my head , and I walked through darkness by his light .
NCV	Job	29	4	I wish for the days when I was strong , when God ’ s close friendship blessed my house .
NCV	Job	29	5	The Almighty was still with me , and my children were all around me .
NCV	Job	29	6	It was as if my path were covered with cream and the rocks poured out olive oil for me .
NCV	Job	29	7	I would go to the city gate and sit in the public square .
NCV	Job	29	8	When the young men saw me , they would step aside , and the old men would stand up in respect .
NCV	Job	29	9	The leading men stopped speaking and covered their mouths with their hands .
NCV	Job	29	10	The voices of the important men were quiet , as if their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths .
NCV	Job	29	11	Anyone who heard me spoke well of me , and those who saw me praised me ,
NCV	Job	29	12	because I saved the poor who called out and the orphan who had no one to help .
NCV	Job	29	13	The dying person blessed me , and I made the widow ’ s heart sing .
NCV	Job	29	14	I put on right living as if it were clothing ; I wore fairness like a robe and a turban .
NCV	Job	29	15	I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame .
NCV	Job	29	16	I was like a father to needy people , and I took the side of strangers who were in trouble .
NCV	Job	29	17	I broke the fangs of evil people and snatched the captives from their teeth .
NCV	Job	29	18	“ I thought , ‘ I will live for as many days as there are grains of sand , and I will die in my own house .
NCV	Job	29	19	My roots will reach down to the water . The dew will lie on the branches all night .
NCV	Job	29	20	New honors will come to me continually , and I will always have great strength. ’
NCV	Job	29	21	“ People listened to me carefully and waited quietly for my advice .
NCV	Job	29	22	After I finished speaking , they spoke no more . My words fell very gently on their ears .
NCV	Job	29	23	They waited for me as they would for rain and drank in my words like spring rain .
NCV	Job	29	24	I smiled at them when they doubted , and my approval was important to them .
NCV	Job	29	25	I chose the way for them and was their leader . I lived like a king among his army , like a person who comforts sad people . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Job	30	30	My skin has become black and peels off , as my body burns with fever .
NCV	Job	30	2	What use did I have for their strength since they had lost their strength to work ?
NCV	Job	30	3	They were thin from hunger and wandered the dry and ruined land at night .
NCV	Job	30	4	They gathered desert plants among the brush and ate the root of the broom tree .
NCV	Job	30	5	They were forced to live away from people ; people shouted at them as if they were thieves .
NCV	Job	30	6	They lived in dried-up streambeds , in caves , and among the rocks .
NCV	Job	30	7	They howled like animals among the bushes and huddled together in the brush .
NCV	Job	30	8	They are worthless people without names and were forced to leave the land .
NCV	Job	30	9	“ Now they make fun of me with songs ; my name is a joke among them .
NCV	Job	30	10	They hate me and stay far away from me , but they do not mind spitting in my face .
NCV	Job	30	11	God has taken away my strength and made me suffer , so they attack me with all their anger .
NCV	Job	30	12	On my right side they rise up like a mob . They lay traps for my feet and prepare to attack me .
NCV	Job	30	13	They break up my road and work to destroy me , and no one helps me .
NCV	Job	30	14	They come at me as if through a hole in the wall , and they roll in among the ruins .
NCV	Job	30	15	Great fears overwhelm me . They blow my honor away as if by a great wind , and my safety disappears like a cloud .
NCV	Job	30	16	“ Now my life is almost over ; my days are full of suffering .
NCV	Job	30	17	At night my bones ache ; gnawing pains never stop .
NCV	Job	30	18	In his great power God grabs hold of my clothing and chokes me with the collar of my coat .
NCV	Job	30	19	He throws me into the mud , and I become like dirt and ashes .
NCV	Job	30	20	“ I cry out to you , God , but you do not answer ; I stand up , but you just look at me .
NCV	Job	30	21	You have turned on me without mercy ; with your powerful hand you attacked me .
NCV	Job	30	22	You snatched me up and threw me into the wind and tossed me about in the storm .
NCV	Job	30	23	I know you will bring me down to death , to the place where all living people must go .
NCV	Job	30	24	“ Surely no one would hurt those who are ruined when they cry for help in their time of trouble .
NCV	Job	30	25	I cried for those who were in trouble ; I have been very sad for poor people .
NCV	Job	30	26	But when I hoped for good , only evil came to me ; when I looked for light , darkness came .
NCV	Job	30	27	I never stop being upset ; days of suffering are ahead of me .

NCV	Job	31	31	The servants of my house have always said , ‘ All have eaten what they want of Job ’ s food. ’
NCV	Job	31	2	What has God above promised for people ? What has the Almighty planned from on high ?
NCV	Job	31	3	It is ruin for evil people and disaster for those who do wrong .
NCV	Job	31	4	God sees my ways and counts every step I take .
NCV	Job	31	5	“ If I have been dishonest or lied to others ,
NCV	Job	31	6	then let God weigh me on honest scales . Then he will know I have done nothing wrong .
NCV	Job	31	7	If I have turned away from doing what is right , or my heart has been led by my eyes to do wrong , or my hands have been made unclean ,
NCV	Job	31	8	then let other people eat what I have planted , and let my crops be plowed up .
NCV	Job	31	9	“ If I have desired another woman or have waited at my neighbor ’ s door for his wife ,
NCV	Job	31	10	then let my wife grind another man ’ s grain , and let other men have sexual relations with her .
NCV	Job	31	11	That would be shameful , a sin to be punished .
NCV	Job	31	12	It is like a fire that burns and destroys ; all I have done would be plowed up .
NCV	Job	31	13	“ If I have been unfair to my male and female slaves when they had a complaint against me ,
NCV	Job	31	14	how could I tell God what I did ? What will I answer when he asks me to explain what I ’ ve done ?
NCV	Job	31	15	God made me in my mother ’ s womb , and he also made them ; the same God formed both of us in our mothers ’ wombs .
NCV	Job	31	16	“ I have never refused the appeals of the poor or let widows give up hope while looking for help .
NCV	Job	31	17	I have not kept my food to myself but have given it to the orphans .
NCV	Job	31	18	Since I was young , I have been like a father to the orphans . From my birth I guided the widows .
NCV	Job	31	19	I have not let anyone die for lack of clothes or let a needy person go without a coat .
NCV	Job	31	20	That person ’ s heart blessed me , because I warmed him with the wool of my sheep .
NCV	Job	31	21	I have never hurt an orphan even when I knew I could win in court .
NCV	Job	31	22	If I have , then let my arm fall off my shoulder and be broken at the joint .
NCV	Job	31	23	I fear destruction from God , and I fear his majesty , so I could not do such things .
NCV	Job	31	24	“ I have not put my trust in gold or said to pure gold , ‘ You are my security. ’
NCV	Job	31	25	I have not celebrated my great wealth or the riches my hands had gained .
NCV	Job	31	26	I have not thought about worshiping the sun in its brightness nor admired the moon moving in glory
NCV	Job	31	27	so that my heart was pulled away from God . My hand has never offered the sun and moon a kiss of worship .
NCV	Job	31	28	If I had , these also would have been sins to be punished , because I would have been unfaithful to God .
NCV	Job	31	29	“ I have not been happy when my enemies fell or laughed when they had trouble .
NCV	Job	31	30	I have not let my mouth sin by cursing my enemies ’ life .
NCV	Job	31	32	No stranger ever had to spend the night in the street , because I always let travelers stay in my home .
NCV	Job	31	33	I have not hidden my sin as others do , secretly keeping my guilt to myself .
NCV	Job	31	34	I was not so afraid of the crowd that I kept quiet and stayed inside because I feared being hated by other families .
NCV	Job	31	35	( “ How I wish a court would hear my case ! Here I sign my name to show I have told the truth . Now let the Almighty answer me ; let the one who accuses me write it down .
NCV	Job	31	36	I would wear the writing on my shoulder ; I would put it on like a crown .
NCV	Job	31	37	I would explain to God every step I took , and I would come near to him like a prince . )

NCV	Job	31	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Job	32	32	These three men stopped trying to answer Job , because he was so sure he was right .
NCV	Job	32	2	But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite , from the family of Ram , became very angry with Job , because Job claimed he was right instead of God .
NCV	Job	32	3	Elihu was also angry with Job ’ s three friends who had no answer to show that Job was wrong , yet continued to blame him .
NCV	Job	32	4	Elihu had waited before speaking to Job , because the three friends were older than he was .
NCV	Job	32	5	But when Elihu saw that the three men had nothing more to say , he became very angry .
NCV	Job	32	6	So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said this : “ I am young , and you are old . That is why I was afraid to tell you what I know .
NCV	Job	32	7	I thought , ‘ Older people should speak , and those who have lived many years should teach wisdom. ’
NCV	Job	32	8	But it is the spirit in a person , the breath of the Almighty , that gives understanding .
NCV	Job	32	9	It is not just older people who are wise ; they are not the only ones who understand what is right .
NCV	Job	32	10	So I say , listen to me . I too will tell you what I know .
NCV	Job	32	11	I waited while you three spoke , and listened to your explanations . While you looked for words to use ,
NCV	Job	32	12	I paid close attention to you . But not one of you has proved Job wrong ; none of you has answered his arguments .
NCV	Job	32	13	Don ’ t say , ‘ We have found wisdom ; only God will show Job to be wrong , not people. ’
NCV	Job	32	14	Job has not spoken his words against me , so I will not use your arguments to answer Job .
NCV	Job	32	15	“ These three friends are defeated and have no more to say ; words have failed them .
NCV	Job	32	16	Now they are standing there with no answers for Job . Now that they are quiet , must I wait to speak ?
NCV	Job	32	17	No , I too will speak and tell what I know .
NCV	Job	32	18	I am full of words , and the spirit in me causes me to speak .
NCV	Job	32	19	I am like wine that has been bottled up ; I am ready to burst like a new leather wine bag .
NCV	Job	32	20	I must speak so I will feel relief ; I must open my mouth and answer .
NCV	Job	32	21	I will be fair to everyone and not flatter anyone .
NCV	Job	32	22	I don ’ t know how to flatter , and if I did , my Maker would quickly take me away . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Job	33	33	But if you have nothing to say , then listen to me ; be quiet , and I will teach you wisdom. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Job	33	2	I open my mouth and am ready to speak .
NCV	Job	33	3	My words come from an honest heart , and I am sincere in saying what I know .
NCV	Job	33	4	The Spirit of God created me , and the breath of the Almighty gave me life .
NCV	Job	33	5	Answer me if you can ; get yourself ready and stand before me .
NCV	Job	33	6	I am just like you before God ; I too am made out of clay .
NCV	Job	33	7	Don ’ t be afraid of me ; I will not be hard on you .
NCV	Job	33	8	“ But I heard what you have said ; I heard every word .
NCV	Job	33	9	You said , ‘ I am pure and without sin ; I am innocent and free from guilt .
NCV	Job	33	10	But God has found fault with me ; he considers me his enemy .
NCV	Job	33	11	He locks my feet in chains and closely watches everywhere I go. ’
NCV	Job	33	12	“ But I tell you , you are not right in saying this , because God is greater than we are .
NCV	Job	33	13	Why do you accuse God of not answering anyone ?
NCV	Job	33	14	God does speak—sometimes one way and sometimes another— even though people may not understand it .
NCV	Job	33	15	He speaks in a dream or a vision of the night when people are in a deep sleep , lying on their beds .
NCV	Job	33	16	He speaks in their ears and frightens them with warnings
NCV	Job	33	17	to turn them away from doing wrong and to keep them from being proud .
NCV	Job	33	18	God does this to save people from death , to keep them from dying .
NCV	Job	33	19	People may be corrected while in bed in great pain ; they may have continual pain in their very bones .
NCV	Job	33	20	They may be in such pain that they even hate food , even the very best meal .
NCV	Job	33	21	Their body becomes so thin there is almost nothing left of it , and their bones that were hidden now stick out .
NCV	Job	33	22	They are near death , and their life is almost over .
NCV	Job	33	23	“ But there may be an angel to speak for him , one out of a thousand , who will tell him what to do .
NCV	Job	33	24	The angel will beg for mercy and say : ‘ Save him from death . I have found a way to pay for his life. ’
NCV	Job	33	25	Then his body is made new like a child ’ s . It will return to the way it was when he was young .
NCV	Job	33	26	That person will pray to God , and God will listen to him . He will see God ’ s face and will shout with happiness . And God will set things right for him again .
NCV	Job	33	27	Then he will say to others , ‘ I sinned and twisted what was right , but I did not receive the punishment I should have received .
NCV	Job	33	28	God bought my life back from death , and I will continue to enjoy life. ’
NCV	Job	33	29	“ God does all these things to a person two or even three times
NCV	Job	33	30	so he won ’ t die as punishment for his sins and so he may still enjoy life .
NCV	Job	33	31	“ Job , pay attention and listen to me ; be quiet , and I will speak .
NCV	Job	33	32	If you have anything to say , answer me ; speak up , because I want to prove you right .
NCV	Job	33	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Job	34	34	“ Those who understand speak , and the wise who hear me say ,
NCV	Job	34	2	“ Hear my words , you wise men ; listen to me , you who know a lot .
NCV	Job	34	3	The ear tests words as the tongue tastes food .
NCV	Job	34	4	Let ’ s decide for ourselves what is right , and let ’ s learn together what is good .
NCV	Job	34	5	“ Job says , ‘ I am not guilty , and God has refused me a fair trial .
NCV	Job	34	6	Instead of getting a fair trial , I am called a liar . I have been seriously hurt , even though I have not sinned. ’
NCV	Job	34	7	There is no other man like Job ; he takes insults as if he were drinking water .
NCV	Job	34	8	He keeps company with those who do evil and spends time with wicked men ,
NCV	Job	34	9	because he says , ‘ It is no use to try to please God. ’
NCV	Job	34	10	“ So listen to me , you who can understand . God can never do wrong ! It is impossible for the Almighty to do evil .
NCV	Job	34	11	God pays people back for what they have done and gives them what their actions deserve .
NCV	Job	34	12	Truly God will never do wrong ; the Almighty will never twist what is right .
NCV	Job	34	13	No one chose God to rule over the earth or put him in charge of the whole world .
NCV	Job	34	14	If God should decide to take away life and breath ,
NCV	Job	34	15	then everyone would die together and turn back into dust .
NCV	Job	34	16	“ If you can understand , hear this ; listen to what I have to say .
NCV	Job	34	17	Can anyone govern who hates what is right ? How can you blame God who is both fair and powerful ?
NCV	Job	34	18	God is the one who says to kings , ‘ You are worthless , ’ or to important people , ‘ You are evil. ’
NCV	Job	34	19	He is not nicer to princes than other people , nor kinder to rich people than poor people , because he made them all with his own hands .
NCV	Job	34	20	They can die in a moment , in the middle of the night . They are struck down , and then they pass away ; powerful people die without help .
NCV	Job	34	21	“ God watches where people go ; he sees every step they take .
NCV	Job	34	22	There is no dark place or deep shadow where those who do evil can hide from him .
NCV	Job	34	23	He does not set a time for people to come before him for judging .
NCV	Job	34	24	Without asking questions , God breaks powerful people into pieces and puts others in their place .
NCV	Job	34	25	Because God knows what people do , he defeats them in the night , and they are crushed .
NCV	Job	34	26	He punishes them for the evil they do so that everyone else can watch ,
NCV	Job	34	27	because they stopped following God and did not care about any of his ways .
NCV	Job	34	28	The cry of the poor comes to God ; he hears the cry of the needy .
NCV	Job	34	29	But if God keeps quiet , who can blame him ? If he hides his face , who can see him ? God still rules over both nations and persons alike .
NCV	Job	34	30	He keeps the wicked from ruling and from trapping others .
NCV	Job	34	31	“ But suppose someone says to God , ‘ I am guilty , but I will not sin anymore .
NCV	Job	34	32	Teach me what I can not see . If I have done wrong , I will not do it again. ’
NCV	Job	34	33	So , Job , should God reward you as you want when you refuse to change ? You must decide , not I , so tell me what you know .
NCV	Job	34	35	‘ Job speaks without knowing what is true ; his words show he does not understand. ’
NCV	Job	34	36	I wish Job would be tested completely , because he answered like an evil man !
NCV	Job	34	37	Job now adds to his sin by turning against God . He claps his hands in protest , speaking more and more against God. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Job	34	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Job	35	35	Then Elihu said :
NCV	Job	35	2	“ Do you think this is fair ? You say , ‘ God will show that I am right , ’
NCV	Job	35	3	but you also ask , ‘ What ’ s the use ? I don ’ t gain anything by not sinning. ’
NCV	Job	35	4	“ I will answer you and your friends who are with you .
NCV	Job	35	5	Look up at the sky and see the clouds so high above you .
NCV	Job	35	6	If you sin , it does nothing to God ; even if your sins are many , they do nothing to him .
NCV	Job	35	7	If you are good , you give nothing to God ; he receives nothing from your hand .
NCV	Job	35	8	Your evil ways only hurt others like yourself , and the good you do only helps other human beings .
NCV	Job	35	9	“ People cry out when they are in trouble ; they beg for relief from powerful people .
NCV	Job	35	10	But no one asks , ‘ Where is God , my Maker , who gives us songs in the night ,
NCV	Job	35	11	who makes us smarter than the animals of the earth and wiser than the birds of the air ? ’
NCV	Job	35	12	God does not answer evil people when they cry out , because the wicked are proud .
NCV	Job	35	13	God does not listen to their useless begging ; the Almighty pays no attention to them .
NCV	Job	35	14	He will listen to you even less when you say that you do not see him , that your case is before him , that you must wait for him ,
NCV	Job	35	15	that his anger never punishes , and that he doesn ’ t notice evil .
NCV	Job	35	16	So Job is only speaking nonsense , saying many words without knowing what is true. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Job	36	36	Elihu continued :
NCV	Job	36	2	“ Listen to me a little longer , and I will show you that there is more to be said for God .
NCV	Job	36	3	What I know comes from far away . I will show that my Maker is right .
NCV	Job	36	4	You can be sure that my words are not false ; one who really knows is with you .
NCV	Job	36	5	“ God is powerful , but he does not hate people ; he is powerful and sure of what he wants to do .
NCV	Job	36	6	He will not keep evil people alive , but he gives the poor their rights .
NCV	Job	36	7	He always watches over those who do right ; he sets them on thrones with kings and they are honored forever .
NCV	Job	36	8	If people are bound in chains , or if trouble , like ropes , ties them up ,
NCV	Job	36	9	God tells them what they have done , that they have sinned in their pride .
NCV	Job	36	10	God makes them listen to his warning and commands them to change from doing evil .
NCV	Job	36	11	If they obey and serve him , the rest of their lives will be successful , and the rest of their years will be happy .
NCV	Job	36	12	But if they do not listen , they will die by the sword , and they will die without knowing why .
NCV	Job	36	13	“ Those who have wicked hearts hold on to anger . Even when God punishes them , they do not cry for help .
NCV	Job	36	14	They die while they are still young , and their lives end in disgrace .
NCV	Job	36	15	But God saves those who suffer through their suffering ; he gets them to listen through their pain .
NCV	Job	36	16	“ God is gently calling you from the jaws of trouble to an open place of freedom where he has set your table full of the best food .
NCV	Job	36	17	But now you are being punished like the wicked ; you are getting justice .
NCV	Job	36	18	Be careful ! Don ’ t be led away from God by riches ; don ’ t let much money turn you away .
NCV	Job	36	19	Neither your wealth nor all your great strength will keep you out of trouble .
NCV	Job	36	20	Don ’ t wish for the night when people are taken from their homes .
NCV	Job	36	21	Be careful not to turn to evil , which you seem to want more than suffering .
NCV	Job	36	22	“ God is great and powerful ; no other teacher is like him .
NCV	Job	36	23	No one has planned his ways for him ; no one can say to God , ‘ You have done wrong. ’
NCV	Job	36	24	Remember to praise his work , about which people have sung .
NCV	Job	36	25	Everybody has seen it ; people look at it from far off .
NCV	Job	36	26	God is so great , greater than we can understand ! No one knows how old he is .
NCV	Job	36	27	“ He evaporates the drops of water from the earth and turns them into rain .
NCV	Job	36	28	The rain then pours down from the clouds , and showers fall on people .
NCV	Job	36	29	No one understands how God spreads out the clouds or how he sends thunder from where he lives .
NCV	Job	36	30	Watch how God scatters his lightning around him , lighting up the deepest parts of the sea .
NCV	Job	36	31	This is the way God governs the nations ; this is how he gives us enough food .
NCV	Job	36	32	God fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its target .

NCV	Job	37	37	“ At the sound of his thunder , my heart pounds as if it will jump out of my chest .
NCV	Job	37	2	Listen ! Listen to the thunder of God ’ s voice and to the rumbling that comes from his mouth .
NCV	Job	37	3	He turns his lightning loose under the whole sky and sends it to the farthest parts of the earth .
NCV	Job	37	4	After that you can hear the roar when he thunders with a great sound . He does not hold back the flashing when his voice is heard .
NCV	Job	37	5	God ’ s voice thunders in wonderful ways ; he does great things we can not understand .
NCV	Job	37	6	He says to the snow , ‘ Fall on the earth , ’ and to the shower , ‘ Be a heavy rain. ’
NCV	Job	37	7	With it , he stops everyone from working so everyone knows it is the work of God .
NCV	Job	37	8	The animals take cover from the rain and stay in their dens .
NCV	Job	37	9	The storm comes from where it was stored ; the cold comes with the strong winds .
NCV	Job	37	10	The breath of God makes ice , and the wide waters become frozen .
NCV	Job	37	11	He fills the clouds with water and scatters his lightning through them .
NCV	Job	37	12	At his command they swirl around over the whole earth , doing whatever he commands .
NCV	Job	37	13	He uses the clouds to punish people or to water his earth and show his love .
NCV	Job	37	14	“ Job , listen to this : Stop and notice God ’ s miracles .
NCV	Job	37	15	Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash ?
NCV	Job	37	16	Do you know how the clouds hang in the sky ? Do you know the miracles of God , who knows everything ?
NCV	Job	37	17	You suffer in your clothes when the land is silenced by the hot , south wind .
NCV	Job	37	18	You can not stretch out the sky like God and make it look as hard as polished bronze .
NCV	Job	37	19	Tell us what we should say to him ; we can not get our arguments ready because we do not have enough understanding .
NCV	Job	37	20	Should God be told that I want to speak ? Would a person ask to be swallowed up ?
NCV	Job	37	21	No one can look at the sun when it is bright in the sky after the wind has blown all the clouds away .
NCV	Job	37	22	God comes out of the north in golden light , in overwhelming greatness .
NCV	Job	37	23	The Almighty is too high for us to reach . He has great strength ; he is always right and never punishes unfairly .

NCV	Job	39	16	The ostrich is cruel to its young , as if they were not even its own . It does not care that its work is for nothing ,
NCV	Job	39	17	because God did not give the ostrich wisdom ; God did not give it a share of good sense .
NCV	Job	39	18	But when the ostrich gets up to run , it is so fast that it laughs at the horse and its rider .

NCV	Job	40	40	The Lord said to Job :

NCV	Job	40	4	“ I am not worthy ; I can not answer you anything , so I will put my hand over my mouth .
NCV	Job	40	5	I spoke one time , but I will not answer again ; I even spoke two times , but I will say nothing more. ”

NCV	Job	42	42	Then Job answered the Lord :
NCV	Job	42	2	“ I know that you can do all things and that no plan of yours can be ruined .
NCV	Job	42	3	You asked , ‘ Who is this that made my purpose unclear by saying things that are not true ? ’ Surely I spoke of things I did not understand ; I talked of things too wonderful for me to know .
NCV	Job	42	4	You said , ‘ Listen now , and I will speak . I will ask you questions , and you must answer me. ’
NCV	Job	42	5	My ears had heard of you before , but now my eyes have seen you .
NCV	Job	42	6	So now I hate myself ; I will change my heart and life . I will sit in the dust and ashes. ” End of the Story
NCV	Job	42	7	After the Lord had said these things to Job , he said to Eliphaz the Temanite , “ I am angry with you and your two friends , because you have not said what is right about me , as my servant Job did .
NCV	Job	42	8	Now take seven bulls and seven male sheep , and go to my servant Job , and offer a burnt offering for yourselves . My servant Job will pray for you , and I will listen to his prayer . Then I will not punish you for being foolish . You have not said what is right about me , as my servant Job did. ”
NCV	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite did as the Lord said , and the Lord listened to Job ’ s prayer .
NCV	Job	42	10	After Job had prayed for his friends , the Lord gave him success again . The Lord gave Job twice as much as he had owned before .
NCV	Job	42	11	Job ’ s brothers and sisters came to his house , along with everyone who had known him before , and they all ate with him there . They comforted him and made him feel better about the trouble the Lord had brought on him , and each one gave Job a piece of silver and a gold ring .
NCV	Job	42	12	The Lord blessed the last part of Job ’ s life even more than the first part . Job had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , a thousand teams of oxen , and a thousand female donkeys .
NCV	Job	42	13	Job also had seven sons and three daughters .
NCV	Job	42	14	He named the first daughter Jemimah , the second daughter Keziah , and the third daughter Keren-Happuch .
NCV	Job	42	15	There were no other women in all the land as beautiful as Job ’ s daughters . And their father Job gave them land to own along with their brothers .
NCV	Job	42	16	After this , Job lived one hundred forty years . He lived to see his children , grandchildren , great-grandchildren , and great-great-grandchildren .

NCV	Psalms	1	3	They are strong , like a tree planted by a river . The tree produces fruit in season , and its leaves don ’ t die . Everything they do will succeed .
NCV	Psalms	1	4	But wicked people are not like that . They are like chaff that the wind blows away .

NCV	Psalms	73	73	God is truly good to Israel , to those who have pure hearts .
NCV	Psalms	73	2	But I had almost stopped believing ; I had almost lost my faith
NCV	Psalms	73	3	because I was jealous of proud people . I saw wicked people doing well .
NCV	Psalms	73	4	They are not suffering ; they are healthy and strong .
NCV	Psalms	73	5	They don ’ t have troubles like the rest of us ; they don ’ t have problems like other people .
NCV	Psalms	73	6	They wear pride like a necklace and put on violence as their clothing .

NCV	Psalms	73	9	They brag to the sky . They say that they own the earth .
NCV	Psalms	73	10	So their people turn to them and give them whatever they want .
NCV	Psalms	73	11	They say , “ How can God know ? What does God Most High know ? ”
NCV	Psalms	73	12	These people are wicked , always at ease , and getting richer .
NCV	Psalms	73	13	So why have I kept my heart pure ? Why have I kept my hands from doing wrong ?

NCV	Psalms	74	3	Make your way through these old ruins ; the enemy wrecked everything in the Temple .
NCV	Psalms	74	4	Those who were against you shouted in your meeting place and raised their flags there .

NCV	Psalms	78	78	My people , listen to my teaching ; listen to what I say .
NCV	Psalms	78	2	I will speak using stories ; I will tell secret things from long ago .
NCV	Psalms	78	3	We have heard them and known them by what our ancestors have told us .
NCV	Psalms	78	4	We will not keep them from our children ; we will tell those who come later about the praises of the Lord . We will tell about his power and the miracles he has done .
NCV	Psalms	78	5	The Lord made an agreement with Jacob and gave the teachings to Israel , which he commanded our ancestors to teach to their children .
NCV	Psalms	78	6	Then their children would know them , even their children not yet born . And they would tell their children .
NCV	Psalms	78	7	So they would all trust God and would not forget what he had done but would obey his commands .
NCV	Psalms	78	8	They would not be like their ancestors who were stubborn and disobedient . Their hearts were not loyal to God , and they were not true to him .
NCV	Psalms	78	9	The men of Ephraim had bows for weapons , but they ran away on the day of battle .
NCV	Psalms	78	10	They didn ’ t keep their agreement with God and refused to live by his teachings .
NCV	Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done and the miracles he had shown them .
NCV	Psalms	78	12	He did miracles while their ancestors watched , in the fields of Zoan in Egypt .
NCV	Psalms	78	13	He divided the Red Sea and led them through . He made the water stand up like a wall .
NCV	Psalms	78	14	He led them with a cloud by day and by the light of a fire by night .
NCV	Psalms	78	15	He split the rocks in the desert and gave them more than enough water , as if from the deep ocean .
NCV	Psalms	78	16	He brought streams out of the rock and caused water to flow down like rivers .
NCV	Psalms	78	17	But the people continued to sin against him ; in the desert they turned against God Most High .
NCV	Psalms	78	18	They decided to test God by asking for the food they wanted .
NCV	Psalms	78	19	Then they spoke against God , saying , “ Can God prepare food in the desert ?
NCV	Psalms	78	20	When he hit the rock , water poured out and rivers flowed down . But can he give us bread also ? Will he provide his people with meat ? ”
NCV	Psalms	78	21	When the Lord heard them , he was very angry . His anger was like fire to the people of Jacob ; his anger grew against the people of Israel .
NCV	Psalms	78	22	They had not believed God and had not trusted him to save them .
NCV	Psalms	78	23	But he gave a command to the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven .
NCV	Psalms	78	24	He rained manna down on them to eat ; he gave them grain from heaven .
NCV	Psalms	78	25	So they ate the bread of angels . He sent them all the food they could eat .
NCV	Psalms	78	26	He sent the east wind from heaven and led the south wind by his power .
NCV	Psalms	78	27	He rained meat on them like dust . The birds were as many as the sand of the sea .
NCV	Psalms	78	28	He made the birds fall inside the camp , all around the tents .
NCV	Psalms	78	29	So the people ate and became very full . God had given them what they wanted .
NCV	Psalms	78	30	While they were still eating , and while the food was still in their mouths ,
NCV	Psalms	78	31	God became angry with them . He killed some of the healthiest of them ; he struck down the best young men of Israel .
NCV	Psalms	78	32	But they kept on sinning ; they did not believe even with the miracles .
NCV	Psalms	78	33	So he ended their days without meaning and their years in terror .
NCV	Psalms	78	34	Anytime he killed them , they would look to him for help ; they would come back to God and follow him .
NCV	Psalms	78	35	They would remember that God was their Rock , that God Most High had saved them .
NCV	Psalms	78	36	But their words were false , and their tongues lied to him .
NCV	Psalms	78	37	Their hearts were not really loyal to God ; they did not keep his agreement .
NCV	Psalms	78	38	Still God was merciful . He forgave their sins and did not destroy them . Many times he held back his anger and did not stir up all his anger .
NCV	Psalms	78	39	He remembered that they were only human , like a wind that blows and does not come back .
NCV	Psalms	78	40	They turned against God so often in the desert and grieved him there .
NCV	Psalms	78	41	Again and again they tested God and brought pain to the Holy One of Israel .
NCV	Psalms	78	42	They did not remember his power or the time he saved them from the enemy .
NCV	Psalms	78	43	They forgot the signs he did in Egypt and his wonders in the fields of Zoan .
NCV	Psalms	78	44	He turned their rivers to blood so no one could drink the water .
NCV	Psalms	78	45	He sent flies that bit the people . He sent frogs that destroyed them .
NCV	Psalms	78	46	He gave their crops to grasshoppers and what they worked for to locusts .
NCV	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with sleet .
NCV	Psalms	78	48	He killed their animals with hail and their cattle with lightning .
NCV	Psalms	78	49	He showed them his hot anger . He sent his strong anger against them , his destroying angels .
NCV	Psalms	78	50	He found a way to show his anger . He did not keep them from dying but let them die by a terrible disease .
NCV	Psalms	78	51	God killed all the firstborn sons in Egypt , the oldest son of each family of Ham . [ a ]
NCV	Psalms	78	52	But God led his people out like sheep and he guided them like a flock through the desert .
NCV	Psalms	78	53	He led them to safety so they had nothing to fear , but their enemies drowned in the sea .
NCV	Psalms	78	54	So God brought them to his holy land , to the mountain country he took with his own power .
NCV	Psalms	78	55	He forced out the other nations , and he had his people inherit the land . He let the tribes of Israel settle there in tents .
NCV	Psalms	78	56	But they tested God and turned against God Most High ; they did not keep his rules .
NCV	Psalms	78	57	They turned away and were disloyal just like their ancestors . They were like a crooked bow that does not shoot straight .
NCV	Psalms	78	58	They made God angry by building places to worship gods ; they made him jealous with their idols .
NCV	Psalms	78	59	When God heard them , he became very angry and rejected the people of Israel completely .
NCV	Psalms	78	60	He left his dwelling at Shiloh , the Tent where he lived among the people .
NCV	Psalms	78	61	He let the Ark , his power , be captured ; he let the Ark , his glory , be taken by enemies .
NCV	Psalms	78	62	He let his people be killed ; he was very angry with his children .
NCV	Psalms	78	63	The young men died by fire , and the young women had no one to marry .
NCV	Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword , but their widows were not allowed to cry .
NCV	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord got up as if he had been asleep ; he awoke like a man who had been drunk with wine .
NCV	Psalms	78	66	He struck down his enemies and disgraced them forever .
NCV	Psalms	78	67	But God rejected the family of Joseph ; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim .
NCV	Psalms	78	68	Instead , he chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion , which he loves .
NCV	Psalms	78	69	And he built his Temple high like the mountains . Like the earth , he built it to last forever .
NCV	Psalms	78	70	He chose David to be his servant and took him from the sheep pens .
NCV	Psalms	78	71	He brought him from tending the sheep so he could lead the flock , the people of Jacob , his own people , the people of Israel .

NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	18	I hated all the things I had worked for here on earth , because I must leave them to someone who will live after me .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	19	Someone else will control everything for which I worked so hard here on earth , and I don ’ t know if he will be wise or foolish . This is also useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	20	So I became sad about all the hard work I had done here on earth .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	21	People can work hard using all their wisdom , knowledge , and skill , but they will die , and other people will get the things for which they worked . They did not do the work , but they will get everything . This is also unfair and useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	22	What do people get for all their work and struggling here on earth ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	23	All of their lives their work is full of pain and sorrow , and even at night their minds don ’ t rest . This is also useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	24	The best that people can do is eat , drink , and enjoy their work . I saw that even this comes from God ,
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	25	because no one can eat or enjoy life without him .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	2	26	If people please God , God will give them wisdom , knowledge , and joy . But sinners will get only the work of gathering and storing wealth that they will have to give to the ones who please God . So all their work is useless , like chasing the wind .

NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	3	There is a time to kill and a time to heal . There is a time to destroy and a time to build .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	2	There is a time to be born and a time to die . There is a time to plant and a time to pull up plants .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	4	There is a time to cry and a time to laugh . There is a time to be sad and a time to dance .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	5	There is a time to throw away stones and a time to gather them . There is a time to hug and a time not to hug .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	6	There is a time to look for something and a time to stop looking for it . There is a time to keep things and a time to throw things away .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	7	There is a time to tear apart and a time to sew together . There is a time to be silent and a time to speak .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	8	There is a time to love and a time to hate . There is a time for war and a time for peace . God Controls His World
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	9	Do people really gain anything from their work ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I saw the hard work God has given people to do .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	11	God has given them a desire to know the future . He does everything just right and on time , but people can never completely understand what he is doing .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	12	So I realize that the best thing for them is to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	13	God wants all people to eat and drink and be happy in their work , which are gifts from God .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that everything God does will continue forever . People can not add anything to what God has done , and they can not take anything away from it . God does it this way to make people respect him .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	15	What happens now has happened in the past , and what will happen in the future has happened before . God makes the same things happen again and again . Unfairness on Earth
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	16	I also saw this here on earth : Where there should have been justice , there was evil ; where there should have been right , there was wrong .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said to myself , God has planned a time for every thing and every action , so he will judge both good people and bad .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I decided that God leaves it the way it is to test people and to show them they are just like animals .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	19	The same thing happens to animals and to people ; they both have the same breath , so they both die . People are no better off than the animals , because everything is useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	20	Both end up the same way ; both came from dust and both will go back to dust .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who can be sure that the human spirit goes up to God and that the spirit of an animal goes down into the ground ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So I saw that the best thing people can do is to enjoy their work , because that is all they have . No one can help another person see what will happen in the future . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ecclesiastes	3	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	4	I realized the reason people work hard and try to succeed : They are jealous of each other . This , too , is useless , like chasing the wind .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	2	I decided that the dead are better off than the living .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	3	But those who have never been born are better off still ; they have not seen the evil that is done here on earth . Why Work So Hard ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Some say it is foolish to fold your hands and do nothing , because you will starve to death .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Maybe so , but I say it is better to be content with what little you have . Otherwise , you will always be struggling for more , and that is like chasing the wind .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Again I saw something here on earth that was useless :
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	8	I saw a man who had no family , no son or brother . He always worked hard but was never satisfied with what he had . He never asked himself , “ For whom am I working so hard ? Why don ’ t I let myself enjoy life ? ” This also is very sad and useless . Friends and Family Give Strength
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two people are better than one , because they get more done by working together .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	10	If one falls down , the other can help him up . But it is bad for the person who is alone and falls , because no one is there to help .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	11	If two lie down together , they will be warm , but a person alone will not be warm .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	12	An enemy might defeat one person , but two people together can defend themselves ; a rope that is woven of three strings is hard to break . Fame and Power Are Useless
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	13	A poor but wise boy is better than a foolish but old king who doesn ’ t listen to advice .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	14	A boy became king . He had been born poor in the kingdom and had even gone to prison before becoming king .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I watched all the people who live on earth follow him and make him their king .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	16	Many followed him at first , but later , they did not like him , either . So fame and power are useless , like chasing the wind . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ecclesiastes	4	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	5	It is better not to promise anything than to promise something and not do it .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Think before you speak , and be careful about what you say to God . God is in heaven , and you are on the earth , so say only a few words to God .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	3	The saying is true : Bad dreams come from too much worrying , and too many words come from foolish people .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	4	If you make a promise to God , don ’ t be slow to keep it . God is not happy with fools , so give God what you promised .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Don ’ t let your words cause you to sin , and don ’ t say to the priest at the Temple , “ I didn ’ t mean what I promised. ” If you do , God will become angry with your words and will destroy everything you have worked for .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	7	Many useless promises are like so many dreams ; they mean nothing . You should respect God . Officers Cheat Each Other
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	8	In some places you will see poor people mistreated . Don ’ t be surprised when they are not treated fairly or given their rights . One officer is cheated by a higher officer who in turn is cheated by even higher officers .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	9	The wealth of the country is divided up among them all . Even the king makes sure he gets his share of the profits . Wealth Can not Buy Happiness
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	10	Whoever loves money will never have enough money ; Whoever loves wealth will not be satisfied with it . This is also useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	11	The more wealth people have , the more friends they have to help spend it . So what do people really gain ? They gain nothing except to look at their riches .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	12	Those who work hard sleep in peace ; it is not important if they eat little or much . But rich people worry about their wealth and can not sleep .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	13	I have seen real misery here on earth : Money saved is a curse to its owners .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	14	They lose it all in a bad deal and have nothing to give to their children .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	15	People come into this world with nothing , and when they die they leave with nothing . In spite of all their hard work , they leave just as they came .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	16	This , too , is real misery : They leave just as they came . So what do they gain from chasing the wind ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All they get are days full of sadness and sorrow , and they end up sick , defeated , and angry . Enjoy Your Life ’ s Work
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	18	I have seen what is best for people here on earth . They should eat and drink and enjoy their work , because the life God has given them on earth is short .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	19	God gives some people the ability to enjoy the wealth and property he gives them , as well as the ability to accept their state in life and enjoy their work .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	20	They do not worry about how short life is , because God keeps them busy with what they love to do . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ecclesiastes	5	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	6	Even if he lives two thousand years , he doesn ’ t enjoy the good God gives him . Everyone is going to the same place .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	2	God gives great wealth , riches , and honor to some people ; they have everything they want . But God does not let them enjoy such things ; a stranger enjoys them instead . This is useless and very wrong .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	3	A man might have a hundred children and live a long time , but what good is it if he can ’ t enjoy the good God gives him or have a proper burial ? I say a baby born dead is better off than he is .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	4	A baby born dead is useless . It returns to darkness without even a name .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	5	That baby never saw the sun and never knew anything , but it finds more rest than that man .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	7	People work just to feed themselves , but they never seem to get enough to eat .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	8	In this way a wise person is no better off than a fool . Then , too , it does a poor person little good to know how to get along in life .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	9	It is better to see what you have than to want more . Wanting more is useless— like chasing the wind . Who Can Understand God ’ s Plan ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	10	Whatever happens was planned long ago . Everyone knows what people are like . No one can argue with God , who is stronger than anyone .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	11	The more you say , the more useless it is . What good does it do ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	12	People have only a few useless days of life on the earth ; their short life passes like a shadow . Who knows what is best for them while they live ? Who can tell them what the future will bring ? The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ecclesiastes	6	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Even wise people are fools if they let money change their thinking .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to a funeral than to a party . We all must die , and everyone living should think about this .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Sorrow is better than laughter , and sadness has a good influence on you .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	4	A wise person thinks about death , but a fool thinks only about having a good time .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to be criticized by a wise person than to be praised by a fool .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	6	The laughter of fools is like the crackling of thorns in a cooking fire . Both are useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	8	It is better to finish something than to start it . It is better to be patient than to be proud .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Don ’ t become angry quickly , because getting angry is foolish .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Don ’ t ask , “ Why was life better in the ‘ good old days ’ ? ” It is not wise to ask such questions .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is better when it comes with money . They both help those who are alive .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom is like money : they both help . But wisdom is better , because it can save whoever has it .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Look at what God has done : No one can straighten what he has bent .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When life is good , enjoy it . But when life is hard , remember : God gives good times and hard times , and no one knows what tomorrow will bring . It Is Impossible to Be Truly Good
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	15	In my useless life I have seen both of these : I have seen good people die in spite of their goodness and evil people live a long time in spite of their evil .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Don ’ t be too right , and don ’ t be too wise . Why destroy yourself ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Don ’ t be too wicked , and don ’ t be foolish . Why die before your time ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It is good to grab the one and not let go of the other ; those who honor God will hold them both .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom makes a person stronger than ten leaders in a city .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	20	Surely there is not a good person on earth who always does good and never sins .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Don ’ t listen to everything people say , or you might hear your servant insulting you .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	22	You know that many times you have insulted others .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	23	I used wisdom to test all these things . I wanted to be wise , but it was too hard for me .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	24	I can not understand why things are as they are . It is too hard for anyone to understand .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I studied and tried very hard to find wisdom , to find some meaning for everything . I learned that it is foolish to be evil , and it is crazy to act like a fool .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	26	I found that some women are worse than death and are as dangerous as traps . Their love is like a net , and their arms hold men like chains . A man who pleases God will be saved from them , but a sinner will be caught by them .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	27	The Teacher says , “ This is what I learned : I added all these things together to find some meaning for everything .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	28	While I was searching , I did not find one man among the thousands I found . Nor did I find a woman among all these .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	29	One thing I have learned : God made people good , but they have found all kinds of ways to be bad. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ecclesiastes	7	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	8	No one can control the wind or stop his own death . No soldier is released in times of war , and evil does not set free those who do evil . Justice , Rewards , and Punishment
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	2	Obey the king ’ s command , because you made a promise to God .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Don ’ t be too quick to leave the king . Don ’ t support something that is wrong , because the king does whatever he pleases .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	4	What the king says is law ; no one tells him what to do .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoever obeys the king ’ s command will be safe . A wise person does the right thing at the right time .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	6	There is a right time and a right way for everything , yet people often have many troubles .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	7	They do not know what the future holds , and no one can tell them what will happen .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	9	I saw all of this as I considered all that is done here on earth . Sometimes people harm those they control .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	I saw the funerals of evil people who used to go in and out of the holy place . They were honored in the same towns where they had done evil . This is useless , too .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	When evil people are not punished right away , it makes others want to do evil , too .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Though a sinner might do a hundred evil things and might live a long time , I know it will be better for those who honor God .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	13	I also know it will not go well for evil people , because they do not honor God . Like a shadow , they will not last .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	14	Sometimes something useless happens on earth . Bad things happen to good people , and good things happen to bad people . I say that this is also useless .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I decided it was more important to enjoy life . The best that people can do here on earth is to eat , drink , and enjoy life , because these joys will help them do the hard work God gives them here on earth . We Can not Understand All God Does
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	16	I tried to understand all that happens on earth . I saw how busy people are , working day and night and hardly ever sleeping .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	8	17	I also saw all that God has done . Nobody can understand what God does here on earth . No matter how hard people try to understand it , they can not . Even if wise people say they understand , they can not ; no one can really understand it . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Enjoy life with the wife you love . Enjoy all the useless days of this useless life God has given you here on earth , because it is all you have . So enjoy the work you do here on earth .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	2	Good and bad people end up the same— those who are right and those who are wrong , those who are good and those who are evil , those who are clean and those who are unclean , those who sacrifice and those who do not . The same things happen to a good person as happen to a sinner , to a person who makes promises to God and to one who does not .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is something wrong that happens here on earth : What happens to one happens to all . So people ’ s minds are full of evil and foolish thoughts while they live . After that , they join the dead .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	4	But anyone still alive has hope ; even a live dog is better off than a dead lion !
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	5	The living know they will die , but the dead know nothing . Dead people have no more reward , and people forget them .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	6	After people are dead , they can no longer love or hate or envy . They will never again share in what happens here on earth . Enjoy Life While You Can
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	7	So go eat your food and enjoy it ; drink your wine and be happy , because that is what God wants you to do .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Put on nice clothes and make yourself look good .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatever work you do , do your best , because you are going to the grave , where there is no working , no planning , no knowledge , and no wisdom . Time and Chance
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I also saw something else here on earth : The fastest runner does not always win the race , the strongest soldier does not always win the battle , the wisest does not always have food , the smartest does not always become wealthy , and the talented one does not always receive praise . Time and chance happen to everyone .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	No one knows what will happen next . Like a fish caught in a net , or a bird caught in a trap , people are trapped by evil when it suddenly falls on them . Wisdom Does Not Always Win
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	I also saw something wise here on earth that impressed me .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a small town with only a few people in it . A great king fought against it and put his armies all around it .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	Now there was a poor but wise man in the town who used his wisdom to save his town . But later on , everyone forgot about him .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	16	I still think wisdom is better than strength . But those people forgot about the poor man ’ s wisdom and stopped listening to what he said .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The quiet words of a wise person are better than the shouts of a foolish ruler .

NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	10	A dull ax means harder work . Being wise will make it easier .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	2	The heart of the wise leads to right , but the heart of a fool leads to wrong .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Even in the way fools walk along the road , they show they are not wise ; they show everyone how stupid they are .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	4	Don ’ t leave your job just because your boss is angry with you . Remaining calm solves great problems .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is something else wrong that happens here on earth . It is the kind of mistake rulers make :
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	6	Fools are given important positions while gifted people are given lower ones ;
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants ride horses while princes walk like servants on foot .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	8	Anyone who digs a pit might fall into it ; anyone who knocks down a wall might be bitten by a snake ;
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	9	anyone who moves boulders might be hurt by them ; and anyone who cuts logs might be harmed by them .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	11	If a snake bites the tamer before it is tamed , what good is the tamer ?
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	12	The words of the wise bring them praise , but the words of a fool will destroy them .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	13	A fool begins by saying foolish things and ends by saying crazy and wicked things .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	14	A fool talks too much . No one knows the future , and no one can tell what will happen after death .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	15	Work wears fools out ; they don ’ t even know how to get home . The Value of Work
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	16	How terrible it is for a country whose king is a child and whose leaders eat all morning .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	17	How lucky a country is whose king comes from a good family , whose leaders eat only at mealtime and for strength , not to get drunk .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	18	If someone is lazy , the roof will begin to fall . If he doesn ’ t fix it , the house will leak .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	10	19	A party makes you feel good , wine makes you feel happy , and money buys anything .

NCV	Ecclesiastes	11	8	People ought to enjoy every day of their lives , no matter how long they live . But they should also remember this : You will be dead a long time . Everything that happens then is useless .

NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	12	So be careful , my son , about other teachings . People are always writing books , and too much study will make you tired .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	2	When you get old , the light from the sun , moon , and stars will grow dark ; the rain clouds will never seem to go away .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	3	At that time your arms will shake and your legs will become weak . Your teeth will fall out so you can not chew , and your eyes will not see clearly .

NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	5	You will fear high places and will be afraid to go for a walk . Your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree . You will limp along like a grasshopper when you walk . Your appetite will be gone . Then you will go to your everlasting home , and people will go to your funeral .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	6	Soon your life will snap like a silver chain or break like a golden bowl . You will be like a broken pitcher at a spring , or a broken wheel at a well .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	7	You will turn back into the dust of the earth again , but your spirit will return to God who gave it .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	8	Everything is useless ! The Teacher says that everything is useless . Conclusion : Honor God
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	9	The Teacher was very wise and taught the people what he knew . He very carefully thought about , studied , and set in order many wise teachings .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	10	The Teacher looked for just the right words to write what is dependable and true .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	11	Words from wise people are like sharp sticks used to guide animals . They are like nails that have been driven in firmly . Altogether they are wise teachings that come from one Shepherd .
NCV	Ecclesiastes	12	13	Now , everything has been heard , so I give my final advice : Honor God and obey his commands , because this is all people must do .

NCV	Isaiah	1	2	Heaven and earth , listen , because the Lord is speaking : “ I raised my children and helped them grow up , but they have turned against me .
NCV	Isaiah	1	3	An ox knows its master , and a donkey knows where its owner feeds it , but the people of Israel do not know me ; my people do not understand. ”
NCV	Isaiah	1	4	How terrible ! Israel is a nation of sin , a people loaded down with guilt , a group of children doing evil , children who are full of evil . They have left the Lord ; they hate God , the Holy One of Israel , and have turned away from him as if he were a stranger .
NCV	Isaiah	1	5	Why should you continue to be punished ? Why do you continue to turn against him ? Your whole head is hurt , and your whole heart is sick .
NCV	Isaiah	1	6	There is no healthy spot from the bottom of your foot to the top of your head ; you are covered with wounds , hurts , and open sores that are not cleaned and covered , and no medicine takes away the pain .
NCV	Isaiah	1	7	Your land is ruined ; your cities have been burned with fire . While you watch , your enemies are stealing everything from your land ; it is ruined like a country destroyed by enemies .
NCV	Isaiah	1	8	Jerusalem is left alone like an empty shelter in a vineyard , like a hut left in a field of melons , like a city surrounded by enemies .
NCV	Isaiah	1	9	The Lord All-Powerful allowed a few of our people to live . Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah .
NCV	Isaiah	1	10	Jerusalem , your rulers are like those of Sodom , and your people are like those of Gomorrah . Hear the word of the Lord ; listen to the teaching of our God !
NCV	Isaiah	1	11	The Lord says , “ I do not want all these sacrifices . I have had enough of your burnt sacrifices of male sheep and fat from fine animals . I am not pleased by the blood of bulls , lambs , and goats .
NCV	Isaiah	1	12	You come to meet with me , but who asked you to do all this running in and out of my Temple ’ s rooms ?
NCV	Isaiah	1	13	Don ’ t continue bringing me worthless sacrifices ! I hate the incense you burn . I can ’ t stand your New Moons , Sabbaths , and other feast days ; I can ’ t stand the evil you do in your holy meetings .
NCV	Isaiah	1	14	I hate your New Moon feasts and your other yearly feasts . They have become a heavy weight on me , and I am tired of carrying it .
NCV	Isaiah	1	15	When you raise your arms to me in prayer , I will refuse to look at you . Even if you say many prayers , I will not listen to you , because your hands are full of blood .
NCV	Isaiah	1	16	Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean . Stop doing the evil things I see you do . Stop doing wrong .
NCV	Isaiah	1	17	Learn to do good . Seek justice . Punish those who hurt others . Help the orphans . Stand up for the rights of widows. ”
NCV	Isaiah	1	18	The Lord says , “ Come , let us talk about these things . Though your sins are like scarlet , they can be as white as snow . Though your sins are deep red , they can be white like wool .
NCV	Isaiah	1	19	If you become willing and obey me , you will eat good crops from the land .
NCV	Isaiah	1	20	But if you refuse to obey and if you turn against me , you will be destroyed by your enemies ’ swords. ” The Lord himself said these things . Jerusalem Is Not Loyal to God
NCV	Isaiah	1	21	The city of Jerusalem once followed the Lord , but she is no longer loyal to him . She used to be filled with fairness ; people there lived the way God wanted . But now , murderers live there .
NCV	Isaiah	1	22	Jerusalem , you have become like the scum left when silver is purified ; you are like wine mixed with water .
NCV	Isaiah	1	23	Your rulers are rebels and friends of thieves . They all accept money for doing wrong , and they are paid to cheat people . They don ’ t seek justice for the orphans or listen to the widows ’ needs .
NCV	Isaiah	1	24	So the Lord God All-Powerful , the Mighty One of Israel , says : “ You , my enemies , will not cause me any more trouble . I will pay you back for what you did .
NCV	Isaiah	1	25	I will turn against you and clean away all your wrongs as if with soap ; I will take all the worthless things out of you .
NCV	Isaiah	1	26	I will bring back judges as you had long ago ; your counselors will be like those you had in the beginning . Then you will be called the City That Is Right with God , the Loyal City. ”
NCV	Isaiah	1	27	By doing what is fair , Jerusalem will be free again . By doing what is right , her people who come back to the Lord will have freedom .
NCV	Isaiah	1	28	But sinners and those who turn against him will be destroyed ; those who have left the Lord will die .
NCV	Isaiah	1	29	“ You will be ashamed , because you have worshiped gods under the oak trees . You will be disgraced , because you have worshiped idols in your gardens .
NCV	Isaiah	1	30	You will be like an oak whose leaves are dying or like a garden without water .

NCV	Isaiah	2	2	In the last days the mountain on which the Lord ’ s Temple stands will become the most important of all mountains . It will be raised above the hills , and people from all nations will come streaming to it .
NCV	Isaiah	2	3	Many nations will come and say , “ Come , let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the Temple of the God of Jacob . Then God will teach us his ways , and we will obey his teachings. ” His teachings will go out from Jerusalem ; the message of the Lord will go out from Jerusalem .
NCV	Isaiah	2	4	He will settle arguments among the nations and will make decisions for many nations . Then they will make their swords into plows and their spears into hooks for trimming trees . Nations will no longer fight other nations , nor will they train for war anymore .
NCV	Isaiah	2	5	Come , family of Jacob , and let us follow the way of the Lord . A Terrible Day Is Coming
NCV	Isaiah	2	6	Lord , you have left your people , the family of Jacob , because they have become filled with wrong ideas from people in the East . They try to tell the future like the Philistines , and they have completely accepted those foreign ideas .
NCV	Isaiah	2	7	Their land has been filled with silver and gold ; there are a great many treasures there . Their land has been filled with horses ; there are many chariots there .
NCV	Isaiah	2	8	Their land is full of idols . The people worship these idols they made with their own hands and shaped with their own fingers .
NCV	Isaiah	2	9	People will not be proud any longer but will bow low with shame . God , do not forgive them .
NCV	Isaiah	2	10	Go into the caves of the cliffs ; dig holes and hide in the ground from the anger of the Lord and from his great power !
NCV	Isaiah	2	11	Proud people will be made humble , and they will bow low with shame . At that time only the Lord will still be praised .
NCV	Isaiah	2	12	The Lord All-Powerful has a certain day planned when he will punish the proud and those who brag , and they will no longer be important .
NCV	Isaiah	2	13	He will bring down the tall cedar trees from Lebanon and the great oak trees of Bashan ,
NCV	Isaiah	2	14	all the tall mountains and the high hills ,
NCV	Isaiah	2	15	every tall tower and every high , strong wall ,
NCV	Isaiah	2	16	all the trading ships and the beautiful ships .
NCV	Isaiah	2	17	At that time proud people will be made humble , and they will bow low with shame . At that time only the Lord will be praised ,
NCV	Isaiah	2	18	but all the idols will be gone .
NCV	Isaiah	2	19	People will run to caves in the rocky cliffs and will dig holes and hide in the ground from the anger of the Lord and his great power , when he stands to shake the earth .
NCV	Isaiah	2	20	At that time people will throw away their gold and silver idols , which they made for themselves to worship ; they will throw them away to the bats and moles .
NCV	Isaiah	2	21	Then the people will hide in caves and cracks in the rocks from the anger of the Lord and his great power , when he stands to shake the earth .

NCV	Isaiah	3	2	the heroes and great soldiers , the judges and prophets , people who do magic and elders ,
NCV	Isaiah	3	4	The Lord says , “ I will cause young boys to be your leaders , and foolish children will rule over you .
NCV	Isaiah	3	5	People will be against each other ; everyone will be against his neighbor . Young people will not respect older people , and common people will not respect important people. ”
NCV	Isaiah	3	6	At that time a man will grab one of his brothers from his own family and say , “ You have a coat , so you will be our leader . These ruins will be under your control. ”
NCV	Isaiah	3	7	But that brother will stand up and say , “ I can not help you , because I do not have food or clothes in my house . You will not make me your leader. ”
NCV	Isaiah	3	8	This will happen because Jerusalem has stumbled , and Judah has fallen . The things they say and do are against the Lord ; they turn against him .
NCV	Isaiah	3	9	The look on their faces shows they are guilty ; like the people of Sodom , they are proud of their sin . They don ’ t care who sees it . How terrible it will be for them , because they have brought much trouble on themselves .
NCV	Isaiah	3	10	Tell those who do what is right that things will go well for them , because they will receive a reward for what they do .

NCV	Isaiah	3	13	The Lord takes his place in court and stands to judge the people .
NCV	Isaiah	3	14	The Lord presents his case against the elders and other leaders of his people : “ You have burned the vineyard . Your houses are full of what you took from the poor .
NCV	Isaiah	3	15	What gives you the right to crush my people and grind the faces of the poor into the dirt ? ” The Lord God All-Powerful says this . A Warning to Women of Jerusalem
NCV	Isaiah	3	16	The Lord says , “ The women of Jerusalem are proud . They walk around with their heads held high , and they flirt with their eyes . They take quick , short steps , making noise with their ankle bracelets. ”
NCV	Isaiah	3	17	So the Lord will put sores on the heads of those women in Jerusalem , and he will make them lose their hair .
NCV	Isaiah	3	18	At that time the Lord will take away everything that makes them proud : their beautiful ankle bracelets , their headbands , their necklaces shaped like the moon ,
NCV	Isaiah	3	19	their earrings , bracelets , and veils ,
NCV	Isaiah	3	20	their scarves , ankle chains , the cloth belts worn around their waists , their bottles of perfume , and charms ,

NCV	Isaiah	4	4	The Lord will wash away the filth from the women of Jerusalem . He will wash the bloodstains out of Jerusalem and clean the city with the spirit of fairness and the spirit of fire .
NCV	Isaiah	4	2	At that time the Lord ’ s branch will be very beautiful and great . The people still living in Israel will be proud of what the land grows .
NCV	Isaiah	4	3	Those who are still living in Jerusalem will be called holy ; their names are recorded among the living in Jerusalem .

NCV	Isaiah	5	5	Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard : I will remove the hedge , and it will be burned . I will break down the stone wall , and it will be walked on .
NCV	Isaiah	5	2	He dug and cleared the field of stones and planted the best grapevines there . He built a tower in the middle of it and cut out a winepress as well . He hoped good grapes would grow there , but only bad ones grew .
NCV	Isaiah	5	3	My friend says , “ You people living in Jerusalem , and you people of Judah , judge between me and my vineyard .
NCV	Isaiah	5	4	What more could I have done for my vineyard than I have already done ? Although I expected good grapes to grow , why were there only bad ones ?
NCV	Isaiah	5	6	I will ruin my field . It will not be trimmed or hoed , and weeds and thorns will grow there . I will command the clouds not to rain on it. ”
NCV	Isaiah	5	7	The vineyard belonging to the Lord All-Powerful is the nation of Israel ; the garden that he loves is the people of Judah . He looked for justice , but there was only killing . He hoped for right living , but there were only cries of pain .
NCV	Isaiah	5	8	How terrible it will be for you who add more houses to your houses and more fields to your fields until there is no room left for other people . Then you are left alone in the land .
NCV	Isaiah	5	9	The Lord All-Powerful said this to me : “ The fine houses will be destroyed ; the large and beautiful houses will be left empty .
NCV	Isaiah	5	10	At that time a ten-acre vineyard will make only six gallons of wine , and ten bushels of seed will grow only half a bushel of grain. ”
NCV	Isaiah	5	11	How terrible it will be for people who rise early in the morning to look for strong drink , who stay awake late at night , becoming drunk with wine .
NCV	Isaiah	5	12	At their parties they have lyres , harps , tambourines , flutes , and wine . They don ’ t see what the Lord has done or notice the work of his hands .
NCV	Isaiah	5	13	So my people will be captured and taken away , because they don ’ t really know me . All the great people will die of hunger , and the common people will die of thirst .
NCV	Isaiah	5	14	So the place of the dead wants more and more people , and it opens wide its mouth . Jerusalem ’ s important people and common people will go down into it , with their happy and noisy ones .
NCV	Isaiah	5	15	So the common people and the great people will be brought down ; those who are proud will be humbled .
NCV	Isaiah	5	16	The Lord All-Powerful will receive glory by judging fairly ; the holy God will show himself holy by doing what is right .
NCV	Isaiah	5	17	Then the sheep will go anywhere they want , and lambs will feed on the land that rich people once owned .
NCV	Isaiah	5	18	How terrible it will be for those people ! They pull their guilt and sins behind them as people pull wagons with ropes .
NCV	Isaiah	5	19	They say , “ Let God hurry ; let him do his work soon so we may see it . Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen soon so that we will know what it is. ”
NCV	Isaiah	5	20	How terrible it will be for people who call good things bad and bad things good , who think darkness is light and light is darkness , who think sour is sweet and sweet is sour .
NCV	Isaiah	5	21	How terrible it will be for people who think they are wise and believe they are clever .
NCV	Isaiah	5	22	How terrible it will be for people who are famous for drinking wine and are champions at mixing drinks .
NCV	Isaiah	5	23	They take money to set the guilty free and don ’ t allow good people to be judged fairly .
NCV	Isaiah	5	24	They will be destroyed just as fire burns straw or dry grass . They will be destroyed like a plant whose roots rot and whose flower dies and blows away like dust . They have refused to obey the teachings of the Lord All-Powerful and have hated the message from the Holy God of Israel .
NCV	Isaiah	5	25	So the Lord has become very angry with his people , and he has raised his hand to punish them . Even the mountains are frightened . Dead bodies lie in the streets like garbage . But the Lord is still angry ; his hand is still raised to strike down the people .
NCV	Isaiah	5	26	He raises a banner for the nations far away . He whistles to call those people from the ends of the earth . Look ! The enemy comes quickly !
NCV	Isaiah	5	27	Not one of them becomes tired or falls down . Not one of them gets sleepy and falls asleep . Their weapons are close at hand , and their sandal straps are not broken .
NCV	Isaiah	5	28	Their arrows are sharp , and all of their bows are ready to shoot . The horses ’ hoofs are hard as rocks , and their chariot wheels move like a whirlwind .
NCV	Isaiah	5	29	Their shout is like the roar of a lion ; it is loud like a young lion . They growl as they grab their captives . There is no one to stop them from taking their captives away .
NCV	Isaiah	5	30	On that day they will roar like the waves of the sea . And when people look at the land , they will see only darkness and pain ; all light will become dark in this thick cloud . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	6	6	One of the heavenly creatures used a pair of tongs to take a hot coal from the altar . Then he flew to me with the hot coal in his hand .
NCV	Isaiah	6	2	Heavenly creatures of fire stood above him . Each creature had six wings : It used two wings to cover its face , two wings to cover its feet , and two wings for flying .
NCV	Isaiah	6	3	Each creature was calling to the others : “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord All-Powerful . His glory fills the whole earth. ”
NCV	Isaiah	6	4	Their calling caused the frame around the door to shake , as the Temple filled with smoke .
NCV	Isaiah	6	5	I said , “ Oh , no ! I will be destroyed . I am not pure , and I live among people who are not pure , but I have seen the King , the Lord All-Powerful. ”
NCV	Isaiah	6	7	The creature touched my mouth with the hot coal and said , “ Look , your guilt is taken away , because this hot coal has touched your lips . Your sin is taken away. ”
NCV	Isaiah	6	8	Then I heard the Lord ’ s voice , saying , “ Whom can I send ? Who will go for us ? ” So I said , “ Here I am . Send me ! ”
NCV	Isaiah	6	9	Then the Lord said , “ Go and tell this to the people : ‘ You will listen and listen , but you will not understand . You will look and look , but you will not learn. ’
NCV	Isaiah	6	10	Make the minds of these people dumb . Shut their ears . Cover their eyes . Otherwise , they might really understand what they see with their eyes and hear with their ears . They might really understand in their minds and come back to me and be healed. ”
NCV	Isaiah	6	11	Then I asked , “ Lord , how long should I do this ? ” He answered , “ Until the cities are destroyed and the people are gone , until there are no people left in the houses , until the land is destroyed and left empty .
NCV	Isaiah	6	12	The Lord will send the people far away , and the land will be left empty .
NCV	Isaiah	6	13	One-tenth of the people will be left in the land , but it will be destroyed again . These people will be like an oak tree whose stump is left when the tree is chopped down . The people who remain will be like a stump that will sprout again. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	7	7	But I , the Lord God , say , “ ‘ Their plan will not succeed ; it will not happen ,
NCV	Isaiah	7	2	Ahaz king of Judah received a message saying , “ The armies of Aram and Israel [ a ] have joined together. ” When Ahaz heard this , he and the people were frightened . They shook with fear like trees of the forest blown by the wind .
NCV	Isaiah	7	3	Then the Lord told Isaiah , “ You and your son Shear-Jashub [ b ] should go and meet Ahaz at the place where the water flows into the upper pool , on the road where people do their laundry .
NCV	Isaiah	7	4	Tell Ahaz , ‘ Be careful . Be calm and don ’ t worry . Don ’ t let those two men , Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah , scare you . Don ’ t be afraid of their anger or Aram ’ s anger , because they are like two barely burning sticks that are ready to go out .
NCV	Isaiah	7	5	They have made plans against you , saying ,
NCV	Isaiah	7	6	“ Let ’ s fight against Judah and tear it apart . We will divide the land for ourselves and make the son of Tabeel the new king of Judah. ”
NCV	Isaiah	7	8	because Aram is led by the city of Damascus , and Damascus is led by its weak king , Rezin . Within sixty-five years Israel will no longer be a nation .
NCV	Isaiah	7	9	Israel is led by the city of Samaria , and Samaria is led by its weak king , the son of Remaliah . If your faith is not strong , you will not have strength enough to last. ’ ” Immanuel—God Is with Us
NCV	Isaiah	7	10	Then the Lord spoke to Ahaz again , saying ,
NCV	Isaiah	7	11	“ Ask for a sign from the Lord your God to prove to yourself that these things are true . It may be a sign from as deep as the place of the dead or as high as the heavens. ”
NCV	Isaiah	7	12	But Ahaz said , “ I will not ask for a sign or test the Lord. ”
NCV	Isaiah	7	13	Then Isaiah said , “ Ahaz , descendant of David , listen carefully ! Isn ’ t it bad enough that you wear out the patience of people ? Do you also have to wear out the patience of my God ?
NCV	Isaiah	7	14	The Lord himself will give you a sign : The virgin [ c ] will be pregnant . She will have a son , and she will name him Immanuel . [ d ]
NCV	Isaiah	7	15	He will be eating milk curds and honey when he learns to reject what is evil and to choose what is good .
NCV	Isaiah	7	16	You are afraid of the kings of Israel and Aram now . But before the child learns to choose good and reject evil , the lands of Israel and Aram will be empty .
NCV	Isaiah	7	17	The Lord will bring troubled times to you , your people , and to the people of your father ’ s family . They will be worse than anything that has happened since Israel separated from Judah . The Lord will bring the king of Assyria to fight against you .
NCV	Isaiah	7	18	“ At that time the Lord will whistle for the Egyptians , and they will come like flies from Egypt ’ s faraway streams . He will call for the Assyrians , and they will come like bees .
NCV	Isaiah	7	19	These enemies will camp in the deep ravines and in the cliffs , by the thornbushes and watering holes .
NCV	Isaiah	7	20	The Lord will hire Assyria and use it like a razor to punish Judah . It will be as if the Lord is shaving the hair from Judah ’ s head and legs and removing Judah ’ s beard .
NCV	Isaiah	7	21	“ At that time a person will be able to keep only one young cow and two sheep alive .
NCV	Isaiah	7	22	There will be only enough milk for that person to eat milk curds . All who remain in the land will go back to eating just milk curds and honey .
NCV	Isaiah	7	23	In this land there are now vineyards that have a thousand grapevines , which are worth about twenty-five pounds of silver . But these fields will become full of weeds and thorns .
NCV	Isaiah	7	24	The land will become wild and useful only as a hunting ground .
NCV	Isaiah	7	25	People once worked and grew food on these hills , but at that time people will not go there , because the land will be filled with weeds and thorns . Only sheep and cattle will go to those places. ” Footnotes - 7:2 Israel Literally , “ Ephraim. ” Isaiah often uses “ Ephraim ” to mean all of Israel . - 7:3 Shear-Jashub This name means “ a part of the people will come back. ” - 7:14 virgin The Hebrew word means “ a young woman. ” Often this meant a girl who was not married and had not yet had sexual relations with anyone . - 7:14 Immanuel This name means “ God is with us. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Isaiah	8	8	That water will flow into Judah and pass through it , rising to Judah ’ s throat . Immanuel , this army will spread its wings like a bird until it covers your whole country. ”
NCV	Isaiah	8	2	I will gather some men to be reliable witnesses : Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah. ”
NCV	Isaiah	8	3	Then I went to the prophetess , and she became pregnant and had a son . The Lord told me , “ Name the boy Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz , [ a ]
NCV	Isaiah	8	4	because the king of Assyria will take away all the wealth and possessions of Damascus and Samaria before the boy learns to say ‘ my father ’ or ‘ my mother. ’ ”
NCV	Isaiah	8	5	Again the Lord spoke to me , saying ,
NCV	Isaiah	8	6	“ These people refuse to accept the slow-moving waters of the pool of Shiloah and are terrified of Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah .
NCV	Isaiah	8	7	So I , the Lord , will bring the king of Assyria and all his power against them , like a powerful flood of water from the Euphrates River . The Assyrians will be like water rising over the banks of the river , flowing over the land .

NCV	Isaiah	8	11	The Lord spoke to me with his great power and warned me not to follow the lead of the rest of the people . He said ,
NCV	Isaiah	8	12	“ People are saying that others make plans against them , but you should not believe them . Don ’ t be afraid of what they fear ; do not dread those things .
NCV	Isaiah	8	13	But remember that the Lord All-Powerful is holy . He is the one you should fear ; he is the one you should dread .
NCV	Isaiah	8	14	Then he will be a place of safety for you . But for the two families of Israel , he will be like a stone that causes people to stumble , like a rock that makes them fall . He will be like a trap for the people of Jerusalem , and he will catch them in his trap .
NCV	Isaiah	8	15	Many people will fall over this rock . They will fall and be broken ; they will be trapped and caught. ”
NCV	Isaiah	8	16	Make an agreement . Seal up the teaching while my followers are watching .
NCV	Isaiah	8	17	I will wait for the Lord to help us , the Lord who is ashamed of the family of Israel . I will wait for him .
NCV	Isaiah	8	18	I am here , and with me are the children the Lord has given me . We are signs and proofs for the people of Israel from the Lord All-Powerful , who lives on Mount Zion .
NCV	Isaiah	8	19	Some people say , “ Ask the mediums and fortune-tellers , who whisper and mutter , what to do. ” But I tell you that people should ask their God for help . Why should people who are still alive ask something from the dead ?
NCV	Isaiah	8	20	You should follow the teachings and the agreement with the Lord . The mediums and fortune-tellers do not speak the word of the Lord , so their words are worth nothing .
NCV	Isaiah	8	21	People will wander through the land troubled and hungry . When they become hungry , they will become angry and will look up and curse their king and their God .
NCV	Isaiah	8	22	They will look around them at their land and see only trouble , darkness , and awful gloom . And they will be forced into the darkness .

NCV	Isaiah	9	12	The Arameans came from the east and the Philistines from the west , and they ate up Israel with their armies . But the Lord was still angry ; his hand was still raised to punish the people .
NCV	Isaiah	9	13	But the people did not return to the one who had struck them ; they did not follow the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Isaiah	9	14	So the Lord cut off Israel ’ s head and tail , taking away both the branch and stalk in one day .
NCV	Isaiah	9	15	The elders and important men were the head , and the prophets who speak lies were the tail .
NCV	Isaiah	9	16	Those who led the people led them in the wrong direction , and those who followed them were destroyed .
NCV	Isaiah	9	17	So the Lord is not happy with the young people , nor will he show mercy to the orphans and widows . All the people are separated from God and are very evil ; they all speak lies . But the Lord is still angry ; his hand is still raised to strike down the people .
NCV	Isaiah	9	18	Evil is like a small fire . First , it burns weeds and thorns . Next , it burns the larger bushes in the forest , and they all go up in a column of smoke .

NCV	Isaiah	10	10	I defeated those kingdoms that worship idols , and those idols were more than the idols of Jerusalem and Samaria .

NCV	Isaiah	10	6	I send it to fight against a nation that is separated from God . I am angry with those people , so I command Assyria to fight against them , to take their wealth from them , to trample them down like dirt in the streets .

NCV	Isaiah	10	12	When the Lord finishes doing what he planned to Mount Zion and Jerusalem , he will punish Assyria . The king of Assyria is very proud , and his pride has made him do these evil things , so God will punish him .
NCV	Isaiah	10	13	The king of Assyria says this : “ By my own power I have done these things ; by my wisdom I have defeated many nations . I have taken their wealth , and , like a mighty one , I have taken their people .
NCV	Isaiah	10	14	I have taken the riches of all these people , like a person reaching into a bird ’ s nest . I have taken these nations , like a person taking eggs . Not one raised a hand or opened its mouth to stop me. ”
NCV	Isaiah	10	15	An ax is not better than the person who swings it . A saw is not better than the one who uses it . A stick can not control the person who picks it up . A club can not pick up the person !
NCV	Isaiah	10	16	So the Lord God All-Powerful will send a terrible disease upon Assyria ’ s soldiers . The strength of Assyria will be burned up like a fire burning until everything is gone .

NCV	Isaiah	10	19	The trees left standing will be so few that even a child could count them .
NCV	Isaiah	10	20	At that time some people will be left alive in Israel from the family of Jacob . They will not continue to depend on the person who defeated them . They will learn truly to depend on the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
NCV	Isaiah	10	21	Those who are left alive in Jacob ’ s family will again follow the powerful God .
NCV	Isaiah	10	22	Israel , your people are many , like the grains of sand by the sea . But only a few of them will be left alive to return to the Lord . God has announced that he will destroy the land completely and fairly .
NCV	Isaiah	10	23	The Lord God All-Powerful will certainly destroy this land , as he has announced .
NCV	Isaiah	10	24	This is what the Lord God All-Powerful says : “ My people living in Jerusalem , don ’ t be afraid of the Assyrians , who beat you with a rod and raise a stick against you , as Egypt did .
NCV	Isaiah	10	25	After a short time my anger against you will stop , and then I will turn my anger to destroying them. ”
NCV	Isaiah	10	26	Then the Lord All-Powerful will beat the Assyrians with a whip as he defeated Midian at the rock of Oreb . He will raise his stick over the waters as he did in Egypt .
NCV	Isaiah	10	27	Then the troubles that Assyria puts on you will be removed , and the load they make you carry will be taken away . Assyria Invades Israel

NCV	Isaiah	23	23	This is a message about Tyre : You trading ships , cry ! The houses and harbor of Tyre are destroyed . This news came to the ships from the land of Cyprus .
NCV	Isaiah	23	2	Be silent , you who live on the island of Tyre ; you merchants of Sidon , be silent . Sailors have made you rich .
NCV	Isaiah	23	3	They traveled the sea to bring grain from Egypt ; the sailors of Tyre brought grain from the Nile Valley and sold it to other nations .
NCV	Isaiah	23	4	Sidon , be ashamed . Strong city of the sea , be ashamed , because the sea says : “ I have not felt the pain of giving birth ; I have not reared young men or women. ”
NCV	Isaiah	23	5	Egypt will hear the news about Tyre , and it will make Egypt hurt with sorrow .
NCV	Isaiah	23	6	You ships should return to Tarshish . You people living near the sea should be sad .
NCV	Isaiah	23	7	Look at your once happy city ! Look at your old , old city ! People from that city have traveled far away to live .
NCV	Isaiah	23	8	Who planned Tyre ’ s destruction ? Tyre made others rich . Its merchants were treated like princes , and its traders were greatly respected .
NCV	Isaiah	23	9	It was the Lord All-Powerful who planned this . He decided to make these proud people unimportant ; he decided to disgrace those who were greatly respected .
NCV	Isaiah	23	10	Go through your land , people of Tarshish , like the Nile goes through Egypt . There is no harbor for you now !
NCV	Isaiah	23	11	The Lord has stretched his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble . He commands that Canaan ’ s strong , walled cities be destroyed .
NCV	Isaiah	23	12	He said , “ Sidon , you will not rejoice any longer , because you are destroyed . Even if you cross the sea to Cyprus , you will not find a place to rest. ”
NCV	Isaiah	23	13	Look at the land of the Babylonians ; it is not a country now . Assyria has made it a place for wild animals . Assyria built towers to attack it ; the soldiers took all the treasures from its cities , and they turned it into ruins .
NCV	Isaiah	23	14	So be sad , you trading ships , because your strong city is destroyed .
NCV	Isaiah	23	15	At that time people will forget about Tyre for seventy years , which is the length of a king ’ s life . After seventy years , Tyre will be like the prostitute in this song :
NCV	Isaiah	23	16	“ Oh woman , you are forgotten . Take your harp and walk through the city . Play your harp well . Sing your song often . Then people will remember you. ”
NCV	Isaiah	23	17	After seventy years the Lord will deal with Tyre , and it will again have trade . It will be like a prostitute for all the nations of the earth .
NCV	Isaiah	23	18	The profits will be saved for the Lord . Tyre will not keep the money she earns but will give them to the people who serve the Lord , so they will have plenty of food and nice clothes . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	24	24	Look ! The Lord will destroy the earth and leave it empty ; he will ruin the surface of the land and scatter its people .
NCV	Isaiah	24	2	At that time the same thing will happen to everyone : to common people and priests , to slaves and masters , to women slaves and their women masters , to buyers and sellers , to those who borrow and those who lend , to bankers and those who owe the bank .
NCV	Isaiah	24	3	The earth will be completely empty . The wealth will all be taken , because the Lord has commanded it .
NCV	Isaiah	24	4	The earth will dry up and die ; the world will grow weak and die ; the great leaders in this land will become weak .
NCV	Isaiah	24	5	The people of the earth have ruined it , because they do not follow God ’ s teachings or obey God ’ s laws or keep their agreement with God that was to last forever .
NCV	Isaiah	24	6	So a curse will destroy the earth . The people of the world are guilty , so they will be burned up ; only a few will be left .
NCV	Isaiah	24	7	The new wine will be bad , and the grapevines will die . People who were happy will be sad .
NCV	Isaiah	24	8	The happy music of the tambourines will end . The happy sounds of wild parties will stop . The joyful music from the harps will end .
NCV	Isaiah	24	9	People will no longer sing while they drink their wine . The beer will taste bitter to those who drink it .
NCV	Isaiah	24	10	The ruined city will be empty , and people will hide behind closed doors .
NCV	Isaiah	24	11	People in the streets will ask for wine , but joy will have turned to sadness ; all the happiness will have left .
NCV	Isaiah	24	12	The city will be left in ruins , and its gates will be smashed to pieces .
NCV	Isaiah	24	13	This is what will happen all over the earth and to all the nations . The earth will be like an olive tree after the harvest or like the few grapes left on a vine after harvest .
NCV	Isaiah	24	14	The people shout for joy . From the west they praise the greatness of the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	24	15	People in the east , praise the Lord . People in the islands of the sea , praise the name of the Lord , the God of Israel .
NCV	Isaiah	24	16	We hear songs from every part of the earth praising God , the Righteous One . But I said , “ I am dying ! I am dying ! How terrible it will be for me ! Traitors turn against people ; with their dishonesty , they turn against people. ”
NCV	Isaiah	24	17	There are terrors , holes , and traps for the people of the earth .
NCV	Isaiah	24	18	Anyone who tries to escape from the sound of terror will fall into a hole . Anyone who climbs out of the hole will be caught in a trap . The clouds in the sky will pour out rain , and the foundations of the earth will shake .
NCV	Isaiah	24	19	The earth will be broken up ; the earth will split open ; the earth will shake violently .
NCV	Isaiah	24	20	The earth will stumble around like someone who is drunk ; it will shake like a hut in a storm . Its sin is like a heavy weight on its back ; it will fall and never rise again .
NCV	Isaiah	24	21	At that time the Lord will punish the powers in the sky above and the rulers on earth below .
NCV	Isaiah	24	22	They will be gathered together like prisoners thrown into a dungeon ; they will be shut up in prison . After much time they will be punished .
NCV	Isaiah	24	23	The moon will be embarrassed , and the sun will be ashamed , because the Lord All-Powerful will rule as king on Mount Zion in Jerusalem . Jerusalem ’ s leaders will see his greatness . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	25	25	Lord , you are my God . I honor you and praise you , because you have done amazing things . You have always done what you said you would do ; you have done what you planned long ago .
NCV	Isaiah	25	2	You have made the city a pile of rocks and have destroyed her walls . The city our enemies built with strong walls is gone ; it will never be built again .
NCV	Isaiah	25	3	People from powerful nations will honor you ; cruel people from strong cities will fear you .
NCV	Isaiah	25	4	You protect the poor ; you protect the helpless when they are in danger . You are like a shelter from storms , like shade that protects them from the heat . The cruel people attack like a rainstorm beating against the wall ,
NCV	Isaiah	25	5	like the heat in the desert . But you , God , stop their violent attack . As a cloud cools a hot day , you silence the songs of those who have no mercy . God ’ s Banquet for His Servants
NCV	Isaiah	25	6	The Lord All-Powerful will prepare a feast on this mountain for all people . It will be a feast with all the best food and wine , the finest meat and wine .
NCV	Isaiah	25	7	On this mountain God will destroy the veil that covers all nations , the veil that stretches over all peoples ;
NCV	Isaiah	25	8	he will destroy death forever . The Lord God will wipe away every tear from every face . He will take away the shame of his people from the earth . The Lord has spoken .
NCV	Isaiah	25	9	At that time people will say , “ Our God is doing this ! We have waited for him , and he has come to save us . This is the Lord . We waited for him , so we will rejoice and be happy when he saves us. ”
NCV	Isaiah	25	10	The Lord will protect Jerusalem , but he will crush our enemy Moab like straw that is trampled down in the manure .
NCV	Isaiah	25	11	They will spread their arms in it like a person who is swimming . But God will bring down their pride , and all the clever things they have made will mean nothing .

NCV	Isaiah	26	26	At that time people will sing this song in Judah : We have a strong city . God protects us with its strong walls and defenses .
NCV	Isaiah	26	2	Open the gates , and the good people will enter , those who follow God .
NCV	Isaiah	26	3	You , Lord , give true peace to those who depend on you , because they trust you .
NCV	Isaiah	26	4	So , trust the Lord always , because he is our Rock forever .
NCV	Isaiah	26	5	He will destroy the proud city , and he will punish the people living there . He will bring that high city down to the ground and throw it down into the dust .
NCV	Isaiah	26	6	Then those who were hurt by the city will walk on its ruins ; those who were made poor by the city will trample it under their feet .
NCV	Isaiah	26	7	The path of life is level for those who are right with God ; Lord , you make the way of life smooth for those people .
NCV	Isaiah	26	8	But , Lord , we are waiting for your way of justice . Our souls want to remember you and your name .
NCV	Isaiah	26	9	My soul wants to be with you at night , and my spirit wants to be with you at the dawn of every day . When your way of justice comes to the land , people of the world will learn the right way of living .
NCV	Isaiah	26	10	Evil people will not learn to do good even if you show them kindness . They will continue doing evil , even if they live in a good world ; they never see the Lord ’ s greatness .
NCV	Isaiah	26	11	Lord , you are ready to punish those people , but they do not see that . Show them your strong love for your people . Then those who are evil will be ashamed . Burn them in the fire you have prepared for your enemies .
NCV	Isaiah	26	12	Lord , all our success is because of what you have done , so give us peace .
NCV	Isaiah	26	13	Lord , our God , other masters besides you have ruled us , but we honor only you .
NCV	Isaiah	26	14	Those masters are now dead ; their ghosts will not rise from death . You punished and destroyed them and erased any memory of them .
NCV	Isaiah	26	15	Lord , you multiplied the number of your people ; you multiplied them and brought honor to yourself . You made the borders of the land wide .
NCV	Isaiah	26	16	Lord , people remember you when they are in trouble ; they say quiet prayers to you when you punish them .
NCV	Isaiah	26	17	Lord , when we are with you , we are like a woman giving birth to a baby ; she cries and has pain from the birth .
NCV	Isaiah	26	18	In the same way , we had pain . We gave birth , but only to wind . We don ’ t bring salvation to the land or make new people for the world .
NCV	Isaiah	26	19	Your people have died , but they will live again ; their bodies will rise from death . You who lie in the ground , wake up and be happy ! The dew covering you is like the dew of a new day ; the ground will give birth to the dead . Judgment : Reward or Punishment
NCV	Isaiah	26	20	My people , go into your rooms and shut your doors behind you . Hide in your rooms for a short time until God ’ s anger is finished .

NCV	Isaiah	27	27	At that time the Lord will punish Leviathan , the gliding snake . He will punish Leviathan , the coiled snake , with his great and hard and powerful sword . He will kill the monster in the sea .
NCV	Isaiah	27	2	At that time people will sing about the pleasant vineyard .
NCV	Isaiah	27	3	“ I , the Lord , will care for that vineyard ; I will water it at the right time . No one will hurt it , because I will guard it day and night .
NCV	Isaiah	27	4	I am not angry . If anyone builds a wall of thornbushes in war , I will march to it and burn it .
NCV	Isaiah	27	5	But if anyone comes to me for safety and wants to make peace with me , he should come and make peace with me. ”
NCV	Isaiah	27	6	In the days to come , the people of Jacob will be like a plant with good roots ; Israel will grow like a plant beginning to bloom . Then the world will be filled with their children . The Lord Will Send Israel Away
NCV	Isaiah	27	7	The Lord has not hurt his people as he hurt their enemies ; his people have not been killed like those who tried to kill them .
NCV	Isaiah	27	8	He will settle his argument with Israel by sending it far away . Like a hot desert wind , he will drive it away .
NCV	Isaiah	27	9	This is how Israel ’ s guilt will be forgiven ; this is how its sins will be taken away : Israel will crush the rocks of the altar to dust , and no statues or altars will be left standing for the Asherah idols .
NCV	Isaiah	27	10	At that time the strong , walled city will be empty like a desert . Calves will eat grass there . They will lie down there and eat leaves from the branches .
NCV	Isaiah	27	11	The limbs will become dry and break off , so women will use them for firewood . The people refuse to understand , so God will not comfort them ; their Maker will not be kind to them .
NCV	Isaiah	27	12	At that time the Lord will begin gathering his people one by one from the Euphrates River to the brook of Egypt . He will separate them from others as grain is separated from chaff .
NCV	Isaiah	27	13	Many of my people are now lost in Assyria . Some have run away to Egypt . But at that time a great trumpet will be blown , and all those people will come and worship the Lord on that holy mountain in Jerusalem . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Isaiah	27	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Isaiah	28	28	The grain is ground to make bread . People do not ruin it by crushing it forever . The farmer separates the wheat from the chaff with his cart , but he does not let his horses grind it .
NCV	Isaiah	28	2	Look , the Lord has someone who is strong and powerful . Like a storm of hail and strong wind , like a sudden flood of water pouring over the country , he will throw Samaria down to the ground .
NCV	Isaiah	28	3	That city , the pride of Israel ’ s drunken people , will be trampled underfoot .
NCV	Isaiah	28	4	That beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant set on a hill above a rich valley . That city will be like the first fig of summer . Anyone who sees it quickly picks it and eats it .
NCV	Isaiah	28	5	At that time the Lord All-Powerful will be like a beautiful crown , like a wonderful crown of flowers for his people who are left alive .
NCV	Isaiah	28	6	Then he will give wisdom to the judges who must decide cases and strength to those who battle at the city gate .
NCV	Isaiah	28	7	But now those leaders are drunk with wine ; they stumble from drinking too much beer . The priests and prophets are drunk with beer and are filled with wine . They stumble from too much beer . The prophets are drunk when they see their visions ; the judges stumble when they make their decisions .
NCV	Isaiah	28	8	Every table is covered with vomit , so there is not a clean place anywhere .
NCV	Isaiah	28	9	The Lord is trying to teach the people a lesson ; he is trying to make them understand his teachings . But the people are like babies too old for breast milk , like those who no longer nurse at their mother ’ s breast .
NCV	Isaiah	28	10	So they make fun of the Lord ’ s prophet and say : “ A command here , a command there . A rule here , a rule there . A little lesson here , a little lesson there. ”
NCV	Isaiah	28	11	So the Lord will use strange words and foreign languages to speak to these people .
NCV	Isaiah	28	12	God said to them , “ Here is a place of rest ; let the tired people come and rest . This is the place of peace. ” But the people would not listen .
NCV	Isaiah	28	13	So the words of the Lord will be , “ A command here , a command there . A rule here , a rule there . A little lesson here , a little lesson there. ” They will fall back and be defeated ; they will be trapped and captured .
NCV	Isaiah	28	14	So listen to the Lord ’ s message , you who brag , you leaders in Jerusalem .
NCV	Isaiah	28	15	You say , “ We have made an agreement with death ; we have a contract with death . When terrible punishment passes by , it won ’ t hurt us . Our lies will keep us safe , and our tricks will hide us. ”
NCV	Isaiah	28	16	Because of these things , this is what the Lord God says : “ I will put a stone in the ground in Jerusalem , a tested stone . Everything will be built on this important and precious rock . Anyone who trusts in it will never be disappointed .
NCV	Isaiah	28	17	I will use justice as a measuring line and goodness as the standard . The lies you hide behind will be destroyed as if by hail . They will be washed away as if in a flood .
NCV	Isaiah	28	18	Your agreement with death will be erased ; your contract with death will not help you . When terrible punishment comes , you will be crushed by it .
NCV	Isaiah	28	19	Whenever punishment comes , it will take you away . It will come morning after morning ; it will defeat you by day and by night . Those who understand this punishment will be terrified. ”
NCV	Isaiah	28	20	You will be like the person who tried to sleep on a bed that was too short and with a blanket that was too narrow to wrap around himself .
NCV	Isaiah	28	21	The Lord will fight as he did at Mount Perazim . He will be angry as he was in the Valley of Gibeon . He will do his work , his strange work . He will finish his job , his strange job .
NCV	Isaiah	28	22	Now , you must not make fun of these things , or the ropes around you will become tighter . The Lord God All-Powerful has told me how the whole earth will be destroyed . The Lord Punishes Fairly
NCV	Isaiah	28	23	Listen closely to what I tell you ; listen carefully to what I say .
NCV	Isaiah	28	24	A farmer does not plow his field all the time ; he does not go on working the soil .
NCV	Isaiah	28	25	He makes the ground flat and smooth . Then he plants the dill and scatters the cumin . He plants the wheat in rows , the barley in its special place , and other wheat as a border around the field .
NCV	Isaiah	28	26	His God teaches him and shows him the right way .
NCV	Isaiah	28	27	A farmer doesn ’ t use heavy boards to crush dill ; he doesn ’ t use a wagon wheel to crush cumin . He uses a small stick to break open the dill , and with a stick he opens the cumin .

NCV	Isaiah	28	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Isaiah	29	29	How terrible it will be for you , Jerusalem , the city where David camped . Your festivals have continued year after year .
NCV	Isaiah	29	2	I will attack Jerusalem , and that city will be filled with sadness and crying . It will be like an altar to me .
NCV	Isaiah	29	3	I will put armies all around you , Jerusalem ; I will surround you with towers and with devices to attack you .
NCV	Isaiah	29	4	You will be pulled down and will speak from the ground ; I will hear your voice rising from the ground . It will sound like the voice of a ghost ; your words will come like a whisper from the dirt .
NCV	Isaiah	29	5	Your many enemies will become like fine dust ; the many cruel people will be like chaff that is blown away . Everything will happen very quickly .
NCV	Isaiah	29	6	The Lord All-Powerful will come with thunder , earthquakes , and great noises , with storms , strong winds , and a fire that destroys .
NCV	Isaiah	29	7	Then all the nations that fight against Jerusalem will be like a dream ; all the nations that attack her will be like a vision in the night .
NCV	Isaiah	29	8	They will be like a hungry man who dreams he is eating , but when he awakens , he is still hungry . They will be like a thirsty man who dreams he is drinking , but when he awakens , he is still weak and thirsty . It will be the same way with all the nations who fight against Mount Zion .
NCV	Isaiah	29	9	Be surprised and amazed . Blind yourselves so that you can not see . Become drunk , but not from wine . Trip and fall , but not from beer .
NCV	Isaiah	29	10	The Lord has made you go into a deep sleep . He has closed your eyes . ( The prophets are your eyes . ) He has covered your heads . ( The seers are your heads . )
NCV	Isaiah	29	11	This vision is like the words of a book that is closed and sealed . You may give the book to someone who can read and tell that person to read it . But he will say , “ I can ’ t read the book , because it is sealed. ”
NCV	Isaiah	29	12	Or you may give the book to someone who can not read and tell him to read it . But he will say , “ I don ’ t know how to read. ”
NCV	Isaiah	29	13	The Lord says : “ These people worship me with their mouths , and honor me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me . Their worship is based on nothing but human rules .
NCV	Isaiah	29	14	So I will continue to amaze these people by doing more and more miracles . Their wise men will lose their wisdom ; their wise men will not be able to understand. ” Warnings About Other Nations
NCV	Isaiah	29	15	How terrible it will be for those who try to hide things from the Lord and who do their work in darkness . They think no one will see them or know what they do .
NCV	Isaiah	29	16	You are confused . You think the clay is equal to the potter . You think that an object can tell the one who made it , “ You didn ’ t make me. ” This is like a pot telling its maker , “ You don ’ t know anything. ” A Better Time Is Coming
NCV	Isaiah	29	17	In a very short time , Lebanon will become rich farmland , and the rich farmland will seem like a forest .
NCV	Isaiah	29	18	At that time the deaf will hear the words in a book . Instead of having darkness and gloom , the blind will see .
NCV	Isaiah	29	19	The Lord will make the poor people happy ; they will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
NCV	Isaiah	29	20	Then the people without mercy will come to an end ; those who do not respect God will disappear . Those who enjoy doing evil will be gone :
NCV	Isaiah	29	21	those who lie about others in court , those who trap people in court , those who lie and take justice from innocent people in court .
NCV	Isaiah	29	22	This is what the Lord who set Abraham free says to the family of Jacob : “ Now the people of Jacob will not be ashamed or disgraced any longer .
NCV	Isaiah	29	23	When they see all their children , the children I made with my hands , they will say my name is holy . They will agree that the Holy One of Jacob is holy , and they will respect the God of Israel .

NCV	Isaiah	30	30	The Lord will cause all people to hear his great voice and to see his powerful arm come down with anger , like a great fire that burns everything , like a great storm with much rain and hail .
NCV	Isaiah	30	2	They go down to Egypt for help without asking me about it first . They hope they will be saved by the king of Egypt ; they want Egypt to protect them .
NCV	Isaiah	30	3	But hiding in Egypt will bring you only shame ; Egypt ’ s protection will only disappoint you .
NCV	Isaiah	30	4	Your officers have gone to Zoan , and your messengers have gone to Hanes ,
NCV	Isaiah	30	5	but they will be put to shame , because Egypt is useless to them . It will give no help and will be of no use ; it will cause them only shame and embarrassment. ” God ’ s Message to Judah
NCV	Isaiah	30	6	This is a message about the animals in southern Judah : Southern Judah is a dangerous place full of lions and lionesses , poisonous snakes and darting snakes . The messengers travel through there with their wealth on the backs of donkeys and their treasure on the backs of camels . They carry them to a nation that can not help them ,
NCV	Isaiah	30	7	to Egypt whose help is useless . So I call that country Rahab the Do-Nothing .
NCV	Isaiah	30	8	Now write this on a sign for the people , write this on a scroll , so that for the days to come this will be a witness forever .
NCV	Isaiah	30	9	These people are like children who lie and refuse to obey ; they refuse to listen to the Lord ’ s teachings .
NCV	Isaiah	30	10	They tell the seers , “ Don ’ t see any more visions ! ” They say to the prophets , “ Don ’ t tell us the truth ! Say things that will make us feel good ; see only good things for us .
NCV	Isaiah	30	11	Stop blocking our path . Get out of our way . Stop telling us about God , the Holy One of Israel. ”
NCV	Isaiah	30	12	So this is what the Holy One of Israel says : “ You people have refused to accept this message and have depended on cruelty and lies to help you .
NCV	Isaiah	30	13	You are guilty of these things . So you will be like a high wall with cracks in it that falls suddenly and breaks into small pieces .
NCV	Isaiah	30	14	You will be like a clay jar that breaks , smashed into many pieces . Those pieces will be too small to take coals from the fire or to get water from a well. ”
NCV	Isaiah	30	15	This is what the Lord God , the Holy One of Israel , says : “ If you come back to me and trust me , you will be saved . If you will be calm and trust me , you will be strong. ” But you don ’ t want to do that .
NCV	Isaiah	30	16	You say , “ No , we need horses to run away on. ” So you will run away on horses . You say , “ We will ride away on fast horses. ” So those who chase you will be fast .
NCV	Isaiah	30	17	One enemy will make threats , and a thousand of your men will run away . Five enemies will make threats , and all of you will run from them . You will be left alone like a flagpole on a hilltop , like a banner on a hill .
NCV	Isaiah	30	18	The Lord wants to show his mercy to you . He wants to rise and comfort you . The Lord is a fair God , and everyone who waits for his help will be happy . The Lord Will Help His People
NCV	Isaiah	30	19	You people who live on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will not cry anymore . The Lord will hear your crying , and he will comfort you . When he hears you , he will help you .
NCV	Isaiah	30	20	The Lord has given you sorrow and hurt like the bread and water you ate every day . He is your teacher ; he will not continue to hide from you , but you will see your teacher with your own eyes .
NCV	Isaiah	30	21	If you go the wrong way—to the right or to the left—you will hear a voice behind you saying , “ This is the right way . You should go this way. ”
NCV	Isaiah	30	22	You have statues covered with silver and gold , but you will ruin them for further use . You will throw them away like filthy rags and say , “ Go away ! ”
NCV	Isaiah	30	23	At that time the Lord will send rain for the seeds you plant in the ground , and the ground will grow food for you . The harvest will be rich and great , and you will have plenty of food in the fields for your animals .
NCV	Isaiah	30	24	Your oxen and donkeys that work the soil will have all the food they need . You will have to use shovels and pitchforks to spread all their food .
NCV	Isaiah	30	25	Every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water . These things will happen after many people are killed and the towers are pulled down .
NCV	Isaiah	30	26	At that time the light from the moon will be bright like the sun , and the light from the sun will be seven times brighter than now , like the light of seven days . These things will happen when the Lord bandages his broken people and heals the hurts he gave them .
NCV	Isaiah	30	27	Look ! The Lord comes from far away . His anger is like a fire with thick clouds of smoke . His mouth is filled with anger , and his tongue is like a burning fire .
NCV	Isaiah	30	28	His breath is like a rushing river , which rises to the throat . He will judge the nations as if he is sifting them through the strainer of destruction . He will place in their mouths a bit that will lead them the wrong way .
NCV	Isaiah	30	29	You will sing happy songs as on the nights you begin a festival . You will be happy like people listening to flutes as they come to the mountain of the Lord , to the Rock of Israel .
NCV	Isaiah	30	31	Assyria will be afraid when it hears the voice of the Lord , because he will strike Assyria with a rod .
NCV	Isaiah	30	32	When the Lord punishes Assyria with a rod , he will beat them to the music of tambourines and harps ; he will fight against them with his mighty weapons .
NCV	Isaiah	30	33	Topheth [ a ] has been made ready for a long time ; it is ready for the king . It was made deep and wide with much wood and fire .

NCV	Isaiah	31	31	How terrible it will be for those people who go down to Egypt for help . They think horses will save them . They think their many chariots and strong horsemen will save them . But they don ’ t trust God , the Holy One of Israel , or ask the Lord for help .
NCV	Isaiah	31	2	But he is wise and can bring them disaster . He does not change his warnings . He will rise up and fight against the evil people and against those who try to help evil people .
NCV	Isaiah	31	3	The Egyptians are only people and are not God . Their horses are only animals and are not spirit . The Lord will stretch out his arm , and the one who helps will stumble , and the people who wanted help will fall . All of them will be destroyed together .
NCV	Isaiah	31	4	The Lord says this to me : “ When a lion or a lion ’ s cub kills an animal to eat , it stands over the dead animal and roars . A band of shepherds may be assembled against it , but the lion will not be afraid of their yelling or upset by their noise . So the Lord All-Powerful will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill .
NCV	Isaiah	31	5	The Lord All-Powerful will defend Jerusalem like birds flying over their nests . He will defend and save it ; he will ‘ pass over ’ and save Jerusalem. ”
NCV	Isaiah	31	6	You children of Israel , come back to the God you fought against .
NCV	Isaiah	31	7	The time is coming when each of you will stop worshiping idols of gold and silver , which you sinned by making .
NCV	Isaiah	31	8	“ Assyria will be defeated by a sword , but not the sword of a person ; Assyria will be destroyed , but not by a person ’ s sword . Assyria will run away from the sword of God , but its young men will be caught and made slaves .
NCV	Isaiah	31	9	They will panic , and their protection will be destroyed . Their commanders will be terrified when they see God ’ s battle flag , ” says the Lord , whose fire is in Jerusalem and whose furnace is in Jerusalem . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	32	32	A king will rule in a way that brings justice , and leaders will make fair decisions .
NCV	Isaiah	32	2	Then each ruler will be like a shelter from the wind , like a safe place in a storm , like streams of water in a dry land , like a cool shadow from a large rock in a hot land .
NCV	Isaiah	32	3	People will look to the king for help , and they will truly listen to what he says .
NCV	Isaiah	32	4	People who are now worried will be able to understand . Those who can not speak clearly now will then be able to speak clearly and quickly .
NCV	Isaiah	32	5	Fools will not be called great , and people will not respect the wicked .
NCV	Isaiah	32	6	A fool says foolish things , and in his mind he plans evil . A fool does things that are wicked , and he says wrong things about the Lord . A fool does not feed the hungry or let thirsty people drink water .
NCV	Isaiah	32	7	The wicked person uses evil like a tool . He plans ways to take everything from the poor . He destroys the poor with lies , even when the poor person is in the right .
NCV	Isaiah	32	8	But a good leader plans to do good , and those good things make him a good leader . Hard Times Are Coming
NCV	Isaiah	32	9	You women who are calm now , stand up and listen to me . You women who feel safe now , hear what I say .
NCV	Isaiah	32	10	You women feel safe now , but after one year you will be afraid . There will be no grape harvest and no summer fruit to gather .
NCV	Isaiah	32	11	Women , you are calm now , but you should shake with fear . Women , you feel safe now , but you should tremble . Take off your nice clothes and put rough cloth around your waist to show your sadness .
NCV	Isaiah	32	12	Beat your breasts in grief , because the fields that were pleasant are now empty . Cry , because the vines that once had fruit now have no more grapes .
NCV	Isaiah	32	13	Cry for the land of my people , in which only thorns and weeds now grow . Cry for the city that once was happy and for all the houses that once were filled with joy .
NCV	Isaiah	32	14	The palace will be empty ; people will leave the noisy city . Strong cities and towers will be empty . Wild donkeys will love to live there , and sheep will go there to eat . Things Will Get Better
NCV	Isaiah	32	15	This will continue until God pours his Spirit from above upon us . Then the desert will be like a fertile field and the fertile field like a forest .
NCV	Isaiah	32	16	Justice will be found even in the desert , and fairness will be found in the fertile fields .
NCV	Isaiah	32	17	That fairness will bring peace , and it will bring calm and safety forever .
NCV	Isaiah	32	18	My people will live in peaceful places and in safe homes and in calm places of rest .
NCV	Isaiah	32	19	Hail will destroy the forest , and the city will be completely destroyed .

NCV	Isaiah	33	33	How terrible it will be for you who destroy others but have not been destroyed yet . How terrible it will be for you , traitor , whom no one has turned against yet . When you stop destroying , others will destroy you . When you stop turning against others , they will turn against you .
NCV	Isaiah	33	2	Lord , be kind to us . We have waited for your help . Give us strength every morning . Save us when we are in trouble .
NCV	Isaiah	33	3	Your powerful voice makes people run away in fear ; your greatness causes the nations to run away .
NCV	Isaiah	33	4	Like locusts , your enemies will take away the things you stole in war . Like locusts rushing about , they will take your wealth .
NCV	Isaiah	33	5	The Lord is very great , and he lives in a high place . He fills Jerusalem with fairness and justice .
NCV	Isaiah	33	6	He will be your safety . He is full of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge . Respect for the Lord is the greatest treasure .
NCV	Isaiah	33	7	See , brave people are crying out in the streets ; those who tried to bring peace are weeping loudly .
NCV	Isaiah	33	8	There is no one on the roads , no one walking in the paths . People have broken the agreements they made . They refuse to believe the proof from witnesses . No one respects other people .
NCV	Isaiah	33	9	The land is sick and dying ; Lebanon is ashamed and dying . The Plain of Sharon is dry like the desert , and the trees of Bashan and Carmel are dying .
NCV	Isaiah	33	10	The Lord says , “ Now , I will stand up and show my greatness . Now , I will become important to the people .
NCV	Isaiah	33	11	You people do useless things that are like hay and straw . A destructive wind will burn you like fire .
NCV	Isaiah	33	12	People will be burned until their bones become like lime ; they will burn quickly like dry thornbushes. ”
NCV	Isaiah	33	13	You people in faraway lands , hear what I have done . You people who are near me , learn about my power .
NCV	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Jerusalem are afraid ; those who are separated from God shake with fear . They say , “ Can any of us live through this fire that destroys ? Who can live near this fire that burns on and on ? ”
NCV	Isaiah	33	15	A person who does what is right and speaks what is right , who refuses to take money unfairly , who refuses to take money to hurt others , who does not listen to plans of murder , who refuses to think about evil—
NCV	Isaiah	33	16	this is the kind of person who will be safe . He will be protected as he would be in a high , walled city . He will always have bread , and he will not run out of water .
NCV	Isaiah	33	17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty . You will see the land that stretches far away .
NCV	Isaiah	33	18	You will think about the terror of the past : “ Where is that officer ? Where is the one who collected the taxes ? Where is the officer in charge of our defense towers ? ”
NCV	Isaiah	33	19	No longer will you see those proud people from other countries , whose strange language you couldn ’ t understand . God Will Protect Jerusalem
NCV	Isaiah	33	20	Look at Jerusalem , the city of our festivals . Look at Jerusalem , that beautiful place of rest . It is like a tent that will never be moved ; the pegs that hold her in place will never be pulled up , and her ropes will never be broken .
NCV	Isaiah	33	21	There the Lord will be our Mighty One . That land is a place with streams and wide rivers , but there will be no enemy boats on those rivers ; no powerful ship will sail on them .
NCV	Isaiah	33	22	This is because the Lord is our judge . The Lord makes our laws . The Lord is our king . He will save us .
NCV	Isaiah	33	23	You sailors from other lands , hear : The ropes on your boats hang loose . The mast is not held firm . The sails are not spread open . Then your great wealth will be divided . There will be so much wealth that even the crippled people will carry off a share .

NCV	Isaiah	34	2	The Lord is angry with all the nations ; he is angry with their armies . He will destroy them and kill them all .
NCV	Isaiah	34	3	Their bodies will be thrown outside . The stink will rise from the bodies , and the blood will flow down the mountains .
NCV	Isaiah	34	4	The sun , moon , and stars will dissolve , and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll . The stars will fall like dead leaves from a vine or dried-up figs from a fig tree .
NCV	Isaiah	34	5	The Lord ’ s sword in the sky is covered with blood . It will cut through Edom and destroy those people as an offering to the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	34	6	The Lord ’ s sword will be covered with blood ; it will be covered with fat , with the blood from lambs and goats , with the fat from the kidneys of sheep . This is because the Lord decided there will be a sacrifice in Bozrah and much killing in Edom .

NCV	Isaiah	34	11	Birds and small animals will own that land , and owls and ravens will live there . God will make it an empty wasteland ; it will have nothing left in it .
NCV	Isaiah	34	12	The important people will have no one left to rule them ; the leaders will all be gone .
NCV	Isaiah	34	13	Thorns will take over the strong towers , and wild bushes will grow in the walled cities . It will be a home for wild dogs and a place for owls to live .
NCV	Isaiah	34	14	Desert animals will live with the hyenas , and wild goats will call to their friends . Night animals will live there and find a place of rest .

NCV	Isaiah	36	36	During Hezekiah ’ s fourteenth year as king , Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the strong , walled cities of Judah and captured them .
NCV	Isaiah	36	2	The king of Assyria sent out his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem . When the commander came near the waterway from the upper pool on the road where people do their laundry , he stopped .
NCV	Isaiah	36	3	Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah went out to meet him . Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager , Shebna was the royal secretary , and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder .
NCV	Isaiah	36	4	The field commander said to them , “ Tell Hezekiah this : “ ‘ The great king , the king of Assyria , says : What can you trust in now ?
NCV	Isaiah	36	5	You say you have battle plans and power for war , but your words mean nothing . Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me ?
NCV	Isaiah	36	6	Look , you are depending on Egypt to help you , but Egypt is like a splintered walking stick . If you lean on it for help , it will stab your hand and hurt you . The king of Egypt will hurt all those who depend on him .
NCV	Isaiah	36	7	You might say , “ We are depending on the Lord our God , ” but Hezekiah destroyed the Lord ’ s altars and the places of worship . Hezekiah told Judah and Jerusalem , “ You must worship only at this one altar. ”
NCV	Isaiah	36	8	“ ‘ Now make an agreement with my master , the king of Assyria : I will give you two thousand horses if you can find enough men to ride them .
NCV	Isaiah	36	9	You can not defeat one of my master ’ s least important officers , so why do you depend on Egypt to give you chariots and horsemen ?
NCV	Isaiah	36	10	I have not come to attack and destroy this country without an order from the Lord . The Lord himself told me to come to this country and destroy it. ’ ”
NCV	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the field commander , “ Please speak to us in the Aramaic language . We understand it . Don ’ t speak to us in Hebrew , because the people on the city wall can hear you. ”
NCV	Isaiah	36	12	But the commander said , “ My master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king . He sent me to speak also to those people sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you. ”
NCV	Isaiah	36	13	Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language , “ Listen to what the great king , the king of Assyria says ,
NCV	Isaiah	36	14	The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you , because he can ’ t save you .
NCV	Isaiah	36	15	Don ’ t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting the Lord by saying , ‘ The Lord will surely save us . This city won ’ t be handed over to the king of Assyria. ’
NCV	Isaiah	36	16	“ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah . The king of Assyria says , ‘ Make peace with me , and come out of the city to me . Then everyone will be free to eat the fruit from his own grapevine and fig tree and to drink water from his own well .
NCV	Isaiah	36	17	After that I will come and take you to a land like your own—a land with grain and new wine , bread and vineyards. ’
NCV	Isaiah	36	18	“ Don ’ t let Hezekiah fool you , saying , ‘ The Lord will save us. ’ Has a god of any other nation saved his people from the power of the king of Assyria ?
NCV	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? They did not save Samaria from my power .
NCV	Isaiah	36	20	Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me . Neither can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power. ”
NCV	Isaiah	36	21	The people were silent . They didn ’ t answer the commander at all , because King Hezekiah had ordered , “ Don ’ t answer him. ”
NCV	Isaiah	36	22	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah tore their clothes to show how upset they were . ( Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager , Shebna was the royal secretary , and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder . ) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said .

NCV	Isaiah	37	37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria left and went back to Nineveh and stayed there .
NCV	Isaiah	37	2	Hezekiah sent Eliakim , the palace manager , and Shebna , the royal secretary , and the older priests to Isaiah . They were all wearing rough cloth when they came to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz .
NCV	Isaiah	37	3	They told Isaiah , “ This is what Hezekiah says : Today is a day of sorrow and punishment and disgrace , as when a child should be born , but the mother is not strong enough to give birth to it .
NCV	Isaiah	37	4	The king of Assyria sent his field commander to make fun of the living God . Maybe the Lord your God will hear what the commander said and will punish him for it . So pray for the few of us who are left alive. ”
NCV	Isaiah	37	5	When Hezekiah ’ s officers came to Isaiah ,
NCV	Isaiah	37	6	he said to them , “ Tell your master this : The Lord says , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of what you have heard . Don ’ t be frightened by the words the servants of the king of Assyria have spoken against me .
NCV	Isaiah	37	7	Listen ! I am going to put a spirit in the king of Assyria . He will hear a report that will make him return to his own country , and I will cause him to die by the sword there. ’ ”
NCV	Isaiah	37	8	The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish . When he went back , he found the king fighting against the city of Libnah .
NCV	Isaiah	37	9	The king received a report that Tirhakah , the Cushite king of Egypt , was coming to attack him . When the king of Assyria heard this , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
NCV	Isaiah	37	10	“ Tell Hezekiah king of Judah : Don ’ t be fooled by the god you trust . Don ’ t believe him when he says Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria .
NCV	Isaiah	37	11	You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done . They have completely defeated every country , so do not think you will be saved .
NCV	Isaiah	37	12	Did the gods of those people save them ? My ancestors destroyed them , defeating the cities of Gozan , Haran , and Rezeph , and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar .
NCV	Isaiah	37	13	Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the kings of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? ” Hezekiah Prays to the Lord
NCV	Isaiah	37	14	When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it , he went up to the Temple of the Lord . He spread the letter out before the Lord
NCV	Isaiah	37	15	and prayed to the Lord :
NCV	Isaiah	37	16	“ Lord All-Powerful , you are the God of Israel , whose throne is between the gold creatures with wings , only you are God of all the kingdoms of the earth . You made the heavens and the earth .
NCV	Isaiah	37	17	Hear , Lord , and listen . Open your eyes , Lord , and see . Listen to all the words Sennacherib has said to insult the living God .
NCV	Isaiah	37	18	“ It is true , Lord , that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these countries and their lands .
NCV	Isaiah	37	19	They have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire , but they were only wood and rock statues that people made . So the kings have destroyed them .
NCV	Isaiah	37	20	Now , Lord our God , save us from the king ’ s power so that all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you , Lord , are the only God. ” The Lord Answers Hezekiah
NCV	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah that said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You prayed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria .
NCV	Isaiah	37	22	So this is what the Lord has said against Sennacherib : The people of Jerusalem hate you and make fun of you ; the people of Jerusalem laugh at you as you run away .
NCV	Isaiah	37	23	You have insulted me and spoken against me ; you have raised your voice against me . You have a proud look on your face , which is against me , the Holy One of Israel !
NCV	Isaiah	37	24	You have sent your messengers to insult the Lord . You have said , “ With my many chariots I have gone to the tops of the mountains , to the highest mountains of Lebanon . I have cut down its tallest cedars and its best pine trees . I have gone to its greatest heights and its best forests .
NCV	Isaiah	37	25	I have dug wells in foreign countries and drunk water there . By the soles of my feet , I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt. ”
NCV	Isaiah	37	26	“ ‘ King of Assyria , surely you have heard . Long ago I , the Lord , planned these things . Long ago I designed them , and now I have made them happen . I allowed you to turn those strong , walled cities into piles of rocks .
NCV	Isaiah	37	27	The people in those cities were weak ; they were frightened and put to shame . They were like grass in the field , like tender , young grass , like grass on the housetop that is burned by the wind before it can grow .
NCV	Isaiah	37	28	“ ‘ I know when you rest , when you come and go , and how you rage against me .
NCV	Isaiah	37	29	Because you rage against me , and because I have heard your proud words , I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth . Then I will force you to leave my country the same way you came. ’
NCV	Isaiah	37	30	“ Then the Lord said , ‘ Hezekiah , I will give you this sign : This year you will eat the grain that grows wild , and the second year you will eat what grows wild from that . But in the third year , plant grain and harvest it . Plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
NCV	Isaiah	37	31	Some of the people in the family of Judah will escape . Like plants that take root , they will grow strong and have many children .
NCV	Isaiah	37	32	A few people will come out of Jerusalem alive ; a few from Mount Zion will live . The strong love of the Lord All-Powerful will make this happen. ’
NCV	Isaiah	37	33	“ So this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria : ‘ He will not enter this city or even shoot an arrow here . He will not fight against it with shields or build a ramp to attack the city walls .
NCV	Isaiah	37	34	He will return to his country the same way he came , and he will not enter this city , ’ says the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	37	35	‘ I will defend and save this city for my sake and for David , my servant. ’ ”
NCV	Isaiah	37	36	Then the angel of the Lord went out and killed one hundred eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp . When the people got up early the next morning , they saw all the dead bodies .
NCV	Isaiah	37	38	One day as Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch , his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword . Then they escaped to the land of Ararat .

NCV	Isaiah	38	38	At that time Hezekiah became very sick ; he was almost dead . The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him , “ This is what the Lord says : Make arrangements , because you are not going to live , but die. ”
NCV	Isaiah	38	2	Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed to the Lord ,
NCV	Isaiah	38	3	“ Lord , please remember that I have always obeyed you . I have given myself completely to you and have done what you said was right. ” Then Hezekiah cried loudly .
NCV	Isaiah	38	4	Then the Lord spoke his word to Isaiah :
NCV	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go to Hezekiah and tell him : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says : I have heard your prayer and seen your tears . So I will add fifteen years to your life .
NCV	Isaiah	38	6	I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria ; I will defend this city .
NCV	Isaiah	38	7	“ ‘ The Lord will do what he says . This is the sign from the Lord to show you :
NCV	Isaiah	38	8	The sun has made a shadow go down the stairway of Ahaz , but I will make it go back ten steps. ’ ” So the shadow made by the sun went back up the ten steps it had gone down .
NCV	Isaiah	38	9	After Hezekiah king of Judah got well , he wrote this song :
NCV	Isaiah	38	10	I said , “ I am in the middle of my life . Do I have to go through the gates of death ? Will I have the rest of my life taken away from me ? ”
NCV	Isaiah	38	11	I said , “ I will not see the Lord in the land of the living again . I will not again see the people who live on the earth .
NCV	Isaiah	38	12	Like a shepherd ’ s tent , my home has been pulled down and taken from me . I am finished like the cloth a weaver rolls up and cuts from the loom . [ a ] In one day you brought me to this end .
NCV	Isaiah	38	13	All night I cried loudly . Like a lion , he crushed all my bones . In one day you brought me to this end .
NCV	Isaiah	38	14	I cried like a bird and moaned like a dove . My eyes became tired as I looked to the heavens . Lord , I have troubles . Please help me. ”
NCV	Isaiah	38	15	What can I say ? The Lord told me what would happen and then made it happen . I have had these troubles in my soul , so now I will be humble all my life .
NCV	Isaiah	38	16	Lord , because of you , people live . Because of you , my spirit also lives ; you made me well and let me live .
NCV	Isaiah	38	17	It was for my own good that I had such troubles . Because you love me very much , you did not let me die but threw my sins far away .
NCV	Isaiah	38	18	People in the place of the dead can not praise you ; those who have died can not sing praises to you ; those who die don ’ t trust you to help them .
NCV	Isaiah	38	19	The people who are alive are the ones who praise you . They praise you as I praise you today . A father should tell his children that you provide help .
NCV	Isaiah	38	20	The Lord saved me , so we will play songs on stringed instruments in the Temple of the Lord all the days of our lives .
NCV	Isaiah	38	21	Then Isaiah said , “ Make a paste from figs and put it on Hezekiah ’ s boil . Then he will get well. ”

NCV	Isaiah	39	39	At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon . He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah , because he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and was now well .
NCV	Isaiah	39	2	Hezekiah was pleased and showed the messengers what was in his storehouses : the silver , gold , spices , expensive perfumes , his swords and shields , and all his wealth . He showed them everything in his palace and in his kingdom .

NCV	Isaiah	42	42	“ Here is my servant , the one I support . He is the one I chose , and I am pleased with him . I have put my Spirit upon him , and he will bring justice to all nations .
NCV	Isaiah	42	2	He will not cry out or yell or speak loudly in the streets .
NCV	Isaiah	42	3	He will not break a crushed blade of grass or put out even a weak flame . He will truly bring justice ;
NCV	Isaiah	42	4	he will not lose hope or give up until he brings justice to the world . And people far away will trust his teachings. ”
NCV	Isaiah	42	5	God , the Lord , said these things . He created the skies and stretched them out . He spread out the earth and everything on it . He gives life to all people on earth , to everyone who walks on the earth .
NCV	Isaiah	42	6	The Lord says , “ I , the Lord , called you to do right , and I will hold your hand and protect you . You will be the sign of my agreement with the people , a light to shine for all people .

NCV	Isaiah	42	8	“ I am the Lord . That is my name . I will not give my glory to another ; I will not let idols take the praise that should be mine .
NCV	Isaiah	42	9	The things I said would happen have happened , and now I tell you about new things . Before those things happen , I tell you about them. ” A Song of Praise to the Lord
NCV	Isaiah	42	10	Sing a new song to the Lord ; sing his praise everywhere on the earth . Praise him , you people who sail on the seas and you animals who live in them . Praise him , you people living in faraway places .
NCV	Isaiah	42	11	The deserts and their cities should praise him . The settlements of Kedar should praise him . The people living in Sela should sing for joy ; they should shout from the mountaintops .
NCV	Isaiah	42	12	They should give glory to the Lord . People in faraway lands should praise him .
NCV	Isaiah	42	13	The Lord will march out like a strong soldier ; he will be excited like a man ready to fight a war . He will shout out the battle cry and defeat his enemies .

NCV	Isaiah	42	16	Then I will lead the blind along a way they never knew ; I will guide them along paths they have not known . I will make the darkness become light for them , and the rough ground smooth . These are the things I will do ; I will not leave my people .

NCV	Isaiah	42	18	“ You who are deaf , hear me . You who are blind , look and see .
NCV	Isaiah	42	19	No one is more blind than my servant Israel or more deaf than the messenger I send . No one is more blind than the person I own or more blind than the servant of the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	42	20	Israel , you have seen much , but you have not obeyed . You hear , but you refuse to listen. ”
NCV	Isaiah	42	21	The Lord made his teachings wonderful , because he is good .
NCV	Isaiah	42	22	These people have been defeated and robbed . They are trapped in pits or locked up in prison . Like robbers , enemies have taken them away , and there is no one to save them . Enemies carried them off , and no one said , “ Bring them back. ”
NCV	Isaiah	42	23	Will any of you listen to this ? Will you listen carefully in the future ?
NCV	Isaiah	42	24	Who let the people of Jacob be carried off ? Who let robbers take Israel away ? The Lord allowed this to happen , because we sinned against him . We did not live the way he wanted us to live and did not obey his teaching .
NCV	Isaiah	42	25	So he became very angry with us and brought terrible wars against us . It was as if the people of Israel had fire all around them , but they didn ’ t know what was happening .

NCV	Isaiah	43	18	The Lord says , “ Forget what happened before , and do not think about the past .
NCV	Isaiah	43	19	Look at the new thing I am going to do . It is already happening . Don ’ t you see it ? I will make a road in the desert and rivers in the dry land .

NCV	Isaiah	43	22	“ People of Jacob , you have not called to me ; people of Israel , you have become tired of me .
NCV	Isaiah	43	23	You have not brought me your sacrifices of sheep nor honored me with your sacrifices . I did not weigh you down with sacrifices to offer or make you tired with incense to burn .
NCV	Isaiah	43	24	So you did not buy incense for me ; you did not freely bring me fat from your sacrifices . Instead you have weighed me down with your many sins ; you have made me tired of your many wrongs .

NCV	Isaiah	44	9	Some people make idols , but they are worth nothing . People treasure them , but they are useless . Those people are witnesses for the statues , but those people can not see . They know nothing , so they will be ashamed .
NCV	Isaiah	44	10	Who made these gods ? Who made these useless idols ?
NCV	Isaiah	44	11	The workmen who made them will be ashamed , because they are only human . If they all would come together , they would all be ashamed and afraid .
NCV	Isaiah	44	12	One workman uses tools to heat iron , and he works over hot coals . With his hammer he beats the metal and makes a statue , using his powerful arms . But when he becomes hungry , he loses his power . If he does not drink water , he becomes tired .
NCV	Isaiah	44	13	Another workman uses a line and a compass to draw on the wood . Then he uses his chisels to cut a statue and his calipers to measure the statue . In this way , the workman makes the wood look exactly like a person , and this statue of a person sits in the house .

NCV	Isaiah	44	15	Then he burns the tree . He uses some of the wood for a fire to keep himself warm . He also starts a fire to bake his bread . But he uses part of the wood to make a god , and then he worships it ! He makes the idol and bows down to it !
NCV	Isaiah	44	16	The man burns half of the wood in the fire . He uses the fire to cook his meat , and he eats the meat until he is full . He also burns the wood to keep himself warm . He says , “ Good ! Now I am warm . I can see because of the fire ’ s light. ”
NCV	Isaiah	44	17	But he makes a statue from the wood that is left and calls it his god . He bows down to it and worships it . He prays to it and says , “ You are my god . Save me ! ”

They have never thought to themselves , “ I burned half of the wood in the fire and used the hot coals to bake my bread . I cooked and ate my meat . And I used the wood that was left to make this hateful thing . I am worshiping a block of wood ! ”
NCV	Isaiah	44	20	He doesn ’ t know what he is doing ; his confused mind leads him the wrong way . He can not save himself or say , “ This statue I am holding is a false god. ” The Lord Is the True God

NCV	Isaiah	57	5	You have sexual relations under every green tree to worship your gods . You kill children in the ravines and sacrifice them in the rocky places .
NCV	Isaiah	57	6	You take the smooth rocks from the ravines as your portion . You pour drink offerings on them to worship them , and you give grain offerings to them . Do you think this makes me want to show you mercy ?
NCV	Isaiah	57	7	You make your bed on every hill and mountain , and there you offer sacrifices .
NCV	Isaiah	57	8	You have hidden your idols behind your doors and doorposts . You have left me , and you have uncovered yourself . You have pulled back the covers and climbed into bed . You have made an agreement with those whose beds you love , and you have looked at their nakedness .

NCV	Isaiah	57	14	Someone will say , “ Build a road ! Build a road ! Prepare the way ! Make the way clear for my people. ”
NCV	Isaiah	57	15	And this is the reason : God lives forever and is holy . He is high and lifted up . He says , “ I live in a high and holy place , but I also live with people who are sad and humble . I give new life to those who are humble and to those whose hearts are broken .

NCV	Isaiah	58	3	They say , ‘ To honor you we had special days when we fasted , but you didn ’ t see . We humbled ourselves to honor you , but you didn ’ t notice. ’ ” But the Lord says , “ You do what pleases yourselves on these special days , and you are unfair to your workers .
NCV	Isaiah	58	4	On these special days when you fast , you argue and fight and hit each other with your fists . You can not do these things as you do now and believe your prayers are heard in heaven .
NCV	Isaiah	58	5	This kind of special day is not what I want . This is not the way I want people to be sorry for what they have done .

This is what you do on your special days when you fast , but do you think this is what the Lord wants ?

NCV	Isaiah	59	59	Surely the Lord ’ s power is enough to save you . He can hear you when you ask him for help .

NCV	Isaiah	59	3	With your hands you have killed others , and with your fingers you have done wrong . With your lips you have lied , and with your tongue you say evil things .
NCV	Isaiah	59	4	People take each other to court unfairly , and no one tells the truth in arguing his case . They accuse each other falsely and tell lies . They cause trouble and create more evil .
NCV	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch evil like eggs from poisonous snakes . If you eat one of those eggs , you will die , and if you break one open , a poisonous snake comes out . People tell lies as they would spin a spider ’ s web .
NCV	Isaiah	59	6	The webs they make can not be used for clothes ; you can ’ t cover yourself with those webs . The things they do are evil , and they use their hands to hurt others .
NCV	Isaiah	59	7	They eagerly run to do evil , and they are always ready to kill innocent people . They think evil thoughts . Everywhere they go they cause ruin and destruction .
NCV	Isaiah	59	8	They don ’ t know how to live in peace , and there is no fairness in their lives . They are dishonest . Anyone who lives as they live will never have peace . Israel ’ s Sin Brings Trouble

NCV	Isaiah	59	12	We have done many wrong things against our God ; our sins show we are wrong . We know we have turned against God ; we know the evil things we have done :
NCV	Isaiah	59	13	sinning and rejecting the Lord , turning away from our God , planning to hurt others and to disobey God , planning and speaking lies .
NCV	Isaiah	59	14	So we have driven away justice , and we have kept away from what is right . Truth is not spoken in the streets ; what is honest is not allowed to enter the city .
NCV	Isaiah	59	15	Truth can not be found anywhere , and people who refuse to do evil are attacked . The Lord looked and could not find any justice , and he was displeased .
NCV	Isaiah	59	16	He could not find anyone to help the people , and he was surprised that there was no one to help . So he used his own power to save the people ; his own goodness gave him strength .
NCV	Isaiah	59	17	He covered himself with goodness like armor . He put the helmet of salvation on his head . He put on his clothes for punishing and wrapped himself in the coat of his strong love .
NCV	Isaiah	59	18	The Lord will pay back his enemies for what they have done . He will show his anger to those who were against him ; he will punish the people in faraway places as they deserve .
NCV	Isaiah	59	19	Then people from the west will fear the Lord , and people from the east will fear his glory . The Lord will come quickly like a fast-flowing river , driven by the breath of the Lord .

NCV	Isaiah	64	6	All of us are dirty with sin . All the right things we have done are like filthy pieces of cloth . All of us are like dead leaves , and our sins , like the wind , have carried us away .
NCV	Isaiah	64	7	No one worships you or even asks you to help us . That is because you have turned away from us and have let our sins destroy us .
NCV	Isaiah	64	8	But Lord , you are our father . We are like clay , and you are the potter ; your hands made us all .
NCV	Isaiah	64	9	Lord , don ’ t continue to be angry with us ; don ’ t remember our sins forever . Please , look at us , because we are your people .
NCV	Isaiah	64	10	Your holy cities are empty like the desert . Jerusalem is like a desert ; it is destroyed .
NCV	Isaiah	64	11	Our ancestors worshiped you in our holy and wonderful Temple , but now it has been burned with fire , and all our precious things have been destroyed .
NCV	Isaiah	64	12	When you see these things , will you hold yourself back from helping us , Lord ? Will you be silent and punish us beyond what we can stand ? The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	65	65	The Lord says , “ I made myself known to people who were not looking for me . I was found by those who were not asking me for help . I said , ‘ Here I am . Here I am , ’ to a nation that was not praying to me .
NCV	Isaiah	65	2	All day long I stood ready to accept people who turned against me , but the way they continue to live is not good ; they do anything they want to do .
NCV	Isaiah	65	3	Right in front of me they continue to do things that make me angry . They offer sacrifices to their gods in their gardens , and they burn incense on altars of brick .
NCV	Isaiah	65	4	They sit among the graves and spend their nights waiting to get messages from the dead . They eat the meat of pigs , and their pots are full of soup made from meat that is wrong to eat .
NCV	Isaiah	65	5	But they tell others , ‘ Stay away , and don ’ t come near me . I am too holy for you. ’ These people are like smoke in my nose . Like a fire that burns all the time , they continue to make me angry .
NCV	Isaiah	65	6	“ Look , it is written here before me . I will not be quiet ; instead , I will repay you in full . I will punish you for what you have done .
NCV	Isaiah	65	7	I will punish you for your sins and your ancestors ’ sins , ” says the Lord . “ They burned incense to gods on the mountains and shamed me on those hills . So I will punish them as they should be punished for what they did. ”
NCV	Isaiah	65	8	This is what the Lord says : “ When there is juice left in the grapes , people do not destroy them , because they know there is good left in them . So I will do the same thing to my servants— I will not completely destroy them .
NCV	Isaiah	65	9	I will leave some of the children of Jacob , and some of the people of Judah will receive my mountain . I will choose the people who will live there ; my servants will live there .
NCV	Isaiah	65	10	Then the Plain of Sharon will be a field for flocks , and the Valley of Achor will be a place for herds to rest . They will be for the people who want to follow me .
NCV	Isaiah	65	11	“ But as for you who left the Lord , who forgot about my holy mountain , who worship the god Luck , who hold religious feasts for the god Fate ,
NCV	Isaiah	65	12	I decide your fate , and I will punish you with my sword . You will all be killed , because I called you , but you refused to answer . I spoke to you , but you wouldn ’ t listen . You did the things I said were evil and chose to do things that displease me. ”
NCV	Isaiah	65	13	So this is what the Lord God says : “ My servants will eat , but you evil people will be hungry . My servants will drink , but you evil people will be thirsty . My servants will be happy , but you evil people will be shamed .
NCV	Isaiah	65	14	My servants will shout for joy because of the goodness of their hearts , but you evil people will cry , because you will be sad . You will cry loudly , because your spirits will be broken .
NCV	Isaiah	65	15	Your names will be like curses to my servants , and the Lord God will put you to death . But he will call his servants by another name .
NCV	Isaiah	65	16	People in the land who ask for blessings will ask for them from the faithful God . And people in the land who make a promise will promise in the name of the faithful God , because the troubles of the past will be forgotten . I will make those troubles go away . A New Time Is Coming
NCV	Isaiah	65	17	“ Look , I will make new heavens and a new earth , and people will not remember the past or think about those things .
NCV	Isaiah	65	18	My people will be happy forever because of the things I will make . I will make a Jerusalem that is full of joy , and I will make her people a delight .
NCV	Isaiah	65	19	Then I will rejoice over Jerusalem and be delighted with my people . There will never again be heard in that city the sounds of crying and sadness .
NCV	Isaiah	65	20	There will never be a baby from that city who lives only a few days . And there will never be an older person who doesn ’ t have a long life . A person who lives a hundred years will be called young , and a person who dies before he is a hundred will be thought of as a sinner .
NCV	Isaiah	65	21	In that city those who build houses will live there . Those who plant vineyards will get to eat their grapes .
NCV	Isaiah	65	22	No more will one person build a house and someone else live there . One person will not plant a garden and someone else eat its fruit . My people will live a long time , as trees live long . My chosen people will live there and enjoy the things they make .
NCV	Isaiah	65	23	They will never again work for nothing . They will never again give birth to children who die young . All my people will be blessed by the Lord ; they and their children will be blessed .
NCV	Isaiah	65	24	I will provide for their needs before they ask , and I will help them while they are still asking for help .
NCV	Isaiah	65	25	Wolves and lambs will eat together in peace . Lions will eat hay like oxen , and a snake on the ground will not hurt anyone . They will not hurt or destroy each other on all my holy mountain , ” says the Lord . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Isaiah	66	66	This is what the Lord says : “ Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . So do you think you can build a house for me ? Do I need a place to rest ?
NCV	Isaiah	66	2	My hand made all things . All things are here because I made them , ” says the Lord . “ These are the people I am pleased with : those who are not proud or stubborn and who fear my word .
NCV	Isaiah	66	3	But those people who kill bulls as a sacrifice to me are like those who kill people . Those who kill sheep as a sacrifice are like those who break the necks of dogs . Those who give me grain offerings are like those who offer me the blood of pigs . [ a ] Those who burn incense are like those who worship idols . These people choose their own ways , not mine , and they love the terrible things they do .
NCV	Isaiah	66	4	So I will choose their punishments , and I will punish them with what they fear most . This is because I called to them , but they did not listen . I spoke to them , but they did not hear me . They did things I said were evil ; they chose to do things I did not like. ”
NCV	Isaiah	66	5	You people who obey the words of the Lord , listen to what he says : “ Your brothers hated you and turned against you because you followed me . Your brothers said , ‘ Let the Lord be honored so we may see you rejoice , ’ but they will be punished .
NCV	Isaiah	66	6	Listen to the loud noise coming from the city ; hear the noise from the Temple . It is the Lord punishing his enemies , giving them the punishment they should have .
NCV	Isaiah	66	7	“ A woman does not give birth before she feels the pain ; she does not give birth to a son before the pain starts .
NCV	Isaiah	66	8	No one has ever heard of that happening ; no one has ever seen that happen . In the same way no one ever saw a country begin in one day ; no one has ever heard of a new nation beginning in one moment . But Jerusalem will give birth to her children just as soon as she feels the birth pains .
NCV	Isaiah	66	9	In the same way I will not cause pain without allowing something new to be born , ” says the Lord . “ If I cause you the pain , I will not stop you from giving birth to your new nation , ” says your God .
NCV	Isaiah	66	10	“ Jerusalem , rejoice . All you people who love Jerusalem , be happy . Those of you who felt sad for Jerusalem should now feel happy with her .
NCV	Isaiah	66	11	You will take comfort from her and be satisfied , as a child is nursed by its mother . You will receive her good things and enjoy her wealth. ”
NCV	Isaiah	66	12	This is what the Lord says : “ I will give her peace that will flow to her like a river . The wealth of the nations will come to her like a river overflowing its banks . Like babies you will be nursed and held in my arms and bounced on my knees .
NCV	Isaiah	66	13	I will comfort you as a mother comforts her child . You will be comforted in Jerusalem. ”
NCV	Isaiah	66	14	When you see these things , you will be happy , and you will grow like the grass . The Lord ’ s servants will see his power , but his enemies will see his anger .
NCV	Isaiah	66	15	Look , the Lord is coming with fire and his armies with clouds of dust . He will punish those people with his anger ; he will punish them with flames of fire .
NCV	Isaiah	66	16	The Lord will judge the people with fire , and he will destroy many people with his sword ; he will kill many people .
NCV	Isaiah	66	17	“ These people make themselves holy and pure to go to worship their gods in their gardens . Following each other into their special gardens , they eat the meat of pigs and rats and other hateful things . But they will all be destroyed together , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	66	18	“ I know they have evil thoughts and do evil things , so I am coming to punish them . I will gather all nations and all people , and they will come together and see my glory .
NCV	Isaiah	66	19	“ I will put a mark on some of the people , and I will send some of these saved people to the nations : to Tarshish , Libya , Lud ( the land of archers ) , Tubal , Greece , and all the faraway lands . These people have never heard about what I have done nor seen my glory . So the saved people will tell the nations about my glory .
NCV	Isaiah	66	20	And they will bring all your fellow Israelites from all nations to my holy mountain in Jerusalem . Your fellow Israelites will come on horses , donkeys , and camels and in chariots and wagons . They will be like the grain offerings that the people bring in clean containers to the Temple , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	66	21	“ And I will choose even some of these people to be priests and Levites , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	66	22	“ I will make new heavens and the new earth , which will last forever , ” says the Lord . “ In the same way , your names and your children will always be with me .
NCV	Isaiah	66	23	All people will come to worship me every Sabbath and every New Moon , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Isaiah	66	24	“ They will go out and see the dead bodies of the people who sinned against me . The worms that eat them will never die , and the fires that burn them will never stop , and everyone will hate to see those bodies. ” Footnotes - 66:3 dogs . . . pigs God did not want his people to offer dogs and pigs as sacrifices because they were unclean animals .

NCV	Jeremiah	2	2	“ Go and speak to the people of Jerusalem , saying : This is what the Lord says : ‘ I remember how faithful you were to me when you were a young nation . You loved me like a young bride . You followed me through the desert , a land that had never been planted .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	3	The people of Israel were holy to the Lord , like the firstfruits from his harvest . Those who tried to hurt Israel were judged guilty . Disasters struck them , ’ ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	4	Hear the word of the Lord , family of Jacob , all you family groups of Israel .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	5	This is what the Lord says : “ I was fair to your ancestors , so why did they turn away from me ? Your ancestors worshiped useless idols and became useless themselves .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	6	Your ancestors didn ’ t say , ‘ Where is the Lord who brought us out of Egypt ? He led us through the desert , through a dry and rocky land , through a dark and dangerous land . He led us where no one travels or lives. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	2	7	I brought you into a fertile land so you could eat its fruit and produce . But you came and made my land unclean ; you made it a hateful place .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests didn ’ t ask , ‘ Where is the Lord ? ’ The people who know the teachings didn ’ t know me . The leaders turned against me . The prophets prophesied in the name of Baal and worshiped useless idols .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	9	“ So now I will again tell what I have against you , ” says the Lord . “ And I will tell what I have against your grandchildren .

NCV	Jeremiah	2	14	Have the people of Israel become slaves ? Have they become like someone who was born a slave ? Why were they taken captive ?
NCV	Jeremiah	2	15	Enemies have roared like lions at Israel ; they have growled at Israel . They have destroyed the land of Israel . The cities of Israel lie in ruins , and all the people have left .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	16	The men from the cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes have disgraced you by shaving the top of your head .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	17	Haven ’ t you brought this on yourselves by turning away from the Lord your God when he was leading you in the right way ?
NCV	Jeremiah	2	18	It did not help to go to Egypt and drink from the Shihor River . It did not help to go to Assyria and drink from the Euphrates River .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	19	Your evil will bring punishment to you , and the wrong you have done will teach you a lesson . Think about it and understand that it is a terrible evil to turn away from the Lord your God . It is wrong not to fear me , ” says the Lord God All-Powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	20	“ Long ago you refused to obey me as an ox breaks its yoke . You broke the ropes I used to hold you and said , ‘ I will not serve you ! ’ In fact , on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down as a prostitute .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	21	But I planted you as a special vine , as a very good seed . How then did you turn into a wild vine that grows bad fruit ?
NCV	Jeremiah	2	22	Although you wash yourself with cleanser and use much soap , I can still see the stain of your guilt , ” says the Lord God .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	23	“ How can you say to me , ‘ I am not guilty . I have not worshiped the Baal idols ’ ? Look at the things you did in the valley . Think about what you have done . You are like a she-camel in mating season that runs from place to place .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	24	You are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert and sniffs the wind at mating time . At that time who can hold her back ? Any male who chases her will easily catch her ; at mating time , it is easy to find her .
NCV	Jeremiah	2	25	Don ’ t run until your feet are bare or until your throat is dry . But you say , ‘ It ’ s no use ! I love those other gods , and I must chase them ! ’

NCV	Jeremiah	3	3	So the rain has not come , and there have not been any spring rains . But your face still looks like the face of a prostitute . You refuse even to be ashamed of what you did .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	2	“ Look up to the bare hilltops , Judah . Is there any place where you have not been a prostitute ? You have sat by the road waiting for lovers , like an Arab in the desert . You made the land unclean , because you did evil and were like a prostitute .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	4	Now you are calling to me , ‘ My father , you have been my friend since I was young .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	5	Will you always be angry at me ? Will your anger last forever ? ’ Judah , you said this , but you did as much evil as you could ! ” Judah and Israel Are like Sisters
NCV	Jeremiah	3	6	When King Josiah was ruling Judah , the Lord said to me , “ Did you see what unfaithful Israel did ? She was like a prostitute with her idols on every hill and under every green tree .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	7	I said to myself , ‘ Israel will come back to me after she does this evil , ’ but she didn ’ t come back . And Israel ’ s wicked sister Judah saw what she did .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	8	Judah saw that I divorced unfaithful Israel because of her adultery , but that didn ’ t make Israel ’ s wicked sister Judah afraid . She also went out and acted like a prostitute !
NCV	Jeremiah	3	9	And she didn ’ t care that she was acting like a prostitute . So she made her country unclean and was guilty of adultery , because she worshiped idols made of stone and wood .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	10	Israel ’ s wicked sister didn ’ t even come back to me with her whole heart , but only pretended , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	11	The Lord said to me , “ Unfaithful Israel had a better excuse than wicked Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	12	Go and speak this message toward the north : ‘ Come back , unfaithful people of Israel , ’ says the Lord . ‘ I will stop being angry at you , because I am full of mercy , ’ says the Lord . ‘ I will not be angry with you forever .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	13	All you have to do is admit your sin— that you turned against the Lord your God and worshiped gods under every green tree and didn ’ t obey me , ’ ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	14	“ Come back to me , you unfaithful children , ” says the Lord , “ because I am your master . I will take one person from every city and two from every family group , and I will bring you to Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	15	Then I will give you new rulers who will be faithful to me , who will lead you with knowledge and understanding .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	16	In those days there will be many of you in the land , ” says the Lord . “ At that time people will no longer say , ‘ I remember the Ark of the Agreement. ’ They won ’ t think about it anymore or remember it or miss it or make another one .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time people will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord , and all nations will come together in Jerusalem to show respect to the Lord . They will not follow their stubborn , evil hearts anymore .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the family of Judah will join the family of Israel . They will come together from a land in the north to the land I gave their ancestors .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	19	“ I , the Lord , said , ‘ How happy I would be to treat you as my own children and give you a pleasant land , a land more beautiful than that of any other nation. ’ I thought you would call me ‘ My Father ’ and not turn away from me .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	20	But like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband , family of Israel , you have been unfaithful to me , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	21	You can hear crying on the bare hilltops . It is the people of Israel crying and praying for mercy . They have become very evil and have forgotten the Lord their God .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	22	“ Come back to me , you unfaithful children , and I will forgive you for being unfaithful. ” “ Yes , we will come to you , because you are the Lord our God .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	23	It was foolish to worship idols on the hills and on the mountains . Surely the salvation of Israel comes from the Lord our God .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	24	Since our youth , shameful gods have eaten up in sacrifice everything our ancestors worked for— their flocks and herds , their sons and daughters .
NCV	Jeremiah	3	25	Let us lie down in our shame , and let our disgrace cover us like a blanket . We have sinned against the Lord our God , both we and our ancestors . From our youth until now , we have not obeyed the Lord our God. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , “ Lord God , you have tricked the people of Judah and Jerusalem . You said , ‘ You will have peace , ’ but now the sword is pointing at our throats ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time this message will be given to Judah and Jerusalem : “ A hot wind blows from the bare hilltops of the desert toward the Lord ’ s people . It is not a gentle wind to separate grain from chaff .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	12	I feel a stronger wind than that . Now even I will announce judgments against the people of Judah. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	4	13	Look ! The enemy rises up like a cloud , and his chariots come like a tornado . His horses are faster than eagles . How terrible it will be for us ! We are ruined !
NCV	Jeremiah	4	14	People of Jerusalem , clean the evil from your hearts so that you can be saved . Don ’ t continue making evil plans .

NCV	Jeremiah	4	22	The Lord says , “ My people are foolish . They do not know me . They are stupid children ; they don ’ t understand . They are skillful at doing evil , but they don ’ t know how to do good. ” Disaster Is Coming
NCV	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked at the earth , and it was empty and had no shape . I looked at the sky , and its light was gone .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains , and they were shaking . All the hills were trembling .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked , and there were no people . Every bird in the sky had flown away .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked , and the good , rich land had become a desert . All its towns had been destroyed by the Lord and his great anger .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	27	This is what the Lord says : “ All the land will be ruined , but I will not completely destroy it .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	28	So the people in the land will cry loudly , and the sky will grow dark , because I have spoken and will not change my mind . I have made a decision , and I will not change it. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	4	29	At the sound of the horsemen and the archers , all the people in the towns run away . They hide in the thick bushes and climb up into the rocks . All of the cities of Judah are empty ; no one lives in them .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	30	Judah , you destroyed nation , what are you doing ? Why do you put on your finest dress and decorate yourself with gold jewelry ? Why do you put color around your eyes ? You make yourself beautiful , but it is all useless . Your lovers hate you ; they want to kill you .
NCV	Jeremiah	4	31	I hear a cry like a woman having a baby , distress like a woman having her first child . It is the sound of Jerusalem gasping for breath . She lifts her hands in prayer and says , “ Oh ! I am about to faint before my murderers ! ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	5	5	So I will go to the leaders of Judah and talk to them . Surely they understand the way of the Lord and know what God wants them to do. ” But even the leaders had all joined together to break away from the Lord ; they had broken their ties with him .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	2	Although the people say , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives ! ’ they don ’ t really mean it. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	5	3	Lord , don ’ t you look for truth in people ? You struck the people of Judah , but they didn ’ t feel any pain . You crushed them , but they refused to learn what is right . They became more stubborn than a rock ; they refused to turn back to God .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	4	But I thought , “ These are only the poor , foolish people . They have not learned the way of the Lord and what their God wants them to do .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	6	So a lion from the forest will attack them . A wolf from the desert will kill them . A leopard is waiting for them near their towns . It will tear to pieces anyone who comes out of the city , because the people of Judah have sinned greatly . They have wandered away from the Lord many times .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	7	The Lord said , “ Tell me why I should forgive you . Your children have left me and have made promises to idols that are not gods at all . I gave your children everything they needed , but they still were like an unfaithful wife to me . They spent much time in houses of prostitutes .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	8	They are like well-fed horses filled with sexual desire ; each one wants another man ’ s wife .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	9	Shouldn ’ t I punish the people of Judah for doing these things ? ” says the Lord . “ Shouldn ’ t I give a nation such as this the punishment it deserves ?
NCV	Jeremiah	5	10	“ Go along and cut down Judah ’ s vineyards , but do not completely destroy them . Cut off all her people as if they were branches , because they do not belong to the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	11	The families of Israel and Judah have been completely unfaithful to me , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	12	Those people have lied about the Lord and said , “ He will not do anything to us ! Nothing bad will happen to us ! We will never see war or hunger !
NCV	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets are like an empty wind ; the word of God is not in them . Let the bad things they say happen to them. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	5	14	So this is what the Lord God All-Powerful says : “ The people said I would not punish them . So , the words I give you will be like fire , and these people will be like wood that it burns up .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	15	Listen , family of Israel , ” says the Lord , “ I will soon bring a nation from far away to attack you . It is an old nation that has lasted a long time . The people there speak a language you do not know ; you can not understand what they say .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	16	Their arrows bring death . All their people are strong warriors .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	17	They will eat your crops and your food . They will eat your sons and daughters . They will eat your flocks and herds . They will eat your grapes and figs . They will destroy with their swords the strong , walled cities you trust .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	18	“ Yet even then , ” says the Lord , “ I will not destroy you completely .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	19	When the people of Judah ask , ‘ Why has the Lord our God done all these terrible things to us ? ’ then give them this answer : ‘ You have left the Lord and served foreign idols in your own land . So now you will serve foreigners in a land that does not belong to you. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	5	20	“ Announce this message to the family of Jacob , and tell it to the nation of Judah :
NCV	Jeremiah	5	21	Hear this message , you foolish people who have no sense . They have eyes , but they don ’ t really see . They have ears , but they don ’ t really listen .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	22	Surely you are afraid of me , ” says the Lord . “ You should shake with fear in my presence . I am the one who made the beaches to be a border for the sea , a border the water can never go past . The waves may pound the beach , but they can ’ t win over it . They may roar , but they can not go beyond it .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	23	But the people of Judah are stubborn and have turned against me . They have turned aside and gone away from me .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	24	They do not say to themselves , ‘ We should fear the Lord our God , who gives us autumn and spring rains in their seasons , who makes sure we have the harvest at the right time. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	5	25	But your evil has kept away both rain and harvest . Your sins have kept you from enjoying good things .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	26	There are wicked men among my people . Like those who make nets for catching birds , they set their traps to catch people .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	27	Like cages full of birds , their houses are full of lies . They have become rich and powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	28	They have grown big and fat . There is no end to the evil things they do . They won ’ t plead the case of the orphan or help the poor be judged fairly .
NCV	Jeremiah	5	29	Shouldn ’ t I punish the people of Judah for doing these things ? ” says the Lord . “ Shouldn ’ t I give a nation such as this the punishment it deserves ?
NCV	Jeremiah	5	30	“ A terrible and shocking thing has happened in the land of Judah :

NCV	Jeremiah	6	6	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Cut down the trees around Jerusalem , and build an attack ramp to the top of its walls . This city must be punished . Inside it is nothing but slavery .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	2	Jerusalem , I will destroy you , you who are fragile and gentle .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds with their flocks will come against Jerusalem . They will set up their tents all around her , each shepherd taking care of his own section. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	4	They say , “ Get ready to fight against Jerusalem ! Get up ! We will attack at noon ! But it is already getting late ; the evening shadows are growing long .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	5	So get up ! We will attack at night . We will destroy the strong towers of Jerusalem ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	7	Jerusalem pours out her evil as a well pours out its water . The sounds of violence and destruction are heard within her . I can see the sickness and hurts of Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	8	Listen to this warning , Jerusalem , or I will turn my back on you and make your land an empty desert where no one can live. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	9	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Gather the few people of Israel who are left alive , as you would gather the last grapes on a grapevine . Check each vine again , like someone who gathers grapes. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom can I speak ? Whom can I warn ? Who will listen to me ? The people of Israel have closed ears , so they can not hear my warnings . They don ’ t like the word of the Lord ; they don ’ t want to listen to it !
NCV	Jeremiah	6	11	But I am full of the anger of the Lord , and I am tired of holding it in . “ Pour out my anger on the children who play in the street and on the young men gathered together . A husband and his wife will both be caught in his anger , as will the very old .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	12	Their houses will be turned over to others , along with their fields and wives , because I will raise my hand and punish the people of Judah , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	13	“ Everyone , from the least important to the greatest , is greedy for money . Even the prophets and priests all tell lies .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	14	They tried to heal my people ’ s serious injuries as if they were small wounds . They said , ‘ It ’ s all right , it ’ s all right. ’ But really , it is not all right .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	15	They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act , but they are not ashamed at all . They don ’ t even know how to blush about their sins . So they will fall , along with everyone else . They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	16	This is what the Lord says : “ Stand where the roads cross and look . Ask where the old way is , where the good way is , and walk on it . If you do , you will find rest for yourselves . But they have said , ‘ We will not walk on the good way. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	6	17	I set watchmen over you and told you , ‘ Listen for the sound of the war trumpet ! ’ But they said , ‘ We will not listen. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	6	18	So listen , all you nations , and pay attention , you witnesses . Watch what I will do to the people of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear this , people of the earth : I am going to bring disaster to the people of Judah because of the evil they plan . They have not listened to my messages and have rejected my teachings .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	20	Why do you bring me offerings of incense from the land of Sheba ? Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway land ? Your burnt offerings will not be accepted ; your sacrifices do not please me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	21	So this is what the Lord says : “ I will put problems in front of Judah . Fathers and sons will stumble over them together . Neighbors and friends will die. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	22	This is what the Lord says : “ Look , an army is coming from the land of the north ; a great nation is coming from the far sides of the earth .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	23	The soldiers carry bows and spears . They are cruel and show no mercy . They sound like the roaring ocean when they ride their horses . That army is coming lined up for battle , ready to attack you , Jerusalem. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard the news about that army and are helpless from fear . We are gripped by our pain , like a woman having a baby .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	25	Don ’ t go out into the fields or walk down the roads , because the enemy has swords . There is terror on every side .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	26	My people , put on rough cloth and roll in the ashes to show how sad you are . Cry loudly for those who are dead , as if your only son were dead , because the destroyer will soon come against us .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	27	“ Jeremiah , I have made you like a worker who tests metal , and my people are like the ore. You must observe their ways and test them .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	28	All my people have turned against me and are stubborn . They go around telling lies about others . They are like bronze and iron that became covered with rust . They all act dishonestly .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	29	The fire is fanned to make it hotter , but the lead does not melt . The pure metal does not come out ; the evil is not removed from my people .
NCV	Jeremiah	6	30	My people will be called rejected silver , because the Lord has rejected them. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	7	7	If you do these things , I will let you live in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	2	“ Stand at the gate of the Temple and preach this message there : “ ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , all you people of the nation of Judah ! All you who come through these gates to worship the Lord , listen to this message !
NCV	Jeremiah	7	3	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Change your lives and do what is right ! Then I will let you live in this place .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	4	Don ’ t trust the lies of people who say , “ This is the Temple of the Lord . This is the Temple of the Lord . This is the Temple of the Lord ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	7	5	You must change your lives and do what is right . Be fair to each other .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	6	You must not be hard on strangers , orphans , and widows . Don ’ t kill innocent people in this place ! Don ’ t follow other gods , or they will ruin your lives .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	8	“ ‘ But look , you are trusting lies , which is useless .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	9	Will you steal and murder and be guilty of adultery ? Will you falsely accuse other people ? Will you burn incense to the god Baal and follow other gods you have not known ?
NCV	Jeremiah	7	10	If you do that , do you think you can come before me and stand in this place where I have chosen to be worshiped ? Do you think you can say , “ We are safe ! ” when you do all these hateful things ?
NCV	Jeremiah	7	11	This place where I have chosen to be worshiped is nothing more to you than a hideout for robbers . I have been watching you , says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	12	“ ‘ You people of Judah , go now to the town of Shiloh , where I first made a place to be worshiped . See what I did to it because of the evil things the people of Israel had done .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	13	You people of Judah have done all these evil things too , says the Lord . I spoke to you again and again , but you did not listen to me . I called you , but you did not answer .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	14	So I will destroy the place where I have chosen to be worshiped in Jerusalem . You trust in that place , which I gave to you and your ancestors , but I will destroy it just as I destroyed Shiloh .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	15	I will push you away from me just as I pushed away your relatives , the people of Israel ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	7	16	“ As for you , Jeremiah , don ’ t pray for these people . Don ’ t cry out for them or ask anything for them or beg me to help them , because I will not listen to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	17	Don ’ t you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
NCV	Jeremiah	7	18	The children gather wood , and the fathers use the wood to make a fire . The women make the dough for cakes of bread , and they offer them to the Queen Goddess . They pour out drink offerings to other gods to make me angry .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	19	But I am not the one the people of Judah are really hurting , says the Lord . They are only hurting themselves and bringing shame upon themselves .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	20	“ ‘ So this is what the Lord God says : I will pour out my anger on this place , on people and animals , on the trees in the field and the crops in the ground . My anger will be like a hot fire that no one can put out . Obedience Is More than Sacrifice
NCV	Jeremiah	7	21	“ ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Offer burnt offerings along with your other sacrifices , and eat the meat yourselves !
NCV	Jeremiah	7	22	When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , I did not speak to them and give them commands only about burnt offerings and sacrifices .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	23	I also gave them this command : Obey me , and I will be your God and you will be my people . Do all that I command so that good things will happen to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	24	But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me . They were stubborn and did whatever their evil hearts wanted . They went backward , not forward .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	25	Since the day your ancestors left Egypt , I have sent my servants , the prophets , again and again to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	26	But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me . They were very stubborn and did more evil than their ancestors. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	7	27	“ Jeremiah , you will tell all these things to the people of Judah , but they will not listen to you . You will call to them , but they will not answer you .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	28	So say to them , ‘ This is the nation that has not obeyed the Lord its God . These people do nothing when I correct them . They do not tell the truth ; it has disappeared from their lips . The Valley of Killing
NCV	Jeremiah	7	29	“ ‘ Cut off your hair and throw it away . Go up to the bare hilltop and cry out , because the Lord has rejected these people . He has turned his back on them , and in his anger will punish them .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	30	The people of Judah have done what I said was evil , says the Lord . They have set up their hateful idols in the place where I have chosen to be worshiped and have made it unclean .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	31	The people of Judah have built places of worship at Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom . There they burned their own sons and daughters as sacrifices , something I never commanded . It never even entered my mind .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	32	So , I warn you . The days are coming , says the Lord , when people will not call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom anymore . They will call it the Valley of Killing . They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no room to bury anyone else .
NCV	Jeremiah	7	33	Then the bodies of the dead will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals . There will be no one left alive to chase them away .

NCV	Jeremiah	8	8	“ ‘ You keep saying , “ We are wise , because we have the teachings of the Lord. ” But actually , those who explain the Scriptures have written lies with their pens .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	2	The bones will be spread on the ground under the sun , moon , and stars that the people loved and served and went after and searched for and worshiped . No one will gather up the bones and bury them . So they will be like dung thrown on the ground .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	3	I will force the people of Judah to leave their homes and their land . Those of this evil family who are not dead will wish they were , says the Lord All-Powerful. ’ Sin and Punishment
NCV	Jeremiah	8	4	“ Say to the people of Judah : ‘ This is what the Lord says : When people fall down , don ’ t they get up again ? And when someone goes the wrong way , doesn ’ t he turn back ?
NCV	Jeremiah	8	5	Why , then , have the people of Jerusalem gone the wrong way and not turned back ? They believe their own lies and refuse to turn around and come back .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	6	I have listened to them very carefully , but they do not say what is right . They do not feel sorry about their wicked ways , saying , “ What have I done ? ” Each person goes his own way , like a horse charging into a battle .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	7	Even the birds in the sky know the right times to do things . The storks , doves , swifts , and thrushes know when it is time to migrate . But my people don ’ t know what the Lord wants them to do .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	9	These wise teachers refused to listen to the word of the Lord , so they are not really wise at all . They will be ashamed . They will be shocked and trapped .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	10	So I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners . Everyone , from the least important to the greatest , is greedy for money . Even the prophets and priests all tell lies .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	11	They tried to heal my people ’ s serious injuries as if they were small wounds . They said , “ It ’ s all right , it ’ s all right. ” But really , it is not all right .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	12	They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act , but they are not ashamed at all . They don ’ t even know how to blush about their sins . So they will fall , along with everyone else . They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them , says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	13	“ ‘ I will take away their crops , says the Lord . There will be no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree . Even the leaves will dry up and die . I will take away what I gave them. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	8	14	“ Why are we just sitting here ? Let ’ s get together ! We have sinned against the Lord , so he has given us poisoned water to drink . Come , let ’ s run to the strong , walled cities . The Lord our God has decided that we must die , so let ’ s die there .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	15	We hoped to have peace , but nothing good has come . We hoped for a time when he would heal us , but only terror has come .
NCV	Jeremiah	8	16	From the land of Dan , the snorting of the enemy ’ s horses is heard . The ground shakes from the neighing of their large horses . They have come and destroyed the land and everything in it , the city and all who live there. ”

NCV	Jeremiah	8	20	And the people say , “ Harvest time is over ; summer has ended , and we have not been saved. ”

NCV	Jeremiah	9	9	Shouldn ’ t I punish the people for doing this ? ” says the Lord . “ Shouldn ’ t I give a nation like this the punishment it deserves ? ”
NCV	Jeremiah	9	2	I wish I had a place in the desert— a house where travelers spend the night— so I could leave my people . I could go away from them , because they are all unfaithful to God ; they are all turning against him . Judah ’ s Failures
NCV	Jeremiah	9	3	“ They use their tongues like a bow , shooting lies from their mouths like arrows . Lies , not truth , have grown strong in the land . They go from one evil thing to another . They do not know who I am , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	4	“ Watch out for your friends , and don ’ t trust your own relatives , because every relative is a cheater , and every friend tells lies about you .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	5	Everyone lies to his friend , and no one speaks the truth . The people of Judah have taught their tongues to lie . They have become tired from sinning .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	6	Jeremiah , you live in the middle of lies . With their lies the people refuse to know me , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	7	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ I will test the people of Judah as a person tests metal in a fire . I have no other choice , because my people have sinned .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongues are like sharp arrows . Their mouths speak lies . Everyone speaks nicely to his neighbor , but he is secretly planning to attack him .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	10	I , Jeremiah , will cry loudly for the mountains and sing a funeral song for the empty fields . They are empty , and no one passes through . The mooing of cattle can not be heard . The birds have flown away , and the animals are gone .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	11	“ I , the Lord , will make the city of Jerusalem a heap of ruins , a home for wild dogs . I will destroy the cities of Judah so no one can live there. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	9	12	What person is wise enough to understand these things ? Is there someone who has been taught by the Lord who can explain them ? Why was the land ruined ? Why has it been made like an empty desert where no one goes ?
NCV	Jeremiah	9	13	The Lord answered , “ It is because Judah quit following my teachings that I gave them . They have not obeyed me or done what I told them to do .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	14	Instead , they were stubborn and followed the Baals , as their ancestors taught them to do .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	15	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ I will soon make the people of Judah eat bitter food and drink poisoned water .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them through other nations that they and their ancestors never knew about . I will chase the people of Judah with the sword until they are all killed. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	9	17	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Now , think about these things ! Call for the women who cry at funerals to come . Send for those women who are good at that job .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	18	Let them come quickly and cry loudly for us . Then our eyes will fill with tears , and streams of water will flow from our eyelids .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	19	The sound of loud crying is heard from Jerusalem : ‘ We are truly ruined ! We are truly ashamed ! We must leave our land , because our houses are in ruins. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	9	20	Now , women of Judah , listen to the word of the Lord ; open your ears to hear the words of his mouth . Teach your daughters how to cry loudly . Teach one another a funeral song .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	21	Death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our strong cities . Death has taken away our children who play in the streets and the young men who meet in the city squares .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	22	Say , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ The dead bodies of people will lie in the open field like dung . They will lie like grain a farmer has cut , but there will be no one to gather them. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	9	23	This is what the Lord says : “ The wise must not brag about their wisdom . The strong must not brag about their strength . The rich must not brag about their money .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	24	But if people want to brag , let them brag that they understand and know me . Let them brag that I am the Lord , and that I am kind and fair , and that I do things that are right on earth . This kind of bragging pleases me , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	9	25	The Lord says , “ The time is coming when I will punish all those who are circumcised only in the flesh :
NCV	Jeremiah	9	26	the people of Egypt , Judah , Edom , Ammon , Moab , and the desert people who cut their hair short . The men in all those countries are not circumcised . And the whole family of Israel does not give itself to serving me. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	10	10	But the Lord is the only true God . He is the only living God , the King forever . The earth shakes when he is angry , and the nations can not stand up to his anger .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	2	This is what he says : “ Don ’ t live like the people from other nations , and don ’ t be afraid of special signs in the sky , even though the other nations are afraid of them .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	3	The customs of other people are worth nothing . Their idols are just wood cut from the forest , shaped by a worker with his chisel .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	4	They decorate their idols with silver and gold . With hammers and nails they fasten them down so they won ’ t fall over .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	5	Their idols are like scarecrows in melon fields ; they can not talk . Since they can not walk , they must be carried . Do not be afraid of those idols , because they can ’ t hurt you , and they can ’ t help you either. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	10	6	Lord , there is no one like you . You are great , and your name is great and powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	7	Everyone should respect you , King of the nations ; you deserve respect . Of all the wise people among the nations and in all the kingdoms , none of them is as wise as you .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	8	Those wise people are stupid and foolish . Their teachings come from worthless wooden idols .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	9	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz , so the idols are made by craftsmen and goldsmiths . They put blue and purple clothes on the idols . All these things are made by skilled workers .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	11	“ Tell them this message : ‘ These gods did not make heaven and earth ; they will be destroyed and disappear from heaven and earth. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	10	12	God made the earth by his power . He used his wisdom to build the world and his understanding to stretch out the skies .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	13	When he thunders , the waters in the skies roar . He makes clouds rise in the sky all over the earth . He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	14	People are so stupid and know so little . Goldsmiths are made ashamed by their idols , because those statues are only false gods . They have no breath in them .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	15	They are worth nothing ; people make fun of them . When they are judged , they will be destroyed .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	16	But God , who is Jacob ’ s Portion , is not like the idols . He made everything , and he chose Israel to be his special people . The Lord All-Powerful is his name . Destruction Is Coming
NCV	Jeremiah	10	17	Get everything you own and prepare to leave , you people who are trapped by your enemies .

NCV	Jeremiah	10	19	How terrible it will be for me because of my injury . My wound can not be healed . Yet I told myself , “ This is my sickness ; I must suffer through it. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	10	20	My tent is ruined , and all its ropes are broken . My children have gone away and left me . No one is left to put up my tent again or to set up a shelter for me .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	21	The shepherds are stupid and don ’ t ask the Lord for advice . So they do not have success , and all their flocks are scattered and lost .
NCV	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! The news is coming . A loud noise comes from the north to make the towns of Judah an empty desert and a home for wild dogs ! Jeremiah ’ s Prayer
NCV	Jeremiah	10	23	Lord , I know that our lives don ’ t really belong to us . We can ’ t control our own lives .

NCV	Jeremiah	11	11	So this is what the Lord says : ‘ I will soon bring a disaster on the people of Judah which they will not be able to escape . They will cry to me for help , but I will not listen to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	2	“ Listen to the words of this agreement and tell them to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	3	Tell them this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Cursed is the person who does not obey the words of this agreement
NCV	Jeremiah	11	4	that I made with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt . Egypt was like a furnace for melting iron ! ’ I told them , ‘ Obey me and do everything I command you . Then you will be my people , and I will be your God .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	5	Then I will keep the promise I made to your ancestors to give them a fertile land. ’ And you are living in that country today. ” I answered , “ Amen , Lord. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	11	6	The Lord said to me , “ Announce this message in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem : ‘ Listen to the words of this agreement and obey them .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	7	I warned your ancestors to obey me when I brought them out of Egypt . I have warned them again and again to this very day : “ Obey me ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	11	8	But your ancestors did not listen to me . They were stubborn and did what their own evil hearts wanted . So I made all the curses of this agreement come upon them . I commanded them to obey the agreement , but they did not. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	11	9	Then the Lord said to me , “ I know the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem have made secret plans .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	10	They have gone back to the same sins their ancestors did . Their ancestors refused to listen to my message and followed and worshiped other gods instead . The families of Israel and Judah have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	12	The people living in the towns of Judah and the city of Jerusalem will pray to their idols to whom they burn incense . But those idols will not be able to help when disaster comes .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	13	Look , people of Judah , you have as many idols as there are towns in Judah . You have built as many altars to burn incense to that shameful god Baal as there are streets in Jerusalem. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	11	14	“ As for you , Jeremiah , don ’ t pray for these people or cry out for them or ask anything for them . I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	15	“ What is my beloved Judah doing in my Temple when she makes many evil plans ? Do you think animal sacrifices will stop your punishment ? When you do your evil , then you are happy. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord called you “ a leafy olive tree , with beautiful fruit and shape. ” But with the roar of a strong storm he will set that tree on fire , and its branches will be burned up .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	17	The Lord All-Powerful , who planted you , has announced that disaster will come to you . This is because the families of Israel and Judah have done evil and have made him angry by burning incense to Baal . Evil Plans Against Jeremiah
NCV	Jeremiah	11	18	The Lord showed me that people were making plans against me . Because he showed me what they were doing , I knew they were against me .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	19	Before this , I was like a gentle lamb waiting to be butchered . I did not know they had made plans against me , saying : “ Let us destroy the tree and its fruit . Let ’ s kill him so people will forget him. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	11	20	But , Lord All-Powerful , you are a fair judge . You know how to test peoples ’ hearts and minds . I have told you what I have against them . So let me see you give them the punishment they deserve .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	21	So the Lord speaks about the people from Anathoth who plan to kill Jeremiah and say , “ Don ’ t prophesy in the name of the Lord , or we will kill you ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	11	22	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ I will soon punish the men from Anathoth . Their young men will die in war . Their sons and daughters will die from hunger .
NCV	Jeremiah	11	23	No one from the city of Anathoth will be left alive , because I will cause a disaster to happen to them that year. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	12	12	Many soldiers have marched over those barren hills . The Lord is using the armies to punish that land from one end to the other . No one is safe .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	2	You have put the evil people here like plants with strong roots . They grow and produce fruit . With their mouths they speak well of you , but their hearts are really far away from you .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	3	But you know my heart , Lord . You see me and test my thoughts about you . Drag the evil people away like sheep to be butchered . Set them aside for the day of killing .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	4	How much longer will the land stay dried up and the grass in every field be dead ? The animals and birds in the land have died , because the people are evil . Yes , they are even saying , “ God does not see what happens to us. ” The Lord ’ s Answer to Jeremiah
NCV	Jeremiah	12	5	“ If you get tired while racing against people , how can you race against horses ? If you stumble in a country that is safe , what will you do in the thick thornbushes along the Jordan River ?
NCV	Jeremiah	12	6	Even your own brothers and members of your own family are making plans against you . They are crying out against you . Don ’ t trust them , even when they say nice things to you !
NCV	Jeremiah	12	7	“ I have left Israel ; I have left my people . I have given the people I love over to their enemies .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	8	My people have become to me like a lion in the forest . They roar at me , so I hate them .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	9	My people have become to me like a speckled bird attacked on all sides by hawks . Go , gather the wild animals . Bring them to get something to eat .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds have ruined my vineyards and trampled the plants in my field . They have turned my beautiful field into an empty desert .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	11	They have turned my field into a desert that is wilted and dead . The whole country is an empty desert , because no one who lives there cares .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	13	The people have planted wheat , but they have harvested only thorns . They have worked hard until they were very tired , but they have nothing for all their work . They are ashamed of their poor harvest , because the Lord ’ s terrible anger has caused this. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	12	14	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Here is what I will do to all my wicked neighbors who take the land I gave my people Israel . I will pull them up and throw them out of their land . And I will pull up the people of Judah from among them .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	15	But after I pull them up , I will feel sorry for them again . I will bring each person back to his own property and to his own land .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	16	I want them to learn their lessons well . In the past they taught my people to swear by Baal ’ s name . But if they will now learn to swear by my name , saying , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives . . . ’ I will allow them to rebuild among my people .
NCV	Jeremiah	12	17	But if a nation will not listen to my message , I will pull it up completely and destroy it , ” says the Lord . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	13	13	Then you will say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will make everyone in this land like a drunken person—the kings who sit on David ’ s throne , the priests and the prophets , and all the people who live in Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a linen belt , just as the Lord told me , and put it around my waist .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	3	Then the Lord spoke his word to me a second time :
NCV	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take the belt you bought and are wearing , and go to Perath . Hide the belt there in a crack in the rocks. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went to Perath and hid the belt there , just as the Lord told me .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	6	Many days later the Lord said to me , “ Now go to Perath and get the belt I told you to hide there. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	13	7	So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from where I had hidden it . But now it was ruined ; it was good for nothing .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the Lord spoke his word to me .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	9	This is what the Lord said : “ In the same way I will ruin the pride of the people of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	10	These evil people refuse to listen to my warnings . They stubbornly do only what they want to do , and they follow other gods to serve and worship them . So they will become like this linen belt—good for nothing .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	11	As a belt is wrapped tightly around a person ’ s waist , I wrapped the families of Israel and Judah around me , ” says the Lord . “ I did that so they would be my people and bring fame , praise , and honor to me . But my people would not listen . Warnings About Leather Wine Bags
NCV	Jeremiah	13	12	“ Say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : All leather bags for holding wine should be filled with wine. ’ People will say to you : ‘ Of course , we know all wine bags should be filled with wine. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	13	14	I will make them smash against one another , fathers and sons alike , says the Lord . I will not feel sorry or have pity on them or show mercy that would stop me from destroying them. ’ ” Threat of Slavery
NCV	Jeremiah	13	15	Listen and pay attention . Don ’ t be too proud , because the Lord has spoken to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings darkness and before you slip and fall on the dark hills . You hope for light , but he will turn it into thick darkness ; he will change it into deep gloom .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	17	If you don ’ t listen to him , I will cry secretly because of your pride . I will cry painfully , and my eyes will overflow with tears , because the Lord ’ s people will be captured .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	18	Tell this to the king and the queen mother : “ Come down from your thrones , because your beautiful crowns have fallen from your heads. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of southern Judah are locked up , and no one can open them . All Judah will be taken as captives to a foreign land ; they will be carried away completely .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	20	Jerusalem , look up and see the people coming from the north . Where is the flock God gave you to care for , the flock you bragged about ?
NCV	Jeremiah	13	21	What will you say when they appoint as your heads those you had thought were your friends ? Won ’ t you have much pain and trouble , like a woman giving birth to a baby ?
NCV	Jeremiah	13	22	You might ask yourself , “ Why has this happened to me ? ” It happened because of your many sins . Because of your sins , your skirt was torn off and your body has been treated badly .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	23	Can a person from Cush change the color of his skin ? Can a leopard change his spots ? In the same way , Jerusalem , you can not change and do good , because you are accustomed to doing evil .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	24	“ I will scatter you like chaff that is blown away by the desert wind .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	25	This is what will happen to you ; this is your part in my plans , ” says the Lord . “ Because you forgot me and trusted in false gods ,
NCV	Jeremiah	13	26	I will pull your skirts up over your face so everyone will see your shame .
NCV	Jeremiah	13	27	I have seen the terrible things you have done : your acts of adultery and your snorting , your prostitution , your hateful acts on the hills and in the fields .

NCV	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said to me , “ Those prophets are prophesying lies in my name . I did not send them or appoint them or speak to them . They have been prophesying false visions , idolatries , worthless magic , and their own wishful thinking .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	2	“ The nation of Judah cries as if someone has died , and her cities are very sad . They are distressed over the land . A cry goes up to God from Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	3	The important men send their servants to get water . They go to the wells , but they find no water . So they return with empty jars . They are ashamed and embarrassed and cover their heads in shame .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	4	The ground is dry and cracked open , because no rain falls on the land . The farmers are upset and sad , so they cover their heads in shame .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	5	Even the mother deer in the field leaves her newborn fawn to die , because there is no grass .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	6	Wild donkeys stand on the bare hills and sniff the wind like wild dogs . But their eyes go blind , because there is no food. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	14	7	We know that we suffer because of our sins . Lord , do something to help us for the good of your name . We have left you many times ; we have sinned against you .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	8	God , the Hope of Israel , you have saved Israel in times of trouble . Why are you like a stranger in the land , or like a traveler who only stays one night ?
NCV	Jeremiah	14	9	Why are you like someone who has been attacked by surprise , like a warrior who is not able to save anyone ? But you are among us , Lord , and we are called by your name so don ’ t leave us without help !
NCV	Jeremiah	14	10	This is what the Lord says about the people of Judah : “ They really love to wander from me ; they don ’ t stop themselves from leaving me . So now the Lord will not accept them . He will now remember the evil they do and will punish them for their sins. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	14	11	Then the Lord said , “ Don ’ t pray for good things to happen to the people of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	12	Even if they fast , I will not listen to their prayers . Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings to me , I will not accept them . Instead , I will destroy the people of Judah with war , hunger , and terrible diseases. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	14	13	But I said , “ Oh , Lord God , the prophets keep telling the people , ‘ You will not suffer from an enemy ’ s sword or from hunger . I , the Lord , will give you peace in this land. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	14	15	So this is what I say about the prophets who are prophesying in my name . I did not send them . They say , ‘ No enemy will attack this country with swords . There will never be hunger in this land. ’ So those prophets will die from hunger and from an enemy ’ s sword .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people to whom the prophets speak will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem . There they will die from hunger and from an enemy ’ s sword . And no one will be there to bury them , or their wives , or their sons , or their daughters . I will punish them .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	17	“ Jeremiah , speak this message to the people of Judah : ‘ Let my eyes be filled with tears night and day , without stopping . My people have received a terrible blow ; they have been hurt badly .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go into the country , I see people killed by swords . If I go into the city , I see much sickness , because the people have no food . Both the priests and the prophets have been taken to a foreign land. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	14	19	Lord , have you completely rejected the nation of Judah ? Do you hate Jerusalem ? Why have you hurt us so badly that we can not be made well again ? We hoped for peace , but nothing good has come . We looked for a time of healing , but only terror came .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	20	Lord , we admit that we are wicked and that our ancestors did evil things . We have sinned against you .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	21	For your sake , do not hate us . Do not take away the honor from your glorious throne . Remember your agreement with us , and do not break it .
NCV	Jeremiah	14	22	Do foreign idols have the power to bring rain ? Does the sky itself have the power to send down showers ? No , it is you , Lord our God . You are our only hope , because you are the one who made all these things . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	15	15	Lord , you understand . Remember me and take care of me . Punish for me those who are hurting me . Don ’ t destroy me while you remain patient with them . Think about the shame I suffer for you .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	2	When they ask you , ‘ Where will we go ? ’ tell them : ‘ This is what the Lord says : Those who are meant to die will die . Those who are meant to die in war will die in war . Those who are meant to die from hunger will die from hunger . Those who are meant to be taken captive will be taken captive. ’

NCV	Jeremiah	15	4	I will make the people of Judah hated by everyone on earth because of what Manasseh did in Jerusalem . ( Manasseh son of Hezekiah was king of the nation of Judah . )
NCV	Jeremiah	15	5	“ Who will feel sorry for you , Jerusalem ? Who will be sad and cry for you ? Who will go out of his way to ask how you are ?
NCV	Jeremiah	15	6	Jerusalem , you have left me , ” says the Lord . “ You keep going farther and farther away , so I have taken hold of you and destroyed you . I was tired of holding back my anger .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	7	I have separated the people of Judah with my pitchfork and scattered them at the city gates of the land . My people haven ’ t changed their ways . So I have destroyed them and taken away their children .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	8	There are more widows than grains of sand in the sea . I brought a destroyer at noontime against the mothers of the young men of Judah . I suddenly brought pain and fear on the people of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	9	When the enemy attacked , a woman with seven sons felt faint because they would all die . She became weak and unable to breathe . Her bright day became dark from sadness . She felt shame and disgrace . And everyone else left alive in Judah I will hand over to the enemies , too ! ” says the Lord . Jeremiah ’ s Second Complaint
NCV	Jeremiah	15	10	Mother , I am sorry that you gave birth to me since I must accuse and criticize the whole land . I have not loaned or borrowed anything , but everyone curses me .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	11	The Lord said , “ I have saved you for a good reason . I have made your enemies beg you in times of disaster and trouble .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	12	No one can smash a piece of iron or bronze that comes from the north .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	13	Your wealth and treasures I will give to others free of charge , because the people of Judah have sinned throughout the country .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	14	I will make you slaves to your enemies in a land you have never known . My anger is like a hot fire , and it will burn against you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	15	16	Your words came to me , and I listened carefully to them . Your words made me very happy , because I am called by your name , Lord God All-Powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	17	I never sat with the crowd as they laughed and had fun . I sat by myself , because you were there , and you filled me with anger at the evil around me .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	18	I don ’ t understand why my pain has no end . I don ’ t understand why my injury is not cured or healed . Will you be like a brook that goes dry ? Will you be like a spring that stops flowing ?
NCV	Jeremiah	15	19	So this is what the Lord says : “ If you change your heart and return to me , I will take you back . Then you may serve me . And if you speak things that have worth , not useless words , then you may speak for me . Let the people of Judah turn to you , but you must not change and be like them .
NCV	Jeremiah	15	20	I will make you as strong as a wall to this people , as strong as a wall of bronze . They will fight against you , but they will not defeat you , because I am with you . I will rescue you and save you , ” says the Lord .

After that , I will send for many hunters to come to this land . And they will hunt the people of Judah on every mountain and hill and in the cracks of the rocks .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	2	“ You must not get married or have sons or daughters in this place. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	16	3	The Lord says this about the sons and daughters born in this land and their mothers and fathers :
NCV	Jeremiah	16	4	“ They will die of terrible diseases , and no one will cry for them or bury them . Their bodies will lie on the ground like dung . They will die in war , or they will starve to death . Their bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	16	5	So this is what the Lord says : “ Jeremiah , do not go into a house where there is a funeral meal . Do not go there to cry for the dead or to show your sorrow for them , because I have taken back my blessing , my love , and my pity from these people , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	6	“ Important people and common people will die in the land of Judah . No one will bury them or cry for them or cut himself or shave his head to show sorrow for them .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	7	No one will bring food to comfort those who are crying for the dead . No one will offer a drink to comfort someone whose mother or father has died .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	8	“ Do not go into a house where the people are having a feast to sit down to eat and drink ,

NCV	Jeremiah	16	10	“ When you tell the people of Judah these things , they will ask you , ‘ Why has the Lord said these terrible things to us ? What have we done wrong ? What sin have we done against the Lord our God ? ’
NCV	Jeremiah	16	11	“ Then say to them : ‘ This is because your ancestors quit following me , ’ says the Lord . ‘ And they followed other gods and served and worshiped them . Your ancestors left me and quit obeying my teaching .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	12	But you have done even more evil than your ancestors . You are very stubborn and do only what you want to do ; you have not obeyed me .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	13	So I will throw you out of this country and send you into a land that you and your ancestors never knew . There you can serve other gods day and night , because I will not help you or show you any favors. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	16	14	“ People say , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought the people of Israel out of Egypt . . . ’ But the time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when people will not say this anymore .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	15	They will say instead , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought the Israelites from the northern land and from all the countries where he had sent them . . . ’ And I will bring them back to the land I gave to their ancestors .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	17	I see everything they do . They can not hide from me the things they do ; their sin is not hidden from my eyes .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	18	I will pay back the people of Judah twice for every one of their sins , because they have made my land unclean . They have filled my country with their hateful idols. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	16	19	Lord , you are my strength and my protection , my safe place in times of trouble . The nations will come to you from all over the world and say , “ Our ancestors had only false gods , useless idols that didn ’ t help them .
NCV	Jeremiah	16	20	Can people make gods for themselves ? They will not really be gods ! ”

NCV	Jeremiah	17	2	Even their children remember their altars to idols and their Asherah idols beside the green trees and on the high hills .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	3	My mountain in the open country and your wealth and treasures I will give away to other people . I will give away the places of worship in your country , because you sinned by worshiping there .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	4	You will lose the land I gave you , and it is your own fault . I will let your enemies take you as their slaves to a land you have never known . This is because you have made my anger burn like a hot fire , and it will burn forever. ” Trusting in Humans or God
NCV	Jeremiah	17	5	This is what the Lord says : “ A curse is placed on those who trust other people , who depend on humans for strength , who have stopped trusting the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	6	They are like a bush in a desert that grows in a land where no one lives , a hot and dry land with bad soil . They don ’ t know about the good things God can give .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	7	“ But the person who trusts in the Lord will be blessed . The Lord will show him that he can be trusted .

NCV	Jeremiah	17	9	“ More than anything else , a person ’ s mind is evil and can not be healed . Who can understand it ?
NCV	Jeremiah	17	10	But I , the Lord , look into a person ’ s heart and test the mind . So I can decide what each one deserves ; I can give each one the right payment for what he does. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	17	11	Like a bird hatching an egg it did not lay , so are the people who get rich by cheating . When their lives are half finished , they will lose their riches . At the end of their lives , it will be clear they were fools .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	12	From the beginning , our Temple has been honored as a glorious throne for God .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	13	Lord , hope of Israel , those who leave you will be shamed . People who quit following the Lord will be like a name written in the dust , because they have left the Lord , the spring of living water . Jeremiah ’ s Third Complaint
NCV	Jeremiah	17	14	Lord , heal me , and I will truly be healed . Save me , and I will truly be saved . You are the one I praise .

NCV	Jeremiah	17	16	Lord , I didn ’ t run away from being the shepherd you wanted . I didn ’ t want the terrible day to come . You know everything I have said ; you see all that is happening .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	18	Make those who are hurting me be ashamed , but don ’ t bring shame to me . Let them be terrified , but keep me from terror . Bring the day of disaster on my enemies . Destroy them , and destroy them again . Keeping the Sabbath Holy
NCV	Jeremiah	17	19	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Go and stand at the People ’ s Gate of Jerusalem , where the kings of Judah go in and out . And then go to all the other gates of Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	20	Say to them there : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord , kings of Judah , all you people of Judah , and all who live in Jerusalem , who come through these gates into the city .

NCV	Jeremiah	17	22	Don ’ t take a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or do any work on that day . But keep the Sabbath as a holy day , as I commanded your ancestors .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	23	But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me . They were very stubborn and did not listen . I punished them , but it didn ’ t do any good .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	24	But you must be careful to obey me , says the Lord . You must not bring a load through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath , but you must keep the Sabbath as a holy day and not do any work on that day .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	25	“ ‘ If you obey this command , kings who sit on David ’ s throne will come through the gates of Jerusalem with their officers . They will come riding in chariots and on horses , along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem . And the city of Jerusalem will have people living in it forever .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	26	People will come to Jerusalem from the villages around it , from the towns of Judah , from the land of Benjamin , from the western hills , from the mountains , and from southern Judah . They will all bring to the Temple of the Lord burnt offerings , sacrifices , grain offerings , incense , and offerings to show thanks to God .
NCV	Jeremiah	17	27	But you must obey me and keep the Sabbath day as a holy day . You must not carry any loads into Jerusalem on the Sabbath . If you don ’ t obey me , I will start a fire at the gates of Jerusalem , and it will burn until it burns even the strong towers . And it will not be put out. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	18	18	Then the people said , “ Come , let ’ s make plans against Jeremiah . Surely the teaching of the law by the priest will not be lost . We will still have the advice from the wise teachers and the words of the prophets . So let ’ s ruin him by telling lies about him . We won ’ t pay attention to anything he says. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Go down to the potter ’ s house , and I will give you my message there. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to the potter ’ s house and saw him working at the potter ’ s wheel .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	4	He was using his hands to make a pot from clay , but something went wrong with it . So he used that clay to make another pot the way he wanted it to be .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the Lord spoke his word to me :
NCV	Jeremiah	18	6	“ Family of Israel , can ’ t I do the same thing with you ? ” says the Lord . “ You are in my hands like the clay in the potter ’ s hands .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	7	There may come a time when I will speak about a nation or a kingdom that I will pull up by its roots or that I will pull down to destroy it .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	8	But if the people of that nation stop doing the evil they have done , I will change my mind and not carry out my plans to bring disaster to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	9	There may come another time when I will speak about a nation that I will build up and plant .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	10	But if I see it doing evil by not obeying me , I will change my mind and not carry out my plans to do good for them .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	11	“ So , say this to the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem : ‘ This is what the Lord says : I am preparing disaster for you and making plans against you . So stop doing evil . Change your ways and do what is right. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	18	12	But the people of Judah will answer , ‘ It won ’ t do any good to try ! We will continue to do what we want . Each of us will do what his stubborn , evil heart wants ! ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	18	13	So this is what the Lord says : “ Ask the people in other nations this question : ‘ Have you ever heard anything like this ? ’ The people of Israel have done a horrible thing .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	14	The snow on the mountains of Lebanon never melts from the rocks . Its cool , flowing streams do not dry up .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	15	But my people have forgotten me . They burn incense to worthless idols and have stumbled in what they do and in the old ways of their ancestors . They walk along back roads and on poor highways .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	16	So Judah ’ s country will become an empty desert . People will not stop making fun of it . They will shake their heads as they pass by ; they will be shocked at how the country was destroyed .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	17	Like a strong east wind , I will scatter them before their enemies . At that awful time they will not see me coming to help them ; they will see me leaving. ” Jeremiah ’ s Fourth Complaint
NCV	Jeremiah	18	19	Lord , listen to me . Listen to what my accusers are saying !
NCV	Jeremiah	18	20	Good should not be paid back with evil , but they have dug a pit in order to kill me . Remember that I stood before you and asked you to do good things for these people and to turn your anger away from them .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	21	So now , let their children starve , and let their enemies kill them with swords . Let their wives lose their children and husbands . Let the men from Judah be put to death and the young men be killed with swords in battle .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	22	Let them cry out in their houses when you bring an enemy against them suddenly . Let all this happen , because my enemies have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden traps for my feet .
NCV	Jeremiah	18	23	Lord , you know about all their plans to kill me . Don ’ t forgive their crimes or erase their sins from your mind . Make them fall from their places ; punish them while you are angry . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	19	19	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Go and buy a clay jar from a potter .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	2	Take some of the elders of the people and the priests , and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom , near the front of the Potsherd Gate . There speak the words I tell you .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	3	Say , ‘ Kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem , listen to this message from the Lord . This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : I will soon bring a disaster on this place that will amaze and frighten everyone who hears about it .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	4	The people of Judah have quit following me . They have made this a place for foreign gods . They have burned sacrifices to other gods that neither they , nor their ancestors , nor the kings of Judah had ever known before . They filled this place with the blood of innocent people .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	5	They have built places on hilltops to worship Baal , where they burn their children in the fire to Baal . That is something I did not command or speak about ; it never even entered my mind .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	6	Now people call this place the Valley of Ben Hinnom or Topheth , but the days are coming , says the Lord , when people will call it the Valley of Killing .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	7	“ ‘ At this place I will ruin the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem . The enemy will chase them , and I will have them killed with swords . I will make their dead bodies food for the birds and wild animals .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	8	I will completely destroy this city . People will make fun of it and shake their heads when they pass by . They will be shocked when they see how the city was destroyed .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	9	An enemy army will surround the city and will not let anyone go out to get food . I will make the people so hungry that they will eat the bodies of their own sons and daughters , and then they will begin to eat each other. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	19	10	“ While the people with you are watching , break that jar .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	11	Then say this : ‘ The Lord All-Powerful says : I will break this nation and this city just as someone breaks a clay jar that can not be put back together again . The dead people will be buried here in Topheth , because there is no other place for them .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	12	This is what I will do to these people and to this place , says the Lord . I will make this city like Topheth .
NCV	Jeremiah	19	13	The houses in Jerusalem and the king ’ s palaces will become as unclean as this place , Topheth , because the people worshiped gods on the roofs [ a ] of their houses . They worshiped the stars and burned incense to honor them and gave drink offerings to gods. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	19	14	When Jeremiah left Topheth where the Lord had sent him to prophesy , he went to the Lord ’ s Temple , stood in the courtyard , and said to all the people :
NCV	Jeremiah	19	15	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I will soon bring disaster to Jerusalem and the villages around it , as I said I would . This will happen because the people are very stubborn and do not listen at all to what I say. ’ ” Footnotes - 19:13 roofs In Bible times houses were built with flat roofs . The roof was used for drying things such as flax and fruit . And it was used as an extra room , as a place for worship , and as a cool place to sleep in the summer .

NCV	Jeremiah	20	20	Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the highest officer in the Temple of the Lord . When he heard Jeremiah prophesying in the Temple courtyard ,
NCV	Jeremiah	20	2	he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten . And he locked Jeremiah ’ s hands and feet between large blocks of wood at the Upper Gate of Benjamin of the Lord ’ s Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day when Pashhur took Jeremiah out of the blocks of wood , Jeremiah said to him , “ The Lord ’ s name for you is not Pashhur . Now his name for you is Terror on Every Side .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	4	This is what the Lord says : ‘ I will soon make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends . You will watch enemies killing your friends with swords . And I will give all the people of Judah to the king of Babylon , who will take them away as captives to Babylon and then will kill them with swords .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	5	I will give all the wealth of this city to its enemies—its goods , its valuables , and the treasures of the kings of Judah . The enemies will carry all those valuables off to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	6	And Pashhur , you and everyone in your house will be taken captive . You will be forced to go to Babylon , where you will die and be buried , you and your friends to whom you have prophesied lies. ’ ” Jeremiah ’ s Fifth Complaint
NCV	Jeremiah	20	7	Lord , you tricked me , and I was fooled . You are stronger than I am , so you won . I have become a joke ; everyone makes fun of me all day long .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	8	Every time I speak , I shout . I am always shouting about violence and destruction . I tell the people about the message I received from the Lord , but this only brings me insults . The people make fun of me all day long .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	9	Sometimes I say to myself , “ I will forget about the Lord . I will not speak anymore in his name. ” But then his message becomes like a burning fire inside me , deep within my bones . I get tired of trying to hold it inside of me , and finally , I can not hold it in .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	10	I hear many people whispering about me : “ Terror on every side ! Tell on him ! Let ’ s tell the rulers about him. ” My friends are all just waiting for me to make some mistake . They are saying , “ Maybe we can trick him so we can defeat him and pay him back. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord is with me like a strong warrior , so those who are chasing me will trip and fall ; they will not defeat me . They will be ashamed because they have failed , and their shame will never be forgotten .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	12	Lord All-Powerful , you test good people ; you look deeply into the heart and mind of a person . I have told you my arguments against these people , so let me see you give them the punishment they deserve .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing to the Lord ! Praise the Lord ! He saves the life of the poor from the power of the wicked . Jeremiah ’ s Sixth Complaint
NCV	Jeremiah	20	14	Let there be a curse on the day I was born ; let there be no blessing on the day when my mother gave birth to me .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	15	Let there be a curse on the man who brought my father the news : “ You have a son ! ” This made my father very glad .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	16	Let that man be like the towns the Lord destroyed without pity . Let him hear loud crying in the morning and battle cries at noon ,
NCV	Jeremiah	20	17	because he did not kill me before I was born . Then my mother would have been my grave ; she would have stayed pregnant forever .
NCV	Jeremiah	20	18	Why did I have to come out of my mother ’ s body ? All I have known is trouble and sorrow , and my life will end in shame . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	21	21	This is the word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah . It came when Zedekiah king of Judah sent Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	2	They said , “ Ask the Lord for us what will happen , because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us . Maybe the Lord will do miracles for us as he did in the past so Nebuchadnezzar will stop attacking us and leave. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	21	3	But Jeremiah answered them , “ Tell King Zedekiah this :
NCV	Jeremiah	21	4	‘ Here is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : You have weapons of war in your hands to defend yourselves against the king of Babylon and the Babylonians , who are all around the city wall . But I will make those weapons useless . Soon I will bring them into the center of this city .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	5	In my anger , my very great anger , I myself will fight against you with my great power and strength .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	6	I will kill everything living in Jerusalem—both people and animals . They will die from terrible diseases .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	7	Then , says the Lord , I ’ ll hand over Zedekiah king of Judah , his officers , and the people in Jerusalem who do not die from the terrible diseases or battle or hunger , to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . I will let those win who want to kill the people of Judah , so the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be killed in war . Nebuchadnezzar will not show any mercy or pity or feel sorry for them ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	21	8	“ Also tell this to the people of Jerusalem : ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will let you choose to live or die .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	9	Anyone who stays in Jerusalem will die in war or from hunger or from a terrible disease . But anyone who goes out of Jerusalem and surrenders to the Babylonians who are attacking you will live . Anyone who leaves the city will save his life as if it were a prize won in war .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	10	I have decided to make trouble for this city and not to help it , says the Lord . I will give it to the king of Babylon , and he will burn it with fire. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	21	11	“ Say to Judah ’ s royal family : ‘ Hear the word of the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	12	Family of David , this is what the Lord says : You must judge people fairly every morning . Save the person who has been robbed from the power of his attacker . If you don ’ t , I will become very angry . My anger will be like a fire that no one can put out , because you have done evil things .
NCV	Jeremiah	21	13	“ ‘ Jerusalem , I am against you , you who live on top of the mountain over this valley , says the Lord . You say , “ No one can attack us or come into our strong city. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	21	14	But I will give you the punishment you deserve , says the Lord . I will start a fire in your forests that will burn up everything around you ! ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	22	22	Like a storm , my punishment will blow all your shepherds away and send your friends into captivity . Then you will really be ashamed and disgraced because of all the wicked things you did .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	2	‘ Hear the word of the Lord , king of Judah , who rules from David ’ s throne . You and your officers , and your people who come through these gates , listen !
NCV	Jeremiah	22	3	This is what the Lord says : Do what is fair and right . Save the one who has been robbed from the power of his attacker . Don ’ t mistreat or hurt the foreigners , orphans , or widows . Don ’ t kill innocent people here .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	4	If you carefully obey these commands , kings who sit on David ’ s throne will come through the gates of this palace with their officers and people , riding in chariots and on horses .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	5	But if you don ’ t obey these commands , says the Lord , I swear by my own name that this king ’ s palace will become a ruin. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	22	6	This is what the Lord says about the palace where the king of Judah lives : “ You are tall like the forests of Gilead , like the mountaintops of Lebanon . But I will truly make you into a desert , into towns where no one lives .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	7	I will send men to destroy the palace , each with his weapons . They will cut up your strong , beautiful cedar beams and throw them into the fire .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	8	“ People from many nations will pass by this city and ask each other , ‘ Why has the Lord done such a terrible thing to Jerusalem , this great city ? ’
NCV	Jeremiah	22	9	And the answer will be : ‘ Because the people of Judah quit following the agreement with the Lord their God . They worshiped and served other gods. ’ ” Judgment Against Jehoahaz
NCV	Jeremiah	22	10	Don ’ t cry for the dead king or be sad about him . But cry painfully for the king who is being taken away , because he will never return or see his homeland again .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	11	This is what the Lord says about Jehoahaz son of Josiah who became king of Judah after his father died and who has left this place : “ He will never return .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	12	He will die where he has been taken captive , and he will not see this land again. ” Judgment Against Jehoiakim
NCV	Jeremiah	22	13	“ How terrible it will be for one who builds his palace by doing evil , who cheats people so he can build its upper rooms . He makes his own people work for nothing and does not pay them .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	14	He says , ‘ I will build a great palace for myself with large upper rooms. ’ So he builds it with large windows and uses cedar wood for the walls , which he paints red .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	15	“ Does having a lot of cedar in your house make you a great king ? Your father was satisfied to have food and drink . He did what was right and fair , so everything went well for him .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	16	He helped those who were poor and needy , so everything went well for him . That is what it means to know God , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	17	“ But you only look for and think about what you can get dishonestly . You are even willing to kill innocent people to get it . You feel free to hurt people and to steal from them. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	22	18	So this is what the Lord says to Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah : “ The people of Judah will not cry when Jehoiakim dies , saying : ‘ Oh , my brother , ’ or ‘ Oh , my sister. ’ They will not cry for him , saying : ‘ Oh , master , ’ or ‘ Oh , my king. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	22	19	They will bury him like a donkey , dragging his body away and throwing it outside the gates of Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	20	“ Judah , go up to Lebanon and cry out . Let your voice be heard in Bashan . Cry out from Abarim , because all your friends are destroyed !
NCV	Jeremiah	22	21	Judah , when you were successful , I warned you , but you said , ‘ I won ’ t listen. ’ You have acted like this since you were young ; you have not obeyed me .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	23	King , you live in your palace , cozy in your rooms of cedar . But when your punishment comes , how you will groan like a woman giving birth to a baby ! Judgment upon Jehoiachin
NCV	Jeremiah	22	24	“ As surely as I live , ” says the Lord , “ Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah , even if you were a signet ring on my right hand , I would still pull you off .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	25	I will hand you over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to the Babylonians—those people you fear because they want to kill you .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	26	I will throw you and your mother into another country . Neither of you was born there , but both of you will die there .
NCV	Jeremiah	22	27	They will want to come back , but they will never be able to return. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	22	28	Jehoiachin is like a broken pot someone threw away ; he is like something no one wants . Why will Jehoiachin and his children be thrown out and sent into a foreign land ?
NCV	Jeremiah	22	29	Land , land , land of Judah , hear the word of the Lord !
NCV	Jeremiah	22	30	This is what the Lord says : “ Write this down in the record about Jehoiachin : He is a man without children , a man who will not be successful in his lifetime . And none of his descendants will be successful ; none will sit on the throne of David or rule in Judah. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	23	23	“ I am a God who is near , ” says the Lord . “ I am also a God who is far away .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	2	They are responsible for the people , so the Lord , the God of Israel , says to them : “ You have scattered my people and forced them away and not taken care of them . So I will punish you for the evil things you have done , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	3	“ I sent my people to other countries , but I will gather those who are left alive and bring them back to their own country . Then they will have many children and grow in number .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	4	I will place new leaders over my people , who will take care of them . And my people will not be afraid or terrified again , and none of them will be lost , ” says the Lord . The Good Branch Will Come
NCV	Jeremiah	23	5	“ The days are coming , ” says the Lord , “ when I will raise up a good branch in David ’ s family . He will be a king who will rule in a wise way ; he will do what is fair and right in the land .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	6	In his time Judah will be saved , and Israel will live in safety . This will be his name : The Lord Does What Is Right .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	7	“ So the days are coming , ” says the Lord , “ when people will not say again : ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought Israel out of Egypt . . . ’
NCV	Jeremiah	23	8	But people will say something new : ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , who brought the descendants of Israel from the land of the north and from all the countries where he had sent them away . . . ’ Then the people of Israel will live in their own land. ” False Prophets Will Be Punished
NCV	Jeremiah	23	9	A message to the prophets : My heart is broken . All my bones shake . I ’ m like someone who is drunk , like someone who has been overcome with wine . This is because of the Lord and his holy words .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	10	The land of Judah is full of people who are guilty of adultery . Because of this , the Lord cursed the land . It has become a very sad place , and the pastures have dried up . The people are evil and use their power in the wrong way .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	11	“ Both the prophets and the priests live as if there were no God . I have found them doing evil things even in my own Temple , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	12	“ So they will be in danger . They will be forced into darkness where they will be defeated . I will bring disaster on them in the year I punish them , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	13	“ I saw the prophets of Samaria do something wrong . Those prophets prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel away .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	14	And I have seen the prophets of Jerusalem do terrible things . They are guilty of adultery and live by lies . They encourage evil people to keep on doing evil , so the people don ’ t stop sinning . All of those people are like the city of Sodom . The people of Jerusalem are like the city of Gomorrah to me ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	23	15	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful says about the prophets : “ I will make those prophets eat bitter food and drink poisoned water , because the prophets of Jerusalem spread wickedness through the whole country. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	23	16	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Don ’ t pay attention to what those prophets are saying to you . They are trying to fool you . They talk about visions their own minds made up , not about visions from me .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	17	They say to those who hate me : ‘ The Lord says : You will have peace. ’ They say to all those who are stubborn and do as they please : ‘ Nothing bad will happen to you. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	23	18	But none of these prophets has stood in the meeting of angels to see or hear the message of the Lord . None of them has paid close attention to his message .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	19	Look , the punishment from the Lord will come like a storm . His anger will be like a hurricane . It will come swirling down on the heads of those wicked people .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	20	The Lord ’ s anger will not stop until he finishes what he plans to do . When that day is over , you will understand this clearly .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	21	I did not send those prophets , but they ran to tell their message . I did not speak to them , but they prophesied anyway .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	22	But if they had stood in the meeting of angels , they would have told my message to my people . They would have turned the people from their evil ways and from doing evil .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	24	No one can hide where I can not see him , ” says the Lord . “ I fill all of heaven and earth , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	25	“ I have heard the prophets who prophesy lies in my name . They say , ‘ I have had a dream ! I have had a dream ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will this continue in the minds of these lying prophets ? They prophesy from their own wishful thinking .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	27	They are trying to make the people of Judah forget me by telling each other these dreams . In the same way , their ancestors forgot me and worshiped Baal .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	28	Is straw the same thing as wheat ? ” says the Lord . “ If a prophet wants to tell about his dreams , let him ! But let the person who hears my message speak it truthfully !
NCV	Jeremiah	23	29	Isn ’ t my message like a fire ? ” says the Lord . “ Isn ’ t it like a hammer that smashes a rock ?
NCV	Jeremiah	23	30	“ So I am against the false prophets , ” says the Lord . “ They keep stealing words from each other and say they are from me .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	31	I am against the false prophets , ” says the Lord . “ They use their own words and pretend it is a message from me .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	32	I am against the prophets who prophesy false dreams , ” says the Lord . “ They mislead my people with their lies and false teachings ! I did not send them or command them to do anything for me . They can ’ t help the people of Judah at all , ” says the Lord . The Sad Message from the Lord
NCV	Jeremiah	23	33	“ Suppose the people of Judah , a prophet , or a priest asks you : ‘ Jeremiah , what is the message from the Lord ? ’ You will answer them and say , ‘ You are a heavy load to the Lord , and I will throw you down , says the Lord. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	23	34	A prophet or a priest or one of the people might say , ‘ This is a message from the Lord. ’ That person has lied , so I will punish him and his whole family .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	35	This is what you will say to each other : ‘ What did the Lord answer ? ’ or ‘ What did the Lord say ? ’
NCV	Jeremiah	23	36	But you will never again say , ‘ The message of the Lord , ’ because the only message you speak is your own words . You have changed the words of our God , the living God , the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	37	This is how you should speak to the prophets : ‘ What answer did the Lord give you ? ’ or ‘ What did the Lord say ? ’
NCV	Jeremiah	23	38	But don ’ t say , ‘ The message from the Lord. ’ If you use these words , this is what the Lord says : Because you called it a ‘ message from the Lord , ’ though I told you not to use those words ,
NCV	Jeremiah	23	39	I will pick you up and throw you away from me , along with Jerusalem , which I gave to your ancestors and to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	23	40	And I will make a disgrace of you forever ; your shame will never be forgotten. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	24	24	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon captured Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim and king of Judah , his officers , and all the craftsmen and metalworkers of Judah . He took them away from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon . It was then that the Lord showed me two baskets of figs arranged in front of the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	2	One of the baskets had very good figs in it , like figs that ripen early in the season . But the other basket had figs too rotten to eat .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	3	The Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I answered , “ I see figs . The good figs are very good , but the rotten figs are too rotten to eat. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	24	4	Then the Lord spoke his word to me :
NCV	Jeremiah	24	5	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I sent the people of Judah out of their country to live in the country of Babylon . I think of those people as good , like these good figs .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	6	I will look after them and bring them back to the land of Judah . I will not tear them down , but I will build them up . I will not pull them up , but I will plant them so they can grow .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	7	I will make them want to know me , that I am the Lord . They will be my people , and I will be their God , because they will return to me with their whole hearts .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	8	“ ‘ But the bad figs are too rotten to eat. ’ So this is what the Lord says : ‘ Zedekiah king of Judah , his officers , and all the people from Jerusalem who are left alive , even those who live in Egypt , will be like those rotten figs .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	9	I will make those people hated as an evil people by all the kingdoms of the earth . People will make fun of them and tell jokes about them and point fingers at them and curse them everywhere I scatter them .
NCV	Jeremiah	24	10	I will send war , hunger , and disease against them . I will attack them until they have all been killed . Then they will no longer be in the land I gave to them and their ancestors. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Jeremiah	24	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	25	all the kings of Zimri , Elam , and Media ;
NCV	Jeremiah	25	2	This is the message Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and Jerusalem :
NCV	Jeremiah	25	3	The Lord has spoken his word to me again and again for these past twenty-three years . I have been a prophet since the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah . I have spoken messages from the Lord to you from that time until today , but you have not listened .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	4	The Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you over and over again , but you have not listened or paid any attention to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	5	Those prophets have said , “ Stop your evil ways . Stop doing what is wrong so you can stay in the land that the Lord gave to you and your ancestors to live in forever .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	6	Don ’ t follow other gods to serve them or to worship them . Don ’ t make me , the Lord , angry by worshiping idols that are the work of your own hands , or I will punish you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	25	7	“ But you people of Judah did not listen to me , ” says the Lord . “ You made me angry by worshiping idols that were the work of your own hands , so I punished you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	25	8	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Since you have not listened to my messages ,
NCV	Jeremiah	25	9	I will send for all the peoples of the north , ” says the Lord , “ along with my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . I will bring them all against Judah , those who live there , and all the nations around you , too . I will completely destroy all those countries and leave them in ruins forever . People will be shocked when they see how badly I have destroyed those countries .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	10	I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and happiness , the sounds of brides and bridegrooms , and the sound of people grinding meal . And I will take away the light of the lamp .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	11	That whole area will be an empty desert , and these nations will be slaves of the king of Babylon for seventy years .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	12	“ But when the seventy years have passed , I will punish the king of Babylon and his entire nation for their evil , ” says the Lord . “ I will make that land a desert forever .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	13	I will make happen all the terrible things I said about Babylonia—everything Jeremiah prophesied about all those foreign nations , the warnings written in this book .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	14	Even the Babylonians will have to serve many nations and many great kings . I will give them the punishment they deserve for all their own hands have done. ” Judgment on the Nations
NCV	Jeremiah	25	15	The Lord , the God of Israel , said this to me : “ My anger is like the wine in a cup . Take it from my hand and make all the nations , to whom I am sending you , drink all of my anger from this cup .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	16	They will drink my anger and stumble about and act like madmen because of the war I am going to send among them. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	25	17	So I took the cup from the Lord ’ s hand and went to those nations and made them drink from it .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	18	I served this wine to the people of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , and the kings and officers of Judah , so they would become a ruin . Then people would be shocked and would insult them and speak evil of them . And so it has been to this day .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	19	I also made these people drink of the Lord ’ s anger : the king of Egypt , his servants , his officers , all his people ,
NCV	Jeremiah	25	20	and all the foreigners there ; all the kings of the land of Uz ; all the kings of the Philistines ( the kings of the cities of Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and the people left at Ashdod ) ;
NCV	Jeremiah	25	21	the people of Edom , Moab , and Ammon ;
NCV	Jeremiah	25	22	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon ; all the kings of the coastal countries to the west ;
NCV	Jeremiah	25	23	the people of Dedan and Tema and Buz ; all who cut their hair short ;
NCV	Jeremiah	25	24	all the kings of Arabia ; and the kings of the people who live in the desert ;
NCV	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the north , near and far , one after the other . I made all the kingdoms on earth drink from the cup of the Lord ’ s anger , but the king of Babylon will drink from this cup after all the others .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	27	“ Then say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Drink this cup of my anger . Get drunk from it and vomit . Fall down and don ’ t get up because of the war I am sending among you ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	25	28	“ If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink , say to them , ‘ The Lord All-Powerful says this : You must drink from this cup .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	29	Look ! I am already bringing disaster on Jerusalem , the city that is called by my name . Do you think you will not be punished ? You will be punished ! I am sending war on all the people of the earth , says the Lord All-Powerful. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	25	30	“ You , Jeremiah , will prophesy against them with all these words . Say to them : ‘ The Lord will roar from heaven and will shout from his Holy Temple . He will roar loudly against his land . He will shout like people who walk on grapes to make wine ; he will shout against all who live on the earth .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	31	The noise will spread all over the earth , because the Lord will accuse all the nations . He will judge and tell what is wrong with all people , and he will kill the evil people with a sword , ’ ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	32	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Disasters will soon spread from nation to nation . They will come like a powerful storm from the faraway places on earth. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	25	33	At that time those killed by the Lord will reach from one end of the earth to the other . No one will cry for them or gather up their bodies and bury them . They will be left lying on the ground like dung .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	34	Cry , you leaders ! Cry out loud ! Roll around in the dust , leaders of the people ! It is now time for you to be killed . You will fall and be scattered , like pieces of a broken jar .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	35	There will be no place for the leaders to hide ; they will not escape .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	36	I hear the sound of the leaders shouting . I hear the leaders of the people crying loudly , because the Lord is destroying their land .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	37	Those peaceful pastures will be like an empty desert , because the Lord is very angry .
NCV	Jeremiah	25	38	Like a lion , he has left his den . Their land has been destroyed because of the terrible war he brought , because of his fierce anger . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	26	26	This message came from the Lord soon after Jehoiakim son of Josiah became king of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	2	This is what the Lord said : “ Jeremiah , stand in the courtyard of the Temple of the Lord . Give this message to all the people of the towns of Judah who are coming to worship at the Temple of the Lord . Tell them everything I tell you to say ; don ’ t leave out a word .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	3	Maybe they will listen and stop their evil ways . If they will , I will change my mind about bringing on them the disaster that I am planning because of the evil they have done .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	4	Say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord says : You must obey me and follow my teachings that I gave you .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	5	You must listen to what my servants the prophets say to you . I have sent them to you again and again , but you did not listen .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	6	If you don ’ t obey me , I will destroy my Temple in Jerusalem as I destroyed my Holy Tent at Shiloh . When I do , people all over the world will curse Jerusalem. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	26	7	The priests , the prophets , and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	8	When Jeremiah finished speaking everything the Lord had commanded him to say , the priests , prophets , and all the people grabbed Jeremiah . They said , “ You must die !
NCV	Jeremiah	26	9	How dare you prophesy in the name of the Lord that this Temple will be destroyed like the one at Shiloh ! How dare you say that Jerusalem will become a desert without anyone to live in it ! ” And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	10	Now when the officers of Judah heard about what was happening , they came out of the king ’ s palace and went up to the Temple of the Lord and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	11	Then the priests and prophets said to the officers and all the other people , “ Jeremiah should be killed . He prophesied against Jerusalem , and you heard him yourselves. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke these words to all the officers of Judah and all the other people : “ The Lord sent me to say everything you have heard about this Temple and this city .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	13	Now change your lives and start doing good and obey the Lord your God . Then he will change his mind and not bring on you the disaster he has told you about .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , I am in your power . Do to me what you think is good and right .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	15	But be sure of one thing . If you kill me , you will be guilty of killing an innocent person . You will make this city and everyone who lives in it guilty , too ! The Lord truly sent me to you to give you this message. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	26	16	Then the officers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets , “ Jeremiah must not be killed . What he told us comes from the Lord our God. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	26	17	Then some of the elders of Judah stood up and said to all the people ,
NCV	Jeremiah	26	18	“ Micah , from the city of Moresheth , was a prophet during the time Hezekiah was king of Judah . Micah said to all the people of Judah , ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : Jerusalem will be plowed like a field . It will become a pile of rocks , and the hill where the Temple stands will be covered with bushes. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	26	19	“ Hezekiah king of Judah and the people of Judah did not kill Micah . You know that Hezekiah feared the Lord and tried to please the Lord . So the Lord changed his mind and did not bring on Judah the disaster he had promised . If we hurt Jeremiah , we will bring a terrible disaster on ourselves ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	26	20	( Now there was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord . His name was Uriah son of Shemaiah from the city of Kiriath Jearim . He preached the same things against Jerusalem and the land of Judah that Jeremiah did .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	21	When King Jehoiakim , all his army officers , and all the leaders of Judah heard Uriah preach , King Jehoiakim wanted to kill Uriah . But Uriah heard about it and was afraid . So he escaped to Egypt .
NCV	Jeremiah	26	22	Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor and some other men to Egypt ,
NCV	Jeremiah	26	23	and they brought Uriah back from Egypt . Then they took him to King Jehoiakim , who had Uriah killed with a sword . His body was thrown into the burial place where poor people are buried . )
NCV	Jeremiah	26	24	Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah . So Ahikam did not hand Jeremiah over to be killed by the people . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	27	27	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah soon after Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	2	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Make a yoke out of straps and poles , and put it on the back of your neck .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	3	Then send messages to the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Tyre , and Sidon by their messengers who have come to Jerusalem to see Zedekiah king of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	4	Tell them to give this message to their masters : ‘ The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ Tell your masters :
NCV	Jeremiah	27	5	I made the earth , its people , and all its animals with my great power and strength . I can give the earth to anyone I want .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	6	Now I have given all these lands to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , my servant . I will make even the wild animals obey him .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	7	All nations will serve Nebuchadnezzar and his son and grandson . Then the time will come for Babylon to be defeated , and many nations and great kings will make Babylon their servant .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	8	“ ‘ “ But if some nations or kingdoms refuse to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and refuse to be under his control , I will punish them with war , hunger , and terrible diseases , says the Lord . I will use Nebuchadnezzar to destroy them .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	9	So don ’ t listen to your false prophets , those who use magic to tell the future , those who explain dreams , the mediums , or magicians . They all tell you , ‘ You will not be slaves to the king of Babylon. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	27	10	They are telling you lies that will cause you to be taken far from your homeland . I will force you to leave your homes , and you will die in another land .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	11	But the nations who put themselves under the control of the king of Babylon and serve him I will let stay in their own country , says the Lord . The people from those nations will live in their own land and farm it. ” ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	27	12	I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah . I said , “ Put yourself under the control of the king of Babylon and serve him , and you will live .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	13	Why should you and your people die from war , hunger , or disease , as the Lord said would happen to those who do not serve the king of Babylon ?
NCV	Jeremiah	27	14	But the false prophets are saying , ‘ You will never be slaves to the king of Babylon. ’ Don ’ t listen to them because they are prophesying lies to you !
NCV	Jeremiah	27	15	‘ I did not send them , ’ says the Lord . ‘ They are prophesying lies and saying the message is from me . So I will send you away , Judah . And you and those prophets who prophesy to you will die. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	27	16	Then I , Jeremiah , said to the priests and all the people , “ This is what the Lord says : Those false prophets are saying , ‘ The Babylonians will soon return what they took from the Temple of the Lord. ’ Don ’ t listen to them ! They are prophesying lies to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	17	Don ’ t listen to those prophets . But serve the king of Babylon , and you will live . There is no reason for you to cause Jerusalem to become a ruin .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	18	If they are prophets and have the message from the Lord , let them pray to the Lord All-Powerful . Let them ask that the items which are still in the Temple of the Lord and in the king ’ s palace and in Jerusalem not be taken away to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	19	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says about those items left in Jerusalem : the pillars , the large bronze bowl , which is called the Sea , the stands that can be moved , and other things .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	20	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take these away when he took as captives Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other important people from Judah and Jerusalem to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	27	21	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says about the items left in the Temple of the Lord and in the king ’ s palace and in Jerusalem :
NCV	Jeremiah	27	22	‘ All of them will also be taken to Babylon . And they will stay there until the day I go to get them , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Then I will bring them back and return them to this place. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	28	28	It was in that same year , in the fifth month of Zedekiah ’ s fourth year as king of Judah , soon after he began to rule . The prophet Hananiah son of Azzur , from the town of Gibeon , spoke to me in the Temple of the Lord in front of the priests and all the people . He said :
NCV	Jeremiah	28	2	“ The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I have broken the yoke the king of Babylon has put on Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	3	Before two years are over , I will bring back everything that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took to Babylon from the Lord ’ s Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	4	I will also bring back Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other captives from Judah who went to Babylon , ’ says the Lord . ‘ So I will break the yoke the king of Babylon put on Judah. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people who were standing in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	6	He said , “ Amen ! Let the Lord really do that ! May the Lord make the message you prophesy come true . May he bring back here everything from the Lord ’ s Temple and all the people who were taken as captives to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	7	“ But listen to what I am going to say to you and all the people .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	8	There were prophets long before we became prophets , Hananiah . They prophesied that war , hunger , and terrible diseases would come to many countries and great kingdoms .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	9	But if a prophet prophesies that we will have peace and that message comes true , he can be recognized as one truly sent by the Lord. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	28	10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off Jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	11	Hananiah said in front of all the people , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . He put that yoke on all the nations of the world , but I will break it before two years are over. ’ ” After Hananiah had said that , Jeremiah left the Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	12	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off of the prophet Jeremiah ’ s neck .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	13	The Lord said , “ Go and tell Hananiah , ‘ This is what the Lord says : You have broken a wooden yoke , but I will make a yoke of iron in its place !
NCV	Jeremiah	28	14	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : I will put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and they will be slaves to him . I will even give Nebuchadnezzar control over the wild animals. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	28	15	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah , “ Listen , Hananiah ! The Lord did not send you , and you have made the people of Judah trust in lies .
NCV	Jeremiah	28	16	So this is what the Lord says : ‘ Soon I will remove you from the earth . You will die this year , because you taught the people to turn against the Lord. ’ ”

NCV	Jeremiah	29	29	Zephaniah the priest read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	2	( This letter was sent after all these people were taken away : Jehoiachin the king and the queen mother ; the officers and leaders of Judah and Jerusalem ; and the craftsmen and metalworkers from Jerusalem . )
NCV	Jeremiah	29	3	Zedekiah king of Judah sent Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . So Jeremiah gave them this letter to carry to Babylon :
NCV	Jeremiah	29	4	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says to all those people I sent away from Jerusalem as captives to Babylon :
NCV	Jeremiah	29	5	“ Build houses and settle in the land . Plant gardens and eat the food they grow .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	6	Get married and have sons and daughters . Find wives for your sons , and let your daughters be married so they also may have sons and daughters . Have many children in Babylon ; don ’ t become fewer in number .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	7	Also do good things for the city where I sent you as captives . Pray to the Lord for the city where you are living , because if good things happen in the city , good things will happen to you also. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	29	8	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ Don ’ t let the prophets among you and the people who do magic fool you . Don ’ t listen to their dreams .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	9	They are prophesying lies to you , saying that their message is from me . But I did not send them , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	10	This is what the Lord says : “ Babylon will be powerful for seventy years . After that time I will come to you , and I will keep my promise to bring you back to Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	11	I say this because I know what I am planning for you , ” says the Lord . “ I have good plans for you , not plans to hurt you . I will give you hope and a good future .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	12	Then you will call my name . You will come to me and pray to me , and I will listen to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	13	You will search for me . And when you search for me with all your heart , you will find me !
NCV	Jeremiah	29	14	I will let you find me , ” says the Lord . “ And I will bring you back from your captivity . I forced you to leave this place , but I will gather you from all the nations , from the places I have sent you as captives , ” says the Lord . “ And I will bring you back to this place. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	29	15	You might say , “ The Lord has given us prophets here in Babylon. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	29	16	But the Lord says this about the king who is sitting on David ’ s throne now and all the other people still in Jerusalem , your relatives who did not go as captives to Babylon with you .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	17	The Lord All-Powerful says : “ I will soon send war , hunger , and terrible diseases against those still in Jerusalem . I will make them like bad figs that are too rotten to eat .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	18	I will chase them with war , hunger , and terrible diseases . I will make them hated by all the kingdoms of the earth . People will curse them and be shocked and will use them as a shameful example wherever I make them go .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	19	This is because they have not listened to my message , ” says the Lord . “ I sent my message to them again and again through my servants , the prophets , but they did not listen , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	20	You captives , whom I forced to leave Jerusalem and go to Babylon , listen to the message from the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	21	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says this about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah : “ These two men have been prophesying lies to you , saying that their message is from me . But soon I will hand over those two prophets to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and he will kill them in front of you .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	22	Because of them , all the captives from Judah in Babylon will use this curse : ‘ May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab , whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	29	23	They have done evil things among the people of Israel . They are guilty of adultery with their neighbors ’ wives . They have also spoken lies and said those lies were a message from me . I did not tell them to do that . I know what they have done ; I am a witness to it , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	24	Also give a message to Shemaiah from the Nehelamite family .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	25	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ Shemaiah , you sent letters in your name to all the people in Jerusalem , to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah , and to all the priests .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	26	You said to Zephaniah , ‘ The Lord has made you priest in place of Jehoiada . You are to be in charge of the Temple of the Lord . You should arrest any madman who acts like a prophet . Lock his hands and feet between wooden blocks , and put iron rings around his neck .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	27	Now Jeremiah from Anathoth is acting like a prophet . So why haven ’ t you arrested him ?
NCV	Jeremiah	29	28	Jeremiah has sent this message to us in Babylon : You will be there for a long time , so build houses and settle down . Plant gardens and eat what they grow. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	29	30	Then the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah :
NCV	Jeremiah	29	31	“ Send this message to all the captives in Babylon : ‘ This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite : Shemaiah has prophesied to you , but I did not send him . He has made you believe a lie .
NCV	Jeremiah	29	32	So the Lord says , I will soon punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his family . He will not see the good things I will do for my people , says the Lord . None of his family will be left alive among the people , because he has taught the people to turn against me. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	30	30	These are the words that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	2	The Lord , the God of Israel , said : “ Jeremiah , write in a book all the words I have spoken to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	3	The days will come when I will bring Israel and Judah back from captivity , ” says the Lord . “ I will return them to the land I gave their ancestors , and they will own it ! ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	4	The Lord spoke this message about the people of Israel and Judah :
NCV	Jeremiah	30	5	This is what the Lord said : “ We hear people crying from fear . They are afraid ; there is no peace .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask this question , and consider it : A man can not have a baby . So why do I see every strong man holding his stomach in pain like a woman having a baby ? Why is everyone ’ s face turning white like a dead man ’ s face ?
NCV	Jeremiah	30	7	This will be a terrible day ! There will never be another time like this . This is a time of great trouble for the people of Jacob , but they will be saved from it. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	30	8	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ At that time I will break the yoke from their necks and tear off the ropes that hold them . Foreign people will never again make my people slaves .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	9	They will serve the Lord their God and David their king , whom I will send to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	10	“ So people of Jacob , my servants , don ’ t be afraid . Israel , don ’ t be frightened , ” says the Lord . “ I will soon save you from that faraway place where you are captives . I will save your family from that land . The people of Jacob will be safe and have peace again ; there will be no enemy to frighten them .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	11	I am with you and will save you , ” says the Lord . “ I will completely destroy all those nations where I scattered you , but I will not completely destroy you . I will punish you fairly , but I will still punish you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	30	12	This is what the Lord said : “ You people have a wound that can not be cured ; your injury will not heal .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	13	There is no one to argue your case and no cure for your sores . So you will not be healed .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	14	All those nations who were your friends have forgotten you . They don ’ t care about you . I have hurt you as an enemy would . I punished you very hard , because your guilt was so great and your sins were so many .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	15	Why are you crying out about your injury ? There is no cure for your pain . I did these things to you because of your great guilt , because of your many sins .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	16	But all those nations that destroyed you will now be destroyed . All your enemies will become captives in other lands . Those who stole from you will have their own things stolen . Those who took things from you in war will have their own things taken .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	17	I will bring back your health and heal your injuries , ” says the Lord , “ because other people forced you away . They said about you , ‘ No one cares about Jerusalem ! ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	30	18	This is what the Lord said : “ I will soon make the tents of Jacob ’ s people as they used to be , and I will have pity on Israel ’ s houses . The city will be rebuilt on its hill of ruins , and the king ’ s palace will stand in its proper place .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	19	People in those places will sing songs of praise . There will be the sound of laughter . I will give them many children so their number will not be small . I will bring honor to them so no one will look down on them .
NCV	Jeremiah	30	20	Their descendants will be as they were in the old days . I will set them up as a strong people before me , and I will punish the nations who have hurt them .

NCV	Jeremiah	31	31	“ Look , the time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	2	This is what the Lord says : “ The people who were not killed by the enemy ’ s sword found help in the desert . I came to give rest to Israel. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	31	3	And from far away the Lord appeared to his people and said , “ I love you people with a love that will last forever . That is why I have continued showing you kindness .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	4	People of Israel , I will build you up again , and you will be rebuilt . You will pick up your tambourines again and dance with those who are joyful .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	5	You will plant vineyards again on the hills around Samaria . The farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	6	There will be a time when watchmen in the mountains of Ephraim shout this message : ‘ Come , let ’ s go up to Jerusalem to worship the Lord our God ! ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	31	7	This is what the Lord says : “ Be happy and sing for the people of Jacob . Shout for Israel , the greatest of the nations . Sing your praises and shout this : ‘ Lord , save your people , those who are left alive from the nation of Israel ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	31	8	Look , I will soon bring Israel from the country in the north , and I will gather them from the faraway places on earth . Some of the people are blind and crippled . Some of the women are pregnant , and some are ready to give birth . A great many people will come back .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	9	They will be crying as they come , but they will pray as I bring them back . I will lead those people by streams of water on an even road where they will not stumble . I am Israel ’ s father , and Israel is my firstborn son .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	10	“ Nations , listen to the message from the Lord . Tell this message in the faraway lands by the sea : ‘ The one who scattered the people of Israel will bring them back , and he will watch over his people like a shepherd. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	31	11	The Lord will pay for the people of Jacob and will buy them back from people stronger than they were .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	12	The people of Israel will come to the high points of Jerusalem and shout for joy . Their faces will shine with happiness about all the good things from the Lord : the grain , new wine , oil , young sheep , and young cows . They will be like a garden that has plenty of water , and they will not be troubled anymore .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	13	Then young women of Israel will be happy and dance , the young men and old men also . I will change their sadness into happiness ; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sadness .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	14	The priests will have more than enough sacrifices , and my people will be filled with the good things I give them ! ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	15	This is what the Lord says : “ A voice was heard in Ramah of painful crying and deep sadness : Rachel crying for her children . She refused to be comforted , because her children are dead ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	31	16	But this is what the Lord says : “ Stop crying ; don ’ t let your eyes fill with tears . You will be rewarded for your work ! ” says the Lord . “ The people will return from their enemy ’ s land .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	17	So there is hope for you in the future , ” says the Lord . “ Your children will return to their own land .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	18	“ I have heard Israel moaning : ‘ Lord , you punished me , and I have learned my lesson . I was like a calf that had never been trained . Take me back so that I may come back . You truly are the Lord my God .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	19	Lord , after I wandered away from you , I changed my heart and life . After I understood , I beat my breast with sorrow . I was ashamed and disgraced , because I suffered for the foolish things I did when I was young. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	31	20	“ You know that Israel is my dear son , The child I love . Yes , I often speak against Israel , but I still remember him . I love him very much , and I want to comfort him , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	21	“ People of Israel , fix the road signs . Put up signs to show you the way home . Watch the road . Pay attention to the road on which you travel . People of Israel , come home , come back to your towns .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	22	You are an unfaithful daughter . How long will you wander before you come home ? The Lord has made something new happen in the land : A woman will go seeking a man. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	31	23	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ I will again do good things for the people of Judah . At that time the people in the land of Judah and its towns will again use these words : ‘ May the Lord bless you , home of what is good , holy mountain. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	31	24	People in all the towns of Judah will live together in peace . Farmers and those who move around with their flocks will live together in peace .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	25	I will give rest and strength to those who are weak and tired. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	31	26	After hearing that , I , Jeremiah , woke up and looked around . My sleep had been very pleasant .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	27	The Lord says , “ The time is coming when I will help the families of Israel and Judah and their children and animals to grow .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	28	In the past I watched over Israel and Judah , to pull them up and tear them down , to destroy them and bring them disaster . But now I will watch over them to build them up and make them strong , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	29	“ At that time people will no longer say : ‘ The parents have eaten sour grapes , and that caused the children to grind their teeth from the sour taste. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	31	30	Instead , each person will die for his own sin ; the person who eats sour grapes will grind his own teeth . The New Agreement
NCV	Jeremiah	31	32	It will not be like the agreement I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to bring them out of Egypt . I was a husband to them , but they broke that agreement , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	33	“ This is the agreement I will make with the people of Israel at that time , ” says the Lord : “ I will put my teachings in their minds and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	34	People will no longer have to teach their neighbors and relatives to know the Lord , because all people will know me , from the least to the most important , ” says the Lord . “ I will forgive them for the wicked things they did , and I will not remember their sins anymore. ” The Lord Will Never Leave Israel
NCV	Jeremiah	31	35	The Lord makes the sun shine in the day and the moon and stars to shine at night . He stirs up the sea so that its waves crash on the shore . The Lord All-Powerful is his name . This is what the Lord says :
NCV	Jeremiah	31	36	“ Only if these laws should ever fail , ” says the Lord , “ will Israel ’ s descendants ever stop being a nation before me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	31	37	This is what the Lord says : “ Only if people can measure the sky above and learn the secrets of the earth below , will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of what they have done , ” says the Lord . The New Jerusalem
NCV	Jeremiah	31	38	The Lord says , “ The time is coming when Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me—everything from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	39	The measuring line will stretch from the Corner Gate straight to the hill of Gareb . Then it will turn to the place named Goah .
NCV	Jeremiah	31	40	The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown , and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate—all that area will be holy to the Lord . The city of Jerusalem will never again be torn down or destroyed. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	32	32	I will destroy it , because of all the evil the people of Israel and Judah have done . The people , their kings and officers , their priests and prophets , all the people of Judah , and the people of Jerusalem have made me angry .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	2	At that time the army of the king of Babylon was surrounding Jerusalem . Jeremiah the prophet was under arrest in the courtyard of the guard , which was at the palace of the king of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	3	Zedekiah king of Judah had put Jeremiah in prison there . Zedekiah had asked , “ Why have you prophesied the things you have ? ” ( Jeremiah had said , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ I will soon hand the city of Jerusalem over to the king of Babylon , and he will capture it .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	4	Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the Babylonian army , but he will surely be handed over to the king of Babylon . And he will speak to the king of Babylon face to face and see him with his own eyes .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	5	The king will take Zedekiah to Babylon , where he will stay until I have punished him , ’ says the Lord . ‘ If you fight against the Babylonians , you will not succeed. ’ ” )
NCV	Jeremiah	32	6	While Jeremiah was in prison , he said , “ The Lord spoke this word to me :
NCV	Jeremiah	32	7	Your cousin Hanamel , son of your uncle Shallum , will come to you soon . Hanamel will say to you , ‘ Jeremiah , you are my nearest relative , so buy my field near the town of Anathoth . It is your right and your duty to buy that field. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	32	8	“ Then it happened just as the Lord had said . My cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said to me , ‘ Buy for yourself my field near Anathoth in the land of Benjamin . It is your right and duty to buy it and own it. ’ So I knew this was a message from the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	9	“ I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel , weighing out seven ounces of silver for him .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed the record and sealed it and had some people witness it . I also weighed out the silver on the scales .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	11	Then I took both copies of the record of ownership—the one that was sealed that had the demands and limits of ownership , and the one that was not sealed .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	12	And I gave them to Baruch son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah . My cousin Hanamel , the other witnesses who signed the record of ownership , and many Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard saw me give the record of ownership to Baruch .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	13	“ With all the people watching , I told Baruch ,
NCV	Jeremiah	32	14	‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Take both copies of the record of ownership—the sealed copy and the copy that was not sealed—and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	15	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : In the future my people will once again buy houses and fields for grain and vineyards in the land of Israel. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	32	16	“ After I gave the record of ownership to Baruch son of Neriah , I prayed to the Lord ,
NCV	Jeremiah	32	17	Oh , Lord God , you made the skies and the earth with your very great power . There is nothing too hard for you to do .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	18	You show love and kindness to thousands of people , but you also bring punishment to children for their parents ’ sins . Great and powerful God , your name is the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	19	You plan and do great things . You see everything that people do , and you reward people for the way they live and for what they do .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	20	You did miracles and wonderful things in the land of Egypt . You have continued doing them in Israel and among the other nations even until today . So you have become well known .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	21	You brought your people , the Israelites , out of Egypt using signs and miracles and your great power and strength . You brought great terror on everyone .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	22	You gave them this land that you promised to their ancestors long ago , a fertile land .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	23	They came into this land and took it for their own , but they did not obey you or follow your teachings . They did not do everything you commanded . So you made all these terrible things happen to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	24	“ Look ! The enemy has surrounded the city and has built roads to the top of the walls to capture it . Because of war , hunger , and terrible diseases , the city will be handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it . You said this would happen , and now you see it is happening .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	25	But now , Lord God , you tell me , ‘ Buy the field with silver and call in witnesses. ’ You tell me this while the Babylonian army is ready to capture the city. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	32	26	Then the Lord spoke this word to Jeremiah :
NCV	Jeremiah	32	27	“ I am the Lord , the God of every person on the earth . Nothing is impossible for me .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	28	So this is what the Lord says : I will soon hand over the city of Jerusalem to the Babylonian army and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , who will capture it .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	29	The Babylonian army is already attacking the city of Jerusalem . They will soon enter it and start a fire to burn down the city and its houses . The people of Jerusalem offered sacrifices to Baal on the roofs [ a ] of those same houses and poured out drink offerings to other idols to make me angry .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	30	From their youth , the people of Israel and Judah have done only the things I said were wrong . They have made me angry by worshiping idols made with their own hands , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	31	“ From the day Jerusalem was built until now , this city has made me angry , so angry that I must remove it from my sight .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	33	They turned their backs to me , not their faces . I tried to teach them again and again , but they wouldn ’ t listen or learn .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	34	They put their hateful idols in the place where I have chosen to be worshiped , so they made it unclean .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	35	In the Valley of Ben Hinnom they built places to worship Baal so they could burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to Molech . But I never commanded them to do such a hateful thing . It never entered my mind that they would do such a thing and cause Judah to sin .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	36	“ You are saying , ‘ Because of war , hunger , and terrible diseases , the city will be handed over to the king of Babylon. ’ But the Lord , the God of Israel , says about Jerusalem :
NCV	Jeremiah	32	37	I forced the people of Israel and Judah to leave their land , because I was furious and very angry with them . But soon I will gather them from all the lands where I forced them to go , and I will bring them back to this place , where they may live in safety .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	38	The people of Israel and Judah will be my people , and I will be their God .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	39	I will make them truly want to be one people with one goal . They will truly want to worship me all their lives , for their own good and for the good of their children after them .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	40	“ I will make an agreement with them that will last forever . I will never turn away from them ; I will always do good to them . I will make them want to respect me so they will never turn away from me .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	41	I will enjoy doing good to them . And with my whole being I will surely plant them in this land and make them grow. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	32	42	This is what the Lord says : “ I have brought this great disaster to the people of Israel and Judah . In the same way I will bring the good things that I promise to do for them .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	43	You are saying , ‘ This land is an empty desert , without people or animals . It has been handed over to the Babylonians. ’ But in the future , people will again buy fields in this land .
NCV	Jeremiah	32	44	They will use their money to buy fields . They will sign and seal their agreements and call in witnesses . They will again buy fields in the land of Benjamin , in the area around Jerusalem , in the towns of Judah and in the mountains , in the western hills , and in southern Judah . I will make everything as good for them as it once was , ” says the Lord . Footnotes - 32:29 roofs In Bible times houses were built with flat roofs .

NCV	Jeremiah	33	33	While Jeremiah was still locked up in the courtyard of the guards , the Lord spoke his word to him a second time :
NCV	Jeremiah	33	2	“ These are the words of the Lord , who made the earth , shaped it , and gave it order , whose name is the Lord :
NCV	Jeremiah	33	3	‘ Judah , pray to me , and I will answer you . I will tell you important secrets you have never heard before. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	33	4	This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says about the houses in Jerusalem and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used in defense of the attack by the Babylonian army :
NCV	Jeremiah	33	5	‘ Some people will come to fight against the Babylonians . They will fill these houses with the bodies of people I killed in my hot anger . I have turned away from this city because of all the evil its people have done .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	6	“ ‘ But then I will bring health and healing to the people there . I will heal them and let them enjoy great peace and safety .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	7	I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and make them strong countries as in the past .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	8	They sinned against me , but I will wash away that sin . They did evil and turned away from me , but I will forgive them .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	9	Then “ Jerusalem ” will be to me a name that brings joy ! And people from all nations of the earth will praise it when they hear about the good things I am doing there . They will be surprised and shocked at all the good things and the peace I will bring to Jerusalem. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	33	10	“ You are saying , ‘ Our country is an empty desert , without people or animals. ’ But this is what the Lord says : It is now quiet in the streets of Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah , without people or animals , but it will be noisy there soon !
NCV	Jeremiah	33	11	There will be sounds of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of brides and bridegrooms . There will be the sounds of people bringing to the Temple of the Lord their offerings of thanks to the Lord . They will say , ‘ Praise the Lord All-Powerful , because the Lord is good ! His love continues forever ! ’ They will say this because I will again do good things for Judah , as I did in the beginning , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	12	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ This place is empty now , without people or animals . But there will be shepherds in all the towns of Judah and pastures where they let their flocks rest .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	13	Shepherds will again count their sheep as the sheep walk in front of them . They will count them in the mountains and in the western hills , in southern Judah and the land of Benjamin , and around Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah ! ” says the Lord . The Good Branch
NCV	Jeremiah	33	14	The Lord says , “ The time is coming when I will do the good thing I promised to the people of Israel and Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	15	In those days and at that time , I will make a good branch sprout from David ’ s family . He will do what is fair and right in the land .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	16	At that time Judah will be saved , and the people of Jerusalem will live in safety . The branch will be named : The Lord Does What Is Right. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	33	17	This is what the Lord says : “ Someone from David ’ s family will always sit on the throne of the family of Israel .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	18	And there will always be priests from the family of Levi . They will always stand before me to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings and sacrifices to me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	33	19	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah , saying :
NCV	Jeremiah	33	20	“ This is what the Lord says : I have an agreement with day and night that they will always come at the right times . If you could change that agreement ,
NCV	Jeremiah	33	21	only then could you change my agreement with David and Levi . Only then would my servant David not have a descendant ruling as king on David ’ s throne . And only then would the family of Levi not be priests serving me in the Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	33	22	But I will give many descendants to my servant David and to the family group of Levi who serve me in the Temple . They will be as many as the stars in the sky that no one can count . They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore that no one can measure. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	33	23	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah , saying :
NCV	Jeremiah	33	24	“ Jeremiah , have you heard what the people are saying ? They say : ‘ The Lord turned away from the two families of Israel and Judah that he chose. ’ Now they don ’ t think of my people as a nation anymore ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	33	25	This is what the Lord says : “ If I had not made my agreement with day and night , and if I had not made the laws for the sky and earth ,
NCV	Jeremiah	33	26	only then would I turn away from Jacob ’ s descendants . And only then would I not let the descendants of David my servant rule over the descendants of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . But I will be kind to them and cause good things to happen to them again. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	34	34	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and all the towns around it . Nebuchadnezzar had with him all his army and the armies of all the kingdoms and peoples he ruled .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	2	This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , said : “ Jeremiah , go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him : ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will soon hand the city of Jerusalem over to the king of Babylon , and he will burn it down !
NCV	Jeremiah	34	3	You will not escape from the king of Babylon ; you will surely be captured and handed over to him . You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes , and he will talk to you face to face . And you will go to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	4	But , Zedekiah king of Judah , listen to the promise of the Lord . This is what the Lord says about you : You will not be killed with a sword .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	5	You will die in a peaceful way . As people made funeral fires to honor your ancestors , the kings who ruled before you , so people will make a funeral fire to honor you . They will cry for you and sadly say , “ Ah , master ! ” I myself make this promise to you , says the Lord. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	34	6	So Jeremiah the prophet gave this message to Zedekiah in Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	7	This was while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah that had not yet been taken—Lachish and Azekah . These were the only strong , walled cities left in the land of Judah . Slaves Are Mistreated
NCV	Jeremiah	34	8	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah . This was after King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem to free all the Hebrew slaves .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	9	Everyone was supposed to free his Hebrew slaves , both male and female . No one was to keep a fellow Jew as a slave .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	10	All the officers and all the people accepted this agreement ; they agreed to free their male and female slaves and no longer keep them as slaves . So all the slaves were set free .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	11	But after that , the people who had slaves changed their minds . So they took back the people they had set free and made them slaves again .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	12	Then the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah :
NCV	Jeremiah	34	13	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : I brought your ancestors out of Egypt where they were slaves and made an agreement with them .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	14	I said to your ancestors : ‘ At the end of every seven years , each one of you must set his Hebrew slaves free . If a fellow Hebrew has sold himself to you , you must let him go free after he has served you for six years. ’ But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	15	A short time ago you changed your hearts and did what I say is right . Each of you gave freedom to his fellow Hebrews who were slaves . And you even made an agreement before me in the place where I have chosen to be worshiped .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	16	But now you have changed your minds . You have shown you do not honor me . Each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free , and you have forced them to become your slaves again .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	17	“ So this is what the Lord says : You have not obeyed me . You have not given freedom to your fellow Hebrews , neither relatives nor friends . But now I will give freedom , says the Lord , to war , to terrible diseases , and to hunger . I will make you hated by all the kingdoms of the earth .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	18	I will hand over the men who broke my agreement , who have not kept the promises they made before me . They cut a calf into two pieces before me and walked between the pieces . [ a ]
NCV	Jeremiah	34	19	These people made the agreement before me by walking between the pieces of the calf : the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the officers of the court , the priests , and all the people of the land .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	20	So I will hand them over to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them . Their bodies will become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	21	I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officers over to their enemies , and to everyone who wants to kill them , and to the army of the king of Babylon , even though they have left Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	34	22	I will give the order , says the Lord , to bring the Babylonian army back to Jerusalem . It will fight against Jerusalem , capture it , set it on fire , and burn it down . I will destroy the towns in Judah so that they become ruins where no one lives ! ” Footnotes - 34:18 They . . . pieces .

NCV	Jeremiah	35	35	When Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah , the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah , saying :
NCV	Jeremiah	35	2	“ Go to the family of Recab . Invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the Temple of the Lord , and offer them wine to drink. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	35	3	So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah , [ a ] the son of Habazziniah . And I gathered all of Jaazaniah ’ s brothers and sons and the whole family of the Recabites together .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	4	Then I brought them into the Temple of the Lord . We went into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah , who was a man of God . The room was next to the one where the officers stay and above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum , the doorkeeper in the Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I put some bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the Recabite family . And I said to them , “ Drink some wine. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	35	6	But the Recabite men answered , “ We never drink wine . Our ancestor Jonadab son of Recab gave us this command : ‘ You and your descendants must never drink wine .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	7	Also you must never build houses , plant seeds , or plant vineyards , or do any of those things . You must live only in tents . Then you will live a long time in the land where you are wanderers. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	35	8	So we Recabites have obeyed everything Jonadab our ancestor commanded us . Neither we nor our wives , sons , or daughters ever drink wine .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	9	We never build houses in which to live , or own fields or vineyards , or plant crops .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	10	We have lived in tents and have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	11	But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Judah , we said to each other , ‘ Come , we must enter Jerusalem so we can escape the Babylonian army and the Aramean army. ’ So we have stayed in Jerusalem. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	35	12	Then the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah :
NCV	Jeremiah	35	13	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Jeremiah , go and tell the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem : ‘ You should learn a lesson and obey my message , ’ says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	14	‘ Jonadab son of Recab ordered his descendants not to drink wine , and that command has been obeyed . Until today they have obeyed their ancestor ’ s command ; they do not drink wine . But I , the Lord , have given you messages again and again , but you did not obey me .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	15	I sent all my servants the prophets to you again and again , saying , “ Each of you must stop doing evil . You must change and be good . Do not follow other gods to serve them . If you obey me , you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors. ” But you have not listened to me or paid attention to my message .
NCV	Jeremiah	35	16	The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab obeyed the commands their ancestor gave them , but the people of Judah have not obeyed me. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	35	17	“ So the Lord God All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I will soon bring every disaster I said would come to Judah and to everyone living in Jerusalem . I spoke to those people , but they refused to listen . I called out to them , but they did not answer me. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	35	18	Then Jeremiah said to the Recabites , “ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You have obeyed the commands of your ancestor Jonadab and have followed all of his teachings ; you have done everything he commanded. ’

NCV	Jeremiah	36	36	The Lord spoke this word to Jeremiah during the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah :
NCV	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Get a scroll . Write on it all the words I have spoken to you about Israel and Judah and all the nations . Write everything from when I first spoke to you , when Josiah was king , until now .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	3	Maybe the family of Judah will hear what disasters I am planning to bring on them and will stop doing wicked things . Then I would forgive them for the sins and the evil things they have done. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	4	So Jeremiah called for Baruch son of Neriah . Jeremiah spoke the messages the Lord had given him , and Baruch wrote those messages on the scroll .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	5	Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch , “ I can not go to the Temple of the Lord . I must stay here .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	6	So I want you to go to the Temple of the Lord on a day when the people are fasting . Read from the scroll to all the people of Judah who come into Jerusalem from their towns . Read the messages from the Lord , which are the words you wrote on the scroll as I spoke them to you .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	7	Perhaps they will ask the Lord to help them . Perhaps each one will stop doing wicked things , because the Lord has announced that he is very angry with them. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	8	So Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do . In the Lord ’ s Temple he read aloud the scroll that had the Lord ’ s messages written on it .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	9	In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king , a fast was announced . All the people of Jerusalem and everyone who had come into Jerusalem from the towns of Judah were supposed to give up eating to honor the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	10	At that time Baruch read to all the people there the scroll containing Jeremiah ’ s words . He read the scroll in the Temple of the Lord in the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan , a royal secretary . That room was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	11	Micaiah son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan , heard all the messages from the Lord that were on the scroll .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	12	Micaiah went down to the royal secretary ’ s room in the king ’ s palace where all of the officers were sitting : Elishama the royal secretary ; Delaiah son of Shemaiah ; Elnathan son of Acbor ; Gemariah son of Shaphan ; Zedekiah son of Hananiah ; and all the other officers .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	13	Micaiah told those officers everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	14	Then the officers sent a man named Jehudi son of Nethaniah to Baruch . ( Nethaniah was the son of Shelemiah , who was the son of Cushi . ) Jehudi said to Baruch , “ Bring the scroll that you read to the people and come with me. ” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went with Jehudi to the officers .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	15	Then the officers said to Baruch , “ Please sit down and read the scroll to us. ” So Baruch read the scroll to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	16	When the officers heard all the words , they became afraid and looked at each other . They said to Baruch , “ We must certainly tell the king about these words. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	17	Then the officers asked Baruch , “ Tell us , please , where did you get all these words you wrote on the scroll ? Did you write down what Jeremiah said to you ? ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	18	“ Yes , ” Baruch answered . “ Jeremiah spoke them all to me , and I wrote them down with ink on this scroll. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	19	Then the officers said to Baruch , “ You and Jeremiah must go and hide , and don ’ t tell anyone where you are. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	20	The officers put the scroll in the room of Elishama the royal secretary . Then they went to the king in the courtyard and told him all about the scroll .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	21	So King Jehoiakim sent Jehudi to get the scroll . Jehudi brought the scroll from the room of Elishama the royal secretary and read it to the king and to all the officers who stood around the king .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	22	It was the ninth month of the year , so King Jehoiakim was sitting in the winter apartment . There was a fire burning in a small firepot in front of him .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	23	After Jehudi had read three or four columns , the king cut those columns off of the scroll with a penknife and threw them into the firepot . Finally , the whole scroll was burned in the fire .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	24	King Jehoiakim and his servants heard everything that was said , but they were not frightened ! They did not tear their clothes to show their sorrow .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	25	Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah even tried to talk King Jehoiakim out of burning the scroll , but he would not listen to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	26	Instead , the king ordered Jerahmeel son of the king , Seraiah son of Azriel , and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet . But the Lord had hidden them .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	27	So King Jehoiakim burned the scroll where Baruch had written all the words Jeremiah had spoken to him . Then the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah :
NCV	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Get another scroll . Write all the words on it that were on the first scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	29	Also say this to Jehoiakim king of Judah : ‘ This is what the Lord says : You burned up that scroll and said , “ Why , Jeremiah , did you write on it ‘ the king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land and the people and animals in it ’ ? ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	30	So this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah : Jehoiakim ’ s descendants will not sit on David ’ s throne . When Jehoiakim dies , his body will be thrown out on the ground . It will be left out in the heat of the day and in the cold frost of the night .
NCV	Jeremiah	36	31	I will punish Jehoiakim and his children and his servants , because they have done evil things . I will bring disasters upon them and upon all the people in Jerusalem and Judah—everything I promised but which they refused to hear. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	36	32	So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah , his secretary . As Jeremiah spoke , Baruch wrote on the scroll the same words that were on the scroll Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire . And many similar words were added to the second scroll .

NCV	Jeremiah	37	37	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had appointed Zedekiah son of Josiah to be king of Judah . Zedekiah took the place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	2	But Zedekiah , his servants , and the people of Judah did not listen to the words the Lord had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	3	Now King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah with a message to Jeremiah the prophet . This was the message : “ Jeremiah , please pray to the Lord our God for us. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	37	4	At that time Jeremiah had not yet been put into prison . So he was free to go anywhere he wanted .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	5	The army of the king of Egypt had marched from Egypt toward Judah . Now the Babylonian army had surrounded the city of Jerusalem . When they heard about the Egyptian army marching toward them , the Babylonian army left Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	6	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah the prophet :
NCV	Jeremiah	37	7	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Jehucal and Zephaniah , I know Zedekiah king of Judah sent you to seek my help . Tell this to King Zedekiah : ‘ The army of the king of Egypt came here to help you , but they will go back to Egypt .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	8	After that , the Babylonian army will return and attack Jerusalem and capture it and burn it down. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	37	9	“ This is what the Lord says : People of Jerusalem , do not fool yourselves . Don ’ t say , ‘ The Babylonian army will surely leave us alone. ’ They will not !
NCV	Jeremiah	37	10	Even if you defeated all of the Babylonian army that is attacking you and there were only a few injured men left in their tents , they would come from their tents and burn down Jerusalem ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	37	11	So the Babylonian army left Jerusalem to fight the army of the king of Egypt .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	12	Now Jeremiah tried to travel from Jerusalem to the land of Benjamin to get his share of the property that belonged to his family .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	13	When Jeremiah got to the Benjamin Gate of Jerusalem , the captain in charge of the guards arrested him . The captain ’ s name was Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah . Irijah said , “ You are leaving us to join the Babylonians ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	37	14	But Jeremiah said to Irijah , “ That ’ s not true ! I am not leaving to join the Babylonians. ” Irijah refused to listen to Jeremiah , so he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officers of Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	15	Those rulers were very angry with Jeremiah and beat him . Then they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the royal secretary , which had been made into a prison .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	16	So those people put Jeremiah into a cell in a dungeon , and Jeremiah was there for a long time .
NCV	Jeremiah	37	17	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the palace . Zedekiah asked him in private , “ Is there any message from the Lord ? ” Jeremiah answered , “ Yes , there is . Zedekiah , you will be handed over to the king of Babylon. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	37	18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah , “ What crime have I done against you or your officers or the people of Jerusalem ? Why have you thrown me into prison ?
NCV	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are your prophets that prophesied this message to you : ‘ The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land of Judah ’ ?
NCV	Jeremiah	37	20	But now , my master , king of Judah , please listen to me , and please do what I ask of you . Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the royal secretary , or I will die there ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	37	21	So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah to be put under guard in the courtyard of the guard and to be given bread each day from the street of the bakers until there was no more bread in the city . So he stayed under guard in the courtyard of the guard . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	38	38	Shephatiah son of Mattan , Gedaliah son of Pashhur , Jehucal son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people . He said :
NCV	Jeremiah	38	2	“ This is what the Lord says : ‘ Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war , or hunger , or terrible diseases . But everyone who surrenders to the Babylonian army will live ; they will escape with their lives and live. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	38	3	And this is what the Lord says : ‘ This city of Jerusalem will surely be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon . He will capture this city ! ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	4	Then the officers said to the king , “ Jeremiah must be put to death ! He is discouraging the soldiers who are still in the city , and all the people , by what he is saying to them . He does not want good to happen to us ; he wants to ruin us. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	5	King Zedekiah said to them , “ Jeremiah is in your control . I can not do anything to stop you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	6	So the officers took Jeremiah and put him into the well of Malkijah , the king ’ s son , which was in the courtyard of the guards . The officers used ropes to lower Jeremiah into the well , which did not have any water in it , only mud . And Jeremiah sank down into the mud .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	7	But Ebed-Melech , a Cushite and a servant in the palace , heard that the officers had put Jeremiah into the well . As King Zedekiah was sitting at the Benjamin Gate ,
NCV	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebed-Melech left the palace and went to the king . Ebed-Melech said to him ,
NCV	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My master and king , these rulers have acted in an evil way . They have treated Jeremiah the prophet badly . They have thrown him into a well and left him there to die ! When there is no more bread in the city , he will starve to death. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	10	Then King Zedekiah commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite , “ Take thirty men from the palace and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the well before he dies. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the storeroom in the palace . He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from that room . Then he let those rags down with some ropes to Jeremiah in the well .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	12	Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah , “ Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to be pads for the ropes. ” So Jeremiah did as Ebed-Melech said .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	13	The men pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the well . And Jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard of the guard . Zedekiah Questions Jeremiah
NCV	Jeremiah	38	14	Then King Zedekiah sent someone to get Jeremiah the prophet and bring him to the third entrance to the Temple of the Lord . The king said to Jeremiah , “ I am going to ask you something . Do not hide anything from me , but tell me everything honestly. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ If I give you an answer , you will surely kill me . And even if I give you advice , you will not listen to me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	16	But King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah , “ As surely as the Lord lives who has given us breath and life , I will not kill you . And I promise not to hand you over to the officers who want to kill you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ This is what the Lord God All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon , your life will be saved . Jerusalem will not be burned down , and you and your family will live .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	18	But if you refuse to surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon , Jerusalem will be handed over to the Babylonian army , and they will burn it down . And you yourself will not escape from them. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	19	Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ I ’ m afraid of some Jews who have already gone over to the side of the Babylonian army . If the Babylonians hand me over to them , they will treat me badly. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	20	But Jeremiah answered , “ The Babylonians will not hand you over to the Jews . Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you . Then things will go well for you , and your life will be saved .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender to the Babylonians , the Lord has shown me what will happen .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	22	All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out and taken to the important officers of the king of Babylon . Your women will make fun of you with this song : ‘ Your good friends misled you and were stronger than you . While your feet were stuck in the mud , they left you. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	38	23	“ All your wives and children will be brought out and given to the Babylonian army . You yourself will not even escape from them . You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylon , and Jerusalem will be burned down. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ Do not tell anyone that I have been talking to you , or you will die .
NCV	Jeremiah	38	25	If the officers find out I talked to you , they will come to you and say , ‘ Tell us what you said to King Zedekiah and what he said to you . Don ’ t keep any secrets from us . If you don ’ t tell us everything , we will kill you. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	38	26	If they ask you , tell them , ‘ I was begging the king not to send me back to Jonathan ’ s house to die. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	38	27	All the officers did come to question Jeremiah . So he told them everything the king had ordered him to say . Then the officers said no more to Jeremiah , because no one had heard what Jeremiah and the king had discussed .

NCV	Jeremiah	39	39	This is how Jerusalem was captured : Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and surrounded the city to attack it . This was during the tenth month of the ninth year Zedekiah was king of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	2	This lasted until the ninth day of the fourth month in Zedekiah ’ s eleventh year . Then the city wall was broken through .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	3	And all these officers of the king of Babylon came into Jerusalem and sat down at the Middle Gate : Nergal-Sharezer of the district of Samgar ; Nebo-Sarsekim , a chief officer ; Nergal-Sharezer , an important leader ; and all the other important officers .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	4	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all his soldiers saw them , they ran away . They left Jerusalem at night and went out from the king ’ s garden . They went through the gate that was between the two walls and then headed toward the Jordan Valley .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	5	But the Babylonian army chased them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho . They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , who was at the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath . There Nebuchadnezzar passed his sentence on Zedekiah .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	6	At Riblah the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah ’ s sons and all the important officers of Judah as Zedekiah watched .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	7	Then he put out Zedekiah ’ s eyes . He put bronze chains on Zedekiah and took him to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	8	The Babylonians set fire to the palace and to the houses of the people , and they broke down the walls around Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	9	Nebuzaradan , commander of the king ’ s special guards , took the people left in Jerusalem , those captives who had surrendered to him earlier , and the rest of the people of Jerusalem , and he took them all away to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzaradan , commander of the guard , left some of the poorest people of Judah behind . They owned nothing , but that day he gave them vineyards and fields .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	11	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan , commander of the guard :
NCV	Jeremiah	39	12	“ Find Jeremiah and take care of him . Do not hurt him , but do for him whatever he asks you. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuchadnezzar sent these men for Jeremiah : Nebuzaradan , commander of the guards ; Nebushazban , a chief officer ; Nergal-Sharezer , an important leader ; and all the other officers of the king of Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	14	They had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard . Then they turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan , who had orders to take Jeremiah back home . So they took him home , and he stayed among the people left in Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	15	While Jeremiah was guarded in the courtyard , the Lord spoke his word to him :
NCV	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Jeremiah , go and tell Ebed-Melech the Cushite this message : ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Very soon I will make my words about Jerusalem come true through disaster , not through good times . You will see everything come true with your own eyes .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	17	But I will save you on that day , Ebed-Melech , says the Lord . You will not be handed over to the people you fear .
NCV	Jeremiah	39	18	I will surely save you , Ebed-Melech . You will not die from a sword , but you will escape and live . This will happen because you have trusted in me , says the Lord. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	40	40	The Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan , commander of the guards , had set Jeremiah free at the city of Ramah . He had found Jeremiah in Ramah bound in chains with all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken away to Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	2	When commander Nebuzaradan found Jeremiah , Nebuzaradan said to him , “ The Lord your God announced this disaster would come to this place .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	3	And now the Lord has done everything he said he would do . This disaster happened because the people of Judah sinned against the Lord and did not obey him .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	4	But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists . If you want to , come with me to Babylon , and I will take good care of you . But if you don ’ t want to come , then don ’ t . Look , the whole country is open to you . Go wherever you wish. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	40	5	Before Jeremiah turned to leave , Nebuzaradan said , “ Or go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan . The king of Babylon has chosen him to be governor over the towns of Judah . Go and live with Gedaliah among the people , or go anywhere you want. ” Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him there . He lived among the people who were left behind in Judah . The Short Rule of Gedaliah
NCV	Jeremiah	40	7	Some officers and their men from the army of Judah were still out in the open country . They heard that the king of Babylon had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam in charge of the people who were left in the land : the men , women , and children who were the poorest . They were the ones who were not taken to Babylon as captives .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	8	So these soldiers came to Gedaliah at Mizpah : Ishmael son of Nethaniah , Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah , Seraiah son of Tanhumeth , the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite , and their men .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	9	Gedaliah son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , made a promise to them , saying , “ Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians . Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon . Then everything will go well for you .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	10	I myself will live in Mizpah and will speak for you before the Babylonians who come to us here . Harvest the wine , the summer fruit , and the oil , and put what you harvest in your storage jars . Live in the towns you control. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	40	11	The Jews in Moab , Ammon , Edom , and other countries also heard that the king of Babylon had left a few Jews alive in the land . And they heard the king of Babylon had chosen Gedaliah as governor over them . ( Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan . )
NCV	Jeremiah	40	12	When the people of Judah heard this news , they came back to Judah from all the countries where they had been scattered . They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and gathered a large harvest of wine and summer fruit .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	13	Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers of Judah still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	14	They said to him , “ Don ’ t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonite people wants you dead ? He has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you. ” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them .
NCV	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah . He said , “ Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah . No one will know anything about it . We should not let Ishmael kill you . Then all the Jews gathered around you would be scattered to different countries again , and the few people of Judah who are left alive would be lost. ”

NCV	Jeremiah	41	41	In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah and ten of his men came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah . ( Nethaniah was the son of Elishama . ) Now Ishmael was a member of the king ’ s family and had been one of the officers of the king of Judah . While they were eating a meal with Gedaliah at Mizpah ,
NCV	Jeremiah	41	2	Ishmael and his ten men got up and killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , with a sword . ( Gedaliah was the man the king of Babylon had chosen as governor over Judah . )
NCV	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also killed all the Jews and the Babylonian soldiers who were there with Gedaliah at Mizpah .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	4	The day after Gedaliah was murdered , before anyone knew about it ,
NCV	Jeremiah	41	5	eighty men came to Mizpah bringing grain offerings and incense to the Temple of the Lord . Those men from Shechem , Shiloh , and Samaria had shaved off their beards , torn their clothes , and cut themselves . [ a ]
NCV	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them , crying as he walked . When he met them , he said , “ Come with me to meet Gedaliah son of Ahikam. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	41	7	So they went into Mizpah . Then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and his men killed seventy of them and threw the bodies into a deep well .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	8	But the ten men who were left alive said to Ishmael , “ Don ’ t kill us ! We have wheat and barley and oil and honey that we have hidden in a field. ” So Ishmael let them live and did not kill them with the others .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	9	Now the well where he had thrown all the bodies had been made by King Asa as a part of his defenses against Baasha king of Israel . But Ishmael son of Nethaniah put dead bodies in it until it was full .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	10	Ishmael captured all the other people in Mizpah : the king ’ s daughters and all the other people who were left there . They were the ones whom Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had chosen Gedaliah son of Ahikam to take care of . So Ishmael son of Nethaniah captured those people , and he started to cross over to the country of the Ammonites .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	11	Johanan son of Kareah and all his army officers with him heard about all the evil things Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	12	So they took their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah and caught him near the big pool of water at Gibeon .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	13	When the captives Ishmael had taken saw Johanan and the army officers , they were glad .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	14	So all the people Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and ran to Johanan son of Kareah .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and ran away to the Ammonites .
NCV	Jeremiah	41	16	So Johanan son of Kareah and all his army officers saved the captives that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had taken from Mizpah after he murdered Gedaliah son of Ahikam . Among those left alive were soldiers , women , children , and palace officers . And Johanan brought them back from the town of Gibeon . The Escape to Egypt 17-18 Johanan and the other army officers were afraid of the Babylonians . Since the king of Babylon had chosen Gedaliah son of Ahikam to be governor of Judah but Ishmael son of Nethaniah had murdered him , Johanan was afraid that the Babylonians would be angry . So they decided to run away to Egypt . On the way they stayed at Geruth Kimham , near the town of Bethlehem .

NCV	Jeremiah	42	2	They said to him , “ Jeremiah , please listen to what we ask . Pray to the Lord your God for all the people left alive from the family of Judah . At one time there were many of us , but you can see that there are few of us now .

NCV	Jeremiah	42	8	Then Jeremiah called for Johanan son of Kareah , the army officers with him , and all the other people , from the least important to the greatest .
NCV	Jeremiah	42	9	Jeremiah said to them , “ You sent me to ask the Lord for what you wanted . This is what the God of Israel says :
NCV	Jeremiah	42	10	‘ If you will stay in Judah , I will build you up and not tear you down . I will plant you and not pull you up , because I am sad about the disaster I brought on you .
NCV	Jeremiah	42	11	Now you fear the king of Babylon , but don ’ t be afraid of him . Don ’ t be afraid of him , ’ says the Lord , ‘ because I am with you . I will save you and rescue you from his power .
NCV	Jeremiah	42	12	I will be kind to you , and he will also treat you with mercy and let you stay in your land. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	42	13	“ But if you say , ‘ We will not stay in Judah , ’ you will disobey the Lord your God .
NCV	Jeremiah	42	14	Or you might say , ‘ No , we will go and live in Egypt . There we will not see war , or hear the trumpets of war , or be hungry. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	42	15	If you say that , listen to the message of the Lord , you who are left alive from Judah . This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ If you make up your mind to go and live in Egypt , these things will happen :
NCV	Jeremiah	42	16	You are afraid of war , but it will find you in the land of Egypt . And you are worried about hunger , but it will follow you into Egypt , and you will die there .
NCV	Jeremiah	42	17	Everyone who goes to live in Egypt will die in war or from hunger or terrible disease . No one who goes to Egypt will live ; no one will escape the terrible things I will bring to them. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	42	18	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I showed my anger against the people of Jerusalem . In the same way I will show my anger against you when you go to Egypt . Other nations will speak evil of you . People will be shocked by what will happen to you . You will become a curse word , and people will insult you . And you will never see Judah again. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	42	19	“ You who are left alive in Judah , the Lord has told you , ‘ Don ’ t go to Egypt. ’ Be sure you understand this ; I warn you today
NCV	Jeremiah	42	20	that you are making a mistake that will cause your deaths . You sent me to the Lord your God , saying , ‘ Pray to the Lord our God for us . Tell us everything the Lord our God says , and we will do it. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	42	21	So today I have told you , but you have not obeyed the Lord your God in all that he sent me to tell you .
NCV	Jeremiah	42	22	So now be sure you understand this : You want to go to live in Egypt , but you will die there by war , hunger , or terrible diseases. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	43	43	So Jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the Lord their God ; he told them everything the Lord their God had sent him to tell them .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah , Johanan son of Kareah , and some other men were too proud . They said to Jeremiah , “ You are lying ! The Lord our God did not send you to say , ‘ You must not go to Egypt to live there. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	43	3	Baruch son of Neriah is causing you to be against us . He wants you to hand us over to the Babylonians so they can kill us or capture us and take us to Babylon. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan , the army officers , and all the people disobeyed the Lord ’ s command to stay in Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	5	But Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers led away those who were left alive from Judah . They were the people who had run away from the Babylonians to other countries but then had come back to live in Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	6	They led away the men , women , and children , and the king ’ s daughters . Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan in charge of those people . Johanan also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	7	These people did not listen to the Lord . So they all went to Egypt to the city of Tahpanhes .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	8	In Tahpanhes the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah :
NCV	Jeremiah	43	9	“ Take some large stones . Bury them in the clay in the brick pavement in front of the king of Egypt ’ s palace in Tahpanhes . Do this while the Jews are watching you .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	10	Then say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : I will soon send for my servant , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . I will set his throne over these stones I have buried , and he will spread his covering for shade above them .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	11	He will come here and attack Egypt . He will bring death to those who are supposed to die . He will make prisoners of those who are to be taken captive , and he will bring war to those who are to be killed with a sword .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	12	Nebuchadnezzar will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt and burn them . And he will take the idols away as captives . As a shepherd wraps himself in his clothes , so Nebuchadnezzar will wrap Egypt around him . Then he will safely leave Egypt .
NCV	Jeremiah	43	13	He will destroy the stone pillars in the temple of the sun god in Egypt , and he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	44	44	Jeremiah received a message from the Lord for all the Jews living in Egypt—in the cities of Migdol , Tahpanhes , Memphis , and in southern Egypt . This was the message :
NCV	Jeremiah	44	2	“ The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : You saw all the terrible things I brought on Jerusalem and the towns of Judah , which are ruins today with no one living in them .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	3	It is because the people who lived there did evil . They made me angry by burning incense and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	4	I sent all my servants , the prophets , to you again and again . By them I said to you , ‘ Don ’ t do this terrible thing that I hate. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	44	5	But they did not listen or pay attention . They did not stop doing evil things and burning incense to other gods .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	6	So I showed my great anger against them . I poured out my anger in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem so they are only ruins and piles of stones today .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	7	“ Now the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves ? You are cutting off the men and women , children and babies from the family of Judah , leaving yourselves without anyone from the family of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	8	Why do you want to make me angry by making idols ? Why do you burn incense to the gods of Egypt , where you have come to live ? You will destroy yourselves . Other nations will speak evil of you and make fun of you .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten about the evil things your ancestors did ? And have you forgotten the evil the kings and queens of Judah did ? Have you forgotten about the evil you and your wives did ? These things were done in the country of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	10	Even to this day the people of Judah are still too proud . They have not learned to respect me or to follow my teachings . They have not obeyed the laws I gave you and your ancestors .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	11	“ So this is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : I am determined to bring disasters on you . I will destroy the whole family of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	12	The few who were left alive from Judah were determined to go to Egypt and settle there , but they will all die in Egypt . They will be killed in war or die from hunger . From the least important to the greatest , they will be killed in war or die from hunger . Other nations will speak evil about them . People will be shocked by what has happened to them . They will become a curse word , and people will insult them .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	13	I will punish those people who have gone to live in Egypt , just as I punished Jerusalem , using swords , hunger , and terrible diseases .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	14	Of the people of Judah who were left alive and have gone to live in Egypt , none will escape my punishment . They want to return to Judah and live there , but none of them will live to return to Judah , except a few people who will escape. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	44	15	A large group of the people of Judah who lived in southern Egypt were meeting together . Among them were many women of Judah who were burning incense to other gods , and their husbands knew it . All these people said to Jeremiah ,
NCV	Jeremiah	44	16	“ We will not listen to the message from the Lord that you spoke to us .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	17	We promised to make sacrifices to the Queen Goddess , and we will certainly do everything we promised . We will burn incense and pour out drink offerings to worship her , just as we , our ancestors , kings , and officers did in the past . All of us did these things in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . At that time we had plenty of food and were successful , and nothing bad happened to us .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we stopped making sacrifices to the Queen Goddess and stopped pouring out drink offerings to her , we have had great problems . Our people have also been killed in war and by hunger. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	44	19	The women said , “ Our husbands knew what we were doing . We had their permission to burn incense to the Queen Goddess and to pour out drink offerings to her . Our husbands knew we were making cakes that looked like her and were pouring out drink offerings to her. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people—men and women—who answered him .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	21	He said to them , “ The Lord remembered that you and your ancestors , kings and officers , and the people of the land burned incense in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . He remembered and thought about it .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	22	Then he could not be patient with you any longer . He hated the terrible things you did . So he made your country an empty desert , where no one lives . Other people curse that country . And so it is today .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	23	All this happened because you burned incense to other gods . You sinned against the Lord . You did not obey him or follow his teachings or the laws he gave you . You did not keep your part of the agreement with him . So this disaster has happened to you . It is there for you to see. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	44	24	Then Jeremiah said to all those men and women , “ People of Judah who are now in Egypt , hear the word of the Lord :
NCV	Jeremiah	44	25	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : You and your wives did what you said you would do . You said , ‘ We will certainly keep the promises we made . We promised to make sacrifices to the Queen Goddess and to pour out drink offerings to her. ’ So , go ahead . Do the things you promised , and keep your promises .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	26	But hear the word of the Lord . Listen , all you Jews living in Egypt . The Lord says , ‘ I have sworn by my great name : The people of Judah now living in Egypt will never again use my name to make promises . They will never again say in Egypt , “ As surely as the Lord God lives . . . ”
NCV	Jeremiah	44	27	I am watching over them , not to take care of them , but to hurt them . The Jews who live in Egypt will die from swords or hunger until they are all destroyed .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	28	A few will escape being killed by the sword and will come back to Judah from Egypt . Then , of the people of Judah who came to live in Egypt , those who are left alive will know if my word or their word came true .
NCV	Jeremiah	44	29	I will give you a sign that I will punish you here in Egypt , ’ says the Lord . ‘ When you see it happen , you will know that my promises to hurt you will really happen. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	44	30	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Hophra king of Egypt has enemies who want to kill him . Soon I will hand him over to his enemies just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , who wanted to kill him. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Jeremiah	45	45	It was the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah . Jeremiah the prophet told these things to Baruch son of Neriah , and Baruch wrote them on a scroll :
NCV	Jeremiah	45	2	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says to you , Baruch :
NCV	Jeremiah	45	3	You have said , ‘ How terrible it is for me ! The Lord has given me sorrow along with my pain . I am tired because of my suffering and can not rest. ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	45	4	The Lord said , “ Say this to Baruch : ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will soon tear down what I have built , and I will pull up what I have planted everywhere in Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	45	5	Baruch , you are looking for great things for yourself . Don ’ t look for them , because I will bring disaster on all the people , says the Lord . You will have to go many places , but I will let you escape alive wherever you go. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	46	46	The Lord spoke this word to Jeremiah the prophet about the nations :
NCV	Jeremiah	46	2	This message is to Egypt . It is about the army of Neco king of Egypt , which was defeated at the city of Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . This was in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah . This is the Lord ’ s message to Egypt :
NCV	Jeremiah	46	3	“ Prepare your shields , large and small , and march out for battle !
NCV	Jeremiah	46	4	Harness the horses and get on them ! Go to your places for battle and put on your helmets ! Polish your spears . Put on your armor !
NCV	Jeremiah	46	5	What do I see ? That army is terrified , and the soldiers are running away . Their warriors are defeated . They run away quickly without looking back . There is terror on every side ! ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	6	“ The fast runners can not run away ; the strong soldiers can not escape . They stumble and fall in the north , by the Euphrates River .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	7	Who is this , rising up like the Nile River , like strong , fast rivers ?
NCV	Jeremiah	46	8	Egypt rises up like the Nile River , like strong , fast rivers . Egypt says , ‘ I will rise up and cover the earth . I will destroy cities and the people in them ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	46	9	Horsemen , charge into battle ! Chariot drivers , drive hard ! March on , brave soldiers— soldiers from the countries of Cush and Put who carry shields , soldiers from Lydia who use bows .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	10	“ But that day belongs to the Lord God All-Powerful . At that time he will give those people the punishment they deserve . The sword will kill until it is finished , until it satisfies its thirst for their blood . The Lord God All-Powerful will offer a sacrifice in the land of the north , by the Euphrates River .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	11	“ Go up to Gilead and get some balm , people of Egypt ! You have prepared many medicines , but they will not work ; you will not be healed .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations have heard of your shame , and your cries fill all the earth . One warrior has run into another ; both of them have fallen down together ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	46	13	This is the message the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ’ s coming to attack Egypt :
NCV	Jeremiah	46	14	“ Announce this message in Egypt , and preach it in Migdol . Preach it also in the cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes : ‘ Get ready for war , because the battle is all around you. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	46	15	Egypt , why were your warriors killed ? They could not stand because the Lord pushed them down .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	16	They stumbled again and again and fell over each other . They said , ‘ Get up . Let ’ s go back to our own people and our homeland . We must get away from our enemy ’ s sword ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	46	17	In their homelands those soldiers called out , ‘ The king of Egypt is only a lot of noise . He missed his chance for glory ! ’ ”
NCV	Jeremiah	46	18	The King ’ s name is the Lord All-Powerful . He says , “ As surely as I live , a powerful leader will come . He will be like Mount Tabor among the mountains , like Mount Carmel by the sea .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	19	People of Egypt , pack your things to be taken away as captives , because Memphis will be destroyed . It will be a ruin , and no one will live there .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	20	“ Egypt is like a beautiful young cow , but a horsefly is coming from the north to attack her .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	21	The hired soldiers in Egypt ’ s army are like fat calves , because even they all turn and run away together ; they do not stand strong against the attack . Their time of destruction is coming ; they will soon be punished .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	22	Egypt is like a hissing snake that is trying to escape . The enemy comes closer and closer . They come against Egypt with axes like men who cut down trees .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	23	They will chop down Egypt ’ s army as if it were a great forest , ” says the Lord . “ There are more enemy soldiers than locusts ; there are too many to count .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	24	The people of Egypt will be ashamed . They will be handed over to the enemy from the north. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	46	25	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ Very soon I will punish Amon , the god of the city of Thebes . And I will punish Egypt , her kings , her gods , and the people who depend on the king .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	26	I will hand those people over to their enemies , who want to kill them . I will give them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers . But in the future , Egypt will live in peace as it once did , ” says the Lord . A Message to Israel
NCV	Jeremiah	46	27	“ People of Jacob , my servants , don ’ t be afraid ; don ’ t be frightened , Israel . I will surely save you from those faraway places and your children from the lands where they are captives . The people of Jacob will have peace and safety again , and no one will make them afraid .
NCV	Jeremiah	46	28	People of Jacob , my servants , do not be afraid , because I am with you , ” says the Lord . “ I will completely destroy the many different nations where I scattered you . But I will not completely destroy you . I will punish you fairly , but I will not let you escape your punishment. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	47	47	Before the king of Egypt attacked the city of Gaza , the Lord spoke his word to Jeremiah the prophet . This message is to the Philistine people .
NCV	Jeremiah	47	2	This is what the Lord says : “ See , the enemy is gathering in the north like rising waters . They will become like an overflowing stream and will cover the whole country like a flood , even the towns and the people living in them . Everyone living in that country will cry for help ; the people will cry painfully .
NCV	Jeremiah	47	3	They will hear the sound of the running horses and the noisy chariots and the rumbling chariot wheels . Parents will not help their children to safety , because they will be too weak to help .
NCV	Jeremiah	47	4	The time has come to destroy all the Philistines . It is time to destroy all who are left alive who could help the cities of Tyre and Sidon . The Lord will soon destroy the Philistines , those left alive from the island of Crete .
NCV	Jeremiah	47	5	The people from the city of Gaza will be sad and shave their heads . The people from the city of Ashkelon will be made silent . Those left alive from the valley , how long will you cut yourselves ? [ a ]
NCV	Jeremiah	47	6	“ You cry , ‘ Sword of the Lord , how long will you keep fighting ? Return to your holder . Stop and be still. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	47	7	But how can his sword rest when the Lord has given it a command ? He has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the seacoast. ” Footnotes - 47:5 sad and . . . yourselves The people did these things to show their sadness . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	48	48	This message is to the country of Moab . This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ How terrible it will be for the city of Nebo , because it will be ruined . The town of Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured ; the strong city will be disgraced and shattered .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	2	Moab will not be praised again . Men in the town of Heshbon plan Moab ’ s defeat . They say , ‘ Come , let us put an end to that nation ! ’ Town of Madmen , [ a ] you will also be silenced . The sword will chase you .

NCV	Jeremiah	48	5	Moab ’ s people go up the path to the town of Luhith , crying loudly as they go . On the road down to Horonaim , cries of pain and suffering can be heard .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	6	Run ! Run for your lives ! Go like a bush being blown through the desert .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	7	You trust in the things you do and in your wealth , so you also will be captured . The god Chemosh will go into captivity and his priests and officers with him .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	8	The destroyer will come against every town ; not one town will escape . The valley will be ruined , and the high plain will be destroyed , as the Lord has said .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	9	Give wings to Moab , because she will surely leave her land . Moab ’ s towns will become empty , with no one to live in them .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	10	A curse will be on anyone who doesn ’ t do what the Lord says , and a curse will be on anyone who holds back his sword from killing .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	11	“ The people of Moab have never known trouble . They are like wine left to settle ; they have never been poured from one jar to another . They have not been taken into captivity . So they taste as they did before , and their smell has not changed .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	12	A time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ When I will send people to pour you from your jars . They will empty Moab ’ s jars and smash her jugs .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	13	The people of Israel trusted that god in the town of Bethel , and they were ashamed when there was no help . In the same way Moab will be ashamed of their god Chemosh .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	14	“ You can not say , ‘ We are warriors ! We are brave men in battle ! ’

NCV	Jeremiah	48	26	“ The people of Moab thought they were greater than the Lord , so punish them until they act as if they are drunk . Moab will fall and roll around in its own vomit , and people will even make fun of it .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	27	Moab , you made fun of Israel . Israel was caught in the middle of a gang of thieves . When you spoke about Israel , you shook your head and acted as if you were better than it .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	28	People in Moab , leave your towns empty and go live among the rocks . Be like a dove that makes its nest at the entrance of a cave .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	29	“ We have heard that the people of Moab are proud , very proud . They are proud , very proud , and in their hearts they think they are important. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	48	30	The Lord says , “ I know Moab ’ s great pride , but it is useless . Moab ’ s bragging accomplishes nothing .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	31	So I cry sadly for Moab , for everyone in Moab . I moan for the people from the town of Kir Hareseth .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	32	I cry with the people of the town of Jazer for you , the grapevines of the town of Sibmah . In the past your vines spread all the way to the sea , as far as the sea of Jazer . But the destroyer has taken over your fruit and grapes .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	33	Joy and happiness are gone from the large , rich fields of Moab . I have stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses . No one walks on the grapes with shouts of joy . There are shouts , but not shouts of joy .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	34	“ Their crying can be heard from Moabite towns , from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz . It can be heard from Zoar as far away as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah . Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	35	I will stop Moab from making burnt offerings at the places of worship and from burning incense to their gods , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	48	36	“ My heart cries sadly for Moab like a flute playing a funeral song . It cries like a flute for the people from Kir Hareseth . The money they made has all been taken away .

NCV	Jeremiah	49	49	This message is to the Ammonite people . This is what the Lord says : “ Do you think that Israel has no children ? Do you think there is no one to take the land when the parents die ? If that were true , why did Molech take Gad ’ s land and why did Molech ’ s people settle in Gad ’ s towns ? ”
NCV	Jeremiah	49	2	The Lord says , “ The time will come when I will make Rabbah , the capital city of the Ammonites , hear the battle cry . It will become a hill covered with ruins , and the towns around it will be burned . Those people forced Israel out of that land , but now Israel will force them out ! ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	3	“ People in the town of Heshbon , cry sadly because the town of Ai is destroyed ! Those who live in Rabbah , cry out ! Put on your rough cloth to show your sadness , and cry loudly . Run here and there for safety inside the walls , because Molech will be taken captive and his priests and officers with him .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	4	You brag about your valleys and about the fruit in your valleys . You are like an unfaithful child who believes his treasures will save him . You think , ‘ Who would attack me ? ’
NCV	Jeremiah	49	5	I will soon bring terror on you from everyone around you , ” says the Lord God All-Powerful . “ You will all be forced to run away , and no one will be able to gather you .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	6	“ But the time will come when I will make good things happen to the Ammonites again , ” says the Lord . A Message to Edom
NCV	Jeremiah	49	7	This message is to Edom . This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Is there no more wisdom in the town of Teman ? Can the wise men of Edom no longer give good advice ? Have they lost their wisdom ?
NCV	Jeremiah	49	8	You people living in the town of Dedan , run away and hide in deep caves , because I will bring disaster on the people of Esau . It is time for me to punish them .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	9	If workers came and picked the grapes from your vines , they would leave a few grapes behind . If robbers came at night , they would steal only enough for themselves .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	10	But I will strip Edom bare . I will find all their hiding places , so they will not be able to hide from me . The children , relatives , and neighbors will die , and Edom will be no more .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	11	Leave the orphans , and I will take care of them . Your widows also can trust in me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	49	12	This is what the Lord says : “ Some people did not deserve to be punished , but they had to drink from the cup of suffering anyway . People of Edom , you deserve to be punished , so you will not escape punishment . You must certainly drink from the cup of suffering. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	49	13	The Lord says , “ I swear by my own name that the city of Bozrah will become a pile of ruins ! People will be shocked by what happened there . They will insult that city and speak evil of it . And all the towns around it will become ruins forever. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	49	14	I have heard a message from the Lord . A messenger has been sent among the nations , saying , “ Gather your armies to attack it ! Get ready for battle ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	49	15	“ Soon I will make you the smallest of nations , and you will be greatly hated by everyone .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	16	Edom , you frightened other nations , but your pride has fooled you . You live in the hollow places of the cliff and control the high places of the hills . Even if you build your home as high as an eagle ’ s nest , I will bring you down from there , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	17	“ Edom will be destroyed . People who pass by will be shocked to see the destroyed cities , and they will be amazed at all her injuries .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	18	Edom will be destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them , ” says the Lord . “ No one will live there ! No one will stay in Edom .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	19	“ Like a lion coming up from the thick bushes near the Jordan River to attack a strong pen for sheep , I will suddenly chase Edom from its land . Who is the one I have chosen to do this ? There is no one like me , no one who can take me to court . None of their leaders can stand up against me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	49	20	So listen to what the Lord has planned to do against Edom . Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in the town of Teman . He will surely drag away the young ones of Edom . Their hometowns will surely be shocked at what happens to them .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	21	At the sound of Edom ’ s fall , the earth will shake . Their cry will be heard all the way to the Red Sea .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	22	The Lord is like an eagle swooping down and spreading its wings over the city of Bozrah . At that time Edom ’ s soldiers will become very frightened , like a woman having a baby . A Message to Damascus
NCV	Jeremiah	49	23	This message is to the city of Damascus : “ The towns of Hamath and Arpad are put to shame , because they have heard bad news . They are discouraged . They are troubled like the tossing sea .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	24	The city of Damascus has become weak . The people want to run away ; they are ready to panic . The people feel pain and suffering , like a woman giving birth to a baby .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	25	Damascus was a city of my joy . Why have the people not left that famous city yet ?
NCV	Jeremiah	49	26	Surely the young men will die in the city squares , and all her soldiers will be killed at that time , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	27	“ I will set fire to the walls of Damascus , and it will completely burn the strong cities of King Ben-Hadad. ” A Message to Kedar and Hazor
NCV	Jeremiah	49	28	This message is to the tribe of Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated . This is what the Lord says : “ Go and attack the people of Kedar , and destroy the people of the East .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	29	Their tents and flocks will be taken away . Their belongings will be carried off— their tents , all their goods , and their camels . Men will shout to them , ‘ Terror on every side ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	49	30	“ Run away quickly ! People in Hazor , find a good place to hide ! ” says the Lord . “ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has made plans against you and wants to defeat you .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	31	“ Get up ! Attack the nation that is comfortable , that is sure no one will defeat it , ” says the Lord . “ It does not have gates or fences to protect it . Its people live alone .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	32	The enemy will steal their camels and their large herds of cattle as war prizes . I will scatter the people who cut their hair short to every part of the earth , and I will bring disaster on them from everywhere , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	33	“ The city of Hazor will become a home for wild dogs ; it will be an empty desert forever . No one will live there , and no one will stay in it. ” A Message to Elam
NCV	Jeremiah	49	34	Soon after Zedekiah became king of Judah , the Lord spoke this word to Jeremiah the prophet . This message is to the nation of Elam .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	35	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ I will soon break Elam ’ s bow , its greatest strength .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	36	I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the skies . I will scatter its people everywhere the four winds blow ; its captives will go to every nation .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	37	I will terrify Elam in front of their enemies , who want to destroy them . I will bring disaster to Elam and show them how angry I am ! ” says the Lord . “ I will send a sword to chase Elam until I have killed them all .
NCV	Jeremiah	49	38	I will set up my throne in Elam to show that I am king , and I will destroy its king and its officers ! ” says the Lord .

NCV	Jeremiah	50	50	This is the message the Lord spoke to Babylon and the Babylonian people through Jeremiah the prophet .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	2	“ Announce this to the nations . Lift up a banner and tell them . Speak the whole message and say : ‘ Babylon will be captured . The god Bel will be put to shame , and the god Marduk will be afraid . Babylon ’ s gods will be put to shame , and her idols will be afraid ! ’
NCV	Jeremiah	50	3	A nation from the north will attack Babylon and make it like an empty desert . No one will live there ; both people and animals will run away. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	50	4	The Lord says , “ At that time the people of Israel and Judah will come together . They will cry and look for the Lord their God .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	5	Those people will ask how to go to Jerusalem and will start in that direction . They will come and join themselves to the Lord . They will make an agreement with him that will last forever , an agreement that will never be forgotten .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	6	“ My people have been like lost sheep . Their leaders have led them in the wrong way and made them wander around in the mountains and hills . They forgot where their resting place was .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	7	Whoever saw my people hurt them . And those enemies said , ‘ We did nothing wrong . Those people sinned against the Lord , their true resting place , the God their fathers trusted. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	50	8	“ Run away from Babylon , and leave the land of the Babylonians . Be like the goats that lead the flock .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	9	I will soon bring against Babylon many great nations from the north . They will take their places for war against it , and it will be captured by people from the north . Their arrows are like trained soldiers who do not return from war with empty hands .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	10	The enemy will take all the wealth from the Babylonians . Those enemy soldiers will get all they want , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	11	“ Babylon , you are excited and happy , because you took my land . You dance around like a young cow in the grain . Your laughter is like the neighing of male horses .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	12	Your mother will be very ashamed ; the woman who gave birth to you will be disgraced . Soon Babylonia will be the least important of all the nations . She will be an empty , dry desert .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the Lord ’ s anger , no one will live there . She will be completely empty . Everyone who passes by Babylon will be shocked . They will shake their heads when they see all her injuries .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	14	“ Take your positions for war against Babylon , all you soldiers with bows . Shoot your arrows at Babylon ! Do not save any of them , because Babylon has sinned against the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	15	Soldiers around Babylon , shout the war cry ! Babylon has surrendered , her towers have fallen , and her walls have been torn down . The Lord is giving her people the punishment they deserve . You nations should give her what she deserves ; do to her what she has done to others .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	16	Don ’ t let the people from Babylon plant their crops or gather the harvest . The soldiers treated their captives cruelly . Now , let everyone go back home . Let everyone run to his own country .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	17	“ The people of Israel are like a flock of sheep that are scattered from being chased by lions . The first lion to eat them up was the king of Assyria . The last lion to crush their bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	50	18	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ I will punish the king of Babylon and his country as I punished the king of Assyria .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	19	But I will bring the people of Israel back to their own pasture . They will eat on Mount Carmel and in Bashan . They will eat and be full on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	50	20	The Lord says , “ At that time people will try to find Israel ’ s guilt , but there will be no guilt . People will try to find Judah ’ s sins , but no sins will be found , because I will leave a few people alive from Israel and Judah , and I will forgive their sins .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	21	“ Attack the land of Merathaim . Attack the people who live in Pekod . Chase them , kill them , and completely destroy them . Do everything I commanded you ! ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	22	“ The noise of battle can be heard all over the country ; it is the noise of much destruction .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	23	Babylon was the hammer of the whole earth , but how broken and shattered that hammer is now . It is truly the most ruined of all the nations .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	24	Babylon , I set a trap for you , and you were caught before you knew it . You fought against the Lord , so you were found and taken prisoner .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	25	The Lord has opened up his storeroom and brought out the weapons of his anger , because the Lord God All-Powerful has work to do in the land of the Babylonians .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	26	Come against Babylon from far away . Break open her storehouses of grain . Pile up her dead bodies like heaps of grain . Completely destroy Babylon and do not leave anyone alive .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	27	Kill all the young men in Babylon ; let them be killed like animals . How terrible it will be for them , because the time has come for their defeat ; it is time for them to be punished .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	28	Listen to the people running to escape the country of Babylon ! They are telling Jerusalem how the Lord our God is punishing Babylon as it deserves for destroying his Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	29	“ Call for the archers to come against Babylon . Tell them to surround the city , and let no one escape . Pay her back for what she has done ; do to her what she has done to other nations . Babylon acted with pride against the Lord , the Holy One of Israel .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	30	So her young men will be killed in her streets . All her soldiers will die on that day , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	31	“ Babylon , you are too proud , and I am against you , ” says the Lord God All-Powerful . “ The time has come for you to be punished .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	32	Proud Babylon will stumble and fall , and no one will help her get up . I will start a fire in her towns , and it will burn up everything around her. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	50	33	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ The people of Israel and Judah are slaves . The enemy took them as prisoners and won ’ t let them go .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	34	But God is strong and will buy them back . His name is the Lord All-Powerful . He will surely defend them with power so he can give rest to their land . But he will not give rest to those living in Babylon. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	50	35	The Lord says , “ Let a sword kill the people living in Babylon and her officers and wise men !
NCV	Jeremiah	50	36	Let a sword kill her false prophets , and they will become fools . Let a sword kill her warriors , and they will be full of terror .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	37	Let a sword kill her horses and chariots and all the soldiers hired from other countries ! Then they will be like frightened women . Let a sword attack her treasures , so they will be taken away .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	38	Let a sword attack her waters so they will be dried up . She is a land of idols , and the people go crazy with fear over them .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	39	“ Desert animals and hyenas will live there , and owls will live there , but no people will ever live there again . She will never be filled with people again .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	40	God completely destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them , ” says the Lord . “ In the same way no people will live in Babylon , and no human being will stay there .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	41	“ Look ! An army is coming from the north . A powerful nation and many kings are coming together from all around the world .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	42	Their armies have bows and spears . The soldiers are cruel and have no mercy . As the soldiers come riding on their horses , the sound is loud like the roaring sea . They stand in their places , ready for battle . They are ready to attack you , city of Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Babylon heard about those armies , and he became helpless with fear . Distress has gripped him . His pain is like that of a woman giving birth to a baby .
NCV	Jeremiah	50	44	“ Like a lion coming up from the thick bushes near the Jordan River to attack a strong pen for sheep , I will suddenly chase the people of Babylon from their land . Who is the one I have chosen to do this ? There is no one like me , no one who can take me to court . None of their leaders can stand up against me. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	50	45	So listen to what the Lord has planned to do against Babylon . Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in the city of Babylon . He will surely drag away the young ones of Babylon . Their hometowns will surely be shocked at what happens to them .

NCV	Jeremiah	51	51	“ We people of Judah are disgraced , because we have been insulted . We have been shamed , because strangers have gone into the holy places of the Lord ’ s Temple ! ”
NCV	Jeremiah	51	2	I will send foreign people to destroy Babylon like a wind that blows chaff away . They will destroy the land . Armies will surround the city when the day of disaster comes upon her .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	3	Don ’ t let the Babylonian soldiers prepare their bows to shoot . Don ’ t even let them put on their armor . Don ’ t feel sorry for the young men of Babylon , but completely destroy her army .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	4	They will be killed in the land of the Babylonians and will die in her streets .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	5	The Lord God All-Powerful did not leave Israel and Judah , even though they were completely guilty in the presence of the Holy One of Israel .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	6	“ Run away from Babylon and save your lives ! Don ’ t stay and be killed because of Babylon ’ s sins . It is time for the Lord to punish Babylon ; he will give Babylon the punishment she deserves .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon was like a gold cup in the Lord ’ s hand that made the whole earth drunk . The nations drank Babylon ’ s wine , so they went crazy .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	8	Babylon has suddenly fallen and been broken . Cry for her ! Get balm for her pain , and maybe she can be healed .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	9	“ Foreigners in Babylon say , ‘ We tried to heal Babylon , but she can not be healed . So let us leave her and each go to his own country . Babylon ’ s punishment is as high as the sky ; it reaches to the clouds. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	51	10	“ The people of Judah say , ‘ The Lord has shown us to be right . Come , let us tell in Jerusalem what the Lord our God has done. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	51	11	“ Sharpen the arrows ! Pick up your shields ! The Lord has stirred up the kings of the Medes , because he wants to destroy Babylon . The Lord will punish them as they deserve for destroying his Temple .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	12	Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon ! Bring more guards . Put the watchmen in their places , and get ready for a secret attack ! The Lord will certainly do what he has planned and what he said he would do against the people of Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	13	People of Babylon , you live near much water and are rich with many treasures , but your end as a nation has come . It is time to stop you from robbing other nations .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	14	The Lord All-Powerful has promised in his own name : ‘ Babylon , I will surely fill you with so many enemy soldiers they will be like a swarm of locusts . They will stand over you and shout their victory. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	51	15	“ The Lord made the earth by his power . He used his wisdom to build the world and his understanding to stretch out the skies .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	16	When he thunders , the waters in the skies roar . He makes clouds rise in the sky all over the earth . He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	17	“ People are so stupid and know so little . Goldsmiths are made ashamed by their idols , because those statues are only false gods . They have no breath in them .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	18	They are worth nothing ; people make fun of them . When they are judged , they will be destroyed .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	19	But God , who is Jacob ’ s Portion , is not like the idols . He made everything , and he chose Israel to be his special people . The Lord All-Powerful is his name .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	20	“ You are my war club , my battle weapon . I use you to smash nations . I use you to destroy kingdoms .

NCV	Jeremiah	51	27	“ Lift up a banner in the land ! Blow the trumpet among the nations ! Get the nations ready for battle against Babylon .

NCV	Jeremiah	51	31	One messenger follows another ; messenger follows messenger . They announce to the king of Babylon that his whole city has been captured .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	32	The river crossings have been captured , and the swamplands are burning . All of Babylon ’ s soldiers are terribly afraid. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	51	33	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ The city of Babylon is like a threshing floor , where people crush the grain at harvest time . The time to harvest Babylon is coming soon. ”
NCV	Jeremiah	51	34	“ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has defeated and destroyed us . In the past he took our people away , and we became like an empty jar . He was like a giant snake that swallowed us . He filled his stomach with our best things . Then he spit us out .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	35	Babylon did terrible things to hurt us . Now let those things happen to Babylon , ” say the people of Jerusalem . “ The people of Babylon killed our people . Now let them be punished for what they did , ” says Jerusalem .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	36	So this is what the Lord says : “ I will soon defend you , Judah , and make sure that Babylon is punished . I will dry up Babylon ’ s sea and make her springs become dry .

NCV	Jeremiah	51	45	“ Come out of Babylon , my people ! Run for your lives ! Run from the Lord ’ s great anger .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	46	Don ’ t lose courage ; rumors will spread through the land , but don ’ t be afraid . One rumor comes this year , and another comes the next year . There will be rumors of terrible fighting in the country , of rulers fighting against rulers .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	47	The time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon , and the whole land will be disgraced . There will be many dead people lying all around .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	48	Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy about Babylon . They will shout because the army comes from the north to destroy Babylon , ” says the Lord .

NCV	Jeremiah	51	50	You who have escaped being killed with swords , leave Babylon ! Don ’ t wait ! Remember the Lord in the faraway land and think about Jerusalem. ”

NCV	Jeremiah	51	53	Even if Babylon grows until she touches the sky , and even if she makes her highest cities strong , I will send people to destroy her , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	54	“ Sounds of people crying are heard in Babylon . Sounds of people destroying things are heard in the land of the Babylonians .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	55	The Lord is destroying Babylon and making the loud sounds of the city become silent . Enemies come roaring in like ocean waves . The roar of their voices is heard all around .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	56	The army has come to destroy Babylon . Her soldiers have been captured , and their bows are broken , because the Lord is a God who punishes people for the evil they do . He gives them the full punishment they deserve .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	57	I will make Babylon ’ s rulers and wise men drunk , and her governors , officers , and soldiers , too . Then they will sleep forever and never wake up , ” says the King , whose name is the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	58	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Babylon ’ s thick wall will be completely pulled down and her high gates burned . The people will work hard , but it won ’ t help ; their work will only become fuel for the flames ! ” A Message to Babylon
NCV	Jeremiah	51	59	This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet gave to the officer Seraiah son of Neriah , who was the son of Mahseiah . Seraiah went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year Zedekiah was king of Judah . His duty was to arrange the king ’ s food and housing on the trip .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	60	Jeremiah had written on a scroll all the terrible things that would happen to Babylon , all these words about Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	61	Jeremiah said to Seraiah , “ As soon as you come to Babylon , be sure to read this message so all the people can hear you .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	62	Then say , ‘ Lord , you have said that you will destroy this place so that no people or animals will live in it . It will be an empty ruin forever. ’
NCV	Jeremiah	51	63	After you finish reading this scroll , tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River .
NCV	Jeremiah	51	64	Then say , ‘ In the same way Babylon will sink and will not rise again because of the terrible things I will make happen here . Her people will fall. ’ ” The words of Jeremiah end here . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jeremiah	52	52	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king , and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years . His mother ’ s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah , [ a ] and she was from Libnah .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	2	Zedekiah did what the Lord said was wrong , just as Jehoiakim had done .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	3	All this happened in Jerusalem and Judah because the Lord was angry with them . Finally , he threw them out of his presence . Zedekiah turned against the king of Babylon .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	4	Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army . They made a camp around the city and built devices all around the city walls to attack it . This happened on Zedekiah ’ s ninth year , tenth month , and tenth day as king .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	5	And the city was under attack until Zedekiah ’ s eleventh year as king .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	6	By the ninth day of the fourth month , the hunger was terrible in the city ; there was no food for the people to eat .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	7	Then the city wall was broken through , and the whole army of Judah ran away at night . They left the city through the gate between the two walls by the king ’ s garden . Even though the Babylonians were surrounding the city , Zedekiah and his men headed toward the Jordan Valley .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	8	But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah and caught him in the plains of Jericho . All of his army was scattered from him .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	9	So the Babylonians captured Zedekiah and took him to the king of Babylon at the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath . There he passed sentence on Zedekiah .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	10	At Riblah the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah ’ s sons as he watched . The king also killed all the officers of Judah .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	11	Then he put out Zedekiah ’ s eyes , and put bronze chains on him , and took him to Babylon . And the king kept Zedekiah in prison there until the day he died .
NCV	Jeremiah	52	12	Nebuzaradan , commander of the king ’ s special guards and servant of the king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem on the tenth day of the fifth month . This was in Nebuchadnezzar ’ s nineteenth year as king of Babylon .

NCV	Jeremiah	52	15	Nebuzaradan , the commander of the king ’ s special guards , took captive some of the poorest people , those who were left in Jerusalem , those who had surrendered to the king of Babylon , and the skilled craftsmen who were left in Jerusalem .

NCV	Lamentations	1	1	Jerusalem once was full of people , but now the city is empty . Jerusalem once was a great city among the nations , but now she [ a ] is like a widow . She was like a queen of all the other cities , but now she is a slave .
NCV	Lamentations	1	2	She cries loudly at night , and tears are on her cheeks . There is no one to comfort her ; all who loved her are gone . All her friends have turned against her and are now her enemies .
NCV	Lamentations	1	3	Judah has gone into captivity where she suffers and works hard . She lives among other nations , but she has found no rest . Those who chased her caught her when she was in trouble .
NCV	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Jerusalem are sad , because no one comes for the feasts . No one passes through her gates . Her priests groan , her young women are suffering , and Jerusalem suffers terribly .
NCV	Lamentations	1	5	Her foes are now her masters . Her enemies enjoy the wealth they have taken . The Lord is punishing her for her many sins . Her children have gone away as captives of the enemy .
NCV	Lamentations	1	6	The beauty of Jerusalem has gone away . Her rulers are like deer that can not find food . They are weak and run from the hunters .
NCV	Lamentations	1	7	Jerusalem is suffering and homeless . She remembers all the good things from the past . But her people were defeated by the enemy , and there was no one to help her . When her enemies saw her , they laughed to see her ruined .
NCV	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem sinned terribly , so she has become unclean . Those who honored her now hate her , because they have seen her nakedness . She groans and turns away .
NCV	Lamentations	1	9	She made herself dirty by her sins and did not think about what would happen to her . Her defeat was surprising , and no one could comfort her . She says , “ Lord , see how I suffer , because the enemy has won. ”
NCV	Lamentations	1	10	The enemy reached out and took all her precious things . She even saw foreigners enter her Temple . The Lord had commanded foreigners never to enter the meeting place of his people .
NCV	Lamentations	1	11	All of Jerusalem ’ s people groan , looking for bread . They are trading their precious things for food so they can stay alive . The city says , “ Look , Lord , and see . I am hated. ”
NCV	Lamentations	1	12	Jerusalem says , “ You who pass by on the road don ’ t seem to care . Come , look at me and see : Is there any pain like mine ? Is there any pain like that he has caused me ? The Lord has punished me on the day of his great anger .
NCV	Lamentations	1	13	“ He sent fire from above that went down into my bones . He stretched out a net for my feet and turned me back . He made me so sad and lonely that I am weak all day .
NCV	Lamentations	1	14	“ He has noticed my sins ; they are tied together by his hands ; they hang around my neck . He has turned my strength into weakness . The Lord has handed me over to those who are stronger than I .
NCV	Lamentations	1	15	“ The Lord has rejected all my mighty men inside my walls . He brought an army against me to destroy my young men . As if in a winepress , the Lord has crushed the capital city of Judah .
NCV	Lamentations	1	16	“ I cry about these things ; my eyes overflow with tears . There is no one near to comfort me , no one who can give me strength again . My children are left sad and lonely , because the enemy has won. ”
NCV	Lamentations	1	17	Jerusalem reaches out her hands , but there is no one to comfort her . The Lord commanded the people of Jacob to be surrounded by their enemies . Jerusalem is now unclean like those around her .
NCV	Lamentations	1	18	Jerusalem says , “ The Lord is right , but I refused to obey him . Listen , all you people , and look at my pain . My young women and men have gone into captivity .
NCV	Lamentations	1	19	“ I called out to my friends , but they turned against me . My priests and my elders have died in the city while looking for food to stay alive .
NCV	Lamentations	1	20	“ Look at me , Lord . I am upset and greatly troubled . My heart is troubled , because I have been so stubborn . Out in the streets , the sword kills ; inside the houses , death destroys .
NCV	Lamentations	1	21	“ People have heard my groaning , and there is no one to comfort me . All my enemies have heard of my trouble , and they are happy you have done this to me . Now bring that day you have announced so that my enemies will be like me .
NCV	Lamentations	1	22	“ Look at all their evil . Do to them what you have done to me because of all my sins . I groan over and over again , and I am afraid. ” Footnotes - 1:1 she In this poem the city of Jerusalem is described as a woman . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord swallowed up without mercy all the houses of the people of Jacob ; in his anger he pulled down the strong places of Judah . He threw her kingdom and its rulers down to the ground in dishonor .
NCV	Lamentations	2	3	In his anger he has removed all the strength of Israel ; he took away his power from Israel when the enemy came . He burned against the people of Jacob like a flaming fire that burns up everything around it .
NCV	Lamentations	2	4	Like an enemy , he prepared to shoot his bow , and his hand was against us . Like an enemy , he killed all the good-looking people ; he poured out his anger like fire on the tents of Jerusalem .
NCV	Lamentations	2	5	The Lord was like an enemy ; he swallowed up Israel . He swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed all her strongholds . He has caused more moaning and groaning for Judah .
NCV	Lamentations	2	6	He cut down his Temple like a garden ; he destroyed the meeting place . The Lord has made Jerusalem forget the set feasts and Sabbath days . He has rejected the king and the priest in his great anger .
NCV	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his Temple . He has handed over to the enemy the walls of Jerusalem ’ s palaces . Their uproar in the Lord ’ s Temple was like that of a feast day .
NCV	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord planned to destroy the wall around Jerusalem . He measured the wall and did not stop himself from destroying it . He made the walls and defenses sad ; together they have fallen .
NCV	Lamentations	2	9	Jerusalem ’ s gates have fallen to the ground ; he destroyed and smashed the bars of the gates . Her king and her princes are among the nations . The teaching of the Lord has stopped , and the prophets do not have visions from the Lord .
NCV	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of Jerusalem sit on the ground in silence . They throw dust on their heads and put on rough cloth to show their sadness . The young women of Jerusalem bow their heads to the ground in sorrow .
NCV	Lamentations	2	11	My eyes have no more tears , and I am sick to my stomach . I feel empty inside , because my people have been destroyed . Children and babies are fainting in the streets of the city .
NCV	Lamentations	2	12	They ask their mothers , “ Where is the grain and wine ? ” They faint like wounded soldiers in the streets of the city and die in their mothers ’ arms .
NCV	Lamentations	2	13	What can I say about you , Jerusalem ? What can I compare you to ? What can I say you are like ? How can I comfort you , Jerusalem ? Your ruin is as deep as the sea . No one can heal you .
NCV	Lamentations	2	14	Your prophets saw visions , but they were false and worth nothing . They did not point out your sins to keep you from being captured . They preached what was false and led you wrongly .
NCV	Lamentations	2	15	All who pass by on the road clap their hands at you ; they make fun of Jerusalem and shake their heads . They ask , “ Is this the city that people called the most beautiful city , the happiest place on earth ? ”
NCV	Lamentations	2	16	All your enemies open their mouths to speak against you . They make fun and grind their teeth in anger . They say , “ We have swallowed you up . This is the day we were waiting for ! We have finally seen it happen. ”
NCV	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord has done what he planned ; he has kept his word that he commanded long ago . He has destroyed without mercy , and he has let your enemies laugh at you . He has strengthened your enemies .
NCV	Lamentations	2	18	The people cry out to the Lord . Wall of Jerusalem , let your tears flow like a river day and night . Do not stop or let your eyes rest .
NCV	Lamentations	2	19	Get up , cry out in the night , even as the night begins . Pour out your heart like water in prayer to the Lord . Lift up your hands in prayer to him for the life of your children who are fainting with hunger on every street corner .
NCV	Lamentations	2	20	Jerusalem says : “ Look , Lord , and see to whom you have done this . Women eat their own babies , the children they have cared for . Priests and prophets are killed in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Lamentations	2	21	“ People young and old lie outside on the ground . My young women and young men have been killed by the sword . You killed them on the day of your anger ; you killed them without mercy .
NCV	Lamentations	2	22	“ You invited terrors to come against me on every side , as if you were inviting them to a feast . No one escaped or remained alive on the day of the Lord ’ s anger . My enemy has killed those I cared for and brought up. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Lamentations	3	3	He turned his hand against me again and again , all day long .
NCV	Lamentations	3	2	He led me into darkness , not light .
NCV	Lamentations	3	4	He wore out my flesh and skin and broke my bones .
NCV	Lamentations	3	5	He surrounded me with sadness and attacked me with grief .
NCV	Lamentations	3	6	He made me sit in the dark , like those who have been dead a long time .
NCV	Lamentations	3	7	He shut me in so I could not get out ; he put heavy chains on me .
NCV	Lamentations	3	8	I cry out and beg for help , but he ignores my prayer .
NCV	Lamentations	3	9	He blocked my way with a stone wall and led me in the wrong direction .
NCV	Lamentations	3	10	He is like a bear ready to attack me , like a lion in hiding .
NCV	Lamentations	3	11	He led me the wrong way and let me stray and left me without help .
NCV	Lamentations	3	12	He prepared to shoot his bow and made me the target for his arrows .
NCV	Lamentations	3	13	He shot me in the kidneys with the arrows from his bag .
NCV	Lamentations	3	14	I was a joke to all my people , who make fun of me with songs all day long .
NCV	Lamentations	3	15	The Lord filled me with misery ; he made me drunk with suffering .
NCV	Lamentations	3	16	He broke my teeth with gravel and trampled me into the dirt .
NCV	Lamentations	3	17	I have no more peace . I have forgotten what happiness is .
NCV	Lamentations	3	18	I said , “ My strength is gone , and I have no hope in the Lord. ”
NCV	Lamentations	3	19	Lord , remember my suffering and my misery , my sorrow and trouble .
NCV	Lamentations	3	20	Please remember me and think about me .
NCV	Lamentations	3	21	But I have hope when I think of this :
NCV	Lamentations	3	22	The Lord ’ s love never ends ; his mercies never stop .
NCV	Lamentations	3	23	They are new every morning ; Lord , your loyalty is great .
NCV	Lamentations	3	24	I say to myself , “ The Lord is mine , so I hope in him. ”
NCV	Lamentations	3	25	The Lord is good to those who hope in him , to those who seek him .
NCV	Lamentations	3	26	It is good to wait quietly for the Lord to save .
NCV	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for someone to work hard while he is young .
NCV	Lamentations	3	28	He should sit alone and be quiet ; the Lord has given him hard work to do .
NCV	Lamentations	3	29	He should bow down to the ground ; maybe there is still hope .
NCV	Lamentations	3	30	He should let anyone slap his cheek ; he should be filled with shame .
NCV	Lamentations	3	31	The Lord will not reject his people forever .
NCV	Lamentations	3	32	Although he brings sorrow , he also has mercy and great love .
NCV	Lamentations	3	33	He does not like to punish people or make them sad .
NCV	Lamentations	3	34	He sees if any prisoner of the earth is crushed under his feet ;
NCV	Lamentations	3	35	he sees if someone is treated unfairly before the Most High God ;
NCV	Lamentations	3	36	the Lord sees if someone is cheated in his case in court .
NCV	Lamentations	3	37	Nobody can speak and have it happen unless the Lord commands it .
NCV	Lamentations	3	38	Both bad and good things come by the command of the Most High God .
NCV	Lamentations	3	39	No one should complain when he is punished for his sins .
NCV	Lamentations	3	40	Let us examine and see what we have done and then return to the Lord .
NCV	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift up our hands and pray from our hearts to God in heaven :
NCV	Lamentations	3	42	“ We have sinned and turned against you , and you have not forgiven us .
NCV	Lamentations	3	43	“ You wrapped yourself in anger and chased us ; you killed us without mercy .
NCV	Lamentations	3	44	You wrapped yourself in a cloud , and no prayer could get through .
NCV	Lamentations	3	45	You made us like scum and trash among the other nations .
NCV	Lamentations	3	46	“ All of our enemies open their mouths and speak against us .
NCV	Lamentations	3	47	We have been frightened and fearful , ruined and destroyed. ”
NCV	Lamentations	3	48	Streams of tears flow from my eyes , because my people are destroyed .
NCV	Lamentations	3	49	My tears flow continually , without stopping ,
NCV	Lamentations	3	50	until the Lord looks down and sees from heaven .
NCV	Lamentations	3	51	I am sad when I see what has happened to all the women of my city .
NCV	Lamentations	3	52	Those who are my enemies for no reason hunted me like a bird .
NCV	Lamentations	3	53	They tried to kill me in a pit ; they threw stones at me .
NCV	Lamentations	3	54	Water came up over my head , and I said , “ I am going to die. ”
NCV	Lamentations	3	55	I called out to you , Lord , from the bottom of the pit .
NCV	Lamentations	3	56	You heard me calling , “ Do not close your ears and ignore my gasps and shouts. ”
NCV	Lamentations	3	57	You came near when I called to you ; you said , “ Don ’ t be afraid. ”
NCV	Lamentations	3	58	Lord , you have taken my case and given me back my life .
NCV	Lamentations	3	59	Lord , you have seen how I have been wronged . Now judge my case for me .
NCV	Lamentations	3	60	You have seen how my enemies took revenge on me and made evil plans against me .
NCV	Lamentations	3	61	Lord , you have heard their insults and all their evil plans against me .
NCV	Lamentations	3	62	The words and thoughts of my enemies are against me all the time .
NCV	Lamentations	3	63	Look ! In everything they do they make fun of me with songs .
NCV	Lamentations	3	64	Pay them back , Lord , for what they have done .
NCV	Lamentations	3	65	Make them stubborn , and put your curse on them .

NCV	Lamentations	4	4	The babies are so thirsty their tongues stick to the roofs of their mouths . Children beg for bread , but no one gives them any .
NCV	Lamentations	4	2	The precious people of Jerusalem were more valuable than gold , but now they are thought of as clay jars made by the hands of a potter .
NCV	Lamentations	4	3	Even wild dogs give their milk to feed their young , but my people are cruel like ostriches in the desert .
NCV	Lamentations	4	5	Those who once ate fine foods are now starving in the streets . People who grew up wearing nice clothes now pick through trash piles .
NCV	Lamentations	4	6	My people have been punished more than Sodom was . Sodom was destroyed suddenly , and no hands reached out to help her .
NCV	Lamentations	4	7	Our princes were purer than snow , and whiter than milk . Their bodies were redder than rubies ; they looked like sapphires .
NCV	Lamentations	4	8	But now they are blacker than coal , and no one recognizes them in the streets . Their skin hangs on their bones ; it is as dry as wood .
NCV	Lamentations	4	9	Those who were killed in the war were better off than those killed by hunger . They starve in pain and die , because there is no food from the field .
NCV	Lamentations	4	10	With their own hands kind women cook their own children . They became food when my people were destroyed .
NCV	Lamentations	4	11	The Lord turned loose all of his anger ; he poured out his strong anger . He set fire to Jerusalem , burning it down to the foundations .
NCV	Lamentations	4	12	Kings of the earth and people of the world could not believe that enemies and foes could enter the gates of Jerusalem .
NCV	Lamentations	4	13	It happened because her prophets sinned and her priests did evil . They killed in the city those who did what was right .
NCV	Lamentations	4	14	They wandered in the streets as if they were blind . They were dirty with blood , so no one would touch their clothes .
NCV	Lamentations	4	15	“ Go away ! You are unclean , ” people shouted at them . “ Get away ! Get away ! Don ’ t touch us ! ” So they ran away and wandered . Even the other nations said , “ Don ’ t stay here. ”
NCV	Lamentations	4	16	The Lord himself scattered them and did not look after them anymore . No one respects the priests or honors the elders .
NCV	Lamentations	4	17	Also , our eyes grew tired , looking for help that never came . We kept watch from our towers for a nation to save us .
NCV	Lamentations	4	18	Our enemies hunted us , so we could not even walk in the streets . Our end is near . Our time is up . Our end has come .
NCV	Lamentations	4	19	Those who chased us were faster than eagles in the sky . They ran us into the mountains and ambushed us in the desert .
NCV	Lamentations	4	20	The Lord ’ s appointed king , who was our very breath , was caught in their traps . We had said about him , “ We will be protected by him among the nations. ”
NCV	Lamentations	4	21	Be happy and glad , people of Edom , you who live in the land of Uz . The cup of God ’ s anger will come to you ; then you will get drunk and go naked .
NCV	Lamentations	4	22	Your punishment is complete , Jerusalem . He will not send you into captivity again . But the Lord will punish the sins of Edom ; he will uncover your evil . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Lamentations	5	5	Those who chase after us want to catch us by the neck . We are tired and find no rest .
NCV	Lamentations	5	2	Our land has been turned over to strangers ; our houses have been given to foreigners .
NCV	Lamentations	5	3	We are like orphans with no father ; our mothers are like widows .
NCV	Lamentations	5	4	We have to buy the water we drink ; we must pay for the firewood .
NCV	Lamentations	5	6	We made an agreement with Egypt and with Assyria to get enough food .
NCV	Lamentations	5	7	Our ancestors sinned against you , but they are gone ; now we suffer because of their sins .
NCV	Lamentations	5	8	Slaves have become our rulers , and no one can save us from them .
NCV	Lamentations	5	9	We risk our lives to get our food ; we face death in the desert .
NCV	Lamentations	5	10	Our skin is hot like an oven ; we burn with starvation .
NCV	Lamentations	5	11	The enemy abused the women of Jerusalem and the girls in the cities of Judah .
NCV	Lamentations	5	12	Princes were hung by the hands ; they did not respect our elders .
NCV	Lamentations	5	13	The young men ground grain at the mill , and boys stumbled under loads of wood .
NCV	Lamentations	5	14	The elders no longer sit at the city gates ; the young men no longer sing .
NCV	Lamentations	5	15	We have no more joy in our hearts ; our dancing has turned to sadness .
NCV	Lamentations	5	16	The crown has fallen from our head . How terrible it is because we sinned .
NCV	Lamentations	5	17	Because of this we are afraid , and now our eyes are dim .
NCV	Lamentations	5	18	Mount Zion is empty , and wild dogs wander around it .
NCV	Lamentations	5	19	But you rule forever , Lord . You will be King from now on .
NCV	Lamentations	5	20	Why have you forgotten us for so long ? Have you left us forever ?
NCV	Lamentations	5	21	Bring us back to you , Lord , and we will return . Make our days as they were before ,

NCV	Ezekiel	1	1	It was the thirtieth year , on the fifth day of the fourth month of our captivity . I was by the Kebar River among the people who had been carried away as captives . The sky opened , and I saw visions of God .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	2	It was the fifth day of the month of the fifth year that King Jehoiachin had been a prisoner .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	3	The Lord spoke his word to Ezekiel son of Buzi in the land of the Babylonians by the Kebar River . There he felt the power of the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	4	When I looked , I saw a stormy wind coming from the north . There was a great cloud with a bright light around it and fire flashing out of it . Something that looked like glowing metal was in the center of the fire .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	5	Inside the cloud was what looked like four living creatures , who were shaped like humans ,
NCV	Ezekiel	1	6	but each of them had four faces and four wings .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight . Their feet were like a calf ’ s hoofs and sparkled like polished bronze .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	8	The living creatures had human hands under their wings on their four sides . All four of them had faces and wings ,
NCV	Ezekiel	1	9	and their wings touched each other . The living creatures did not turn when they moved , but each went straight ahead .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	10	Their faces looked like this : Each living creature had a human face and the face of a lion on the right side and the face of an ox on the left side . And each one also had the face of an eagle .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	11	That was what their faces looked like . Their wings were spread out above . Each had two wings that touched one of the other living creatures and two wings that covered its body .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	12	Each went straight ahead . Wherever the spirit would go , the living creatures would also go , without turning .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	13	The living creatures looked like burning coals of fire or like torches . Fire went back and forth among the living creatures . It was bright , and lightning flashed from it .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	14	The living creatures ran back and forth like bolts of lightning .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	15	Now as I looked at the living creatures , I saw a wheel on the ground by each of the living creatures with its four faces .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	16	The wheels and the way they were made were like this : They looked like sparkling chrysolite . All four of them looked the same , like one wheel crossways inside another wheel .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	17	When they moved , they went in any one of the four directions , without turning as they went .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	18	The rims of the wheels were high and frightening and were full of eyes all around .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	19	When the living creatures moved , the wheels moved beside them . When the living creatures were lifted up from the ground , the wheels also were lifted up .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	20	Wherever the spirit would go , the living creatures would go . And the wheels were lifted up beside them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	21	When the living creatures moved , the wheels moved . When the living creatures stopped , the wheels stopped . And when the living creatures were lifted from the ground , the wheels were lifted beside them , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	22	Now , over the heads of the living creatures was something like a dome that sparkled like ice and was frightening .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the dome the wings of the living creatures were stretched out straight toward one another . Each living creature also had two wings covering its body .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	24	I heard the sound of their wings , like the roaring sound of the sea , as they moved . It was like the voice of God Almighty , a roaring sound like a noisy army . When the living creatures stopped , they lowered their wings .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	25	A voice came from above the dome over the heads of the living creatures . When the living creatures stopped , they lowered their wings .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	26	Now above the dome there was something that looked like a throne . It looked like a sapphire gem . And on the throne was a shape like a human .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	27	Then I noticed that from the waist up the shape looked like glowing metal with fire inside . From the waist down it looked like fire , and a bright light was all around .
NCV	Ezekiel	1	28	The surrounding glow looked like the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day . It seemed to look like the glory of the Lord . So when I saw it , I bowed facedown on the ground and heard a voice speaking . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	2	2	While he spoke to me , the Spirit entered me and put me on my feet . Then I heard the Lord speaking to me .
NCV	Ezekiel	2	3	He said , “ Human , I am sending you to the people of Israel . That nation has turned against me and broken away from me . They and their ancestors have sinned against me until this very day .
NCV	Ezekiel	2	4	I am sending you to people who are stubborn and who do not obey . You will say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	2	5	They may listen , or they may not , since they are a people who have turned against me . But they will know that a prophet has been among them .
NCV	Ezekiel	2	6	You , human , don ’ t be afraid of the people or their words . Even though they may be like thorny branches and stickers all around you , and though you may feel like you live with poisonous insects , don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t be afraid of their words or their looks , because they are a people who turn against me .
NCV	Ezekiel	2	7	But speak my words to them . They may listen , or they may not , because they turn against me .
NCV	Ezekiel	2	8	But you , human , listen to what I say to you . Don ’ t turn against me as those people do . Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	2	9	Then I looked and saw a hand stretched out to me , and a scroll was in it .
NCV	Ezekiel	2	10	He opened the scroll in front of me . Funeral songs , sad writings , and words about troubles were written on the front and back . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ezekiel	2	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	3	He said to me , “ Human , eat this scroll which I am giving you , and fill your stomach with it. ” Then I ate it , and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and he gave me the scroll to eat .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	4	Then he said to me , “ Human , go to the people of Israel , and speak my words to them .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	5	You are not being sent to people whose speech you can ’ t understand , whose language is difficult . You are being sent to Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	6	You are not being sent to many nations whose speech you can ’ t understand , whose language is difficult , whose words you can not understand . If I had sent you to them , they would have listened to you .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	7	But the people of Israel will not be willing to listen to you , because they are not willing to listen to me . Yes , all the people of Israel are stubborn and will not obey .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	8	See , I now make you as stubborn and as hard as they are .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	9	I am making you as hard as a diamond , harder than stone . Don ’ t be afraid of them or be frightened by them , though they are a people who turn against me. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	3	10	Also , he said to me , “ Human , believe all the words I will speak to you , and listen carefully to them .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	11	Then go to the captives , your own people , and say to them , ‘ The Lord God says this. ’ Tell them this whether they listen or not. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me , saying , “ Praise the glory of the Lord in heaven. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	3	13	I heard the wings of the living creatures touching each other and the sound of the wheels by them . It was a loud rumbling sound .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away . I was unhappy and angry , and I felt the great power of the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	15	I came to the captives from Judah , who lived by the Kebar River at Tel Abib . I sat there seven days where these people lived , feeling shocked . Israel ’ s Warning
NCV	Ezekiel	3	16	After seven days the Lord spoke his word to me again . He said ,
NCV	Ezekiel	3	17	“ Human , I now make you a watchman for Israel . Any time you hear a word from my mouth , warn them for me .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	18	When I say to the wicked , ‘ You will surely die , ’ you must warn them so they may live . If you don ’ t speak out to warn the wicked to stop their evil ways , they will die in their sin . But I will hold you responsible for their death .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	19	If you warn the wicked and they do not turn from their wickedness or their evil ways , they will die because of their sin . But you will have saved your life .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	20	“ Again , those who do right may turn away from doing good and do evil . If I make something bad happen to them , they will die . Because you have not warned them , they will die because of their sin , and the good they did will not be remembered . But I will hold you responsible for their deaths .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	21	But if you have warned those good people not to sin , and they do not sin , they will surely live , because they believed the warning . And you will have saved your life. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	3	22	Then I felt the power of the Lord there . He said to me , “ Get up and go out to the plain . There I will speak to you. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	3	23	So I got up and went out to the plain . I saw the glory of the Lord standing there , like the glory I saw by the Kebar River , and I bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	24	Then the Spirit entered me and made me stand on my feet . He spoke to me and said , “ Go , shut yourself up in your house .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	25	As for you , human , the people will tie you up with ropes so that you will not be able to go out among them .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	26	Also , I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you will be silent . You will not be able to argue with the people , even though they turn against me .
NCV	Ezekiel	3	27	But when I speak to you , I will open your mouth , and you will say to them , ‘ The Lord God says this. ’ Those who will listen , let them listen . Those who refuse , let them refuse , because they are a people who turn against me . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	4	4	“ Then lie down on your left side , and take the guilt of Israel on yourself . Their guilt will be on you for the number of days you lie on your left side .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	2	Then surround it with an army . Build battle works against the city and a dirt road to the top of the city walls . Set up camps around it , and put heavy logs in place to break down the walls .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	3	Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up like an iron wall between you and the city . Turn your face toward the city as if to attack it and then attack . This is a sign to Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	5	I have given you the same number of days as the years of the people ’ s sin . So you will have the guilt of Israel ’ s sin on you for three hundred ninety days .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	6	“ After you have finished these three hundred ninety days , lie down a second time , on your right side . You will then have the guilt of Judah on you . I will give it to you for forty days , a day for each year of their sin .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	7	Then you will look toward Jerusalem , which is being attacked . With your arm bare , you will prophesy against Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	8	I will put ropes on you so you can not turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your attack on Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	9	“ Take wheat , barley , beans , small peas , and millet seeds , and put them in one bowl , and make them into bread for yourself . You will eat it the three hundred ninety days you lie on your side .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	10	You will eat eight ounces of food every day at set times .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	11	You will drink about two-thirds of a quart of water every day at set times .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	12	Eat your food as you would eat a barley cake , baking it over human dung where the people can see. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	4	13	Then the Lord said , “ In the same way Israel will eat unclean food among the nations where I force them to go. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	4	14	But I said , “ No , Lord God ! I have never been made unclean . From the time I was young until now I ’ ve never eaten anything that died by itself or was torn by animals . Unclean meat has never entered my mouth. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	4	15	“ Very well , ” he said . “ Then I will give you cow ’ s dung instead of human dung to use for your fire to bake your bread. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	4	16	He also said to me , “ Human , I am going to cut off the supply of bread to Jerusalem . They will eat the bread that is measured out to them , and they will worry as they eat . They will drink water that is measured out to them , and they will be in shock as they drink it .
NCV	Ezekiel	4	17	This is because bread and water will be hard to find . The people will be shocked at the sight of each other , and they will become weak because of their sin . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	5	5	“ This is what the Lord God says : This is Jerusalem . I have put her at the center of the nations with countries all around her .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	2	Burn one-third with fire in the middle of the city when the days of the attack on Jerusalem are over . Then take one-third and cut it up with the knife all around the city . And scatter one-third to the wind . This is how I will chase them with a sword .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	3	Also take a few of these hairs and tie them in the folds of your clothes .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	4	Take a few more and throw them into the fire and burn them up . From there a fire will spread to all the people of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	6	But she has refused to obey my laws and has been more evil than the nations . She has refused to obey my rules , even more than nations around her . The people of Jerusalem have rejected my laws and have not lived by my rules .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	7	“ So this is what the Lord God says : You have caused more trouble than the nations around you . You have not followed my rules or obeyed my laws . You have not even obeyed the laws of the nations around you .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	8	“ So this is what the Lord God says : I myself am against you , and I will punish you as the nations watch .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	9	I will do things among you that I have not done before and that I will never do anything like again , because you do the things I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	10	So parents among you will eat their children , and children will eat their parents . I will punish you and will scatter to the winds all who are left alive .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	11	So the Lord God says : You have made my Temple unclean with all your evil idols and the hateful things you do . Because of this , as surely as I live , I will cut you off . I will have no pity , and I will show no mercy .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	12	A third of you will die by disease or be destroyed by hunger inside your walls . A third will fall dead by the sword outside your walls . And a third I will scatter in every direction as I chase them with a sword .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	13	Then my anger will come to an end . I will use it up against them , and then I will be satisfied . Then they will know that I , the Lord , have spoken . After I have carried out my anger against them , they will know how strongly I felt .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	14	“ I will make you a ruin and a shame among the nations around you , to be seen by all who pass by .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	15	Then the nations around you will shame you and make fun of you . You will be a warning and a terror to them . This will happen when I punish you in my great anger . I , the Lord , have spoken .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	16	I will send a time of hunger to destroy you , and then I will make your hunger get even worse , and I will cut off your supply of food .
NCV	Ezekiel	5	17	I will send a time of hunger and wild animals against you , and they will kill your children . Disease and death will sweep through your people , and I will bring the sword against you to kill you . I , the Lord , have spoken. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	6	6	In all the places you live , cities will become empty . The places of idol worship will be ruined ; your altars will become lonely ruins . Your idols will be broken and brought to an end . Your incense altars will be cut down , and the things you made will be wiped out .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	2	“ Human , look toward the mountains of Israel , and prophesy against them .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	3	Say , ‘ Mountains of Israel , listen to the word of the Lord God . The Lord God says this to the mountains , the hills , the ravines , and the valleys : I will bring a sword against you , and I will destroy your places of idol worship .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	4	Your altars will be destroyed and your incense altars broken down . Your people will be killed in front of your idols .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	5	I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols , and I will scatter your bones around your altars .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	7	Your people will be killed and fall among you . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	8	“ ‘ But I will leave some people alive ; some will not be killed by the nations when you are scattered among the foreign lands .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	9	Then those who have escaped will remember me , as they live among the nations where they have been taken as captives . They will remember how I was hurt because they were unfaithful to me and turned away from me and desired to worship their idols . They will hate themselves because of the evil things they did that I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	10	Then they will know that I am the Lord . I did not bring this terrible thing on them for no reason .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	11	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Clap your hands , stamp your feet , and groan because of all the hateful , evil things the people of Israel have done . They will die by war , hunger , and disease .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	12	The person who is far away will die by disease . The one who is nearby will die in war . The person who is still alive and has escaped these will die from hunger . So I will carry out my anger on them .
NCV	Ezekiel	6	13	Their people will lie dead among their idols around the altars , on every high hill , on all the mountain tops , and under every green tree and leafy oak—all the places where they offered sweet-smelling incense to their idols . Then you will know that I am the Lord .

NCV	Ezekiel	7	7	Disaster has come for you who live in the land ! The time has come ; the day of confusion is near . There will be no happy shouting on the mountains .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	2	“ Human , the Lord God says this to the land of Israel : An end ! The end has come on the four corners of the land .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	3	Now the end has come for you , and I will send my anger against you . I will judge you for the way you have lived , and I will make you pay for all your actions that I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	4	I will have no pity on you ; I will not hold back punishment from you . Instead , I will make you pay for the way you have lived and for your actions that I hate . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	5	“ This is what the Lord God says : Disaster on top of disaster is coming .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	6	The end has come ! The end has come ! It has stirred itself up against you ! Look ! It has come !
NCV	Ezekiel	7	8	Soon I will pour out my anger against you ; I will carry out my anger against you . I will judge you for the way you have lived and will make you pay for everything you have done that I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	9	I will show no pity , and I will not hold back punishment . I will pay you back for the way you have lived and the things you have done that I hate . Then you will know that I am the Lord who punishes .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	10	“ Look , the day is here . It has come . Disaster has come , violence has grown , and there is more pride than ever .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	11	Violence has grown into a weapon for punishing wickedness . None of the people will be left—none of that crowd , none of their wealth , and nothing of value .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	12	The time has come ; the day has arrived . Don ’ t let the buyer be happy or the seller be sad , because my burning anger is against the whole crowd .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	13	Sellers will not return to the land they have sold as long as they live , because the vision against all that crowd will not be changed . Because of their sins , they will not save their lives .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	14	They have blown the trumpet , and everything is ready . But no one is going to the battle , because my anger is against all that crowd .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	15	“ The sword is outside , and disease and hunger are inside . Whoever is in the field will die by the sword . Hunger and disease will destroy those in the city .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	16	Those who are left alive and who escape will be on the mountains , moaning like doves of the valleys about their own sin .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	17	All hands will hang weakly with fear , and all knees will become weak as water .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	18	They will put on rough cloth to show how sad they are . They will tremble all over with fear . Their faces will show their shame , and all their heads will be shaved .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	19	The people will throw their silver into the streets , and their gold will be like trash . Their silver and gold will not save them from the Lord ’ s anger . It will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs , because it caused them to fall into sin .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	20	They were proud of their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their idols and their evil statues , which I hate . So I will turn their wealth into trash .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	21	I will give it to foreigners as loot from war and to the most evil people in the world as treasure , and they will dishonor it .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	22	I will also turn away from the people of Israel , and they will dishonor my treasured place . Then robbers will enter and dishonor it .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	23	“ Make chains for captives , because the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	24	So I will bring the worst of the nations to take over the people ’ s houses . I will also end the pride of the strong , and their holy places will be dishonored .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	25	When the people are suffering greatly , they will look for peace , but there will be none .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	26	Disaster will come on top of disaster , and rumor will be added to rumor . Then they will try to get a vision from a prophet ; the teachings of God from the priest and the advice from the elders will be lost .
NCV	Ezekiel	7	27	The king will cry greatly , the prince will give up hope , and the hands of the people who own land will shake with fear . I will punish them for the way they have lived . The way they have judged others is the way I will judge them . Then they will know that I am the Lord. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	8	8	He said to me , “ Human , dig through the wall. ” So I dug through the wall and saw an entrance .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	2	I looked and saw something that looked like a human . From the waist down it looked like fire , and from the waist up it looked like bright glowing metal .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	3	It stretched out the shape of a hand and caught me by the hair on my head . The Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky . He took me in visions of God to Jerusalem , to the entrance to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple . In the courtyard was the idol that caused God to be jealous .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	4	I saw the glory of the God of Israel there , as I had seen on the plain .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	5	Then he said to me , “ Human , now look toward the north. ” So I looked up toward the north , and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar was the idol that caused God to be jealous .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	6	He said to me , “ Human , do you see what they are doing ? Do you see how many hateful things the people of Israel are doing here that drive me far away from my Temple ? But you will see things more hateful than these. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	8	7	Then he brought me to the entry of the courtyard . When I looked , I saw a hole in the wall .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	9	Then he said to me , “ Go in and see the hateful , evil things they are doing here. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	8	10	So I entered and looked , and I saw every kind of crawling thing and hateful beast and all the idols of the people of Israel , carved on the wall all around .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	11	Standing in front of these carvings and idols were seventy of the elders of Israel and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan . Each man had his pan for burning incense in his hand , and a sweet-smelling cloud of incense was rising .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	12	Then he said to me , “ Human , have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the dark ? Have you seen each man in the room of his own idol ? They say , ‘ The Lord doesn ’ t see us . The Lord has left the land. ’ ”
NCV	Ezekiel	8	13	He also said to me , “ You will see even more hateful things that they are doing. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	8	14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple of the Lord , where I saw women sitting and crying for Tammuz . [ a ]
NCV	Ezekiel	8	15	He said to me , “ Do you see , human ? You will see things even more hateful than these. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	8	16	Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the Temple . There I saw about twenty-five men at the entrance to the Temple of the Lord , between the porch and the altar . With their backs turned to the Temple of the Lord , they faced east and were worshiping the sun in the east .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	17	He said to me , “ Do you see , human ? Is it unimportant that the people of Judah are doing the hateful things they have done here ? They have filled the land with violence and made me continually angry . Look , they are insulting me every way they can .
NCV	Ezekiel	8	18	So I will act in anger . I will have no pity , nor will I show mercy . Even if they shout in my ears , I won ’ t listen to them. ” Footnotes - 8:14 Tammuz Tammuz was a god in Babylon . Every year people thought this god died when the plants died .

NCV	Ezekiel	9	9	Then he said to me , “ The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is very great . The land is filled with people who murder , and the city is full of people who are not fair . The people say , ‘ The Lord has left the land , and the Lord does not see. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	9	2	Then six men came from the direction of the upper gate , which faces north , each with his powerful weapon in his hand . Among them was a man dressed in linen with a writing case at his side . The men went in and stood by the bronze altar .
NCV	Ezekiel	9	3	Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the creatures with wings , where it had been , to the place in the Temple where the door opened . He called to the man dressed in linen who had the writing case at his side .
NCV	Ezekiel	9	4	He said to the man , “ Go through Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the people who groan and cry about all the hateful things being done among them. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	9	5	As I listened , he said to the other men , “ Go through the city behind the man dressed in linen and kill . Don ’ t pity anyone , and don ’ t show mercy .
NCV	Ezekiel	9	6	Kill and destroy old men , young men and women , little children , and older women , but don ’ t touch any who have the mark on them . Start at my Temple. ” So they started with the elders who were in front of the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	9	7	Then he said to the men , “ Make the Temple unclean , and fill the courtyards with those who have been killed . Go out ! ” So the men went out and killed the people in the city .
NCV	Ezekiel	9	8	While the men were killing the people , I was left alone . I bowed facedown on the ground and I cried out , “ Oh , Lord God ! Will you destroy everyone left alive in Israel when you turn loose your anger on Jerusalem ? ”
NCV	Ezekiel	9	10	But I will have no pity , nor will I show mercy . I will bring their evil back on their heads. ”

NCV	Ezekiel	10	10	All four wheels looked alike : Each looked like a wheel crossways inside another wheel .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	2	The Lord said to the man dressed in linen , “ Go in between the wheels under the living creatures , fill your hands with coals of fire from between the living creatures , and scatter the coals over the city. ” As I watched , the man with linen clothes went in .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	3	Now the living creatures were standing on the south side of the Temple when the man went in . And a cloud filled the inner courtyard .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the glory of the Lord went up from the living creatures and stood over the door of the Temple . The Temple was filled with the cloud , and the courtyard was full of the brightness from the glory of the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	5	The sound of the wings of the living creatures was heard all the way to the outer courtyard . It was like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	6	When the Lord commanded the man dressed in linen , “ Take fire from between the wheels , from between the living creatures , ” the man went in and stood by a wheel .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	7	One living creature put out his hand to the fire that was among them , took some of the fire , and put it in the hands of the man dressed in linen . Then the man took the fire and went out . The Wheels and the Creatures
NCV	Ezekiel	10	8	Something that looked like a human hand could be seen under the wings of the living creatures .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	9	I saw the four wheels by the living creatures , one wheel by each living creature . The wheels looked like shining chrysolite .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	11	When the wheels moved , they went in any of the directions that the four living creatures faced . The wheels did not turn about , and the living creatures did not turn their bodies as they went .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	12	All their bodies , their backs , their hands , their wings , and the wheels were full of eyes all over . Each of the four living creatures had a wheel .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	13	I heard the wheels being called “ whirling wheels. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	10	14	Each living creature had four faces . The first face was the face of a creature with wings . The second face was a human face , the third was the face of a lion , and the fourth was the face of an eagle .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	15	Then the living creatures flew up . They were the same living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	16	When the living creatures moved , the wheels moved beside them . When the living creatures lifted their wings to fly up from the ground , the wheels did not leave their place beside them .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	17	When the living creatures stopped , the wheels stopped . When the creatures went up , the wheels went up also , because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the glory of the Lord left the door of the Temple and stood over the living creatures .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	19	As I watched , the living creatures spread their wings and flew up from the ground , with the wheels beside them . They stood where the east gate of the Temple of the Lord opened , and the glory of the God of Israel was over them .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	20	These were the living creatures I had seen under the God of Israel by the Kebar River . I knew they were called cherubim .
NCV	Ezekiel	10	21	Each one had four faces and four wings , and under their wings were things that looked like human hands .

NCV	Ezekiel	11	5	Then the Spirit of the Lord entered me and told me to say : “ This is what the Lord says : You have said these things , people of Israel , and I know what you are thinking .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	6	You have killed many people in this city , filling its streets with their bodies .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	7	“ So this is what the Lord God says : Those people you have killed and left in the middle of the city are like the best meat , and this city is like the cooking pot . But I will force you out of the city .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	8	You have feared the sword , but I will bring a sword against you , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	9	I will force you out of the city and hand you over to strangers and punish you .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	10	You will die by the sword . I will punish you at the border of Israel so you will know that I am the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	12	Then you will know that I am the Lord . You did not live by my rules or obey my laws . Instead , you did the same things as the nations around you. ”

NCV	Ezekiel	11	14	The Lord spoke his word to me , saying ,
NCV	Ezekiel	11	15	“ Human , the people still in Jerusalem have spoken about your own relatives and all the people of Israel who are captives with you , saying , ‘ They are far from the Lord . This land has been given to us as our property. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	11	16	“ So say , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I sent the people far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries . But for a little while I have become a Temple to them in the countries where they have gone. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	11	17	“ So say : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I will gather you from the nations and bring you together from the countries where you have been scattered . Then I will give you back the land of Israel. ’

NCV	Ezekiel	11	19	I will give them a desire to respect me completely , and I will put inside them a new way of thinking . I will take out the stubborn heart of stone from their bodies , and I will give them an obedient heart of flesh .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	20	Then they will live by my rules and obey my laws and keep them . They will be my people , and I will be their God .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	21	But those who want to serve their evil statues and hateful idols , I will pay back for their evil ways , says the Lord God. ” Ezekiel ’ s Vision Ends
NCV	Ezekiel	11	22	Then the living creatures lifted their wings with the wheels beside them , and the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	23	The glory of the Lord went up from inside Jerusalem and stopped on the mountain on the east side of the city .
NCV	Ezekiel	11	24	The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the captives who had been taken from Judah to Babylonia . This happened in a vision given by the Spirit of God , and then the vision I had seen ended .

NCV	Ezekiel	12	12	The king among them will put his things on his shoulder in the dark and will leave . The people will dig a hole through the wall to bring him out . He will cover his face so he can not see the ground .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	2	“ Human , you are living among a people who refuse to obey . They have eyes to see , but they do not see , and they have ears to hear , but they do not hear , because they are a people who refuse to obey .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	3	“ So , human , pack your things as if you will be taken away captive , and walk away like a captive in the daytime with the people watching . Move from your place to another with the people watching . Maybe they will understand , even though they are a people who refuse to obey .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	4	During the day when the people are watching , bring out the things you would pack as captive . At evening , with the people watching , leave your place like those who are taken away as captives from their country .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig a hole through the wall while they watch , and bring your things out through it .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	6	Lift them onto your shoulders with the people watching , and carry them out in the dark . Cover your face so you can not see the ground , because I have made you a sign to the people of Israel. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	12	7	I did these things as I was commanded . In the daytime I brought what I had packed as if I were being taken away captive . Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands . I brought my things out in the dark and carried them on my shoulders as the people watched .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	8	Then in the morning the Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	12	9	“ Human , didn ’ t Israel , who refuses to obey , ask you , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
NCV	Ezekiel	12	10	“ Say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : This message is about the king in Jerusalem and all the people of Israel who live there. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	12	11	Say , ‘ I am a sign to you. ’ “ The same things I have done will be done to the people in Jerusalem . They will be taken away from their country as captives .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	13	But I will spread my net over him , and he will be caught in my trap . Then I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Babylonians . He will not see that land , but he will die there .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	14	All who are around the king—his helpers and all his army—I will scatter in every direction , and I will chase them with a sword .
NCV	Ezekiel	12	15	“ They will know that I am the Lord when I scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries .

NCV	Ezekiel	16	5	No one felt sorry enough for you to do any of these things for you . No , you were thrown out into the open field , because you were hated on the day you were born .

NCV	Ezekiel	16	18	Then you took your clothes with beautiful needlework and covered the idols . You gave my oil and incense as an offering to them .

NCV	Ezekiel	16	51	Also , Samaria did not do half the sins you do ; you have done more hateful things than they did . So you make your sisters look good because of all the hateful things you have done .
NCV	Ezekiel	16	52	You will suffer disgrace , because you have provided an excuse for your sisters . They are better than you are . Your sins were even more terrible than theirs . Feel ashamed and suffer disgrace , because you made your sisters look good .

NCV	Ezekiel	17	5	“ ‘ The eagle took some seed from the land and planted it in a good field near plenty of water . He planted it to grow like a willow tree .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	6	It sprouted and became a low vine that spread over the ground . The branches turned toward the eagle , but the roots were under the eagle . So the seed became a vine , and its branches grew , sending out leaves .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	7	“ ‘ But there was another giant eagle with big wings and many feathers . The vine then bent its roots toward this eagle . It sent out its branches from the area where it was planted toward the eagle so he could water it .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	8	It had been planted in a good field by plenty of water so it could grow branches and give fruit . It could have become a fine vine. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	17	9	“ Say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : The vine will not continue to grow . The first eagle will pull up the vine ’ s roots and strip off its fruit . Then the vine and all its new leaves will dry up and die . It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull the vine up by its roots .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	10	Even if it is planted again , it will not continue to grow . It will completely dry up and die when the east wind hits it in the area where it grew. ’ ” Zedekiah Against Nebuchadnezzar
NCV	Ezekiel	17	11	Then the Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	17	12	“ Say now to the people who refuse to obey : ‘ Do you know what these things mean ? ’ Say : ‘ The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took the king and important men of Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	13	Then he took a member of the family of the king of Judah and made an agreement with him , forcing him to take an oath . The king also took away the leaders of Judah
NCV	Ezekiel	17	14	to make the kingdom weak so it would not be strong again . Then the kingdom of Judah could continue only by keeping its agreement with the king of Babylon .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	15	But the king of Judah turned against the king of Babylon by sending his messengers to Egypt and asking them for horses and many soldiers . Will the king of Judah succeed ? Will the one who does such things escape ? He can not break the agreement and escape .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	16	“ ‘ As surely as I live , says the Lord God , he will die in Babylon , in the land of the king who made him king of Judah . The king of Judah hated his promise to the king of Babylon and broke his agreement with him .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	18	The king of Judah showed that he hated the promise by breaking the agreement . He promised to support Babylon , but he did all these things . So he will not escape .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	19	“ ‘ So this is what the Lord God says : As surely as I live , this is true : I will pay back the king of Judah for hating my promise and breaking my agreement .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	20	I will spread my net over him , and he will be caught in my trap . Then I will bring him to Babylon , where I will punish him for the unfaithful acts he did against me .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	21	All the best of his soldiers who escape will die by the sword , and those who live will be scattered to every wind . Then you will know that I , the Lord , have spoken .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	22	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I myself will also take a young branch from the top of a cedar tree , and I will plant it . I will cut off a small twig from the top of the tree ’ s young branches , and I will plant it on a very high mountain .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	23	I will plant it on the high mountain of Israel . Then it will grow branches and give fruit and become a great cedar tree . Birds of every kind will build nests in it and live in the shelter of the tree ’ s branches .
NCV	Ezekiel	17	24	Then all the trees in the countryside will know that I am the Lord . I bring down the high tree and make the low tree tall . I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree grow . I am the Lord . I have spoken , and I will do it. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	18	18	But his father took other people ’ s money unfairly and robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people . So he will die for his own sin .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	2	“ What do you mean by using this saying about the land of Israel : ‘ The parents have eaten sour grapes , and that caused the children to grind their teeth from the sour taste ’ ?
NCV	Ezekiel	18	3	“ As surely as I live , says the Lord God , this is true : You will not use this saying in Israel anymore .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	4	Every living thing belongs to me . The life of the parent is mine , and the life of the child is mine . The person who sins is the one who will die .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	5	“ Suppose a person is good and does what is fair and right .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	6	He does not eat at the mountain places of worship . He does not look to the idols of Israel for help . He does not have sexual relations with his neighbor ’ s wife or with a woman during her time of monthly bleeding .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	7	He does not mistreat anyone but returns what was given as a promise for a loan . He does not rob other people . He gives bread to the hungry and clothes to those who have none .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	8	He does not lend money to get too much interest or profit . He keeps his hand from doing wrong . He judges fairly between one person and another .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	9	He lives by my rules and obeys my laws faithfully . Whoever does these things is good and will surely live , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	10	“ But suppose this person has a wild son who murders people and who does any of these other things .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	11	( But the father himself has not done any of these things . ) This son eats at the mountain places of worship . He has sexual relations with his neighbor ’ s wife .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	12	He mistreats the poor and needy . He steals and refuses to return what was promised for a loan . He looks to idols for help . He does things which I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	13	He lends money for too much interest and profit . Will this son live ? No , he will not live ! He has done all these hateful things , so he will surely be put to death . He will be responsible for his own death .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	14	“ Now suppose this son has a son who has seen all his father ’ s sins , but after seeing them does not do those things .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	15	He does not eat at the mountain places of worship . He does not look to the idols of Israel for help . He does not have sexual relations with his neighbor ’ s wife .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	16	He does not mistreat anyone or keep something promised for a loan or steal . He gives bread to the hungry and clothes to those who have none .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	17	He keeps his hand from doing wrong . He does not take too much interest or profit when he lends money . He obeys my laws and lives by my rules . He will not die for his father ’ s sin ; he will surely live .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	19	“ But you ask , ‘ Why is the son not punished for the father ’ s sin ? ’ The son has done what is fair and right . He obeys all my rules , so he will surely live .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	20	The person who sins is the one who will die . A child will not be punished for a parent ’ s sin , and a parent will not be punished for a child ’ s sin . Those who do right will enjoy the results of their own goodness ; evil people will suffer the results of their own evil .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	21	“ But suppose the wicked stop doing all the sins they have done and obey all my rules and do what is fair and right . Then they will surely live ; they will not die .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	22	Their sins will be forgotten . Because they have done what is right , they will live .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	23	I do not really want the wicked to die , says the Lord God . I want them to stop their bad ways and live .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	24	“ But suppose good people stop doing good and do wrong and do the same hateful things the wicked do . Will they live ? All their good acts will be forgotten , because they became unfaithful . They have sinned , so they will die because of their sins .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	25	“ But you say , ‘ What the Lord does isn ’ t fair. ’ Listen , people of Israel . I am fair . It is what you do that is not fair !
NCV	Ezekiel	18	26	When good people stop doing good and do wrong , they will die because of it . They will die , because they did wrong .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	27	When the wicked stop being wicked and do what is fair and right , they will save their lives .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	28	Because they thought about it and stopped doing all the sins they had done , they will surely live ; they will not die .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	29	But the people of Israel still say , ‘ What the Lord does isn ’ t fair. ’ People of Israel , I am fair . It is what you do that is not fair .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	30	“ So I will judge you , people of Israel ; I will judge each of you by what you do , says the Lord God . Change your hearts and stop all your sinning so sin will not bring your ruin .
NCV	Ezekiel	18	31	Get rid of all the sins you have done , and get for yourselves a new heart and a new way of thinking . Why do you want to die , people of Israel ?

NCV	Ezekiel	19	2	Say : ‘ Your mother was like a female lion . She lay down among the young lions . She had many cubs .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	3	When she brought up one of her cubs , he became a strong lion . He learned to tear the animals he hunted , and he ate people .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	4	The nations heard about him . He was trapped in their pit , and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	5	“ ‘ The mother lion waited and saw that there was no hope for her cub . So she took another one of her cubs and made him a strong lion .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	6	This cub roamed among the lions . He was now a strong lion . He learned to tear the animals he hunted , and he ate people .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	7	He tore down their strong places and destroyed their cities . The land and everything in it were terrified by the sound of his roar .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	8	Then the nations came against him from areas all around , and they spread their net over him . He was trapped in their pit .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	9	Then they put him into a cage with chains and brought him to the king of Babylon . They put him into prison so his roar could not be heard again on the mountains of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	10	“ ‘ Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard , planted beside the water . The vine had many branches and gave much fruit , because there was plenty of water .

NCV	Ezekiel	19	12	But it was pulled up by its roots in anger and thrown down to the ground . The east wind dried it up . Its fruit was torn off . Its strong branches were broken off and burned up .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	13	Now the vine is planted in the desert , in a dry and thirsty land .
NCV	Ezekiel	19	14	Fire spread from the vine ’ s main branch , destroying its fruit . There is not a strong branch left on it that could become a scepter for a king. ’ This is a funeral song ; it is to be used as a funeral song. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	20	20	Keep my Sabbaths holy , and they will be a sign between me and you . Then you will know that I am the Lord your God. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	20	2	The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	20	3	“ Human , speak to the elders of Israel and say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Did you come to ask me questions ? As surely as I live , I will not let you ask me questions. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	20	4	“ Will you judge them ? Will you judge them , human ? Let them know the hateful things their ancestors did .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	5	Say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : When I chose Israel , I made a promise to the descendants of Jacob . I made myself known to them in Egypt , and I promised them , “ I am the Lord your God. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	20	6	At that time I promised them I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had found for them , a fertile land , the best land in the world .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	7	I said to them , “ Each one of you must throw away the hateful idols you have seen and liked . Don ’ t make yourselves unclean with the idols of Egypt . I am the Lord your God. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	20	8	“ ‘ But they turned against me and refused to listen to me . They did not throw away the hateful idols which they saw and liked ; they did not give up the idols of Egypt . Then I decided to pour out my anger against them while they were still in Egypt .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	9	But I acted for the sake of my name so it would not be dishonored in full view of the nations where the Israelites lived . I made myself known to the Israelites with a promise to bring them out of Egypt while the nations were watching .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	10	So I took them out of Egypt and brought them into the desert .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	11	I gave them my rules and told them about my laws , by which people will live if they obey them .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	12	I also gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between us so they would know that I am the Lord who made them holy .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	13	“ ‘ But in the desert Israel turned against me . They did not follow my rules , and they rejected my laws , by which people will live if they obey them . They dishonored my Sabbaths . Then I decided to pour out my anger against them and destroy them in the desert .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	14	But I acted for the sake of my name so it would not be dishonored in full view of the nations who watched as I had brought the Israelites out of Egypt .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	15	And in the desert I swore to the Israelites that I would not bring them into the land I had given them . It is a fertile land , the best land in the world .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	16	This was because they rejected my laws and did not follow my rules . They dishonored my Sabbaths and wanted to worship their idols .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	17	But I had pity on them . I did not destroy them or put an end to them in the desert .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	18	I said to their children in the desert , “ Don ’ t live by the rules of your parents , or obey their laws . Don ’ t make yourselves unclean with their idols .

NCV	Ezekiel	20	21	“ ‘ But the children turned against me . They did not live by my rules , nor were they careful to obey my laws , by which people will live if they obey them . They dishonored my Sabbaths . So I decided to pour out my anger against them in the desert .

NCV	Ezekiel	20	23	And in the desert I swore to the Israelites that I would scatter them among the nations and spread them among the countries ,
NCV	Ezekiel	20	24	because they had not obeyed my laws . They had rejected my rules and dishonored my Sabbaths and worshiped the idols of their parents .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	25	I also allowed them to follow rules that were not good and laws by which they could not live .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	26	I let the Israelites make themselves unclean by the gifts they brought to their gods when they sacrificed their first children in the fire . I wanted to terrify them so they would know that I am the Lord. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	20	27	“ So , human , speak to the people of Israel . Say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Your ancestors spoke against me by being unfaithful to me in another way .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	28	When I had brought them into the land I promised to give them , they saw every high hill and every leafy tree . There they offered their sacrifices to gods . They brought offerings that made me angry and burned their incense and poured out their drink offerings .

NCV	Ezekiel	20	32	“ ‘ What you want will not come true . You say , “ We want to be like the other nations , like the people in other lands . We want to worship idols made of wood and stone. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	20	33	As surely as I live , says the Lord God , I will use my great power and strength and anger to rule over you .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	34	I will bring you out from the foreign nations . With my great power and strength and anger I will gather you from the lands where you are scattered .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	35	I will bring you among the nations as I brought your ancestors into the desert with Moses . There I will judge you face to face .

NCV	Ezekiel	20	37	I will count you like sheep and will bring you into line with my agreement .
NCV	Ezekiel	20	38	I will get rid of those who refuse to obey me and who turn against me . I will bring them out of the land where they are now living , but they will never enter the land of Israel . Then you will know that I am the Lord .

NCV	Ezekiel	21	23	The people of Jerusalem have made agreements with other nations to help them fight Babylon . So they will think this prediction is wrong , but it is really proof of their sin , and they will be captured .

NCV	Ezekiel	22	20	People put silver , copper , iron , lead , and tin together inside a furnace to melt them down in a blazing fire . In the same way I will gather you in my hot anger and put you together in Jerusalem and melt you down .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	21	I will put you together and make you feel the heat of my anger . You will be melted down inside Jerusalem .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	23	The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	22	24	“ Human , say to the land , ‘ You are a land that has not had rain or showers when God is angry. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	22	25	Like a roaring lion that tears the animal it has caught , Israel ’ s rulers make evil plans . They have destroyed lives and have taken treasure and valuable things . They have caused many women to become widows .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	26	Israel ’ s priests do cruel things to my teachings and do not honor my holy things . They make no difference between holy and unholy things , and they teach there is no difference between clean and unclean things . They do not remember my Sabbaths , so I am dishonored by them .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	27	Like wolves tearing a dead animal , Jerusalem ’ s leaders have killed people for profit .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	28	And the prophets try to cover this up by false visions and by lying messages . They say , ‘ This is what the Lord God says ’ when the Lord has not spoken .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	29	The people cheat others and steal . They hurt people who are poor and needy . They cheat foreigners and do not treat them fairly .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	30	“ I looked for someone to build up the walls and to stand before me where the walls are broken to defend these people so I would not have to destroy them . But I could not find anyone .
NCV	Ezekiel	22	31	So I let them see my anger . I destroyed them with an anger that was like fire because of all the things they have done , says the Lord God. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	23	23	Men from Babylon and all Babylonia and men from Pekod , Shoa , and Koa will attack you . All the Assyrians will attack you : handsome young captains and lieutenants , all of them important men and all riding horses .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	2	“ Human , a woman had two daughters .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	3	While they were young , they went to Egypt and became prostitutes . They let men touch and hold their breasts .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	4	The older girl was named Oholah , and her sister was named Oholibah . They became my wives and had sons and daughters . Oholah is Samaria , and Oholibah is Jerusalem . [ a ]
NCV	Ezekiel	23	5	“ While still my wife , Samaria had sexual relations with other men . She had great sexual desire for her lovers , men from Assyria . The Assyrians were warriors and
NCV	Ezekiel	23	6	wore blue uniforms . They were all handsome young captains and lieutenants riding on horseback .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	7	Samaria became a prostitute for all the important men in Assyria and made herself unclean with all the idols of everyone she desired .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	8	She continued the prostitution she began in Egypt . When she was young , she had slept with men , and they touched her breasts and had sexual relations with her .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	9	“ So I handed her over to her lovers , the Assyrians , that she wanted so badly .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	10	They stripped her naked and took away her sons and daughters . Then they killed her with a sword . Women everywhere began talking about how she had been punished .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	11	“ Her sister Jerusalem saw what happened , but she became worse than her sister in her sexual desire and prostitution .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	12	She also desired the Assyrians , who were all soldiers in beautiful uniforms—handsome young captains and lieutenants riding horses .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	13	I saw that both girls were alike ; both were prostitutes .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	14	“ But Jerusalem went even further . She saw carvings of Babylonian men on a wall . They wore red
NCV	Ezekiel	23	15	and had belts around their waists and turbans on their heads . They all looked like chariot officers born in Babylonia .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	16	When she saw them , she wanted to have sexual relations with them and sent messengers to them in Babylonia .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	17	So these Babylonian men came and had sexual relations with her and made her unclean . After that , she became sick of them .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	18	But she continued her prostitution so openly that everyone knew about it . And I finally became sick of her , as I had her sister .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	19	But she remembered how she was a young prostitute in Egypt , so she took part in even more prostitution .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	20	She wanted men who behaved like animals in their sexual desire .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	21	In the same way you desired to do the sinful things you had done in Egypt . There men touched and held your young breasts . God ’ s Judgment on Jerusalem
NCV	Ezekiel	23	22	“ So , Jerusalem , this is what the Lord God says : You are tired of your lovers . So now I will make them angry with you and have them attack you from all sides .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	24	Those men will attack with great armies and with their weapons , chariots , and wagons . They will surround you with large and small shields and with helmets . And I will give them the right to punish you , and they will give you their own kind of punishment .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	25	Then you will see how strong my anger can be when they punish you in their anger . They will cut off your noses and ears . They will take away your sons and daughters , and those who are left will be burned .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	26	They will take off your clothes and steal your jewelry .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	27	I will put a stop to the sinful life you began when you were in Egypt so that you will not desire it or remember Egypt anymore .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	28	“ This is what the Lord God says : You became tired of your lovers , but I am going to hand you over to those men you now hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	29	They will treat you with hate and take away everything you worked for , leaving you empty and naked . Everyone will know about the sinful things you did . Your sexual sins
NCV	Ezekiel	23	30	have brought this on you . You have had sexual relations with the nations and made yourselves unclean by worshiping their idols .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	31	You did the same things your sister did , so you will get the same punishment , like a bitter cup to drink .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	32	“ This is what the Lord God says : You will drink the same cup your sister did , and that cup is deep and wide . Everyone will make fun of you , because the cup is full .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	33	It will make you miserable and drunk . It is the cup of fear and ruin . It is the cup of your sister Samaria .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	34	You will drink everything in it , and then you will smash it and tear at your breasts . I have spoken , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	35	“ So this is what the Lord God says : You have forgotten me and turned your back on me . So you will be punished for your sexual sins. ” Judgment on Samaria and Jerusalem
NCV	Ezekiel	23	36	The Lord said to me : “ Human , will you judge Samaria and Jerusalem , showing them their hateful acts ?
NCV	Ezekiel	23	37	They are guilty of adultery and murder . They have taken part in adultery with their idols . They even offered our children as sacrifices in the fire to be food for these idols .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	38	They have also done this to me : They made my Temple unclean at the same time they dishonored my Sabbaths .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	39	They sacrificed their children to their idols . Then they entered my Temple at that very time to dishonor it . That is what they did inside my Temple !
NCV	Ezekiel	23	40	“ They even sent for men from far away , who came after a messenger was sent to them . The two sisters bathed themselves for them , painted their eyes , and put on jewelry .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	41	They sat on a fine bed with a table set before it , on which they put my incense and my oil .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	42	“ There was the noise of a reckless crowd in the city . Common people gathered , and drunkards were brought from the desert . They put bracelets on the wrists of the two sisters and beautiful crowns on their heads .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	43	Then I said about the one who was worn out by her acts of adultery , ‘ Let them continue their sexual sins with her . She is nothing but a prostitute. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	23	44	They kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute . So they continued to go to Samaria and Jerusalem , these shameful women .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	45	But men who do right will punish them as they punish women who take part in adultery and who murder people , because they are guilty of adultery and murder .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	46	“ This is what the Lord God says : Bring together a mob against Samaria and Jerusalem , and hand them over to be frightened and robbed .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	47	Let the mob kill them by throwing stones at them , and let them cut them down with their swords . Let them kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses down .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	48	“ So I will put an end to sexual sins in the land . Then all women will be warned , and they will not do the sexual sins you have done .
NCV	Ezekiel	23	49	You will be punished for your sexual sins and the sin of worshiping idols . Then you will know that I am the Lord God. ” Footnotes - 23:4 Oholah . . .

NCV	Ezekiel	24	24	So Ezekiel is to be an example for you . You must do all the same things he did . When all this happens , you will know that I am the Lord God. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	24	2	“ Human , write down today ’ s date , this very date . The king of Babylon has surrounded Jerusalem this very day .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	3	And tell a story to the people who refuse to obey me . Say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Put on the pot ; put it on and pour water in it .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	4	Put in the pieces of meat , the best pieces—the legs and the shoulders . Fill it with the best bones .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	5	Take the best of the flock , and pile wood under the pot . Boil the pieces of meat until even the bones are cooked .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	6	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : How terrible it will be for the city of murderers ! How terrible it will be for the rusty pot whose rust will not come off ! Take the meat out of it , piece by piece . Don ’ t choose any special piece .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	7	“ ‘ The blood from her killings is still in the city . She poured the blood on the bare rock . She did not pour it on the ground where dust would cover it .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	8	To stir up my anger and revenge , I put the blood she spilled on the bare rock so it will not be covered .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	9	“ ‘ So this is what the Lord God says : How terrible it will be for the city of murderers ! I myself will pile the wood high for burning .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	10	Pile up the wood and light the fire . Finish cooking the meat . Mix in the spices , and let the bones burn .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set the empty pot on the coals so it may become hot and its copper sides glow . The dirty scum stuck inside it may then melt and its rust burn away .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	12	But efforts to clean the pot have failed . Its heavy rust can not be removed , even in the fire .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	13	“ ‘ By your sinful action you have become unclean . I wanted to cleanse you , but you are still unclean . You will never be cleansed from your sin until my anger against you is carried out .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	14	“ ‘ I , the Lord , have spoken . The time has come for me to act . I will not hold back punishment or feel pity or change my mind . I will judge you by your ways and actions , says the Lord God. ’ ” The Death of Ezekiel ’ s Wife
NCV	Ezekiel	24	15	Then the Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	24	16	“ Human , I am going to take your wife from you , the woman you look at with love . She will die suddenly , but you must not be sad or cry loudly for her or shed any tears .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	17	Groan silently ; do not cry loudly for the dead . Tie on your turban , and put your sandals on your feet . Do not cover your face , and do not eat the food people eat when they are sad about a death. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	24	18	So I spoke to the people in the morning , and my wife died in the evening . The next morning I did as I had been commanded .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	19	Then the people asked me , “ Tell us , what do the things you are doing mean for us ? ”
NCV	Ezekiel	24	20	Then I said to them , “ The Lord spoke his word to me . He said ,
NCV	Ezekiel	24	21	‘ Say to the people of Israel , This is what the Lord God says : I am going to dishonor my Temple . You think it gives you strength . You are proud of it , and you look at it with love and tenderness . But your sons and daughters that you left behind in Jerusalem will fall dead by the sword .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	22	When that happens , you are to act as I have : you are not to cover your face , and you are not to eat the food people eat when they are sad about a death .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	23	Your turbans must stay on your heads , and your sandals on your feet . You must not cry loudly , but you must rot away in your sins and groan to each other .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	25	“ And as for you , human , this is how it will be . I will take away the Temple that gives them strength and joy , that makes them proud . They look at it with love , and it makes them happy . And I will take away their sons and daughters also .
NCV	Ezekiel	24	26	At that time a person who escapes will come to you with information for you to hear .

NCV	Ezekiel	25	4	So I am going to give you to the people of the East to be theirs . They will set up their camps among you and make their homes among you . They will eat your fruit and drink your milk .
NCV	Ezekiel	25	5	I will make the city of Rabbah a pasture for camels and the land of Ammon a resting place for sheep . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	25	6	This is what the Lord God says : You have clapped your hands and stamped your feet ; you have laughed about all the insults you made against the land of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	25	7	So I will use my power against you . I will give you to the nations as if you were treasures taken in war . I will wipe you out of the lands so you will no longer be a nation , and I will destroy you . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ’ Prophecy Against Moab and Edom
NCV	Ezekiel	25	8	“ This is what the Lord God says : ‘ Moab and Edom say , “ The people of Judah are like all the other nations. ”

NCV	Ezekiel	25	10	Then I will give Moab , along with the Ammonites , to the people of the East as their possession . Then , along with the Ammonites , Moab will not be a nation anymore .
NCV	Ezekiel	25	11	So I will punish the people of Moab , and they will know that I am the Lord. ’ Prophecy Against Edom
NCV	Ezekiel	25	12	“ This is what the Lord God says : ‘ Edom took revenge on the people of Judah , and the Edomites became guilty because of it .

NCV	Ezekiel	26	8	He will fight a battle and destroy your villages on the shore across from the island . He will set up devices to attack you . He will build a road of earth to the top of the walls . He will raise his shields against you .

NCV	Ezekiel	28	14	I appointed a living creature to guard you . I put you on the holy mountain of God . You walked among the gems that shined like fire .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	15	Your life was right and good from the day you were created , until evil was found in you .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	16	Because you traded with countries far away , you learned to be cruel , and you sinned . So I threw you down in disgrace from the mountain of God . And the living creature who guarded you forced you out from among the gems that shined like fire .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	17	You became too proud because of your beauty . You ruined your wisdom because of your greatness . I threw you down to the ground . Your example taught a lesson to other kings .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	18	You dishonored your places of worship through your many sins and dishonest trade . So I set on fire the place where you lived , and the fire burned you up . I turned you into ashes on the ground for all those watching to see .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	19	All the nations who knew you are shocked about you . Your punishment was so terrible , and you are gone forever. ’ ” Prophecy Against Sidon
NCV	Ezekiel	28	20	The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :

NCV	Ezekiel	28	23	I will send diseases to Sidon , and blood will flow in her streets . Those who are wounded in Sidon will fall dead , attacked from all sides . Then they will know that I am the Lord . God Will Help Israel
NCV	Ezekiel	28	24	“ ‘ No more will neighboring nations be like thorny branches or sharp stickers to hurt Israel . Then they will know that I am the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	25	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I will gather the people of Israel from the nations where they are scattered . I will show my holiness when the nations see what I do for my people . Then they will live in their own land—the land I gave to my servant Jacob .
NCV	Ezekiel	28	26	They will live safely in the land and will build houses and plant vineyards . They will live in safety after I have punished all the nations around who hate them . Then they will know that I am the Lord their God. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	29	29	It was the tenth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , on the twelfth day of the month . The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	29	2	“ Human , look toward the king of Egypt , and prophesy against him and all Egypt .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	3	Say : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I am against you , king of Egypt . You are like a great crocodile that lies in the Nile River . You say , “ The Nile is mine ; I made it for myself. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	29	4	But I will put hooks in your jaws , and I will make the fish of the Nile stick to your sides . I will pull you up out of your rivers , with all the fish sticking to your sides .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	5	I will leave you in the desert , you and all the fish from your rivers . You will fall onto the ground ; you will not be picked up or buried . I have given you to the wild animals and to the birds of the sky for food .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	6	Then all the people who live in Egypt will know that I am the Lord . “ ‘ Israel tried to lean on you for help , but you were like a crutch made out of a weak stalk of grass .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	7	When their hands grabbed you , you splintered and tore open their shoulders . When they leaned on you , you broke and made all their backs twist .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	8	“ ‘ So this is what the Lord God says : I will cause an enemy to attack you and kill your people and animals .

NCV	Ezekiel	29	10	I am against you and your rivers . I will destroy the land of Egypt and make it an empty desert from Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south , all the way to the border of Cush .

NCV	Ezekiel	29	12	I will make the land of Egypt the most deserted country of all . Her cities will be the most deserted of all ruined cities for forty years . I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , spreading them among the countries .

NCV	Ezekiel	29	15	It will be the weakest kingdom , and it will never again rule other nations . I will make it so weak it will never again rule over the nations .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	16	The Israelites will never again depend on Egypt . Instead , Egypt ’ s punishment will remind the Israelites of their sin in turning to Egypt for help . Then they will know that I am the Lord God. ’ ” Egypt Is Given to Babylon
NCV	Ezekiel	29	17	It was the twenty-seventh year of our captivity , in the first month , on the first day of the month . The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	29	18	“ Human , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army fight hard against Tyre . Every soldier ’ s head was rubbed bare , and every shoulder was rubbed raw . But Nebuchadnezzar and his army gained nothing from fighting Tyre .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	19	So this is what the Lord God says : I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon . He will take away Egypt ’ s people and its wealth and its treasures as pay for his army .
NCV	Ezekiel	29	20	I am giving Nebuchadnezzar the land of Egypt as a reward for working hard for me , says the Lord God .

NCV	Ezekiel	30	4	An enemy will attack Egypt , and Cush will tremble with fear . When the killing begins in Egypt , her wealth will be taken away , and her foundations will be torn down .

NCV	Ezekiel	31	31	It was in the eleventh year of our captivity , in the third month , on the first day of the month . The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	31	2	“ Human , say to the king of Egypt and his people : ‘ No one is like you in your greatness .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	3	Assyria was once like a cedar tree in Lebanon with beautiful branches that shaded the forest . It was very tall ; its top was among the clouds .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	4	Much water made the tree grow ; the deep springs made it tall . Rivers flowed around the bottom of the tree and sent their streams to all other trees in the countryside .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	5	So the tree was taller than all the other trees in the countryside . Its limbs became long and big because of so much water .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	6	All the birds of the sky made their nests in the tree ’ s limbs . And all the wild animals gave birth under its branches . All great nations lived in the tree ’ s shade .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	7	So the tree was great and beautiful , with its long branches , because its roots reached down to much water .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedar trees in the garden of God were not as great as it was . The pine trees did not have such great limbs . The plane trees did not have such branches . No tree in the garden of God was as beautiful as this tree .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	9	I made it beautiful with many branches , and all the trees of Eden in the garden of God wanted to be like it .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	10	“ ‘ So this is what the Lord God says : The tree grew tall . Its top reached the clouds , and it became proud of its height .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	11	So I handed it over to a mighty ruler of the nations for him to punish it . Because it was evil , I got rid of it .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	12	The cruelest foreign nation cut it down and left it . The tree ’ s branches fell on the mountains and in all the valleys , and its broken limbs were in all the ravines of the land . All the nations of the earth left the shade of that tree .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	13	The birds of the sky live on the fallen tree . The wild animals live among the tree ’ s fallen branches .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	14	So the trees that grow by the water will not be proud to be tall ; they will not put their tops among the clouds . None of the trees that are watered well will grow that tall , because they all are meant to die and go under the ground . They will be with people who have died and have gone down to the place of the dead .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	15	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : On the day when the tree went down to the place of the dead , I made the deep springs cry loudly . I covered them and held back their rivers , and the great waters stopped flowing . I dressed Lebanon in black to show her sadness about the great tree , and all the trees in the countryside were sad about it .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	16	I made the nations shake with fear at the sound of the tree falling when I brought it down to the place of the dead . It went to join those who have gone down to the grave . Then all the trees of Eden and the best trees of Lebanon , all the well-watered trees , were comforted in the place of the dead below the earth .
NCV	Ezekiel	31	17	These trees had also gone down with the great tree to the place of the dead . They joined those who were killed in war and those among the nations who had lived under the great tree ’ s shade .

NCV	Ezekiel	33	2	“ Human , speak to your people and say to them : ‘ Suppose I bring a war against a land . The people of the land may choose one of their men and make him their watchman .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	3	When he sees the enemy coming to attack the land , he will blow the trumpet and warn the people .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	4	If they hear the sound of the trumpet but do nothing , the enemy will come and kill them . They will be responsible for their own deaths .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	5	They heard the sound of the trumpet but didn ’ t do anything . So they are to blame for their own deaths . If they had done something , they would have saved their own lives .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman sees the enemy coming to attack and does not blow the trumpet , the people will not be warned . Then if the enemy comes and kills any of them , they have died because of their own sin . But I will punish the watchman for their deaths. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	7	“ You , human , are the one I have made a watchman for Israel . If you hear a word from my mouth , you must warn them for me .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	8	Suppose I say to the wicked : ‘ Wicked people , you will surely die , ’ but you don ’ t speak to warn the wicked to stop doing evil . Then they will die because they were sinners , but I will punish you for their deaths .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	9	But if you warn the wicked to stop doing evil and they do not stop , they will die because they were sinners . But you have saved your life .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	10	“ So you , human , say to Israel : ‘ You have said : Surely our law-breaking and sins are hurting us . They will kill us . What can we do so we will live ? ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	11	Say to them : ‘ The Lord God says : As surely as I live , I do not want any who are wicked to die . I want them to stop doing evil and live . Stop ! Stop your wicked ways ! You don ’ t want to die , do you , people of Israel ? ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	12	“ Human , say to your people : ‘ The goodness of those who do right will not save them when they sin . The evil of wicked people will not cause them to be punished if they stop doing it . If good people sin , they will not be able to live by the good they did earlier. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	13	If I tell good people , ‘ You will surely live , ’ they might think they have done enough good and then do evil . Then none of the good things they did will be remembered . They will die because of the evil they have done .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	14	Or , if I say to the wicked people , ‘ You will surely die , ’ they may stop sinning and do what is right and honest .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	15	For example , they may return what somebody gave them as a promise to repay a loan , or pay back what they stole . If they live by the rules that give life and do not sin , then they will surely live , and they will not die .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	16	They will not be punished for any of their sins . They now do what is right and fair , so they will surely live .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	17	“ Your people say : ‘ The way of the Lord is not fair. ’ But it is their own ways that are not fair .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	18	When the good people stop doing good and do evil , they will die for their evil .

NCV	Ezekiel	33	21	It was in the twelfth year of our captivity , on the fifth day of the tenth month . A person who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said , “ Jerusalem has been captured. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	33	22	Now I had felt the power of the Lord on me the evening before . He had made me able to talk again before this person came to me . I could speak ; I was not without speech anymore .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	23	Then the Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	33	24	“ Human , people who live in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying : ‘ Abraham was only one person , yet he was given the land as his own . Surely the land has been given to us , who are many , as our very own. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	25	So say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : You eat meat with the blood still in it , you ask your idols for help , and you murder people . Should you then have the land as your very own ?
NCV	Ezekiel	33	26	You depend on your sword and do terrible things which I hate . Each of you has sexual relations with his neighbor ’ s wife . So should you have the land ? ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	27	“ Say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : As surely as I live , those who are among the city ruins in Israel will be killed in war . I will cause those who live in the country to be eaten by wild animals . People hiding in the strongholds and caves will die of disease .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	28	I will make the land an empty desert . The people ’ s pride in the land ’ s power will end . The mountains of Israel will become empty so that no one will pass through them .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	29	They will know that I am the Lord when I make the land an empty desert because of the things they have done that I hate. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	30	“ But as for you , human , your people are talking about you by the walls and in the doorways of houses . They say to each other : ‘ Come now , and hear the message from the Lord. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	33	31	So they come to you in crowds as if they were really ready to listen . They sit in front of you as if they were my people and hear your words , but they will not obey them . With their mouths they tell me they love me , but their hearts desire their selfish profits .
NCV	Ezekiel	33	32	To your people you are nothing more than a singer who sings love songs and has a beautiful voice and plays a musical instrument well . They hear your words , but they will not obey them .

NCV	Ezekiel	34	34	The Lord spoke his word to me , saying :
NCV	Ezekiel	34	2	“ Human , prophesy against the leaders of Israel , who are like shepherds . Prophesy and say to them : ‘ This is what the Lord God says : How terrible it will be for the shepherds of Israel who feed only themselves ! Why don ’ t the shepherds feed the flock ?
NCV	Ezekiel	34	3	You eat the milk curds , and you clothe yourselves with the wool . You kill the fat sheep , but you do not feed the flock .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	4	You have not made the weak strong . You have not healed the sick or put bandages on those that were hurt . You have not brought back those who strayed away or searched for the lost . But you have ruled the sheep with cruel force .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	5	The sheep were scattered , because there was no shepherd , and they became food for every wild animal .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	6	My flock wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill . They were scattered all over the face of the earth , and no one searched or looked for them .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	7	“ ‘ So , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord . This is what the Lord God says :
NCV	Ezekiel	34	8	As surely as I live , my flock has been caught and eaten by all the wild animals , because the flock has no shepherd . The shepherds did not search for my flock . No , they fed themselves instead of my flock .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	9	So , you shepherds , hear the word of the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	10	This is what the Lord God says : I am against the shepherds . I will blame them for what has happened to my sheep and will not let them tend the flock anymore . Then the shepherds will stop feeding themselves , and I will take my flock from their mouths so they will no longer be their food .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	11	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I , myself , will search for my sheep and take care of them .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd takes care of his scattered flock when it is found , I will take care of my sheep . I will save them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	13	I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries . I will bring them to their own land and pasture them on the mountains of Israel , in the ravines , and in all the places where people live in the land .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	14	I will feed them in a good pasture , and they will eat grass on the high mountains of Israel . They will lie down on good ground where they eat grass , and they will eat in rich grassland on the mountains of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	15	I will feed my flock and lead them to rest , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	16	I will search for the lost , bring back those that strayed away , put bandages on those that were hurt , and make the weak strong . But I will destroy those sheep that are fat and strong . I will tend the sheep with fairness .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	17	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : As for you , my flock , I will judge between one sheep and another , between the male sheep and the male goats .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	18	Is it not enough for you to eat grass in the good land ? Must you crush the rest of the grass with your feet ? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water ? Must you make the rest of the water muddy with your feet ?
NCV	Ezekiel	34	19	Must my flock eat what you crush , and must they drink what you make muddy with your feet ?
NCV	Ezekiel	34	20	“ ‘ So this is what the Lord God says to them : I , myself , will judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	21	You push with your side and with your shoulder , and you knock down all the weak sheep with your horns until you have forced them away .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	22	So I will save my flock ; they will not be hurt anymore . I will judge between one sheep and another .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	23	Then I will put over them one shepherd , my servant David . He will feed them and tend them and be their shepherd .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	24	Then I , the Lord , will be their God , and my servant David will be a ruler among them . I , the Lord , have spoken .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	25	“ ‘ I will make an agreement of peace with my sheep and will remove harmful animals from the land . Then the sheep will live safely in the desert and sleep in the woods .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	26	I will bless them and let them live around my hill . I will cause the rains to come when it is time ; there will be showers to bless them .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	27	Also the trees in the countryside will give their fruit , and the land will give its harvest . And the sheep will be safe on their land . Then they will know that I am the Lord when I break the bars of their captivity and save them from the power of those who made them slaves .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	28	They will not be led captive by the nations again . The wild animals will not eat them , but they will live safely , and no one will make them afraid .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	29	I will give them a place famous for its good crops , so they will no longer suffer from hunger in the land . They will not suffer the insults of other nations anymore .
NCV	Ezekiel	34	30	Then they will know that I , the Lord their God , am with them . The nation of Israel will know that they are my people , says the Lord God .

NCV	Ezekiel	36	16	The Lord spoke his word to me again , saying :

NCV	Ezekiel	36	18	So I poured out my anger against them , because they murdered in the land and because they made the land unclean with their idols .
NCV	Ezekiel	36	19	I scattered them among the nations , and they were spread through the countries . I punished them for how they lived and what they did .
NCV	Ezekiel	36	20	They dishonored my holy name in the nations where they went . The nations said about them , ‘ These are the people of the Lord , but they had to leave the land which he gave them. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	36	21	But I had concern for my holy name , which the nation of Israel had dishonored among the nations where they went .

NCV	Ezekiel	37	37	I felt the power of the Lord on me , and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and put me down in the middle of a valley . It was full of bones .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	2	He led me around among the bones , and I saw that there were many bones in the valley and that they were very dry .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	3	Then he asked me , “ Human , can these bones live ? ” I answered , “ Lord God , only you know. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	37	4	He said to me , “ Prophesy to these bones and say to them , ‘ Dry bones , hear the word of the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	5	This is what the Lord God says to the bones : I will cause breath to enter you so you will come to life .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	6	I will put muscles on you and flesh on you and cover you with skin . Then I will put breath in you so you will come to life . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
NCV	Ezekiel	37	7	So I prophesied as I was commanded . While I prophesied , there was a noise and a rattling . The bones came together , bone to bone .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	8	I looked and saw muscles come on the bones , and flesh grew , and skin covered the bones . But there was no breath in them .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	9	Then he said to me , “ Prophesy to the wind . [ a ] Prophesy , human , and say to the wind , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Wind , come from the four winds , and breathe on these people who were killed so they can come back to life. ’ ”
NCV	Ezekiel	37	10	So I prophesied as the Lord commanded me . And the breath came into them , and they came to life and stood on their feet , a very large army .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	11	Then he said to me , “ Human , these bones are like all the people of Israel . They say , ‘ Our bones are dried up , and our hope has gone . We are destroyed. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	37	12	So , prophesy and say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : My people , I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves . Then I will bring you into the land of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	13	My people , you will know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and cause you to come up from them .

NCV	Ezekiel	37	16	“ Human , take a stick and write on it , ‘ For Judah and all the Israelites with him. ’ Then take another stick and write on it , ‘ The stick of Ephraim , for Joseph and all the Israelites with him. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	37	17	Then join them together into one stick so they will be one in your hand .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	18	“ When your people say to you , ‘ Explain to us what you mean by this , ’
NCV	Ezekiel	37	19	say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I will take the stick for Joseph and the tribes of Israel with him , which is in the hand of Ephraim , and I will put it with the stick of Judah . I will make them into one stick , and they will be one in my hand. ’
NCV	Ezekiel	37	20	Hold the sticks on which you wrote these names in your hand so the people can see them .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	21	Say to the people , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : I am going to take the people of Israel from among the nations where they have gone . I will gather them from all around and bring them into their own land .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	22	I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel . One king will rule all of them . They will never again be two nations ; they will not be divided into two kingdoms anymore .
NCV	Ezekiel	37	23	They will not continue to make themselves unclean by their idols , their statues of gods which I hate , or by their sins . I will save them from all the ways they sin and turn against me , and I will make them clean . Then they will be my people , and I will be their God .

NCV	Ezekiel	40	38	There was a room with a door that opened onto the porch of the inner north gateway . In this room the priests washed animals for the burnt offerings .
NCV	Ezekiel	40	39	There were two tables on each side of the porch , on which animals for burnt offerings , sin offerings , and penalty offerings were killed .
NCV	Ezekiel	40	41	So there were four tables inside the gateway , and four tables outside . In all there were eight tables on which the priests killed animals for sacrifices .

NCV	Ezekiel	41	6	The side rooms were on three different stories , each above the other , with thirty rooms on each story . All around the Temple walls there were ledges for the side rooms . The upper rooms rested on the ledges but were not attached to the Temple walls .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	7	The side rooms around the Temple were wider on each higher story , so rooms were wider on the top story . A stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest through the middle story .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	8	I also saw that the Temple had a raised base all around . Its edge was the foundation for the side rooms , and it was ten and one-half feet thick .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	9	The outer wall of the side rooms was about nine feet thick . There was an open area between the side rooms of the Temple
NCV	Ezekiel	41	10	and some other rooms . It was thirty-five feet wide and went all around the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	11	The side rooms had doors which led to the open area around the outside of the Temple . One door faced north , and the other faced south . The open area was about nine feet wide all around .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	12	The building facing the private area at the west side was one hundred twenty-two and one-half feet wide . The wall around the building was about nine feet thick and one hundred fifty-seven and one-half feet long .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	13	Then the man measured the Temple . It was one hundred seventy-five feet long . The private area , including the building and its walls , was in all one hundred seventy-five feet long .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	14	Also the front of the Temple and the private area on its east side were one hundred seventy-five feet wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	41	15	The man measured the length of the building facing the private area on the west side , and it was one hundred seventy-five feet from one wall to the other . The Holy Place , the Most Holy Place , and the outer porch

NCV	Ezekiel	41	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	42	Then the man led me north out into the outer courtyard and to the rooms across from the private area and the building .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	2	These rooms on the north side were one hundred seventy-five feet long and eighty-seven and one-half feet wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	3	There was thirty-five feet of the inner courtyard between them and the Temple . On the other side , they faced the stone pavement of the outer courtyard . The rooms were built in three stories like steps and had balconies .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	4	There was a path on the north side of the rooms , which was seventeen and one-half feet wide and one hundred seventy-five feet long . Doors led into the rooms from this path .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	5	The top rooms were narrower , because the balconies took more space from them . The rooms on the first and second stories of the building were wider .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	6	The rooms were on three stories . They did not have pillars like the pillars of the courtyards . So the top rooms were farther back than those on the first and second stories .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	7	There was a wall outside parallel to the rooms and to the outer courtyard . It ran in front of the rooms for eighty-seven and one-half feet .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	8	The row of rooms along the outer courtyard was eighty-seven and one-half feet long , and the rooms that faced the Temple were about one hundred seventy-five feet long .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	9	The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side so a person could enter them from the outer courtyard ,
NCV	Ezekiel	42	10	at the start of the wall beside the courtyard . There were rooms on the south side , which were across from the private area and the building .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	11	These rooms had a path in front of them . They were like the rooms on the north with the same length and width and the same doors .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	12	The doors of the south rooms were like the doors of the north rooms . There was an entrance at the open end of a path beside the wall , so a person could enter at the east end .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	13	The man said to me , “ The north and south rooms across from the private area are holy rooms . There the priests who go near the Lord will eat the most holy offerings . There they will put the most holy offerings : the grain offerings , sin offerings , and the penalty offerings , because the place is holy .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	14	The priests who enter the Holy Place must leave their serving clothes there before they go into the outer courtyard , because these clothes are holy . After they put on other clothes , they may go to the part of the Temple area which is for the people. ” Outside the Temple Area
NCV	Ezekiel	42	15	When the man finished measuring inside the Temple area , he brought me out through the east gateway . He measured the area all around .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	16	The man measured the east side with the measuring stick ; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured the north side ; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured the south side ; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	19	He went around to the west side ; it measured eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick .
NCV	Ezekiel	42	20	So he measured the Temple area on all four sides . The Temple area had a wall all around it that was eight hundred seventy-five feet long and eight hundred seventy-five feet wide . It separated what was holy from that which was not holy . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	43	43	Then the man led me to the outer east gateway ,
NCV	Ezekiel	43	2	and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east . It sounded like the roar of rushing water , and its brightness made the earth shine .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	3	The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when the Lord came to destroy the city and also like the vision I had seen by the Kebar River . I bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	4	The glory of the Lord came into the Temple area through the east gateway .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	5	Then the Spirit picked me up and brought me into the inner courtyard . There I saw the Lord ’ s glory filling the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	6	As the man stood at my side , I heard someone speaking to me from inside the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	7	The voice from the Temple said to me , “ Human , this is my throne and the place where my feet rest . I will live here among the Israelites forever . The people of Israel will not make my holy name unclean again . Neither the people nor their kings will make it unclean with their sexual sins or with the dead bodies of their kings .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	8	The kings made my name unclean by putting their doorway next to my doorway , and their doorpost next to my doorpost so only a wall separated me from them . When they did their acts that I hate , they made my holy name unclean , and so I destroyed them in my anger .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them stop their sexual sins and take the dead bodies of their kings far away from me . Then I will live among them forever .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	10	“ Human , tell the people of Israel about the Temple so they will be ashamed of their sins . Let them think about the plan of the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	11	If they are ashamed of all they have done , let them know the design of the Temple and how it is built . Show them its exits and entrances , all its designs , and also all its rules and teachings . Write the rules as they watch so they will obey all the teachings and rules about the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	12	This is the teaching about the Temple : All the area around the top of the mountain is most holy . This is the teaching about the Temple . The Altar
NCV	Ezekiel	43	13	“ These are the measurements of the altar , using the measuring stick . The altar ’ s gutter is twenty-one inches high and twenty-one inches wide , and its rim is about nine inches around its edge . And the altar is this tall :
NCV	Ezekiel	43	14	From the ground up to the lower ledge , it measures three and one-half feet . It is twenty-one inches wide . It measures seven feet from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge and is twenty-one inches wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	15	The place where the sacrifice is burned on the altar is seven feet high , with its four corners shaped like horns and reaching up above it .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	16	It is square , twenty-one feet long and twenty-one feet wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	17	The upper ledge is also square , twenty-four and one-half feet long and twenty-four and one-half feet wide . The rim around the altar is ten and one-half inches wide , and its gutter is twenty-one inches wide all around . Its steps are on the east side. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	43	18	Then the man said to me , “ Human , this is what the Lord God says : These are the rules for the altar . When it is built , use these rules to offer burnt offerings and to sprinkle blood on it .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	19	You must give a young bull as a sin offering to the priests , the Levites who are from the family of Zadok and who come near me to serve me , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	20	Take some of the bull ’ s blood and put it on the four corners of the altar , on the four corners of the ledge , and all around the rim . This is how you will make the altar pure and ready for God ’ s service .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	21	Then take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the proper place in the Temple area , outside the Temple building .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	22	“ On the second day offer a male goat that has nothing wrong with it for a sin offering . The priests will make the altar pure and ready for God ’ s service as they did with the young bull .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	23	When you finish making the altar pure and ready , offer a young bull and a male sheep from the flock , which have nothing wrong with them .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	24	You must offer them in the presence of the Lord , and the priests are to throw salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	25	“ You must prepare a goat every day for seven days as a sin offering . Also , the priests must prepare a young bull and male sheep from the flock , which have nothing wrong with them .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	26	For seven days the priests are to make the altar pure and ready for God ’ s service . Then they will give the altar to God .
NCV	Ezekiel	43	27	After these seven days , on the eighth day , the priests must offer your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings on the altar . Then I will accept you , says the Lord God. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Ezekiel	43	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	44	Then the man brought me back to the outer east gateway of the Temple area , but the gate was shut .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	2	The Lord said to me , “ This gate will stay shut ; it will not be opened . No one may enter through it , because the Lord God of Israel has entered through it . So it must stay shut .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	3	Only the ruler himself may sit in the gateway to eat a meal in the presence of the Lord . He must enter through the porch of the gateway and go out the same way. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	44	4	Then the man brought me through the outer north gate to the front of the Temple . As I looked , I saw the glory of the Lord filling the Temple of the Lord , and I bowed facedown on the ground .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	5	The Lord said to me , “ Human , pay attention . Use your eyes to see , and your ears to hear . See and hear everything I tell you about all the rules and teachings of the Temple of the Lord . Pay attention to the entrance to the Temple and to all the exits from the Temple area .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	6	Then speak to those who refuse to obey . Say to the people of Israel , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Stop doing all your acts that I hate , Israel !
NCV	Ezekiel	44	7	You brought foreigners into my Holy Place who were not circumcised in the flesh and had not given themselves to serving me . You dishonored my Temple when you offered me food , fat , and blood . You broke my agreement by all the things you did that I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	8	You did not take care of my holy things yourselves but put foreigners in charge of my Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	9	This is what the Lord God says : Foreigners who are not circumcised in flesh and who do not give themselves to serving me may not enter my Temple . Not even a foreigner living among the people of Israel may enter .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	10	“ ‘ But the Levites who stopped obeying me when Israel left me and who followed their idols must be punished for their sin .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	11	These Levites are to be servants in my Holy Place . They may guard the gates of the Temple and serve in the Temple area . They may kill the animals for the burnt offering and the sacrifices for the people . They may stand before the people to serve them .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	12	But these Levites helped the people worship their idols and caused the people of Israel to fall , so I make this promise : They will be punished for their sin , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	13	They will not come near me to serve as priests , nor will they come near any of my holy things or the most holy offerings . But they will be made ashamed of the things they did that I hate .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	14	I will put them in charge of taking care of the Temple area , all the work that must be done in it .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	15	“ ‘ But the priests who are Levites and descendants of Zadok took care of my Holy Place when Israel left me , so they may come near to serve me . They may stand in my presence to offer me the fat and blood of the animals they sacrifice , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	16	They are the only ones who may enter my Holy Place . Only they may come near my table to serve me and take care of the things I gave them to do .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	17	“ ‘ When they enter the gates of the inner courtyard , they must wear linen robes . They must not wear wool to serve at the gates of the inner courtyard or in the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	18	They will wear linen turbans on their heads and linen underclothes . They will not wear anything that makes them perspire .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	19	When they go out into the outer courtyard to the people , they must take off their serving clothes before they go . They must leave these clothes in the holy rooms and put on other clothes . Then they will not let their holy clothes hurt the people .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	20	“ ‘ They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long but must keep the hair of their heads trimmed .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	21	None of the priests may drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	22	The priests must not marry widows or divorced women . They may marry only virgins from the people of Israel or widows of priests .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	23	They must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is not holy . They must help my people know what is unclean and what is clean .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	24	“ ‘ In court they will act as judges . When they judge , they will follow my teachings . They must obey my laws and my rules at all my special feasts and keep my Sabbaths holy .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	25	“ ‘ They must not go near a dead person , making themselves unclean . But they are allowed to make themselves unclean if the dead person is their father , mother , son , daughter , brother , or a sister who has not married .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	26	After a priest has been made clean again , he must wait seven days .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	27	Then he may go into the inner courtyard to serve in the Temple , but he must offer a sin offering for himself , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	28	“ ‘ These are the rules about the priests and their property : They will have me instead of property . You will not give them any land to own in Israel ; I am what they will own .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	29	They will eat the grain offerings , sin offerings , and penalty offerings . Everything Israel gives to me will be theirs .
NCV	Ezekiel	44	30	The best fruits of all the first harvests and all the special gifts offered to me will belong to the priests . You will also give to the priests the first part of your grain that you grind and so bring a blessing on your family .

NCV	Ezekiel	45	45	“ ‘ When you divide the land for the Israelite tribes by throwing lots , you must give a part of the land to belong to the Lord . It will be about seven miles long and about six miles wide ; all of this land will be holy .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	2	From this land , an area eight hundred seventy-five feet square will be for the Temple . There will be an open space around the Temple that is eighty-seven and one-half feet wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	3	In the holy area you will measure a part about seven miles long and three miles wide , and in it will be the Most Holy Place .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	4	This holy part of the land will be for the priests who serve in the Temple , who come near to the Lord to serve him . It will be a place for the priests ’ houses and for the Temple .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	5	Another area about seven miles long and more than three miles wide will be for the Levites , who serve in the Temple area . It will belong to them so they will have cities in which to live .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	6	“ ‘ You must give the city an area that is about one and one-half miles wide and about seven miles long , along the side of the holy area . It will belong to all the people of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	7	“ ‘ The ruler will have land on both sides of the holy area and the city . On the west of the holy area , his land will reach to the Mediterranean Sea . On the east of the holy area , his land will reach to the eastern border . It will be as long as the land given to each tribe .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	8	Only this land will be the ruler ’ s property in Israel . So my rulers will not be cruel to my people anymore , but they will let each tribe in the nation of Israel have its share of the land .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	9	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : You have gone far enough , you rulers of Israel ! Stop being cruel and hurting people , and do what is right and fair . Stop forcing my people out of their homes , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	10	You must have honest scales , an honest dry measurement and an honest liquid measurement .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	11	The dry measure and the liquid measure will be the same : The liquid measure will always be a tenth of a homer , [ a ] and the ephah will always be a tenth of a homer . The measurement they follow will be the homer .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	12	The shekel [ b ] will be worth twenty gerahs , and a mina will be worth sixty shekels . Offerings and Holy Days
NCV	Ezekiel	45	13	“ ‘ This is the gift you should offer : a sixth of an ephah from every homer of wheat , and a sixth of an ephah from every homer of barley .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	14	The amount of oil you are to offer is a tenth of a bath from each cor . ( Ten baths make a homer and also make a cor . )
NCV	Ezekiel	45	15	You should give one sheep from each flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel . All these are to be offered for the grain offerings , burnt offerings , and fellowship offerings to remove sins so you will belong to God , says the Lord God .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	16	All people in the land will give this special offering to the ruler of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	17	It will be the ruler ’ s responsibility to supply the burnt offerings , grain offerings , and drink offerings . These offerings will be given at the feasts , at the New Moons , on the Sabbaths , and at all the other feasts of Israel . The ruler will supply the sin offerings , grain offerings , and fellowship offerings to pay for the sins of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	18	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : On the first day of the first month take a young bull that has nothing wrong with it . Use it to make the Temple pure and ready for God ’ s service .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	19	The priest will take some of the blood from this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple , on the four corners of the ledge of the altar , and on the posts of the gate to the inner courtyard .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	20	You will do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned by accident or without knowing it . This is how you make the Temple pure and ready for God ’ s service . Passover Feast Offerings
NCV	Ezekiel	45	21	“ ‘ On the fourteenth day of the first month you will celebrate the Feast of Passover . It will be a feast of seven days when you eat bread made without yeast .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	22	On that day the ruler must offer a bull for himself and for all the people of the land as a sin offering .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	23	During the seven days of the feast he must offer seven bulls and seven male sheep that have nothing wrong with them . They will be burnt offerings to the Lord , which the ruler will offer every day of the seven days of the feast . He must also offer a male goat every day as a sin offering .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	24	The ruler must give as a grain offering one-half bushel for each bull and one-half bushel for each sheep . He must give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel .
NCV	Ezekiel	45	25	“ ‘ Beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when you celebrate the Feast of Shelters , the ruler will supply the same things for seven days : the sin offerings , burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the olive oil .

NCV	Ezekiel	46	46	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : The east gate of the inner courtyard will stay shut on the six working days , but it will be opened on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	2	The ruler will enter from outside through the porch of the gateway and stand by the gatepost , while the priests offer the ruler ’ s burnt offering and fellowship offering . The ruler will worship at the entrance of the gateway , and then he will go out . But the gate will not be shut until evening .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	3	The people of the land will worship at the entrance of that gateway in the presence of the Lord on the Sabbaths and New Moons .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	4	This is the burnt offering the ruler will offer to the Lord on the Sabbath day : six male lambs that have nothing wrong with them and a male sheep that has nothing wrong with it .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	5	He must give a half-bushel grain offering with the male sheep , but he may give as much grain offering with the lambs as he pleases . He must also give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	6	On the day of the New Moon he must offer a young bull that has nothing wrong with it . He must also offer six lambs and a male sheep that have nothing wrong with them .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	7	The ruler must give a half-bushel grain offering with the bull and one-half bushel with the male sheep . With the lambs , he may give as much grain as he pleases . But he must give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	8	When the ruler enters , he must go in through the porch of the gateway , and he must go out the same way .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	9	“ ‘ When the people of the land come into the Lord ’ s presence at the special feasts , those who enter through the north gate to worship must go out through the south gate . Those who enter through the south gate must go out through the north gate . They must not return the same way they entered ; everyone must go out the opposite way .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	10	The ruler will go in with the people when they go in and go out with them when they go out .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	11	“ ‘ At the feasts and regular times of worship one-half bushel of grain must be offered with a young bull , and one-half bushel of grain must be offered with a male sheep . But with an offering of lambs , the ruler may give as much grain as he pleases . He should give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	12	The ruler may give an offering as a special gift to the Lord ; it may be a burnt offering or fellowship offering . When he gives it to the Lord , the inner east gate is to be opened for him . He must offer his burnt offering or his fellowship offering as he does on the Sabbath day . Then he will go out , and the gate will be shut after he has left .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	13	“ ‘ Every day you will give a year-old lamb that has nothing wrong with it for a burnt offering to the Lord . Do it every morning .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	14	Also , you must offer a grain offering with the lamb every morning . For this you will give three and one-third quarts of grain and one and one-third quarts of olive oil , to make the fine flour moist , as a grain offering to the Lord . This is a rule that must be kept from now on .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	15	So you must always give the lamb , together with the grain offering and the olive oil , every morning as a burnt offering . Rules for the Ruler
NCV	Ezekiel	46	16	“ ‘ This is what the Lord God says : If the ruler gives a gift from his land to any of his sons , that land will belong to the son and then to the son ’ s children . It is their property passed down from their family .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	17	But if the ruler gives a gift from his land to any of his servants , that land will belong to the servant only until the year of freedom . Then the land will go back to the ruler . Only the ruler ’ s sons may keep a gift of land from the ruler .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	18	The ruler must not take any of the people ’ s land , forcing them out of their land . He must give his sons some of his own land so my people will not be scattered out of their own land. ’ ” The Special Kitchens
NCV	Ezekiel	46	19	The man led me through the entrance at the side of the gateway to the priests ’ holy rooms that face north . There I saw a place at the west end .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	20	The man said to me , “ This is where the priests will boil the meat of the penalty offering and sin offering and bake the grain offering . Then they will not need to bring these holy offerings into the outer courtyard , because that would hurt the people. ”
NCV	Ezekiel	46	21	Then the man brought me out into the outer courtyard and led me to its four corners . In each corner of the courtyard was a smaller courtyard .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	22	Small courtyards were in the four corners of the courtyard . Each small courtyard was the same size , seventy feet long and fifty-two and one-half feet wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	23	A stone wall was around each of the four small courtyards , and places for cooking were built in each of the stone walls .
NCV	Ezekiel	46	24	The man said to me , “ These are the kitchens where those who work in the Temple will boil the sacrifices offered by the people. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Ezekiel	47	47	The man led me back to the door of the Temple , and I saw water coming out from under the doorway and flowing east . ( The Temple faced east . ) The water flowed down from the south side wall of the Temple and then south of the altar .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	2	The man brought me out through the outer north gate and led me around outside to the outer east gate . I found the water coming out on the south side of the gate .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	3	The man went toward the east with a line in his hand and measured about one-third of a mile . Then he led me through water that came up to my ankles .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	4	The man measured about one-third of a mile again and led me through water that came up to my knees . Then he measured about one-third of a mile again and led me through water up to my waist .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	5	The man measured about one-third of a mile again , but it was now a river that I could not cross . The water had risen too high ; it was deep enough for swimming ; it was a river that no one could cross .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	6	The man asked me , “ Human , do you see this ? ” Then the man led me back to the bank of the river .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	7	As I went back , I saw many trees on both sides of the river .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	8	The man said to me , “ This water will flow toward the eastern areas and go down into the Jordan Valley . When it enters the Dead Sea , it will become fresh .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	9	Everywhere the river goes , there will be many fish . Wherever this water goes the Dead Sea will become fresh , and so where the river goes there will be many living things .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	10	Fishermen will stand by the Dead Sea . From En Gedi all the way to En Eglaim there will be places to spread fishing nets . There will be many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea , as many as in the Mediterranean Sea .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	11	But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh ; they will be left for salt .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	12	All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both banks of the river , and their leaves will not dry and die . The trees will have fruit every month , because the water for them comes from the Temple . The fruit from the trees will be used for food , and their leaves for medicine. ” Borders of the Land
NCV	Ezekiel	47	13	This is what the Lord God says : “ These are the borders of the land to be divided among the twelve tribes of Israel . Joseph will have two parts of land .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	14	You will divide the land equally . I promised to give it to your ancestors , so this land will belong to you as family property .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	15	“ This will be the border line of the land : “ On the north side it will start at the Mediterranean Sea . It will go through Hethlon , toward Lebo Hamath and on to the towns of Zedad ,
NCV	Ezekiel	47	16	Berothah , and Sibraim on the border between Damascus and Hamath . Then it will go on to the town of Hazer Hatticon on the border of the country of Hauran .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	17	So the border line will go from the Mediterranean Sea east to the town of Hazar Enan , where the land belonging to Damascus and Hamath lies on the north side . This will be the north side of the land .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	18	“ On the east side the border runs south from a point between Hauran and Damascus . It will go along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel and will continue to the town of Tamar on the Dead Sea . This will be the east side of the land .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	19	“ On the south side the border line will go west from Tamar all the way to the waters of Meribah Kadesh . Then it will run along the brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea . This will be the south side of the land .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	20	“ On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border line up to a place across from Lebo Hamath . This will be the west side of your land .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	21	“ You will divide this land among the tribes of Israel .
NCV	Ezekiel	47	22	You will divide it as family property for yourselves and for the foreigners who live and have children among you . You are to treat these foreigners the same as people born in Israel ; they are to share the land with the tribes of Israel .

NCV	Ezekiel	48	48	“ These are the areas of the tribes named here : Dan will have one share at the northern border . It will go from the sea through Hethlon to Lebo Hamath , all the way to Hazar Enan , where Damascus lies to the north . It will stop there next to Hamath . This will be Dan ’ s northern border from the east side to the Mediterranean Sea on the west side .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	2	“ South of Dan ’ s border , Asher will have one share . It will go from the east side to the west side .

NCV	Ezekiel	48	8	“ South of Judah ’ s border will be the holy area which you are to give . It will be about seven miles wide and as long and wide as one of the tribes ’ shares . It will run from the east side to the west side . The Temple will be in the middle of this area .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	9	“ The share which you will give the Lord will be about seven miles long and three miles wide .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	10	The holy area will be divided among these people . The priests will have land about seven miles long on the north and south sides , and three miles wide on the west and east sides . The Temple of the Lord will be in the middle of it .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	11	This land is for the priests who are given the holy duty of serving the Lord . They are the descendants of Zadok who did my work and did not leave me when Israel and the Levites left me .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	12	They will have as their share a very holy part of the holy portion of the land . It will be next to the land of the Levites .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	13	“ Alongside the land for the priests , the Levites will have a share about seven miles long and three miles wide ; its full length will be about seven miles and its full width about three miles .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	14	The Levites are not to sell or trade any of this land . They are not to let anyone else own any of this best part of the land , because it belongs to the Lord . City Property
NCV	Ezekiel	48	15	“ The rest of the area will be about one and one-half miles wide and seven miles long . It will not be holy but will belong to the city and be used for homes and pastures . The city will be in the middle of it .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	16	These are the city ’ s measurements : the north side will be about one mile , the south side about one mile , the east side about one mile , and the west side about one mile .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	17	The city ’ s land for pastures will be about four hundred thirty-seven feet on the north , four hundred thirty-seven feet on the south , four hundred thirty-seven feet on the east , and four hundred thirty-seven feet on the west .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	18	Along the long side of the holy area there will be left three miles on the east and three miles on the west . It will be used to grow food for the city workers .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	19	The city workers from all the tribes of Israel will farm this land .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	20	This whole area will be square , seven miles by seven miles . You shall give to the Lord the holy share along with the city property .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	21	“ Land that is left over on both sides of the holy area and city property will belong to the ruler . That land will extend east of the holy area to the eastern border and west of it to the Mediterranean Sea . Both of these areas run the length of the lands of the tribes , and they belong to the ruler . The holy area with the Holy Place of the Temple will be in the middle .
NCV	Ezekiel	48	22	The Levites ’ land and the city property will be in the middle of the lands belonging to the ruler . Those lands will be between Judah ’ s border and Benjamin ’ s border . The Other Tribes ’ Land

NCV	Daniel	1	1	During the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah , Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and surrounded it with his army .
NCV	Daniel	1	2	The Lord allowed Nebuchadnezzar to capture Jehoiakim king of Judah . Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the things from the Temple of God , which he carried to Babylonia and put in the temple of his gods .
NCV	Daniel	1	3	Then King Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz , his chief officer , to bring some of the men of Judah into his palace . He wanted them to be from important families , including the family of the king of Judah .
NCV	Daniel	1	4	King Nebuchadnezzar wanted only young Israelite men who had nothing wrong with them . They were to be handsome and well educated , capable of learning and understanding , and able to serve in his palace . Ashpenaz was to teach them the language and writings of the Babylonians .
NCV	Daniel	1	5	The king gave the young men a certain amount of food and wine every day , just like the food he ate . The young men were to be trained for three years , and then they would become servants of the king of Babylon .
NCV	Daniel	1	6	Among those young men were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah from the people of Judah .
NCV	Daniel	1	7	Ashpenaz , the chief officer , gave them Babylonian names . Daniel ’ s new name was Belteshazzar , Hananiah ’ s was Shadrach , Mishael ’ s was Meshach , and Azariah ’ s was Abednego .
NCV	Daniel	1	8	Daniel decided not to eat the king ’ s food or drink his wine because that would make him unclean . So he asked Ashpenaz for permission not to make himself unclean in this way .
NCV	Daniel	1	9	God made Ashpenaz , the chief officer , want to be kind and merciful to Daniel ,
NCV	Daniel	1	10	but Ashpenaz said to Daniel , “ I am afraid of my master , the king . He ordered me to give you this food and drink . If you begin to look worse than other young men your age , the king will see this . Then he will cut off my head because of you. ”
NCV	Daniel	1	11	Ashpenaz had ordered a guard to watch Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
NCV	Daniel	1	12	Daniel said to the guard , “ Please give us this test for ten days : Don ’ t give us anything but vegetables to eat and water to drink .
NCV	Daniel	1	13	After ten days compare how we look with how the other young men look who eat the king ’ s food . See for yourself and then decide how you want to treat us , your servants. ”
NCV	Daniel	1	14	So the guard agreed to test them for ten days .
NCV	Daniel	1	15	After ten days they looked healthier and better fed than all the young men who ate the king ’ s food .
NCV	Daniel	1	16	So the guard took away the king ’ s special food and wine , feeding them vegetables instead .
NCV	Daniel	1	17	God gave these four young men wisdom and the ability to learn many things that people had written and studied . Daniel could also understand visions and dreams .
NCV	Daniel	1	18	At the end of the time set for them by the king , Ashpenaz brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar .
NCV	Daniel	1	19	The king talked to them and found that none of the young men were as good as Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . So those four young men became the king ’ s servants .
NCV	Daniel	1	20	Every time the king asked them about something important , they showed much wisdom and understanding . They were ten times better than all the fortune-tellers and magicians in his kingdom !
NCV	Daniel	1	21	So Daniel continued to be the king ’ s servant until the first year Cyrus was king . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Daniel	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Daniel	2	2	So the king called for his fortune-tellers , magicians , wizards , and wise men , because he wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed . They came in and stood in front of the king .
NCV	Daniel	2	3	Then the king said to them , “ I had a dream that bothers me , and I want to know what it means. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	4	The wise men answered the king in the Aramaic language , “ O king , live forever ! Please tell us , your servants , your dream . Then we will tell you what it means. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	5	King Nebuchadnezzar said to them , “ I meant what I said . You must tell me the dream and what it means . If you don ’ t , I will have you torn apart , and I will turn your houses into piles of stones .
NCV	Daniel	2	6	But if you tell me my dream and its meaning , I will reward you with gifts and great honor . So tell me the dream and what it means. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	7	Again the wise men said to the king , “ Tell us , your servants , the dream , and we will tell you what it means. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	8	King Nebuchadnezzar answered , “ I know you are trying to get more time , because you know that I meant what I said .
NCV	Daniel	2	9	If you don ’ t tell me my dream , you will be punished . You have all agreed to tell me lies and wicked things , hoping things will change . Now , tell me the dream so that I will know you can tell me what it really means ! ”
NCV	Daniel	2	10	The wise men answered the king , saying , “ No one on earth can do what the king asks ! No great and powerful king has ever asked the fortune-tellers , magicians , or wise men to do this ;
NCV	Daniel	2	11	the king is asking something that is too hard . Only the gods could tell the king this , but the gods do not live among people. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	12	When the king heard their answer , he became very angry . He ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be killed .
NCV	Daniel	2	13	So King Nebuchadnezzar ’ s order to kill the wise men was announced , and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to kill them .
NCV	Daniel	2	14	Arioch , the commander of the king ’ s guards , was going to kill the wise men of Babylon . But Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and skill ,
NCV	Daniel	2	15	saying , “ Why did the king order such a terrible punishment ? ” Then Arioch explained everything to Daniel .
NCV	Daniel	2	16	So Daniel went to King Nebuchadnezzar and asked for an appointment so that he could tell the king what his dream meant .
NCV	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house and explained the whole story to his friends Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
NCV	Daniel	2	18	Daniel asked his friends to pray that the God of heaven would show them mercy and help them understand this secret so he and his friends would not be killed with the other wise men of Babylon .
NCV	Daniel	2	19	During the night God explained the secret to Daniel in a vision . Then Daniel praised the God of heaven .
NCV	Daniel	2	20	Daniel said : “ Praise God forever and ever , because he has wisdom and power .
NCV	Daniel	2	21	He changes the times and seasons of the year . He takes away the power of kings and gives their power to new kings . He gives wisdom to those who are wise and knowledge to those who understand .
NCV	Daniel	2	22	He makes known secrets that are deep and hidden ; he knows what is hidden in darkness , and light is all around him .
NCV	Daniel	2	23	I thank you and praise you , God of my ancestors , because you have given me wisdom and power . You told me what we asked of you ; you told us about the king ’ s dream. ” The Meaning of the Dream
NCV	Daniel	2	24	Then Daniel went to Arioch , the man King Nebuchadnezzar had chosen to kill the wise men of Babylon . Daniel said to him , “ Don ’ t put the wise men of Babylon to death . Take me to the king , and I will tell him what his dream means. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	25	Very quickly Arioch took Daniel to the king and said , “ I have found a man among the captives from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	26	The king asked Daniel , who was also called Belteshazzar , “ Are you able to tell me what I dreamed and what it means ? ”
NCV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered , “ No wise man , magician , or fortune-teller can explain to the king the secret he has asked about .
NCV	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven who explains secret things , and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at a later time . This is your dream , the vision you saw while lying on your bed :
NCV	Daniel	2	29	O king , as you were lying there , you thought about things to come . God , who can tell people about secret things , showed you what is going to happen .
NCV	Daniel	2	30	God also told this secret to me , not because I have greater wisdom than any other living person , but so that you may know what it means . In that way you will understand what went through your mind .
NCV	Daniel	2	31	“ O king , in your dream you saw a huge , shiny , and frightening statue in front of you .
NCV	Daniel	2	32	The head of the statue was made of pure gold . Its chest and arms were made of silver . Its stomach and the upper part of its legs were made of bronze .
NCV	Daniel	2	33	The lower part of the legs were made of iron , while its feet were made partly of iron and partly of baked clay .
NCV	Daniel	2	34	While you were looking at the statue , you saw a rock cut free , but no human being touched the rock . It hit the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them .
NCV	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron , clay , bronze , silver , and gold broke to pieces at the same time . They became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summertime ; the wind blew them away , and there was nothing left . Then the rock that hit the statue became a very large mountain that filled the whole earth .
NCV	Daniel	2	36	“ That was your dream . Now we will tell the king what it means .
NCV	Daniel	2	37	O king , you are the greatest king . God of heaven has given you a kingdom , power , strength , and glory .
NCV	Daniel	2	38	Wherever people , wild animals , and birds live , God made you ruler over them . King Nebuchadnezzar , you are the head of gold on that statue .
NCV	Daniel	2	39	“ Another kingdom will come after you , but it will not be as great as yours . Next a third kingdom , the bronze part , will rule over the earth .
NCV	Daniel	2	40	Then there will be a fourth kingdom , strong as iron . In the same way that iron crushes and smashes things to pieces , the fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms .
NCV	Daniel	2	41	“ You saw that the statue ’ s feet and toes were partly baked clay and partly iron . That means the fourth kingdom will be a divided kingdom . It will have some of the strength of iron in it , just as you saw iron was mixed with clay .
NCV	Daniel	2	42	The toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay . So the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly breakable like clay .
NCV	Daniel	2	43	You saw the iron mixed with clay , but iron and clay do not hold together . In the same way the people of the fourth kingdom will be a mixture , but they will not be united as one people .
NCV	Daniel	2	44	“ During the time of those kings , the God of heaven will set up another kingdom that will never be destroyed or given to another group of people . This kingdom will crush all the other kingdoms and bring them to an end , but it will continue forever .
NCV	Daniel	2	45	“ King Nebuchadnezzar , you saw a rock cut from a mountain , but no human being touched it . The rock broke the iron , bronze , clay , silver , and gold to pieces . In this way the great God showed you what will happen . The dream is true , and you can trust this explanation. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell facedown on the ground in front of Daniel . The king honored him and commanded that an offering and incense be presented to him .
NCV	Daniel	2	47	Then the king said to Daniel , “ Truly I know your God is the greatest of all gods , the Lord of all the kings . He tells people about things they can not know . I know this is true , because you were able to tell these secret things to me. ”
NCV	Daniel	2	48	Then the king gave Daniel many gifts plus an important position in his kingdom . Nebuchadnezzar made him ruler over the whole area of Babylon and put him in charge of all the wise men of Babylon .
NCV	Daniel	2	49	Daniel asked the king to make Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego leaders over the area of Babylon , so the king did as Daniel asked . Daniel himself became one of the people who stayed at the royal court . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	3	3	So they all came for the special service and stood in front of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
NCV	Daniel	3	2	Then he called for the leaders : the governors , assistant governors , captains of the soldiers , people who advised the king , keepers of the treasury , judges , rulers , and all other officers in his kingdom . He wanted them to come to the special service for the statue he had set up .
NCV	Daniel	3	4	Then the man who made announcements for the king said in a loud voice , “ People , nations , and those of every language , this is what you are commanded to do :
NCV	Daniel	3	5	When you hear the sound of the horns , flutes , lyres , zithers , [ a ] harps , pipes , and all the other musical instruments , you must bow down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up .
NCV	Daniel	3	6	Anyone who doesn ’ t bow down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. ”
NCV	Daniel	3	7	Now people , nations , and those who spoke every language were there . When they heard the sound of the horns , flutes , lyres , zithers , pipes , and all the other musical instruments , they bowed down and worshiped the gold statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
NCV	Daniel	3	8	Then some Babylonians came up to the king and began speaking against the men of Judah .
NCV	Daniel	3	9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar , “ O king , live forever !
NCV	Daniel	3	10	O king , you gave a command that everyone who heard the horns , lyres , zithers , harps , pipes , and all the other musical instruments would have to bow down and worship the gold statue .
NCV	Daniel	3	11	Anyone who wouldn ’ t do this was to be thrown into a blazing furnace .
NCV	Daniel	3	12	O king , there are some men of Judah whom you made officers in the area of Babylon that did not pay attention to your order . Their names are Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . They do not serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up. ”
NCV	Daniel	3	13	Nebuchadnezzar became very angry and called for Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . When they were brought to the king ,
NCV	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar said , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , is it true that you do not serve my gods nor worship the gold statue I have set up ?
NCV	Daniel	3	15	In a moment you will again hear the sound of the horns , flutes , lyres , zithers , harps , pipes , and all the other musical instruments . If you bow down and worship the statue I made , that will be good . But if you do not worship it , you will immediately be thrown into the blazing furnace . What god will be able to save you from my power then ? ”
NCV	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered the king , saying , “ Nebuchadnezzar , we do not need to defend ourselves to you .
NCV	Daniel	3	17	If you throw us into the blazing furnace , the God we serve is able to save us from the furnace . He will save us from your power , O king .
NCV	Daniel	3	18	But even if God does not save us , we want you , O king , to know this : We will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up. ”
NCV	Daniel	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , and he changed his mind . He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual .
NCV	Daniel	3	20	Then he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace .
NCV	Daniel	3	21	So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego were tied up and thrown into the blazing furnace while still wearing their robes , trousers , turbans , and other clothes .
NCV	Daniel	3	22	The king ’ s command was very strict , and the furnace was made so hot that the flames killed the strong soldiers who threw Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego into the furnace .
NCV	Daniel	3	23	Firmly tied , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego fell into the blazing furnace .
NCV	Daniel	3	24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar was so surprised that he jumped to his feet . He asked the men who advised him , “ Didn ’ t we tie up only three men and throw them into the fire ? ” They answered , “ Yes , O king. ”
NCV	Daniel	3	25	The king said , “ Look ! I see four men walking around in the fire . They are not tied up , and they are not burned . The fourth man looks like a son of the gods. ”
NCV	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar went to the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , come out ! Servants of the Most High God , come here ! ” So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came out of the fire .
NCV	Daniel	3	27	When they came out , the governors , assistant governors , captains of the soldiers , and royal advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies . Their hair was not burned , their robes were not burned , and they didn ’ t even smell like smoke !
NCV	Daniel	3	28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said , “ Praise the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . Their God has sent his angel and saved his servants from the fire ! These three men trusted their God and refused to obey my command . They were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god other than their own .
NCV	Daniel	3	29	So I now give this command : Anyone from any nation or language who says anything against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego will be torn apart and have his house turned into a pile of stones . No other god can save his people like this. ”
NCV	Daniel	3	30	Then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego in the area of Babylon . Footnotes - 3:5 zithers Musical instruments with thirty to forty strings . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	4	4	I , Nebuchadnezzar , was happy and successful at my palace ,
NCV	Daniel	4	2	The Most High God has done miracles and wonderful things for me that I am happy to tell you about .
NCV	Daniel	4	3	His wonderful acts are great , and his miracles are mighty . His kingdom goes on forever , and his rule continues from now on .
NCV	Daniel	4	5	but I had a dream that made me afraid . As I was lying on my bed , I saw pictures and visions in my mind that alarmed me .
NCV	Daniel	4	6	So I ordered all the wise men of Babylon to come to me and tell me what my dream meant .
NCV	Daniel	4	7	The fortune-tellers , magicians , and wise men came , and I told them about the dream . But they could not tell me what it meant .
NCV	Daniel	4	8	Finally , Daniel came to me . ( I called him Belteshazzar to honor my god , because the spirit of the holy gods is in him . ) I told my dream to him .
NCV	Daniel	4	9	I said , “ Belteshazzar , you are the most important of all the fortune-tellers . I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you , so there is no secret that is too hard for you to understand . This was what I dreamed ; tell me what it means .
NCV	Daniel	4	10	These are the visions I saw while I was lying in my bed : I looked , and there in front of me was a tree standing in the middle of the earth . And it was very tall .
NCV	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew large and strong . The top of the tree touched the sky and could be seen from anywhere on earth .
NCV	Daniel	4	12	The leaves of the tree were beautiful . It had plenty of good fruit on it , enough food for everyone . The wild animals found shelter under the tree , and the birds lived in its branches . Every animal ate from it .
NCV	Daniel	4	13	“ As I was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed , I saw an observer , a holy angel coming down from heaven .
NCV	Daniel	4	14	He spoke very loudly and said , ‘ Cut down the tree and cut off its branches . Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit . Let the animals under the tree run away , and let the birds in its branches fly away .
NCV	Daniel	4	15	But leave the stump and its roots in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it ; let it stay in the field with the grass around it . “ ‘ Let the man become wet with dew , and let him live among the animals and plants of the earth .
NCV	Daniel	4	16	Let him not think like a human any longer , but let him have the mind of an animal for seven years .
NCV	Daniel	4	17	“ ‘ The observers gave this command ; the holy ones declared the sentence . This is so all people may know that the Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth . God gives those kingdoms to anyone he wants , and he chooses people to rule them who are not proud. ’
NCV	Daniel	4	18	“ That is what I , King Nebuchadnezzar , dreamed . Now Belteshazzar , [ a ] tell me what the dream means . None of the wise men in my kingdom can explain it to me , but you can , because the spirit of the holy gods is in you. ” Daniel Explains the Dream
NCV	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel , who was called Belteshazzar , was very quiet for a while , because his understanding of the dream frightened him . So the king said , “ Belteshazzar , do not let the dream or its meaning make you afraid. ” Then Belteshazzar answered , “ My master , I wish the dream were about your enemies , and I wish its meaning were for those who are against you !
NCV	Daniel	4	20	You saw a tree in your dream that grew large and strong . Its top touched the sky , and it could be seen from all over the earth .
NCV	Daniel	4	21	Its leaves were beautiful , and it had plenty of fruit for everyone to eat . It was a home for the wild animals , and its branches were nesting places for the birds .
NCV	Daniel	4	22	O king , you are that tree ! You have become great and powerful , like the tall tree that touched the sky . Your power reaches to the far parts of the earth .
NCV	Daniel	4	23	“ O king , you saw an observer , a holy angel , coming down from heaven who said , ‘ Cut down the tree and destroy it . But leave the stump and its roots in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it ; leave it in the field with the grass . Let him become wet with dew and live like a wild animal for seven years. ’
NCV	Daniel	4	24	“ This is the meaning of the dream , O king . The Most High God has commanded these things to happen to my master the king :
NCV	Daniel	4	25	You will be forced away from people to live among the wild animals . People will feed you grass like an ox , and dew from the sky will make you wet . Seven years will pass , and then you will learn this lesson : The Most High God is ruler over every kingdom on earth , and he gives those kingdoms to anyone he chooses .
NCV	Daniel	4	26	“ Since the stump of the tree and its roots were left in the ground , your kingdom will be given back to you when you learn that one in heaven rules your kingdom .
NCV	Daniel	4	27	So , O king , please accept my advice . Stop sinning and do what is right . Stop doing wicked things and be kind to the poor . Then you might continue to be successful. ” The King ’ s Dream Comes True
NCV	Daniel	4	28	All these things happened to King Nebuchadnezzar .
NCV	Daniel	4	29	Twelve months later as he was walking on the roof [ b ] of his palace in Babylon ,
NCV	Daniel	4	30	he said , “ I have built this great Babylon as my royal home . I built it by my power to show my glory and my majesty. ”
NCV	Daniel	4	31	The words were still in his mouth when a voice from heaven said , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , these things will happen to you : Your royal power has been taken away from you .
NCV	Daniel	4	32	You will be forced away from people . You will live with the wild animals and will be fed grass like an ox . Seven years will pass before you learn this lesson : The Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth and gives those kingdoms to anyone he chooses. ”
NCV	Daniel	4	33	Immediately the words came true . Nebuchadnezzar was forced to go away from people , and he began eating grass like an ox . He became wet from dew . His hair grew long like the feathers of an eagle , and his nails grew like the claws of a bird .
NCV	Daniel	4	34	At the end of that time , I , Nebuchadnezzar , looked up toward heaven , and I could think normally again ! Then I gave praise to the Most High God ; I gave honor and glory to him who lives forever . God ’ s rule is forever , and his kingdom continues for all time .
NCV	Daniel	4	35	People on earth are not truly important . God does what he wants with the powers of heaven and the people on earth . No one can stop his powerful hand or question what he does .
NCV	Daniel	4	36	At that time I could think normally again , and God gave back my great honor and power and returned the glory to my kingdom . The people who advised me and the royal family came to me for help again . I became king again and was even greater and more powerful than before .
NCV	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , give praise and honor and glory to the King of heaven . Everything he does is right and fair , and he is able to make proud people humble . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	5	5	Suddenly the fingers of a person ’ s hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall , near the lampstand in the royal palace . The king watched the hand as it wrote .
NCV	Daniel	5	2	As Belshazzar was drinking his wine , he gave orders to bring the gold and silver cups that his ancestor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem . This was so the king , his royal guests , his wives , and his slave women could drink from those cups .
NCV	Daniel	5	3	So they brought the gold cups that had been taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem . And the king and his royal guests , his wives , and his slave women drank from them .
NCV	Daniel	5	4	As they were drinking , they praised their gods , which were made from gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone .
NCV	Daniel	5	6	King Belshazzar was very frightened . His face turned white , his knees knocked together , and he could not stand up because his legs were too weak .
NCV	Daniel	5	7	The king called for the magicians , wise men , and wizards of Babylon and said to them , “ Anyone who can read this writing and explain it will receive purple clothes fit for a king and a gold chain around his neck . And I will make that person the third highest ruler in the kingdom. ”
NCV	Daniel	5	8	Then all the king ’ s wise men came in , but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant .
NCV	Daniel	5	9	King Belshazzar became even more afraid , and his face became even whiter . His royal guests were confused .
NCV	Daniel	5	10	Then the king ’ s mother , who had heard the voices of the king and his royal guests , came into the banquet room . She said , “ O king , live forever ! Don ’ t be afraid or let your face be white with fear !
NCV	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods . In the days of your father , this man showed understanding , knowledge , and wisdom like the gods . Your father , King Nebuchadnezzar , put this man in charge of all the wise men , fortune-tellers , magicians , and wizards .
NCV	Daniel	5	12	The man I am talking about is named Daniel , whom the king named Belteshazzar . He was very wise and had knowledge and understanding . He could explain dreams and secrets and could answer very hard problems . Call for Daniel . He will tell you what the writing on the wall means. ”
NCV	Daniel	5	13	So they brought Daniel to the king , and the king asked , “ Is your name Daniel ? Are you one of the captives my father the king brought from Judah ?
NCV	Daniel	5	14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that you are very wise and have knowledge and extraordinary understanding .
NCV	Daniel	5	15	The wise men and magicians were brought to me to read this writing and to explain what it means , but they could not explain it .
NCV	Daniel	5	16	I have heard that you are able to explain what things mean and can find the answers to hard problems . Read this writing on the wall and explain it to me . If you can , I will give you purple clothes fit for a king and a gold chain to wear around your neck . And you will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom. ”
NCV	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered the king , “ You may keep your gifts for yourself , or you may give those rewards to someone else . But I will read the writing on the wall for you and will explain to you what it means .
NCV	Daniel	5	18	“ O king , the Most High God made your father Nebuchadnezzar a great , important , and powerful king .
NCV	Daniel	5	19	Because God made him important , all the people , nations , and those who spoke every language were very frightened of Nebuchadnezzar . If he wanted someone to die , he killed that person . If he wanted someone to live , he let that person live . Those he wanted to promote , he promoted . Those he wanted to be less important , he made less important .
NCV	Daniel	5	20	“ But Nebuchadnezzar became too proud and stubborn , so he was taken off his royal throne . His glory was taken away .
NCV	Daniel	5	21	He was forced away from people , and his mind became like the mind of an animal . He lived with the wild donkeys and was fed grass like an ox and became wet with dew . These things happened to him until he learned his lesson : The Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth , and he sets anyone he chooses over those kingdoms .
NCV	Daniel	5	22	“ Belshazzar , you already knew these things , because you are a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar . Still you have not been sorry for what you have done .
NCV	Daniel	5	23	Instead , you have set yourself against the Lord of heaven . You ordered the drinking cups from the Temple of the Lord to be brought to you . Then you and your royal guests , your wives , and your slave women drank wine from them . You praised the gods of silver , gold , bronze , iron , wood , and stone that are not really gods ; they can not see or hear or understand anything . You did not honor God , who has power over your life and everything you do .
NCV	Daniel	5	24	So God sent the hand that wrote on the wall .
NCV	Daniel	5	25	“ These are the words that were written on the wall : ‘ Mene , mene , tekel , and parsin. ’
NCV	Daniel	5	26	“ This is what the words mean : Mene : God has counted the days until your kingdom will end .
NCV	Daniel	5	27	Tekel : You have been weighed on the scales and found not good enough .
NCV	Daniel	5	28	Parsin : Your kingdom is being divided and will be given to the Medes and the Persians. ”
NCV	Daniel	5	29	Then Belshazzar gave an order for Daniel to be dressed in purple clothes and to have a gold chain put around his neck . And it was announced that Daniel was the third highest ruler in the kingdom .
NCV	Daniel	5	30	That very same night Belshazzar , king of the Babylonian people , was killed .

NCV	Daniel	6	6	So the supervisors and governors went as a group to the king and said : “ King Darius , live forever !
NCV	Daniel	6	2	He chose three men as supervisors over those governors , and Daniel was one of the supervisors . The supervisors were to ensure that the governors did not try to cheat the king .
NCV	Daniel	6	3	Daniel showed that he could do the work better than the other supervisors and governors , so the king planned to put Daniel in charge of the whole kingdom .
NCV	Daniel	6	4	Because of this , the other supervisors and governors tried to find reasons to accuse Daniel about his work in the government . But they could not find anything wrong with him or any reason to accuse him , because he was trustworthy and not lazy or dishonest .
NCV	Daniel	6	5	Finally these men said , “ We will never find any reason to accuse Daniel unless it is about the law of his God. ”
NCV	Daniel	6	7	The supervisors , assistant governors , governors , the people who advise you , and the captains of the soldiers have all agreed that you should make a new law for everyone to obey : For the next thirty days no one should pray to any god or human except to you , O king . Anyone who doesn ’ t obey will be thrown into the lions ’ den .
NCV	Daniel	6	8	Now , O king , make the law and sign your name to it so that it can not be changed , because then it will be a law of the Medes and Persians and can not be canceled. ”
NCV	Daniel	6	9	So King Darius signed the law .
NCV	Daniel	6	10	Even though Daniel knew that the new law had been written , he went to pray in an upstairs room in his house , which had windows that opened toward Jerusalem . Three times each day Daniel would kneel down to pray and thank God , just as he always had done .
NCV	Daniel	6	11	Then those men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help .
NCV	Daniel	6	12	So they went to the king and talked to him about the law he had made . They said , “ Didn ’ t you sign a law that says no one may pray to any god or human except you , O king ? Doesn ’ t it say that anyone who disobeys during the next thirty days will be thrown into the lions ’ den ? ” The king answered , “ Yes , that is the law , and the laws of the Medes and Persians can not be canceled. ”
NCV	Daniel	6	13	Then they said to the king , “ Daniel , one of the captives from Judah , is not paying attention to you , O king , or to the law you signed . Daniel still prays to his God three times every day. ”
NCV	Daniel	6	14	The king became very upset when he heard this . He wanted to save Daniel , and he worked hard until sunset trying to think of a way to save him .
NCV	Daniel	6	15	Then those men went as a group to the king . They said , “ Remember , O king , the law of the Medes and Persians says that no law or command given by the king can be changed. ”
NCV	Daniel	6	16	So King Darius gave the order , and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions ’ den . The king said to Daniel , “ May the God you serve all the time save you ! ”
NCV	Daniel	6	17	A big stone was brought and placed over the opening of the lions ’ den . Then the king used his signet ring and the rings of his royal officers to put special seals on the rock . This ensured that no one would move the rock and bring Daniel out .
NCV	Daniel	6	18	Then King Darius went back to his palace . He did not eat that night , he did not have any entertainment brought to him , and he could not sleep .
NCV	Daniel	6	19	The next morning King Darius got up at dawn and hurried to the lions ’ den .
NCV	Daniel	6	20	As he came near the den , he was worried . He called out to Daniel , “ Daniel , servant of the living God ! Has your God that you always worship been able to save you from the lions ? ”
NCV	Daniel	6	21	Daniel answered , “ O king , live forever !
NCV	Daniel	6	22	My God sent his angel to close the lions ’ mouths . They have not hurt me , because my God knows I am innocent . I never did anything wrong to you , O king. ”
NCV	Daniel	6	23	King Darius was very happy and told his servants to lift Daniel out of the lions ’ den . So they lifted him out and did not find any injury on him , because Daniel had trusted in his God .
NCV	Daniel	6	24	Then the king commanded that the men who had accused Daniel be brought to the lions ’ den . They , their wives , and their children were thrown into the den . The lions grabbed them before they hit the floor of the den and crushed their bones .
NCV	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote a letter to all people and all nations , to those who spoke every language in the world : I wish you great peace and wealth .
NCV	Daniel	6	26	I am making a new law for people in every part of my kingdom . All of you must fear and respect the God of Daniel . Daniel ’ s God is the living God ; he lives forever . His kingdom will never be destroyed , and his rule will never end .
NCV	Daniel	6	27	God rescues and saves people and does mighty miracles in heaven and on earth . He is the one who saved Daniel from the power of the lions .

NCV	Daniel	7	7	“ After that , in my vision at night I saw in front of me a fourth animal that was cruel , terrible , and very strong . It had large iron teeth . It crushed and ate what it killed , and then it walked on whatever was left . This fourth animal was different from any animal I had seen before , and it had ten horns .
NCV	Daniel	7	2	Daniel said : “ I saw my vision at night . In the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions , which made the sea very rough .
NCV	Daniel	7	3	I saw four huge animals come up from the sea , and each animal was different from the others .
NCV	Daniel	7	4	“ The first animal looked like a lion , but had wings like an eagle . I watched this animal until its wings were torn off . It was lifted from the ground so that it stood up on two feet like a human , and it was given the mind of a human .
NCV	Daniel	7	5	“ Then I saw a second animal before me that looked like a bear . It was raised up on one of its sides and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . It was told , ‘ Get up and eat all the meat you want ! ’
NCV	Daniel	7	6	“ After that , I looked , and there before me was another animal . This animal looked like a leopard with four wings on its back that looked like a bird ’ s wings . This animal had four heads and was given power to rule .
NCV	Daniel	7	8	“ While I was thinking about the horns , another horn grew up among them . It was a little horn with eyes like a human ’ s eyes . It also had a mouth , and the mouth was bragging . The little horn pulled out three of the other horns .
NCV	Daniel	7	9	“ As I looked , thrones were put in their places , and God , the Eternal One , sat on his throne . His clothes were white like snow , and the hair on his head was white like wool . His throne was made from fire , and the wheels of his throne were blazing with fire .
NCV	Daniel	7	10	A river of fire was flowing from in front of him . Many thousands of angels were serving him , and millions of angels stood before him . Court was ready to begin , and the books were opened .
NCV	Daniel	7	11	“ I kept on looking because the little horn was bragging . I kept watching until finally the fourth animal was killed . Its body was destroyed , and it was thrown into the burning fire .
NCV	Daniel	7	12	( The power and rule of the other animals had been taken from them , but they were permitted to live for a certain period of time . )
NCV	Daniel	7	13	“ In my vision at night I saw in front of me someone who looked like a human being coming on the clouds in the sky . He came near God , who has been alive forever , and he was led to God .
NCV	Daniel	7	14	He was given authority , glory , and the strength of a king . People of every tribe , nation , and language will serve him . His rule will last forever , and his kingdom will never be destroyed . The Meaning of the Dream
NCV	Daniel	7	15	“ I , Daniel , was worried . The visions that went through my mind frightened me .
NCV	Daniel	7	16	I came near one of those standing there and asked what all this meant . “ So he told me and explained to me what these things meant :
NCV	Daniel	7	17	‘ The four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth .
NCV	Daniel	7	18	But the holy people who belong to the Most High God will receive the power to rule and will have the power to rule forever , from now on. ’
NCV	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal meant , because it was different from all the others . It was very terrible and had iron teeth and bronze claws . It was the animal that crushed and ate what it killed and then walked on whatever was left .
NCV	Daniel	7	20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the little horn that grew there . It had pulled out three of the other ten horns and looked greater than the others . It had eyes and a mouth that kept bragging .
NCV	Daniel	7	21	As I watched , the little horn began making war against God ’ s holy people and was defeating them
NCV	Daniel	7	22	until God , who has been alive forever , came . He judged in favor of the holy people who belong to the Most High God ; then the time came for them to receive the power to rule .
NCV	Daniel	7	23	“ And he explained this to me : ‘ The fourth animal is a fourth kingdom that will come on the earth . It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will destroy people all over the world . It will walk on and crush the whole earth .
NCV	Daniel	7	24	The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this fourth kingdom . After those ten kings are gone , another king will come . He will be different from the kings who ruled before him , and he will defeat three of the other kings .
NCV	Daniel	7	25	This king will speak against the Most High God , and he will hurt and kill God ’ s holy people . He will try to change times and laws that have already been set . The holy people that belong to God will be in that king ’ s power for three and one-half years .
NCV	Daniel	7	26	“ ‘ But the court will decide what should happen . The power of the king will be taken away , and his kingdom will be completely destroyed .
NCV	Daniel	7	27	Then the holy people who belong to the Most High God will have the power to rule . They will rule over all the kingdoms under heaven with power and greatness , and their power to rule will last forever . People from all the other kingdoms will respect and serve them. ’

NCV	Daniel	8	8	so the male goat became very great . But when he was strong , his big horn broke off and four horns grew in place of the one big horn . Those four horns pointed in four different directions and were easy to see .
NCV	Daniel	8	2	In this vision I saw myself in the capital city of Susa , in the area of Elam . I was standing by the Ulai Canal
NCV	Daniel	8	3	when I looked up and saw a male sheep standing beside the canal . It had two long horns , but one horn was longer and newer than the other .
NCV	Daniel	8	4	I watched the sheep charge to the west , the north , and the south . No animal could stand before him , and none could save another animal from his power . He did whatever he wanted and became very powerful .
NCV	Daniel	8	5	While I was watching this , I saw a male goat come from the west . This goat had one large horn between his eyes that was easy to see . He crossed over the whole earth so fast that his feet hardly touched the ground .
NCV	Daniel	8	6	In his anger the goat charged the sheep with the two horns that I had seen standing by the canal .
NCV	Daniel	8	7	I watched the angry goat attack the sheep and break the sheep ’ s two horns . The sheep was not strong enough to stop it . The goat knocked the sheep to the ground and then walked all over him . No one was able to save the sheep from the goat ,
NCV	Daniel	8	9	Then a little horn grew from one of those four horns , and it became very big . It grew to the south , the east , and toward the beautiful land of Judah .
NCV	Daniel	8	10	That little horn grew until it reached to the sky . It even threw some of the army of heaven to the ground and walked on them !
NCV	Daniel	8	11	That little horn set itself up as equal to God , the Commander of heaven ’ s armies . It stopped the daily sacrifices that were offered to him , and the Temple , the place where people worshiped him , was pulled down .
NCV	Daniel	8	12	Because there was a turning away from God , the people stopped the daily sacrifices . Truth was thrown down to the ground , and the horn was successful in everything it did .
NCV	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard a holy angel speaking . Another holy angel asked the first one , “ How long will the things in this vision last—the daily sacrifices , the turning away from God that brings destruction , the Temple being pulled down , and the army of heaven being walked on ? ”
NCV	Daniel	8	14	The angel said to me , “ This will happen for twenty-three hundred evenings and mornings . Then the holy place will be repaired. ”
NCV	Daniel	8	15	I , Daniel , saw this vision and tried to understand what it meant . In it I saw someone who looked like a man standing near me .
NCV	Daniel	8	16	And I heard a man ’ s voice calling from the Ulai Canal : “ Gabriel , explain the vision to this man. ”
NCV	Daniel	8	17	Gabriel came to where I was standing . When he came close to me , I was very afraid and bowed facedown on the ground . But Gabriel said to me , “ Human being , understand that this vision is about the time of the end. ”
NCV	Daniel	8	18	While Gabriel was speaking , I fell into a deep sleep with my face on the ground . Then he touched me and lifted me to my feet .
NCV	Daniel	8	19	He said , “ Now , I will explain to you what will happen in the time of God ’ s anger . Your vision was about the set time of the end .
NCV	Daniel	8	20	“ You saw a male sheep with two horns , which are the kings of Media and Persia .
NCV	Daniel	8	21	The male goat is the king of Greece , and the big horn between its eyes is the first king .
NCV	Daniel	8	22	The four horns that grew in the place of the broken horn are four kingdoms . Those four kingdoms will come from the nation of the first king , but they will not be as strong as the first king .
NCV	Daniel	8	23	“ When the end comes near for those kingdoms , a bold and cruel king who tells lies will come . This will happen when many people have turned against God .
NCV	Daniel	8	24	This king will be very powerful , but his power will not come from himself . He will cause terrible destruction and will be successful in everything he does . He will destroy powerful people and even God ’ s holy people .
NCV	Daniel	8	25	This king will succeed by using lies and force . He will think that he is very important . He will destroy many people without warning ; he will try to fight even the Prince of princes ! But that cruel king will be destroyed , and not by human power .
NCV	Daniel	8	26	“ The vision that has been shown to you about these evenings and mornings is true . But seal up the vision , because those things won ’ t happen for a long time. ”
NCV	Daniel	8	27	I , Daniel , became very weak and was sick for several days after that vision . Then I got up and went back to work for the king , but I was very upset about the vision . I didn ’ t understand what it meant . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	9	9	“ But , Lord our God , you show us mercy and forgive us even though we have turned against you .
NCV	Daniel	9	2	During Darius ’ first year as king , I , Daniel , was reading the Scriptures . I saw that the Lord told Jeremiah that Jerusalem would be empty ruins for seventy years .
NCV	Daniel	9	3	Then I turned to the Lord God and prayed and asked him for help . To show my sadness , I fasted , put on rough cloth , and sat in ashes .
NCV	Daniel	9	4	I prayed to the Lord my God and told him about all of our sins . I said , “ Lord , you are a great God who causes fear and wonder . You keep your agreement of love with all who love you and obey your commands .
NCV	Daniel	9	5	“ But we have sinned and done wrong . We have been wicked and turned against you , your commands , and your laws .
NCV	Daniel	9	6	We did not listen to your servants , the prophets , who spoke for you to our kings , our leaders , our ancestors , and all the people of the land .
NCV	Daniel	9	7	“ Lord , you are good and right , but we are full of shame today—the people of Judah and Jerusalem , all the people of Israel , those near and far whom you scattered among many nations because they were not loyal to you .
NCV	Daniel	9	8	Lord , we are all ashamed . Our kings and leaders and our fathers are ashamed , because we have sinned against you .
NCV	Daniel	9	10	We have not obeyed the Lord our God or the teachings he gave us through his servants , the prophets .
NCV	Daniel	9	11	All the people of Israel have disobeyed your teachings and have turned away , refusing to obey you . So you brought on us the curses and promises of punishment written in the Teachings of Moses , the servant of God , because we sinned against you .
NCV	Daniel	9	12	“ You said these things would happen to us and our leaders , and you made them happen ; you brought on us a great disaster . Nothing has ever been done on earth like what was done to Jerusalem .
NCV	Daniel	9	13	All this disaster came to us just as it is written in the Teachings of Moses . But we have not pleaded with the Lord our God . We have not stopped sinning . We have not paid attention to your truth .
NCV	Daniel	9	14	The Lord was ready to bring the disaster on us , and he did it because the Lord our God is right in everything he does . But we still did not obey him .
NCV	Daniel	9	15	“ Lord our God , you used your power and brought us out of Egypt . Because of that , your name is known even today . But we have sinned and have done wrong .
NCV	Daniel	9	16	Lord , you do what is right , but please do not be angry with Jerusalem , your city on your holy hill . Because of our sins and the evil things done by our ancestors , people all around insult and make fun of Jerusalem and your people .
NCV	Daniel	9	17	“ Now , our God , hear the prayers of your servant . Listen to my prayer for help , and for your sake do good things for your holy place that is in ruins .
NCV	Daniel	9	18	My God , pay attention and hear me . Open your eyes and see all the terrible things that have happened to us . See how our lives have been ruined and what has happened to the city that is called by your name . We do not ask these things because we are good ; instead , we ask because of your mercy .
NCV	Daniel	9	19	Lord , listen ! Lord , forgive ! Lord , hear us and do something ! For your sake , don ’ t wait , because your city and your people are called by your name. ” Gabriel ’ s Explanation
NCV	Daniel	9	20	While I was saying these things in my prayer to the Lord , my God , confessing my sins and the sins of the people of Israel and praying for God ’ s holy hill ,
NCV	Daniel	9	21	Gabriel came to me . ( I had seen him in my last vision . ) He came flying quickly to me about the time of the evening sacrifice , while I was still praying .
NCV	Daniel	9	22	He taught me and said to me , “ Daniel , I have come to give you wisdom and to help you understand .
NCV	Daniel	9	23	When you first started praying , an answer was given , and I came to tell you , because God loves you very much . So think about the message and understand the vision .
NCV	Daniel	9	24	“ God has ordered four hundred ninety years for your people and your holy city for these reasons : to stop people from turning against God ; to put an end to sin ; to take away evil ; to bring in goodness that continues forever ; to bring about the vision and prophecy ; and to appoint a most holy place .
NCV	Daniel	9	25	“ Learn and understand these things . A command will come to rebuild Jerusalem . The time from this command until the appointed leader comes will be forty-nine years and four hundred thirty-four years . Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and a trench filled with water around it , but it will be built in times of trouble .
NCV	Daniel	9	26	After the four hundred thirty-four years the appointed leader will be killed ; he will have nothing . The people of the leader who is to come will destroy the city and the holy place . The end of the city will come like a flood , and war will continue until the end . God has ordered that place to be completely destroyed .
NCV	Daniel	9	27	That leader will make firm an agreement with many people for seven years . He will stop the offerings and sacrifices after three and one-half years . A destroyer will do blasphemous things until the ordered end comes to the destroyed city. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	10	10	Then a hand touched me and set me on my hands and knees . I was so afraid that I was shaking .
NCV	Daniel	10	2	At that time I , Daniel , had been very sad for three weeks .
NCV	Daniel	10	3	I did not eat any fancy food or meat , or drink any wine , or use any perfumed oil for three weeks .
NCV	Daniel	10	4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month , I was standing beside the great Tigris River .
NCV	Daniel	10	5	While standing there , I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothes with a belt of fine gold wrapped around his waist .
NCV	Daniel	10	6	His body was like shiny yellow quartz . His face was bright like lightning , and his eyes were like fire . His arms and legs were shiny like polished bronze , and his voice sounded like the roar of a crowd .
NCV	Daniel	10	7	I , Daniel , was the only person who saw the vision . The men with me did not see it , because they were so frightened that they ran away and hid .
NCV	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone , watching this great vision . I lost my strength , my face turned white like a dead person , and I was helpless .
NCV	Daniel	10	9	Then I heard the man in the vision speaking . As I listened , I fell into a deep sleep with my face on the ground .
NCV	Daniel	10	11	The man in the vision said to me , “ Daniel , God loves you very much . Think carefully about the words I will speak to you , and stand up , because I have been sent to you. ” When he said this , I stood up , but I was still shaking .
NCV	Daniel	10	12	Then the man said to me , “ Daniel , do not be afraid . Some time ago you decided to get understanding and to humble yourself before your God . Since that time God has listened to you , and I have come because of your prayers .
NCV	Daniel	10	13	But the prince of Persia has been fighting against me for twenty-one days . Then Michael , one of the most important angels , came to help me , because I had been left there with the king of Persia .
NCV	Daniel	10	14	Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people , because the vision is about a time in the future. ”
NCV	Daniel	10	15	While he was speaking to me , I bowed facedown and could not speak .
NCV	Daniel	10	16	Then one who looked like a man touched my lips , so I opened my mouth and started to speak . I said to the one standing in front of me , “ Master , I am upset and afraid because of what I saw in the vision . I feel helpless .
NCV	Daniel	10	17	Master , how can I , your servant , talk with you ? My strength is gone , and it is hard for me to breathe. ”
NCV	Daniel	10	18	The one who looked like a man touched me again and gave me strength .
NCV	Daniel	10	19	He said , “ Daniel , don ’ t be afraid . God loves you very much . Peace be with you . Be strong now ; be courageous. ” When he spoke to me , I became stronger and said , “ Master , speak , since you have given me strength. ”
NCV	Daniel	10	20	Then he said , “ Daniel , do you know why I have come to you ? Soon I must go back to fight against the prince of Persia . When I go , the prince of Greece will come ,
NCV	Daniel	10	21	but I must first tell you what is written in the Book of Truth . No one stands with me against these enemies except Michael , the angel ruling over your people . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	11	11	Then the king of the South will become very angry and will march out to fight against the king of the North . The king of the North will have a large army , but he will lose the battle ,
NCV	Daniel	11	2	“ Now then , Daniel , I tell you the truth : Three more kings will rule in Persia , and then a fourth king will come . He will be much richer than all the kings of Persia before him and will use his riches to get power . He will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece .
NCV	Daniel	11	3	Then a mighty king will come , who will rule with great power and will do anything he wants .
NCV	Daniel	11	4	After that king has come , his kingdom will be broken up and divided out toward the four parts of the world . His kingdom will not go to his descendants , and it will not have the power that he had , because his kingdom will be pulled up and given to other people .
NCV	Daniel	11	5	“ The king of the South will become strong , but one of his commanders will become even stronger . He will begin to rule his own kingdom with great power .
NCV	Daniel	11	6	Then after a few years , a new friendship will develop . The daughter of the king of the South will marry the king of the North in order to bring peace . But she will not keep her power , and his family will not last . She , her husband , her child , and those who brought her to that country will be killed .
NCV	Daniel	11	7	“ But a person from her family will become king of the South and will attack the armies of the king of the North . He will go into that king ’ s strong , walled city and will fight and win .
NCV	Daniel	11	8	He will take their gods , their metal idols , and their valuable things made of silver and gold back to Egypt . Then he will not bother the king of the North for a few years .
NCV	Daniel	11	9	Next , the king of the North will attack the king of the South , but he will be beaten back to his own country .
NCV	Daniel	11	10	“ The sons of the king of the North will prepare for war . They will get a large army together that will move through the land very quickly , like a powerful flood . Later , that army will come back and fight all the way to the strong , walled city of the king of the South .
NCV	Daniel	11	12	and the soldiers will be carried away . The king of the South will then be very proud and will kill thousands of soldiers from the northern army , but he will not continue to be successful .
NCV	Daniel	11	13	The king of the North will gather another army , larger than the first one . After several years he will attack with a large army and many weapons .
NCV	Daniel	11	14	“ In those times many people will be against the king of the South . Some of your own people who love to fight will turn against the king of the South , thinking it is time for God ’ s promises to come true . But they will fail .
NCV	Daniel	11	15	Then the king of the North will come . He will build ramps to the tops of the city walls and will capture a strong , walled city . The southern army will not have the power to fight back ; even their best soldiers will not be strong enough to stop the northern army .
NCV	Daniel	11	16	So the king of the North will do whatever he wants ; no one will be able to stand against him . He will gain power and control in the beautiful land of Israel and will have the power to destroy it .
NCV	Daniel	11	17	The king of the North will decide to use all his power to fight against the king of the South , but he will make a peace agreement with the king of the South . The king of the North will give one of his daughters as a wife to the king of the South so that he can defeat him . But those plans will not succeed or help him .
NCV	Daniel	11	18	Then the king of the North will turn his attention to cities along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and will capture them . But a commander will put an end to the pride of the king of the North , turning his pride back on him .
NCV	Daniel	11	19	After that happens the king of the North will go back to the strong , walled cities of his own country , but he will lose his power . That will be the end of him .
NCV	Daniel	11	20	“ The next king of the North will send out a tax collector so he will have plenty of money . In a few years that ruler will be killed , although he will not die in anger or in a battle .
NCV	Daniel	11	21	“ That ruler will be followed by a very cruel and hated man , who will not have the honor of being from a king ’ s family . He will attack the kingdom when the people feel safe , and he will take power by lying to the people .
NCV	Daniel	11	22	He will sweep away in defeat large and powerful armies and even a prince who made an agreement .
NCV	Daniel	11	23	Many nations will make agreements with that cruel and hated ruler , but he will lie to them . He will gain much power , but only a few people will support him .
NCV	Daniel	11	24	The richest areas will feel safe , but that cruel and hated ruler will attack them . He will succeed where his ancestors did not . He will rob the countries he defeats and will give those things to his followers . He will plan to defeat and destroy strong cities , but he will be successful for only a short time .
NCV	Daniel	11	25	“ That very cruel and hated ruler will have a large army that he will use to stir up his strength and courage . He will attack the king of the South . The king of the South will gather a large and very powerful army and prepare for war . But the people who are against him will make secret plans , and the king of the South will be defeated .
NCV	Daniel	11	26	People who were supposed to be his good friends will try to destroy him . His army will be swept away in defeat ; many of his soldiers will be killed in battle .
NCV	Daniel	11	27	Those two kings will want to hurt each other . They will sit at the same table and lie to each other , but it will not do either one any good , because God has set a time for their end to come .
NCV	Daniel	11	28	The king of the North will go back to his own country with much wealth . Then he will decide to go against the holy agreement . He will take action and then return to his own country .
NCV	Daniel	11	29	“ At the right time the king of the North will attack the king of the South again , but this time he will not be successful as he was before .
NCV	Daniel	11	30	Ships from the west will come and fight against the king of the North , so he will be afraid . Then he will return and show his anger against the holy agreement . He will be good to those who have stopped obeying the holy agreement .
NCV	Daniel	11	31	“ The king of the North will send his army to make the Temple in Jerusalem unclean . They will stop the people from offering the daily sacrifice , and then they will set up a blasphemous object that brings destruction .
NCV	Daniel	11	32	The king of the North will tell lies and cause those who have not obeyed God to be ruined . But those who know God and obey him will be strong and fight back .
NCV	Daniel	11	33	“ Those who are wise will help the others understand what is happening . But they will be killed with swords , or burned , or taken captive , or robbed of their homes and possessions . These things will continue for many days .
NCV	Daniel	11	34	When the wise ones are suffering , they will get a little help , but many who join the wise ones will not help them in their time of need .
NCV	Daniel	11	35	Some of the wise ones will be killed . But the hard times must come so they can be made stronger and purer and without faults until the time of the end comes . Then , at the right time , the end will come . The King Who Praises Himself
NCV	Daniel	11	36	“ The king of the North will do whatever he wants . He will brag about himself and praise himself and think he is even better than a god . He will say things against the God of gods that no one has ever heard . And he will be successful until all the bad things have happened . Then what God has planned to happen will happen .
NCV	Daniel	11	37	The king of the North will not care about the gods his ancestors worshiped or the god that women worship . He won ’ t care about any god . Instead , he will make himself more important than any god .
NCV	Daniel	11	38	The king of the North will worship power and strength , which his ancestors did not worship . He will honor the god of power with gold and silver , expensive jewels and gifts .
NCV	Daniel	11	39	That king will attack strong , walled cities with the help of a foreign god . He will give much honor to the people who join him , making them rulers in charge of many other people . And he will make them pay him for the land they rule .
NCV	Daniel	11	40	“ At the time of the end , the king of the South will fight a battle against the king of the North . The king of the North will attack with chariots , soldiers on horses , and many large ships . He will invade many countries and sweep through their lands like a flood .
NCV	Daniel	11	41	The king of the North will attack the beautiful land of Judah . He will defeat many countries , but Edom , Moab , and the leaders of Ammon will be saved from him .
NCV	Daniel	11	42	The king of the North will show his power in many countries ; Egypt will not escape .
NCV	Daniel	11	43	The king will get treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt . The Libyan and Nubian people will obey him .
NCV	Daniel	11	44	But the king of the North will hear news from the east and the north that will make him afraid and angry . He will go to destroy completely many nations .
NCV	Daniel	11	45	He will set up his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful mountain where the holy Temple is built . But , finally , his end will come , and no one will help him . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Daniel	12	12	Those who wait for the end of the 1,335 days will be happy .
NCV	Daniel	12	2	Many people who have already died will live again . Some of them will wake up to have life forever , but some will wake up to find shame and disgrace forever .
NCV	Daniel	12	3	The wise people will shine like the brightness of the sky . Those who teach others to live right will shine like stars forever and ever .
NCV	Daniel	12	4	“ But you , Daniel , close up the book and seal it . These things will happen at the time of the end . Many people will go here and there to find true knowledge. ”
NCV	Daniel	12	5	Then I , Daniel , looked , and saw two other men . One was standing on my side of the river , and the other was standing on the far side .
NCV	Daniel	12	6	The man who was dressed in linen was standing over the water in the river . One of the two men spoke to him and asked , “ How long will it be before these amazing things come true ? ”
NCV	Daniel	12	7	The man dressed in linen , who stood over the water , raised his hands toward heaven . And I heard him swear by the name of God who lives forever , “ It will be for three and one-half years . The power of the holy people will finally be broken , and then all these things will come true. ”
NCV	Daniel	12	8	I heard the answer , but I did not really understand , so I asked , “ Master , what will happen after all these things come true ? ”
NCV	Daniel	12	9	He answered , “ Go your way , Daniel . The message is closed up and sealed until the time of the end .
NCV	Daniel	12	10	Many people will be made clean , pure , and spotless , but the wicked will continue to be wicked . Those wicked people will not understand these things , but the wise will understand them .
NCV	Daniel	12	11	“ The daily sacrifice will be stopped . Then , after 1,290 days from that time , a blasphemous object that brings destruction will be set up .
NCV	Daniel	12	13	“ As for you , Daniel , go your way until the end . You will get your rest , and at the end you will rise to receive your reward. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Hosea	1	1	The Lord spoke his word to Hosea son of Beeri during the time that Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah were kings of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel . Hosea ’ s Wife and Children
NCV	Hosea	1	2	When the Lord began speaking through Hosea , the Lord said to him , “ Go , and marry an unfaithful woman and have unfaithful children , because the people in this country have been completely unfaithful to the Lord. ”
NCV	Hosea	1	3	So Hosea married Gomer daughter of Diblaim , and she became pregnant and gave birth to Hosea ’ s son .
NCV	Hosea	1	4	The Lord said to Hosea , “ Name him Jezreel , because soon I will punish the family of Jehu for the people they killed at Jezreel . In the future I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel
NCV	Hosea	1	5	and break the power of Israel ’ s army in the Valley of Jezreel. ”
NCV	Hosea	1	6	Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter . The Lord said to Hosea , “ Name her Lo-Ruhamah , [ a ] because I will not pity Israel anymore , nor will I forgive them .
NCV	Hosea	1	7	But I will show pity to the people of Judah . I will save them , but not by using bows or swords , horses or horsemen , or weapons of war . I , the Lord their God , will save them. ”
NCV	Hosea	1	8	After Gomer had stopped nursing Lo-Ruhamah , she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son .
NCV	Hosea	1	9	The Lord said , “ Name him Lo-Ammi , [ b ] because you are not my people , and I am not your God . God ’ s Promise to Israel

NCV	Hosea	2	2	“ Plead with your mother . [ a ] Accuse her , because she is no longer my wife , and I am no longer her husband . Tell her to stop acting like a prostitute , to stop behaving like an unfaithful wife .
NCV	Hosea	2	3	If she refuses , I will strip her naked and leave her bare like the day she was born . I will make her dry like a desert , like a land without water , and I will kill her with thirst .
NCV	Hosea	2	4	I will not take pity on her children , because they are the children of a prostitute .
NCV	Hosea	2	5	Their mother has acted like a prostitute ; the one who became pregnant with them has acted disgracefully . She said , ‘ I will chase after my lovers , [ b ] who give me my food and water , wool and flax , wine and olive oil. ’
NCV	Hosea	2	6	So I will block her road with thornbushes ; I will build a wall around her so she can not find her way .
NCV	Hosea	2	7	She will run after her lovers , but she won ’ t catch them . She will look for them , but she won ’ t find them . Then she will say , ‘ I will go back to my first husband , [ c ] because life was better then for me than it is now. ’
NCV	Hosea	2	8	But she does not know that I was the one who gave her grain , new wine , and oil . I gave her much silver and gold , but she used it for Baal .
NCV	Hosea	2	9	“ So I will come back and take away my grain at harvest time and my new wine when it is ready . I will take back my wool and linen that covered her nakedness .
NCV	Hosea	2	10	So I will show her nakedness to her lovers , and no one will save her from me .
NCV	Hosea	2	11	I will put an end to all her celebrations : her yearly festivals , her New Moon festivals , and her Sabbaths . I will stop all of her special feasts .
NCV	Hosea	2	12	I will destroy her vines and fig trees , which she said were her pay from her lovers . I will turn them into a forest , and wild animals will eat them .
NCV	Hosea	2	13	I will punish her for all the times she burned incense to the Baals . She put on her rings and jewelry and went chasing after her lovers , but she forgot me ! ” says the Lord .
NCV	Hosea	2	14	“ So I am going to attract her ; I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her .
NCV	Hosea	2	15	There I will give her back her vineyards , and I will make the Valley of Trouble a door of hope . There she will respond as when she was young , as when she came out of Egypt. ”

NCV	Hosea	2	17	I will never let her say the names of Baal again ; people won ’ t use their names anymore .
NCV	Hosea	2	18	At that time I will make an agreement for them with the wild animals , the birds , and the crawling things . I will smash from the land the bow and the sword and the weapons of war , so my people will live in safety .
NCV	Hosea	2	19	And I will make you my promised bride forever . I will be good and fair ; I will show you my love and mercy .

NCV	Hosea	2	23	I will plant my people in the land , and I will show pity to the one I had called ‘ not shown pity. ’ I will say , ‘ You are my people ’ to those I had called ‘ not my people. ’ And they will say to me , ‘ You are our God. ’ ” Footnotes - 2:2 mother Refers to the nation of Israel here . - 2:5 lovers Refers to the nations surrounding Israel , who led Israel to worship false gods . - 2:7 husband Refers to God here . - 2:16 baal Another Hebrew word for husband , but it was the same word as the false god Baal . - 2:22 Jezreel This name in Hebrew means “ God plants. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Hosea	3	3	Then I told her , “ You must wait for me for many days . You must not be a prostitute , and you must not have sexual relations with any other man . I will act the same way toward you. ”
NCV	Hosea	3	2	So I bought her for six ounces of silver and ten bushels of barley .
NCV	Hosea	3	4	In the same way Israel will live many days without a king or leader , without sacrifices or holy stone pillars , and without the holy vest or an idol .
NCV	Hosea	3	5	After this , the people of Israel will return to the Lord their God and follow him and the king from David ’ s family .

NCV	Hosea	4	4	“ No one should accuse or blame another person . Don ’ t blame the people , you priests , when they quarrel with you .
NCV	Hosea	4	2	Cursing , lying , killing , stealing and adultery are everywhere . One murder follows another .
NCV	Hosea	4	3	Because of this the land dries up , and all its people are dying . Even the wild animals and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying . God ’ s Case Against the Priests
NCV	Hosea	4	5	You will be ruined in the day , and your prophets will be ruined with you in the night . I will also destroy your mother . [ a ]
NCV	Hosea	4	6	My people will be destroyed , because they have no knowledge . You have refused to learn , so I will refuse to let you be priests to me . You have forgotten the teachings of your God , so I will forget your children .
NCV	Hosea	4	7	The more priests there are , the more they sin against me . I will take away their honor and give them shame .
NCV	Hosea	4	8	Since the priests live off the sin offerings of the people , they want the people to sin more and more .
NCV	Hosea	4	9	The priests are as wrong as the people , and I will punish them both for what they have done . I will repay them for the wrong they have done .
NCV	Hosea	4	10	“ They will eat but not have enough ; they will have sexual relations with the prostitutes , but they will not have children , because they have left the Lord to give themselves to
NCV	Hosea	4	11	prostitution , to old and new wine , which take away their ability to understand . God ’ s Case Against the People
NCV	Hosea	4	12	“ My people ask wooden idols for advice ; they ask those sticks of wood to advise them ! Like prostitutes , they have chased after other gods and have left their own God .
NCV	Hosea	4	13	They make sacrifices on the tops of the mountains . They burn offerings on the hills , under oaks , poplars , and other trees , because their shade is nice . So your daughters become prostitutes , and your daughters-in-law are guilty of adultery .
NCV	Hosea	4	14	“ But I will not punish your daughters for becoming prostitutes , nor your daughters-in-law for their sins of adultery . I will not punish them , because the men have sexual relations with prostitutes and offer sacrifices with the temple prostitutes . A foolish people will be ruined .
NCV	Hosea	4	15	“ Israel , you act like a prostitute , but do not be guilty toward the Lord . Don ’ t go to Gilgal or go up to Beth Aven . [ b ] Don ’ t make promises , saying , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives . . . ’
NCV	Hosea	4	16	The people of Israel are stubborn like a stubborn young cow . Now the Lord will feed them like lambs in the open country .
NCV	Hosea	4	17	The Israelites have chosen to worship idols , so leave them alone .
NCV	Hosea	4	18	When they finish their drinking , they completely give themselves to being prostitutes ; they love these disgraceful ways .

NCV	Hosea	5	5	Israel ’ s pride testifies against them . The people of Israel will stumble because of their sin , and the people of Judah will stumble with them .
NCV	Hosea	5	2	You have done many evil things , so I will punish you all .
NCV	Hosea	5	3	I know all about the people of Israel ; what they have done is not hidden from me . Now that Israel acts like a prostitute , it has made itself unclean .
NCV	Hosea	5	4	“ They will not give up their deeds and return to their God . They are determined to be unfaithful to me ; they do not know the Lord .
NCV	Hosea	5	6	They will come to worship the Lord , bringing their flocks and herds , but they will not be able to find him , because he has left them .
NCV	Hosea	5	7	They have not been true to the Lord ; they are children who do not belong to him . So their false worship will destroy them and their land .
NCV	Hosea	5	8	“ Blow the horn in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah . Give the warning at Beth Aven , and be first into battle , people of Benjamin .
NCV	Hosea	5	9	Israel will be ruined on the day of punishment . To the tribes of Israel I tell the truth .
NCV	Hosea	5	10	The leaders of Judah are like those who steal other people ’ s land . I will pour my punishment over them like a flood of water .
NCV	Hosea	5	11	Israel is crushed by the punishment , because it decided to follow idols .
NCV	Hosea	5	12	I am like a moth to Israel , like a rot to the people of Judah .
NCV	Hosea	5	13	“ When Israel saw its illness and Judah saw its wounds , Israel went to Assyria for help and sent to the great king of Assyria . But he can not heal you or cure your wounds .
NCV	Hosea	5	14	I will be like a lion to Israel , like a young lion to Judah . I will attack them and tear them to pieces . I will drag them off , and no one will be able to save them .

NCV	Hosea	6	3	and know him . Let ’ s try to learn about the Lord ; he will come to us as surely as the dawn comes . He will come to us like rain , like the spring rain that waters the ground. ”
NCV	Hosea	6	4	The Lord says , “ Israel , what should I do with you ? Judah , what should I do with you ? Your faithfulness is like a morning mist , like the dew that goes away early in the day .
NCV	Hosea	6	5	I have warned you by my prophets that I will kill you and destroy you . My justice comes out like bright light .
NCV	Hosea	6	7	But they have broken the agreement as Adam did ; they have been unfaithful to me .
NCV	Hosea	6	8	Gilead is a city of people who do evil ; their footprints are bloody .
NCV	Hosea	6	9	The priests are like robbers waiting to attack people ; they murder people on the road to Shechem [ a ] and do wicked things .

NCV	Hosea	7	7	All these people are as hot as an oven ; they burn up their rulers . All their kings fall , and no one calls on me . Israel and the Other Nations
NCV	Hosea	7	2	It never enters their minds that I remember all their evil deeds . The bad things they do are all around them ; they are right in front of me . Israel ’ s Evil Kings
NCV	Hosea	7	3	“ They make the king happy with their wickedness ; their rulers are glad with their lies .
NCV	Hosea	7	4	But all of them are traitors . They are like an oven heated by a baker . While he mixes the dough , he does not need to stir up the fire .
NCV	Hosea	7	5	The kings get so drunk they get sick every day . The rulers become crazy with wine ; they make agreements with those who do not know the true God .
NCV	Hosea	7	6	They burn like an oven ; their hearts burn inside them . All night long their anger is low , but when morning comes , it becomes a roaring fire .
NCV	Hosea	7	8	“ Israel mixes with other nations ; he is like a pancake cooked only on one side .
NCV	Hosea	7	9	Foreign nations have eaten up his strength , but he doesn ’ t know it . Israel is weak and feeble , like an old man , but he doesn ’ t know it .
NCV	Hosea	7	10	Israel ’ s pride will cause their defeat ; they will not turn back to the Lord their God or look to him for help in all this .
NCV	Hosea	7	11	Israel has become like a pigeon— easy to fool and stupid . First they call to Egypt for help . Then they run to Assyria .
NCV	Hosea	7	12	When they go , I will catch them in a net , I will bring them down like birds from the sky ; I will punish them countless times for their evil .
NCV	Hosea	7	13	How terrible for them because they left me ! They will be destroyed , because they turned against me . I want to save them , but they have spoken lies against me .
NCV	Hosea	7	14	They do not call to me from their hearts . They just lie on their beds and cry . They come together to ask for grain and new wine , but they really turn away from me .
NCV	Hosea	7	15	Though I trained them and gave them strength , they have made evil plans against me .
NCV	Hosea	7	16	They did not turn to the Most High God . They are like a loose bow that can ’ t shoot . Because their leaders brag about their strength , they will be killed with swords , and the people in Egypt will laugh at them . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Hosea	8	8	Israel is eaten up ; the people are mixed among the other nations and have become useless to me .
NCV	Hosea	8	2	They cry out to me , ‘ Our God , we in Israel know you ! ’
NCV	Hosea	8	3	But Israel has rejected what is good , so the enemy will chase them .
NCV	Hosea	8	4	They chose their own kings without asking my permission . They chose their own leaders , people I did not know . They made their silver and gold into idols , and for all this they will be destroyed .
NCV	Hosea	8	5	I hate the calf-shaped idol of Israel ! I am very angry with the people . How long will they remain unclean ?
NCV	Hosea	8	6	The idol is something a craftsman made ; it is not God . Israel ’ s calf-shaped idol will surely be smashed to pieces .
NCV	Hosea	8	7	“ Israel ’ s foolish plans are like planting the wind , but they will harvest a storm . Like a stalk with no head of grain , it produces nothing . Even if it produced something , other nations would eat it .
NCV	Hosea	8	9	Israel is like a wild donkey all by itself . They have run to Assyria ; They have hired other nations to protect them .
NCV	Hosea	8	10	Although Israel is mixed among the nations , I will gather them together . They will become weaker and weaker as they suffer under the great king of Assyria .
NCV	Hosea	8	11	“ Although Israel built more altars to remove sin , they have become altars for sinning .
NCV	Hosea	8	12	I have written many teachings for them , but they think the teachings are strange and foreign .
NCV	Hosea	8	13	The Israelites offer sacrifices to me as gifts and eat the meat , but the Lord is not pleased with them . He remembers the evil they have done , and he will punish them for their sins . They will be slaves again as they were in Egypt .

NCV	Hosea	9	9	The people of Israel have gone deep into sin as the people of Gibeah [ b ] did . The Lord will remember the evil things they have done , and he will punish their sins .
NCV	Hosea	9	2	But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed the people , and there won ’ t be enough new wine .
NCV	Hosea	9	3	The people will not stay in the Lord ’ s land . Israel will return to being captives as they were in Egypt , and in Assyria they will eat food that they are not allowed to eat .
NCV	Hosea	9	4	The Israelites will not give offerings of wine to the Lord ; they will not give him sacrifices . Their sacrifices will be like food that is eaten at a funeral ; it is unclean , and everyone who eats it becomes unclean . Their food will only satisfy their hunger ; they can not sacrifice it in the Temple .
NCV	Hosea	9	5	What will you do then on the day of feasts and on the day of the Lord ’ s festival ?
NCV	Hosea	9	6	Even if the people are not destroyed , Egypt will capture them ; Memphis [ a ] will bury them . Weeds will grow over their silver treasures , and thorns will drive them out of their tents .
NCV	Hosea	9	7	The time of punishment has come , the time to pay for sins . Let Israel know this : You think the prophet is a fool , and you say the spiritual person is crazy . You have sinned very much , and your hatred is great .
NCV	Hosea	9	8	Is Israel a watchman ? Are God ’ s people prophets ? Everywhere Israel goes , traps are set for him . He is an enemy in God ’ s house .
NCV	Hosea	9	10	“ When I found Israel , it was like finding grapes in the desert . Your ancestors were like finding the first figs on the fig tree . But when they came to Baal Peor , they began worshiping an idol , and they became as hateful as the thing they worshiped .
NCV	Hosea	9	11	Israel ’ s glory will fly away like a bird ; there will be no more pregnancy , no more births , no more getting pregnant .
NCV	Hosea	9	12	But even if the Israelites bring up children , I will take them all away . How terrible it will be for them when I go away from them !
NCV	Hosea	9	13	I have seen Israel , like Tyre , given a pleasant place . But the people of Israel will soon bring out their children to be killed. ”
NCV	Hosea	9	14	Lord , give them what they should have . What will you give them ? Make their women unable to have children ; give them dried-up breasts that can not feed their babies .
NCV	Hosea	9	15	“ The Israelites were very wicked in Gilgal , so I have hated them there . Because of the sinful things they have done , I will force them to leave my land . I will no longer love them ; their leaders have turned against me .
NCV	Hosea	9	16	Israel is beaten down ; its root is dying , and it has no fruit . If they have more children , I will kill the children they love. ”

NCV	Hosea	10	10	When I am ready , I will come to punish them . Nations will come together against them , and they will be punished for their double sins .
NCV	Hosea	10	2	Their heart was false , and now they must pay for their guilt . The Lord will break down their altars ; he will destroy their holy stone pillars .
NCV	Hosea	10	3	Then they will say , “ We have no king , because we didn ’ t honor the Lord . As for the king , he couldn ’ t do anything for us. ”
NCV	Hosea	10	4	They make many false promises and agreements which they don ’ t keep . So people sue each other in court ; they are like poisonous weeds growing in a plowed field .
NCV	Hosea	10	5	The people from Israel are worried about the calf-shaped idol at Beth Aven . The people will cry about it , and the priests will cry about it . They used to shout for joy about its glory ,
NCV	Hosea	10	6	but it will be carried off to Assyria as a gift to the great king . Israel will be disgraced , and the people will be ashamed for not obeying .
NCV	Hosea	10	7	Israel will be destroyed ; its king will be like a chip of wood floating on the water .
NCV	Hosea	10	8	The places of false worship will be destroyed , the places where Israel sins . Thorns and weeds will grow up and cover their altars . Then they will say to the mountains , “ Cover us ! ” and to the hills , “ Fall on us ! ”
NCV	Hosea	10	9	“ Israel , you have sinned since the time of Gibeah , [ a ] and the people there have continued sinning . But war will surely overwhelm them in Gibeah , because of the evil they have done there .
NCV	Hosea	10	11	Israel is like a well-trained young cow that likes to thresh grain . I will put a yoke on her neck and make her work hard in the field . Israel will plow , and Judah will break up the ground .
NCV	Hosea	10	12	I said , ‘ Plant goodness , harvest the fruit of loyalty , plow the new ground of knowledge . Look for the Lord until he comes and pours goodness on you like water. ’
NCV	Hosea	10	13	But you have plowed evil and harvested trouble ; you have eaten the fruit of your lies . Because you have trusted in your own power and your many soldiers ,
NCV	Hosea	10	14	your people will hear the noise of battle , and all your strong , walled cities will be destroyed . It will be like the time King Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in battle , when mothers and their children were bashed to death .

NCV	Hosea	11	2	But when I called the people of Israel , they went away from me . They offered sacrifices to the Baals and burned incense to the idols .
NCV	Hosea	11	3	It was I who taught Israel to walk , and I took them by the arms , but they did not understand that I had healed them .
NCV	Hosea	11	4	I led them with cords of human kindness , with ropes of love . I lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down and fed them .

NCV	Hosea	11	9	I won ’ t punish you in my anger , and I won ’ t destroy Israel again . I am God and not a human ; I am the Holy One , and I am among you . I will not come against you in anger .

NCV	Hosea	12	12	Your ancestor Jacob fled to Northwest Mesopotamia where he worked to get a wife ; he tended sheep to pay for her .
NCV	Hosea	12	2	The Lord also has some things against Judah . He will punish Israel for what they have done ; he will give them what they deserve .
NCV	Hosea	12	3	Their ancestor Jacob held on to his brother ’ s heel while the two of them were being born . When he grew to be a man , he wrestled with God .
NCV	Hosea	12	4	When Jacob wrestled with the angel and won , he cried and asked for his blessing . Later , God met with him at Bethel and spoke with him there .
NCV	Hosea	12	5	It was the Lord God All-Powerful ; the Lord is his great name .
NCV	Hosea	12	6	You must return to your God ; love him , do what is just , and always trust in him as your God .
NCV	Hosea	12	7	The merchants use dishonest scales ; they like to cheat people .
NCV	Hosea	12	8	Israel said , “ I am rich ! I am someone with power ! ” All their money will do them no good because of the sins they have done .
NCV	Hosea	12	9	“ But I am the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt . I will make you live in tents again as you used to do on worship days .
NCV	Hosea	12	10	I spoke to the prophets and gave them many visions ; through them , I taught my lessons to you. ”
NCV	Hosea	12	11	The people of Gilead are evil , worth nothing . Though people sacrifice bulls at Gilgal , their altars will become like piles of stone in a plowed field .
NCV	Hosea	12	13	Later the Lord used a prophet to bring Jacob ’ s descendants out of Egypt ; he used a prophet to take care of the Israelites .

NCV	Hosea	13	2	But they still keep on sinning more and more . They make idols of their silver , idols that are cleverly made , the work of a craftsman . Yet the people of Israel say to each other , “ Kiss those calf idols and sacrifice to them. ”
NCV	Hosea	13	3	So those people will be like the morning mist ; they will disappear like the morning dew . They will be like chaff blown from the threshing floor , like smoke going out a window .
NCV	Hosea	13	4	“ I , the Lord , have been your God since you were in the land of Egypt . You should have known no other God except me . I am the only one who saves .
NCV	Hosea	13	5	I cared for them in the desert where it was hot and dry .
NCV	Hosea	13	6	I gave them food , and they became full and satisfied . But then they became too proud and forgot me .
NCV	Hosea	13	7	That is why I will be like a lion to them , like a leopard waiting by the road .
NCV	Hosea	13	8	I will attack like a bear robbed of her cubs , ripping their bodies open . I will devour them like a lion and tear them apart like a wild animal .
NCV	Hosea	13	9	“ Israel , I will destroy you . Who will be your helper then ?
NCV	Hosea	13	10	What good is your king ? Can he save you in any of your towns ? What good are your leaders ? You said , ‘ Give us a king and leaders. ’
NCV	Hosea	13	11	So I gave you a king , but only in anger , and I took him away in my great anger .
NCV	Hosea	13	12	The sins of Israel are on record , stored away , waiting for punishment .
NCV	Hosea	13	14	Will I save them from the place of the dead ? Will I rescue them from death ? Where is your sickness , death ? Where is your pain , place of death ? I will show them no mercy .
NCV	Hosea	13	15	Israel is doing well among the nations , but the Lord will send a wind from the east , coming from the desert , that will dry up his springs and wells of water . He will destroy from their treasure houses everything of value .

NCV	Joel	1	8	Cry as a young woman cries when the man she was going to marry has died .
NCV	Joel	1	9	There will be no more grain or drink offerings to offer in the Temple of the Lord . Because of this , the priests , the servants of the Lord , are sad .

NCV	Joel	1	18	The animals are groaning ! The herds of cattle wander around confused , because they have no grass to eat ; even the flocks of sheep suffer .
NCV	Joel	1	19	Lord , I am calling to you for help , because fire has burned up the open pastures , and flames have burned all the trees in the field .

NCV	Joel	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Joel	2	2	It will be a dark , gloomy day , cloudy and black . Like the light at sunrise , a great and powerful army will spread over the mountains . There has never been anything like it before , and there will never be anything like it again .
NCV	Joel	2	3	In front of them a fire destroys ; in back of them a flame burns . The land in front of them is like the garden of Eden ; the land behind them is like an empty desert . Nothing will escape from them .
NCV	Joel	2	4	They look like horses , and they run like war horses .
NCV	Joel	2	5	It is like the noise of chariots rumbling over the tops of the mountains , like the noise of a roaring fire burning dry stalks . They are like a powerful army lined up for battle .
NCV	Joel	2	6	When they see them , nations shake with fear , and everyone ’ s face becomes pale .
NCV	Joel	2	7	They charge like soldiers ; they climb over the wall like warriors . They all march straight ahead and do not move off their path .
NCV	Joel	2	8	They do not run into each other , because each walks in line . They break through all efforts to stop them and keep coming .
NCV	Joel	2	9	They run into the city . They run at the wall and climb into the houses , entering through windows like thieves .
NCV	Joel	2	10	Before them , earth and sky shake . The sun and the moon become dark , and the stars stop shining .
NCV	Joel	2	11	The Lord shouts out orders to his army . His army is very large ! Those who obey him are very strong ! The Lord ’ s day of judging is an overwhelming and terrible day . No one can stand up against it ! Change Your Hearts
NCV	Joel	2	12	The Lord says , “ Even now , come back to me with all your heart . Fast , cry , and be sad. ”
NCV	Joel	2	13	Tearing your clothes is not enough to show you are sad ; let your heart be broken . Come back to the Lord your God , because he is kind and shows mercy . He doesn ’ t become angry quickly , and he has great love . He can change his mind about doing harm .
NCV	Joel	2	14	Who knows ? Maybe he will turn back to you and leave behind a blessing for you . Grain and drink offerings belong to the Lord your God .
NCV	Joel	2	15	Blow the trumpet in Jerusalem ; call for a day when everyone fasts . Tell everyone to stop work .
NCV	Joel	2	16	Bring the people together and make the meeting holy for the Lord . Bring together the elders , as well as the children , and even babies that still feed at their mothers ’ breasts . The bridegroom should come from his room , the bride from her bedroom .
NCV	Joel	2	17	The priests , the Lord ’ s servants , should cry between the altar and the entrance to the Temple . They should say , “ Lord , have mercy on your people . Don ’ t let them be put to shame ; don ’ t let other nations make fun of them . Don ’ t let people in other nations ask , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ” The Lord Restores the Land
NCV	Joel	2	18	Then the Lord became concerned about his land and felt sorry for his people .
NCV	Joel	2	19	He said to them : “ I will send you grain , new wine , and olive oil , so that you will have plenty . No more will I shame you among the nations .
NCV	Joel	2	20	I will force the army from the north to leave your land and go into a dry , empty land . Their soldiers in front will be forced into the Dead Sea , and those in the rear into the Mediterranean Sea . Their bodies will rot and stink . The Lord has surely done a wonderful thing ! ”
NCV	Joel	2	21	Land , don ’ t be afraid ; be happy and full of joy , because the Lord has done a wonderful thing .
NCV	Joel	2	22	Wild animals , don ’ t be afraid , because the open pastures have grown grass . The trees have given fruit ; the fig trees and the grapevines have grown much fruit .
NCV	Joel	2	23	So be happy , people of Jerusalem ; be joyful in the Lord your God . Because he does what is right , he has brought you rain ; he has sent the fall rain and the spring rain for you , as before .
NCV	Joel	2	24	And the threshing floors will be full of grain ; the barrels will overflow with new wine and olive oil . The Lord Speaks
NCV	Joel	2	25	“ Though I sent my great army against you— those swarming locusts and hopping locusts , the destroying locusts and the cutting locusts [ a ] that ate your crops— I will pay you back for those years of trouble .
NCV	Joel	2	26	Then you will have plenty to eat and be full . You will praise the name of the Lord your God , who has done miracles for you . My people will never again be shamed .
NCV	Joel	2	27	Then you will know that I am among the people of Israel , that I am the Lord your God , and there is no other God . My people will never be shamed again .
NCV	Joel	2	28	“ After this , I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people . Your sons and daughters will prophesy , your old men will dream dreams , and your young men will see visions .
NCV	Joel	2	29	At that time I will pour out my Spirit also on male slaves and female slaves .
NCV	Joel	2	30	I will show miracles in the sky and on the earth : blood , fire , and thick smoke .
NCV	Joel	2	31	The sun will become dark , the moon red as blood , before the overwhelming and terrible day of the Lord comes .
NCV	Joel	2	32	Then anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved , because on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be people who will be saved , just as the Lord has said . Those left alive after the day of punishment are the people whom the Lord called . Footnotes - 2:25 swarming . . . locusts These are different names for an insect like a large grasshopper .

NCV	Joel	3	12	“ Wake up , nations , and come to attack in the Valley Where the Lord Judges . There I will sit to judge all the nations on every side .
NCV	Joel	3	13	Swing the cutting tool , because the harvest is ripe . Come , walk on them as you would walk on grapes to get their juice , because the winepress is full and the barrels are spilling over , because these people are so evil ! ”
NCV	Joel	3	14	There are huge numbers of people in the Valley of Decision , [ a ] because the Lord ’ s day of judging is near in the Valley of Decision .
NCV	Joel	3	15	The sun and the moon will become dark , and the stars will stop shining .
NCV	Joel	3	16	The Lord will roar like a lion from Jerusalem ; his loud voice will thunder from that city , and the sky and the earth will shake . But the Lord will be a safe place for his people , a strong place of safety for the people of Israel .
NCV	Joel	3	17	“ Then you will know that I , the Lord your God , live on my holy Mount Zion . Jerusalem will be a holy place , and strangers will never even go through it again . A New Life Promised for Judah
NCV	Joel	3	18	“ On that day wine will drip from the mountains , milk will flow from the hills , and water will run through all the ravines of Judah . A fountain will flow from the Temple of the Lord and give water to the valley of acacia trees .
NCV	Joel	3	19	But Egypt will become empty , and Edom an empty desert , because they were cruel to the people of Judah . They killed innocent people in that land .
NCV	Joel	3	20	But there will always be people living in Judah , and people will live in Jerusalem from now on .

NCV	Amos	5	19	It will be like someone who runs from a lion and meets a bear , or like someone who goes into his house and puts his hand on the wall , and then is bitten by a snake .

NCV	Amos	6	11	The Lord has given the command ; the large house will be broken into pieces , and the small house into bits .

NCV	Amos	7	12	Then Amaziah said to Amos , “ Seer , go back right now to Judah . Do your prophesying and earn your living there ,
NCV	Amos	7	13	but don ’ t prophesy anymore here at Bethel . This is the king ’ s holy place , and it is the nation ’ s temple. ”
NCV	Amos	7	14	Then Amos answered Amaziah , “ I do not make my living as a prophet , nor am I a member of a group of prophets . I make my living as a shepherd , and I take care of sycamore trees .
NCV	Amos	7	15	But the Lord took me away from tending the flock and said to me , ‘ Go , prophesy to my people Israel. ’
NCV	Amos	7	16	So listen to the Lord ’ s word . You tell me , ‘ Don ’ t prophesy against Israel , and stop prophesying against the descendants of Isaac. ’
NCV	Amos	7	17	“ Because you have said this , the Lord says : ‘ Your wife will become a prostitute in the city , and your sons and daughters will be killed with swords . Other people will measure your land and divide it among themselves , and you will die in a foreign country . The people of Israel will definitely be taken from their own land as captives. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Amos	8	8	The whole land will shake because of it , and everyone who lives in the land will cry for those who died . The whole land will rise like the Nile ; it will be shaken , and then it will fall like the Nile River in Egypt. ”
NCV	Amos	8	2	He said to me , “ Amos , what do you see ? ” I said , “ A basket of summer fruit. ” Then the Lord said to me , “ An end [ a ] has come for my people Israel , because I will not overlook their sins anymore .
NCV	Amos	8	3	“ On that day the palace songs will become funeral songs , ” says the Lord God . “ There will be dead bodies thrown everywhere ! Silence ! ”
NCV	Amos	8	4	Listen to me , you who walk on helpless people , you who are trying to destroy the poor people of this country , saying ,
NCV	Amos	8	5	“ When will the New Moon festival be over so we can sell grain ? When will the Sabbath be over so we can bring out wheat to sell ? We can charge them more and give them less , and we can change the scales to cheat the people .
NCV	Amos	8	6	We will buy poor people for silver , and needy people for the price of a pair of sandals . We will even sell the wheat that was swept up from the floor. ”
NCV	Amos	8	7	The Lord has sworn by his name , the Pride of Jacob , “ I will never forget everything that these people did .
NCV	Amos	8	9	The Lord God says : “ At that time I will cause the sun to go down at noon and make the earth dark on a bright day .
NCV	Amos	8	10	I will change your festivals into days of crying for the dead , and all your songs will become songs of sadness . I will make all of you wear rough cloth to show your sadness ; I will make you shave your heads as well . I will make it like a time of crying for the death of an only son , and its end like the end of an awful day. ”
NCV	Amos	8	11	The Lord God says : “ The days are coming when I will cause a time of hunger in the land . The people will not be hungry for bread or thirsty for water , but they will be hungry for words from the Lord .
NCV	Amos	8	12	They will wander from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea , from the north to the east . They will search for the word of the Lord , but they won ’ t find it .
NCV	Amos	8	13	At that time the beautiful young women and the young men will become weak from thirst .
NCV	Amos	8	14	They make promises by the idol in Samaria and say , ‘ As surely as the god of Dan lives . . . ’ and , ‘ As surely as the god of Beersheba [ b ] lives , we promise . . . ’ So they will fall and never get up again. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Amos	9	9	“ I am giving the command to scatter the nation of Israel among all nations . It will be like someone shaking grain through a strainer , but not even a tiny stone falls through .
NCV	Amos	9	2	If they dig down as deep as the place of the dead , I will pull them up from there . If they climb up into heaven , I will bring them down from there .
NCV	Amos	9	3	If they hide at the top of Mount Carmel , I will find them and take them away . If they try to hide from me at the bottom of the sea , I will command a snake to bite them .
NCV	Amos	9	4	If they are captured and taken away by their enemies , I will command the sword to kill them . I will keep watch over them , but I will keep watch to give them trouble , not to do them good. ”
NCV	Amos	9	5	The Lord God All-Powerful touches the land , and the land shakes . Then everyone who lives in the land cries for the dead . The whole land rises like the Nile River and falls like the river of Egypt .
NCV	Amos	9	6	The Lord builds his upper rooms above the skies ; he sets their foundations on the earth . He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the land . The Lord is his name .

NCV	Amos	9	8	I , the Lord God , am watching the sinful kingdom Israel . I will destroy it from off the earth , but I will not completely destroy Jacob ’ s descendants , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Amos	9	10	All the sinners among my people will die by the sword— those who say , ‘ Nothing bad will happen to us. ’ The Lord Promises to Restore Israel
NCV	Amos	9	11	“ The kingdom of David is like a fallen tent , but in that day I will set it up again and mend its broken places . I will rebuild its ruins as it was before .
NCV	Amos	9	12	Then Israel will take over what is left of Edom and the other nations that belong to me , ” says the Lord , who will make it happen .
NCV	Amos	9	13	The Lord says , “ The time is coming when there will be all kinds of food . People will still be harvesting crops when it ’ s time to plow again . People will still be taking the juice from grapes when it ’ s time to plant again . Wine will drip from the mountains and pour from the hills .
NCV	Amos	9	14	I will bring my people Israel back from captivity ; they will build the ruined cities again , and they will live in them . They will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them ; they will plant gardens and eat their fruit .
NCV	Amos	9	15	I will plant my people on their land , and they will not be pulled out again from the land which I have given them , ” says the Lord your God . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Obadiah	1	1	This is the vision of Obadiah . This is what the Lord God says about Edom : [ a ] We have heard a message from the Lord . A messenger has been sent among the nations , saying , “ Attack ! Let ’ s go attack Edom ! ” The Lord Speaks to the Edomites
NCV	Obadiah	1	2	“ Soon I will make you the smallest of nations . You will be greatly hated by everyone .
NCV	Obadiah	1	3	Your pride has fooled you , you who live in the hollow places of the cliff . Your home is up high , you who say to yourself , ‘ No one can bring me down to the ground. ’
NCV	Obadiah	1	4	Even if you fly high like the eagle and make your nest among the stars , I will bring you down from there , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Obadiah	1	5	“ You will really be ruined ! If thieves came to you , if robbers came by night , they would steal only enough for themselves . If workers came and picked the grapes from your vines , they would leave a few behind .
NCV	Obadiah	1	6	But you , Edom , will really lose everything ! People will find all your hidden treasures !
NCV	Obadiah	1	7	All the people who are your friends will force you out of the land . The people who are at peace with you will trick you and defeat you . Those who eat your bread with you now are planning a trap for you , and you will not notice it. ”
NCV	Obadiah	1	8	The Lord says , “ On that day I will surely destroy the wise people from Edom , and those with understanding from the mountains of Edom .
NCV	Obadiah	1	9	Then , city of Teman , your best warriors will be afraid , and everyone from the mountains of Edom will be killed .
NCV	Obadiah	1	10	You did violence to your relatives , the Israelites , so you will be covered with shame and destroyed forever .
NCV	Obadiah	1	11	You stood aside without helping while strangers carried Israel ’ s treasures away . When foreigners entered Israel ’ s city gate and threw lots to decide what part of Jerusalem they would take , you were like one of them . Commands That Edom Broke
NCV	Obadiah	1	12	“ Edom , do not laugh at your brother Israel in his time of trouble or be happy about the people of Judah when they are destroyed . Do not brag when cruel things are done to them .
NCV	Obadiah	1	13	Do not enter the city gate of my people in their time of trouble or laugh at their problems in their time of trouble . Do not take their treasures in their time of trouble .
NCV	Obadiah	1	14	Do not stand at the crossroads to destroy those who are trying to escape . Do not capture those who escape alive and turn them over to their enemy in their time of trouble . The Nations Will Be Judged
NCV	Obadiah	1	15	“ The Lord ’ s day of judging is coming soon to all the nations . The same evil things you did to other people will happen to you ; they will come back upon your own head .
NCV	Obadiah	1	16	Because you drank in my Temple , all the nations will drink on and on . They will drink and drink until they disappear .
NCV	Obadiah	1	17	But on Mount Zion some will escape the judgment , and it will be a holy place . The people of Jacob will take back their land from those who took it from them .
NCV	Obadiah	1	18	The people of Jacob will be like a fire and the people of Joseph [ b ] like a flame . But the people of Esau [ c ] will be like dry stalks . The people of Jacob will set them on fire and burn them up . There will be no one left of the people of Esau. ” This will happen because the Lord has said it .
NCV	Obadiah	1	19	Then God ’ s people will regain southern Judah from Edom ; they will take back the mountains of Edom . They will take back the western hills from the Philistines . They will regain the lands of Ephraim and Samaria , and Benjamin will take over Gilead .
NCV	Obadiah	1	20	People from Israel who once were forced to leave their homes will take the land of the Canaanites , all the way to Zarephath . People from Judah who once were forced to leave Jerusalem and live in Sepharad will take back the cities of southern Judah .
NCV	Obadiah	1	21	Powerful warriors will go up on Mount Zion , where they will rule the people living on Edom ’ s mountains . And the kingdom will belong to the Lord . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Jonah	1	1	The Lord spoke his word to Jonah son of Amittai :
NCV	Jonah	1	2	“ Get up , go to the great city of Nineveh , and preach against it , because I see the evil things they do. ”
NCV	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah got up to run away from the Lord by going to Tarshish . He went to the city of Joppa , where he found a ship that was going to the city of Tarshish . Jonah paid for the trip and went aboard , planning to go to Tarshish to run away from the Lord .
NCV	Jonah	1	4	But the Lord sent a great wind on the sea , which made the sea so stormy that the ship was in danger of breaking apart .
NCV	Jonah	1	5	The sailors were afraid , and each man cried to his own god . They began throwing the cargo from the ship into the sea to make the ship lighter . But Jonah had gone down far inside the ship to lie down , and he fell fast asleep .
NCV	Jonah	1	6	The captain of the ship came and said , “ Why are you sleeping ? Get up and pray to your god ! Maybe your god will pay attention to us , and we won ’ t die ! ”
NCV	Jonah	1	7	Then the men said to each other , “ Let ’ s throw lots to see who caused these troubles to happen to us. ” When they threw lots , the lot showed that the trouble had happened because of Jonah .
NCV	Jonah	1	8	Then they said to him , “ Tell us , who caused our trouble ? What is your job ? Where do you come from ? What is your country ? Who are your people ? ”
NCV	Jonah	1	9	Then Jonah said to them , “ I am a Hebrew . I fear the Lord , the God of heaven , who made the sea and the land. ”
NCV	Jonah	1	10	The men were very afraid , and they asked Jonah , “ What terrible thing did you do ? ” ( They knew he was running away from the Lord because he had told them . )
NCV	Jonah	1	11	Since the wind and the waves of the sea were becoming much stronger , they said to him , “ What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us ? ”
NCV	Jonah	1	12	Jonah said to them , “ Pick me up , and throw me into the sea , and then it will calm down . I know it is my fault that this great storm has come on you. ”
NCV	Jonah	1	13	Instead , the men tried to row the ship back to the land , but they could not , because the sea was becoming more stormy . Jonah ’ s Punishment
NCV	Jonah	1	14	So the men cried to the Lord , “ Lord , please don ’ t let us die because of this man ’ s life ; please don ’ t think we are guilty of killing an innocent person . Lord , you have caused all this to happen ; you wanted it this way. ”
NCV	Jonah	1	15	So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea , and the sea became calm .
NCV	Jonah	1	16	Then they began to fear the Lord very much ; they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made promises to him .

NCV	Jonah	2	2	“ When I was in danger , I called to the Lord , and he answered me . I was about to die , so I cried to you , and you heard my voice .
NCV	Jonah	2	3	You threw me into the sea , down , down into the deep sea . The water was all around me , and your powerful waves flowed over me .
NCV	Jonah	2	4	I said , ‘ I was driven out of your presence , but I hope to see your Holy Temple again. ’
NCV	Jonah	2	5	The waters of the sea closed around my throat . The deep sea was all around me ; seaweed was wrapped around my head .
NCV	Jonah	2	6	When I went down to where the mountains of the sea start to rise , I thought I was locked in this prison forever , but you saved me from the pit of death , Lord my God .
NCV	Jonah	2	7	“ When my life had almost gone , I remembered the Lord . I prayed to you , and you heard my prayers in your Holy Temple .
NCV	Jonah	2	8	“ People who worship useless idols give up their loyalty to you .
NCV	Jonah	2	9	But I will praise and thank you while I give sacrifices to you , and I will keep my promises to you . Salvation comes from the Lord ! ”

NCV	Jonah	3	3	So Jonah obeyed the Lord and got up and went to Nineveh . It was a very large city ; just to walk across it took a person three days .
NCV	Jonah	3	2	“ Get up , go to the great city Nineveh , and preach to it what I tell you to say. ”
NCV	Jonah	3	4	After Jonah had entered the city and walked for one day , he preached to the people , saying , “ After forty days , Nineveh will be destroyed ! ”
NCV	Jonah	3	5	The people of Nineveh believed God . They announced that they would fast for a while , and they put on rough cloth to show their sadness . All the people in the city did this , from the most important to the least important .
NCV	Jonah	3	6	When the king of Nineveh heard this news , he got up from his throne , took off his robe , and covered himself with rough cloth and sat in ashes to show how upset he was .
NCV	Jonah	3	7	He sent this announcement through Nineveh : By command of the king and his important men : No person or animal , herd or flock , will be allowed to taste anything . Do not let them eat food or drink water .
NCV	Jonah	3	8	But every person and animal should be covered with rough cloth , and people should cry loudly to God . Everyone must turn away from evil living and stop doing harm all the time .
NCV	Jonah	3	9	Who knows ? Maybe God will change his mind . Maybe he will stop being angry , and then we will not die .
NCV	Jonah	3	10	When God saw what the people did , that they stopped doing evil , he changed his mind and did not do what he had warned . He did not punish them . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©
NCV	Jonah	3	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Jonah	4	4	Then the Lord said , “ Do you think it is right for you to be angry ? ”
NCV	Jonah	4	2	He prayed to the Lord , “ When I was still in my own country this is what I said would happen , and that is why I quickly ran away to Tarshish . I knew that you are a God who is kind and shows mercy . You don ’ t become angry quickly , and you have great love . I knew you would choose not to cause harm .
NCV	Jonah	4	3	So now I ask you , Lord , please kill me . It is better for me to die than to live. ”
NCV	Jonah	4	5	Jonah went out and sat down east of the city . There he made a shelter for himself and sat in the shade , waiting to see what would happen to the city .
NCV	Jonah	4	6	The Lord made a plant grow quickly up over Jonah , which gave him shade and helped him to be more comfortable . Jonah was very pleased to have the plant .
NCV	Jonah	4	7	But the next day when the sun rose , God sent a worm to attack the plant so that it died .
NCV	Jonah	4	8	As the sun rose higher in the sky , God sent a very hot east wind to blow , and the sun became so hot on Jonah ’ s head that he became very weak and wished he were dead . He said , “ It is better for me to die than to live. ”
NCV	Jonah	4	9	But God said to Jonah , “ Do you think it is right for you to be angry about the plant ? ” Jonah answered , “ It is right for me to be angry ! I am so angry I could die ! ”
NCV	Jonah	4	10	And the Lord said , “ You are so concerned for that plant even though you did nothing to make it grow . It appeared one day , and the next day it died .
NCV	Jonah	4	11	Then shouldn ’ t I show concern for the great city Nineveh , which has more than one hundred twenty thousand people who do not know right from wrong , and many animals , too ? ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Micah	1	1	During the time that Jotham , Ahaz , and Hezekiah were kings of Judah , the word of the Lord came to Micah , who was from Moresheth . He saw these visions about Samaria and Jerusalem .
NCV	Micah	1	2	Hear this , all you nations ; listen , earth and all you who live on it . The Lord God will be a witness against you , the Lord from his Holy Temple .
NCV	Micah	1	3	See , the Lord is coming out of his place ; he is coming down to walk on the tops of the mountains .
NCV	Micah	1	4	The mountains will melt under him , and the valleys will crack open , like wax near a fire , like water running down a hillside .
NCV	Micah	1	5	All this is because of Jacob ’ s sin , because of the sins of the nation of Israel . What is the place of Jacob ’ s sin ? Isn ’ t it Samaria ? What is Judah ’ s place of idol worship ? Isn ’ t it Jerusalem ? The Lord Speaks
NCV	Micah	1	6	“ So I will make Samaria a pile of ruins in the open country , a place for planting vineyards . I will pour her stones down into the valley and strip her down to her foundations .
NCV	Micah	1	7	All her idols will be broken into pieces ; all the gifts to her idols will be burned with fire . I will destroy all her idols , and because Samaria earned her money by being unfaithful to me , this money will be carried off by others who are not faithful to me. ” Micah ’ s Great Sadness
NCV	Micah	1	8	I will moan and cry because of this evil , going around barefoot and naked . I will cry loudly like the wild dogs and make sad sounds like the owls do ,
NCV	Micah	1	9	because Samaria ’ s wound can not be healed . It will spread to Judah ; it will reach the city gate of my people , all the way to Jerusalem .
NCV	Micah	1	10	Don ’ t tell it in Gath . [ a ] Don ’ t cry in Acco . [ b ] Roll in the dust at Beth Ophrah . [ c ]
NCV	Micah	1	11	Pass on your way , naked and ashamed , you who live in Shaphir . [ d ] Those who live in Zaanan [ e ] won ’ t come out . The people in Beth Ezel [ f ] will cry , but they will not give you any support .
NCV	Micah	1	12	Those who live in Maroth [ g ] will be anxious for good news to come , because trouble will come from the Lord , all the way to the gate of Jerusalem .
NCV	Micah	1	13	You people living in Lachish , [ h ] harness the fastest horse to the chariot . Jerusalem ’ s sins started in you ; yes , Israel ’ s sins were found in you .
NCV	Micah	1	14	So you must give farewell gifts to Moresheth [ i ] in Gath . The houses in Aczib [ j ] will be false help to the kings of Israel .
NCV	Micah	1	15	I will bring against you people who will take your land , you who live in Mareshah . [ k ] The glory of Israel will go in to Adullam .

NCV	Micah	2	2	They want fields , so they take them ; they want houses , so they take them away . They cheat people to get their houses ; they rob them even of their property .
NCV	Micah	2	3	That is why the Lord says : “ Look , I am planning trouble against such people , and you won ’ t be able to save yourselves . You will no longer walk proudly , because it will be a terrible time .
NCV	Micah	2	4	At that time people will make fun of you and sing this sad song about you : ‘ We are completely ruined ; the Lord has taken away my people ’ s land . Yes , he has taken it away from me and divided our fields among our enemies ! ’ ”
NCV	Micah	2	5	So you will have no one from the Lord ’ s people to throw lots to divide the land . Micah Is Asked Not to Prophesy
NCV	Micah	2	6	The prophets say , “ Don ’ t prophesy to us ! Don ’ t prophesy about these things ! Nothing to make us feel bad will happen ! ”
NCV	Micah	2	7	But I must say this , people of Jacob : The Lord is becoming angry about what you have done . My words are welcome to the person who does what is right .
NCV	Micah	2	8	But you are fighting against my people like an enemy . You take the coats from people who pass by ; you rob them of their safety ; you plan war .
NCV	Micah	2	9	You ’ ve forced the women of my people from their nice houses ; you ’ ve taken my glory from their children forever .
NCV	Micah	2	10	Get up and leave . This is not your place of rest anymore . You have made this place unclean , and it is doomed to destruction .
NCV	Micah	2	11	But you people want a false prophet who will tell you nothing but lies . You want one who promises to prophesy good things for you if you give him wine and beer . He ’ s just the prophet for you . The Lord Promises to Rescue His People
NCV	Micah	2	12	“ Yes , people of Jacob , I will bring all of you together ; I will bring together all those left alive in Israel . I will put them together like sheep in a pen , like a flock in its pasture ; the place will be filled with many people .
NCV	Micah	2	13	Someone will open the way and lead the people out . The people will break through the gate and leave the city where they were held captive . Their king will go out in front of them , and the Lord will lead them. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Micah	3	3	You eat my people ’ s flesh and skin them and break their bones ; you chop them up like meat for the pot , like meat in a cooking pan .
NCV	Micah	3	2	but you hate good and love evil . You skin my people alive and tear the flesh off their bones .
NCV	Micah	3	4	They will cry to the Lord , but he won ’ t answer them . At that time he will hide his face from them , because what they have done is evil. ”
NCV	Micah	3	5	The Lord says this about the prophets who teach his people the wrong way of living : “ If these prophets are given food to eat , they shout , ‘ Peace ! ’ But if someone doesn ’ t give them what they ask for , they call for a holy war against that person .
NCV	Micah	3	6	So it will become like night for them , without visions . It will become dark for them , without any way to tell the future . The sun is about to set for the prophets ; their day will become dark .
NCV	Micah	3	7	The seers will be ashamed ; the people who see the future will be embarrassed . Yes , all of them will cover their mouths , because there will be no answer from God. ” Micah Is an Honest Prophet of God
NCV	Micah	3	8	But I am filled with power , with the Spirit of the Lord , and with justice and strength , to tell the people of Jacob how they have turned against God , and the people of Israel how they have sinned .
NCV	Micah	3	9	Leaders of Jacob and rulers of Israel , listen to me , you who hate fairness and twist what is right .
NCV	Micah	3	10	You build Jerusalem by murdering people ; you build it with evil .
NCV	Micah	3	11	Its judges take money to decide who wins in court . Its priests only teach for pay , and its prophets only look into the future when they get paid . But they lean on the Lord and say , “ The Lord is here with us , so nothing bad will happen to us. ”

NCV	Micah	4	2	Many nations will come and say , “ Come , let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the Temple of the God of Jacob , so that he can teach us his ways , and we can obey his teachings. ” His teachings will go out from Jerusalem , the word of the Lord from that city .
NCV	Micah	4	3	The Lord will judge many nations ; he will make decisions about strong nations that are far away . They will hammer their swords into plow blades and their spears into hooks for trimming trees . Nations will no longer raise swords against other nations ; they will not train for war anymore .
NCV	Micah	4	5	All other nations may follow their own gods , but we will follow the Lord our God forever and ever .
NCV	Micah	4	6	The Lord says , “ At that time , I will gather the crippled ; I will bring together those who were sent away , those whom I caused to have trouble .
NCV	Micah	4	7	I will keep alive those who were crippled , and I will make a strong nation of those who were sent away . The Lord will be their king in Mount Zion from now on and forever .

NCV	Micah	4	9	Now , why do you cry so loudly ? Is your king gone ? Have you lost your helper , so that you are in pain , like a woman trying to give birth ?
NCV	Micah	4	10	People of Jerusalem , strain and be in pain . Be like a woman trying to give birth , because now you must leave the city and live in the field . You will go to Babylon , but you will be saved from that place . The Lord will go there and buy you back from your enemies .
NCV	Micah	4	11	But now many nations have come to fight against you , saying , “ Let ’ s destroy Jerusalem . We will look at her and be glad we have defeated her. ”
NCV	Micah	4	12	But they don ’ t know what the Lord is thinking ; they don ’ t understand his plan . He has gathered them like bundles of grain to the threshing floor .
NCV	Micah	4	13	“ Get up and beat them , people of Jerusalem . I will make you strong as if you had horns of iron and hoofs of bronze .

NCV	Micah	5	5	He will bring peace . Rescue and Punishment Assyria will surely come into our country and walk over our large buildings . We will set up seven shepherds , eight leaders of the people .
NCV	Micah	5	2	“ But you , Bethlehem Ephrathah , though you are too small to be among the army groups from Judah , from you will come one who will rule Israel for me . He comes from very old times , from days long ago. ”
NCV	Micah	5	3	The Lord will give up his people until the one who is having a baby gives birth ; then the rest of his relatives will return to the people of Israel .
NCV	Micah	5	4	At that time the ruler of Israel will stand and take care of his people with the Lord ’ s strength and with the power of the name of the Lord his God . The Israelites will live in safety , because his greatness will reach all over the earth .
NCV	Micah	5	6	They will destroy the Assyrians with their swords ; they will conquer the land of Assyria with their swords drawn . They will rescue us from the Assyrians when they come into our land , when they walk over our borders .
NCV	Micah	5	7	Then the people of Jacob who are left alive will be to other people like dew from the Lord or rain on the grass— it does not wait for human beings ; it does not pause for any person .
NCV	Micah	5	8	Those of Jacob ’ s people who are left alive will be scattered among many nations and peoples . They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest , like a young lion in a flock of sheep : As it goes , it jumps on them and tears them to pieces , and no one can save them .
NCV	Micah	5	9	So you will raise your fist in victory over your enemies , and all your enemies will be destroyed .
NCV	Micah	5	10	The Lord says , “ At that time , I will take your horses from you and destroy your chariots .

NCV	Micah	6	6	You say , “ What can I bring with me when I come before the Lord , when I bow before God on high ? Should I come before him with burnt offerings , with year-old calves ?
NCV	Micah	6	2	Mountains , listen to the Lord ’ s legal case . Foundations of the earth , listen . The Lord has a legal case against his people , and he will accuse Israel. ”
NCV	Micah	6	3	He says , “ My people , what did I do to you ? How did I make you tired of me ? Tell me .
NCV	Micah	6	4	I brought you from the land of Egypt and freed you from slavery ; I sent Moses , Aaron , and Miriam to you .
NCV	Micah	6	5	My people , remember the evil plans of Balak king of Moab and what Balaam son of Beor told Balak . Remember what happened from Acacia to Gilgal so that you will know the Lord does what is right ! ”
NCV	Micah	6	7	Will the Lord be pleased with a thousand male sheep ? Will he be pleased with ten thousand rivers of oil ? Should I give my first child for the evil I have done ? Should I give my very own child for my sin ? ”
NCV	Micah	6	8	The Lord has told you , human , what is good ; he has told you what he wants from you : to do what is right to other people , love being kind to others , and live humbly , obeying your God .
NCV	Micah	6	9	The voice of the Lord calls to the city , and the wise person honors him . So pay attention to the rod of punishment ; pay attention to the One who threatens to punish .
NCV	Micah	6	10	Are there still in the wicked house wicked treasures and the cursed false measure ?
NCV	Micah	6	11	Can I forgive people who cheat others with wrong weights and scales ?
NCV	Micah	6	12	The rich people of the city do cruel things . Its people tell lies ; they do not tell the truth .
NCV	Micah	6	13	As for me , I will make you sick . I will attack you , ruining you because of your sins .
NCV	Micah	6	14	You will eat , but you won ’ t become full ; you will still be hungry and empty . You will store up , but save nothing , and what you store up , the sword will destroy .
NCV	Micah	6	15	You will plant , but you won ’ t harvest . You will step on your olives , but you won ’ t get any oil from them . You will crush the grapes , but you will not drink the new wine .
NCV	Micah	6	16	This is because you obey the laws of King Omri and do all the things that Ahab ’ s family does ; you follow their advice . So I will let you be destroyed . The people in your city will be laughed at , and other nations will make fun of you . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Micah	7	7	Israel says , “ I will look to the Lord for help . I will wait for God to save me ; my God will hear me .
NCV	Micah	7	2	All of the faithful people are gone ; there is not one good person left in this country . Everyone is waiting to kill someone ; everyone is trying to trap someone else .
NCV	Micah	7	3	With both hands they are doing evil . Rulers ask for money , and judges ’ decisions are bought for a price . Rich people tell what they want , and they get it .
NCV	Micah	7	4	Even the best of them is like a thornbush ; the most honest of them is worse than a prickly plant . The day that your watchmen [ a ] warned you about has come . Now they will be confused .
NCV	Micah	7	5	Don ’ t believe your neighbor or trust a friend . Don ’ t say anything , even to your wife .
NCV	Micah	7	6	A son will not honor his father , a daughter will turn against her mother , and a daughter-in-law will be against her mother-in-law ; a person ’ s enemies will be members of his own family . The Lord ’ s Kindness
NCV	Micah	7	8	Enemy , don ’ t laugh at me . I have fallen , but I will get up again . I sit in the shadow of trouble now , but the Lord will be a light for me .
NCV	Micah	7	9	I sinned against the Lord , so he was angry with me , but he will defend my case in court . He will bring about what is right for me . Then he will bring me out into the light , and I will see him set things right .
NCV	Micah	7	10	Then my enemies will see this , and they will be ashamed , those who said to me , ‘ Where is the Lord your God ? ’ I will look down on them . They will get walked on , like mud in the street. ” Israel Will Return
NCV	Micah	7	11	The time will come when your walls will be built again , when your country will grow .
NCV	Micah	7	12	At that time your people will come back to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt to the Euphrates River , and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain .
NCV	Micah	7	13	The earth will be ruined for the people who live in it because of their deeds . A Prayer to God
NCV	Micah	7	14	So shepherd your people with your stick ; tend the flock of people who belong to you . That flock now lives alone in the forest in the middle of a garden land . Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead as in days long ago .
NCV	Micah	7	15	“ As in the days when I brought you out of Egypt , I will show them miracles. ”
NCV	Micah	7	16	When the nations see those miracles , they will no longer brag about their power . They will put their hands over their mouths , refusing to listen .
NCV	Micah	7	17	They will crawl in the dust like a snake , like insects crawling on the ground . They will come trembling from their holes to the Lord our God and will turn in fear before you .
NCV	Micah	7	18	There is no God like you . You forgive those who are guilty of sin ; you don ’ t look at the sins of your people who are left alive . You will not stay angry forever , because you enjoy being kind .
NCV	Micah	7	19	You will have mercy on us again ; you will conquer our sins . You will throw away all our sins into the deepest part of the sea .
NCV	Micah	7	20	You will be true to the people of Jacob , and you will be kind to the people of Abraham as you promised to our ancestors long ago . Footnotes - 7:4 watchmen Another name for prophets .

NCV	Nahum	1	1	This is the message for the city of Nineveh . [ a ] This is the book of the vision of Nahum , who was from the town of Elkosh . The Lord Is Angry with Nineveh
NCV	Nahum	1	2	The Lord is a jealous God who punishes ; the Lord punishes and is filled with anger . The Lord punishes those who are against him , and he stays angry with his enemies .
NCV	Nahum	1	3	The Lord does not become angry quickly , and his power is great . The Lord will not let the guilty go unpunished . Where the Lord goes , there are whirlwinds and storms , and the clouds are the dust beneath his feet .
NCV	Nahum	1	4	He speaks to the sea and makes it dry ; he dries up all the rivers . The areas of Bashan and Carmel dry up , and the flowers of Lebanon dry up .
NCV	Nahum	1	5	The mountains shake in front of him , and the hills melt . The earth trembles when he comes ; the world and all who live in it shake with fear .
NCV	Nahum	1	6	No one can stay alive when he is angry ; no one can survive his strong anger . His anger is poured out like fire ; the rocks are smashed by him .
NCV	Nahum	1	7	The Lord is good , giving protection in times of trouble . He knows who trusts in him .
NCV	Nahum	1	8	But like a rushing flood , he will completely destroy Nineveh ; he will chase his enemies until he kills them .
NCV	Nahum	1	9	The Lord will completely destroy anyone making plans against him . Trouble will not come a second time .
NCV	Nahum	1	10	Those people will be like tangled thorns or like people drunk from their wine ; they will be burned up quickly like dry weeds .
NCV	Nahum	1	11	Someone has come from Nineveh who makes evil plans against the Lord and gives wicked advice .
NCV	Nahum	1	12	This is what the Lord says : “ Although Assyria is strong and has many people , it will be defeated and brought to an end . Although I have made you suffer , Judah , I will make you suffer no more .
NCV	Nahum	1	13	Now I will free you from their control and tear away your chains. ”
NCV	Nahum	1	14	The Lord has given you this command , Nineveh : “ You will not have descendants to carry on your name . I will destroy the idols and metal images that are in the temple of your gods . I will make a grave for you , because you are wicked. ”
NCV	Nahum	1	15	Look , there on the hills , someone is bringing good news ! He is announcing peace ! Celebrate your feasts , people of Judah , and give your promised sacrifices to God . The wicked will not come to attack you again ; they have been completely destroyed . Footnotes - 1:1 Nineveh The capital city of the country of Assyria .

NCV	Nahum	2	2	Destroyers have destroyed God ’ s people and ruined their vines , but the Lord will bring back Jacob ’ s greatness like Israel ’ s greatness .
NCV	Nahum	2	3	The shields of his soldiers are red ; the army is dressed in red . The metal on the chariots flashes like fire when they are ready to attack ; their horses are excited .
NCV	Nahum	2	4	The chariots race through the streets and rush back and forth through the city squares . They look like torches ; they run like lightning .
NCV	Nahum	2	5	He [ b ] calls his officers , but they stumble on the way . They hurry to the city wall , and the shield is put into place .
NCV	Nahum	2	6	The river gates are thrown open , and the palace is destroyed .
NCV	Nahum	2	7	It has been announced that the people of Nineveh will be captured and carried away . The slave girls moan like doves and beat their breasts , because they are sad .
NCV	Nahum	2	8	Nineveh is like a pool , and now its water is draining away . “ Stop ! Stop ! ” the people yell , but no one turns back .
NCV	Nahum	2	9	Take the silver ! Take the gold ! There is no end to the treasure— piles of wealth of every kind .
NCV	Nahum	2	10	Nineveh is robbed , ruined , and destroyed . The people lose their courage , and their knees knock . Stomachs ache , and everyone ’ s face grows pale .
NCV	Nahum	2	11	Where is the lions ’ [ c ] den and the place where they feed their young ? Where did the lion , lioness , and cubs go without being afraid ?
NCV	Nahum	2	12	The lion killed enough for his cubs , enough for his mate . He filled his cave with the animals he caught ; he filled his den with meat he had killed .
NCV	Nahum	2	13	“ I am against you , Nineveh , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ I will burn up your chariots in smoke , and the sword will kill your young lions . I will stop you from hunting down others on the earth , and your messengers ’ voices will no longer be heard. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Nahum	3	3	Horses are charging , swords are shining , spears are gleaming ! Many are dead ; their bodies are piled up— too many to count . People stumble over the dead bodies .
NCV	Nahum	3	2	Hear the sound of whips and the noise of the wheels . Hear horses galloping and chariots bouncing along !
NCV	Nahum	3	4	The city was like a prostitute ; she was charming and a lover of magic . She made nations slaves with her prostitution and her witchcraft .
NCV	Nahum	3	5	“ I am against you , Nineveh , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ I will pull your dress up over your face and show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame .
NCV	Nahum	3	6	I will throw filthy garbage on you and make a fool of you . I will make people stare at you .
NCV	Nahum	3	7	Everyone who sees you will run away and say , ‘ Nineveh is in ruins . Who will cry for her ? ’ Nineveh , where will I find anyone to comfort you ? ”
NCV	Nahum	3	8	You are no better than Thebes , [ a ] who sits by the Nile River with water all around her . The river was her defense ; the waters were like a wall around her .
NCV	Nahum	3	9	Cush and Egypt gave her endless strength ; Put and Libya supported her .
NCV	Nahum	3	10	But Thebes was captured and went into captivity . Her small children were beaten to death at every street corner . Lots were thrown for her important men , and all of her leaders were put in chains .
NCV	Nahum	3	11	Nineveh , you will be drunk , too . You will hide ; you will look for a place safe from the enemy .
NCV	Nahum	3	12	All your defenses are like fig trees with ripe fruit . When the tree is shaken , the figs fall into the mouth of the eater .
NCV	Nahum	3	13	Look at your soldiers . They are all women ! The gates of your land are wide open for your enemies ; fire has burned the bars of your gates .
NCV	Nahum	3	14	Get enough water before the long war begins . Make your defenses strong ! Get mud , mix clay , make bricks !
NCV	Nahum	3	15	There the fire will burn you up . The sword will kill you ; like grasshoppers eating crops , the battle will completely destroy you . Grow in number like hopping locusts ; grow in number like swarming locusts !
NCV	Nahum	3	16	Your traders are more than the stars in the sky , but like locusts , they strip the land and then fly away .
NCV	Nahum	3	17	Your guards are like locusts . Your officers are like swarms of locusts that hang on the walls on a cold day . When the sun comes up , they fly away , and no one knows where they have gone .
NCV	Nahum	3	18	King of Assyria , your rulers are asleep ; your important men lie down to rest . Your people have been scattered on the mountains , and there is no one to bring them back .
NCV	Nahum	3	19	Nothing can heal your wound ; your injury will not heal . Everyone who hears about you applauds , because everyone has felt your endless cruelty . Footnotes - 3:8 Thebes A great city in Egypt . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Habakkuk	1	1	This is the message Habakkuk the prophet received . Habakkuk Complains
NCV	Habakkuk	1	2	Lord , how long must I ask for help and you ignore me ? I cry out to you about violence , but you do not save us !
NCV	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do you make me see wrong things and make me look at trouble ? People are destroying things and hurting others in front of me ; they are arguing and fighting .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	4	So the teachings are weak , and justice never comes . Evil people gain while good people lose ; the judges no longer make fair decisions . The Lord Answers
NCV	Habakkuk	1	5	“ Look at the nations ! Watch them and be amazed and shocked . I will do something in your lifetime that you won ’ t believe even when you are told about it .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	6	I will use the Babylonians , those cruel and wild people who march across the earth and take lands that don ’ t belong to them .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	7	They scare and frighten people . They do what they want to do and are good only to themselves .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses are faster than leopards and quicker than wolves at sunset . Their horse soldiers attack quickly ; they come from places far away . They attack quickly , like an eagle swooping down for food .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	9	They all come to fight . Nothing can stop them . Their prisoners are as many as the grains of sand .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	10	They laugh at kings and make fun of rulers . They laugh at all the strong , walled cities and build dirt piles to the top of the walls to capture them .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	11	Then they leave like the wind and move on . They are guilty of worshiping their own strength. ” Habakkuk Complains Again
NCV	Habakkuk	1	12	Lord , you live forever , my God , my holy God . We will not die . Lord , you have chosen the Babylonians to punish people ; our Rock , you picked them to punish .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	13	Your eyes are too good to look at evil ; you can not stand to see those who do wrong . So how can you put up with those evil people ? How can you be quiet when the wicked swallow up people who are better than they are ?
NCV	Habakkuk	1	14	You treat people like fish in the sea , like sea animals without a leader .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	15	The enemy brings them in with hooks . He catches them in his net and drags them in his fishnet . So he rejoices and sings for joy .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	16	The enemy offers sacrifices to his net and burns incense to worship it , because it lets him live like the rich and enjoy the best food .
NCV	Habakkuk	1	17	Will he keep on taking riches with his net ? Will he go on destroying people without showing mercy ? The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Habakkuk	2	2	The Lord answered me : “ Write down the vision ; write it clearly on clay tablets so whoever reads it can run to tell others .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	3	It is not yet time for the message to come true , but that time is coming soon ; the message will come true . It may seem like a long time , but be patient and wait for it , because it will surely come ; it will not be delayed .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	4	The evil nation is very proud of itself ; it is not living as it should . But those who are right with God will live by faith .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	5	“ Just as wine can trick a person , those who are too proud will not last , because their desire is like a grave ’ s desire for death , and like death they always want more . They gather other nations for themselves and collect for themselves all the countries .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	6	But all the nations the Babylonians have hurt will laugh at them . They will make fun of the Babylonians and say , ‘ How terrible it will be for the one that steals many things . How long will that nation get rich by forcing others to pay them ? ’
NCV	Habakkuk	2	7	“ One day the people from whom you have taken money will turn against you . They will realize what is happening and make you shake with fear . Then they will take everything you have .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	8	Because you have stolen from many nations , those who are left will take much from you . This is because you have killed many people , destroying countries and cities and everyone in them .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	9	“ How terrible it will be for the nation that becomes rich by doing wrong , thinking they will live in a safe place and escape harm .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	10	Because you have made plans to destroy many people , you have made your own houses ashamed of you . Because of it , you will lose your lives .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	11	The stones of the walls will cry out against you , and the boards that support the roof will agree that you are wrong .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	12	“ How terrible it will be for the nation that kills people to build a city , that wrongs others to start a town .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	13	The Lord All-Powerful will send fire to destroy what those people have built ; all the nations ’ work will be for nothing .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	14	Then , just as water covers the sea , people everywhere will know the Lord ’ s glory .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	15	“ How terrible for the nation that makes its neighbors drink , pouring from the jug of wine until they are drunk so that it can look at their naked bodies .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	16	You Babylonians will be filled with disgrace , not respect . It ’ s your turn to drink and fall to the ground like a drunk person . The cup of anger from the Lord ’ s right hand is coming around to you . You will receive disgrace , not respect .
NCV	Habakkuk	2	17	You hurt many people in Lebanon , but now you will be hurt . You killed many animals there , and now you must be afraid because of what you did to that land , those cities , and the people who lived in them . The Message About Idols
NCV	Habakkuk	2	18	“ An idol does no good , because a human made it ; it is only a statue that teaches lies . The one who made it expects his own work to help him , but he makes idols that can ’ t even speak !
NCV	Habakkuk	2	19	How terrible it will be for the one who says to a wooden statue , ‘ Come to life ! ’ How terrible it will be for the one who says to a silent stone , ‘ Get up ! ’ It can not tell you what to do . It is only a statue covered with gold and silver ; there is no life in it .

NCV	Habakkuk	3	5	Sickness goes before him , and disease follows behind him .

NCV	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw that the tents of Cushan were in trouble and that the tents of Midian trembled .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	8	Lord , were you angry at the rivers , or were you angry at the streams ? Were you angry with the sea when you rode your horses and chariots of victory ? [ b ]
NCV	Habakkuk	3	9	You uncovered your bow and commanded many arrows to be brought to you . Selah You split the earth with rivers .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw you and shook with fear . The rushing water flowed . The sea made a loud noise , and its waves rose high .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and moon stood still in the sky ; they stopped when they saw the flash of your flying arrows and the gleam of your shining spear .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	12	In anger you marched on the earth ; in anger you punished the nations .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	13	You came out to save your people , to save your chosen one . You crushed the leader of the wicked ones and took everything he had , from head to toe . Selah
NCV	Habakkuk	3	14	With the enemy ’ s own spear you stabbed the leader of his army . His soldiers rushed out like a storm to scatter us . They were happy as they were robbing the poor people in secret .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	15	But you marched through the sea with your horses , stirring the great waters .
NCV	Habakkuk	3	16	I hear these things , and my body trembles ; my lips tremble when I hear the sound . My bones feel weak , and my legs shake . But I will wait patiently for the day of disaster that will come to the people who attack us .

NCV	Zephaniah	2	3	Come to the Lord , all you who are not proud , who obey his laws . Do what is right . Learn to be humble . Maybe you will escape on the day the Lord shows his anger . Philistia Will Be Punished
NCV	Zephaniah	2	4	No one will be left in the city of Gaza , and the city of Ashkelon will be destroyed . Ashdod will be empty by noon , and the people of Ekron will be chased away .
NCV	Zephaniah	2	5	How terrible it will be for you who live by the Mediterranean Sea , you Philistines ! The word of the Lord is against you , Canaan , land of the Philistines . “ I will destroy you so that no one will be left. ”
NCV	Zephaniah	2	6	The land by the Mediterranean Sea , in which you live , will become pastures , fields for shepherds , and pens for sheep .
NCV	Zephaniah	2	7	It will belong to the descendants of Judah who are left alive . There they will let their sheep eat grass . At night they will sleep in the houses of Ashkelon . The Lord their God will pay attention to them and will make their life good again . Moab and Ammon Will Be Punished
NCV	Zephaniah	2	8	“ I have heard the insults of the country of Moab and the threats of the people of Ammon . They have insulted my people and have taken their land. ”
NCV	Zephaniah	2	9	So the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says , “ As surely as I live , Moab will be destroyed like Sodom , and Ammon will be destroyed like Gomorrah [ a ] — a heap of weeds , a pit of salt , and a ruin forever . Those of my people who are left alive will take whatever they want from them ; those who are left from my nation will take their land. ”
NCV	Zephaniah	2	10	This is what Moab and Ammon get for being proud , because they insulted and made fun of the people of the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Zephaniah	2	11	The Lord will frighten them , because he will destroy all the gods of the earth . Then everyone in faraway places will worship him wherever they are . Cush and Assyria Will Be Destroyed
NCV	Zephaniah	2	12	“ You Cushites also will be killed by my sword. ”
NCV	Zephaniah	2	13	Then the Lord will turn against the north and destroy Assyria . He will make Nineveh a ruin as dry as a desert .
NCV	Zephaniah	2	14	Flocks and herds will lie down there , and all wild animals . The owls and crows will sit on the stone pillars . The owl will hoot through the windows , trash will be in the doorways , and the wooden boards of the buildings will be gone .
NCV	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the happy and safe city that thinks there is no one else as strong as it is . But what a ruin it will be , a place where wild animals live . All those who pass by will make fun and shake their fists . Footnotes - 2:9 Sodom . . . Gomorrah Two cities God destroyed because the people were so evil . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Zephaniah	3	3	Its officers are like roaring lions . Its rulers are like hungry wolves that attack in the evening , and in the morning nothing is left of those they attacked .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	2	It obeys no voice ; it can ’ t be taught to do right . It doesn ’ t trust the Lord ; it doesn ’ t worship its God .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	4	Its prophets are proud ; they are people who can not be trusted . Its priests don ’ t respect holy things ; they break God ’ s teachings .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	5	But the Lord is good , and he is there in that city . He does no wrong . Every morning he governs the people fairly ; every day he can be trusted . But evil people are not ashamed of what they do .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	6	“ I have destroyed nations ; their towers were ruined . I made their streets empty so no one goes there anymore . Their cities are ruined ; no one lives there at all .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	7	I said , ‘ Surely now Jerusalem will respect me and will accept my teaching. ’ Then the place where they lived would not be destroyed , and I would not have to punish them . But they were still eager to do evil in everything they did .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	8	Just wait , ” says the Lord . “ Someday I will stand up as a witness . I have decided that I will gather nations and assemble kingdoms . I will pour out my anger on them , all my strong anger . My anger will be like fire that will burn up the whole world . A New Day for God ’ s People
NCV	Zephaniah	3	9	“ Then I will give the people of all nations pure speech so that all of them will speak the name of the Lord and worship me together .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	10	People will come from where the Nile River begins ; my scattered people will come with gifts for me .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	11	Then Jerusalem will not be ashamed of the wrongs done against me , because I will remove from this city those who like to brag ; there will never be any more proud people on my holy mountain in Jerusalem .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	12	But I will leave in the city the humble and those who are not proud , and they will trust in the Lord .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	13	Those who are left alive in Israel won ’ t do wrong or tell lies ; they won ’ t trick people with their words . They will eat and lie down with no one to make them afraid. ” A Happy Song
NCV	Zephaniah	3	14	Sing , Jerusalem . Israel , shout for joy ! Jerusalem , be happy and rejoice with all your heart .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	15	The Lord has stopped punishing you ; he has sent your enemies away . The King of Israel , the Lord , is with you ; you will never again be afraid of being harmed .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	16	On that day Jerusalem will be told , “ Don ’ t be afraid , city of Jerusalem . Don ’ t give up .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	17	The Lord your God is with you ; the mighty One will save you . He will rejoice over you . You will rest in his love ; he will sing and be joyful about you. ”
NCV	Zephaniah	3	18	“ I will take away the sadness planned for you , which would have made you very ashamed .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	19	At that time I will punish all those who harmed you . I will save my people who can not walk and gather my people who have been thrown out . I will give them praise and honor in every place where they were shamed .
NCV	Zephaniah	3	20	At that time I will gather you ; at that time I will bring you back home . I will give you honor and praise from people everywhere when I make things go well again for you , as you will see with your own eyes , ” says the Lord . The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Haggai	1	1	The prophet Haggai spoke the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , the governor of Judah , and to Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest . This message came in the second year that Darius was king , on the first day of the sixth month :
NCV	Haggai	1	2	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ The people say the right time has not come to rebuild the Temple of the Lord. ’ ”
NCV	Haggai	1	3	Then Haggai the prophet spoke the word of the Lord :
NCV	Haggai	1	4	“ Is it right for you to be living in fancy houses while the Temple is still in ruins ? ”
NCV	Haggai	1	5	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Think about what you have done .
NCV	Haggai	1	6	You have planted much , but you harvest little . You eat , but you do not become full . You drink , but you are still thirsty . You put on clothes , but you are not warm enough . You earn money , but then you lose it all as if you had put it into a purse full of holes. ”
NCV	Haggai	1	7	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Think about what you have done .
NCV	Haggai	1	8	Go up to the mountains , bring back wood , and build the Temple . Then I will be pleased with it and be honored , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Haggai	1	9	“ You look for much , but you find little . When you bring it home , I destroy it . Why ? ” asks the Lord All-Powerful . “ Because you all work hard for your own houses while my house is still in ruins !
NCV	Haggai	1	10	Because of what you have done , the sky holds back its rain and the ground holds back its crops .
NCV	Haggai	1	11	I have called for a time without rain on the land , and on the mountains , and on the grain , the new wine , the olive oil , the plants which the earth produces , the people , the farm animals , and all the work of your hands. ”
NCV	Haggai	1	12	Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and all the rest of the people who were left alive obeyed the Lord their God and the message from Haggai the prophet , because the Lord their God had sent him . And the people feared the Lord .
NCV	Haggai	1	13	Haggai , the Lord ’ s messenger , gave the Lord ’ s message to the people , saying , “ The Lord says , ‘ I am with you. ’ ”
NCV	Haggai	1	14	The Lord stirred up Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , the governor of Judah , and Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and all the rest of the people who were left alive . So they came and worked on the Temple of their God , the Lord All-Powerful .

NCV	Haggai	1	2005	by Thomas Nelson , Inc .
NCV	Haggai	2	2	“ Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the rest of the people who are left alive . Say ,
NCV	Haggai	2	3	‘ Do any of you remember how great the Temple was before it was destroyed ? What does it look like now ? Doesn ’ t it seem like nothing to you ? ’
NCV	Haggai	2	4	But the Lord says , ‘ Zerubbabel , be brave . Also , Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , be brave . And all you people who live in the land , be brave , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Work , because I am with you , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Haggai	2	5	‘ I made a promise to you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spirit is still with you . So don ’ t be afraid. ’
NCV	Haggai	2	6	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ In a short time I will once again shake the heavens and the earth , the sea and the dry land .
NCV	Haggai	2	7	I will shake all the nations , and they will bring their wealth . Then I will fill this Temple with glory , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Haggai	2	8	‘ The silver is mine , and the gold is mine , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Haggai	2	9	‘ The new Temple will be greater than the one before , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful . ‘ And in this place I will give peace , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful. ”
NCV	Haggai	2	10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year Darius was king , the Lord spoke his word to Haggai the prophet , saying ,
NCV	Haggai	2	11	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ Ask the priests for a teaching .
NCV	Haggai	2	12	Suppose a person carries in the fold of his clothes some meat made holy for the Lord . If that fold touches bread , cooked food , wine , olive oil , or some other food , will that be made holy ? ’ ” The priests answered , “ No. ”
NCV	Haggai	2	13	Then Haggai said , “ A person who touches a dead body will become unclean . If he touches any of these foods , will it become unclean , too ? ” The priests answered , “ Yes , it would become unclean. ”
NCV	Haggai	2	14	Then Haggai answered , “ The Lord says , ‘ This is also true for the people of this nation . They are unclean , and everything they do with their hands is unclean to me . Whatever they offer at the altar is also unclean .
NCV	Haggai	2	15	“ ‘ Think about this from now on ! Think about how it was before you started laying stones on top of stones to build the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Haggai	2	16	A person used to come to a pile of grain expecting to find twenty basketfuls , but there were only ten . And a person used to come to the wine vat to take out fifty jarfuls , but only twenty were there .
NCV	Haggai	2	17	I destroyed your work with diseases , mildew , and hail , but you still did not come back to me , ’ says the Lord .
NCV	Haggai	2	18	‘ It is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month , the day in which the people finished working on the foundation of the Temple of the Lord . From now on , think about these things :
NCV	Haggai	2	19	Do you have seeds for crops still in the barn ? Your vines , fig trees , pomegranates , and olive trees have not given fruit yet . But from now on I will bless you ! ’ ” The Lord Makes a Promise to Zerubbabel
NCV	Haggai	2	20	Then the Lord spoke his word a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month . He said ,
NCV	Haggai	2	21	“ Tell Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah , ‘ I am going to shake the heavens and the earth .
NCV	Haggai	2	22	I will destroy the foreign kingdoms and take away the power of the kingdoms of the nations . I will destroy the chariots and their riders . The horses will fall with their riders , as people kill each other with swords. ’
NCV	Haggai	2	23	The Lord All-Powerful says , ‘ On that day I will take you , Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , my servant , ’ says the Lord , ‘ and I will make you important like my signet ring , because I have chosen you ! ’ says the Lord All-Powerful. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month of the second year Darius was king , the Lord spoke his word to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah , who was the son of Iddo . The Lord said ,
NCV	Zechariah	1	2	“ The Lord was very angry with your ancestors .
NCV	Zechariah	1	3	So tell the people : This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ Return to me , and I will return to you , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Zechariah	1	4	Don ’ t be like your ancestors . In the past the prophets said to them : This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ Stop your evil ways and evil actions. ’ But they wouldn ’ t listen or pay attention to me , says the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	1	5	Your ancestors are dead , and those prophets didn ’ t live forever .
NCV	Zechariah	1	6	I commanded my words and laws to my servants the prophets , and they preached to your ancestors , who returned to me . They said , ‘ The Lord All-Powerful did as he said he would . He punished us for the way we lived and for what we did. ’ ” The Vision of the Horses
NCV	Zechariah	1	7	It was on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month , which is the month of Shebat , in Darius ’ s second year as king . The Lord spoke his word to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah , who was the son of Iddo .
NCV	Zechariah	1	8	During the night I had a vision . I saw a man riding a red horse . He was standing among some myrtle trees in a ravine , with red , brown , and white horses behind him .
NCV	Zechariah	1	9	I asked , “ What are these , sir ? ” The angel who was talking with me answered , “ I ’ ll show you what they are. ”
NCV	Zechariah	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained , “ They are the ones the Lord sent through all the earth. ”
NCV	Zechariah	1	11	Then they spoke to the Lord ’ s angel , who was standing among the myrtle trees . They said , “ We have gone through all the earth , and everything is calm and quiet. ”
NCV	Zechariah	1	12	Then the Lord ’ s angel asked , “ Lord All-Powerful , how long will it be before you show mercy to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah ? You have been angry with them for seventy years now. ”
NCV	Zechariah	1	13	So the Lord answered the angel who was talking with me , and his words were comforting and good .
NCV	Zechariah	1	14	Then the angel who was talking to me said to me , “ Announce this : This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ I have a strong love for Jerusalem .
NCV	Zechariah	1	15	And I am very angry with the nations that feel so safe . I was only a little angry at them , but they made things worse. ’
NCV	Zechariah	1	16	“ So this is what the Lord says : ‘ I will return to Jerusalem with mercy . My Temple will be rebuilt , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful , ‘ and the measuring line will be used to rebuild Jerusalem. ’
NCV	Zechariah	1	17	“ Also announce : This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ My towns will be rich again . The Lord will comfort Jerusalem again , and I will again choose Jerusalem. ’ ” The Vision of the Horns
NCV	Zechariah	1	18	Then I looked up and saw four animal horns .
NCV	Zechariah	1	19	I asked the angel who was talking with me , “ What are these ? ” He said , “ These are the horns that scattered the people of Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem. ”
NCV	Zechariah	1	20	Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen .
NCV	Zechariah	1	21	I asked , “ What are they coming to do ? ” He answered , “ They have come to scare and throw down the horns . These horns scattered the people of Judah so that no one could even lift up his head . These horns stand for the nations that attacked the people of Judah and scattered them. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	2	2	I asked him , “ Where are you going ? ” He said to me , “ I am going to measure Jerusalem , to see how wide and how long it is. ”
NCV	Zechariah	2	3	Then the angel who was talking with me left , and another angel came out to meet him .
NCV	Zechariah	2	4	The second angel said to him , “ Run and tell that young man , ‘ Jerusalem will become a city without walls , because there will be so many people and cattle in it .
NCV	Zechariah	2	5	I will be a wall of fire around it , ’ says the Lord . ‘ And I will be the glory within it. ’
NCV	Zechariah	2	6	“ Oh no ! Oh no ! Run away from Babylon , because I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	2	7	“ Oh no , Jerusalem ! Escape , you who live right in Babylon. ”
NCV	Zechariah	2	8	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ After he has honored me and sent me against the nations who took your possessions—because whoever touches you hurts what is precious to me—
NCV	Zechariah	2	9	I will shake my hand against them so that their slaves will rob them. ” Then you will know that the Lord All-Powerful sent me .
NCV	Zechariah	2	10	“ Shout and be glad , Jerusalem . I am coming , and I will live among you , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	2	11	“ At that time people from many nations will join with the Lord and will become my people . Then I will live among you , and you will know that the Lord All-Powerful has sent me to you .
NCV	Zechariah	2	12	The Lord will take Judah as his own part of the holy land , and Jerusalem will be his chosen city again .
NCV	Zechariah	2	13	Be silent , everyone , in the presence of the Lord . He is coming out of the holy place where he lives. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	3	3	Joshua was wearing dirty clothes and was standing in front of the angel .
NCV	Zechariah	3	2	The Lord said to Satan , “ The Lord says no to you , Satan ! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem says no to you ! This man was like a burning stick pulled from the fire. ”
NCV	Zechariah	3	4	The angel said to those standing in front of him , “ Take off those dirty clothes. ” Then the angel said to Joshua , “ Look , I have taken away your sin from you , and I am giving you beautiful , fine clothes. ”
NCV	Zechariah	3	5	Then I said , “ Put a clean turban on his head. ” So they put a clean turban on his head and dressed him while the Lord ’ s angel stood there .
NCV	Zechariah	3	6	Then the Lord ’ s angel said to Joshua ,
NCV	Zechariah	3	7	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ If you do as I tell you and serve me , you will be in charge of my Temple and my courtyards . And I will let you be with these angels who are standing here .
NCV	Zechariah	3	8	“ ‘ Listen , Joshua , the high priest , and your friends who are sitting in front of you . They are symbols of what will happen . I am going to bring my servant called the Branch .
NCV	Zechariah	3	9	Look , I put this stone in front of Joshua , a stone with seven sides . I will carve a message on it , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful . ‘ And in one day I will take away the sin of this land. ’
NCV	Zechariah	3	10	“ The Lord All-Powerful says , ‘ In that day , each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your own grapevine and under your own fig tree. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	4	4	I asked the angel who talked with me , “ Sir , what are these ? ”
NCV	Zechariah	4	2	He asked me , “ What do you see ? ” I said , “ I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top . And there are seven lamps and also seven places for wicks .
NCV	Zechariah	4	3	There are two olive trees by it , one on the right of the bowl and the other on the left. ”
NCV	Zechariah	4	5	The angel said , “ Don ’ t you know what they are ? ” “ No , sir , ” I said .
NCV	Zechariah	4	6	Then he told me , “ This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel : ‘ You will not succeed by your own strength or by your own power , but by my Spirit , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Zechariah	4	7	“ Who are you , big mountain ? In front of Zerubbabel you will become flat land , and he will bring out the topmost stone , shouting , ‘ It ’ s beautiful ! It ’ s beautiful ! ’ ”
NCV	Zechariah	4	8	Then the Lord spoke his word to me again , saying ,
NCV	Zechariah	4	9	“ Zerubbabel has laid the foundation of this Temple , and he will complete it . Then you will know that the Lord All-Powerful has sent me to you .
NCV	Zechariah	4	10	“ The people should not think that small beginnings are unimportant . They will be happy when they see Zerubbabel with tools , building the Temple . “ ( These are the seven eyes of the Lord , which look back and forth across the earth . ) ”
NCV	Zechariah	4	11	Then I asked the angel , “ What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand ? ”
NCV	Zechariah	4	12	I also asked him , “ What are the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes , from which the olive oil flows to the lamps ? ”
NCV	Zechariah	4	13	He answered , “ Don ’ t you know what they are ? ” “ No , sir , ” I said .
NCV	Zechariah	4	14	So he said , “ They are symbols of the two who have been appointed to serve the Lord of all the earth. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said to me , “ Look up and see what is going out. ”
NCV	Zechariah	5	2	The angel asked me , “ What do you see ? ” I answered , “ I see a flying scroll , thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide. ”
NCV	Zechariah	5	3	And he said to me , “ This is the curse that will go all over the land . One side says every thief will be taken away . The other side says everyone who makes false promises will be taken away .
NCV	Zechariah	5	4	The Lord All-Powerful says , ‘ I will send it to the houses of thieves and to those who use my name to make false promises . The scroll will stay in that person ’ s house and destroy it with its wood and stones. ’ ” The Vision of the Woman
NCV	Zechariah	5	6	“ What is it ? ” I asked . He answered , “ It is a measuring basket going out. ” He also said , “ It is a symbol of the people ’ s sins in all the land. ”
NCV	Zechariah	5	7	Then the lid made of lead was raised , and there was a woman sitting inside the basket .
NCV	Zechariah	5	8	The angel said , “ The woman stands for wickedness. ” Then he pushed her back into the basket and put the lid back down .
NCV	Zechariah	5	9	Then I looked up and saw two women going out with the wind in their wings . Their wings were like those of a stork , and they lifted up the basket between earth and the sky .
NCV	Zechariah	5	10	I asked the angel who was talking with me , “ Where are they taking the basket ? ”
NCV	Zechariah	5	11	“ They are going to Babylonia to build a temple for it , ” he answered . “ When the temple is ready , they will set the basket there in its place. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	6	6	The chariot pulled by the black horses will go to the land of the north . The white horses will go to the land of the west , and the spotted horses will go to the land of the south. ”
NCV	Zechariah	6	2	Red horses pulled the first chariot . Black horses pulled the second chariot .
NCV	Zechariah	6	3	White horses pulled the third chariot , and strong , spotted horses pulled the fourth chariot .
NCV	Zechariah	6	4	I asked the angel who was talking with me , “ What are these , sir ? ”
NCV	Zechariah	6	5	He said , “ These are the four spirits of heaven . They have just come from the presence of the Lord of the whole world .
NCV	Zechariah	6	7	When the powerful horses went out , they were eager to go through all the earth . So he said , “ Go through all the earth , ” and they did .
NCV	Zechariah	6	8	Then he called to me , “ Look , the horses that went north have caused my spirit to rest in the land of the north. ” A Crown for Joshua
NCV	Zechariah	6	9	The Lord spoke his word to me , saying ,
NCV	Zechariah	6	10	“ Take silver and gold from Heldai , Tobijah , and Jedaiah , who were captives in Babylon . Go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah , who came from Babylon .
NCV	Zechariah	6	11	Make the silver and gold into a crown , and put it on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest .
NCV	Zechariah	6	12	Tell him this is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ A man whose name is the Branch will branch out from where he is , and he will build the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	6	13	One man [ a ] will build the Temple of the Lord , and the other [ b ] will receive honor . One man will sit on his throne and rule , and the other will be a priest on his throne . And these two men will work together in peace. ’
NCV	Zechariah	6	14	The crown will be kept in the Temple of the Lord to remind Heldai , Tobijah , Jedaiah , and Josiah son of Zephaniah .
NCV	Zechariah	6	15	People living far away will come and build the Temple of the Lord . Then you will know the Lord All-Powerful has sent me to you . This will happen if you completely obey the Lord your God. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	7	7	The Lord used the earlier prophets to say the same thing , when Jerusalem and the surrounding towns were at peace and wealthy , and people lived in the southern area and the western hills. ’ ”
NCV	Zechariah	7	2	The city of Bethel sent Sharezer , Regem-Melech , and their men to ask the Lord a question .
NCV	Zechariah	7	3	They went to the prophets and priests who were at the Temple of the Lord All-Powerful . The men said , “ For years in the fifth month of each year we have shown our sadness and fasted . Should we continue to do this ? ”
NCV	Zechariah	7	4	The Lord All-Powerful spoke his word to me , saying ,
NCV	Zechariah	7	5	“ Tell the priests and the people in the land : ‘ For seventy years you fasted and cried in the fifth and seventh months , but that was not really for me .
NCV	Zechariah	7	6	And when you ate and drank , it was really for yourselves .
NCV	Zechariah	7	8	And the Lord spoke his word to Zechariah again , saying ,
NCV	Zechariah	7	9	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ Do what is right and true . Be kind and merciful to each other .
NCV	Zechariah	7	10	Don ’ t hurt widows and orphans , foreigners or the poor ; don ’ t even think of doing evil to somebody else. ’
NCV	Zechariah	7	11	“ But they refused to pay attention ; they were stubborn and did not want to listen anymore .
NCV	Zechariah	7	12	They made their hearts as hard as rock and would not listen to the teachings of the Lord All-Powerful . And they would not hear the words he sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets . So the Lord All-Powerful became very angry .
NCV	Zechariah	7	13	“ ‘ When I called to them , they would not listen . So when they called to me , I would not listen , ’ says the Lord All-Powerful .

NCV	Zechariah	8	8	I will bring them back , and they will live in Jerusalem . They will be my people , and I will be their good and loyal God. ”
NCV	Zechariah	8	2	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ I have a very strong love for Jerusalem . My strong love for her is like a fire burning in me. ”

NCV	Zechariah	8	5	And the streets will be filled with boys and girls playing. ”

NCV	Zechariah	8	7	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ I will save my people from countries in the east and west .
NCV	Zechariah	8	9	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Work hard , you who are hearing these words today . The prophets spoke these words when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord All-Powerful , for the building of the Temple .
NCV	Zechariah	8	10	Before that time there was no money to hire people or animals . People could not safely come and go because of the enemies ; I had turned everyone against his neighbor .
NCV	Zechariah	8	11	But I will not do to these people who are left what I did in the past , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Zechariah	8	12	“ They will plant their seeds in peace , their grapevines will have fruit , the ground will give good crops , and the sky will send rain . I will give all this to the people who are left alive .
NCV	Zechariah	8	13	Judah and Israel , your names have been used as curses in other nations . But I will save you , and you will become a blessing . So don ’ t be afraid ; work hard. ”
NCV	Zechariah	8	14	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ When your ancestors made me angry , I planned to punish you . I did not change my mind , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Zechariah	8	15	“ But now I will do something different . I am planning to do good to Jerusalem and Judah . So don ’ t be afraid .
NCV	Zechariah	8	16	These are the things you should do : Tell each other the truth . In the courts judge with truth and complete fairness .
NCV	Zechariah	8	17	Do not make plans to hurt your neighbors , and don ’ t love false promises . I hate all these things , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	8	18	The Lord All-Powerful spoke his word to me again .
NCV	Zechariah	8	19	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ The special days when you fast in the fourth , fifth , seventh , and tenth months will become good , joyful , happy feasts in Judah . But you must love truth and peace. ”
NCV	Zechariah	8	20	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Many people from many cities will still come to Jerusalem .
NCV	Zechariah	8	21	People from one city will go and say to those from another city , ‘ We are going to pray to the Lord and to ask the Lord All-Powerful for help . Come and go with us. ’
NCV	Zechariah	8	22	Many people and powerful nations will come to worship the Lord All-Powerful in Jerusalem and to pray to the Lord for help. ”
NCV	Zechariah	8	23	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ At that time , ten men from different countries will come and take hold of a Judean by his coat . They will say to him , ‘ Let us go with you , because we have heard that God is with you. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly , people of Jerusalem ! Shout for joy , people of Jerusalem ! Your king is coming to you . He does what is right , and he saves . He is gentle and riding on a donkey , on the colt of a donkey .
NCV	Zechariah	9	2	The message is also against the city of Hamath , on the border , and against Tyre and Sidon , with their skill .
NCV	Zechariah	9	3	Tyre has built a strong wall for herself . She has piled up silver like dust and gold like the mud in the streets .
NCV	Zechariah	9	4	But the Lord will take away all she has and destroy her power on the sea . That city will be destroyed by fire .
NCV	Zechariah	9	5	The city of Ashkelon will see it and be afraid . The people of Gaza will shake with fear , and the people of Ekron will lose hope . No king will be left in Gaza , and no one will live in Ashkelon anymore .
NCV	Zechariah	9	6	Foreigners will live in Ashdod , and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines .
NCV	Zechariah	9	7	I will stop them from drinking blood and from eating forbidden food . Those left alive will belong to God . They will be leaders in Judah , and Ekron will become like the Jebusites .
NCV	Zechariah	9	8	I will protect my Temple from armies who would come or go . No one will hurt my people again , because now I am watching them . The King Is Coming
NCV	Zechariah	9	10	I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the horses from Jerusalem . The bows used in war will be broken . The king will talk to the nations about peace . His kingdom will go from sea to sea , and from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth .
NCV	Zechariah	9	11	As for you , because of the blood of the agreement with you I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit .
NCV	Zechariah	9	12	You prisoners who have hope , return to your place of safety . Today I am telling you that I will give you back twice as much as before .
NCV	Zechariah	9	13	I will use Judah like a bow and Ephraim like the arrows . Jerusalem , I will use your men to fight the men of Greece . I will use you like a warrior ’ s sword .
NCV	Zechariah	9	14	Then the Lord will appear above them , and his arrows will shoot like lightning . The Lord God will blow the trumpet , and he will march in the storms of the south .
NCV	Zechariah	9	15	The Lord All-Powerful will protect them ; they will destroy the enemy with slingshots . They will drink and shout like drunks . They will be filled like a bowl used for sprinkling blood at the corners of the altar .
NCV	Zechariah	9	16	On that day the Lord their God will save them as if his people were sheep . They will shine in his land like jewels in a crown .

NCV	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria . I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon until there isn ’ t enough room for them all .
NCV	Zechariah	10	2	Idols tell lies ; fortune-tellers see false visions and tell about false dreams . The comfort they give is worth nothing . So the people are like lost sheep . They are abused , because there is no shepherd .
NCV	Zechariah	10	3	The Lord says , “ I am angry at my shepherds , and I will punish the leaders . I , the Lord All-Powerful , care for my flock , the people of Judah . I will make them like my proud war horses .
NCV	Zechariah	10	4	From Judah will come the cornerstone , and the tent peg , the battle bow , and every ruler .
NCV	Zechariah	10	5	Together they will be like soldiers marching to battle through muddy streets . The Lord is with them , so they will fight and defeat the horsemen .
NCV	Zechariah	10	6	“ I will strengthen the people of Judah and save the people of Joseph . I will bring them back , because I care about them . It will be as though I had never left them , because I am the Lord their God , and I will answer them .
NCV	Zechariah	10	7	The people of Ephraim will be strong like soldiers ; they will be glad as when they have drunk wine . Their children will see it and rejoice ; they will be happy in the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	10	8	I will call my people and gather them together . I will save them , and they will grow in number as they grew in number before .
NCV	Zechariah	10	9	I have scattered them among the nations , but in those faraway places , they will remember me . They and their children will live and return .
NCV	Zechariah	10	11	They will come through the sea of trouble . The waves of the sea will be calm , and the Nile River will dry up . I will defeat Assyria ’ s pride and destroy Egypt ’ s power over other countries .

NCV	Zechariah	11	11	That day it was broken . The weak ones in the flock who were watching me knew this message was from the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	11	2	Cry , pine trees , because the cedar has fallen , because the tall trees are ruined . Cry , oaks in Bashan , because the mighty forest has been cut down .
NCV	Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the shepherds crying because their rich pastures are destroyed . Listen to the lions roaring because the lovely land of the Jordan River is ruined . The Two Shepherds
NCV	Zechariah	11	4	This is what the Lord my God says : “ Feed the flock that are about to be killed .
NCV	Zechariah	11	5	Their buyers kill them and are not punished . Those who sell them say , ‘ Praise the Lord , I am rich. ’ Even the shepherds don ’ t feel sorry for their sheep .
NCV	Zechariah	11	6	I don ’ t feel sorry anymore for the people of this country , ” says the Lord . “ I will let everyone be under the power of his neighbor and king . They will bring trouble to the country , and I will not save anyone from them. ”
NCV	Zechariah	11	7	So I fed the flock about to be killed , particularly the weakest ones . Then I took two sticks ; I called one Pleasant and the other Union , and I fed the flock .
NCV	Zechariah	11	8	In one month I got rid of three shepherds . The flock did not pay attention to me , and I got impatient with them .
NCV	Zechariah	11	9	I said , “ I will no longer take care of you like a shepherd . Let those that are dying die , and let those that are to be destroyed be destroyed . Let those that are left eat each other. ”
NCV	Zechariah	11	10	Then I broke the stick named Pleasant to break the agreement God made with all the nations .
NCV	Zechariah	11	12	Then I said , “ If you want to pay me , pay me . If not , then don ’ t. ” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver .
NCV	Zechariah	11	13	The Lord said to me , “ Throw the money to the potter. ” That is how little they thought I was worth . [ b ] So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the Temple of the Lord .
NCV	Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke the second stick , named Union , to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
NCV	Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord said to me , “ Get the things used by a foolish shepherd again ,
NCV	Zechariah	11	16	because I am going to get a new shepherd for the country . He will not care for the dying sheep , or look for the young ones , or heal the injured ones , or feed the healthy . But he will eat the best sheep and tear off their hoofs .
NCV	Zechariah	11	17	“ How terrible it will be for the useless shepherd who abandoned the flock . A sword will strike his arm and his right eye . His arm will lose all its strength , and his right eye will go blind. ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	12	12	The land will cry , each family by itself : the family of David by itself and their wives by themselves , the family of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves ,
NCV	Zechariah	12	2	“ I will make Jerusalem like a cup of poison to the nations around her . They will come and attack Jerusalem and Judah .
NCV	Zechariah	12	3	One day all the nations on earth will come together to attack Jerusalem , but I will make it like a heavy rock ; anyone who tries to move it will get hurt .
NCV	Zechariah	12	4	At that time I will confuse every horse and cause its rider to go crazy , ” says the Lord . “ I will watch over Judah , but I will blind all the horses of the enemies .
NCV	Zechariah	12	5	Then the leaders of Judah will say to themselves , ‘ The people of Jerusalem are strong , because the Lord All-Powerful is their God. ’
NCV	Zechariah	12	6	“ At that time I will make the leaders of Judah like a fire burning a stack of wood or like a fire burning straw . They will destroy all the people around them left and right . But the people of Jerusalem will remain safe .
NCV	Zechariah	12	7	“ The Lord will save the homes of Judah first so that the honor given to David ’ s family and to the people of Jerusalem won ’ t be greater than the honor given to Judah .
NCV	Zechariah	12	8	At that time the Lord will protect the people in Jerusalem . Then even the weakest of them will be strong like David . And the family of David will be like God , like an angel of the Lord in front of them .
NCV	Zechariah	12	9	At that time I will go to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem . Crying for the One They Stabbed
NCV	Zechariah	12	10	“ I will pour out on David ’ s family and the people in Jerusalem a spirit of kindness and mercy . They will look at me , the one they have stabbed , and they will cry like someone crying over the death of an only child . They will be as sad as someone who has lost a firstborn son .
NCV	Zechariah	12	11	At that time there will be much crying in Jerusalem , like the crying for Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo .
NCV	Zechariah	12	13	the family of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves , the family of Shimei by itself and their wives by themselves ,

NCV	Zechariah	13	13	“ At that time a fountain will be open for David ’ s descendants and for the people of Jerusalem to cleanse them of their sin and uncleanness. ”
NCV	Zechariah	13	2	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ At that time I will get rid of the names of the idols from the land ; no one will remember them anymore . I will also remove the prophets and unclean spirits from the land .
NCV	Zechariah	13	3	If a person continues to prophesy , his own father and mother , the ones who gave birth to him , will tell him , ‘ You have told lies using the Lord ’ s name , so you must die. ’ When he prophesies , his own father and mother who gave birth to him will stab him .
NCV	Zechariah	13	4	“ At that time the prophets will be ashamed of their visions and prophecies . They won ’ t wear the prophet ’ s clothes made of hair to trick people .
NCV	Zechariah	13	5	Each of them will say , ‘ I am not a prophet . I am a farmer and have been a farmer since I was young. ’
NCV	Zechariah	13	6	But someone will ask , ‘ What are the deep cuts on your body ? ’ And each will answer , ‘ I was hurt at my friend ’ s house. ’ The Shepherd Is Killed
NCV	Zechariah	13	7	“ Sword , hit the shepherd . Attack the man who is my friend , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ Kill the shepherd , and the sheep will scatter , and I will punish the little ones. ”
NCV	Zechariah	13	8	The Lord says , “ Two-thirds of the people through all the land will die . They will be gone , and one-third will be left .
NCV	Zechariah	13	9	The third that is left I will test with fire , purifying them like silver , testing them like gold . Then they will call on me , and I will answer them . I will say , ‘ You are my people , ’ and they will say , ‘ The Lord is our God. ’ ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® . Copyright ©

NCV	Zechariah	14	14	The people of Judah will fight in Jerusalem . And the wealth of the nations around them will be collected—much gold , silver , and clothes .
NCV	Zechariah	14	2	I will bring all the nations together to fight Jerusalem . They will capture the city and rob the houses and attack the women . Half the people will be taken away as captives , but the rest of the people won ’ t be taken from the city .
NCV	Zechariah	14	3	Then the Lord will go to war against those nations ; he will fight as in a day of battle .
NCV	Zechariah	14	4	On that day he will stand on the Mount of Olives , east of Jerusalem . The Mount of Olives will split in two , forming a deep valley that runs east and west . Half the mountain will move toward the north , and half will move toward the south .
NCV	Zechariah	14	5	You will run through this mountain valley to the other side , just as you ran from the earthquake when Uzziah was king of Judah . Then the Lord my God will come and all the holy ones with him .
NCV	Zechariah	14	6	On that day there will be no light , cold , or frost .
NCV	Zechariah	14	7	There will be no other day like it , and the Lord knows when it will come . There will be no day or night ; even at evening it will still be light .
NCV	Zechariah	14	8	At that time fresh water will flow from Jerusalem . Half of it will flow east to the Dead Sea , and half will flow west to the Mediterranean Sea . It will flow summer and winter .
NCV	Zechariah	14	9	Then the Lord will be king over the whole world . At that time there will be only one Lord , and his name will be the only name .
NCV	Zechariah	14	10	All the land south of Jerusalem from Geba to Rimmon will be turned into a plain . Jerusalem will be raised up , but it will stay in the same place . The city will reach from the Benjamin Gate and to the First Gate to the Corner Gate , and from the Tower of Hananel to the king ’ s winepresses .
NCV	Zechariah	14	11	People will live there , and it will never be destroyed again . Jerusalem will be safe .
NCV	Zechariah	14	12	But the Lord will bring a terrible disease on the nations that fought against Jerusalem . Their flesh will rot away while they are still standing up . Their eyes will rot in their sockets , and their tongues will rot in their mouths .
NCV	Zechariah	14	13	At that time the Lord will cause panic . Everybody will grab his neighbor , and they will attack each other .
NCV	Zechariah	14	15	A similar disease will strike the horses , mules , camels , donkeys , and all the animals in the camps .
NCV	Zechariah	14	16	All of those left alive of the people who came to fight Jerusalem will come back to Jerusalem year after year to worship the King , the Lord All-Powerful , and to celebrate the Feast of Shelters .
NCV	Zechariah	14	17	Anyone from the nations who does not go to Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord All-Powerful , will not have rain fall on his land .
NCV	Zechariah	14	18	If the Egyptians do not go to Jerusalem , they will not have rain . Then the Lord will send them the same terrible disease he sent the other nations that did not celebrate the Feast of Shelters .
NCV	Zechariah	14	19	This will be the punishment for Egypt and any nation which does not go to celebrate the Feast of Shelters .
NCV	Zechariah	14	20	At that time the horses ’ bells will have written on them : holy to the lord . The cooking pots in the Temple of the Lord will be like the holy altar bowls .
NCV	Zechariah	14	21	Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord All-Powerful , and everyone who offers sacrifices will be able to take food from them and cook in them .

NCV	Malachi	1	1	This message is the word of the Lord given to Israel through Malachi . God Loves Israel
NCV	Malachi	1	2	The Lord said , “ I have loved you. ” But you ask , “ How have you loved us ? ” The Lord said , “ Esau and Jacob were brothers . I loved Jacob ,
NCV	Malachi	1	3	but I hated Esau . I destroyed his mountain country and left his land to the wild dogs of the desert. ”
NCV	Malachi	1	4	The people of Edom might say , “ We were destroyed , but we will go back and rebuild the ruins. ” But the Lord All-Powerful says , “ If they rebuild them , I will destroy them . People will say , ‘ Edom is a wicked country . The Lord is always angry with the Edomites. ’
NCV	Malachi	1	5	You will see these things with your own eyes . And you will say , ‘ The Lord is great , even outside the borders of Israel ! ’ ” The Priests Don ’ t Respect God
NCV	Malachi	1	6	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ A son honors his father , and a servant honors his master. ” I am a father , so why don ’ t you honor me ? I am a master , so why don ’ t you respect me ? You priests do not respect me . “ But you ask , ‘ How have we shown you disrespect ? ’
NCV	Malachi	1	7	“ You have shown it by bringing unclean food to my altar . “ But you ask , ‘ What makes it unclean ? ’ “ It is unclean because you don ’ t respect the altar of the Lord .
NCV	Malachi	1	8	When you bring blind animals as sacrifices , that is wrong . When you bring crippled and sick animals , that is wrong . Try giving them to your governor . Would he be pleased with you ? He wouldn ’ t accept you , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	1	9	“ Now ask God to be kind to you , but he won ’ t accept you with such offerings , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	1	10	“ I wish one of you would close the Temple doors so that you would not light useless fires on my altar ! I am not pleased with you and will not accept your gifts , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	1	11	“ From the east to the west I will be honored among the nations . Everywhere they will bring incense and clean offerings to me , because I will be honored among the nations , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	1	12	“ But you don ’ t honor me . You say about the Lord ’ s altar , ‘ It is unclean , and the food has no worth. ’
NCV	Malachi	1	13	You say , ‘ We are tired of doing this , ’ and you sniff at it in disgust , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ And you bring hurt , crippled , and sick animals as gifts . You bring them as gifts , but I won ’ t accept them from you , ” says the Lord .
NCV	Malachi	1	14	“ The person who cheats will be cursed . He has a male animal in his flock and promises to offer it , but then he offers to the Lord an animal that has something wrong with it .

NCV	Malachi	2	2	Listen to me . Pay attention to what I say . Honor my name , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ If you don ’ t , I will send a curse on you and on your blessings . I have already cursed them , because you don ’ t pay attention to what I say .
NCV	Malachi	2	3	“ I will punish your descendants . I will smear your faces with the animal insides left from your feasts , and you will be thrown away with it .
NCV	Malachi	2	4	Then you will know that I am giving you this command so my agreement with Levi will continue , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	2	5	“ My agreement for priests was with the tribe of Levi . I promised them life and peace so they would honor me . And they did honor me and fear me .
NCV	Malachi	2	6	They taught the true teachings and spoke no lies . With peace and honesty they did what I said they should do , and they kept many people from sinning .
NCV	Malachi	2	7	“ A priest should teach what he knows , and people should learn the teachings from him , because he is the messenger of the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	2	8	But you priests have stopped obeying me . With your teachings you have caused many people to do wrong . You have broken the agreement with the tribe of Levi ! ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	2	9	“ You have not been careful to do what I say , but instead you take sides in court cases . So I have caused you to be hated and disgraced in front of everybody. ” Judah Was Not Loyal to God
NCV	Malachi	2	10	We all have the same father ; the same God made us . So why do people break their promises to each other and show no respect for the agreement our ancestors made with God ?
NCV	Malachi	2	11	The people of Judah have broken their promises . They have done something God hates in Israel and Jerusalem : The people of Judah did not respect the Temple that the Lord loves , and the men of Judah married women who worship foreign gods .
NCV	Malachi	2	12	Whoever does this might bring offerings to the Lord All-Powerful , but the Lord will still cut that person off from the community of Israel .
NCV	Malachi	2	13	This is another thing you do . You cover the Lord ’ s altar with your tears . You cry and moan , because he does not accept your offerings and is not pleased with what you bring .
NCV	Malachi	2	14	You ask , “ Why ? ” It is because the Lord sees how you treated the wife you married when you were young . You broke your promise to her , even though she was your partner and you had an agreement with her .
NCV	Malachi	2	15	God made husbands and wives to become one body and one spirit for his purpose—so they would have children who are true to God . So be careful , and do not break your promise to the wife you married when you were young .
NCV	Malachi	2	16	The Lord God of Israel says , “ I hate divorce . And I hate people who do cruel things as easily as they put on clothes , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . So be careful . And do not break your trust . The Special Day of Judging
NCV	Malachi	2	17	You have tired the Lord with your words . You ask , “ How have we tired him ? ” You did it by saying , “ The Lord thinks anyone who does evil is good , and he is pleased with them. ” Or you asked , “ Where is the God who is fair ? ” The Holy Bible , New Century Version® .

NCV	Malachi	3	3	Like someone who heats and purifies silver , he will purify the Levites and make them pure like gold and silver . Then they will bring offerings to the Lord in the right way .
NCV	Malachi	3	2	No one can live through that time ; no one can survive when he comes . He will be like a purifying fire and like laundry soap .
NCV	Malachi	3	4	And the Lord will accept the offerings from Judah and Jerusalem , as it was in the past .
NCV	Malachi	3	5	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ Then I will come to you and judge you . I will be quick to testify against those who take part in evil magic , adultery , and lying under oath , those who cheat workers of their pay and who cheat widows and orphans , those who are unfair to foreigners , and those who do not respect me . Stealing from God
NCV	Malachi	3	6	“ I the Lord do not change . So you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed .
NCV	Malachi	3	7	Since the time of your ancestors , you have disobeyed my rules and have not kept them . Return to me , and I will return to you , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ But you ask , ‘ How can we return ? ’
NCV	Malachi	3	8	“ Should a person rob God ? But you are robbing me . “ You ask , ‘ How have we robbed you ? ’ “ You have robbed me in your offerings and the tenth of your crops .
NCV	Malachi	3	9	So a curse is on you , because the whole nation has robbed me .
NCV	Malachi	3	10	Bring to the storehouse a full tenth of what you earn so there will be food in my house . Test me in this , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . “ I will open the windows of heaven for you and pour out all the blessings you need .
NCV	Malachi	3	11	I will stop the insects so they won ’ t eat your crops . The grapes won ’ t fall from your vines before they are ready to pick , ” says the Lord All-Powerful .
NCV	Malachi	3	12	“ All the nations will call you blessed , because you will have a pleasant country , ” says the Lord All-Powerful . The Lord ’ s Promise of Mercy
NCV	Malachi	3	13	The Lord says , “ You have said terrible things about me . “ But you ask , ‘ What have we said about you ? ’
NCV	Malachi	3	14	“ You have said , ‘ It is useless to serve God . It did no good to obey his laws and to show the Lord All-Powerful that we were sorry for what we did .
NCV	Malachi	3	15	So we say that proud people are happy . Evil people succeed . They challenge God and get away with it. ’ ”
NCV	Malachi	3	16	Then those who honored the Lord spoke with each other , and the Lord listened and heard them . The names of those who honored the Lord and respected him were written in his presence in a book to be remembered .
NCV	Malachi	3	17	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ They belong to me ; on that day they will be my very own . As a parent shows mercy to his child who serves him , I will show mercy to my people .
