AMP	Matthew	6	2	“ So whenever you give to the poor and do acts of kindness , do not blow a trumpet before you [ to advertise it ] , as the hypocrites do [ like actors acting out a role ] in the synagogues and in the streets , so that they may be honored and recognized and praised by men . I assure you and most solemnly say to you , they [ already ] have their reward in full .
AMP	Matthew	6	3	But when you give to the poor and do acts of kindness , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing [ give in complete secrecy ] ,

AMP	Matthew	6	7	“ And when you pray , do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . ( A )

AMP	Matthew	8	24	And suddenly a violent storm arose on the sea , so that the boat was being covered by the waves ; but Jesus was sleeping .
AMP	Matthew	8	25	And the disciples went and woke Him , saying , “ Lord , save us , we are going to die ! ”
AMP	Matthew	8	26	He said to them , “ Why are you afraid , you men of little faith ? ” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was [ at once ] a great and wonderful calm [ a perfect peacefulness ] .
AMP	Matthew	8	27	The men wondered in amazement , saying , “ What kind of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey Him ? ” Jesus Casts Out Demons
AMP	Matthew	8	28	When He arrived at the other side in the country of the Gadarenes , two demon-possessed men coming out of the tombs met Him . They were so extremely fierce and violent that no one could pass by that way . ( K )

AMP	Matthew	8	32	And He said to them , “ Go ! ” So they came out [ of the men ] and went into the pigs , and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the water .
AMP	Matthew	8	33	The herdsmen ran away , and went to the city and reported everything , including what had happened to the men under the power of demons .

AMP	Matthew	9	11	When the Pharisees saw this , they asked His disciples , “ Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”

AMP	Matthew	9	14	Then the disciples of John [ the Baptist ] came to Jesus , asking , “ Why do we and the Pharisees often fast [ as a religious exercise ] , but Your disciples do not fast ? ”
AMP	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus replied to them , “ Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them ? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .

AMP	Matthew	9	18	While He was saying these things to them , a ruler ( synagogue official ) entered [ the house ] and kneeled down and worshiped Him , saying , “ My daughter has just now died ; but come and lay Your hand on her , and she will live. ” ( D )

AMP	Matthew	9	20	Then a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the [ tassel ] fringe of His outer robe ; ( E )

AMP	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turning and seeing her said , “ Take courage , daughter ; your [ personal trust and confident ] faith [ in Me ] has made you well. ” And at once the woman was [ completely ] healed .
AMP	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus came to the ruler ’ s house , and saw the flute players [ who were professional , hired mourners ] and the [ grieving ] crowd making an uproar ,

AMP	Matthew	9	28	When He went into the house , the blind men came up to Him , and Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe [ with a deep , abiding trust ] that I am able to do this ? ” They said to Him , “ Yes , Lord. ”
AMP	Matthew	9	29	Then He touched their eyes , saying , “ According to your faith [ your trust and confidence in My power and My ability to heal ] it will be done to you. ”
AMP	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened . And Jesus [ d ] sternly warned them : “ See that no one knows this ! ”

AMP	Matthew	11	11	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist ; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater [ in privilege ] than he .
AMP	Matthew	11	2	Now when [ a ] John [ the Baptist ] in prison heard about the activities of Christ , he sent word by his disciples ( A )
AMP	Matthew	11	3	and asked Him , “ Are You the Expected One ( the Messiah ) , or should we look for someone else [ who will be the promised One ] ? ” ( B )

AMP	Matthew	11	7	As these men were going away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out in the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind [ which is commonplace ] ?
AMP	Matthew	11	8	What did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing [ entirely unsuited for the harsh desert ] ? Those who wear soft clothing are in the palaces of kings !
AMP	Matthew	11	9	But what did you [ really ] go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and one [ more eminent , more remarkable , and ] [ b ] far more than a prophet [ who foretells the future ] .
AMP	Matthew	11	10	This is the one of whom it is written [ by the prophet Malachi ] , ‘ Behold , I send My messenger ahead of You , Who will prepare Your way before You. ’ ( E )
AMP	Matthew	11	12	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violent assault , and violent men seize it by force [ as a precious prize ] .
AMP	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the Law prophesied up until John .
AMP	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to accept it , John himself is [ the fulfillment of ] Elijah [ as the messenger ] who was to come [ before the kingdom ] . ( F )
AMP	Matthew	11	15	He who has ears to hear , let him hear and heed My words .
AMP	Matthew	11	16	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like little children sitting in the market places , who call to the others ,
AMP	Matthew	11	17	and say ‘ We piped the flute for you [ playing wedding ] , and you did not dance ; we wailed sad dirges [ playing funeral ] , and you did not mourn and cry aloud. ’
AMP	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking [ with others ] , and they say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
AMP	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking [ with others ] , and they say , ‘ Look ! A glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners [ including non-observant Jews ] ! ’ Yet wisdom is justified and vindicated by her deeds [ in the lives of those who respond to Me ] . ” The Unrepenting Cities
AMP	Matthew	11	20	Then He began to denounce [ the people in ] the cities in which most of His miracles were done , because they did not repent [ and change their hearts and lives ] .
AMP	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe ( judgment is coming ) to you , [ c ] Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon [ cities of the Gentiles ] , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes [ their hearts would have been changed and they would have expressed sorrow for their sin and rebellion against God ] .
AMP	Matthew	11	22	Nevertheless I say to you , it will be more tolerable for [ the pagan cities of ] Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
AMP	Matthew	11	23	And you , Capernaum , are you to be exalted to heaven [ for your apathy and unresponsiveness ] ? You will descend to Hades ( the realm of the dead ) ; for if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
AMP	Matthew	11	24	But I say to you , it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment , than for you. ” Come to Me
AMP	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus said , “ I praise You , Father , Lord of heaven and earth [ I openly and joyfully acknowledge Your great wisdom ] , that You have hidden these things [ these spiritual truths ] from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants [ to new believers , to those seeking God ’ s will and purpose ] .
AMP	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight .
AMP	Matthew	11	27	All things have been handed over to Me by My Father ; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Son except the Father ; and no one fully knows and accurately understands the Father except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son [ deliberately ] wills to reveal Him .
AMP	Matthew	11	28	“ Come to Me , all who are weary and heavily burdened [ by religious rituals that provide no peace ] , and I will give you rest [ refreshing your souls with salvation ] .
AMP	Matthew	11	29	Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me [ following Me as My disciple ] , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest ( renewal , blessed quiet ) for your souls . ( G )

AMP	Matthew	12	19	“ He will not quarrel , nor cry out loudly ; Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets .

AMP	Matthew	13	13	This is the reason I speak to the crowds in parables : because while [ having the power of ] seeing they do not see , and while [ having the power of ] hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand and grasp [ spiritual things ] .
AMP	Matthew	13	2	But such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat there [ positioning Himself as a teacher ] , while the whole crowd stood on the shore .
AMP	Matthew	13	3	He told them many things in [ a ] parables , saying , “ Listen carefully : a sower went out to sow [ seed in his field ] ;
AMP	Matthew	13	4	and as he sowed , some seed fell beside the road [ between the fields ] , and the birds came and ate it .
AMP	Matthew	13	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground , where they did not have much soil ; and at once they sprang up because they had no depth of soil .
AMP	Matthew	13	6	But when the sun rose , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
AMP	Matthew	13	7	Other seed fell among thorns , and thorns came up and choked them out .
AMP	Matthew	13	8	Other seed fell on good soil and yielded grain , some a hundred times as much [ as was sown ] , some sixty [ times as much ] , and some thirty .
AMP	Matthew	13	9	He who has ears [ to hear ] , let him hear and heed My words. ” An Explanation
AMP	Matthew	13	10	Then the disciples came to Him and asked , “ Why do You speak to the crowds in parables ? ”
AMP	Matthew	13	11	Jesus replied to them , “ To you it has been granted to know the [ b ] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been granted . ( B )
AMP	Matthew	13	12	For whoever has [ spiritual wisdom because he is receptive to God ’ s word ] , to him more will be given , and he will be richly and abundantly supplied ; but whoever does not have [ spiritual wisdom because he has devalued God ’ s word ] , even what he has will be taken away from him . ( C )
AMP	Matthew	13	14	In them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled , which says , ‘ You will hear and keep on hearing , but never understand ; And you will look and keep on looking , but never comprehend ;
AMP	Matthew	13	15	For this nation ’ s heart has grown hard , And with their ears they hardly hear , And they have [ tightly ] closed their eyes , Otherwise they would see with their eyes , And hear with their ears , And understand with their heart , and turn [ to Me ] And I would heal them [ spiritually ] . ’ ( D )
AMP	Matthew	13	16	But blessed [ spiritually aware , and favored by God ] are your eyes , because they see ; and your ears , because they hear . ( E )
AMP	Matthew	13	17	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , many prophets and righteous men [ who were honorable and in right standing with God ] longed to see what you see , and did not see it , and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it . The Sower Explained
AMP	Matthew	13	18	“ Listen then to the [ meaning of the ] parable of the sower : ( F )
AMP	Matthew	13	19	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom [ regarding salvation ] and does not understand and grasp it , the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road .
AMP	Matthew	13	20	The one on whom seed was sown on rocky ground , this is the one who hears the word and at once welcomes it with joy ;
AMP	Matthew	13	21	yet he has no [ substantial ] root in himself , but is only temporary , and when pressure or persecution comes because of the word , immediately he stumbles and falls away [ abandoning the One who is the source of salvation ] .
AMP	Matthew	13	22	And the one on whom seed was sown among thorns , this is the one who hears the word , but the worries and distractions of the world and the deceitfulness [ the superficial pleasures and delight ] of riches choke the word , and it yields no fruit .
AMP	Matthew	13	23	And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil , this is the one who hears the word and understands and grasps it ; he indeed bears fruit and yields , some a hundred times [ as much as was sown ] , some sixty [ times as much ] , and some thirty. ” ( G ) Weeds among Wheat
AMP	Matthew	13	24	Jesus gave them another parable [ to consider ] , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field .
AMP	Matthew	13	25	But while his men were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed [ c ] weeds [ resembling wheat ] among the wheat , and went away .
AMP	Matthew	13	26	So when the plants sprouted and formed grain , the weeds appeared also .
AMP	Matthew	13	27	The servants of the owner came to him and said , ‘ Sir , did you not sow good seed in your field ? Then how does it have weeds in it ? ’
AMP	Matthew	13	28	He replied to them , ‘ An enemy has done this. ’ The servants asked him , ‘ Then do you want us to go and pull them out ? ’
AMP	Matthew	13	29	But he said , ‘ No ; because as you pull out the weeds , you may uproot the wheat with them .
AMP	Matthew	13	30	Let them grow together until the harvest ; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers , “ First gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned ; but gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” The Mustard Seed
AMP	Matthew	13	31	He gave them another parable [ to consider ] , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field ; ( H )
AMP	Matthew	13	32	and of all the seeds [ planted in the region ] it is the smallest , but when it has grown it is the largest of the garden herbs and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air find shelter in its branches. ” ( I ) The Leaven
AMP	Matthew	13	33	He told them another parable , “ The kingdom of heaven is like [ d ] leaven , which a woman took and worked into three [ e ] measures of flour until all of it was leavened. ” ( J )
AMP	Matthew	13	34	All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables , and He said nothing to them without [ using ] a parable .
AMP	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet : “ I will open My mouth in parables ; I will utter things [ unknown and unattainable ] that have been hidden [ from mankind ] since the foundation of the world. ” ( K ) The Weeds Explained
AMP	Matthew	13	36	Then He left the crowds and went into the house . And His disciples came to Him saying , “ Explain [ clearly ] to us the parable of the weeds in the field. ”
AMP	Matthew	13	37	He answered , “ The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ,
AMP	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world ; and [ as for ] the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the weeds are the sons of the evil one ;
AMP	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is the end of the age ; and the reapers are angels .
AMP	Matthew	13	40	So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned in the fire , so will it be at the end of the age .
AMP	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send out His angels , and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend [ those things by which people are led into sin ] , and all who practice evil [ leading others into sin ] ,
AMP	Matthew	13	42	and will throw them into the furnace of fire ; in that place there will be weeping [ over sorrow and pain ] and grinding of teeth [ over distress and anger ] .
AMP	Matthew	13	43	Then the righteous [ those who seek the will of God ] will shine forth [ radiating the new life ] like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears [ to hear ] , let him hear and heed My words . ( L ) Hidden Treasure
AMP	Matthew	13	44	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a [ very precious ] treasure hidden in a field , which a man found and hid again ; then in his joy he goes and sells all he has and buys that field [ securing the treasure for himself ] . A Costly Pearl
AMP	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls ,
AMP	Matthew	13	46	and upon finding a single pearl of great value , he went and sold all that he had and bought it . A Dragnet
AMP	Matthew	13	47	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet which was lowered into the sea , and gathered fish of every kind ,
AMP	Matthew	13	48	and when it was full , they dragged it up on the beach ; and they sat down and sorted out the good fish into baskets , but the worthless ones they threw away .
AMP	Matthew	13	49	So it will be at the end of the age ; the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
AMP	Matthew	13	50	and throw the wicked into the furnace of fire ; in that place there will be weeping [ over sorrow and pain ] and grinding of teeth [ over distress and anger ] .
AMP	Matthew	13	51	“ Have you understood all these things [ in the lessons of the parables ] ? ” They said to Jesus , “ Yes. ”
AMP	Matthew	13	52	He said to them , “ Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household , who brings out of his [ f ] treasure things that are new and fresh and things that are old and familiar. ” Jesus Revisits Nazareth

Jesus used it as a symbol for the corrupt and hypocritical teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees ( see especially Luke 12:1 ; cf Matt 16:11 ; Mark 8:15 ) , but He also used leaven ’ s ability to permeate a mass of dough many times its own size as an illustration of the spread of the kingdom of heaven as here and in Luke 13:21 . - Matthew 13:33 A measure was about a peck and a half , which would be enough bread to feed a hundred people . - Matthew 13:52 God ’ s precepts , both the old and the new , contain truths to be treasured .

AMP	Matthew	15	3	He replied to them , “ Why also do you violate the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition [ handed down by the elders ] ?

AMP	Matthew	18	17	If he pays no attention to them [ refusing to listen and obey ] , tell it to the [ e ] church ; and if he refuses to listen even to the church , let him be to you as a Gentile ( unbeliever ) and a tax collector . ( F )

AMP	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came to Him and asked , “ Lord , how many times will my brother sin against me and I forgive him and let it go ? Up to seven times ? ”
AMP	Matthew	18	22	Jesus answered him , “ I say to you , not up to seven times , but seventy times seven .
AMP	Matthew	18	23	“ Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves .
AMP	Matthew	18	24	When he began the accounting , one who owed him 10,000 [ i ] talents was brought to him .
AMP	Matthew	18	25	But because he could not repay , his master ordered him to be sold , with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed , and payment to be made .
AMP	Matthew	18	26	So the slave fell on his knees and begged him , saying , ‘ Have patience with me and I will repay you everything. ’
AMP	Matthew	18	27	And his master ’ s heart was moved with compassion and he released him and forgave him [ canceling ] the debt .
AMP	Matthew	18	28	But that same slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him [ j ] a hundred denarii ; and he seized him and began choking him , saying , ‘ Pay what you owe ! ’

AMP	Matthew	19	19	Honor your father and mother ; and love your neighbor as yourself ” [ that is , unselfishly seek the best or higher good for others ] . ( F )
AMP	Matthew	19	2	and large crowds followed Him , and He healed them there .
AMP	Matthew	19	3	And Pharisees came to Jesus , testing Him and asking , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason ? ”
AMP	Matthew	19	4	He replied , “ Have you never read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female ,
AMP	Matthew	19	5	and said , ‘ For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined inseparably to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh ’ ? ( A )
AMP	Matthew	19	6	So they are no longer two , but one flesh . Therefore , what God has joined together , let no one separate. ”
AMP	Matthew	19	7	The Pharisees said to Him , “ Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away ? ” ( B )
AMP	Matthew	19	8	He said to them , “ Because your hearts were hard and stubborn Moses permitted you to divorce your wives ; but from the beginning it has not been this way .
AMP	Matthew	19	9	I say to you , whoever divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , and marries another woman commits adultery [ a ] . ”
AMP	Matthew	19	10	The disciples said to Jesus , “ If the relationship of a man with his wife is like this , it is better not to marry. ”
AMP	Matthew	19	11	But He said to them , “ Not all men can accept this statement , but only those to whom [ the capacity to receive ] it has been given .
AMP	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs who have been born that way from their mother ’ s womb [ making them incapable of consummating a marriage ] ; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men [ for royal service ] ; and there are eunuchs who have [ b ] made themselves so for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . He who is able to accept this , let him accept it. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children
AMP	Matthew	19	13	Then children were brought to Jesus so that He might place His hands on them [ for a blessing ] and pray ; but the disciples reprimanded them .
AMP	Matthew	19	14	But He said , “ Leave the children alone , and do not forbid them from coming to Me ; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. ”
AMP	Matthew	19	15	After placing His hands on them [ for a blessing ] , He went on from there . The Rich Young Ruler
AMP	Matthew	19	16	And someone came to Him and said , “ Teacher , what [ essentially ] good thing shall I do to obtain eternal life [ that is , eternal salvation in the Messiah ’ s kingdom ] ? ” ( C )
AMP	Matthew	19	17	Jesus answered , “ Why are you asking Me about what is [ essentially ] good ? There is only One who is [ essentially ] good ; but if you wish to enter into eternal life , keep the commandments. ” ( D )
AMP	Matthew	19	18	He said to Jesus , “ Which commandments ? ” And Jesus answered , “ You shall not commit murder ; You shall not commit adultery ; You shall not steal ; You shall not give false testimony ; ( E )
AMP	Matthew	19	20	The young man said to Him , “ I have kept all these things [ from my youth ] ; what do I still lack ? ” ( G )
AMP	Matthew	19	21	Jesus answered him , “ If you wish to be perfect [ that is , have the spiritual maturity that accompanies godly character with no moral or ethical deficiencies ] , go and sell what you have and give [ the money ] to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me [ becoming My disciple , believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk ] . ”
AMP	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard this , he left grieving and distressed , for he owned much property and had many possessions [ which he treasured more than his relationship with God ] .
AMP	Matthew	19	23	Jesus said to His disciples , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , it is difficult for a rich man [ who clings to possessions and status as security ] to enter the kingdom of heaven .
AMP	Matthew	19	24	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man [ who places his faith in wealth and status ] to enter the kingdom of God. ”
AMP	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were completely [ c ] astonished and bewildered , saying , “ Then who can be saved [ from the wrath of God ] ? ”
AMP	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ With people [ as far as it depends on them ] it is impossible , but with God all things are possible. ” ( H ) The Disciples ’ Reward
AMP	Matthew	19	27	Then Peter answered Him , saying , “ Look , we have given up everything and followed You [ becoming Your disciples and accepting You as Teacher and Lord ] ; what then will there be for us ? ”
AMP	Matthew	19	28	Jesus said to them , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , in the renewal [ that is , the Messianic restoration and regeneration of all things ] when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne , you [ who have followed Me , becoming My disciples ] will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
AMP	Matthew	19	29	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother [ d ] or children or farms for My name ’ s sake will receive many times as much , and will inherit eternal life .
AMP	Matthew	19	30	But many who are first [ in this world ] will be last [ in the world to come ] ; and the last , first . Footnotes - Matthew 19:9 Some early mss add the phrase “ ... and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. ” - Matthew 19:12 This may refer to a personal vow of celibacy . - Matthew 19:25 These declarations of Jesus directly contradicted the teaching of the Pharisees that God bestows wealth on those He loves and chooses .

AMP	Matthew	20	2	When he had agreed with the laborers for a [ a ] denarius for the day , he sent them into his vineyard .
AMP	Matthew	20	3	And he went out about the third hour ( 9:00 a.m. ) and saw others standing idle in the market place ;
AMP	Matthew	20	4	and he said to them , ‘ You also go into the vineyard , and I will pay you whatever is right ( an appropriate wage ) . ’ And they went .
AMP	Matthew	20	5	He went out about the sixth hour ( noon ) and the ninth hour ( 3:00 p.m. ) , and did the same thing .

AMP	Matthew	20	7	They answered him , ‘ Because no one hired us. ’ He told them , ‘ You go into the vineyard also. ’
AMP	Matthew	20	8	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his manager , ‘ Call the workers and pay them their wages , beginning with the last [ to be hired ] and ending with the first [ to be hired ] . ’ ( A )
AMP	Matthew	20	9	Those who had been hired at the eleventh hour ( 5:00 p.m. ) came and received a denarius each [ a day ’ s wage ] .
AMP	Matthew	20	10	Now when the first [ to be hired ] came , they thought they would get more ; but each of them also received a denarius .
AMP	Matthew	20	11	When they received it , they protested and grumbled at the owner of the estate ,
AMP	Matthew	20	12	saying , ‘ These men who came last worked [ only ] one hour , and yet you have made them equal [ in wages ] to us who have carried [ most of ] the burden and [ worked in ] the scorching heat of the day. ’
AMP	Matthew	20	13	But the owner of the estate replied to one of them , ‘ Friend , I am doing you no injustice . Did you not agree with me for a denarius ?
AMP	Matthew	20	14	Take what belongs to you and go , but I choose to give to this last man [ hired ] the same as I give to you .
AMP	Matthew	20	15	Am I not lawfully permitted to do what I choose with what is mine ? Or is your eye [ b ] envious because I am generous ? ’
AMP	Matthew	20	16	So those who are last [ in this world ] shall be first [ in the world to come ] , and those who are first , last. ” Death , Resurrection Foretold
AMP	Matthew	20	17	As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , He took the twelve [ disciples ] aside , and along the way He said to them ,
AMP	Matthew	20	18	“ Listen carefully : we are going up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes ( Sanhedrin , Jewish High Court ) , and they will [ judicially ] condemn Him and sentence Him to death ,
AMP	Matthew	20	19	and will hand Him over to the Gentiles ( Roman authorities ) to be mocked and scourged and crucified , and He will be raised [ to life ] on the third day. ” Preferred Treatment Asked
AMP	Matthew	20	21	And He said to her , “ What do you wish ? ” She answered Him , “ Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit [ in positions of honor and authority ] one on Your right and one on Your left. ”
AMP	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus replied , “ You do not realize what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup [ of suffering ] that I am about to drink ? ” They answered , “ We are able. ”
AMP	Matthew	20	23	He said to them , “ You will drink My cup [ of suffering ] ; but to sit on My right and on My left this is not Mine to give , but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father. ”
AMP	Matthew	20	24	And when the [ other ] ten heard this , they were resentful and angry with the two brothers .
AMP	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them to Himself and said , “ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles have absolute power and lord it over them , and their great men exercise authority over them [ tyrannizing them ] . ( C )
AMP	Matthew	20	26	It is not this way among you , but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant ,
AMP	Matthew	20	27	and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your [ willing and humble ] slave ;
AMP	Matthew	20	28	just as the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life as a ransom for many [ paying the price to set them free from the penalty of sin ] . ” Sight for the Blind
AMP	Matthew	20	29	As they were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed Him . ( D )
AMP	Matthew	20	30	And two blind men were sitting by the road , and when they heard that Jesus was passing by , they cried out , “ Lord , have mercy on us , Son of David ( Messiah ) ! ”
AMP	Matthew	20	31	The crowd sternly told them to be quiet , but they cried out all the more , “ Lord , Son of David ( Messiah ) have mercy on us ! ”
AMP	Matthew	20	32	Jesus stopped and called them , and asked , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”

AMP	Matthew	21	21	Jesus replied to them , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , if you have faith [ personal trust and confidence in Me ] and do not doubt or allow yourself to be drawn in two directions , you will not only do what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be taken up and thrown into the sea , ’ it will happen [ if God wills it ] .

AMP	Matthew	21	4	This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet would be fulfilled , saying :
AMP	Matthew	21	5	“ Tell the daughter of Zion ( the people of Jerusalem ) , ‘ Behold , your King is coming to you , Gentle and mounted on a donkey , Even on a colt , the foal of a beast of burden. ’ ” ( B )
AMP	Matthew	21	6	Then the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them ,
AMP	Matthew	21	7	and they brought the donkey and [ a ] the colt , and [ b ] placed their coats on them ; and Jesus sat on the coats .
AMP	Matthew	21	8	Most of the crowd spread their coats on the road [ as before a king ] , while others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road .
AMP	Matthew	21	9	The crowds that went ahead of Him , and those that followed Him , were shouting [ in praise and adoration ] , “ [ c ] Hosanna to the Son of David ( Messiah ) ; Blessed [ praised , glorified ] is He who comes in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest [ heaven ] ! ” ( C )
AMP	Matthew	21	10	When He entered Jerusalem , all the city was trembling [ with excitement ] , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
AMP	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds were saying , “ This is the prophet Jesus , from Nazareth in Galilee. ” Cleansing the Temple
AMP	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus entered the temple [ grounds ] and drove out [ with force ] all who were buying and selling [ birds and animals for sacrifice ] in the temple area , and He turned over the tables of the moneychangers [ who made a profit exchanging foreign money for temple coinage ] and the chairs of those who were selling doves [ for sacrifice ] . ( D )
AMP	Matthew	21	13	Jesus said to them , “ It is written [ in Scripture ] , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer ’ ; but you are making it a robbers ’ den. ” ( E )
AMP	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to Him in [ the porticoes and courts of ] the temple area , and He healed them .
AMP	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful and miraculous things that Jesus had done , and heard the [ d ] boys who were shouting in [ the porticoes and courts of ] the temple [ in praise and adoration ] , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ( the Messiah ) , ” they became indignant
AMP	Matthew	21	16	and they said to Him , “ Do You hear what these children are saying ? ” And Jesus replied to them , “ Yes ; have you never read [ in the Scripture ] , ‘ Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared and provided praise for Yourself ’ ? ” ( F )

AMP	Matthew	21	18	Now early in the morning , as Jesus was coming back to the city , He was hungry . ( G )
AMP	Matthew	21	19	Seeing a lone fig tree at the roadside , He went to it and found nothing but leaves on it ; and He said to it , “ Never again will fruit come from you. ” And at once the fig tree withered .
AMP	Matthew	21	20	When the disciples saw it , they were astonished and asked , “ How is it that the fig tree has withered away all at once ? ”
AMP	Matthew	21	22	And whatever you ask for in prayer , believing , you will receive. ” Authority Challenged
AMP	Matthew	21	23	When He entered the temple area , the [ e ] chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and said , “ By what [ kind of ] authority are You doing these things , and who gave You this authority [ to exercise this power ] ? ” ( I )
AMP	Matthew	21	24	Jesus replied to them , “ I will also ask you a question , and if you tell Me the answer , then I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
AMP	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John—from where did it come ? From heaven [ that is , ordained by God ] or from men ? ” And they began debating among themselves [ considering the implications of their answer ] , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe John ? ’
AMP	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we are afraid of the [ response of the ] crowd ; for they all regard John as a prophet. ”
AMP	Matthew	21	27	So they answered Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And He said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what [ kind of ] authority I do these things. ” Parable of Two Sons
AMP	Matthew	21	28	“ What do you think ? There was a man who had two sons , and he came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go and work in the vineyard today. ’

AMP	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of the father ? ” The chief priests and elders replied , “ The first one. ” Jesus said to them , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you .
AMP	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you [ walking ] in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him ; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him ; and you , seeing this , did not even change your mind afterward and believe him [ accepting what he proclaimed to you ] . Parable of the Landowner
AMP	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to another parable . There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a wall around it and dug a wine press in it , and built a tower , and rented it out to tenant farmers and went on a journey [ to another country ] . ( J )
AMP	Matthew	21	34	When the harvest time approached , he sent his servants to the tenants to get his [ share of the ] fruit .
AMP	Matthew	21	35	But the tenants took his servants and beat one , and killed another , and stoned a third .
AMP	Matthew	21	36	Again he sent other servants , more than the first time ; and they treated them the same way .
AMP	Matthew	21	37	Finally he sent his own son to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son and have regard for him. ’
AMP	Matthew	21	38	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to themselves , ‘ This [ man ] is the heir ; come on , let us kill him and seize his inheritance. ’
AMP	Matthew	21	39	So they took the son and threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
AMP	Matthew	21	40	Now when the owner of the vineyard comes back , what will he do to those tenants ? ”
AMP	Matthew	21	41	They said to Him , “ He will put those despicable men to a miserable end , and rent out the vineyard to other tenants [ of good character ] who will pay him the proceeds at the proper seasons. ”
AMP	Matthew	21	42	Jesus asked them , “ Have you never read in the Scriptures : ‘ The [ very ] [ f ] Stone which the builders rejected and threw away , Has become the chief Cornerstone ; This is the Lord ’ s doing , And it is marvelous and wonderful in our eyes ’ ? ( K )
AMP	Matthew	21	43	Therefore I tell you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to [ another ] people who will produce the fruit of it .
AMP	Matthew	21	44	And he who falls on this Stone will be broken to pieces ; but he on whom it falls will be crushed. ” ( L )
AMP	Matthew	21	45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables , they understood that He was talking about them .
AMP	Matthew	21	46	And although they were trying to arrest Him , they feared the people , because they regarded Jesus as a prophet .

AMP	Matthew	22	2	“ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son .
AMP	Matthew	22	3	And he sent his servants to call those who had [ previously ] been invited to the wedding feast , but they refused to come .
AMP	Matthew	22	4	Then he sent out some other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , “ Look , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and fattened calves are butchered and everything is ready ; come to the wedding feast. ” ’
AMP	Matthew	22	5	But they paid no attention [ they disregarded the invitation , treating it with contempt ] and went away , one to his farm , another to his business .
AMP	Matthew	22	6	The rest [ of the invited guests ] seized his servants and mistreated them [ insulting and humiliating them ] and killed them .
AMP	Matthew	22	7	The king was enraged [ when he heard this ] , and sent his soldiers and destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
AMP	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding [ feast ] is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy .
AMP	Matthew	22	9	So go to the main highways that lead out of the city , and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find. ’
AMP	Matthew	22	10	Those servants went out into the streets and gathered together all the people they could find , both bad and good ; so the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests [ sitting at the banquet table ] .
AMP	Matthew	22	11	“ But when the king came in to see the dinner guests , he saw a man there who was not dressed [ appropriately ] in wedding clothes ,
AMP	Matthew	22	12	and he said , ‘ Friend , how did you come in here without wearing the wedding clothes [ that were provided for you ] ? ’ And the man was speechless and without excuse .
AMP	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the attendants , ‘ Tie him hand and foot , and throw him into the darkness outside ; in that place there will be weeping [ over sorrow and pain ] and grinding of teeth [ over distress and anger ] . ’

AMP	Matthew	22	17	Tell us then , what do You think ? Is it permissible [ according to Jewish law and tradition ] to pay a [ b ] poll-tax to Caesar , or not ? ”
AMP	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus , aware of their malice , asked , “ Why are you testing Me , you hypocrites ?
AMP	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin used for the poll-tax. ” And they brought Him a denarius [ a day ’ s wage ] .

AMP	Matthew	22	23	On that day some Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection [ of the dead ] , came to Him and asked Him a question , ( B )
AMP	Matthew	22	24	saying , “ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ If a man dies , leaving no children , his brother as next of kin shall [ d ] marry his widow , and raise children for his brother. ’ ( C )
AMP	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us ; the first married and died , and having no children left his wife to his brother .
AMP	Matthew	22	26	The second also [ died childless ] , and the third , down to the seventh .
AMP	Matthew	22	27	Last of all , the woman died .
AMP	Matthew	22	28	So in the resurrection , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had married her. ”
AMP	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus replied to them , “ You are all wrong because you know neither the Scriptures [ which teach the resurrection ] nor the power of God [ for He is able to raise the dead ] .
AMP	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage , but they are like angels in heaven [ who do not marry nor produce children ] .
AMP	Matthew	22	31	But as to the resurrection of the dead—have you not read [ in the Scripture ] what God said to you :
AMP	Matthew	22	32	‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead , but of the living. ” ( D )

The terms “ Passover ” and “ The Feast of Unleavened Bread ” were used interchangeably . - Matthew 26:18 Tradition identifies this man as Mark ’ s father . - Matthew 26:23 In the ancient culture sharing a meal in this way was a confirmation of friendship and goodwill . - Matthew 26:25 “ You ” is emphatic in the Greek text . - Matthew 26:26 The customary blessing spoken over the bread in the Passover meal was , “ Blessed are you , O Lord our God , King of the universe , who brings forth bread from the earth. ” - Matthew 26:27 Giving thanks consisted of two benedictions , one over the wine ( “ Blessed are You , Lord our God , who has created the fruit of the vine ! ” ) and one for the return of the Feast Day with all it implied , as well as being allowed once more to witness it . - Matthew 26:28 By laying his hands on the head of the sacrifice the one offering the sacrifice identified himself with it and through its death it became an atonement or covering for his sin . Because the unblemished sacrifice “ covered ” his sin , it placed the one offering the sacrifice in a right relationship with God , just as later under the new covenant the perfection and sacrifice of Christ would cover ( atone for ) the imperfection and sin of those who identified with Him and accepted Him as Savior . - Matthew 26:30 The Hallel psalms ( 113-118 ) were sung at Passover . - Matthew 26:36 This beautiful garden filled with now ancient olive trees still exists . - Matthew 26:39 Jesus ’ request was heard ( Heb 5:7 ) , and it is unlikely that He asked to avoid the cross .

In that case , the “ cup ” would represent His body ’ s remaining in the grave , which would be contrary to the plan of salvation and prophecy regarding His resurrection ( Ps 16:10 ; cf Acts 2:24-27 ) . Others think that the request related to the time of separation from the Father , which He would have to endure in death ( see 27:46 ) .

AMP	Matthew	27	12	But when the charges were brought against Him by the chief priests and elders , He did not answer . ( E )
AMP	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said to Him , “ Do You not hear how many things they are testifying against You ? ”
AMP	Matthew	27	14	But Jesus did not reply to him , not even to a single accusation , so that the governor was greatly astonished .
AMP	Matthew	27	15	Now at the feast [ of the Passover ] the governor was in the habit of setting free any one prisoner whom the people chose . ( F )
AMP	Matthew	27	16	And at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner [ guilty of insurrection and murder ] , called Barabbas .
AMP	Matthew	27	17	So when they had assembled [ for this purpose ] , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to set free for you ? Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
AMP	Matthew	27	18	For Pilate knew that it was because of jealousy that the chief priests and elders had handed Jesus over to him .
AMP	Matthew	27	19	While he was seated on the judgment seat , his wife sent him a message , saying , “ Have nothing to do with that righteous and innocent Man ; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him. ”
AMP	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death .
AMP	Matthew	27	21	The governor said to them , “ Which of the two do you wish me to set free for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas. ”
AMP	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them , “ Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ” They all replied , “ Let Him be crucified ! ”
AMP	Matthew	27	23	And he said , “ Why , what has He done that is evil ? ” But they continued shouting all the louder , “ Let Him be crucified ! ” ( G )
AMP	Matthew	27	24	So when Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere , but rather that a riot was breaking out , he took water and washed his hands [ to ceremonially cleanse himself of guilt ] in the presence of the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of this [ righteous ] Man ’ s blood ; see to that yourselves. ” ( H )
AMP	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answered , “ Let [ the responsibility for ] His blood be on us and on our children ! ” ( I )

AMP	Matthew	27	32	Now as they were coming out , they found a man of [ d ] Cyrene named [ e ] Simon , whom they forced into service [ f ] to carry the cross of Jesus . ( K ) The Crucifixion
AMP	Matthew	27	33	And when they came to a place called Golgotha , which means [ g ] Place of a Skull , ( L )
AMP	Matthew	27	34	they offered Him wine mixed with gall ( myrrh , a bitter-tasting narcotic ) to drink ; but after tasting it , He refused to drink it .

AMP	Matthew	27	40	and they said [ tauntingly ] , “ You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save Yourself [ from death ] ! If You are the Son of God , come down from the cross. ”
AMP	Matthew	27	41	In the same way the chief priests also , along with the scribes and elders , mocked Him , saying ,

AMP	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut in the rock ; and he rolled a large stone over the entrance of the tomb and went away .
AMP	Matthew	27	61	And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other [ q ] Mary , sitting opposite the tomb .
AMP	Matthew	27	62	The next day , that is , the day after the [ day of ] preparation [ for the Sabbath ] , the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate ,
AMP	Matthew	27	63	and said , “ Sir , we have remembered that when He was still alive that deceiver said , ‘ After three days I will rise [ from the dead ] . ’
AMP	Matthew	27	64	Therefore , give orders to have the tomb made secure and safeguarded until the third day , otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people , ‘ He has risen from the dead , ’ and the last deception [ the reporting of His resurrection ] will be worse than the first [ the reporting that He is the Messiah ] . ”
AMP	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You have a guard [ of soldiers ] ; go [ with them ] , make the tomb as secure as you know how. ”

AMP	Mark	1	16	As Jesus was walking by the shore of the [ j ] Sea of Galilee , He saw Simon [ Peter ] and Simon ’ s brother , [ k ] Andrew , casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishermen .

AMP	Mark	1	23	Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out [ terribly from the depths of his throat ] ,

AMP	Mark	2	3	Then they came , bringing to Him a paralyzed man , who was being carried by four men . ( B )
AMP	Mark	2	4	When they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd , they [ a ] removed the roof above Jesus ; and when they had dug out an opening , they let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying .
AMP	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their [ active ] faith [ springing from confidence in Him ] , He said to the paralyzed man , “ Son , your sins are forgiven. ”
AMP	Mark	2	6	But some of the [ b ] scribes were sitting there debating in their hearts [ the implication of what He had said ] ,
AMP	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man talk that way ? He is blaspheming ; who can forgive sins [ remove guilt , nullify sin ’ s penalty , and assign righteousness ] except God alone ? ”
AMP	Mark	2	8	Immediately Jesus , being fully aware [ of their hostility ] and knowing in His spirit that they were thinking this , said to them , “ Why are you debating and arguing about these things in your hearts ?
AMP	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven ’ ; or to say , ‘ Get up , and pick up your mat and walk ’ ?

( C )
AMP	Mark	2	15	And it happened that Jesus was [ e ] reclining at the table in Levi ’ s house , and many tax collectors and sinners [ including non-observant Jews ] were eating with Him and His disciples ; for there were many of them and they were [ f ] following Him .
AMP	Mark	2	16	When the scribes [ belonging to the sect ] of the [ g ] Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with the sinners [ including non-observant Jews ] and tax collectors , they asked His disciples , “ Why does He eat and drink with [ h ] tax collectors and sinners ? ”
AMP	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard this , He said to them , “ Those who are healthy have no need of a physician , but [ only ] those who are sick ; I did not come to call the righteous , but sinners [ who recognize their sin and humbly seek forgiveness ] . ”
AMP	Mark	2	18	Now John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting [ as a ritual ] ; and they came and asked Jesus , “ Why are John ’ s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fasting , but Your disciples are not doing so ? ”
AMP	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered , “ The attendants of the bridegroom [ i ] can not fast while the bridegroom is [ still ] with them , can they ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .

AMP	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to Him , “ Look , why are they doing what [ l ] is unlawful on the Sabbath ? ”
AMP	Mark	2	25	Jesus said to them , “ Have you never read [ in the Scriptures ] what David did when he was in need and was hungry , he and his companions ; ( E )
AMP	Mark	2	26	how he went into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest , and ate the sacred bread , which is not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat , and how he also gave it to the men who were with him ? ” ( F )

AMP	Mark	4	11	He said to them , “ The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you [ who have teachable hearts ] , but those who are outside [ the unbelievers , the spiritually blind ] get everything in parables ,

AMP	Mark	4	13	Then He said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How will you understand and grasp the meaning of all the parables ? ( C )
AMP	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the word [ of God , the good news regarding the way of salvation ] .
AMP	Mark	4	15	These [ in the first group ] are the ones along the road where the word is sown ; but when they hear , Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them .
AMP	Mark	4	16	In a similar way these [ in the second group ] are the ones on whom seed was sown on rocky ground , who , when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy [ but accept it only superficially ] ;
AMP	Mark	4	17	and they have no real root in themselves , so they endure only for a little while ; then , when trouble or persecution comes because of the word , immediately they [ are offended and displeased at being associated with Me and ] stumble and fall away .
AMP	Mark	4	18	And others are the ones on whom seed was sown among the thorns ; these are the ones who have heard the word ,
AMP	Mark	4	19	but the worries and cares of the world [ the distractions of this age with its worldly pleasures ] , and the deceitfulness [ and the false security or glamour ] of wealth [ or fame ] , and the passionate desires for all the other things creep in and choke out the word , and it becomes unfruitful .
AMP	Mark	4	20	And those [ in the last group ] are the ones on whom seed was sown on the good soil ; and they hear the word [ of God , the good news regarding the way of salvation ] and accept it and bear fruit—thirty , sixty , and a hundred times as much [ as was sown ] . ”
AMP	Mark	4	21	He said to them , “ A lamp is not brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed , is it ? Is it not [ brought in ] to be put on the lampstand ? ( D )
AMP	Mark	4	22	For nothing is hidden , except to be revealed ; nor has anything been kept secret , but that it would come to light [ that is , things are hidden only temporarily , until the appropriate time comes for them to be known ] . ( E )
AMP	Mark	4	23	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear and heed My words. ”
AMP	Mark	4	24	Then He said to them , “ Pay attention to what you hear . By your own standard of measurement [ that is , to the extent that you study spiritual truth and apply godly wisdom ] it will be measured to you [ and you will be given even greater ability to respond ] —and more will be given to you besides .
AMP	Mark	4	25	For [ b ] whoever has [ a teachable heart ] , to him more [ understanding ] will be given ; and whoever does not have [ a yearning for truth ] , even what he has will be taken away from him. ” ( F ) Parable of the Seed
AMP	Mark	4	26	Then He said , “ The kingdom of God is like a man who throws seed on the ground ;

AMP	Mark	4	30	And He said , “ How shall we [ c ] picture the kingdom of God , or what parable shall we use to illustrate and explain it ? ( G )
AMP	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed , which , when it is sown on the ground , even though it is [ d ] smaller than all the [ other ] seeds that are [ sown ] on the soil ,
AMP	Mark	4	32	yet when it is sown , it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs ; and it puts out large branches , so that the birds of the sky are able to make nests and live under its shade. ” ( H )
AMP	Mark	4	33	With many such parables , Jesus spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear and understand it ;
AMP	Mark	4	34	and He did not say anything to them without [ using ] a parable ; He did , however , explain everything privately to His own disciples . Jesus Stills the Sea
AMP	Mark	4	35	On that [ same ] day , when evening had come , He said to them , “ Let us go over to the other side [ of the Sea of Galilee ] . ”
AMP	Mark	4	36	So leaving the crowd , they took Him with them , just as He was , in the boat . And other boats were with Him . ( I )
AMP	Mark	4	37	And a [ e ] fierce windstorm began to blow , and waves were breaking over the boat , so that it was already being swamped .
AMP	Mark	4	38	But Jesus was in the stern , asleep [ with His head ] on the [ sailor ’ s leather ] cushion . And they woke Him and said to Him , “ Teacher , do You not care that we are about to die ? ”
AMP	Mark	4	39	And He got up and [ sternly ] rebuked the wind and said to the sea , “ Hush , be still ( muzzled ) ! ” And the wind died down [ as if it had grown weary ] and there was [ at once ] a great calm [ a perfect peacefulness ] .
AMP	Mark	4	40	Jesus said to them , “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still have no faith and confidence [ in Me ] ? ”
AMP	Mark	4	41	They were filled with great fear , and said to each other , “ Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey Him ? ” Footnotes - Mark 4:5 In many parts of Israel a layer of limestone lies an inch or so beneath the surface of the ground .

AMP	Mark	5	5	Night and day he was constantly screaming and shrieking among the tombs and on the mountains , and cutting himself with [ sharp ] stones .
AMP	Mark	5	2	When Jesus got out of the boat , immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him ,
AMP	Mark	5	3	and the man lived in the [ b ] tombs , and no one could bind him anymore , not even with chains .
AMP	Mark	5	4	For he had often been bound with shackles [ for the feet ] and with chains , and he tore apart the chains and broke the shackles into pieces , and no one was strong enough to subdue and tame him .
AMP	Mark	5	6	Seeing Jesus from a distance , he ran up and bowed down before Him [ in homage ] ;
AMP	Mark	5	7	and screaming with a loud voice , he said , “ [ c ] What business do we have in common with each other , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I implore you by God [ swear to me ] , do not torment me ! ” ( B )
AMP	Mark	5	8	For Jesus had been saying to him , “ Come out of the man , you unclean spirit ! ”
AMP	Mark	5	9	He was asking him , “ What is your name ? ” And he replied , “ My name is Legion ; for we are many. ”
AMP	Mark	5	10	And he began begging Him repeatedly not to send them out of the region .
AMP	Mark	5	11	Now there was a large herd of pigs grazing there on the mountain .
AMP	Mark	5	12	And the demons begged Him , saying , “ Send us to the pigs so that we may go into them ! ”
AMP	Mark	5	13	Jesus gave them permission . And the unclean spirits came out [ of the man ] and entered the pigs . The herd , numbering about two thousand , rushed down the steep bank into the sea ; and they were drowned [ one after the other ] in the sea .
AMP	Mark	5	14	The herdsmen [ tending the pigs ] ran away and reported it in the city and in the country . And the people came to see what had happened .
AMP	Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down , clothed and in his right mind , the man who had [ previously ] had the “ legion ” [ of demons ] ; and they were frightened .
AMP	Mark	5	16	Those who had seen it described [ in detail ] to the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man , and [ told them all ] about the pigs .
AMP	Mark	5	17	So the people began to beg with Jesus to leave their region .
AMP	Mark	5	18	As He was stepping into the boat , the [ Gentile ] man who had been demon-possessed was begging with Him [ asking ] that he might go with Him [ as a disciple ] .
AMP	Mark	5	19	Jesus did not let him [ come ] , but [ instead ] He said to him , “ Go home to your family and tell them all the great things that the Lord has done for you , and how He has had mercy on you. ”
AMP	Mark	5	20	So he [ obeyed and ] went away and began to publicly proclaim in Decapolis [ the region of the ten Hellenistic cities ] all the great things that Jesus had done for him ; and all the people were astonished . Miracles and Healing
AMP	Mark	5	21	When Jesus had again crossed over in the boat to the other side [ of the sea ] , a large crowd gathered around Him ; and so He stayed by the seashore .
AMP	Mark	5	22	One of the synagogue officials named Jairus came up ; and seeing Him , fell at His feet ( C )
AMP	Mark	5	23	and begged anxiously with Him , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death ; [ please ] come and lay Your hands on her , so that she will be healed and live. ”
AMP	Mark	5	24	And Jesus went with him ; and a large crowd followed Him and pressed in around Him [ from all sides ] .
AMP	Mark	5	25	A woman [ in the crowd ] had [ suffered from ] a hemorrhage for twelve years ,
AMP	Mark	5	26	and had endured much [ suffering ] at the hands of many physicians . She had spent all that she had and was not helped at all , but instead had become worse .
AMP	Mark	5	27	She had heard [ reports ] about Jesus , and she came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His outer robe .
AMP	Mark	5	28	For she thought , “ If I just touch His clothing , I will get well. ”
AMP	Mark	5	29	Immediately her flow of blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body [ and knew without any doubt ] that she was healed of her suffering .
AMP	Mark	5	30	Immediately Jesus , recognizing in Himself that power had gone out from Him , turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched My clothes ? ”
AMP	Mark	5	31	His disciples said to Him , “ You see the crowd pressing in around You [ from all sides ] , and You ask , ‘ Who touched Me ? ’ ”
AMP	Mark	5	32	Still He kept looking around to see the woman who had done it .
AMP	Mark	5	33	And the woman , though she was afraid and trembling , aware of what had happened to her , came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth .
AMP	Mark	5	34	Then He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith [ your personal trust and confidence in Me ] has restored you to health ; go in peace and be [ permanently ] healed from your suffering. ”
AMP	Mark	5	35	While He was still speaking , some people came from the synagogue official ’ s house , saying [ to Jairus ] , “ Your daughter has died ; why bother the Teacher any longer ? ”
AMP	Mark	5	36	Overhearing what was being said , Jesus said to the synagogue official , “ Do not be afraid ; only keep on believing [ in Me and my power ] . ”
AMP	Mark	5	37	And He allowed no one to go with Him [ as witnesses ] , except Peter and [ d ] James and John the brother of James .
AMP	Mark	5	38	They came to the house of the synagogue official ; and He looked [ with understanding ] at the uproar and commotion , and people loudly weeping and wailing [ in mourning ] .
AMP	Mark	5	39	When He had gone in , He said to them , “ Why make a commotion and weep ? The child has not died , but is sleeping. ”
AMP	Mark	5	40	They began laughing [ scornfully ] at Him [ because they knew the child was dead ] . But He made them all [ e ] go outside , and took along the child ’ s father and mother and His own [ three ] companions , and entered the room where the child was .
AMP	Mark	5	41	Taking the child ’ s hand , He said [ tenderly ] to her , “ Talitha kum ! ” —which translated [ from Aramaic ] means , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up ! ”
AMP	Mark	5	42	The little girl immediately got up and began to walk , for she was twelve years old . And immediately they [ who witnessed the child ’ s resurrection ] were overcome with great wonder and utter amazement .
AMP	Mark	5	43	He gave strict orders that no one should know about this , and He told them to give her something to eat .

AMP	Mark	6	6	He wondered at their unbelief . And He was going around in the villages teaching . The Twelve Sent Out
AMP	Mark	6	2	When the Sabbath came , He began to teach in the synagogue ; and many who listened to Him were astonished , saying , “ Where did this man get these things [ this knowledge and spiritual insight ] ? What is this wisdom [ this confident understanding of the Scripture ] that has been given to Him , and such miracles as these performed by His hands ?
AMP	Mark	6	3	Is this not the carpenter , [ a ] the son of Mary , and the brother of [ b ] James and Joses and [ c ] Judas and Simon ? Are His sisters not here with us ? ” And they were [ deeply ] offended by Him [ and their disapproval blinded them to the fact that He was anointed by God as the Messiah ] .
AMP	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor ( respect ) except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household. ”
AMP	Mark	6	5	And He could not do a miracle there at all [ because of their unbelief ] except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them .
AMP	Mark	6	7	And He called the twelve [ disciples ] and began to send them out [ as His special messengers ] two by two , and gave them authority and power over the unclean spirits .
AMP	Mark	6	8	He told them to take nothing for the journey except a mere walking stick—no bread , no [ traveler ’ s ] bag , no money in their belts—
AMP	Mark	6	9	but to wear sandals ; and [ He told them ] not to wear [ d ] two tunics .
AMP	Mark	6	10	And He told them , “ Wherever you go into a house , stay there until you leave that town .
AMP	Mark	6	11	Any place that does not welcome you or listen to you , when you leave there , [ e ] shake the dust off the soles of your feet as a testimony against them [ breaking all ties with them because they rejected My message ] . ” ( B )
AMP	Mark	6	12	So they went out and preached that men should repent [ that is , think differently , recognize sin , turn away from it , and live changed lives ] .
AMP	Mark	6	13	And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with oil many who were sick , and healing them . John ’ s Fate Recalled
AMP	Mark	6	14	King Herod [ Antipas ] heard about this , for Jesus ’ name and reputation had become well known . People were saying , “ John the Baptist has been raised from the dead , and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in Him. ”
AMP	Mark	6	15	But others were saying , “ He is [ f ] Elijah ! ” And others were saying , “ It is a prophet , like one of the prophets [ of old ] . ”
AMP	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard [ of it ] , he kept saying , “ John , whom I beheaded , has risen [ from the dead ] ! ”
AMP	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent [ guards ] and had John arrested and shackled in prison because of [ g ] Herodias , the wife of his [ half- ] brother Philip , because he ( Herod ) had married her . ( C )
AMP	Mark	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod , “ It is not lawful [ under Mosaic Law ] for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ” ( D )
AMP	Mark	6	19	Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted to kill him , but she could not ,
AMP	Mark	6	20	because Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and he continually kept him safe . When he heard John [ speak ] , he was very perplexed ; but he enjoyed listening to him .
AMP	Mark	6	21	But an opportune time [ finally ] came [ for Herodias ] . Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his officials ( nobles , courtiers ) and [ h ] military commanders and the leading men of Galilee .
AMP	Mark	6	22	Now [ Salome ] the daughter of Herodias came in and danced [ for the men ] . She pleased and beguiled Herod and his dinner guests ; and the king said to the [ i ] girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you. ”
AMP	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her , “ Whatever you ask me , I will give it to you ; [ j ] up to half of my kingdom. ” ( E )
AMP	Mark	6	24	She went out and said to her mother , “ What shall I ask for ? ” And Herodias replied , “ The head of John the Baptist ! ”
AMP	Mark	6	25	And she rushed back to the king and asked , saying , “ I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter ! ”
AMP	Mark	6	26	The king was deeply grieved , but because of his oaths and his dinner guests [ who might have regarded him as weak ] , he was unwilling to [ break his word and ] refuse her .
AMP	Mark	6	27	So the king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring back John ’ s head . And he went and had John beheaded in the prison ,
AMP	Mark	6	28	and brought back his head on a platter , and gave it to the girl ; and the girl gave it to her mother .
AMP	Mark	6	29	When his disciples heard about this , they came and took away John ’ s body and laid it in a tomb . Five Thousand Fed
AMP	Mark	6	30	The apostles [ who had been sent out on a mission ] gathered together with Jesus and told Him everything that they had done and taught .
AMP	Mark	6	31	He said to them , “ Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little while ” —for there were many [ people who were continually ] coming and going , and they could not even find time to eat .
AMP	Mark	6	32	And they went away by themselves in the boat to a secluded place . ( F )
AMP	Mark	6	33	Many [ people ] saw them leaving , and recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the [ surrounding ] cities , and got there ahead of them .
AMP	Mark	6	34	When Jesus went ashore , He saw a large crowd [ waiting ] , and He was moved with compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd [ lacking guidance ] ; and He began to teach them many things .
AMP	Mark	6	35	When the day was nearly gone , His disciples came to Him and said , “ This is an isolated place , and it is already late ;
AMP	Mark	6	36	send the crowds away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat. ”
AMP	Mark	6	37	But He replied , “ You give them something to eat ! ” And they asked Him , “ Shall we go and buy
AMP	Mark	6	200	[ k ] denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat ? ” ( G )
AMP	Mark	6	38	He said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go look ! ” And when they found out , they said , “ Five [ loaves ] , and two fish. ”
AMP	Mark	6	39	Then Jesus commanded them all to sit down by groups on the green grass .
AMP	Mark	6	40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and of fifties [ so that the crowd resembled an orderly arrangement of colorful garden plots ] .
AMP	Mark	6	41	Taking the five loaves and two fish , He looked up to heaven and said a blessing [ of praise and thanksgiving to the Father ] . Then He broke the loaves and [ repeatedly ] gave them to the disciples to set before the people ; and He divided up the two fish among them all .
AMP	Mark	6	42	They all ate and were satisfied .
AMP	Mark	6	43	And the disciples picked up twelve full baskets of the broken pieces [ of the loaves ] , and of the fish .
AMP	Mark	6	44	Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men [ not counting the women and children ] . Jesus Walks on the Water
AMP	Mark	6	45	Jesus immediately insisted that His disciples get into the boat and go ahead [ of Him ] to the other side to Bethsaida , while He was dismissing the crowd . ( H )
AMP	Mark	6	46	And after He said goodbye to them , He went to the mountain to pray .
AMP	Mark	6	47	Now when evening had come , the boat was in the middle of the sea , and Jesus was alone on the land .
AMP	Mark	6	48	Seeing the disciples straining at the oars , because the wind was against them , at about the fourth watch of the night ( 3:00-6:00 a.m. ) He came to them , walking on the sea . And [ acted as if ] He intended to pass by them . ( I )
AMP	Mark	6	49	But when they saw Him walking on the sea , they thought it was a ghost , and cried out [ in horror ] ;
AMP	Mark	6	50	for they all saw Him and were shaken and terrified . But He immediately spoke with them and said , “ Take courage ! It is I ( I Am ) ! Stop being afraid. ” ( J )
AMP	Mark	6	51	Then He got into the boat with them , and the wind ceased [ as if exhausted by its own activity ] ; and they were completely overwhelmed ,
AMP	Mark	6	52	because they had not understood [ the miracle of ] the loaves [ how it revealed the power and deity of Jesus ] ; but [ in fact ] their heart was hardened [ being oblivious and indifferent to His amazing works ] . Healing at Gennesaret
AMP	Mark	6	53	When they had crossed over [ the sea ] , they reached the land of Gennesaret and anchored at the shore .
AMP	Mark	6	54	They got out of the boat and immediately people recognized Him ,
AMP	Mark	6	55	and ran throughout that surrounding countryside and began to carry around on their mats those who were sick , to any place where they heard He was .
AMP	Mark	6	56	And wherever He came into villages , or cities , or the countryside , they were laying the sick in the market places and pleading with Him [ to allow them ] just to touch the fringe ( tassel with a blue cord ) of His robe ; and all who touched it were healed .

AMP	Mark	7	7	‘ They worship Me in vain [ their worship is meaningless and worthless , a pretense ] , Teaching the precepts of men as doctrines [ giving their traditions equal weight with the Scriptures ] . ’ ( A )
AMP	Mark	7	2	and they had seen that some of His disciples ate their bread with [ ceremonially ] impure hands , that is , unwashed [ and defiled according to Jewish religious ritual ] .
AMP	Mark	7	3	( [ a ] For the Pharisees and all of the Jews do not eat unless they [ b ] carefully wash their hands , holding firmly to the traditions of the elders ;
AMP	Mark	7	4	and when they come from the market place , they do not eat unless they [ c ] cleanse themselves [ completely according to ritual ] ; and there are many other things [ oral , man-made laws and traditions handed down to them ] which they follow diligently , such as the washing of cups and pitchers and copper utensils . )
AMP	Mark	7	5	So the Pharisees and scribes asked Jesus , “ Why do Your disciples not live their lives according to the tradition of the elders , but [ instead ] eat their bread with [ ceremonially ] unwashed hands ? ”
AMP	Mark	7	6	He replied , “ Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites ( play-actors , pretenders ) , as it is written [ in Scripture ] , ‘ These people honor Me with their lips , But their heart is far from Me .
AMP	Mark	7	8	You disregard and neglect the commandment of God , and cling [ faithfully ] to the tradition of men. ”
AMP	Mark	7	9	He was also saying to them , “ You are experts at setting aside and nullifying the commandment of God in order to keep your [ man-made ] tradition and regulations .
AMP	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother [ with respect and gratitude ] ’ ; and , ‘ He who speaks evil of his father or mother must be put to death ’ ; ( B )
AMP	Mark	7	11	but you [ Pharisees and scribes ] say , ‘ If a man tells his father or mother , “ Whatever I have that would help you is Corban , ( that is to say , already a gift to God ) , ” ’
AMP	Mark	7	12	then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother [ since helping them would violate his vow of Corban ] ;
AMP	Mark	7	13	so you nullify the [ authority of the ] word of God [ acting as if it did not apply ] because of your tradition which you have handed down [ through the elders ] . And you do many things such as that. ” The Heart of Man
AMP	Mark	7	14	After He called the people to Him again , He began saying to them , “ Listen [ carefully ] to Me , all of you , [ hear ] and understand [ what I am saying ] :
AMP	Mark	7	15	there is nothing outside a man [ such as food ] which by going into him can defile him [ morally or spiritually ] ; but the things which come out of [ the heart of ] a man are what defile and dishonor him .
AMP	Mark	7	16	[ d ] [ If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear. ” ]
AMP	Mark	7	17	When Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the [ e ] house , His disciples asked Him about the parable .
AMP	Mark	7	18	And He said to them , “ Are you , too , so foolish and lacking in understanding ? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the man from outside can not defile and dishonor him ,
AMP	Mark	7	19	since it does not enter his heart , but [ only ] his stomach , and [ from there it ] is eliminated ? ” ( By this , He declared all foods [ f ] ceremonially clean . )
AMP	Mark	7	20	And He said , “ Whatever comes from [ the heart of ] a man , that is what defiles and dishonors him .
AMP	Mark	7	21	For from within , [ that is ] out the heart of men , come base and malevolent thoughts and schemes , acts of sexual immorality , thefts , murders , adulteries ,
AMP	Mark	7	22	acts of greed and covetousness , wickedness , deceit , unrestrained conduct , envy and jealousy , slander and profanity , arrogance and self-righteousness and foolishness ( poor judgment ) .
AMP	Mark	7	23	All these evil things [ schemes and desires ] come from within and defile and dishonor the man. ” The Syrophoenician Woman
AMP	Mark	7	24	Jesus got up and left there and went to the region of Tyre [ and Sidon , the coastal area of Phoenicia ] . He entered a house and did not want anyone to know about it ; but it was impossible for Him to be hidden [ from the public ] . ( C )
AMP	Mark	7	25	Instead , after hearing about Him , a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately came and fell at His feet .
AMP	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a Gentile ( Greek ) , a [ g ] Syrophoenician by nationality . And she kept pleading with Him to drive the demon out of her daughter .
AMP	Mark	7	27	He was saying to her , “ First let the children [ of Israel ] be fed , for it is not right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the [ h ] pet dogs ( non-Jews ) . ”
AMP	Mark	7	28	confirms that on some level she understood this . - Mark 7:34 A command directed to the whole person . Copyright ©
AMP	Mark	7	29	And He said to her , “ Because of this answer [ reflecting your humility and faith ] , go [ knowing that your request is granted ] ; the demon has left your daughter [ permanently ] . ”
AMP	Mark	7	30	And returning to her home , she found the child lying on the couch [ relaxed and resting ] , the demon having gone .
AMP	Mark	7	31	Soon after this Jesus left the region of Tyre , and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , through the region of Decapolis [ the ten Hellenistic cities ] .
AMP	Mark	7	32	They brought to Him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking , and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him .
AMP	Mark	7	33	Jesus , taking him aside by himself , away from the crowd , put His fingers into the man ’ s ears , and after spitting , He touched the man ’ s tongue [ with the saliva ] ;
AMP	Mark	7	34	and looking up to heaven , He sighed deeply and said to the man , “ Ephphatha , ” which [ in Aramaic ] means , “ [ i ] Be opened and released ! ”
AMP	Mark	7	35	And his ears were opened , his tongue was released , and he began speaking plainly .
AMP	Mark	7	36	Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone ; but the more He ordered them , the more widely they continued to proclaim it .
AMP	Mark	7	37	They were thoroughly astounded and completely overwhelmed , saying , “ He has done everything well ! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak ! ” Footnotes - Mark 7:3 Mark explains Jewish customs and translates Hebrew terms for his Gentile readers . - Mark 7:3 Lit with the fist .

AMP	Mark	8	3	If I send them away to their homes hungry , they will faint [ from exhaustion ] on the road ; because some of them have come a long way. ”
AMP	Mark	8	4	His disciples replied to Him , “ Where will anyone be able to find enough bread here in this isolated place to feed these people ? ”
AMP	Mark	8	5	He asked them , “ How many loaves [ of bread ] do you have ? ” They said , “ Seven. ”
AMP	Mark	8	6	He directed the people to sit down on the ground ; and taking the seven loaves , He gave thanks and broke them , and [ repeatedly ] gave them to His disciples to set before them , and they served the crowd .

AMP	Mark	8	15	Jesus repeatedly ordered them , saying , “ Watch out ! Beware of the [ c ] leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. ”
AMP	Mark	8	16	They began discussing this with one another , saying , “ It is because we have no bread [ that He said this ] . ”
AMP	Mark	8	17	Jesus , aware of this [ discussion ] , said to them , “ Why are you discussing [ the fact ] that you have no bread ? Do you still not see or understand ? Are your hearts hardened ? ( B )
AMP	Mark	8	18	Though you have eyes , do you not see ? And though you have ears , do you not hear and listen [ to what I have said ] ? And do you not remember , ( C )
AMP	Mark	8	19	when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up ? ” They answered , “ Twelve. ”
AMP	Mark	8	20	“ And [ when I broke ] the seven [ loaves ] for the four thousand , how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up ? ” And they answered , “ Seven. ”
AMP	Mark	8	21	And He was saying to them , “ Do you still not understand ? ”
AMP	Mark	8	22	Then they came to Bethsaida ; and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged Him to touch him .
AMP	Mark	8	23	Taking the blind man by the hand , He led him out of the village ; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him , He asked him , “ Do you see anything ? ”
AMP	Mark	8	24	And he looked up and said , “ I see people , but [ they look ] like trees , walking around. ”
AMP	Mark	8	25	Then again Jesus laid His hands on his eyes ; and the man stared intently and [ his sight ] was [ completely ] restored , and he began to see everything clearly .
AMP	Mark	8	26	And He sent him to his home , saying , “ Do not even enter the village. ” Peter ’ s Confession of Christ
AMP	Mark	8	27	Then Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of [ d ] Caesarea Philippi ; and on the way He asked His disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ” ( D )
AMP	Mark	8	28	They answered Him , “ John the Baptist ; and others say Elijah ; but others , one of the prophets. ”
AMP	Mark	8	29	And He asked them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter replied to Him , “ You [ in contrast to the others ] are the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) . ”
AMP	Mark	8	30	Then Jesus strictly warned them not to tell anyone about Him .
AMP	Mark	8	31	And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must [ of necessity ] suffer many things and be rejected [ as the Messiah ] by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes , and must be put to death , and after three days rise [ from death to life ] . ( E )
AMP	Mark	8	32	He was stating the matter plainly [ not holding anything back ] . Then Peter took Him aside and began to reprimand Him .
AMP	Mark	8	33	But turning around [ with His back to Peter ] and seeing His disciples , He rebuked Peter , saying , “ Get behind Me , Satan ; for your mind is not set on God ’ s will or His values and purposes , but on what pleases man. ”
AMP	Mark	8	34	Jesus called the crowd together with His disciples , and said to them , “ If anyone wishes to follow Me [ as My disciple ] , he must deny himself [ set aside selfish interests ] , and [ e ] take up his cross [ expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come ] and follow Me [ believing in Me , conforming to My example in living and , if need be , suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me ] .
AMP	Mark	8	35	For whoever wishes to save his life [ in this world ] will [ eventually ] lose it [ through death ] , but whoever loses his life [ in this world ] for My sake and the gospel ’ s will save it [ from the consequences of sin and separation from God ] . ( F )
AMP	Mark	8	36	For what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world [ with all its pleasures ] , and forfeit his soul ?
AMP	Mark	8	37	For what will a man give in exchange for his soul and eternal life [ in God ’ s kingdom ] ?
AMP	Mark	8	38	For whoever is ashamed [ here and now ] of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels. ” Footnotes - Mark 8:10 This may have been another name for Magadan or Magdala . - Mark 8:12 Lit if a sign will be given .

AMP	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus expressly ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen , until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
AMP	Mark	9	2	Six days later , Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John , and led them up on a high mountain by themselves . And He was transfigured ( changed in form ) before them [ and began to shine brightly with divine and regal glory ] ; ( A )
AMP	Mark	9	3	and His clothes became radiant and dazzling , intensely white , as no launderer on earth can whiten them .
AMP	Mark	9	4	Elijah appeared to them along with Moses , and they were having a conversation with Jesus .
AMP	Mark	9	5	Peter responded and said to Jesus , “ Rabbi ( Master ) , it is good for us to be here ; let us make three [ sacred ] tents—one for You , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
AMP	Mark	9	6	For he did not [ really ] know what to say because they were terrified [ and stunned by the miraculous sight ] .
AMP	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud formed , overshadowing them , and [ b ] a voice came out of the cloud , “ This is My beloved Son . Listen to Him and obey Him ! ”
AMP	Mark	9	8	Suddenly they looked around and no longer saw anyone with them , except Jesus alone .
AMP	Mark	9	10	. - Mark 9:33 Probably Peter ’ s home . - Mark 9:43 See note Matt 5:22 . - Mark 9:44 Vv
AMP	Mark	9	11	They asked Him , saying , “ Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first [ before the Messiah comes ] ? ” ( B )
AMP	Mark	9	12	He answered them , “ Elijah does come first and restores and reestablishes all things . And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things [ grief and physical distress ] and be treated with contempt [ utterly despised and rejected ] ? ( C )
AMP	Mark	9	13	But I say to you that Elijah has in fact come [ already ] , and they [ d ] did to him whatever they wished , just as it is written [ in Scripture ] of him. ” All Things Possible
AMP	Mark	9	14	When they came [ back ] to the [ other nine ] disciples , they saw a large crowd around them , and scribes questioning and arguing with them . ( D )
AMP	Mark	9	15	Immediately , when the entire crowd saw Jesus , they were startled and began running up to greet Him .
AMP	Mark	9	16	He asked them , “ What are you discussing with them ? ”
AMP	Mark	9	17	One of the crowd replied to Him , “ Teacher , I brought You my son , possessed with a spirit which makes him unable to speak ;
AMP	Mark	9	18	and whenever it seizes him [ intending to do harm ] , it throws him down , and he foams [ at the mouth ] , and grinds his teeth and becomes stiff . I told Your disciples to drive it out , and they could not do it. ”
AMP	Mark	9	19	He replied , “ O unbelieving ( faithless ) generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I put up with you ? Bring him to Me ! ”
AMP	Mark	9	20	They brought the boy to Him . When the [ demonic ] spirit saw Him , immediately it threw the boy into a convulsion , and falling to the ground he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth .
AMP	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” And he answered , “ Since childhood .
AMP	Mark	9	22	The demon has often thrown him both into fire and into water , intending to kill him . But if You can do anything , take pity on us and help us ! ”
AMP	Mark	9	23	Jesus said to him , “ [ You say to Me , ] ‘ If You can ? ’ All things are possible for the one who believes and trusts [ in Me ] ! ”
AMP	Mark	9	24	Immediately the father of the boy cried out [ with a desperate , piercing cry ] , saying , “ I do believe ; help [ me overcome ] my unbelief. ”
AMP	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering [ around them ] , He rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ You deaf and mute spirit , I command you , come out of him and never enter him again ! ”
AMP	Mark	9	26	After screaming out and throwing him into a terrible convulsion , it came out . The boy looked so much like a corpse [ so still and pale ] that many [ of the spectators ] said , “ He is dead ! ”
AMP	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him ; and he stood up .
AMP	Mark	9	28	When He had gone indoors , His disciples began asking Him privately , “ Why were we unable to drive it out ? ”
AMP	Mark	9	29	He replied to them , “ This kind [ of unclean spirit ] can not come out by anything but prayer [ to the Father ] . ” Death and Resurrection Foretold
AMP	Mark	9	30	They went on from there and began to go through Galilee . Jesus did not want anyone to know it ,
AMP	Mark	9	31	because He was teaching His disciples [ and preparing them for the future ] . He told them , “ The Son of Man is to be betrayed and handed over to men [ who are His enemies ] , and they will kill Him ; and when He has been killed , He will rise [ from the dead ] three days later. ”
AMP	Mark	9	32	But [ e ] they did not understand this statement , and they were afraid to ask Him [ what He meant ] .
AMP	Mark	9	33	They arrived at Capernaum ; and when He was in the [ f ] house , He asked them , “ What were you discussing and arguing about on the road ? ” ( E )
AMP	Mark	9	34	But they kept quiet , because on the road they had discussed and debated with one another which one [ of them ] was the greatest .
AMP	Mark	9	35	Sitting down [ to teach ] , He called the twelve [ disciples ] and said to them , “ If anyone wants to be first , he must be last of all [ in importance ] and a servant of all. ”
AMP	Mark	9	36	Taking a child , He set him before them ; and taking him in His arms , He said to them ,
AMP	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever receives and welcomes one child such as this in My name receives Me ; and whoever receives Me receives not [ only ] Me , but Him who sent Me. ” ( F ) Dire Warnings
AMP	Mark	9	38	John said to Him , “ Teacher , we saw someone casting out demons in Your name , and we tried to stop him because he was not accompanying us [ as Your disciple ] . ” ( G )
AMP	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , “ Do not stop him ; for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name , and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me .
AMP	Mark	9	40	For he who is not against us is for us . ( H )
AMP	Mark	9	41	For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ , I assure you and most solemnly say to you , he will not lose his reward .
AMP	Mark	9	42	“ But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe and trust in Me to stumble [ that is , to sin or lose faith ] , it would be better for him if a heavy millstone [ one requiring a donkey ’ s strength to turn it ] were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea .

AMP	Mark	10	10	In the house the disciples began questioning Him again about this .
AMP	Mark	10	2	Pharisees came to Jesus to test Him [ intending to trick Him into saying something wrong ] , and asked Him , “ Is it lawful [ according to Scripture ] for a man to divorce his wife and send her away ? ”
AMP	Mark	10	3	He replied to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
AMP	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away. ” ( A )
AMP	Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them , “ Because of your hardness of hearts [ your callousness and insensitivity toward your wives and the [ a ] provision of God ] he wrote you this precept .
AMP	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of creation God made them male and female . ( B )
AMP	Mark	10	7	For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother [ to establish a home with his wife ] , ( C )
AMP	Mark	10	8	and the two shall become one flesh ; so that they are no longer two , but [ are united as ] one flesh . ( D )
AMP	Mark	10	9	Therefore , what God has united and joined together , man must not separate [ by divorce ] . ”
AMP	Mark	10	11	And He said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her ;
AMP	Mark	10	12	and if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man , she commits adultery. ” Jesus Blesses Little Children
AMP	Mark	10	13	People were bringing children to Him so that He would touch and bless them , but the disciples reprimanded them and discouraged them [ from coming ] .
AMP	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw this , He was indignant and He said to them , “ Allow the children to come to Me ; do not forbid them ; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
AMP	Mark	10	15	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , whoever does not receive and welcome the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all. ”
AMP	Mark	10	16	And He took the children [ one by one ] in His arms and [ b ] blessed them [ with kind , encouraging words ] , placing His hands on them . The Rich Young Ruler
AMP	Mark	10	17	As He was leaving on His journey , a man ran up and knelt before Him and asked Him , “ Good Teacher [ You who are essentially good and morally perfect ] , what shall I do to inherit eternal life [ that is , eternal salvation in the Messiah ’ s kingdom ] ? ” ( E )
AMP	Mark	10	18	Jesus said to him , “ [ c ] Why do you call Me good ? No one is [ essentially ] good [ by nature ] except God alone .
AMP	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not murder , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not testify falsely , Do not defraud , Honor your father and mother. ’ ” ( F )
AMP	Mark	10	20	And he replied to Him , “ Teacher , I have [ carefully ] kept all these [ commandments ] since my [ d ] youth. ”
AMP	Mark	10	21	Looking at him , Jesus felt a love ( high regard , compassion ) for him , and He said to him , “ You lack one thing : go and sell all your property and give [ the money ] to the poor , and you will have [ abundant ] treasure in heaven ; and come , follow Me [ becoming My disciple , believing and trusting in Me and walking the same path of life that I walk ] . ”
AMP	Mark	10	22	But the man was saddened at Jesus ’ words , and he left grieving , because he owned much property and had many possessions [ which he treasured more than his relationship with God ] .
AMP	Mark	10	23	Jesus looked around and said to His disciples , “ How difficult it will be for those who are wealthy [ and cling to possessions and status as security ] to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
AMP	Mark	10	24	The disciples were [ e ] amazed and bewildered by His words . But Jesus said to them again , “ Children , how difficult it is [ for those who place their hope and confidence in riches ] to enter the kingdom of God !
AMP	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man [ who places his faith in wealth or status ] to enter the kingdom of God. ”
AMP	Mark	10	26	They were completely and utterly astonished , and said to Him , “ Then who can be saved [ from the wrath of God ] ? ”
AMP	Mark	10	27	Looking at them , Jesus said , “ With people [ as far as it depends on them ] it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God. ”
AMP	Mark	10	28	Peter started saying to Him , “ Look , we have given up everything and followed You [ becoming Your disciples and accepting You as Teacher and Lord ] . ”
AMP	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , there is no one who has given up a house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms , for My sake and for the gospel ’ s sake ,
AMP	Mark	10	30	who will not receive a hundred times as much now in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms—along with persecutions ; and in the age to come , eternal life .
AMP	Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last , and the last , first. ” Jesus ’ Sufferings Foretold
AMP	Mark	10	32	Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was walking on ahead of them ; and they were perplexed [ at what Jesus had said ] , and those who were following were alarmed and afraid . And again He took the twelve [ disciples ] aside and began telling them what was going to happen to Him ,
AMP	Mark	10	33	saying , “ Listen very carefully : we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over to the chief priests and the scribes ; and they will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles ( Romans ) .
AMP	Mark	10	34	They will mock and ridicule Him and spit on Him , and whip ( scourge ) Him and kill Him , and three days later He will rise [ from the dead ] . ”
AMP	Mark	10	35	James and John , the two sons of Zebedee , came to Him , saying , “ Teacher , we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You. ” ( G )
AMP	Mark	10	36	And He replied to them , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ”
AMP	Mark	10	37	They said to Him , “ Grant that we may sit [ with You ] , one on Your right and one on Your left , in Your glory [ Your majesty and splendor in Your kingdom ] . ”
AMP	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Are you able to drink the cup that I drink , or to be baptized with the baptism [ of suffering and death ] with which I am baptized ? ”
AMP	Mark	10	39	And they replied to Him , “ We are able. ” Jesus told them , “ The cup that I drink you will drink , and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized .
AMP	Mark	10	40	But to sit on My right or left , this is not Mine to give ; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared [ by My Father ] . ”
AMP	Mark	10	41	Hearing this , the [ other ] ten became indignant with James and John .
AMP	Mark	10	42	Calling them to Himself , Jesus said to them , “ You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and their powerful men exercise authority over them [ tyrannizing them ] .
AMP	Mark	10	43	But this is not how it is among you ; instead , whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant ,
AMP	Mark	10	44	and whoever wishes to be first and most important among you must be slave of all .
AMP	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give His life as a [ f ] ransom for many. ” Bartimaeus Receives His Sight
AMP	Mark	10	46	Then they came to Jericho . And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd , a blind beggar , Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , was sitting beside the road [ as was his custom ] . ( H )
AMP	Mark	10	47	When Bartimaeus heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout and say , “ Jesus , [ g ] Son of David ( Messiah ) , have mercy on me ! ”
AMP	Mark	10	48	Many sternly rebuked him , telling him to keep still and be quiet ; but he kept on shouting out all the more , “ Son of David ( Messiah ) , have mercy on me ! ”
AMP	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him. ” So they called the blind man , telling him , “ Take courage , get up ! He is calling for you. ”
AMP	Mark	10	50	Throwing his cloak aside , he jumped up and came to Jesus .
AMP	Mark	10	51	And Jesus said , “ What do you want Me to do for you ? ” The blind man said to Him , “ Rabboni ( my Master ) , let me regain my sight. ”
AMP	Mark	10	52	Jesus said to him , “ Go ; your faith [ and confident trust in My power ] has made you well. ” Immediately he regained his sight and began following Jesus on the road .

AMP	Mark	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple [ enclosure ] ; and after looking around at everything , He left for Bethany with the twelve [ disciples ] , because it was already late [ in the day ] .
AMP	Mark	11	2	saying to them , “ Go into the [ a ] village in front of you , and immediately as you enter it , you will find a [ donkey ’ s ] [ b ] colt tied , which has never been ridden by anyone ; untie it and bring it here .
AMP	Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say , ‘ The Lord needs it ’ ; and immediately he will send it here. ”
AMP	Mark	11	4	So they went away [ to the village ] and found a colt tied outside at a gate in the street , and they untied it .
AMP	Mark	11	5	Some of the people who were standing there said to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
AMP	Mark	11	6	They replied to them just as Jesus had directed , and they allowed them to go .
AMP	Mark	11	7	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it , and He sat on it .
AMP	Mark	11	8	And many [ of the people ] spread their coats on the road [ as an act of tribute and homage before a new king ] , and others [ scattered a layer of ] leafy branches which they had cut from the fields [ honoring Him as Messiah ] . ( B )
AMP	Mark	11	9	Those who went in front and those who were following [ Him ] were shouting [ in joy and praise ] , “ Hosanna ( [ c ] Save , I pray ) ! Blessed ( praised , glorified ) is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ( C )
AMP	Mark	11	10	“ Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David ! Hosanna in the highest [ heaven ] ! ”
AMP	Mark	11	12	On the next day , when they had left Bethany , He was hungry . ( D )
AMP	Mark	11	13	Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf , He went to see if He would find anything on it . But He found nothing but leaves , for it was not the season for figs .
AMP	Mark	11	14	He said to it , “ No one will ever eat fruit from you again ! ” And His disciples were listening [ to what He said ] . Jesus Drives Moneychangers from the Temple
AMP	Mark	11	15	Then they came to Jerusalem . And He entered the temple [ grounds ] and began driving out [ with force ] the people who were [ d ] selling and buying [ animals for sacrifice ] in the temple area , and overturned the tables of the moneychangers [ who made a profit exchanging foreign money for temple coinage ] and the seats of those who were selling doves ; ( E )
AMP	Mark	11	16	and He would not permit anyone to carry [ e ] merchandise or household wares through the temple [ grounds , using the temple area irreverently as a shortcut ] .
AMP	Mark	11	17	He began to teach and say to them , “ Is it not written , ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? But you have made it a robbers ’ den. ” ( F )
AMP	Mark	11	18	The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began searching for a way to destroy Him ; for they were afraid of Him , since the entire crowd was struck with astonishment at His teaching .
AMP	Mark	11	19	When evening came , Jesus and His disciples would leave the city .
AMP	Mark	11	20	In the morning , as they were passing by , the disciples saw that the fig tree had withered away from the roots up .
AMP	Mark	11	21	And remembering , Peter said to Him , “ Rabbi ( Master ) , look ! The fig tree which You cursed has withered ! ”
AMP	Mark	11	22	Jesus replied , “ Have faith in God [ constantly ] .
AMP	Mark	11	23	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea ! ’ and [ f ] does not doubt in his heart [ in God ’ s unlimited power ] , but believes that what he says is going to take place , it will be done for him [ in accordance with God ’ s will ] .

AMP	Mark	11	24	For this reason I am telling you , whatever things you ask for in prayer [ in accordance with God ’ s will ] , believe [ with confident trust ] that you have received them , and they will be given to you .
AMP	Mark	11	25	Whenever you [ g ] stand praying , if you have anything against anyone , forgive him [ drop the issue , let it go ] , so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions and wrongdoings [ against Him and others ] .

AMP	Mark	11	27	They came again to Jerusalem . And as Jesus was walking in the [ courts and porches of the ] temple , the [ i ] chief priests , the scribes , and the elders came to Him , ( H )
AMP	Mark	11	28	and began saying to Him , “ By what authority are You doing these things , or who gave You this authority to do these things ? ”
AMP	Mark	11	29	Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question , and you answer Me , and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
AMP	Mark	11	30	Was the baptism of John [ the Baptist ] from heaven [ that is , ordained by God ] or from men ? Answer Me. ”
AMP	Mark	11	31	They began discussing it with each other , saying , “ If we say , ‘ From heaven , ’ He will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
AMP	Mark	11	32	But [ j ] shall we say , ‘ From men ? ’ ” —they were afraid [ to answer because ] of the crowd , for everyone considered John to have been a real prophet .
AMP	Mark	11	33	So they replied to Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:2 Probably Bethphage . - Mark 11:2 A colt that had not been used was considered holy by the Jews and was fit to carry a king . - Mark 11:9 Or Save now . - Mark 11:15 These vendors could charge pilgrims inflated prices for animals designated for sacrifice because OT law forbade the use of animals with blemishes or defects ( Deut 17:1 etc . ) , and the religious leaders had dictated even more stringent requirements .

Carrying merchandise through the temple showed even greater disrespect . - Mark 11:23 Jesus used this moment to emphasize to the disciples that a person ’ s confident , abiding faith combined with God ’ s power can produce absolutely amazing results , if the request is in harmony with God ’ s will . God is fully capable of doing that which man regards as impossible ( cf 14:36 ; James 4:3 ) . - Mark 11:25 Standing was a common posture for prayer among the Jews ( see Matt 6:5 ) . - Mark 11:26 Early mss do not contain this verse . - Mark 11:27 These three groups composed the Sanhedrin , the Jewish High Court . - Mark 11:32 Or if we say .

AMP	Mark	12	12	And they were looking for a way to seize Him , but they were afraid of the crowd ; for they knew that He spoke this parable in reference to [ and as a charge against ] them . And so they left Him and went away . Jesus Answers the Pharisees , Sadducees and Scribes
AMP	Mark	12	2	When the harvest season came he sent a [ b ] servant to the tenants , in order to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard .
AMP	Mark	12	3	They took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
AMP	Mark	12	4	Again he sent them another servant , and they [ threw stones and ] wounded him in the head , and treated him disgracefully .
AMP	Mark	12	5	And he sent another , and that one they killed ; then many others—some they beat and some they killed .
AMP	Mark	12	6	He still had one man left to send , a beloved son ; he sent him last of all to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
AMP	Mark	12	7	But those tenants said to each other , ‘ This man is the heir ! Come on , let us kill him [ and destroy the evidence ] , and his inheritance will be ours ! ’
AMP	Mark	12	8	So they took him and killed him , and threw his body outside the vineyard .
AMP	Mark	12	9	What will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the tenants , and will give the vineyard to others .
AMP	Mark	12	10	Have you not even read this Scripture : ‘ The stone which the builders regarded as unworthy and rejected , This [ very stone ] has become the chief Cornerstone
AMP	Mark	12	11	This came about from the Lord , And it is marvelous and wonderful in our eyes ’ ? ” ( B )
AMP	Mark	12	13	Then they sent some of the [ c ] Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus in order to trap Him into making a statement [ that they could use against Him ] . ( C )
AMP	Mark	12	14	They came and said to Him , “ Teacher , we know that You are truthful and have no personal bias toward anyone ; for You are not influenced by outward appearances or social status , but in truth You teach the way of God . Is it lawful [ according to Jewish law and tradition ] to pay the [ d ] poll-tax to [ [ e ] Tiberius ] Caesar , or not ?
AMP	Mark	12	15	Should we pay [ the tax ] or should we not pay ? ” But knowing their hypocrisy , He asked them , “ Why are you testing Me ? Bring Me a [ f ] coin ( denarius ) to look at. ”
AMP	Mark	12	16	So they brought one . Then He asked them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” They said to Him , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
AMP	Mark	12	17	Jesus said to them , “ Pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ” And they were greatly amazed at Him .
AMP	Mark	12	18	Some Sadducees ( who say that there is no resurrection ) came to Him , and began questioning Him , saying , ( D )
AMP	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , Moses wrote for us [ a law ] that if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but leaves no child , his brother is to [ g ] marry the widow and raise up children for his brother . ( E )
AMP	Mark	12	20	There were seven brothers ; the first [ one ] took a wife , and died leaving no children .
AMP	Mark	12	21	The second brother married her , and died leaving no children ; and the third likewise ;
AMP	Mark	12	22	and so all seven [ married her and died , and ] left no children . Last of all the woman died also .
AMP	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection , whose wife will she be ? For all seven [ brothers ] were married to her. ”
AMP	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Is this not why you are wrong , because you know neither the Scriptures [ that teach the resurrection ] nor the power of God [ who is able to raise the dead ] ?
AMP	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from the dead , they do not marry nor are they given in marriage , but are like angels in heaven .
AMP	Mark	12	26	But concerning the raising of the dead , have you not read in the book of Moses , in the passage about the burning bush , how God spoke to him , saying , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? ( F )
AMP	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living ; you are greatly mistaken and you are deceiving yourselves ! ”
AMP	Mark	12	28	Then one of the scribes [ an expert in Mosaic Law ] came up and listened to them arguing [ with one another ] , and noticing that Jesus answered them well , asked Him , “ Which commandment is first and most important of all ? ” ( G )
AMP	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The first and most important one is : ‘ Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God is one Lord ;
AMP	Mark	12	30	and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul ( life ) , and with all your mind ( thought , understanding ) , and with all your strength. ’ ( H )
AMP	Mark	12	31	This is the second : ‘ You shall [ unselfishly ] [ h ] love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than these. ” ( I )
AMP	Mark	12	32	) , and eventually to use that admission against Him when He claimed to be the Son of God and therefore God Himself . In reality , Jesus had admitted nothing that posed a problem for the concept of one God existing as three distinct Persons , and He drew attention to this fact by raising the issue of David ’ s relationship to the Messiah . - Mark 12:37 Lit his . - Mark 12:39 These seats were located near the scrolls of the Law , facing the congregation in the synagogue . - Mark 12:41 Thirteen trumpet-shaped chests were placed around the wall in the Court of Women in the temple . - Mark 12:41 The thirteen receptacles for the money were metal and the heavy silver coins contributed by the wealthy would have made quite a noise when they were deposited , calling audible attention to the size of each contribution . By contrast , the widow ’ s coins ( v
AMP	Mark	12	33	and to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength , and to [ unselfishly ] love one ’ s neighbor as oneself , is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. ” ( J )
AMP	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that he answered thoughtfully and intelligently , He said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ” And after that , no one would dare to ask Him any more questions .
AMP	Mark	12	35	Jesus began to say , as He taught in [ a portico or court of ] the temple , “ [ i ] How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David ? ( K )
AMP	Mark	12	36	David himself said [ when inspired ] by the Holy Spirit , ‘ The Lord ( the Father ) said to my Lord ( the Son , the Messiah ) , “ Sit at My right hand , Until I put Your enemies under Your feet. ” ’ ( L )
AMP	Mark	12	37	David himself calls Him ( the Son , the Messiah ) ‘ Lord ’ ; so how can it be that He is [ j ] David ’ s Son ? ” The large crowd enjoyed hearing Jesus and listened to Him with delight .
AMP	Mark	12	38	In [ the course of ] His teaching He was saying , “ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes [ displaying their prominence ] , and like to receive respectful greetings in the market places ,
AMP	Mark	12	39	and [ they love ] the [ k ] chief seats in the synagogues and the places of distinction and honor at banquets ,
AMP	Mark	12	40	[ these scribes ] who devour ( confiscate ) widows ’ houses , and offer long prayers for appearance ’ s sake [ to impress others ] . These men will receive greater condemnation. ” The Widow ’ s Mite

AMP	Mark	12	43	Calling His disciples to Him , He said to them , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , this poor widow put in [ proportionally ] more than all the contributors to the treasury .
AMP	Mark	12	44	For they all contributed from their surplus , but she , from her poverty , put in all she had , all she had to live on. ” Footnotes - Mark 12:1 It was commonplace to pile up loose rocks to serve as a low wall around one ’ s property . - Mark 12:2 The servants represent the prophets sent to Israel by God . - Mark 12:13 This was an unlikely alliance since the Pharisees were a strict religious sect while the Herodians were not religious and supported the rule of Caesar . - Mark 12:14 Every Jew was required to pay the poll-tax . It was considered a sign of subservience to Rome . - Mark 12:14 See note Matt 22:21 . - Mark 12:15 A day ’ s wages for a laborer . - Mark 12:19 The purpose of this was to carry on the family line and keep property within the family . - Mark 12:31 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love ( the Greek word agape ) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person , that is , having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another . - Mark 12:35 It is no coincidence that Jesus raises this question after His preceding discussion with the lawyer/scribe . Matthew ( 22:35 ) notes that the lawyer had questioned Jesus to test Him . His goal was to extract from Jesus the admission that there is only one God ( see v

AMP	Mark	13	2	Jesus replied to him , “ You see these great buildings ? Not one stone will be left on another which will not be [ b ] torn down ! ”
AMP	Mark	13	3	As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately ,
AMP	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will these things happen , and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled ? ”
AMP	Mark	13	5	Jesus began to say to them , “ Be careful and see to it that no one misleads you .
AMP	Mark	13	6	Many will come in My name [ misusing My name or claiming to be the Messiah ] , saying , ‘ I am He ! ’ and will deceive and mislead many .
AMP	Mark	13	7	When you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed ( frightened , troubled ) ; these things must take place , but the end is not yet .
AMP	Mark	13	8	For nation will rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; there will be earthquakes in various places ; there will be famines . These things are the beginning of the [ c ] birth pangs [ the intolerable anguish and suffering ] .

AMP	Mark	13	10	The gospel [ that is , the good news regarding the way of salvation ] must first be preached to all the [ Gentile ] nations . ( B )
AMP	Mark	13	11	When they take you and turn you over [ to the court ] , do not worry beforehand about what to say , but say whatever is given to you [ by God ] in that hour ; for it is not you who speak , but it is the Holy Spirit [ who will speak through you ] .
AMP	Mark	13	12	Brother will betray brother to [ be put to ] death , and a father [ will hand over ] his child ; and children will rise up and take a stand against parents and have them put to death .
AMP	Mark	13	14	“ But when you see the [ d ] abomination of desolation standing [ in the temple sanctuary ] where it ought not to be ( let the [ e ] reader understand ) then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains . ( C )
AMP	Mark	13	15	Whoever is on the housetop must not go down [ to enter the house ] , or go inside to take anything out of his house ;
AMP	Mark	13	16	whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his coat .
AMP	Mark	13	17	And woe to those women who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days !
AMP	Mark	13	18	Pray that it will not occur in winter ,

AMP	Mark	13	21	Then if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) ! ’ or , ‘ Look , He is there ! ’ do not believe it ;
AMP	Mark	13	22	for false Christs and false prophets will arise , and they will provide signs and wonders in order to deceive , if [ such a thing were ] possible , even the elect [ those God has chosen for Himself ] .

AMP	Mark	13	26	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory [ in royal majesty and splendor ] . ( G )
AMP	Mark	13	27	And then He will send out the angels , and will gather together His elect [ those He has chosen for Himself ] from the four winds , from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven .

AMP	Mark	13	30	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , this generation [ the people living when these signs and events begin ] will not pass away until all these things take place .

AMP	Mark	13	32	But of that [ exact ] day or hour no one knows , not even the angels in heaven , nor the Son [ in His humanity ] , but the Father alone .
AMP	Mark	13	33	“ Be on guard and stay constantly alert [ g ] [ and pray ] ; for you do not know when the appointed time will come .
AMP	Mark	13	34	It is like a man away on a journey , who when he left home put his servants in charge , each with his particular task , and also ordered the doorkeeper to be continually alert .
AMP	Mark	13	35	Therefore , be continually on the alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming , whether in the evening , or at midnight , or when the rooster crows , or in the morning—

The refurbishing of the temple was begun by Herod the Great in
AMP	Mark	13	64	by Herod Agrippa II . The rabbis had a saying : “ Whoever has not seen the temple of Herod has never seen a beautiful building ” ( as quoted from the Talmud ) . They also said that Herod built it of yellow , white , and perhaps blue marble ; and that he intended to cover it with gold , but the rabbis advised him not to because it was beautiful just as it was , looking like the waves of the sea . - Mark 13:2 In a.d.

AMP	Mark	14	2	but they were saying , “ Not during the festival , for the people might riot. ”
AMP	Mark	14	3	While He was in Bethany [ as a guest ] at the home of [ a ] Simon the leper , and reclining at the table , a [ b ] woman came with an alabaster vial of very costly and precious perfume of pure [ c ] nard ; and she broke the vial and poured the perfume over His head .
AMP	Mark	14	4	But there were [ d ] some who were indignantly remarking to one another , “ Why has this perfume been wasted ?
AMP	Mark	14	5	For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii [ a laborer ’ s wages for almost a year ] , and the money given to the poor. ” And they scolded her .
AMP	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , “ Let her alone ; why are you bothering her and causing trouble ? She has done a good and beautiful thing to Me .
AMP	Mark	14	7	For you always have the poor with you , and whenever you wish you can do something good to them ; but you will not always have Me . ( B )
AMP	Mark	14	8	She has done what she could ; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial .
AMP	Mark	14	9	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , wherever the good news [ regarding salvation ] is proclaimed throughout the world , what she has done will be told in memory of her. ”
AMP	Mark	14	10	Then Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve [ disciples ] , went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them . ( C )
AMP	Mark	14	11	When they heard this they were delighted , and promised to give him money . And he began looking for an opportune time to betray Jesus . The Last Passover
AMP	Mark	14	12	On the first day [ of the festival ] of [ e ] Unleavened Bread , when [ as was customary ] they sacrificed the Passover lamb , His disciples asked Him , “ Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover ? ” ( D )
AMP	Mark	14	13	And He sent two of His disciples , saying to them , “ Go into the city , and a [ f ] man carrying a jar of water will meet you ; follow him ;
AMP	Mark	14	15	He will show you a large upstairs room , furnished and ready [ with carpets and dining couches ] ; prepare [ the supper ] for us there. ”
AMP	Mark	14	16	The disciples left and went to the city and found everything just as He had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
AMP	Mark	14	17	When it was evening , He came with the twelve [ disciples ] . ( E )
AMP	Mark	14	18	While they were reclining at the table , Jesus said , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you that one of you will betray Me—one who is eating with Me. ” ( F )
AMP	Mark	14	19	They began to be grieved and deeply distressed and to say to Him one by one , “ Surely not I ? ”
AMP	Mark	14	20	And He replied , “ It is one of the twelve [ disciples ] , one who is dipping bread in the bowl with Me .
AMP	Mark	14	21	For the Son of Man goes [ to the cross ] just as it is written [ in Scripture ] of Him ; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born. ” The Lord ’ s Supper
AMP	Mark	14	22	While they were eating , Jesus took bread and [ h ] blessed it [ giving thanks and praise ] , and He broke it , and gave it to them and said , “ Take it . This is My body. ” ( G )
AMP	Mark	14	23	And when He had taken a cup [ of wine ] and [ i ] given thanks , He gave it to them , and they all drank from it . ( H )
AMP	Mark	14	24	And He said to them , “ This is My blood of the [ new ] covenant , [ My blood ] which is being poured out for many [ for the forgiveness of sins ] .
AMP	Mark	14	25	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. ”
AMP	Mark	14	26	After they had sung a [ j ] hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
AMP	Mark	14	27	Jesus said to them , “ You will all fall away [ and be ashamed and be afraid to be associated with Me as disciples ] , because it is written , ‘ I will strike the Shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered. ’ ( I )
AMP	Mark	14	28	But after I have been raised [ from the dead ] , I will go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
AMP	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to Him , “ Even if they all fall away [ and desert You , ashamed and afraid of being associated with You ] , yet I will not [ do so ] ! ”
AMP	Mark	14	30	Jesus said to him , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , this very night , before a rooster crows twice , you will deny [ that you even know ] Me three times. ” ( J )
AMP	Mark	14	31	But Peter kept saying insistently , “ If I have to die with You , I will not deny You ! ” And they all were saying the same thing as well . Jesus in Gethsemane
AMP	Mark	14	32	Then they went to a place called Gethsemane ; and Jesus said to His disciples , “ Sit down here until I have prayed. ” ( K )
AMP	Mark	14	33	He took Peter and James and John with Him , and He began to be deeply distressed and troubled [ extremely anguished at the prospect of what was to come ] .
AMP	Mark	14	34	And He said to them , “ My soul is deeply grieved and overwhelmed with sorrow , to the point of death ; remain here and keep watch. ”
AMP	Mark	14	35	After going a little farther , He fell to the ground [ distressed by the weight of His spiritual burden ] and began to pray that if it were possible [ in the Father ’ s will ] , the hour [ of suffering and death for the sins of mankind ] might pass from Him .
AMP	Mark	14	36	He was saying , “ [ k ] Abba , Father ! All things are possible for You ; take this cup [ of judgment ] away from Me ; but not what I will , but what You will. ”
AMP	Mark	14	37	And He came back and found them sleeping , and He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Were you unable to keep watch for one hour ?
AMP	Mark	14	38	Keep [ actively ] watching and praying so that you do not come into temptation ; the spirit is willing , but the [ l ] body is weak. ”
AMP	Mark	14	39	He went away again and prayed , saying the same words .
AMP	Mark	14	40	And again He came back and found them sleeping , because their eyes were very heavy ; and they did not know how to answer Him .
AMP	Mark	14	41	He came back a third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Enough [ of that ] ! The hour has come . Look , the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
AMP	Mark	14	42	Get up , let us go . Look , my betrayer is near ! ” Betrayal and Arrest
AMP	Mark	14	43	And at once , while He was still speaking , Judas [ Iscariot ] , one of the twelve [ disciples ] , came up , and with him a crowd of men with swords and clubs , who came from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders [ of the Sanhedrin ] . ( L )
AMP	Mark	14	44	Now the betrayer had given them a signal , saying , “ Whomever I kiss , He is the one ; seize Him and lead Him away safely [ under guard ] . ”
AMP	Mark	14	45	When Judas came , immediately he went up to Jesus and said , “ Rabbi ( Master ) ! ” and he [ m ] kissed Him [ forcefully ] .
AMP	Mark	14	46	They laid hands on Him and seized Him .
AMP	Mark	14	47	But one of the bystanders [ Simon Peter ] drew his sword and struck [ Malchus ] the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear . ( M )
AMP	Mark	14	48	Jesus said to them , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me , as you would against a robber ?
AMP	Mark	14	49	Day after day I was with you , teaching in the [ courts and porches of the ] temple , and you did not seize Me ; but this has happened so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled. ”
AMP	Mark	14	50	Then all of His disciples abandoned Him and fled .
AMP	Mark	14	51	A young [ n ] man was following Him , wearing [ only ] a linen sheet over his naked body ; and some men seized him .
AMP	Mark	14	52	But pulling free of the linen sheet , he escaped [ from them ] naked . Jesus before His Accusers
AMP	Mark	14	53	They led Jesus away to the high priest , and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes ( Sanhedrin , Jewish High Court ) gathered together . ( N )
AMP	Mark	14	54	Peter had followed Him at a distance , right into the courtyard of the high priest ; and he was sitting with the officers [ guards and servants ] and warming himself at the fire .
AMP	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the entire Council ( Sanhedrin , Jewish High Court ) were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus [ which they could use ] to have Him [ condemned and ] executed , but they were not finding any .
AMP	Mark	14	56	For many [ people ] were giving false testimony against Him , but their testimonies were not consistent .
AMP	Mark	14	57	Some stood up and began to give false testimony against Him , saying ,
AMP	Mark	14	58	“ We heard Him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple ( sanctuary ) that was made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands. ’ ” ( O )
AMP	Mark	14	59	Not even in this respect was their testimony consistent .
AMP	Mark	14	60	The high priest stood up and came forward and asked Jesus , “ Have You no answer to give [ in response ] to what these men are testifying against You ? ”
AMP	Mark	14	61	But Jesus kept silent and gave no answer at all . Again the high priest was questioning Him , and saying to Him , “ Are You the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , the Son of the [ o ] Blessed One ? ”
AMP	Mark	14	62	Jesus said , “ I am ; and you will [ all ] see the Son of Man seated [ with authority ] at the right hand of Power ( the Father ) , and coming with the clouds of heaven. ” ( P )
AMP	Mark	14	63	Then [ p ] tearing his robe [ to express his indignation ] , the high priest said , “ What further need do we have of witnesses ? ( Q )
AMP	Mark	14	64	You have heard the blasphemy [ that is , His claim to be the Son of God ] . What is your decision ? ” And they all condemned Him to be [ guilty and ] deserving of death . ( R )
AMP	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on Him , and to blindfold Him , and to beat Him with their fists , and to say to Him , “ Prophesy [ by telling us who hit you ] ! ” Then the officers took custody of Him and struck him in the face . Peter ’ s Denials
AMP	Mark	14	66	While Peter was down below in the courtyard , one of the servant-girls of the high priest came , ( S )
AMP	Mark	14	67	and when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked intently at him and said , “ You were with Jesus the Nazarene , too. ”
AMP	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. ” Then he went out [ of the courtyard ] to the porch , [ q ] [ and a rooster crowed . ]
AMP	Mark	14	69	The servant-girl saw him , and began once more to tell the bystanders , “ This [ man ] is one of them. ”
AMP	Mark	14	70	But again he denied it . After a little while , the bystanders again said to Peter , “ You are in fact one of them , for [ it is clear from your accent , that ] you are a Galilean , too. ”
AMP	Mark	14	71	But he began to [ r ] invoke a curse [ on himself ] and to swear [ an oath ] , “ I do not know this man you are talking about ! ”
AMP	Mark	14	72	Immediately a rooster crowed the second time .

AMP	Luke	3	16	John answered them all by saying , “ As for me , I baptize you [ only ] [ h ] with water ; but One who is mightier [ more powerful , more noble ] than I is coming , and I am not fit to untie the strap of His sandals [ even as His slave ] .

AMP	Luke	4	15	And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised and glorified and honored by all .
AMP	Luke	4	16	So He came to Nazareth , where He had been brought up ; and as was His custom , He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath , and stood up to read .
AMP	Luke	4	17	The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him . He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written , ( G )
AMP	Luke	4	18	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me ( the Messiah ) , Because He has anointed Me to preach the good news to the poor .

AMP	Luke	4	19	to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord [ the day when salvation and the favor of God abound greatly ] . ” ( H )
AMP	Luke	4	20	Then He rolled up the scroll [ having stopped in the middle of the verse ] , gave it back to the attendant and sat down [ to teach ] ; and the eyes of all those in the synagogue were [ attentively ] fixed on Him .
AMP	Luke	4	21	He began speaking to them : “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing and in your presence. ”
AMP	Luke	4	22	And [ as He continued on ] they all were speaking well of Him , and were in awe and were wondering about the words of grace which were coming from His lips ; and they were saying , “ Is this not Joseph ’ s son ? ”
AMP	Luke	4	23	So He said to them , “ You will no doubt quote this proverb to Me , ‘ Physician , heal Yourself ! Whatever [ miracles ] that we heard were done [ by You ] in Capernaum , do here in Your hometown as well. ’ ”
AMP	Luke	4	24	Then He said , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , no prophet is welcome in his hometown .

AMP	Luke	4	26	and yet Elijah was not sent [ by the Lord ] to a single one of them , but only to Zarephath in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow . ( I )
AMP	Luke	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and not one of them was cleansed [ by being healed ] except Naaman the Syrian. ” ( J )
AMP	Luke	4	28	As they heard these things [ about God ’ s grace to these two Gentiles ] , the people in the synagogue were filled with a great rage ;
AMP	Luke	4	29	and they got up and drove Him out of the city , and led Him to the crest of the hill on which their city had been built , in order to hurl Him down the cliff .
AMP	Luke	4	30	But passing [ miraculously ] through the crowd , He went on His way .
AMP	Luke	4	31	Then He came down [ from the hills of Nazareth ] to Capernaum , a city of Galilee [ on the shore of the sea ] , and He was teaching them on the Sabbath ; ( K )
AMP	Luke	4	32	and they were surprised [ almost overwhelmed ] at His teaching , because His message was [ given ] with authority and power and great ability .
AMP	Luke	4	33	There was a man in the synagogue who was possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon ; and he cried out with a loud and terrible voice ,
AMP	Luke	4	34	“ Let us alone ! [ b ] What business do we have [ in common ] with each other , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have You come to destroy us ? I know who You are—the Holy One of God ! ”
AMP	Luke	4	35	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent ( muzzled , gagged ) and come out of him ! ” And when the demon had thrown the man down among them , he came out of him without injuring him in any way .
AMP	Luke	4	36	They were all astonished and in awe , and began saying to one another , “ What is this message ? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits and they come out ! ”
AMP	Luke	4	37	And the news about Him spread into every place in the surrounding district ( Galilee ) . Many Are Healed
AMP	Luke	4	38	Then Jesus got up and left the synagogue and went to Simon ’ s ( Peter ’ s ) house . Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever , and they asked Him to help her . ( L )
AMP	Luke	4	39	Standing over her , He rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and immediately she got up and began serving them [ as her guests ] .
AMP	Luke	4	40	While the sun was setting [ marking the end of the Sabbath day ] , all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus ; and laying His hands on each one of them , He was healing them [ exhibiting His authority as Messiah ] . ( M )
AMP	Luke	4	41	Demons also were coming out of many people , shouting , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak , because they knew that He was the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) .

AMP	Luke	5	20	When Jesus saw their [ active ] faith [ springing from confidence in Him ] , He said , “ Man , your sins are forgiven. ”
AMP	Luke	5	21	The scribes and the Pharisees began to consider and question [ the implications of what He had said ] , saying , “ Who is this man who speaks blasphemies [ by claiming the rights and prerogatives of God ] ? Who can forgive sins [ that is , remove guilt , nullify sin ’ s penalty , and assign righteousness ] except God alone ? ”
AMP	Luke	5	22	But Jesus , knowing their [ hostile ] thoughts , answered them , “ Why are you questioning [ these things ] in your hearts ?
AMP	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ’ ?
AMP	Luke	5	24	But , in order that you may know that the Son of Man ( the Messiah ) has authority and power on earth to forgive sins ” —He said to the paralyzed man , “ I say to you , get up , pick up your stretcher and go home. ”
AMP	Luke	5	25	He immediately stood up before them , picked up his stretcher , and went home glorifying and praising God .

AMP	Luke	8	4	When a large crowd was gathering together , and people from city after city were coming to Him , He spoke [ to them ] using a parable : ( A )
AMP	Luke	8	5	“ The sower went out to sow his seed ; and as he sowed , some fell beside the road and it was trampled underfoot , and the birds of the sky ate it up .
AMP	Luke	8	6	And some seed fell on [ shallow soil covering ] the rocks , and as soon as it sprouted , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
AMP	Luke	8	7	Other seed fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out .
AMP	Luke	8	9	Now His disciples began asking Him what this parable meant .
AMP	Luke	8	10	And He said , “ To you [ who have been chosen ] it has been granted to know and recognize the [ a ] mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest it is in parables , so that though seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . ( B )
AMP	Luke	8	11	“ Now [ the meaning of ] the parable is this : The seed is the word of God [ concerning eternal salvation ] .
AMP	Luke	8	12	Those beside the road are the people who have heard ; then the devil comes and takes the message [ of God ] away from their hearts , so that they will not believe [ in Me as the Messiah ] and be saved .
AMP	Luke	8	13	Those on the rocky soil are the people who , when they hear , receive and welcome the word with joy ; but these have no firmly grounded root . They believe for a while , and in time of trial and temptation they fall away [ from Me and abandon their faith ] .
AMP	Luke	8	14	The seed which fell among the thorns , these are the ones who have heard , but as they go on their way they are suffocated with the anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life , and they bring no fruit to maturity .
AMP	Luke	8	15	But as for that seed in the good soil , these are the ones who have heard the word with a good and noble heart , and hold on to it tightly , and bear fruit with patience . Parable of the Lamp
AMP	Luke	8	16	“ Now no one lights a lamp and then covers it with a container [ to hide it ] , or puts it under a bed ; instead , he puts it on a lampstand , so that those who come in may see the light . ( C )

I beg You , do not torment me [ before the appointed time of judgment ] ! ”
AMP	Luke	8	29	Now He was [ already ] commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For it had seized him [ violently ] many times ; and he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles , but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert .

AMP	Luke	8	33	Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs ; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned .
AMP	Luke	8	34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened , they ran away and told it in the city and out in the country .

AMP	Luke	8	43	And a woman who had [ suffered from ] a hemorrhage for twelve years [ e ] [ and had spent all her money on physicians ] , and could not be healed by anyone ,
AMP	Luke	8	44	came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His outer robe , and immediately her bleeding stopped .
AMP	Luke	8	45	Jesus said , “ Who touched Me ? ” While they all were denying it , Peter [ f ] [ and those who were with him ] said , “ Master , the people are crowding and pushing against You ! ”
AMP	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone did touch Me , because I was aware that power [ to heal ] had gone out of Me. ”
AMP	Luke	8	47	When the woman saw that she had not escaped notice , she came up trembling and fell down before Him . She declared in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched Him , and how she had been immediately healed .

AMP	Luke	9	8	and by others that Elijah had appeared , and by others that one of the [ other ] prophets of old had been resurrected .
AMP	Luke	9	10	When the apostles returned , they told Him all that they had done . He took them with Him and He privately withdrew [ across the Jordan ] to a city called Bethsaida . ( C )
AMP	Luke	9	11	But when the crowds learned of it , they followed Him ; and He welcomed them and He began talking to them about the kingdom of God , and healing those who needed to be healed . Five Thousand Fed
AMP	Luke	9	12	Now the day was ending , and the twelve [ disciples ] came and said to Him , “ Send the crowd away , so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging , and get provisions ; because here we are in an isolated place. ”
AMP	Luke	9	13	But He said to them , “ You give them something to eat. ” They said , “ We have no more than five loaves and two fish—unless perhaps we go and buy food for all these people. ” ( D )
AMP	Luke	9	14	( For there were [ c ] about 5,000 men . ) And He said to His disciples , “ Have them sit down to eat in groups of about fifty each. ”
AMP	Luke	9	15	They did so , and had them all sit down .
AMP	Luke	9	16	Then He took the five loaves and the two fish , and He looked up to heaven [ and gave thanks ] and blessed them , and broke them and kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd .
AMP	Luke	9	17	They all ate and were [ completely ] satisfied ; and the broken pieces which they had left over were [ abundant and were ] picked up—twelve baskets full .
AMP	Luke	9	18	Now it happened that as Jesus was praying privately , the disciples were with Him , and He asked them , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ” ( E )
AMP	Luke	9	19	They answered , “ John the Baptist , and some say , Elijah ; but others , that one of the ancient prophets has come back to life. ”
AMP	Luke	9	20	And He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter replied , “ The Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) of God ! ”
AMP	Luke	9	21	But He strictly warned and admonished them not to tell this to anyone ,
AMP	Luke	9	22	saying , “ The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected [ as the Messiah ] by the elders and chief priests and scribes ( Sanhedrin , Jewish High Court ) , and be put to death , and on the third day be raised up [ from death to life ] . ” ( F )
AMP	Luke	9	23	And He was saying to them all , “ If anyone wishes to follow Me [ as My disciple ] , he must deny himself [ set aside selfish interests ] , and take up his cross daily [ expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come ] and follow Me [ believing in Me , conforming to My example in living and , if need be , suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me ] .
AMP	Luke	9	24	For whoever wishes to save his life [ in this world ] will [ eventually ] lose it [ through death ] , but whoever loses his life [ in this world ] for My sake , he is the one who will save it [ from the consequences of sin and separation from God ] .
AMP	Luke	9	25	For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world [ wealth , fame , success ] , and loses or forfeits himself ?
AMP	Luke	9	26	For whoever is ashamed [ here and now ] of Me and My words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory and the glory of the [ heavenly ] Father and of the holy angels .
AMP	Luke	9	27	But I tell you truthfully , there are [ d ] some among those standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. ” The Transfiguration
AMP	Luke	9	28	Now about eight days after these teachings , He took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray . ( G )
AMP	Luke	9	29	As He was praying , the appearance of His face became different [ actually transformed ] , and His clothing became white and flashing with the brilliance of lightning .
AMP	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men were talking with Him ; and they were Moses and Elijah ,
AMP	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory , and were speaking of His departure [ from earthly life ] , which He was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem .
AMP	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and those who were with him had been overcome with sleep ; but when they were fully awake , they saw His glory and splendor and majesty , and the two men who were standing with Him .
AMP	Luke	9	33	And as these [ men , Moses and Elijah ] were leaving Him , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is delightful and good for us to be here ; we should make three [ sacred ] tents ; one for You , one for Moses , and one for Elijah ” —not realizing what he was saying .
AMP	Luke	9	34	But even as he was saying this , a cloud formed and began to overshadow them ; and they were [ greatly ] afraid as they entered the cloud .
AMP	Luke	9	35	Then [ e ] a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is My beloved Son , My Chosen One ; listen and obey and yield to Him ! ”
AMP	Luke	9	36	When the voice had ceased , Jesus was found there alone . And they kept silent , and told no one at that time any of the things which they had seen [ concerning the divine manifestation ] . ( H )
AMP	Luke	9	37	On the next day , when they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met Him . ( I )
AMP	Luke	9	38	And a man from the crowd shouted for help , “ Teacher , I beg You to look at my son , because he is my only child ;
AMP	Luke	9	39	and a spirit seizes him , and suddenly he cries out , and it throws him into a convulsion so that he foams at the mouth ; and only with [ great ] difficulty does it leave him , mauling and bruising him as it leaves .
AMP	Luke	9	40	I begged Your disciples to cast it out , but they could not. ”
AMP	Luke	9	41	Jesus answered , “ You unbelieving and perverted generation ! How long shall I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here [ to Me ] . ”
AMP	Luke	9	42	Even while the boy was coming , the demon slammed him down and threw him into a [ violent ] convulsion . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy and gave him back to his father .
AMP	Luke	9	43	They were all amazed [ practically overwhelmed ] at the [ evidence of the ] greatness of God and His majesty and His wondrous work . ( J ) But while they were still awed by everything Jesus was doing , He said to His disciples ,
AMP	Luke	9	44	“ Let these words sink into your ears : the Son of Man is going to be betrayed and handed over to men [ who are His enemies ] . ”
AMP	Luke	9	45	However , they did not understand this statement . Its meaning was kept hidden from them so that they would not grasp it ; and they were afraid to ask Him about it . The Test of Greatness
AMP	Luke	9	46	An argument started among them as to which of them might be the greatest [ surpassing the others in esteem and authority ] . ( K )
AMP	Luke	9	47	But Jesus , knowing what they were thinking in their heart , took a child and had him stand beside Him ,
AMP	Luke	9	48	and He told them , “ Whoever welcomes this child in My name welcomes Me ; and whoever welcomes Me [ also ] welcomes Him who sent Me ; for the one who is least among all of you [ that is , the one who is genuinely humble—the one with a realistic self-view ] —he is the one who is [ truly ] great. ”
AMP	Luke	9	49	John replied , “ Master , we saw someone driving out demons in Your name ; and we tried to stop him because he does not follow along with us. ” ( L )
AMP	Luke	9	50	But Jesus told him , “ Do not stop him ; for he who is not against you is for you. ” ( M )
AMP	Luke	9	51	Now when the time was approaching for Him to be taken up [ to heaven ] , He was determined to go to Jerusalem [ to fulfill His purpose ] .
AMP	Luke	9	52	He sent messengers on ahead of Him , and they went into a Samaritan village to make arrangements for Him ;
AMP	Luke	9	53	but the people would not welcome Him , [ f ] because He was traveling toward Jerusalem .
AMP	Luke	9	54	When His disciples James and John saw this , they said , “ Lord , do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them ? ” ( N )

AMP	Luke	10	13	“ Woe ( judgment is coming ) to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented and changed their minds long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes [ to show deep regret for sin ] .

AMP	Luke	10	17	The seventy returned with joy , saying , “ Lord , even the demons are subject to us in Your name. ”
AMP	Luke	10	18	He said to them , “ I watched Satan fall from heaven like [ a flash of ] lightning .
AMP	Luke	10	19	Listen carefully : I have given you authority [ that you now possess ] to tread on [ d ] serpents and scorpions , and [ the ability to exercise authority ] over all the power of the enemy ( Satan ) ; and nothing will [ in any way ] harm you .
AMP	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless do not rejoice at this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven. ” ( C )
AMP	Luke	10	21	In that very hour He was overjoyed and rejoiced greatly in the Holy Spirit , and He said , “ I praise You , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that You have hidden these things [ relating to salvation ] from the [ e ] wise and intelligent , and have revealed them to infants [ the childlike and untaught ] . Yes , Father , for this way was [ Your gracious will and choice , and was ] well-pleasing in Your sight .
AMP	Luke	10	22	All things have been transferred and turned over to Me by My Father and no one knows who the Son is except the Father , or who the Father is except the Son , and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him. ”
AMP	Luke	10	23	Then turning to His disciples , Jesus said privately , “ Blessed [ joyful , spiritually enlightened , and favored by God ] are the eyes which see what you see , ( D )
AMP	Luke	10	24	for I say to you that many prophets and kings longed to see what you see , and they did not see it ; and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it. ”
AMP	Luke	10	25	And a certain lawyer [ an expert in Mosaic Law ] stood up to test Him , saying , “ Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ” ( E )
AMP	Luke	10	26	Jesus said to him , “ What is written in the Law ? How do you read it ? ”
AMP	Luke	10	27	And he replied , “ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself. ” ( F )

AMP	Luke	10	29	But he , wishing to justify and vindicate himself , asked Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ” Parable of the Good Samaritan
AMP	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied , “ A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he encountered robbers , who stripped him of his clothes [ and belongings ] , beat him , and went their way [ unconcerned ] , leaving him half dead .
AMP	Luke	10	31	Now by coincidence a priest was going down that road , and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
AMP	Luke	10	32	Likewise a Levite also came down to the place and saw him , and passed by on the other side [ of the road ] .
AMP	Luke	10	33	But a Samaritan ( foreigner ) , who was traveling , came upon him ; and when he saw him , he was deeply moved with compassion [ for him ] ,
AMP	Luke	10	34	and went to him and bandaged up his wounds , pouring oil and wine on them [ to sooth and disinfect the injuries ] ; and he put him on his own pack-animal , and brought him to an inn and took care of him .
AMP	Luke	10	35	On the next day he took out two denarii ( two days ’ wages ) and gave them to the innkeeper , and said , ‘ Take care of him ; and whatever more you spend , I will repay you when I return. ’
AMP	Luke	10	36	Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to the man who encountered the robbers ? ”
AMP	Luke	10	37	He answered , “ The one who showed compassion and mercy to him. ” Then Jesus said to him , “ Go and constantly do the same. ” Martha and Mary
AMP	Luke	10	38	Now while they were on their way , Jesus entered a village [ called Bethany ] , and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home . ( H )
AMP	Luke	10	39	She had a sister named Mary , who seated herself at the Lord ’ s feet and was continually listening to His teaching .

AMP	Luke	11	14	And [ at another time ] Jesus was casting out a demon , and it was [ controlling a man so as to make him ] mute ; when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke . And the crowds were awed . ( B )
AMP	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ He drives out demons by [ the power of ] [ i ] Beelzebul ( Satan ) , the ruler of the demons. ”
AMP	Luke	11	16	Others , trying to test Him , were demanding of Him a sign from heaven .
AMP	Luke	11	17	But He , well aware of their thoughts and purpose , said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is doomed to destruction ; and a house divided against itself falls .
AMP	Luke	11	18	If Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand and continue to survive ? For you are saying that I drive out demons by [ the power of ] Beelzebul .
AMP	Luke	11	19	Now if I drive out the demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons [ the Jewish exorcists ] drive them out ? For this reason they will be your judges .

AMP	Luke	11	23	He who is not with Me [ believing in Me as Lord and Savior ] is against Me [ there is no impartial position ] ; and he who does not gather with Me [ assisting in My ministry ] , scatters .

AMP	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in [ the person ] and live there ; and the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. ”

AMP	Luke	11	28	But He said , “ On the contrary , blessed ( happy , favored by God ) are those who hear the word of God and continually observe it. ” The Sign of Jonah
AMP	Luke	11	29	Now as the crowds were increasing [ in number ] , He began to say , “ This [ present ] generation is a wicked generation ; it seeks a sign ( attesting miracle ) , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah [ the prophet ] . ( C )

AMP	Luke	11	37	Now after Jesus had spoken , a Pharisee asked Him to have lunch with him . He went in [ the Pharisee ’ s home ] and reclined at the table [ without ceremonially washing His hands ] .
AMP	Luke	11	38	The Pharisee noticed this and was surprised that Jesus did not first ceremonially wash before the meal .

AMP	Luke	11	43	Woe to you Pharisees , because you love the [ n ] best seats in the synagogues and to be respectfully greeted in the market places .

AMP	Luke	11	46	But He said , “ Woe to you lawyers as well , because you weigh men down with burdens [ man-made rules , unreasonable requirements ] which are hard to bear , and you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers [ to lighten the load ] .
AMP	Luke	11	47	Woe to you ! For you repair or build [ o ] tombs for the prophets , and it was your fathers who killed them .

AMP	Luke	12	9	But he who denies Me before men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God .
AMP	Luke	12	10	And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but he who [ d ] blasphemes against the Holy Spirit [ that is , whoever intentionally discredits the Holy Spirit by attributing the authenticating miracles done by Me to Satan ] , it will not be forgiven him [ for him there is no forgiveness ] . ( B )
AMP	Luke	12	11	When they bring you before the synagogues and the magistrates and the authorities , do not be worried about how you are to defend yourselves or what you are to say ;
AMP	Luke	12	13	Someone from the crowd said to Him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me. ”
AMP	Luke	12	14	But He said to him , “ Man , who appointed Me a judge or an arbitrator over [ the two of ] you ? ”
AMP	Luke	12	15	Then He said to them , “ Watch out and guard yourselves against every form of greed ; for not even when one has an overflowing abundance does his life consist of nor is it derived from his possessions. ” Parable of the Wealthy Fool
AMP	Luke	12	16	Then He told them a parable , saying , “ There was a rich man whose land was very fertile and productive .
AMP	Luke	12	17	And he began thinking to himself , ‘ What shall I do , since I have no place [ large enough in which ] to store my crops ? ’
AMP	Luke	12	18	Then he said , ‘ This is what I will do : I will tear down my storehouses and build larger ones , and I will store all my grain and my goods there .
AMP	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , “ Soul , you have many good things stored up , [ enough ] for many years ; rest and relax , eat , drink and be merry ( celebrate continually ) . ” ’
AMP	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! This very night your soul is required of you ; and now who will own all the things you have prepared ? ’ ( C )
AMP	Luke	12	21	So it is for the one who continues to store up and hoard possessions for himself , and is not rich [ in his relationship ] toward God. ”
AMP	Luke	12	22	Jesus said to His disciples , “ For this reason I tell you , do not worry about your life , as to what you will eat ; or about your body , as to what you will wear . ( D )
AMP	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothes .
AMP	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens , for they neither sow [ seed ] nor reap [ the crop ] ; they have no storehouse or barn , and yet God feeds them . How much more valuable are you than the birds !
AMP	Luke	12	25	And which of you by worrying can add one hour to his life ’ s span ?
AMP	Luke	12	26	So if you are not even able to do a very little thing [ such as that ] , why are you worried about the rest ?
AMP	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies and wildflowers , how they grow [ in the open field ] . They neither labor nor spin [ wool to make clothing ] ; yet I tell you , not even Solomon in all his glory and splendor dressed himself like one of these . ( E )
AMP	Luke	12	28	But if this is how God clothes the grass which is in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , how much more will He clothe you ? You of little faith !
AMP	Luke	12	29	So as for you , do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink ; nor have an anxious and unsettled mind .
AMP	Luke	12	30	For all the [ pagan ] nations of the world greedily seek these things ; and your [ heavenly ] Father [ already ] knows that you need them .
AMP	Luke	12	31	But [ strive for and actively ] seek His kingdom , and these things will be given to you as well .
AMP	Luke	12	32	Do not be afraid and anxious , little flock , for it is your Father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
AMP	Luke	12	33	“ Sell your possessions ( show compassion ) and give [ donations ] to the poor . Provide money belts for yourselves that do not wear out , an unfailing and inexhaustible treasure in the heavens , where no thief comes near and no moth destroys .
AMP	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . Be in Readiness
AMP	Luke	12	35	“ Be dressed and ready for active service , and keep your lamps continuously burning .
AMP	Luke	12	36	Be like men who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast , so that when he comes and knocks they may immediately open the door for him .
AMP	Luke	12	37	Blessed ( happy , prosperous , to be admired ) are those servants whom the master finds awake and watching when he arrives . I assure you and most solemnly say to you , he will prepare himself to serve , and will have them recline at the table , and will come and wait on them .
AMP	Luke	12	38	Whether he comes in the second watch ( before midnight ) , or even in the third ( after midnight ) , and finds them so [ prepared and ready ] , blessed are those servants .
AMP	Luke	12	39	“ But be sure of this , that if the head of the house had known at what time the thief was coming , he [ would have been awake and alert , and ] would not have allowed his house to be broken into . ( F )
AMP	Luke	12	40	You too , be continually ready ; because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not expect. ”
AMP	Luke	12	41	Peter said , “ Lord , are You addressing this parable to us [ disciples ] , or to everyone else as well ? ” Parable of the Faithful Steward
AMP	Luke	12	42	The Lord said , “ Who then is the faithful and wise steward [ of the estate ] , whom his master will put in charge over his household , to give his servants their portion of food at the proper time ? ( G )
AMP	Luke	12	43	Blessed ( happy , prosperous , to be admired ) is that servant whom his master finds so doing when he arrives .
AMP	Luke	12	44	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
AMP	Luke	12	45	But if that servant says in his heart , ‘ My master is taking his time in coming , ’ and begins to beat the servants , both men and women , and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
AMP	Luke	12	46	the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know , and will [ e ] cut him in pieces , and assign him a place with the unbelievers .
AMP	Luke	12	47	And that servant who knew his master ’ s will , and yet did not get ready or act in accord with his will , will be beaten with many lashes [ of the whip ] ,
AMP	Luke	12	48	but the one who did not know it and did things worthy of a beating , will receive only a few [ lashes ] . From everyone to whom much has been given , much will be required ; and to whom they entrusted much , of him they will ask all the more . ( H ) Christ Divides Men
AMP	Luke	12	49	“ I have come to cast fire ( judgment ) on the earth ; and how I wish that it were already kindled !
AMP	Luke	12	50	I have a baptism [ of great suffering ] with which to be baptized , and how [ greatly ] I am distressed until it is accomplished !
AMP	Luke	12	51	Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division [ between believers and unbelievers ] ; ( I )
AMP	Luke	12	52	for from now on five in one household will be divided [ over Me ] , three against two and two against three .
AMP	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” ( J )
AMP	Luke	12	54	He also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising in the west , you immediately say , ‘ It is going to rain , ’ and that is how it turns out .
AMP	Luke	12	55	And when [ you see that ] a south wind is blowing , you say , ‘ It will be a hot day , ’ and it happens .
AMP	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites ( play-actors , pretenders ) ! You know how to analyze and intelligently interpret the appearance of the earth and sky [ to forecast the weather ] , but why do you not intelligently interpret this present time ?
AMP	Luke	12	57	“ And why do you not even on your own initiative judge what is right ?
AMP	Luke	12	58	For while you are going with your opponent [ at law ] to appear before a magistrate , on the way make an effort to settle , so that he does not drag you before the judge , and the judge does not [ rule against you and ] turn you over to the officer , and the officer does not throw you into prison .

AMP	Luke	13	6	Then He began telling them this parable : “ A certain man had a fig tree that had been planted in his vineyard ; and he came looking for fruit on it , but did not find any ;
AMP	Luke	13	7	so he said to the vineyard-keeper , ‘ For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and have found none . Cut it down ! Why does it even use up the ground [ depleting the soil and blocking the sunlight ] ? ’
AMP	Luke	13	8	But he replied to him , ‘ Let it alone , sir , [ just ] one more year until I dig around it and put in fertilizer ;
AMP	Luke	13	9	and if it bears fruit after this , fine ; but if not , cut it down. ’ ” Healing on the Sabbath
AMP	Luke	13	10	Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
AMP	Luke	13	11	And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had an illness caused by a spirit ( demon ) . She was bent double , and could not straighten up at all .
AMP	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , He called her over and said to her , “ Woman , you are released from your illness. ”
AMP	Luke	13	14	But the leader of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , began saying to the crowd in response , “ There are six days in which work ought to be done ; so come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day. ” ( A )
AMP	Luke	13	15	But the Lord replied to him , “ You hypocrites ( play-actors , pretenders ) ! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it ?
AMP	Luke	13	16	And this woman , a daughter ( descendant ) of Abraham whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years , should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day ? ”
AMP	Luke	13	17	As He was saying this , all His opponents were being humiliated ; and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things that were being done by Him . Parables of Mustard Seed and Leaven
AMP	Luke	13	18	So this led Him to say , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? And to what shall I compare it ? ( B )
AMP	Luke	13	19	It is like a [ c ] mustard seed , which a man took and planted in his own garden ; and it grew and became a tree , and the birds of the sky found shelter and nested in its branches. ” ( C )
AMP	Luke	13	20	And again He said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
AMP	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three peck measures of flour until it was all leavened. ” ( D ) Teaching in the Villages
AMP	Luke	13	22	Jesus journeyed on through cities and villages , teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem .
AMP	Luke	13	23	And someone asked Him , “ Lord , will only a few be saved [ from the penalties of the last judgment ] ? ” And He said to them ,
AMP	Luke	13	24	“ Strive to enter through the narrow door [ force aside unbelief and the attractions of sin ] ; for many , I tell you , will try to enter [ by their own works ] and will not be able .
AMP	Luke	13	25	Once the head of the house gets up and closes the door , and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door [ again and again ] , saying , ‘ Lord , open to us ! ’ then He will answer you , ‘ I do not know where you are from [ for you are not of My household ] . ’
AMP	Luke	13	26	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in Your presence , and You taught in our streets ’ ;
AMP	Luke	13	27	but He will say to you , ‘ I do not know where you are from ; depart from Me , all you evildoers ! ’ ( E )
AMP	Luke	13	28	In that place there will be weeping [ in sorrow and pain ] and grinding of teeth [ in distress and anger ] when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves being thrown out and driven away .
AMP	Luke	13	29	And people will come from east and west , and from north and south , and they will sit down [ and feast at the table ] in the kingdom of God .
AMP	Luke	13	30	And behold , some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last. ”
AMP	Luke	13	31	At that very hour some Pharisees came up and said to Him , “ Leave and go away from here , because Herod [ Antipas ] wants to kill You. ”
AMP	Luke	13	32	And He said to them , “ Go and tell that fox [ that sly , cowardly man ] , ‘ Listen carefully : I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I reach My goal. ’
AMP	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must travel on today and tomorrow and the day after that—for it can not be that a prophet would die outside of Jerusalem .
AMP	Luke	13	34	[ d ] O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , who kills the prophets and stones [ to death ] those [ messengers ] who are sent to her [ by God ] ! How often I have wanted to gather your children together [ around Me ] , just as a hen gathers her young under her wings , but you were not willing ! ( F )
AMP	Luke	13	35	Listen carefully : your house is left to you desolate [ abandoned by God and destitute of His protection ] ; and I say to you , you will not see Me until the time comes when you say , ‘ Blessed [ to be celebrated with praise ] is He who comes in the name of the Lord ! ’ ” ( G ) Footnotes - Luke 13:1 These evidently were Jews who had come to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the temple .

AMP	Luke	14	2	And there in front of Him was a man who had [ a ] dropsy ( extreme swelling ) .
AMP	Luke	14	3	And Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? ”
AMP	Luke	14	4	But they kept silent . Then He took hold of the man and healed him , and sent him on his way .
AMP	Luke	14	5	Then He said to them , “ Which one of you , having a son or an ox that falls into a well , will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day ? ”
AMP	Luke	14	6	And they were unable to reply to this . Parable of the Guests
AMP	Luke	14	7	Now Jesus began telling a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been selecting the places of honor at the table , saying to them ,
AMP	Luke	14	8	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , do not sit down [ to eat ] at the place of honor , since a more distinguished person than you may have been invited by the host , ( A )
AMP	Luke	14	9	and he who invited both of you will come and say to you , ‘ Give this man your place , ’ and then , in disgrace you proceed to take the last place .
AMP	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , go and sit down [ to eat ] at the last place , so that when your host comes , he will say to you , ‘ Friend , move up higher ’ ; and then you will be honored in the presence of all who are at the table with you .
AMP	Luke	14	11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled [ before others ] , and he who habitually humbles himself ( keeps a realistic self-view ) will be exalted. ”
AMP	Luke	14	12	Jesus also went on to say to the one who had invited Him , “ When you give a luncheon or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or wealthy neighbors , otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment .
AMP	Luke	14	13	But when you give a banquet or a reception , invite the poor , the disabled , the lame , and the blind ,
AMP	Luke	14	15	When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this , he said to Him , “ Blessed ( happy , prosperous , to be admired ) is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ” Parable of the Dinner
AMP	Luke	14	16	But Jesus said to him , “ A man was giving a big dinner , and he invited many guests ;
AMP	Luke	14	17	and at the dinner hour he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited , ‘ Come , because everything is ready now. ’
AMP	Luke	14	18	But they all alike began to make excuses . The first one said to him , ‘ I have purchased a piece of land and I have to go out and see it ; please consider me excused. ’
AMP	Luke	14	19	Another one said , ‘ I have purchased five yoke of oxen , and I am going to try them out ; please consider me excused. ’
AMP	Luke	14	20	And another said , ‘ I have [ recently ] married a wife , and for that reason I am unable to come. ’ ( B )
AMP	Luke	14	21	So the servant came back and reported this to his master . Then [ his master , ] the head of the household , became angry [ at the rejections of his invitation ] and said to his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the disabled and the blind and the lame. ’
AMP	Luke	14	22	And the servant [ after returning ] said , ‘ Sir , what you commanded has been done , and still there is room. ’
AMP	Luke	14	23	Then the master told the servant , ‘ Go out into the highways and along the hedges , and compel them to come in , so that my house may be filled [ with guests ] .
AMP	Luke	14	24	For I tell you , not one of those who were invited [ and declined ] will taste my dinner. ’ ” Discipleship Tested
AMP	Luke	14	25	Now large crowds were going along with Jesus ; and He turned and said to them ,
AMP	Luke	14	26	“ If anyone comes to Me , and does not [ c ] hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , yes , and even his own life [ in the sense of indifference to or relative disregard for them in comparison with his attitude toward God ] —he can not be My disciple .
AMP	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not carry his own cross [ expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come ] and follow after Me [ believing in Me , conforming to My example in living and , if need be , suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me ] can not be My disciple .
AMP	Luke	14	28	For which one of you , when he wants to build a watchtower [ for his guards ] , does not first sit down and calculate the cost , to see if he has enough to finish it ?
AMP	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , when he has laid a foundation and is unable to finish [ the building ] , all who see it will begin to ridicule him ,
AMP	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish ! ’
AMP	Luke	14	31	Or what king , when he sets out to meet another king in battle , will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one who is coming against him with twenty thousand ?
AMP	Luke	14	32	Or else [ if he feels he is not powerful enough ] , while the other [ king ] is still a far distance away , he sends an envoy and asks for terms of peace .
AMP	Luke	14	33	So then , none of you can be My disciple who does not [ carefully consider the cost and then for My sake ] [ d ] give up all his own possessions .
AMP	Luke	14	34	“ Therefore , salt is good ; but if salt has become tasteless , with what will it be seasoned ?
AMP	Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile ; it is thrown away . He who has ears to hear , let him hear and heed My words. ” Footnotes - Luke 14:2 Or Edema , an abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in the connective tissue , causing swelling . - Luke 14:14 The death of Christ paid the penalty for the sins of believers . - Luke 14:26 An exaggerated figure of speech indicating a lesser degree of love , not actual hostility or aversion toward one ’ s earthly family . - Luke 14:33 Jesus probably is referring to a willingness and commitment to do so when necessary .

AMP	Luke	15	15	So he went and forced himself on one of the citizens of that country , who sent him into his fields to [ a ] feed pigs .
AMP	Luke	15	2	Both the Pharisees and the scribes began muttering and complaining , saying , “ This man accepts and welcomes sinners and eats with them. ”
AMP	Luke	15	3	So He told them this parable :
AMP	Luke	15	4	“ What man among you , if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them , does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost , [ searching ] until he finds it ? ( A )
AMP	Luke	15	5	And when he has found it , he lays it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
AMP	Luke	15	6	And when he gets home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I have found my lost sheep ! ’
AMP	Luke	15	7	I tell you , in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance . The Lost Coin
AMP	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman , if she has ten silver coins [ each one equal to a day ’ s wages ] and loses one coin , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it ?
AMP	Luke	15	9	And when she has found it , she calls together her [ women ] friends and neighbors , saying , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I found the lost coin ! ’
AMP	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents [ that is , changes his inner self—his old way of thinking , regrets past sins , lives his life in a way that proves repentance ; and seeks God ’ s purpose for his life ] . ” The Prodigal Son
AMP	Luke	15	11	Then He said , “ A certain man had two sons .
AMP	Luke	15	12	The younger of them [ inappropriately ] said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of the property that falls to me. ’ So he divided the estate between them . ( B )
AMP	Luke	15	13	A few days later , the younger son gathered together everything [ that he had ] and traveled to a distant country , and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and immoral living .
AMP	Luke	15	14	Now when he had spent everything , a severe famine occurred in that country , and he began to do without and be in need .
AMP	Luke	15	16	He would have gladly eaten the [ carob ] pods that the pigs were eating [ but they could not satisfy his hunger ] , and no one was giving anything to him . ( C )
AMP	Luke	15	17	But when he [ finally ] came to his senses , he said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired men have more than enough food , while I am dying here of hunger !
AMP	Luke	15	18	I will get up and go to my father , and I will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight .
AMP	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ; [ just ] treat me like one of your hired men. ” ’
AMP	Luke	15	20	So he got up and came to his father . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was moved with compassion for him , and ran and embraced him and kissed him .
AMP	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ; I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’
AMP	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , ‘ Quickly bring out the best robe [ for the guest of honor ] and put it on him ; and give him a [ b ] ring for his hand , and sandals for his feet . ( D )
AMP	Luke	15	23	And bring the fattened calf and slaughter it , and let us [ invite everyone and ] feast and celebrate ;
AMP	Luke	15	24	for this son of mine was [ as good as ] dead and is alive again ; he was lost and has been found. ’ So they began to celebrate .
AMP	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field ; and when he returned and approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
AMP	Luke	15	26	So he summoned one of the servants and began asking what this [ celebration ] meant .
AMP	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound. ’
AMP	Luke	15	28	But the elder brother became angry and deeply resentful and was not willing to go in ; and his father came out and began pleading with him .
AMP	Luke	15	29	But he said to his father , ‘ Look ! These many years I have served you , and I have never neglected or disobeyed your command . Yet you have never given me [ so much as ] a young goat , so that I might celebrate with my friends ;
AMP	Luke	15	30	but when this [ other ] son of yours arrived , who has devoured your estate with immoral women , you slaughtered that fattened calf for him ! ’
AMP	Luke	15	31	The father said to him , ‘ Son , you are always with me , and all that is mine is yours .
AMP	Luke	15	32	But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice , for this brother of yours was [ as good as ] dead and has begun to live . He was lost and has been found. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 15:15 This would have seemed especially disgusting to Jesus ’ Jewish listeners because pigs were ceremonially unclean animals , forbidden to them as food . - Luke 15:22 I.e . a symbol of his authority as a son .

AMP	Luke	17	11	While Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem , He was passing [ along the border ] between Samaria and Galilee .
AMP	Luke	17	12	As He entered a village , He was met by ten lepers who stood at a distance ;

AMP	Luke	17	19	Jesus said to him , “ Get up and go [ on your way ] . Your faith [ your personal trust in Me and your confidence in God ’ s power ] has restored you to health. ”
AMP	Luke	17	20	Now having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , He replied , “ The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed or with a visible display ;
AMP	Luke	17	21	nor will people say , ‘ Look ! Here it is ! ’ or , ‘ There it is ! ’ For the kingdom of God is among you [ because of My presence ] . ” Second Coming Foretold
AMP	Luke	17	22	Then He said to the disciples , “ The time will come when you will long to see [ even ] one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
AMP	Luke	17	23	They will say to you , ‘ Look [ the Messiah is ] there ! ’ or ‘ Look [ He is ] here ! ’ Do not go away [ to see Him ] , and do not run after them .

AMP	Luke	17	25	But first He must suffer many things and be repudiated and rejected and considered unfit [ to be the Messiah ] by this [ unbelieving ] generation .
AMP	Luke	17	26	And just as it was in the days of Noah , so it will be in the [ f ] time of [ the second coming of ] the Son of Man :
AMP	Luke	17	27	the people were [ g ] eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were being given in marriage , [ they were indifferent to God ] until the day that Noah went into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all . ( E )

AMP	Luke	18	2	saying , “ In a certain city there was a judge who did not fear God and had no respect for man .

AMP	Luke	18	9	He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves and were confident that they were righteous [ posing outwardly as upright and in right standing with God ] , and who viewed others with contempt :
AMP	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up into the temple [ enclosure ] to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
AMP	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood [ ostentatiously ] and began praying to himself [ in a self-righteous way , saying ] : ‘ God , I thank You that I am not like the rest of men—swindlers , unjust ( dishonest ) , adulterers—or even like this tax collector .
AMP	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week ; I pay tithes of all that I get. ’
AMP	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector , standing at a distance , would not even raise his eyes toward heaven , but was striking his chest [ in humility and repentance ] , saying , ‘ God , be merciful and gracious to me , the [ especially wicked ] sinner [ that I am ] ! ’
AMP	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went to his home justified [ forgiven of the guilt of sin and placed in right standing with God ] rather than the other man ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but he who humbles himself [ forsaking self-righteous pride ] will be exalted. ”
AMP	Luke	18	15	Now they were also bringing their babies to Him , so that He would touch and bless them , and when the disciples noticed it , they began reprimanding them .
AMP	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them to Himself , saying [ to the apostles ] , “ Allow the children to come to Me , and do not forbid them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
AMP	Luke	18	17	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God [ with faith and humility ] like a child will not enter it at all. ” The Rich Young Ruler
AMP	Luke	18	19	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call Me good ? No one is [ essentially and morally ] good except God alone .
AMP	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , Do not murder , Do not steal , Do not testify falsely , Honor your father and your mother. ’ ” ( B )
AMP	Luke	18	21	He replied , “ I have kept all these things from my youth. ”

AMP	Luke	18	23	But when he heard these things , he became very sad , for he was extremely rich .
AMP	Luke	18	24	Jesus looked at him and said , “ How difficult it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God !
AMP	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man [ who places his faith in wealth or status ] to enter the kingdom of God. ”

AMP	Luke	18	30	who will not receive many times as much in this present age and in the age to come , eternal life. ”
AMP	Luke	18	31	Then taking the [ c ] twelve [ disciples ] aside , He said to them , “ Listen carefully : we are going up to Jerusalem , and all things that have been written through the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled and completed . ( D )

AMP	Luke	19	11	While they were listening to these things , Jesus went on to tell a parable , because He was near Jerusalem , and they assumed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately [ as soon as He reached the city ] .
AMP	Luke	19	12	So He said , “ A nobleman went to a distant country to obtain for himself a kingdom , and [ then ] to return .
AMP	Luke	19	13	So he called ten of his servants , and gave them ten minas [ one apiece , each equal to about a hundred days ’ wages ] and said to them , ‘ Do business [ with this ] until I return. ’

AMP	Luke	19	15	When he returned , after receiving the kingdom , he ordered that these servants , to whom he had given the money , be called to him , that he might find out what business they had done .
AMP	Luke	19	16	The first one came before him and said , ‘ Lord , your mina has made ten more minas. ’
AMP	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good servant ! Because you proved yourself faithful and trustworthy in a very little thing , you shall [ now ] have authority over ten cities [ in my kingdom ] . ’
AMP	Luke	19	18	The second one came and said , ‘ Lord , your mina has made five minas. ’
AMP	Luke	19	20	Then another came and said , ‘ Lord , here is your mina , which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief [ for safekeeping ] .
AMP	Luke	19	21	I was [ always ] afraid of you , because you are a stern man ; you pick up what you did not lay down and you reap what you did not sow. ’
AMP	Luke	19	22	He said to the servant , ‘ I will judge and condemn you by your own words , you worthless servant ! Did you [ really ] know that I was a stern man , picking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow ?
AMP	Luke	19	23	Then why did you not [ at the very least ] put my money in a bank ? Then on my return , I would have collected it with interest. ’
AMP	Luke	19	24	Then he said to the bystanders , ‘ Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas. ’
AMP	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , ‘ Lord , he has ten minas already ! ’
AMP	Luke	19	26	[ Jesus explained , ] ‘ I tell you that to everyone who has [ because he valued his gifts from God and has used them wisely ] , more will be given ; but from the one who does not have [ because he disregarded his gifts from God ] , even what he has will be taken away. ’

AMP	Luke	19	28	After saying these things , Jesus went on ahead [ of them ] , going up to Jerusalem .
AMP	Luke	19	29	When He approached Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount that is called Olivet , He sent two of the disciples , ( B )

AMP	Luke	19	37	As soon as He was approaching [ Jerusalem ] , near the descent of the Mount of Olives , the entire multitude of the disciples [ all those who were or claimed to be His followers ] began praising God [ adoring Him enthusiastically and ] joyfully with loud voices for all the miracles and works of power that they had seen ,

AMP	Luke	20	10	At harvest time he sent a servant [ as his representative ] to the tenants , so that they would give him his share of the fruit of the vineyard ; but the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed .
AMP	Luke	20	11	So he again sent another servant ; they also beat him and dishonored and treated him disgracefully and sent him away empty-handed .
AMP	Luke	20	12	And he sent yet a third ; and this one too they wounded and threw out [ of the vineyard ] .
AMP	Luke	20	13	Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will have respect for him. ’
AMP	Luke	20	14	But when the tenants saw him , they discussed it among themselves , saying , ‘ This [ man ] is the heir ; let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours. ’
AMP	Luke	20	15	So they threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him . What , then , will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
AMP	Luke	20	16	He will come and put these tenants to death and will give the vineyard to others. ” When the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders heard this , they said , “ May it never be ! ”
AMP	Luke	20	17	But Jesus looked at them and said , “ What then is [ the meaning of ] this that is written : ‘ The [ very ] Stone which the builders rejected , this became the chief Cornerstone ’ ? ( C )
AMP	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken and shattered in pieces ; and on whomever it falls , it will crush him. ” ( D ) Tribute to Caesar
AMP	Luke	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests tried to [ find a way to ] arrest Him at that very hour , but they were afraid of the people ; because they understood that He spoke this parable against them .
AMP	Luke	20	21	They asked Him , “ Teacher , we know that You speak and teach correctly , and that You show no partiality to anyone , but teach the way of God truthfully .
AMP	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful [ according to Jewish law and tradition ] for us to pay taxes ( tribute money ) to [ b ] Caesar or not ? ”
AMP	Luke	20	23	But He saw through their trickery and said to them ,
AMP	Luke	20	24	“ Show Me a [ Roman ] denarius . Whose image and inscription does the coin have ? ” They answered , “ [ the Emperor Tiberius ] Caesar ’ s. ”
AMP	Luke	20	25	He said to them , “ Then pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
AMP	Luke	20	26	They were not able to seize on anything He said in the presence of the people ; and being unnerved at His reply , they were silent . Is There a Resurrection ?
AMP	Luke	20	27	Now some of the Sadducees ( who say that there is no resurrection ) came to Him ( F )
AMP	Luke	20	28	and they questioned Him , saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us [ a law that ] if a man ’ s brother dies , leaving a wife and no children , his brother should [ c ] marry the wife and raise children for his brother . ( G )
AMP	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers ; and the first took a wife and died childless .
AMP	Luke	20	30	And the second ,
AMP	Luke	20	31	and the third married her , and in the same way all seven died , leaving no children .
AMP	Luke	20	32	Finally the woman also died .
AMP	Luke	20	33	So in the [ life after ] resurrection , whose wife does she become ? For all seven had married her. ”
AMP	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ The sons of this [ world and present ] age marry and [ the women ] are given in marriage ;
AMP	Luke	20	35	but those who are considered worthy to gain that [ other world and that future ] age and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ;
AMP	Luke	20	36	and they can not die again , because they are [ immortal ] like the angels ( equal to , angel-like ) . And they are [ d ] children of God , being [ e ] participants in the resurrection .
AMP	Luke	20	37	But [ as for the fact ] that the dead are raised [ from death ] , even Moses showed , in the passage about the burning bush , when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ( H )
AMP	Luke	20	38	Now He is not the God of the dead , but of the living [ so these forefathers will be among the resurrected ] ; for all live [ in a definite relationship ] to Him. ”
AMP	Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes replied , “ Teacher , you have spoken well [ so that there is no room for blame ] . ”
AMP	Luke	20	40	And they did not dare to question Him further about anything [ because of the wisdom He displayed in His answers ] .
AMP	Luke	20	41	Then He said to them , “ How is it that people say that the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) is David ’ s son ? ( I )
AMP	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘ The Lord ( the Father ) said to my Lord ( the Son , the Messiah ) , “ Sit at My right hand ,
AMP	Luke	20	43	Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet. ” ’ ( J )
AMP	Luke	20	44	[ f ] So David calls Him ( the Son ) ‘ Lord , ’ and how then is He David ’ s son ? ”
AMP	Luke	20	45	And with all the people listening , He said to His disciples ,
AMP	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes [ displaying their prominence ] , and love respectful greetings in the [ crowded ] market places , and [ g ] chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets .
AMP	Luke	20	47	These [ men ] who confiscate and devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretense [ to appear devout ] offer long prayers .

AMP	Luke	21	21	At that time , those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains , and those who are inside the city ( Jerusalem ) must get out , and those who are [ out ] in the country must not enter the city ;
AMP	Luke	21	2	And He saw a poor widow putting in two [ a ] small copper coins .
AMP	Luke	21	3	He said , “ Truly I say to you , this poor widow has put in [ proportionally ] more than all of them ;
AMP	Luke	21	4	for they all put in gifts from their abundance ; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on. ”
AMP	Luke	21	5	As some were talking about the [ b ] temple , that it was decorated with beautiful stones and consecrated offerings [ of magnificent gifts of gold which were displayed on the walls and hung in the porticoes ] , He said , ( B )
AMP	Luke	21	6	“ As for all these things which you see , the time will come when there will not be one stone left on another that will not be [ c ] torn down. ”
AMP	Luke	21	7	They asked Him , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen ? ”
AMP	Luke	21	8	He said , “ Be careful and see to it that you are not misled ; for many will come in My name [ appropriating for themselves the name Messiah which belongs to Me alone ] , saying , ‘ I am He , ’ and , ‘ The time is near ! ’ Do not follow them .
AMP	Luke	21	9	When you hear of wars and disturbances [ civil unrest , revolts , uprisings ] , do not panic ; for these things must take place first , but the end will not come immediately. ” Things to Come
AMP	Luke	21	10	Then Jesus told them , “ Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom . ( C )
AMP	Luke	21	11	There will be violent earthquakes , and in various places famines and [ deadly and devastating ] pestilences ( plagues , epidemics ) ; and there will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven .
AMP	Luke	21	12	“ But before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you , turning you over to the synagogues and prisons , and bringing you before kings and governors for My name ’ s sake . ( D )
AMP	Luke	21	13	This will be a time and an opportunity for you to testify [ about Me ] .
AMP	Luke	21	14	So make up your minds not to prepare beforehand to defend yourselves ;
AMP	Luke	21	15	for I will give you [ skillful ] words and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute .
AMP	Luke	21	16	But you will be betrayed and handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends , and they will put some of you to death ,
AMP	Luke	21	17	and you will be continually hated by everyone because of [ your association with ] My name .
AMP	Luke	21	18	But not a hair of your head will perish . ( E )

AMP	Luke	21	23	Woe to those women who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days ! For great trouble and anguish will be on the land , and wrath and retribution on this people [ Israel ] .
AMP	Luke	21	24	And they will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all nations ; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled ( completed ) . ( F ) The Return of Christ
AMP	Luke	21	25	“ There will be signs ( attesting miracles ) in the sun and moon and stars ; and on the earth [ there will be ] distress and anguish among nations , in perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea and the waves , ( G )
AMP	Luke	21	26	people fainting from fear and expectation of the [ dreadful ] things coming on the world ; for the [ very ] powers of the heavens will be shaken .
AMP	Luke	21	27	Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with [ transcendent , overwhelming ] power [ subduing the nations ] and with great glory . ( H )
AMP	Luke	21	28	Now when these things begin to occur , stand tall and lift up your heads [ in joy ] , because [ suffering ends as ] your redemption is drawing near. ” Parable of the Fig Tree
AMP	Luke	21	29	Then He told them a parable : “ Look at the fig tree and all the trees ; ( I )
AMP	Luke	21	30	as soon as they put out leaves , you see it and know for yourselves that summer is near .
AMP	Luke	21	31	So you too , when you see these things happening , know [ without any doubt ] that the kingdom of God is near .

AMP	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth will pass away , but My words will not pass away .
AMP	Luke	21	34	“ But be on guard , so that your hearts are not weighed down and depressed with the giddiness of debauchery and the nausea of self-indulgence and the worldly worries of life , and then that day [ when the Messiah returns ] will not come on you suddenly like a trap ;

AMP	Luke	21	36	But keep alert at all times [ be attentive and ready ] , praying that you may have the strength and ability [ to be found worthy and ] to escape all these things that are going to take place , and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man [ at His coming ] . ”
AMP	Luke	21	37	Now in the daytime Jesus was teaching in [ the porches and courts of ] the temple , but at night He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet .

AMP	Luke	22	2	The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put Him to death ; for they were afraid of the people [ who listened devotedly to His teaching , and who respected His spiritual wisdom ] .
AMP	Luke	22	3	Then Satan entered Judas , the one called Iscariot , who was one of the twelve [ disciples ] .
AMP	Luke	22	4	And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray Him and hand Him over to them .
AMP	Luke	22	5	They were delighted and agreed with him to give him money .
AMP	Luke	22	6	So he consented , and began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus to them [ at a time when He was ] separated from the crowd [ because the people might riot or stop them from seizing Him ] .
AMP	Luke	22	7	Then came the preparation day of [ a ] Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed . ( B )
AMP	Luke	22	8	So Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal for us , so that we may eat it. ”
AMP	Luke	22	9	They asked Him , “ Where do You want us to prepare it ? ”
AMP	Luke	22	10	He replied , “ When you have entered the city , a [ b ] man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you ; follow him into the house that he enters .
AMP	Luke	22	11	And say to the owner of the house , ‘ The Teacher asks , “ Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples ? ” ’
AMP	Luke	22	12	Then he will show you a large upstairs room , furnished [ with carpets and dining couches ] ; prepare the meal there. ”

AMP	Luke	22	18	for I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes. ”
AMP	Luke	22	19	And when He had taken bread and given thanks , He broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is My body which is given for you ; do this in remembrance of Me. ”
AMP	Luke	22	20	And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup , which is poured out for you , is the new covenant [ ratified ] in My blood .
AMP	Luke	22	21	But listen , the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table . ( D )
AMP	Luke	22	23	And they began to discuss among themselves which one of them it might be who was going to do this . Who Is Greatest ?
AMP	Luke	22	24	Now a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was regarded to be the greatest .
AMP	Luke	22	25	Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles have absolute power and lord it over them ; and those in authority over them are called ‘ Benefactors. ’ ( E )
AMP	Luke	22	26	But it is not to be this way with you ; on the contrary , the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest [ and least privileged ] , and the [ one who is the ] leader , like the servant .
AMP	Luke	22	27	For who is the greater , the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves ? Is it not the one who reclines at the table ? But I am among you as the one who serves .
AMP	Luke	22	28	“ You are those who have remained and have stood by Me in My trials ;
AMP	Luke	22	29	and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom , I grant you [ the privilege ]

AMP	Luke	22	31	“ Simon , Simon ( Peter ) , listen ! Satan has demanded permission to sift [ all of ] you like grain ; ( F )

AMP	Luke	22	33	And Peter said to Him , “ Lord , I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death ! ” ( G )
AMP	Luke	22	34	Jesus said , “ I say to you , Peter , before the rooster crows today , you will [ utterly ] deny three times that you know Me. ”
AMP	Luke	22	35	And He said to them , “ When I sent you out without a money belt and [ provision ] bag and [ extra ] sandals , did you lack anything ? ” They answered , “ Nothing. ”
AMP	Luke	22	36	Then He said to them , “ But now , he who has a money belt is to take it along , and also his [ provision ] bag , and he who has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one .
AMP	Luke	22	37	For I tell you that this [ Scripture ] which is written must be completed and fulfilled in Me : ‘ And He was counted with the criminals ’ ; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment [ and is settled ] . ” ( H )

AMP	Luke	22	47	While He was still speaking , a crowd came , and the man called Judas , one of the twelve [ disciples ] , was leading the way for them . He approached Jesus to [ f ] kiss Him . ( K )
AMP	Luke	22	48	And Jesus said to him , “ Judas , are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”

AMP	Luke	23	2	They began to accuse Jesus , asserting , “ We found this Man misleading and perverting our nation and forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar , and claiming that He Himself is Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , a King. ” ( A )
AMP	Luke	23	3	So Pilate asked Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ” And He answered him , “ It is just as you say. ”

AMP	Luke	23	35	Now the people stood by , watching ; but even the rulers ridiculed and sneered at Him , saying , “ He saved others [ from death ] ; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) of God , His Chosen One. ”

AMP	Luke	24	24	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just exactly as the women had said , but they did not see Him. ”
AMP	Luke	24	2	And they found the [ large , circular ] stone rolled back from the tomb ,
AMP	Luke	24	3	but when they went inside , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
AMP	Luke	24	4	While they were perplexed and wondering about this , suddenly , two men in dazzling clothing stood near them ;
AMP	Luke	24	5	and as the women were terrified and were bowing their faces to the ground , the men said to them , “ Why are you looking for the living One among the dead ?
AMP	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but has risen . Remember how He told you , while He was still in Galilee ,
AMP	Luke	24	7	saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men , and be crucified , and on the third day rise [ from death to life ] . ” ( B )
AMP	Luke	24	8	And they remembered His words ,
AMP	Luke	24	9	and after returning from the tomb , they reported all these things to the eleven [ apostles ] and to all the rest .
AMP	Luke	24	10	Now they were Mary Magdalene and Joanna [ the wife of Chuza , Herod ’ s steward ] and Mary the mother of James ; also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles .
AMP	Luke	24	11	But their report seemed to them like idle talk and nonsense , and they would not believe them .
AMP	Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Stooping [ at the small entrance ] and looking in , he saw only the linen [ a ] wrappings ; and he went away , wondering about what had happened . ( C ) The Road to Emmaus
AMP	Luke	24	13	And then , that very day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus , which was about [ b ] seven miles from Jerusalem . ( D )
AMP	Luke	24	14	And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place .
AMP	Luke	24	15	While they were talking and discussing it , Jesus Himself came up and began walking with them .
AMP	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were [ miraculously ] prevented from recognizing Him .
AMP	Luke	24	17	Then Jesus asked them , “ What are you discussing with one another as you walk along ? ” And they stood still , looking brokenhearted .
AMP	Luke	24	18	One of them , named Cleopas , answered Him , “ Are you the only stranger visiting Jerusalem who is unaware of the things which have happened here in these [ recent ] days ? ”
AMP	Luke	24	19	He asked , “ What things ? ” And they replied , “ The things about Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet powerful in deed and word in the sight of God and all the people ,
AMP	Luke	24	20	and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death , and crucified Him .
AMP	Luke	24	21	But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel and set our nation free . Indeed , besides all this , it is the third day since these things happened .
AMP	Luke	24	22	And also some of the women among us shocked us . They were at the tomb early in the morning ,
AMP	Luke	24	23	and they did not find His body . Then they came back , saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive !
AMP	Luke	24	25	Then Jesus said to them , “ O foolish men , and slow of heart to trust and believe in everything that the prophets have spoken !
AMP	Luke	24	26	Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and [ only then to ] enter His glory ? ”
AMP	Luke	24	27	Then beginning with Moses and [ throughout ] all the [ writings of the ] prophets , He explained and interpreted for them the things referring to Himself [ found ] in all the Scriptures .
AMP	Luke	24	28	Then they approached the village where they were going , and He acted as if He were going farther .
AMP	Luke	24	29	But they urged Him [ not to go on ] , saying , “ Stay with us , because it is almost evening , and the day has just about ended. ” So He went inside to stay with them .
AMP	Luke	24	30	And it happened that as He reclined at the table with them , He took the bread and blessed it , and breaking it , He began giving it to them .
AMP	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were [ suddenly ] opened [ by God ] and they [ clearly ] recognized Him ; and He vanished from their sight .
AMP	Luke	24	32	They said to one another , “ Were not our hearts burning within us while He was talking with us on the road and opening the Scriptures to us ? ”
AMP	Luke	24	33	They got up that very hour and went back to Jerusalem , and found the eleven [ apostles ] gathered together and those who were with them ,
AMP	Luke	24	34	saying , “ The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon [ Peter ] ! ”
AMP	Luke	24	35	They began describing in detail what had happened on the road , and how Jesus was recognized by them when He broke the bread . Other Appearances
AMP	Luke	24	36	While they were talking about this , Jesus Himself [ suddenly ] stood among them and said to them , “ Peace be to you. ”
AMP	Luke	24	37	But they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a spirit .
AMP	Luke	24	38	And He said , “ Why are you troubled , and why are doubts rising in your hearts ?
AMP	Luke	24	39	Look at [ the marks in ] My hands and My feet , [ and see ] that it is I Myself . Touch Me and see ; a spirit does not have flesh and bones , as you see that I have. ” ( E )
AMP	Luke	24	40	After saying this , He showed them His hands and His feet .
AMP	Luke	24	41	While they still did not believe it because of their joy and amazement , He asked them , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
AMP	Luke	24	42	They gave Him a piece of broiled fish ,
AMP	Luke	24	43	and He took it and ate it in front of them . ( F )
AMP	Luke	24	44	Then He said to them , “ This is what I told you while I was still with you , everything which has been written about Me in the [ c ] Law of Moses and the [ writings of the ] Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. ”
AMP	Luke	24	45	Then He opened their minds to [ help them ] understand the Scriptures ,
AMP	Luke	24	46	and said , “ And so it is written , that the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day , ( G )
AMP	Luke	24	47	and that repentance [ necessary ] for forgiveness of sins would be preached in His name to all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
AMP	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
AMP	Luke	24	49	Listen carefully : I am sending the Promise of My Father [ the Holy Spirit ] upon you ; but you are to remain in the city [ of Jerusalem ] until you are clothed ( fully equipped ) with power from on high. ” ( H ) The Ascension
AMP	Luke	24	50	Then He led them out as far as Bethany , and lifted up His hands and blessed them . ( I )
AMP	Luke	24	51	While He was blessing them , He left them and was taken up into heaven .
AMP	Luke	24	52	And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy [ fully understanding that He lives and that He is the Son of God ] ;
AMP	Luke	24	53	and they were continually in the temple blessing and praising God . Footnotes - Luke 24:12 See note John 20:5 . - Luke 24:13 Lit sixty stadia , a Roman measurement . - Luke 24:44 I.e . the entire Old Testament . Copyright ©

AMP	John	1	7	This man came as a witness , to testify about the Light , so that all might believe [ in Christ , the Light ] through him .

AMP	John	1	19	) , he sees Christ returning as Warrior-Messiah-King , and “ ... His name is called The Word of God ... and LORD OF LORDS. ” ( Rev 19:13 ,
AMP	John	1	20	And he confessed [ truthfully ] and did not deny [ that he was only a man ] , but acknowledged , “ I am not the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) ! ”
AMP	John	1	21	They asked him , “ What then ? Are you Elijah ? ” And he said , “ I am not. ” “ Are you the [ promised ] Prophet ? ” And he answered , “ No. ” ( I )
AMP	John	1	22	Then they said to him , “ Who are you ? Tell us , so that we may give an answer to those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
AMP	John	1	23	He said , “ I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight the way of the Lord , ’ as the prophet Isaiah said. ” ( J )
AMP	John	1	24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees .
AMP	John	1	25	They asked him , “ Why then are you baptizing , if you are not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ”
AMP	John	1	26	John answered them , “ I baptize [ only ] [ g ] in water , but among you there stands One whom you do not recognize and of whom you know nothing . ( K )
AMP	John	1	27	It is He [ the preeminent One ] who comes after me , the [ h ] strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie [ even as His slave ] . ”
AMP	John	1	28	These things occurred in Bethany across the Jordan [ at the Jordan River crossing ] , where John was baptizing .
AMP	John	1	29	The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God [ i ] who takes away the sin of the world ! ( L )
AMP	John	1	30	This is He on behalf of whom I said , ‘ After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I and has priority over me , for He existed before me. ’
AMP	John	1	31	[ j ] I did not recognize Him [ as the Messiah ] ; but I came baptizing [ k ] in water so that He would be [ publicly ] revealed to Israel. ”
AMP	John	1	32	John gave [ further ] evidence [ testifying officially for the record , with validity and relevance ] , saying , “ I have seen the [ l ] Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven , and He remained upon Him . ( M )
AMP	John	1	33	I did not recognize Him [ as the Messiah ] , but He who sent me to baptize [ m ] in water said to me , ‘ He upon whom you see the Spirit descend and remain , this One is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. ’
AMP	John	1	34	I myself have [ actually ] seen [ that happen ] , and my testimony is that this is the Son of God ! ” Jesus ’ Public Ministry , First Converts
AMP	John	1	35	Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples ,
AMP	John	1	36	and he looked at Jesus as He walked along , and said , “ Look ! The Lamb of God ! ”
AMP	John	1	37	The two disciples heard him say this , and they [ n ] followed Jesus .
AMP	John	1	38	And Jesus turned and saw them following Him , and asked them , “ What do you want ? ” They answered Him , “ Rabbi ( which translated means Teacher ) , where are You staying ? ”
AMP	John	1	39	He said to them , “ Come , and you will see. ” So they went [ with Him ] and saw where He was staying ; and they stayed with Him that day , for it was about the [ o ] tenth hour .
AMP	John	1	40	One of the two who heard what John said and [ as a result ] followed Jesus was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
AMP	John	1	41	He first looked for and found his own brother Simon and told him , “ We have found the [ p ] Messiah ” ( which translated means the Christ ) .
AMP	John	1	42	Andrew brought Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon the son of John . You shall be called Cephas ( which is translated [ q ] Peter ) . ”
AMP	John	1	43	The next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee , and He found Philip and said to him , “ Follow Me [ as My disciple , accepting Me as your Master and Teacher , and walking the same path of life that I walk ] . ”
AMP	John	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
AMP	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the One Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote about—Jesus from Nazareth , the son of Joseph [ according to public record ] . ”
AMP	John	1	46	Nathanael answered him , “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip replied , “ Come and see. ”
AMP	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him , and said of him , “ Here is an Israelite indeed [ a true descendant of Jacob ] , in whom there is no guile nor deceit nor duplicity ! ”
AMP	John	1	48	Nathanael said to Jesus , “ How do You know [ these things about ] me ? ” Jesus answered , “ Before Philip called you , when you were still under the fig tree , I saw you. ”
AMP	John	1	49	Nathanael answered , “ Rabbi ( Teacher ) , You are the Son of God ; You are the King of Israel. ”
AMP	John	1	50	Jesus replied , “ Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree , do you believe [ in Me ] ? You will see greater things than this. ”
AMP	John	1	51	Then He said to him , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man [ the bridge between heaven and earth ] . ” ( N ) Footnotes - John 1:1 In John the Apostle ’ s vision ( Rev

AMP	John	2	2	and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding .
AMP	John	2	3	When the wine was all gone , the mother of Jesus said to Him , “ [ a ] They have no more wine. ”
AMP	John	2	4	Jesus said to her , “ [ Dear ] woman , [ b ] what is that to you and to Me ? My time [ to act and to be revealed ] has not yet come. ” ( A )
AMP	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Whatever He says to you , do it. ”
AMP	John	2	6	Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification ( ceremonial washing ) , containing twenty or thirty gallons each .
AMP	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the waterpots with water. ” So they filled them up to the brim .
AMP	John	2	8	Then He said to them , “ Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter [ of the banquet ] . ” So they took it to him .
AMP	John	2	9	And when the headwaiter tasted the water which had turned into wine , not knowing where it came from ( though the servants who had drawn the water knew ) he called the bridegroom ,
AMP	John	2	10	and said to him , “ Everyone else serves his best wine first , and when people have [ c ] drunk freely , then he serves that which is not so good ; but you have kept back the good wine until now. ”
AMP	John	2	11	This , the first of His signs ( attesting miracles ) , Jesus did in Cana of Galilee , and revealed His glory [ displaying His deity and His great power openly ] , and His disciples believed [ confidently ] in Him [ as the Messiah—they adhered to , trusted in , and relied on Him ] . ( B )
AMP	John	2	12	After this He went down to Capernaum , He and His mother and brothers and His disciples ; and they stayed there a few days . First Passover—Cleansing the Temple
AMP	John	2	13	Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching , so Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
AMP	John	2	14	And in the temple [ enclosure ] He found the [ d ] people who were selling oxen and sheep and doves , and the money changers sitting at their tables . ( C )
AMP	John	2	15	He made a whip of cords , and drove them all out of the temple , with the sheep and the oxen ; and He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables ;
AMP	John	2	16	then to those who sold the doves He said , “ Take these things away ! Stop making My Father ’ s house a place of commerce ! ” ( D )
AMP	John	2	17	His disciples remembered that it is written [ in the Scriptures ] , “ Zeal ( love , concern ) for Your house [ and its honor ] will consume Me. ” ( E )
AMP	John	2	18	Then the Jews retorted , “ What sign ( attesting miracle ) can You show us as [ proof of ] your authority for doing these things ? ”
AMP	John	2	19	Jesus answered them , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up. ”
AMP	John	2	20	Then the Jews replied , “ It took forty-six years to build this temple , and You will raise it up in three days ? ”
AMP	John	2	21	But He was speaking of the temple which was His body .
AMP	John	2	22	So when He had risen from the dead , His disciples remembered what He had said . And they believed and trusted in and relied on the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken . ( F )
AMP	John	2	23	Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast , many believed in His name [ identifying themselves with Him ] after seeing His signs ( attesting miracles ) which He was doing .
AMP	John	2	24	But Jesus , for His part , did not entrust Himself to them , because He knew all people [ and understood the [ e ] superficiality and fickleness of human nature ] ,
AMP	John	2	25	and He did not need anyone to testify concerning man [ and human nature ] , for He Himself knew what was in man [ in their hearts—in the very core of their being ] .

AMP	John	3	16	“ For God so [ greatly ] loved and dearly prized the world , that He [ even ] gave His [ One and ] [ a ] only begotten Son , so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [ as Savior ] shall not perish , but have eternal life .
AMP	John	3	17	For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world [ that is , to initiate the final judgment of the world ] , but that the world might be saved through Him .
AMP	John	3	18	Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [ as personal Savior and Lord ] is not judged [ for this one , there is no judgment , no rejection , no condemnation ] ; but the one who does not believe [ and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord ] is judged already [ that one has been convicted and sentenced ] , because [ b ] he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [ One and ] only begotten Son of God [ the One who is truly unique , the only One of His kind , the One who alone can save him ] .
AMP	John	3	19	This is the judgment [ that is , the cause for indictment , the test by which people are judged , the basis for the sentence ] : the Light has come into the world , and people loved the [ c ] darkness rather than the Light , for their deeds were evil . ( C )
AMP	John	3	20	For every wrongdoer hates the Light , and does not come to the Light [ but shrinks from it ] for fear that his [ sinful , worthless ] activities will be exposed and condemned .
AMP	John	3	21	But whoever practices truth [ and does what is right—morally , ethically , spiritually ] comes to the Light , so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [ divinely prompted , done with God ’ s help , in dependence on Him ] . ” John ’ s Last Testimony
AMP	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and His disciples went into the land of Judea , and there He spent time with them and baptized . ( D )
AMP	John	3	23	Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because there was an abundance of water there ; and people were coming and were being baptized—
AMP	John	3	24	for John had not yet been thrown into prison .
AMP	John	3	25	Therefore there arose a controversy between John ’ s disciples and a Jew in regard to [ d ] purification ( ceremonial washing ) .
AMP	John	3	26	So they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi ( Teacher ) , the Man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan [ at the Jordan River crossing ] —and to whom you have testified—look , He is baptizing too , and everyone is going to Him ! ”
AMP	John	3	27	John replied , “ A man can receive nothing [ he can claim nothing at all ] unless it has been granted to him from heaven [ for there is no other source than the sovereign will of God ] .
AMP	John	3	28	You yourselves are my witnesses that I stated , ‘ I am not the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , ’ but , ‘ I have [ only ] been sent ahead of Him [ as His appointed forerunner and messenger to announce and proclaim His coming ] . ’ ( E )
AMP	John	3	29	He who has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands by and listens to him , rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom ’ s voice . So this pleasure and joy of mine is now complete . ( F )
AMP	John	3	30	He must increase [ in prominence ] , but I must decrease . ( G )
AMP	John	3	31	“ He who comes from [ heaven ] above is above all others ; he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks [ about things ] of the earth [ his viewpoint and experience are earthly ] . He who comes from heaven is above all .
AMP	John	3	32	What He has [ actually ] seen and heard , of that He testifies ; and yet no one accepts His testimony [ as true ] .
AMP	John	3	33	Whoever receives His testimony has set his seal [ of approval ] to this : God is true [ and he knows that God can not lie ] .
AMP	John	3	34	For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God [ proclaiming the Father ’ s own message ] ; for God gives the [ gift of the ] Spirit without measure [ generously and boundlessly ] ! ( H )
AMP	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given and entrusted all things into His hand . ( I )
AMP	John	3	36	He who believes and trusts in the Son and accepts Him [ as Savior ] has eternal life [ that is , already possesses it ] ; but he who does not believe the Son and chooses to reject Him , [ disobeying Him and denying Him as Savior ] will not see [ eternal ] life , but [ instead ] the wrath of God hangs over him continually. ” ( J ) Footnotes - John 3:16 Jesus , God ’ s only Son , the One who is truly unique , the only one of His kind . - John 3:18 The Greek refers to an unsaved person who has made the decision not to believe in the Son , Jesus Christ , that is , not to accept the salvation offered by the Son and commit to follow Him . Such a person stands condemned by God unless he changes his mind . - John 3:19 See note 1:5 . - John 3:25 An immersion baptism was one of the requirements for a convert to Judaism , and John the Baptist had most likely taken over the ritual , giving it new meaning in his own ministry .

AMP	John	4	4	Now [ a ] He had to go through [ b ] Samaria .
AMP	John	4	2	( although Jesus Himself was not baptizing , but His disciples were ) ,
AMP	John	4	3	He left Judea and returned again to Galilee .
AMP	John	4	5	So He arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar , near the tract of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph ;
AMP	John	4	6	and Jacob ’ s well was there . So Jesus , tired as He was from His journey , sat down by the well . It was then about the sixth hour ( noon ) . The Samaritan Woman
AMP	John	4	7	Then a woman from Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give Me a drink ” —
AMP	John	4	8	For His disciples had gone off into the city to buy food—
AMP	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman asked Him , “ How is it that You , being a Jew , ask me , a [ c ] Samaritan woman , for a drink ? ” ( For Jews have nothing to do with Samaritans . )
AMP	John	4	10	Jesus answered her , “ If you knew [ about ] God ’ s gift [ of eternal life ] , and who it is who says , ‘ Give Me a drink , ’ you would have asked Him [ instead ] , and He would have given you living water ( eternal life ) . ”
AMP	John	4	11	She said to Him , “ Sir , [ d ] You have nothing to draw with [ no bucket and rope ] and the well is deep . Where then do You get that living water ?
AMP	John	4	12	Are You greater than our father [ e ] Jacob , who gave us the well , and who used to drink from it himself , and his sons and his cattle also ? ”
AMP	John	4	13	Jesus answered her , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
AMP	John	4	14	But whoever drinks the water that I give him will never be thirsty again . But the water that I give him will become in him a spring of water [ satisfying his thirst for God ] welling up [ continually flowing , bubbling within him ] to eternal life. ”
AMP	John	4	15	The woman said to Him , “ Sir , give me this water , so that I will not get thirsty nor [ have to continually ] come all the way here to draw. ”
AMP	John	4	16	At this , Jesus said , “ Go , call your husband and come back. ”
AMP	John	4	17	The woman answered , “ I do not have a husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You have correctly said , ‘ I do not have a husband ’ ;
AMP	John	4	18	for you have had five husbands , and the man you are now living with is not your [ f ] husband . You have said this truthfully. ”
AMP	John	4	19	The woman said to Him , “ Sir , I see that You are a prophet .
AMP	John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , but you Jews say that the place where one ought to worship is in Jerusalem [ at the temple ] . ”
AMP	John	4	21	Jesus replied , “ Woman , believe Me , a time is coming [ when God ’ s kingdom comes ] when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
AMP	John	4	22	You [ Samaritans ] do not know what you worship ; we [ Jews ] do know what we worship , for salvation is from the Jews .
AMP	John	4	23	But a time is coming and is already here when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit [ from the heart , the inner self ] and in truth ; for the Father seeks such people to be His worshipers .
AMP	John	4	24	God is spirit [ the Source of life , yet invisible to mankind ] , and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth. ”
AMP	John	4	25	The woman said to Him , “ I know that Messiah is coming ( He who is called Christ—the Anointed ) ; when that One comes , He will tell us everything [ we need to know ] . ”
AMP	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , “ I who speak to you , am He ( the Messiah ) . ”
AMP	John	4	27	Just then His disciples came , and they were surprised to find Him talking with a woman . However , no one said , “ What are You asking about ? ” or , “ Why are You talking to her ? ”
AMP	John	4	28	Then the woman left her water jar , and went into the city and began telling the people ,
AMP	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man who told me all the things that I have done ! Can this be the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) ? ”
AMP	John	4	30	So the people left the city and were coming to Him .
AMP	John	4	31	Meanwhile , the disciples were urging Jesus [ to have a meal ] , saying , “ Rabbi ( Teacher ) , eat. ”
AMP	John	4	32	But He told them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about. ”
AMP	John	4	33	So the disciples said to one another , “ Has anyone brought Him something to eat ? ”
AMP	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , “ My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to completely finish His work .
AMP	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ It is still four months until the harvest comes ? ’ Look , I say to you , raise your eyes and look at the fields and see , they are white for harvest .
AMP	John	4	36	Already the reaper is receiving his wages and he is gathering fruit for eternal life ; so that he who plants and he who reaps may rejoice together .
AMP	John	4	37	For in this case the saying is true , ‘ One [ person ] sows and another reaps. ’
AMP	John	4	38	I sent you to reap [ a crop ] for which you have not worked . Others have worked and you have been privileged to reap the results of their work. ” The Samaritans
AMP	John	4	39	Now many Samaritans from that city believed in Him and trusted Him [ as Savior ] because of what the woman said when she testified , “ He told me all the things that I have done. ”
AMP	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to Jesus , they asked Him to remain with them ; and He stayed there two days .
AMP	John	4	41	Many more believed in Him [ with a deep , abiding trust ] because of His word [ His personal message to them ] ;
AMP	John	4	42	and they told the woman , “ We no longer believe just because of what you said ; for [ now ] we have heard Him for ourselves and know [ with confident assurance ] that this One is truly the Savior of [ all ] the world. ”
AMP	John	4	43	After the two days He went on from there into Galilee .
AMP	John	4	44	( For Jesus Himself declared ... ) , the Galileans evidently were very interested in His miracles , but did not recognize or regard Jesus as their source of salvation . - John 4:46 Probably an official of Herod Antipas . - John 4:47 Capernaum to Cana was about eighteen miles .

AMP	John	4	45	So when He arrived in Galilee , the Galileans [ g ] welcomed Him , since they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they too came to the feast . Healing a Nobleman ’ s Son
AMP	John	4	46	So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee , where He had turned the water into wine . And there was a [ h ] certain royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum .
AMP	John	4	47	Having heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee , he [ i ] went to meet Him and began asking Him to come down and heal his son ; for he was at the point of death .
AMP	John	4	48	Then Jesus said to him , “ Unless you [ people ] see [ miraculous ] signs and wonders , you [ simply ] will not believe. ”
AMP	John	4	49	The royal official pleaded with Him , “ Sir , do come down [ at once ] before my child dies ! ”
AMP	John	4	50	Jesus said to him , “ Go ; your son lives ! ” The man believed what Jesus said to him and started home .
AMP	John	4	51	As he was already going down [ the road ] , his servants met him and reported that his son was living [ and was healthy ] .
AMP	John	4	52	So he asked them at what time he began to get better . They said , “ Yesterday during the seventh hour the fever left him. ”
AMP	John	4	53	Then the father realized that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him , “ Your son lives ” ; and he and his entire household believed and confidently trusted [ in Him as Savior ] .
AMP	John	4	54	This is the second sign ( attesting miracle ) that Jesus performed [ in Cana ] after He had come from Judea to Galilee [ revealing that He is the Messiah ] .

AMP	John	5	6	When Jesus noticed him lying there [ helpless ] , knowing that he had been in that condition a long time , He said to him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
AMP	John	5	7	The invalid answered , “ Sir , I have no one to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up , and while I am coming [ to get into it myself ] , someone else steps down ahead of me. ”
AMP	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , “ Get up ; pick up your pallet and walk. ”
AMP	John	5	9	Immediately the man was healed and recovered his strength , and [ c ] picked up his pallet and walked . Now that day was the Sabbath .
AMP	John	5	10	So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath , and you are not [ d ] permitted to pick up your pallet [ because it is unlawful ] . ”
AMP	John	5	11	He answered them , “ The Man who healed me and gave me back my strength was the One who said to me , ‘ Pick up your pallet and walk. ’ ”
AMP	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the Man who told you , ‘ Pick up your pallet and walk ’ ? ”
AMP	John	5	13	Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had slipped away [ unnoticed ] since there was a crowd in that place .
AMP	John	5	14	Afterward , Jesus found him in the temple and said to him , “ See , you are well ! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you. ”
AMP	John	5	15	The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well .
AMP	John	5	16	For this reason the Jews began to persecute Jesus continually because He was doing these things on the Sabbath .
AMP	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , “ My Father has been working until now [ He has never ceased working ] , and I too am working. ” Jesus ’ Equality with God
AMP	John	5	18	This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him , for not only was He breaking the Sabbath [ from their viewpoint ] , but He was also calling God His own Father , making Himself equal with God .
AMP	John	5	19	So Jesus answered them by saying , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , the Son [ e ] can do nothing of Himself [ of His own accord ] , unless it is something He sees the Father doing ; for whatever things the Father does , the Son [ in His turn ] also does in the same way .
AMP	John	5	20	For the Father dearly loves the Son and shows Him everything that He Himself is doing ; and the Father will show Him greater works than these , so that you will be filled with wonder .
AMP	John	5	21	Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life [ and allows them to live on ] , even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes .
AMP	John	5	22	For the Father judges no one , but has given all judgment [ that is , the prerogative of judging ] to the Son [ placing it entirely into His hands ] ,
AMP	John	5	23	so that all will give honor ( reverence , homage ) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father . [ In fact ] the one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him .
AMP	John	5	24	“ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , the person who hears My word [ the one who heeds My message ] , and believes and trusts in Him who sent Me , has ( possesses now ) eternal life [ that is , eternal life actually begins—the believer is transformed ] , and does not come into judgment and condemnation , but has passed [ over ] from death into life . Two Resurrections
AMP	John	5	25	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , a time is coming and is [ here ] now , when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear it will live .
AMP	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in Himself [ and is self-existent ] , even so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself [ and be self-existent ] .
AMP	John	5	27	And He has given Him authority to execute judgment , because He is a Son of Man [ sinless humanity , qualifying Him to sit in judgment over mankind ] . ( A )
AMP	John	5	28	Do not be surprised at this ; for a time is coming when all those who are in the tombs will hear His voice ,
AMP	John	5	29	and they will come out—those who did good things [ will come out ] to a resurrection of [ new ] life , but those who did evil things [ will come out ] to a resurrection of judgment [ that is , to be sentenced ] . ( B )
AMP	John	5	30	“ I can do nothing on my own initiative or authority . Just as I hear , I judge ; and My judgment is just ( fair , righteous , unbiased ) , because I do not seek My own will , but only the will of Him who sent Me .
AMP	John	5	31	“ If I alone testify about Myself , My testimony is not [ f ] valid .
AMP	John	5	32	There is another [ My Father ] who testifies about Me , and I know [ without any doubt ] that His testimony on My behalf is true and valid . Testimony of John
AMP	John	5	33	You have sent [ an inquiry ] to [ g ] John [ the Baptist ] and he has testified [ as an eyewitness ] to the truth .
AMP	John	5	34	But the testimony I receive is not from man [ a merely human witness ] ; but I say these things so that you may be saved [ that is , have eternal life ] .
AMP	John	5	35	John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [ to show you the way ] , and you were willing for a while to rejoice in his light . ( C ) Testimony of Works
AMP	John	5	36	But the testimony which I have is far greater than the testimony of John ; for the works that the Father has given Me to finish—the very same works [ that is , the miracles and proofs of My deity ] that I am [ now ] doing—testify about Me , [ by providing evidence ] that the Father has sent Me . Testimony of the Father
AMP	John	5	37	And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me . You have never heard His voice nor seen His form [ His majesty and greatness—what He is like ] .
AMP	John	5	38	You do not have His word ( Scripture ) abiding in you [ actually living in your hearts and minds ] , because you do not believe in Him whom He has sent . Testimony of the Scripture
AMP	John	5	39	[ h ] You search and keep on searching and examining the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and yet it is those [ very Scriptures ] that testify about Me ;
AMP	John	5	40	and still you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life .
AMP	John	5	41	I do not receive glory and approval from men ;
AMP	John	5	42	but I know you and recognize that you do not have the love of God in yourselves .
AMP	John	5	43	I have come in My Father ’ s name and with His power , and you do not receive Me [ because your minds are closed ] ; but if another comes in his own name and with no authority or power except his own , you will receive him and give your approval to an imposter .
AMP	John	5	44	How can you believe [ in Me ] , when you [ seek and ] receive glory and approval from one another , and yet you do not seek the glory and approval which comes from the one and only God ?
AMP	John	5	45	Do not think that I [ am the One who ] will accuse you before the Father . There [ already ] is one who accuses you : Moses , [ the very one ] in whom you have placed your hope [ for salvation ] .
AMP	John	5	46	For if you believed and relied on [ the Scriptures written by ] Moses , you would believe Me , for he wrote about Me [ personally ] . ( D )

AMP	John	6	2	A large crowd was following Him because they had seen the signs ( attesting miracles ) which He continually performed on those who were sick .
AMP	John	6	3	And Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down there with His disciples .
AMP	John	6	4	Now the Passover , the feast of the Jews , was approaching . ( B )
AMP	John	6	5	Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward Him , and He said to Philip , “ Where will we buy bread for these people to eat ? ”

AMP	John	6	15	Then Jesus , knowing that they were going to come and take Him by force to make Him king , withdrew again to the mountainside by Himself .
AMP	John	6	16	When evening came , His disciples went down to the sea ,
AMP	John	6	17	and they got into a boat and started to cross the sea to Capernaum . It was already dark , and Jesus had still not come [ back ] to them .
AMP	John	6	18	The sea was getting rough and rising high because a strong wind was blowing .
AMP	John	6	19	Then , when they had rowed [ c ] three or four miles [ and were near the [ d ] center of the sea ] , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat ; and they were [ terribly ] frightened .
AMP	John	6	20	But Jesus said to them , “ It is I ( I Am ) ; do not be afraid. ” ( D )
AMP	John	6	21	Then they were willing to take Him on board the boat , and immediately the boat reached the [ shore of the ] land to which they were going .
AMP	John	6	22	The next day the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea realized that there had been only one small boat there , and that Jesus had not boarded the boat with His disciples , but that His disciples had gone away alone .
AMP	John	6	23	[ Now some ] other small boats from [ e ] Tiberias had come in near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
AMP	John	6	24	So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there , they boarded the small boats themselves and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
AMP	John	6	25	or
AMP	John	6	26	Jesus answered , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , you have been searching for Me , not because you saw the signs ( attesting miracles ) , but because you ate the loaves and were filled .
AMP	John	6	27	Do not work for food that perishes , but for food that endures [ and leads ] to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give you ; for God the Father has authorized Him and put His seal on Him. ”
AMP	John	6	28	Then they asked Him , “ What are we to do , so that we may habitually be doing the works of God ? ”

AMP	John	6	42	They kept saying , “ Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How does He now [ have the arrogance to ] say , ‘ I have come down out of heaven ’ ? ”
AMP	John	6	43	So Jesus answered , “ Stop murmuring among yourselves .
AMP	John	6	44	No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him [ giving him the desire to come to Me ] ; and I will raise him up [ from the dead ] on the last day .

AMP	John	6	52	Then the Jews began to argue with one another , saying , “ How can this man give us His flesh to eat ? ”
AMP	John	6	53	And Jesus said to them , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood [ unless you believe in Me as Savior and believe in the saving power of My blood which will be shed for you ] , you do not have life in yourselves .
AMP	John	6	54	The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood [ believes in Me , accepts Me as Savior ] has eternal life [ that is , now possesses it ] , and I will raise him up [ from the dead ] on the last day .

AMP	John	6	61	But Jesus , aware that His disciples were complaining about it , asked them , “ Does this cause you to stumble and take offense ?
AMP	John	6	62	What then [ will you think ] if you see the Son of Man ascending to [ the realm ] where He was before ?

AMP	John	7	2	Now the Jewish [ a ] Feast of Tabernacles ( Booths ) was approaching .
AMP	John	7	3	So His [ b ] brothers said to Him , “ Leave here and go to Judea , so that Your disciples [ there ] may also see the works that You do .
AMP	John	7	4	No one does anything in secret when he wants to be known publicly . If You [ must ] do these things , show Yourself openly to the world and make Yourself known ! ”
AMP	John	7	5	For not even His brothers believed in Him .
AMP	John	7	6	So Jesus said to them , “ My time has not yet come ; but any time is right for you .
AMP	John	7	8	Go up to the feast yourselves . I am not going up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come. ”
AMP	John	7	9	Having said these things to them , He stayed behind in Galilee .
AMP	John	7	10	But [ afterward ] , when His brothers had gone up to the feast , He went up too , not publicly [ with a caravan ] , but quietly [ because He did not want to be noticed ] .
AMP	John	7	11	So the Jews kept looking for Him at the feast and asking , “ Where is He ? ”
AMP	John	7	12	There was a lot of whispered discussion and murmuring among the crowds about Him . Some were saying , “ He is a good man ” ; others said , “ No , on the contrary , He misleads the people [ giving them false ideas ] . ”
AMP	John	7	13	Yet no one was speaking out openly and freely about Him for fear of [ the leaders of ] the Jews .
AMP	John	7	14	When the feast was already half over , Jesus went up into the temple [ court ] and began to teach .
AMP	John	7	15	Then the Jews were perplexed . They said , “ How [ c ] did this man become learned [ so versed in the Scriptures and theology ] [ d ] without formal training ? ”
AMP	John	7	16	Jesus answered them by saying , “ My teaching is not My own , but His who sent Me .
AMP	John	7	17	If anyone is willing to do His will , he will know whether the teaching is of God or whether I speak on My own accord and by My own authority .
AMP	John	7	18	He who speaks on his own accord seeks glory and honor for himself . But He who seeks the glory and the honor of the One who sent Him , He is true , and there is no unrighteousness or deception in Him .
AMP	John	7	19	“ Did not Moses give you the Law ? And yet not one of you keeps the Law . Why do you want to kill Me [ for not keeping it ] ? ”
AMP	John	7	20	The crowd answered , “ You have a demon [ You are out of Your mind ] ! Who wants to kill You ? ”
AMP	John	7	21	Jesus replied , “ I did one [ e ] work , and you are all astounded . ( A )
AMP	John	7	22	For this reason Moses has given you [ God ’ s law regarding ] circumcision ( not that it originated with Moses , but with the patriarchs ) and you circumcise a man [ even ] on the Sabbath .
AMP	John	7	23	If , to avoid breaking the Law of Moses , a man undergoes [ f ] circumcision on the Sabbath , why are you angry with Me for making a man ’ s whole body well on the Sabbath ?
AMP	John	7	24	Do not judge by appearance [ superficially and arrogantly ] , but judge fairly and righteously. ”
AMP	John	7	25	Then some of the people of Jerusalem said , “ Is this not the Man they want to kill ?
AMP	John	7	26	Look , He is speaking publicly , and they say nothing to Him ! Is it possible that the rulers really know that this is the Christ ?
AMP	John	7	27	But we know where this Man is from ; whenever the Christ comes , no one will know where He is from. ”
AMP	John	7	28	Then Jesus called out as He taught in the temple , “ You know Me and know where I am from ; and I have not come on my own initiative [ as self-appointed ] , but He who sent Me is true , and Him you do not know .
AMP	John	7	29	I know Him Myself because I am from Him [ I came from His very presence ] and it was He [ personally ] who sent Me. ”
AMP	John	7	30	So they were eager to arrest Him ; but no one laid a hand on Him , because His time had not yet come .
AMP	John	7	31	But many from the crowd believed in Him . And they kept saying , “ When the Christ comes , will He do more signs and exhibit more proofs than this Man ? ”
AMP	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things [ under their breath ] about Him , and the chief priests and Pharisees sent [ g ] guards to arrest Him .
AMP	John	7	33	Therefore Jesus said , “ For a little while longer I am [ still ] with you , and then I go to Him who sent Me .
AMP	John	7	34	You will look for Me , and will not [ be able to ] find Me ; and where I am , you can not come. ”
AMP	John	7	35	Then the Jews said among themselves , “ Where does this Man intend to go that we will not find Him ? Does He intend to go to the Dispersion [ of Jews scattered and living ] among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
AMP	John	7	36	What does this statement of His mean , ‘ You will look for Me , and will not [ be able to ] find Me ; and where I am , you can not come ’ ? ”
AMP	John	7	37	Now on the last and most important day of the feast , Jesus stood and called out [ in a loud voice ] , “ If anyone is thirsty , let him come to Me and drink !
AMP	John	7	38	He who believes in Me [ who adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Me ] , as the Scripture has said , ‘ From his innermost being will flow continually rivers of living water. ’ ” ( B )
AMP	John	7	39	But He was speaking of the [ Holy ] Spirit , whom those who believed in Him [ as Savior ] were to receive afterward . The Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus was not yet glorified ( raised to honor ) . Division of People over Jesus
AMP	John	7	40	Listening to these words , some of the people said , “ This is certainly the Prophet ! ” ( C )
AMP	John	7	41	Others said , “ This is the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) ! ” But others said , “ Surely the Christ is not going to come out of Galilee , is He ?
AMP	John	7	42	Does the Scripture not say that the Christ comes from the descendants of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David lived ? ” ( D )
AMP	John	7	43	So the crowd was divided because of Him .
AMP	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to arrest Him , but no one laid hands on Him .
AMP	John	7	45	Then the guards went [ back ] to the chief priests and Pharisees , who asked them , “ Why did you not bring Him [ here with you ] ? ”
AMP	John	7	46	The guards replied , “ Never [ at any time ] has a man talked the way this Man talks ! ”
AMP	John	7	47	Then the Pharisees said to them , “ Have you also been deluded and swept off your feet ?
AMP	John	7	48	Has any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him ?
AMP	John	7	49	But this [ ignorant , contemptible ] crowd that does not know the Law is accursed and doomed ! ”

AMP	John	8	8	Then He stooped down again and started writing on the ground .
AMP	John	8	2	Early in the morning He came back into the temple [ court ] , and all the people were coming to Him . He sat down and began teaching them .
AMP	John	8	3	Now the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery . They made her stand in the center of the court ,
AMP	John	8	4	and they said to Him , “ Teacher , this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery .

AMP	John	8	6	They said this to test Him , hoping that they would have grounds for accusing Him . But Jesus stooped down and began writing on the ground with His finger .

AMP	John	8	12	Once more Jesus addressed the crowd . He said , “ [ a ] I am the Light of the world . He who follows Me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the Light of life. ”
AMP	John	8	13	Then the Pharisees told Him , “ You are testifying on Your own behalf ; Your testimony is not valid. ”
AMP	John	8	14	Jesus replied , “ Even if I do testify on My own behalf , My testimony is valid , because I know where I came from and where I am going ; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going .
AMP	John	8	15	You judge according to [ b ] human standards [ just by what you see ] . I do not judge anyone .
AMP	John	8	16	But even if I do judge , My judgment is true and My decision is right ; for I am not alone [ in making it ] , but I and the Father who sent Me [ make the same judgment ] .
AMP	John	8	17	Even in your own law it is written that the testimony of two persons is true [ valid and admissible ] . ( C )
AMP	John	8	18	I am One [ of the Two ] who testifies about Myself , and My Father who sent Me testifies about Me. ”
AMP	John	8	19	Then the Pharisees said to Him , “ Where is this Father of Yours ? ” Jesus answered , “ You know neither Me nor My Father ; if you knew Me , you would know My Father also. ”
AMP	John	8	20	Jesus said these things in the treasury , as He taught in the temple [ courtyard ] ; and no one seized Him , because His time had not yet come .
AMP	John	8	21	Then He said again to them , “ I am going away , and you will look for Me , and you will die [ unforgiven and condemned ] in your sin . Where I am going , you can not come. ”
AMP	John	8	22	So the Jews were asking [ among themselves ] , “ Will He kill Himself ? Is that why He says , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come ’ ? ”
AMP	John	8	23	He said to them , “ You are from below , I am from above ; you are of this world , I am not of this world .
AMP	John	8	24	That is why I told you that you will die [ unforgiven and condemned ] in your sins ; for if you do not believe that I am the One [ I claim to be ] , you will die in your sins. ” ( D )
AMP	John	8	25	So they said to Him , “ Who are You [ anyway ] ? ” Jesus replied , “ What have I been saying to you from the beginning ?
AMP	John	8	26	I have many things to say and judge concerning you , but He who sent Me is true ; and I say to the world [ only ] the things that I have heard from Him. ”
AMP	John	8	27	They did not realize [ or have the spiritual insight to understand ] that He was speaking to them about the Father .
AMP	John	8	28	So Jesus said , “ When you lift up the Son of Man [ on the cross ] , you will know then [ without any doubt ] that I am He , and that I do nothing on My own authority , but I say these things just as My Father taught Me .
AMP	John	8	29	And He who sent Me is [ always ] with Me ; He has not left Me alone , because I always do what pleases Him. ”
AMP	John	8	30	As He said these things , [ c ] many believed in Him . The Truth Will Make You Free
AMP	John	8	31	So Jesus was saying to the Jews who had believed Him , “ If you abide in My word [ continually obeying My teachings and living in accordance with them , then ] you are truly My disciples .
AMP	John	8	32	And you will know the truth [ regarding salvation ] , and the truth will set you free [ from the penalty of sin ] . ”
AMP	John	8	33	They answered Him , “ We are Abraham ’ s descendants and have never been enslaved to anyone . [ d ] What do You mean by saying , ‘ You will be set free ’ ? ”
AMP	John	8	34	Jesus answered , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , everyone who practices sin habitually is a slave of sin .
AMP	John	8	35	Now the slave does not remain in a household forever ; the son [ of the master ] does remain forever .
AMP	John	8	36	So if the Son makes you free , then you are unquestionably free .
AMP	John	8	37	I know that you are Abraham ’ s descendants ; yet you plan to kill Me , because My word has no place [ to grow ] in you [ and it makes no change in your heart ] .
AMP	John	8	38	I tell the things that I have seen at My Father ’ s side [ in His very presence ] ; so you also do the things that you heard from your father. ”
AMP	John	8	39	They answered , “ Abraham is our father. ” Jesus said to them , “ If you are [ truly ] Abraham ’ s children , then do the works of Abraham and follow his example .
AMP	John	8	40	But as it is , you want to kill Me , a Man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . This is not the way Abraham acted .
AMP	John	8	41	You are doing the works of your [ own ] father. ” They said to Him , “ We are not illegitimate children ; we have one [ spiritual ] Father : God. ”
AMP	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your Father [ but He is not ] , you would love and recognize Me , for I came from God [ out of His very presence ] and have arrived here . For I have not even come on My own initiative [ as self-appointed ] , but He [ is the One who ] sent Me .
AMP	John	8	43	Why do you misunderstand what I am saying ? It is because [ your spiritual ears are deaf and ] you are unable to hear [ the truth of ] My word .
AMP	John	8	44	You are of your father the devil , and it is your will to practice the desires [ which are characteristic ] of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks what is natural to him , for he is a liar and the father of lies and half-truths .
AMP	John	8	45	But because I speak the truth , you do not believe Me [ and continue in your unbelief ] .
AMP	John	8	46	Which one of you [ has proof and ] convicts Me of sin ? If I speak truth , why do you not believe Me ?
AMP	John	8	47	Whoever is of God and belongs to Him hears [ the truth of ] God ’ s words ; for this reason you do not hear them : because you are not of God and you are not in fellowship with Him. ”
AMP	John	8	48	The Jews answered Him , “ Are we not right when we say You are a [ e ] Samaritan and [ that You ] have a demon [ and are under its power ] ? ”
AMP	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I do not have a demon . On the contrary , I honor My Father , and you dishonor Me .
AMP	John	8	50	However , I am not seeking glory for Myself . There is One who seeks [ glory for Me ] and judges [ those who dishonor Me ] .
AMP	John	8	51	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , if anyone keeps My word [ by living in accordance with My message ] he will indeed never , ever see and experience [ f ] death. ”
AMP	John	8	52	The Jews said to Him , “ Now we know that You have a demon [ and are under its power ] . Abraham died , and also the prophets ; yet You say , ‘ If anyone keeps My word , he will never , ever taste of death. ’
AMP	John	8	53	Are You greater than our father Abraham , who died ? The prophets died too ! Whom do You make Yourself out to be ? ”
AMP	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I glorify Myself , My glory is [ worth ] nothing . It is My Father who glorifies Me , of whom you say , ‘ He is our God. ’
AMP	John	8	55	Yet you do not know Him , but I know Him fully . If I said I did not know Him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know Him and keep His word .
AMP	John	8	56	Your father Abraham [ greatly ] rejoiced to see My day ( My incarnation ) . [ g ] He saw it and was delighted. ” ( E )

AMP	John	8	58	Jesus replied , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , before Abraham was born , [ h ] I Am. ” ( F )

AMP	John	9	14	Now it was on a Sabbath day that Jesus made the mud and opened the man ’ s eyes .
AMP	John	9	15	So the Pharisees asked him again how he received his sight . And he said to them , “ He smeared mud on my eyes , and I washed , and now I see. ”
AMP	John	9	16	Then some of the Pharisees said , “ This Man [ Jesus ] is not from God , because He does not keep the Sabbath. ” But others said , “ How can a man who is a sinner ( a non-observant Jew ) do such signs and miracles ? ” So there was a difference of opinion among them .
AMP	John	9	17	Accordingly they said to the blind man again , “ What do you say about Him , since He opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ [ It must be that ] He is a [ c ] prophet ! ”
AMP	John	9	18	However , the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the man ’ s parents .
AMP	John	9	19	They asked them , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
AMP	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ;
AMP	John	9	21	but as to how he now sees , we do not know ; or who has opened his eyes , we do not know . Ask him [ and stop asking us ] ; [ d ] he is of age , he will speak for himself and give his own account of it. ”
AMP	John	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of [ the leaders of ] the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged Jesus to be the Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue ( excommunicated ) .
AMP	John	9	23	Because of this his parents said , “ He is of age ; ask him. ”
AMP	John	9	24	So a second time they called the man who had been [ born ] blind , and said to him , “ Give God glory and praise [ for your sight ] ! We know this Man [ Jesus ] is a sinner [ separated from God ] . ”
AMP	John	9	25	Then he answered , “ I do not know whether He is a sinner [ separated from God ] ; but one thing I do know , that though I was blind , now I see. ”
AMP	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did He [ actually ] do to you ? How did He open your eyes ? ”
AMP	John	9	27	He answered , “ I already told you and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again and again ? Do you want to become His disciples , too ? ”
AMP	John	9	28	And [ at that remark ] they stormed at him and jeered , “ You are His disciple , but we are disciples of Moses !
AMP	John	9	29	We know [ for certain ] that God has spoken to Moses , but as for this Man , we do not know where He is from. ”

AMP	John	9	32	Since the [ e ] beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind .
AMP	John	9	33	If this Man were not from God , He would not be able to do anything [ like this because God would not hear His prayer ] . ”

AMP	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had [ g ] put him out [ of the synagogue ] , and finding him , He asked , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
AMP	John	9	36	He answered , “ Who is He , Sir ? Tell me so that I may believe in Him. ”
AMP	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have both seen Him , and [ in fact ] He is the one who is talking with you. ”

AMP	John	10	10	The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy . I came that they may have and enjoy life , and have it in abundance [ to the full , till it overflows ] .
AMP	John	10	2	But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep [ the protector and provider ] .
AMP	John	10	3	The [ a ] doorkeeper opens [ the gate ] for this man , and the sheep hear his voice and pay attention to it . And [ knowing that they listen ] he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out [ to pasture ] .
AMP	John	10	4	When he has brought all his own sheep outside , he walks on ahead of them , and the sheep follow him because they know his voice and recognize his call .
AMP	John	10	5	They will never follow a stranger , but will run away from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers. ”
AMP	John	10	6	Jesus used this figure of speech with them , but they did not understand what He was talking about .
AMP	John	10	7	So Jesus said again , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , I am [ b ] the Door for the sheep [ leading to life ] .
AMP	John	10	8	All who came before Me [ as false messiahs and self-appointed leaders ] are thieves and robbers , but the [ true ] sheep did not hear them .
AMP	John	10	9	I am the Door ; anyone who enters through Me will be saved [ and will live forever ] , and will go in and out [ freely ] , and find pasture ( spiritual security ) .
AMP	John	10	11	[ c ] I am the Good Shepherd . The Good Shepherd [ d ] lays down His [ own ] life for the sheep . ( A )
AMP	John	10	12	But the hired man [ who merely serves for wages ] , who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep , when he sees the wolf coming , deserts the flock and runs away ; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them .
AMP	John	10	13	The man runs because he is a hired hand [ who serves only for wages ] and is not concerned about the [ safety of the ] sheep .
AMP	John	10	14	I am the Good Shepherd , and I know [ without any doubt those who are ] My own and My own know Me [ and have a deep , personal relationship with Me ] —
AMP	John	10	15	even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father—and I lay down My [ very own ] life [ sacrificing it ] for the benefit of the sheep .
AMP	John	10	16	I have [ e ] other sheep [ beside these ] that are not of this fold . I must bring those also , and they will listen to My voice and pay attention to My call , and they will become [ f ] one flock with one Shepherd . ( B )
AMP	John	10	17	For this reason the Father loves Me , because I lay down My [ own ] life so that I may take it back .
AMP	John	10	18	No one takes it away from Me , but I lay it down voluntarily . I am authorized and have power to lay it down and to give it up , and I am authorized and have power to take it back . This command I have received from My Father. ”
AMP	John	10	19	A division [ of opinion ] occurred again among the Jews because of these words [ of His ] .
AMP	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ He has a demon and He is mad [ insane—He raves and rambles ] . Why listen to Him ? ”
AMP	John	10	21	Others were saying , “ These are not the words and thoughts of one possessed by a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ” Jesus Asserts His Deity
AMP	John	10	22	At that time the [ g ] Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem .
AMP	John	10	23	It was winter , and Jesus was walking in the temple [ area ] in [ h ] Solomon ’ s portico .
AMP	John	10	24	So the Jews surrounded Him and began saying to Him , “ How long are You going to keep us in suspense ? If You are [ really ] the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , tell us so plainly and openly. ”
AMP	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I have told you so , yet you do not believe . The works that I do in My Father ’ s name testify concerning Me [ they are My credentials and the evidence declaring who I am ] .
AMP	John	10	26	But you do not believe Me [ so you do not trust and follow Me ] because you are not My sheep .
AMP	John	10	27	The sheep that are My own hear My voice and listen to Me ; I know them , and they follow Me .
AMP	John	10	28	And I give them eternal life , and they will never , ever [ by any means ] perish ; and no one will ever snatch them out of My hand .
AMP	John	10	29	[ i ] My Father , who has given them to Me , is greater and mightier than all ; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father ’ s hand .
AMP	John	10	30	I and the Father are One [ in essence and nature ] . ”
AMP	John	10	31	Again the Jews picked up stones to stone Him .
AMP	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , “ I showed you many good works [ and many acts of mercy ] from the Father ; for which of them are you stoning Me ? ”
AMP	John	10	33	The Jews answered Him , “ We are not going to stone You for a good work , but for blasphemy , because You , a mere man , make Yourself out to be God. ”
AMP	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Is it not written in your Law , ‘ I said , you are gods [ human judges representing God , not divine beings ] ’ ? ( C )
AMP	John	10	35	If He [ j ] called them gods , men to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can not be undone or annulled or broken ) ,

AMP	John	10	40	He went back again across the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing , and He was staying there .

AMP	John	11	11	He said this , and after that said , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep ; but I am going there to wake him. ”
AMP	John	11	2	It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . ( A )
AMP	John	11	3	So the sisters sent word to Him , saying , “ Lord , he [ our brother and Your friend ] whom You love is sick. ”
AMP	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this , He said , “ This sickness will not end in death ; but [ on the contrary it is ] for the glory and honor of God , so that the Son of God may be glorified by it. ”
AMP	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved and was concerned about Martha and her sister and Lazarus [ and considered them dear friends ] .
AMP	John	11	6	[ b ] So [ even ] when He heard that Lazarus was sick , He stayed in the same place two more days .
AMP	John	11	7	Then He said to His disciples , “ Let us go back to Judea. ”
AMP	John	11	8	The disciples said to Him , “ Rabbi ( Teacher ) , the Jews were only recently going to stone You , and You are [ thinking of ] going back there again ? ”
AMP	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours [ of light ] in the day ? Anyone who walks in the daytime does not stumble , because he sees [ by ] the light of this world .
AMP	John	11	10	But if anyone walks in the night , he stumbles , because there is no light in him. ”
AMP	John	11	12	The disciples answered , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover. ”
AMP	John	11	13	However , Jesus had spoken of his death , but they thought that He was referring to natural sleep .
AMP	John	11	14	So then Jesus told them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
AMP	John	11	15	And for your sake I am glad that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him. ”
AMP	John	11	16	Then Thomas , who was called Didymus ( the twin ) , said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us go too , that we may die with Him. ”
AMP	John	11	17	So when Jesus arrived , He found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb [ c ] four days .
AMP	John	11	18	Bethany was near Jerusalem , about two miles away ;
AMP	John	11	19	and many of the Jews had come to see Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning [ the loss of ] their brother .
AMP	John	11	20	So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet Him , while Mary remained sitting in the house .
AMP	John	11	21	Then Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died .
AMP	John	11	22	Even now I know that whatever You ask of God , God will give to You. ”
AMP	John	11	23	Jesus told her , “ Your brother will rise [ from the dead ] . ”
AMP	John	11	24	Martha replied , “ I know that he will rise [ from the dead ] in the resurrection on the last day. ”
AMP	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ [ d ] I am the Resurrection and the Life . Whoever believes in ( adheres to , trusts in , relies on ) Me [ as Savior ] will live even if he dies ;
AMP	John	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in Me [ as Savior ] will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
AMP	John	11	27	She said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; I have believed and continue to believe that You are the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , the Son of God , [ e ] He who was [ destined and promised ] to come into the world [ and it is for You that the world has waited ] . ”
AMP	John	11	28	After she had said this , she left and called her sister Mary , privately whispering [ to her ] , “ The Teacher is here and is asking for you. ”
AMP	John	11	29	And when she heard this , she got up quickly and went to Him .
AMP	John	11	30	Now Jesus had not yet entered the village , but was still at the place where Martha had met Him .
AMP	John	11	31	So when the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her , saw how quickly Mary got up and left , they followed her , assuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
AMP	John	11	32	When Mary came [ to the place ] where Jesus was and saw Him , she fell at His feet , saying to Him , “ Lord , if You had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
AMP	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her sobbing , and the Jews who had come with her also sobbing , He was [ f ] deeply moved in spirit [ to the point of anger at the sorrow caused by death ] and was troubled ,
AMP	John	11	34	and said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said , “ Lord , come and see. ”
AMP	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
AMP	John	11	36	So the Jews were saying , “ See how He loved him [ as a close friend ] ! ”
AMP	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Could not this Man , who opened the blind man ’ s eyes , have kept this man from dying ? ”
AMP	John	11	38	So Jesus , again deeply moved within [ to the point of anger ] , approached the tomb . It was a cave , and a boulder was lying against it [ to cover the entrance ] .
AMP	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone. ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said to Him , “ Lord , by this time there will be an offensive odor , for he has been dead four days ! [ It is hopeless ! ] ”
AMP	John	11	40	Jesus said to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you believe [ in Me ] , you will see the glory of God [ the expression of His excellence ] ? ”
AMP	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus raised His eyes [ toward heaven ] and said , “ Father , I thank You that You have heard Me .
AMP	John	11	42	I knew that You always hear Me and listen to Me ; but I have said this because of the people standing around , so that they may believe that You have sent Me [ and that You have made Me Your representative ] . ”
AMP	John	11	43	When He had said this , He shouted with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
AMP	John	11	44	Out came the man who had been dead , his hands and feet tightly wrapped in burial cloths ( linen strips ) , and with a [ burial ] cloth wrapped around his face . Jesus said to them , “ Unwrap him and release him. ”
AMP	John	11	45	So then , many of the Jews who had come to [ be with ] Mary and who were eyewitnesses to what Jesus had done , believed in Him .
AMP	John	11	46	But some of them went back to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done . Conspiracy to Kill Jesus
AMP	John	11	47	So the chief priests and Pharisees convened a council [ of the leaders in Israel ] , and said , “ What are we doing ? For this man performs many signs ( attesting miracles ) .
AMP	John	11	48	If we let Him go on like this , everyone will believe in Him , and the Romans will come and take away both our [ holy ] place ( the temple ) and our nation. ”
AMP	John	11	49	But one of them , [ g ] Caiaphas , who was the high priest that year [ the year of Christ ’ s crucifixion ] , said to them , “ You know nothing at all !
AMP	John	11	50	Nor do you understand that it is expedient and politically advantageous for you that one man die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish. ”
AMP	John	11	51	Now he did not say this [ simply ] on his own initiative ; but being the high priest that year , he [ was unknowingly used by God and ] prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation , ( B )
AMP	John	11	52	and not only for the nation , but also for the purpose of gathering together into one body the children of God who have been scattered abroad . ( C )
AMP	John	11	53	So from that day on they planned together to kill Him .
AMP	John	11	54	For that reason Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews , but left there and went to the district that borders on the uninhabited wilderness , to a town called Ephraim ; and He stayed there with the disciples .
AMP	John	11	55	Now the Passover of the Jews was approaching , and many from the country went up to Jerusalem before Passover to purify themselves [ ceremonially , so that they would be able to participate in the feast ] .
AMP	John	11	56	So they were looking for Jesus as they stood in the temple [ area ] , and saying among themselves , “ What do you think ? Will He not come to the feast at all ? ”
AMP	John	11	57	Now the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was , he was to report it so that they might arrest Him . Footnotes - John 11:1 Two cities named Bethany are mentioned in the NT . This one is located on the east side of the Mount of Olives , about two miles from Jerusalem , on the road to Jericho ; the other city is “ Bethany across the Jordan ” ( 1:28 ) in Perea . - John 11:6 The delay by Jesus was to assure everyone that Lazarus was truly dead , as the context which follows makes clear . - John 11:17 Jesus purposefully stayed away for four days after Lazarus ’ death .

AMP	John	12	12	The next day , when the large crowd who had come to the Passover feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , ( B )
AMP	John	12	2	So they gave a supper for Him there . Martha was serving , and Lazarus was one of those reclining at the table with Him .
AMP	John	12	3	Then [ a ] Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume of pure [ b ] nard , and she poured it on Jesus ’ feet and wiped His feet with her hair ; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume .
AMP	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot , one of His disciples , the one who was going to betray Him , said ,
AMP	John	12	5	“ Why was this perfume not sold for [ c ] three hundred denarii and [ the money ] given to the poor ? ”
AMP	John	12	6	Now he said this , not because he cared about the poor [ for he had never cared about them ] , but because he was a thief ; and since he had the money box [ serving as treasurer for the twelve disciples ] , he used to pilfer what was put into it .
AMP	John	12	7	So Jesus said , “ Let her alone , so that she may keep [ the rest of ] it for the day of My burial .
AMP	John	12	8	You always have the poor with you , but you do not always have Me. ”
AMP	John	12	9	A large crowd of Jews learned that He was there [ at Bethany ] ; and they came , not only because of Jesus , but also to see Lazarus , whom He had raised from the dead .
AMP	John	12	10	So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus also ,
AMP	John	12	11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going away [ from the teaching and traditions of the Jewish leaders ] and believing in Jesus [ following Him as Savior and Messiah ] . The Triumphal Entry
AMP	John	12	13	they took branches of palm trees [ in homage to Him as King ] and went out to meet Him , and they began shouting and kept shouting “ Hosanna ! Blessed ( celebrated , praised ) is He who comes in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel ! ” ( C )
AMP	John	12	14	And Jesus , finding a young donkey , sat on it ; just as it is written [ in Scripture ] ,
AMP	John	12	15	“ Do not fear , Daughter of Zion ; Behold , Your King is coming , seated on a donkey ’ s colt. ” ( D )
AMP	John	12	16	His disciples did not understand [ the meaning of ] these things at first ; but when Jesus was glorified and exalted , they remembered that these things had been written about Him and had been done to Him .
AMP	John	12	17	So the people , who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead , continued to tell others about Him .
AMP	John	12	18	For this reason the crowd went to meet Him , because they heard that He had performed this [ miraculous ] sign .
AMP	John	12	19	Then the Pharisees [ argued and ] said to one another , “ You see that your efforts are futile . Look ! The whole world has gone [ running ] after Him ! ” Greeks Seek Jesus
AMP	John	12	20	Now there were some Greeks ( Gentiles ) among those who were going up to worship at the feast ;
AMP	John	12	21	these came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , with a request , saying , “ Sir , we wish to see Jesus. ”
AMP	John	12	22	Philip came and told Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus .
AMP	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , “ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified and exalted .
AMP	John	12	24	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains alone [ just one grain , never more ] . But if it dies , it produces much grain and yields a harvest .
AMP	John	12	25	The one who loves his life [ eventually ] loses it [ through death ] , but the one who hates his life in this world [ and is concerned with pleasing God ] will keep it for life eternal .
AMP	John	12	26	If anyone serves Me , he must [ continue to faithfully ] follow Me [ without hesitation , holding steadfastly to Me , conforming to My example in living and , if need be , suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in Me ] ; and wherever I am [ in heaven ’ s glory ] , there will My servant be also . If anyone serves Me , the Father will honor him . Jesus Foretells His Death
AMP	John	12	27	“ Now My soul is troubled and deeply distressed ; what shall I say ? ‘ Father , save Me from this hour [ of trial and agony ] ’ ? But it is for this [ very ] purpose that I have come to this hour [ this time and place ] .
AMP	John	12	28	[ Rather , I will say , ] ‘ Father , glorify ( honor , extol ) Your name ! ’ ” Then a [ d ] voice came from heaven saying , “ I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again. ”
AMP	John	12	29	The crowd of people who stood nearby and heard the voice said that it had thundered ; others said , “ An angel has spoken to Him ! ”
AMP	John	12	30	Jesus answered , “ This voice has come for your sake , not for mine .
AMP	John	12	31	Now judgment is upon this world [ the sentence is being passed ] . Now the ruler of this world ( Satan ) will be cast out .
AMP	John	12	32	And I , if and when I am lifted up from the earth [ on the cross ] , will draw all people to Myself [ Gentiles , as well as Jews ] . ”
AMP	John	12	33	He said this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die .
AMP	John	12	34	At this the crowd answered Him , “ [ e ] We have heard from the Law that the Christ is to remain forever ; how then can You say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this Son of Man ? ” ( E )
AMP	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them , “ The Light is among you [ only ] a little while longer . Walk while you have the Light [ keep on living by it ] , so that darkness will not overtake you . He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going [ he is drifting aimlessly ] .
AMP	John	12	36	While you have the Light , believe and trust in the Light [ have faith in it , hold on to it , rely on it ] , so that you may become sons of Light [ being filled with Light as followers of God ] . ” Jesus said these things , and then He left and hid Himself from them .

AMP	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe , for Isaiah said again ,
AMP	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes and He hardened their heart , to keep them from seeing with their eyes and understanding with their heart and being converted ; otherwise , I [ their God ] would heal them. ”
AMP	John	12	41	Isaiah said these things because he saw His glory and spoke about Him . ( G )
AMP	John	12	42	Nevertheless , even many of the leading men believed in Him [ as Savior and Messiah ] , but because of the Pharisees they would not confess it , for fear that [ if they acknowledged Him openly ] they would be put out of the synagogue ( excommunicated ) ;
AMP	John	12	43	for they loved the approval of men more than the approval of God .
AMP	John	12	44	But Jesus loudly declared , “ The one who believes and trusts in Me does not believe [ only ] in Me but [ also believes ] in Him who sent Me .
AMP	John	12	45	And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me .
AMP	John	12	46	I have come as Light into the world , so that everyone who believes and trusts in Me [ as Savior—all those who anchor their hope in Me and rely on the truth of My message ] will not continue to live in darkness .
AMP	John	12	47	If anyone hears My words and does not keep them , I do not judge him ; for I did not come to judge and condemn the world [ that is , to initiate the final judgment of the world ] , but to save the world .
AMP	John	12	48	Whoever rejects Me and refuses to accept My teachings , has one who judges him ; the very word that I spoke will judge and condemn him on the last day .
AMP	John	12	49	For I have never spoken on My own initiative or authority , but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment regarding what to say and what to speak . ( H )

AMP	John	13	3	that Jesus , knowing that the Father had put everything into His hands , and that He had come from God and was [ now ] returning to God ,
AMP	John	13	4	got up from supper , took off His [ outer ] robe , and taking a [ servant ’ s ] towel , He tied it around His waist . Jesus Washes the Disciples ’ Feet
AMP	John	13	5	Then He poured water into the basin and began washing the disciples ’ feet and wiping them with the towel which was tied around His waist .
AMP	John	13	6	When He came to Simon Peter , he said to Him , “ Lord , are You going to wash my feet ? ”
AMP	John	13	7	Jesus replied to him , “ You do not realize now what I am doing , but you will [ fully ] understand it later. ”
AMP	John	13	8	Peter said to Him , “ You will never wash my feet ! ” Jesus answered , “ Unless I wash you , you have no part with Me [ we can have nothing to do with each other ] . ”
AMP	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to Him , “ Lord , [ in that case , wash ] not only my feet , but also my hands and my head ! ”
AMP	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ Anyone who has bathed needs only to wash his feet , and is completely clean . And you [ My disciples ] are clean , but not all of you. ”
AMP	John	13	11	For He knew who was going to betray Him ; for that reason He said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
AMP	John	13	12	So when He had washed their feet and put on His [ outer ] robe and reclined at the table again , He said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done for you ?
AMP	John	13	14	So if I , the Lord and the Teacher , washed your feet , you ought to wash one another ’ s feet as well .
AMP	John	13	15	For I gave you [ this as ] an example , so that you should do [ in turn ] as I did to you .
AMP	John	13	16	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , a slave is not greater than his master , nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him .
AMP	John	13	17	If you know these things , you are blessed [ happy and favored by God ] if you put them into practice [ and faithfully do them ] .
AMP	John	13	18	I am not speaking of all of you . I know whom I have chosen ; but [ this has happened ] in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled : ‘ He who eats My bread has raised up his heel against Me [ as My enemy ] . ’ ( A )
AMP	John	13	19	From now on I am telling you [ what will happen ] before it occurs , so that when it does take place you may believe that I am He [ who I say I am—the Christ , the Anointed , the Messiah ] .
AMP	John	13	20	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , the one who receives and welcomes whomever I send receives Me ; and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me [ in that same way ] . ” Jesus Predicts His Betrayal
AMP	John	13	21	After Jesus had said these things , He was [ a ] troubled in spirit , and testified and said , “ I assure you and most solemnly say to you , one of you will betray Me and hand Me over. ”
AMP	John	13	22	The disciples began looking at one another , puzzled and disturbed as to whom He could mean .
AMP	John	13	23	[ b ] One of His disciples , whom Jesus loved ( esteemed ) , was [ c ] leaning against Jesus ’ chest .
AMP	John	13	24	So Simon Peter motioned to him ( John ) and [ quietly ] asked [ him to ask Jesus ] of whom He was speaking .
AMP	John	13	25	Then leaning back against Jesus ’ chest , he ( John ) asked Him [ privately ] , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
AMP	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ It is the one to whom I am going to give this piece [ of bread ] after I have dipped it. ” So when He had dipped the piece of bread [ into the dish ] , He gave it to Judas , son of Simon Iscariot .
AMP	John	13	27	After [ Judas had taken ] the piece of bread , Satan entered him . Then Jesus said to him , “ What you are going to do , do quickly [ without delay ] . ”
AMP	John	13	28	But no one reclining at the table knew why He said this to him .
AMP	John	13	29	Some thought that , since Judas [ as the treasurer of the group ] had the money box , Jesus was telling him , “ Buy what we need for the feast , ” or that he was to [ d ] give something to the poor .
AMP	John	13	30	After taking the piece of bread , he went out immediately ; and it was night .
AMP	John	13	31	So when Judas had left , Jesus said , “ Now is [ the time for ] the Son of Man [ to be ] glorified , and God is glorified in Him ;
AMP	John	13	32	[ e ] [ if God is glorified in Him , ] God will also glorify Him ( the Son ) in Himself , and will glorify Him at once .
AMP	John	13	33	Little children , I am with you [ only ] a little longer . You will look for Me and , as I told the Jews , so I tell you now , ‘ Where I am going , you are not able to come. ’ ( B )
AMP	John	13	34	I am giving you a new commandment , that you [ f ] love one another . Just as I have loved you , so you too are to love one another .
AMP	John	13	35	By this everyone will know that you are My disciples , if you have love and unselfish concern for one another. ”
AMP	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to Him , “ Lord , where are You going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I am going , you can not follow Me now ; but you will be able to follow later. ”
AMP	John	13	37	Peter said to Him , “ Lord , why can not I follow You now ? I will lay down my life for You ! ” ( C )
AMP	John	13	38	Jesus answered , “ Will you [ really ] lay down your life for Me ? I assure you and most solemnly say to you , before a rooster crows you will deny and completely disown Me three times .

AMP	John	18	3	So Judas , having obtained the Roman [ b ] cohort and some officers from the high priests and the Pharisees , came there with lanterns and torches and weapons . ( A )
AMP	John	18	4	Then Jesus , knowing all that was about to happen to Him , went to them and asked , “ Whom do you want ? ”
AMP	John	18	5	They answered Him , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ” Jesus said , “ I am He. ” And Judas , who was betraying Him , was also standing with them .
AMP	John	18	6	When Jesus said , “ I am He , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
AMP	John	18	7	Again He asked them , “ Whom do you want ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ”
AMP	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I told you that I am He ; so if you want Me , let these men go on their way. ”
AMP	John	18	9	This was to fulfill and verify the words He had spoken , “ Of those whom You have given Me , I have not lost even one. ” ( B )
AMP	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s servant , cutting off his right ear . The servant ’ s name was Malchus .
AMP	John	18	11	So Jesus said to Peter , “ Put the sword [ back ] in its sheath ! Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me ? ” Jesus before Annas and Caiaphas
AMP	John	18	12	So the cohort and their commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him ,
AMP	John	18	13	and led Him to [ c ] Annas first ; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
AMP	John	18	14	It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die on behalf of the people . ( C )
AMP	John	18	15	Simon Peter and [ d ] another disciple were following Jesus . Now that disciple was known to the high priest , so he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the [ residence of the ] high priest ;
AMP	John	18	16	but Peter was standing outside at the door . So the other disciple ( John ) , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the doorkeeper , and brought Peter inside . ( D )
AMP	John	18	17	Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter , “ You are not one of this Man ’ s disciples , are you ? ” He said , “ I am not. ”
AMP	John	18	19	Then the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and about His teaching . ( E )
AMP	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken openly to the world . I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple [ area ] , where all the Jews habitually congregate ; and I said nothing in secret .
AMP	John	18	21	Why question Me ? Question those who have heard what I said to them . They know what I said. ”
AMP	John	18	22	But when He said this , one of the officers who was standing nearby [ e ] struck Jesus [ in the face ] , saying , “ Is that how You answer the high priest ? ”
AMP	John	18	23	Jesus replied , “ If I have said anything wrong , make a formal statement about the wrong ; but if [ I spoke ] properly , why did you strike Me ? ”
AMP	John	18	24	So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter ’ s Denial of Jesus
AMP	John	18	25	Now Simon Peter was [ still ] standing and warming himself . So they said to him , “ You are not one of His disciples , are you ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not. ” ( F )
AMP	John	18	26	One of the high priest ’ s servants , a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut off , said , “ Did I not see you with Him in the garden ? ”
AMP	John	18	27	So Peter denied it again , and immediately a rooster crowed . Jesus before Pilate
AMP	John	18	28	Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium ( governor ’ s palace ) . Now it was early and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium so that they would not be [ ceremonially ] unclean , but might [ be able to ] eat [ and participate in the Feast of Unleavened Bread which began after ] the [ f ] Passover [ supper ] .
AMP	John	18	29	So Pilate came out to them and asked , “ What accusation do you bring against this Man ? ” ( G )
AMP	John	18	30	They answered , “ If He were not a criminal , we would not have handed Him over to you [ for judgment ] . ”
AMP	John	18	31	Then Pilate said to them , “ Take Him yourselves and judge Him according to your own law. ” The Jews said , “ We are not permitted to put anyone to death. ”
AMP	John	18	32	This was to fulfill the word which Jesus had spoken to indicate by what manner of death He was going to die . ( H )
AMP	John	18	33	So Pilate went into the Praetorium again , and called Jesus and asked Him , “ Are You the King of the Jews ? ”
AMP	John	18	34	Jesus replied , “ Are you saying this on your own initiative , or did others tell you about Me ? ”
AMP	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? Your own people and their chief priests have handed You over to me . What have You done [ that is worthy of death ] ? ”
AMP	John	18	36	Jesus replied , “ My kingdom is not of this world [ nor does it have its origin in this world ] . If My kingdom were of this world , My servants would be fighting [ hard ] to keep Me from being handed over to the Jews ; but as it is , My kingdom is not of this world. ”
AMP	John	18	37	So Pilate said to Him , “ Then You are a King ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say [ correctly ] that I am a King . This is why I was born , and for this I have come into the world , to testify to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth [ who is a friend of the truth and belongs to the truth ] hears and listens carefully to My voice. ” ( I )
AMP	John	18	38	Pilate said to Him [ scornfully ] , “ What is truth ? ” And when he had said this , he went out to the Jews again and told them , “ I find no guilt in Him [ no crime , no cause for an accusation ] .

AMP	John	19	2	And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head , and put a purple robe around Him ; ( A )
AMP	John	19	3	and they kept coming up to Him , saying [ mockingly ] , “ Hail , King of the Jews [ Good health ! Peace ! Long life to you , King of the Jews ] ! ” And they slapped Him in the face . ( B )

AMP	John	19	6	When the chief priests and officers saw Him , they shouted , “ Crucify [ Him ] ! Crucify [ Him ] ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Take Him yourselves and crucify Him , for I find no guilt in Him [ no crime , no cause for an accusation ] . ” ( C )
AMP	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , “ We have a law [ regarding blasphemy ] , and according to that law He should die , because He made Himself out to be the Son of God. ” ( D )

AMP	John	19	9	He went into the Praetorium again and said to Jesus , “ Where are You from ? ” But Jesus did not answer him . ( E )
AMP	John	19	10	So Pilate said to Him , “ You do not speak to me ? Do You not know that I have authority to release You , and I have authority to crucify You ? ”

AMP	John	19	13	When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called [ e ] The Pavement , but in [ f ] Hebrew , Gabbatha .
AMP	John	19	14	Now it was the day of Preparation for the [ g ] Passover [ week ] , and it was about the sixth hour . He said to the Jews , “ Look , your King ! ”
AMP	John	19	15	But they shouted , “ Away with Him , away with Him , crucify Him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your King ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no king but Caesar ! ” The Crucifixion
AMP	John	19	16	Then he handed Him over to them to be crucified .
AMP	John	19	17	So they took Jesus , and He went out , [ h ] bearing His own cross , to the place called [ i ] the Place of the Skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha . ( F )
AMP	John	19	18	There they crucified Him , and with Him two others , one on either side , and Jesus between them . ( G )
AMP	John	19	20	And many of the Jews read this inscription , for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , in Latin , and in Greek .
AMP	John	19	21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write , ‘ The King of the Jews ’ ; but , ‘ He said , “ I am King of the Jews. ” ’ ”
AMP	John	19	22	Pilate replied , “ What I have written I have written [ and it remains written ] . ”
AMP	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took His outer clothes and made four parts , a part for each soldier , and also the tunic . But the [ j ] tunic was seamless , woven [ in one piece ] from the top throughout . ( I )
AMP	John	19	24	So they said to one another , “ Let us not tear it , but cast lots for it , to decide whose it will be. ” This was to fulfill the Scripture , “ They divided My outer clothing among them , and for My clothing they cast lots. ” ( J )
AMP	John	19	25	So the soldiers did these things . But standing by the cross of Jesus were His mother , His mother ’ s sister [ [ k ] Salome ] , [ l ] Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene . ( K )
AMP	John	19	26	So Jesus , seeing His mother , and the [ m ] disciple whom He loved ( esteemed ) standing near , said to His mother , “ [ Dear ] woman , look , [ here is ] your son ! ”
AMP	John	19	27	Then He said to the disciple ( John ) , “ Look ! [ here is ] your mother [ protect and provide for her ] ! ” From that hour the disciple took her into his own home .
AMP	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , knowing that all was now finished , said in fulfillment of the Scripture , “ I am thirsty. ” ( L )
AMP	John	19	29	A jar full of [ n ] sour wine was placed there ; so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on [ a branch of ] hyssop and held it to His mouth . ( M )
AMP	John	19	30	When Jesus had received the sour wine , He said , “ It is finished ! ” And He bowed His head and [ voluntarily ] [ o ] gave up His spirit . Care of the Body of Jesus
AMP	John	19	31	Since it was the day of Preparation [ for the Sabbath ] , in order to prevent the bodies from hanging on the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was a high holy day ) the Jews asked Pilate to have their legs [ p ] broken [ to hasten death ] and the bodies taken away .
AMP	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man , and of the other who had been crucified with Him .
AMP	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead , they did not break His legs .
AMP	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear , and immediately blood and water came [ flowing ] out .
AMP	John	19	35	And he ( John , the eyewitness ) who has seen it has testified , and his testimony is true ; and he knows that he is telling the truth , so that you also [ who read this ] may believe .
AMP	John	19	36	For these things took place to fulfill the Scripture , “ Not a bone of His shall be broken. ” ( N )
AMP	John	19	37	And again another Scripture says , “ They shall look at Him whom they have pierced. ” ( O )
AMP	John	19	38	And after this , Joseph of Arimathea—a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews—asked Pilate to let him take away the body of Jesus ; and Pilate gave him permission . So he came and took away His body . ( P )
AMP	John	19	39	Nicodemus , who had first come to Him at night , also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , [ weighing ] about a hundred [ Roman ] [ q ] pounds .
AMP	John	19	40	So they took Jesus ’ body and bound it in linen wrappings with the fragrant spices , as is the burial custom of the Jews .
AMP	John	19	41	Now there was a garden at the place where He was crucified , and in the garden a new tomb [ cut out of solid rock ] in which no one had yet been laid .
AMP	John	19	42	Therefore , because of the Jewish day of Preparation , and since the tomb was nearby , they laid Jesus there .

Men frequently died of the scourging . - John 19:8 As a Roman pagan , Pilate would have been superstitious and may have feared that Jesus actually had some sort of magical or divine power . - John 19:11 This may refer to Judas Iscariot , but Caiaphas may be the more likely one since he was directly responsible for Jesus ’ going before Pilate . - John 19:12 This put political pressure on Pilate .

AMP	John	20	11	But Mary [ who had returned ] was standing outside the tomb sobbing ; and so , as she wept , she stooped down and looked into the tomb ;

AMP	John	20	19	So when it was evening on that same day , the first day of the week , though the disciples were [ meeting ] behind barred doors for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood among them , and said , “ [ i ] Peace to you. ”
AMP	John	20	21	Then Jesus said to them again , “ Peace to you ; as the Father has sent Me , I also send you [ as My representatives ] . ”

AMP	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the twelve [ disciples ] , who was called Didymus ( the twin ) , was not with them when Jesus came .
AMP	John	20	25	So the other disciples kept telling him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in His hands the marks of the nails , and put my finger into the nail prints , and put my hand into His side , I will never believe. ”
AMP	John	20	26	Eight days later His disciples were again inside the house , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , though the doors had been barred , and stood among them and said , “ Peace to you. ”

AMP	John	20	29	Jesus said to him , “ Because you have seen Me , do you now believe ? Blessed [ happy , spiritually secure , and favored by God ] are they who did not see [ Me ] and yet believed [ in Me ] . ” Purpose of Writing this Gospel
AMP	John	20	30	There are also many other signs ( attesting miracles ) that Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book ;
AMP	John	20	31	but these have been written so that you may believe [ with a deep , abiding trust ] that Jesus is the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , the Son of God ; and that by believing [ and trusting in and relying on Him ] you may have life in His name . ( F ) Footnotes - John 20:2 See note 19:26 . - John 20:2 This indicates others were also present . - John 20:5 Removing the burial wrappings and spices from a dead , decaying body would have been not only extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) , but overwhelmingly nauseating . If a tomb robber had even attempted such a thing , the tomb would have been left in shambles . It would make no sense for a tomb robber to remove a dead body from the wrappings before stealing it . - John 20:7 The word used here , soudarion , is taken from Latin ( sudarium ) , where it refers to a linen handkerchief ( cf Acts 19:12 ) or large linen napkin . This suggests something of the dimensions of the cloth , which was probably a new , unused piece of material . - John 20:7 Jesus either caused the tight linen wrappings to fall from His body miraculously or His resurrected body miraculously passed through the linen wrappings , leaving them just as they were where He was lying ( except for the face-cloth ) , unlike Lazarus who emerged from the tomb and had to be released from the wrappings . In either case , the grave wrappings would collapse on themselves on the flat surface of the slab where His body had been placed . The text also indicates that Jesus may have removed the face-cloth Himself once His hands were free , and neatly placed it apart from the other wrappings . - John 20:8 John , the “ other disciple , ” knew immediately that no one could have fabricated the sight before him : (
AMP	John	20	1	) no one could have surreptitiously removed the stone covering the entrance ( cf Matt 28:2 ) , even if the guards assigned to the tomb had fallen asleep , as they were later paid to say by the chief priests ( Matt 28:13 ) ; (

AMP	John	21	21	So when Peter saw him , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , and what about this [ f ] man [ what is in his future ] ? ”
AMP	John	21	2	Simon Peter , and Thomas who is called Didymus ( the twin ) , and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee , as well as [ John and James ] the sons of Zebedee , and two others of His disciples were together .
AMP	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing. ” They said , “ And we are coming with you. ” So they went out and got into the boat ; and [ a ] that night they caught nothing .
AMP	John	21	4	As morning was breaking , Jesus [ came and ] stood on the beach ; however , the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
AMP	John	21	5	So Jesus said to them , “ Children , do you have any fish [ to eat along with your bread ] ? ” They answered , “ No. ”
AMP	John	21	6	And He said to them , “ Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat ( starboard ) and you will find some. ” So they cast [ the net ] , and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great catch of fish .
AMP	John	21	7	Then that disciple ( John ) whom Jesus loved ( esteemed ) said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he put on his outer tunic ( for he was stripped for work ) and threw himself into the sea [ and swam ashore ] .
AMP	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the small boat , for they were not far from shore , only about a hundred yards away , dragging the net full of fish .
AMP	John	21	9	So when they got out on the beach , they saw a charcoal fire set up and fish on it cooking , and bread .
AMP	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish which you have just caught. ”
AMP	John	21	11	So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net to land , full of large fish , a hundred and fifty-three [ of them ] ; and although there were so many , the net was not torn . Jesus Provides
AMP	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come and have breakfast. ” None of the disciples dared to ask Him , “ Who are You ? ” They knew [ without any doubt ] that it was the Lord .
AMP	John	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , and likewise the fish .
AMP	John	21	14	This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples , after He had risen from the dead . The Love Motivation
AMP	John	21	15	So when they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love Me more than these [ others do—with total commitment and devotion ] ? ” He said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I [ b ] love You [ with a deep , personal affection , as for a close friend ] . ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed My lambs. ”
AMP	John	21	16	Again He said to him a second time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love Me [ with total commitment and devotion ] ? ” He said to Him , “ Yes , Lord ; You know that I love You [ with a deep , personal affection , as for a close friend ] . ” Jesus said to him , “ Shepherd My sheep. ”
AMP	John	21	17	) . - John 21:17 This time Jesus uses the same word for love that Peter previously used twice ( phileo ) . - John 21:19 Peter ministered some thirty years after the resurrection of Jesus . He was martyred in Rome by Emperor Nero in about a.d.
AMP	John	21	18	I assure you and most solemnly say to you , when you were younger you dressed yourself and walked wherever you wished ; but when you grow old , you will stretch out your hands and arms , and someone else will dress you , and carry you where you do not wish to go. ”
AMP	John	21	19	Now He said this to indicate the [ d ] kind of death by which Peter would glorify God . And after saying this , He said to him , “ Follow Me [ walk the same path of life that I have walked ] ! ”
AMP	John	21	20	Peter turned and saw the [ e ] disciple whom Jesus loved following them ; the one who also had leaned back on His chest at the supper and had said , “ Lord , who is it that is going to betray You ? ”
AMP	John	21	22	Jesus said to him , “ If I want him to stay alive until I come [ again ] , what is that to you ? You follow Me ! ”
AMP	John	21	23	So this word went out among the brothers that this disciple ( John ) was not going to die ; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die , but only , “ If I want him to stay alive until I come [ again ] , what is that to you ? ”

AMP	Romans	1	1	Paul , a [ a ] bond-servant of Christ Jesus , called as an apostle ( special messenger , personally chosen representative ) , set apart for [ preaching ] the [ b ] gospel of God [ the good news of salvation ] ,
AMP	Romans	1	2	which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the sacred Scriptures—
AMP	Romans	1	3	[ the good news ] regarding His Son , who , as to the flesh [ His human nature ] , was born a descendant of David [ to fulfill the covenant promises ] ,
AMP	Romans	1	4	and [ as to His divine nature ] according to the Spirit of holiness was openly designated to be the Son of God with power [ in a triumphant and miraculous way ] by His resurrection from the dead : Jesus Christ our Lord .
AMP	Romans	1	5	It is through Him that we have received grace and [ our ] apostleship to promote obedience to the faith and make disciples for His name ’ s sake among all the Gentiles ,
AMP	Romans	1	6	and you also are among those who are called of Jesus Christ to belong to Him ;
AMP	Romans	1	7	[ I am writing ] to all who are beloved of God in Rome , called to be saints ( God ’ s people ) and set apart for a sanctified life , [ that is , set apart for God and His purpose ] : Grace to you and peace [ inner calm and spiritual well-being ] from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
AMP	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith [ your trust and confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] is being proclaimed in all the world .
AMP	Romans	1	9	For God , whom I serve with my spirit by preaching the gospel of His Son , is my witness as to how continuously I mention you
AMP	Romans	1	10	in my prayers ; always pleading that somehow , by God ’ s will , I may now at last come to you .
AMP	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you so that I may share with you some spiritual gift , to strengthen and establish you ;
AMP	Romans	1	12	that is , that we may be mutually encouraged and comforted by each other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .
AMP	Romans	1	13	I do not want you to be unaware , [ c ] brothers and sisters , that many times I have planned to come to you , ( and have been prevented so far ) so that I may have some fruit [ of my labors ] among you , even as I have among the rest of the Gentiles .
AMP	Romans	1	14	I have a duty to perform and a debt to pay both to Greeks and to barbarians [ the cultured and the uncultured ] , both to the wise and to the foolish .
AMP	Romans	1	15	So , for my part , I am ready and eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome .
AMP	Romans	1	16	I am not ashamed of the gospel , for it is the power of God for salvation [ from His wrath and punishment ] to everyone who believes [ in Christ as Savior ] , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
AMP	Romans	1	17	For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed , both springing from faith and leading to faith [ disclosed in a way that awakens more faith ] . As it is written and forever remains written , “ The just and upright shall live by faith. ” ( A ) Unbelief and Its Consequences
AMP	Romans	1	18	For [ God does not overlook sin and ] the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who in their wickedness suppress and stifle the truth ,
AMP	Romans	1	19	because that which is known about God is evident within them [ in their inner consciousness ] , for God made it evident to them .
AMP	Romans	1	20	For ever since the creation of the world His invisible attributes , His eternal power and divine nature , have been clearly seen , being understood through His workmanship [ all His creation , the wonderful things that He has made ] , so that they [ who fail to believe and trust in Him ] are without excuse and without defense . ( B )
AMP	Romans	1	21	For even though [ d ] they knew God [ as the Creator ] , they did not [ e ] honor Him as God or give thanks [ for His wondrous creation ] . On the contrary , they became worthless in their thinking [ godless , with pointless reasonings , and silly speculations ] , and their foolish heart was darkened .
AMP	Romans	1	22	Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
AMP	Romans	1	23	and exchanged the glory and majesty and excellence of the immortal God for [ f ] an image [ worthless idols ] in the shape of mortal man and birds and four-footed animals and reptiles .
AMP	Romans	1	24	Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their own hearts to [ sexual ] impurity , so that their bodies would be dishonored among them [ abandoning them to the degrading power of sin ] ,
AMP	Romans	1	25	because [ by choice ] they exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever ! Amen . ( C )
AMP	Romans	1	26	For this reason God gave them over to degrading and vile passions ; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural [ a function contrary to nature ] ,
AMP	Romans	1	27	and in the same way also the men turned away from the natural function of the woman and were consumed with their desire toward one another , men with men committing shameful acts and in return receiving in their own bodies the inevitable and appropriate penalty for their wrongdoing .
AMP	Romans	1	28	And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God or consider Him worth knowing [ as their Creator ] , God gave them over to a depraved mind , to do things which are improper and repulsive ,
AMP	Romans	1	29	until they were filled ( permeated , saturated ) with every kind of unrighteousness , wickedness , greed , evil ; full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malice and mean-spiritedness . They are gossips [ spreading rumors ] ,
AMP	Romans	1	30	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boastful , inventors [ of new forms ] of evil , disobedient and disrespectful to parents ,
AMP	Romans	1	31	without understanding , untrustworthy , unloving , unmerciful [ without pity ] .
AMP	Romans	1	32	Although they know God ’ s righteous decree and His judgment , that those who do such things deserve death , yet they not only do them , but they even [ enthusiastically ] approve and tolerate others who practice them .

AMP	Romans	2	12	; Gal 1:8 ,
AMP	Romans	2	13	For it is not those who merely hear the Law [ as it is read aloud ] who are just or righteous before God , but it is those who [ actually ] obey the Law who will be [ b ] justified [ pronounced free of the guilt of sin and declared acceptable to Him ] .
AMP	Romans	2	14	When Gentiles , who do not have the Law [ since it was given only to Jews ] , do [ c ] instinctively the things the Law requires [ guided only by their conscience ] , they are a law to themselves , though they do not have the Law .
AMP	Romans	2	15	They show that the [ d ] essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts ; and their conscience [ their sense of right and wrong , their moral choices ] bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or perhaps defending them
AMP	Romans	2	16	on that day when , [ e ] as my gospel proclaims , God will judge the secrets [ all the hidden thoughts and concealed sins ] of men through Christ Jesus . ( C ) The Jew Is Condemned by the Law
AMP	Romans	2	17	But if you bear the name “ Jew ” and rely on the Law [ for your salvation ] and boast in [ your special relationship to ] God ,
AMP	Romans	2	18	and [ if you claim to ] know His will and [ f ] approve the things that are [ g ] essential or have a sense of what is excellent , based on your instruction from the Law ,
AMP	Romans	2	19	and [ if you ] are confident that you are a [ qualified ] guide to the blind [ those untaught in theology ] , a light to those who are in darkness ,
AMP	Romans	2	20	and [ that you are ] [ h ] a corrector of the foolish , a teacher of the [ spiritually ] [ i ] childish , having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth—
AMP	Romans	2	21	well then , you who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal [ in ways that are discrete , but just as sinful ] ?
AMP	Romans	2	22	You who say that one must not commit adultery , [ j ] do you commit adultery ? You who detest idols , do you rob [ pagan ] temples [ of valuable idols and offerings ] ? ( D )
AMP	Romans	2	23	You who boast in the Law , do you [ repeatedly ] dishonor God by [ k ] breaking the Law ?
AMP	Romans	2	24	For , “ the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you , ” just as it is written [ in Scripture ] . ( E )
AMP	Romans	2	25	Circumcision [ the sign of the covenant of Abraham ] is indeed of value if you practice the Law ; but if you habitually break the Law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision [ it is meaningless in God ’ s sight ] .
AMP	Romans	2	26	So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded [ by God ] as circumcision ?
AMP	Romans	2	27	Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps [ the spirit of ] the Law will judge you who , [ l ] even though you have the written code and circumcision , break the Law .
AMP	Romans	2	28	For he is not a [ real ] Jew who is only one outwardly , nor is [ true ] circumcision something external and physical .
AMP	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and [ true ] circumcision is circumcision of the heart , by the Spirit , not by [ the fulfillment of ] the letter [ of the Law ] . His praise is not from men , but from God . Footnotes - Romans 2:1 This is not a prohibition of judgment , nor is it a command to stop using godly wisdom , common sense , and moral courage together with God ’ s written word to discern right from wrong , to distinguish between morality and immorality , and to judge doctrinal truth . There are many judgments that are not only legitimate , but are commanded ( cf John 7:24 ;

AMP	Romans	3	3	What then ? If some did not believe or were unfaithful [ to God ] , their lack of belief will not nullify and make invalid the faithfulness of God and His word , will it ?
AMP	Romans	3	2	Great in every respect . To begin with , the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God [ His very [ a ] words ] . ( A )
AMP	Romans	3	4	Certainly not ! Let God be found true [ as He will be ] , though every person be found a liar , just as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ That You may be justified in Your words , And prevail when You are judged [ by sinful men ] . ” ( B )
AMP	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? God is not wrong to inflict His wrath [ on us ] , is He ? ( I am speaking in purely human terms . )
AMP	Romans	3	6	Certainly not ! For otherwise , how will God judge the world ?
AMP	Romans	3	7	But [ as you might say ] if through my lie God ’ s truth was magnified and abounded to His glory , why am I still being judged as a sinner ?
AMP	Romans	3	8	And why not say , ( as some slanderously report and claim that we teach ) “ Let us do evil so that good may come of it ” ? Their condemnation [ by God ] is just .
AMP	Romans	3	9	Well then , are we [ Jews ] better off than they ? Not at all ; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks ( Gentiles ) are under the control of sin and subject to its power .
AMP	Romans	3	10	As it is written and forever remains written , “ There is none righteous [ none that meets God ’ s standard ] , not even one . ( C )
AMP	Romans	3	11	“ There is none who understands , There is none who seeks for God . ( D )
AMP	Romans	3	12	“ All have turned aside , together they have become useless ; There is none who does good , no , not one. ” ( E )
AMP	Romans	3	13	“ Their throat is an open grave ; They [ habitually ] deceive with their tongues. ” “ The venom of asps is beneath their lips. ” ( F )
AMP	Romans	3	14	“ Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. ” ( G )
AMP	Romans	3	15	“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ,
AMP	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their paths ,
AMP	Romans	3	17	And they have not known the path of peace. ” ( H )
AMP	Romans	3	18	“ There is no fear of God [ and His awesome power ] before their eyes. ” ( I )
AMP	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the Law [ of Moses ] says , it speaks to those who are under the Law , so that [ the excuses of ] every mouth may be silenced [ from protesting ] and that all the world may be held accountable to God [ and subject to His judgment ] .
AMP	Romans	3	20	For no [ b ] person will be justified [ freed of guilt and declared righteous ] in His sight by [ trying to do ] the works of the Law . For through the Law we become conscious of sin [ and the recognition of sin directs us toward repentance , but provides no remedy for sin ] . Justification by Faith
AMP	Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God has been clearly revealed [ independently and completely ] apart from the Law , though it is [ actually ] confirmed by the Law and the [ words and writings of the ] Prophets .
AMP	Romans	3	22	This righteousness of God comes through faith in Jesus Christ for all those [ Jew or Gentile ] who believe [ and trust in Him and acknowledge Him as God ’ s Son ] . There is no distinction , ( J )
AMP	Romans	3	23	since all have sinned and continually fall short of the glory of God ,
AMP	Romans	3	24	and are being justified [ declared free of the guilt of sin , made acceptable to God , and granted eternal life ] as a gift by His [ precious , undeserved ] [ c ] grace , through the redemption [ the payment for our sin ] which is [ provided ] in Christ Jesus ,
AMP	Romans	3	25	whom God displayed publicly [ before the eyes of the world ] as a [ life-giving ] [ d ] sacrifice of atonement and reconciliation ( propitiation ) by His blood [ to be received ] through faith . This was to demonstrate His righteousness [ which demands punishment for sin ] , because in His forbearance [ His deliberate restraint ] He passed over the sins previously committed [ before Jesus ’ crucifixion ] .
AMP	Romans	3	26	It was to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time , so that He would be just and the One who justifies those who have faith in Jesus [ and rely confidently on Him as Savior ] .
AMP	Romans	3	27	Then what becomes of [ our ] boasting ? It is excluded [ entirely ruled out , banished ] . On what principle ? On [ the principle of good ] works ? No , but on the principle of faith .
AMP	Romans	3	28	For we maintain that an individual is justified by faith distinctly apart from works of the Law [ the observance of which has nothing to do with justification , that is , being declared free of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God ] .
AMP	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is He not also the God of Gentiles [ who were not given the Law ] ? Yes , of Gentiles also ,
AMP	Romans	3	30	since indeed it is one [ and the same ] God who will justify the circumcised by faith [ which began with Abraham ] and the uncircumcised through [ their newly acquired ] faith .
AMP	Romans	3	31	Do we then nullify the Law by this faith [ making the Law of no effect , overthrowing it ] ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , we confirm and establish and uphold the Law [ since it convicts us all of sin , pointing to the need for salvation ] .

It is God ’ s amazing gift . - Romans 3:25 By laying his hands on the head of the sacrifice the person offering the sacrifice identified himself with it and through its death it became an atonement or covering for his sin . Because the unblemished sacrifice “ covered ” his sin it placed the person offering the sacrifice in a right relationship with God . Later under the new covenant the perfection and sacrifice of Christ would cover ( atone for ) the imperfection and sin of those who identified with Him and accepted Him as Savior . Copyright ©

AMP	Romans	4	4	Now to a laborer , his wages are not credited as a favor or a gift , but as an obligation [ something owed to him ] .
AMP	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified [ that is , acquitted from the guilt of his sins ] by works [ those things he did that were good ] , he has something to boast about , but not before God .
AMP	Romans	4	3	For what does the Scripture say ? “ Abraham believed in ( trusted , relied on ) God , and it was credited to his account as righteousness ( right living , right standing with God ) . ” ( A )
AMP	Romans	4	5	But to the one who does not work [ that is , the one who does not try to earn his salvation by doing good ] , but believes and completely trusts in Him who justifies the ungodly , his faith is [ b ] credited to him as righteousness ( right standing with God ) .
AMP	Romans	4	6	And in this same way David speaks of the blessing on the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
AMP	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed and happy and favored are those whose lawless acts have been forgiven , And whose sins have been covered up and completely buried .
AMP	Romans	4	8	“ Blessed and happy and favored is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account nor charge against him. ” ( B )
AMP	Romans	4	9	Is this blessing only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? For we say , “ Faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. ”
AMP	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited [ to him ] ? Was it after he had been circumcised , or before ? Not after , but while [ he was ] uncircumcised .
AMP	Romans	4	11	He received the sign of circumcision , a seal or confirmation of the righteousness which he had by faith while [ he was still ] uncircumcised—this was so that he would be the [ spiritual ] father of all who believe without being circumcised—so that righteousness would be credited to them ,
AMP	Romans	4	12	and [ that he would be ] the [ spiritual ] father of those circumcised who are not only circumcised , but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had before he was circumcised .
AMP	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would be heir of the world was not through [ observing the requirements of ] the Law , but through the righteousness of faith . ( C )
AMP	Romans	4	14	If those who are [ followers ] of the Law are [ the true ] heirs [ of Abraham ] , then faith [ leading to salvation ] is of no effect and void , and the promise [ of God ] is nullified .
AMP	Romans	4	15	For the Law results in [ God ’ s ] wrath [ against sin ] , but where there is no law , there is no violation [ of it either ] .
AMP	Romans	4	16	Therefore , [ inheriting ] the promise depends entirely on faith [ that is , confident trust in the unseen God ] , in order that it may be given as an act of grace [ His unmerited favor and mercy ] , so that the promise will be [ legally ] guaranteed to all the descendants [ of Abraham ] —not only for those [ Jewish believers ] who keep the Law , but also for those [ Gentile believers ] who share the faith of Abraham , who is the [ spiritual ] father of us all—
AMP	Romans	4	17	( as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ I have made you a father of many nations ” ) in the sight of Him in whom he believed , that is , God [ c ] who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist . ( D )
AMP	Romans	4	18	In hope against hope Abraham believed that he would become a father of many nations , as he had been promised [ by God ] : “ So [ numberless ] shall your descendants be. ” ( E )
AMP	Romans	4	19	Without becoming weak in faith he considered his own body , now as good as dead [ for producing children ] since he was about a hundred years old , and [ he considered ] the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb . ( F )
AMP	Romans	4	20	But he did not doubt or waver in unbelief concerning the promise of God , but he grew strong and empowered by faith , giving glory to God ,
AMP	Romans	4	21	being fully convinced that God had the power to do what He had promised .
AMP	Romans	4	22	Therefore his faith was credited to him as righteousness ( right standing with God ) . ( G )
AMP	Romans	4	23	Now not for his sake alone was it written that it was credited to him ,
AMP	Romans	4	24	but for our sake also—to whom righteousness will be credited , as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead—

AMP	Romans	5	5	Such hope [ in God ’ s promises ] never disappoints us , because God ’ s love has been abundantly poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
AMP	Romans	5	2	Through Him we also have access by faith into this [ remarkable state of ] grace in which we [ firmly and safely and securely ] stand . Let us rejoice in our [ a ] hope and the confident assurance of [ experiencing and enjoying ] the glory of [ our great ] God [ the manifestation of His excellence and power ] .
AMP	Romans	5	3	And not only this , but [ with joy ] let us exult in our sufferings and rejoice in our hardships , knowing that hardship ( distress , pressure , trouble ) produces patient endurance ;
AMP	Romans	5	4	and endurance , proven character ( spiritual maturity ) ; and proven character , hope and confident assurance [ of eternal salvation ] .
AMP	Romans	5	6	While we were still helpless [ powerless to provide for our salvation ] , at the right time Christ died [ as a substitute ] for the ungodly .
AMP	Romans	5	7	Now it is an extraordinary thing for one to willingly give his life even for an upright man , though perhaps for a good man [ one who is noble and selfless and worthy ] someone might even dare to die .
AMP	Romans	5	8	But God clearly shows and proves His own love for us , by the fact that while we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
AMP	Romans	5	9	Therefore , since we have now been justified [ declared free of the guilt of sin ] by His blood , [ how much more certain is it that ] we will be saved from the [ b ] wrath of God through Him .
AMP	Romans	5	10	For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son , it is much more certain , having been reconciled , that we will be saved [ from the consequences of sin ] by His life [ that is , we will be saved because Christ lives today ] .
AMP	Romans	5	11	Not only that , but we also rejoice in God [ rejoicing in His love and perfection ] through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received and enjoy our reconciliation [ with God ] . ( A )
AMP	Romans	5	12	Therefore , just as sin came into the world through one man , and death through sin , so death spread to all people [ no one being able to stop it or escape its power ] , because they all sinned .
AMP	Romans	5	13	Sin was [ committed ] in the world before the Law [ was given ] , but sin is not charged [ against anyone ] when there is no law [ against it ] .
AMP	Romans	5	14	Yet death ruled [ over mankind ] from Adam to Moses [ the Lawgiver ] , even over those who had not sinned [ c ] as Adam did . Adam is a type of Him ( Christ ) who was to come [ but in reverse—Adam brought destruction , Christ brought salvation ] . ( B )
AMP	Romans	5	15	But the free gift [ of God ] is not like the trespass [ because the gift of grace overwhelms the fall of man ] . For if many died by one man ’ s trespass [ Adam ’ s sin ] , much more [ abundantly ] did God ’ s grace and the gift [ that comes ] by the grace of the one Man , Jesus Christ , overflow to [ benefit ] the many .
AMP	Romans	5	16	Nor is the gift [ of grace ] like that which came through the one who sinned . For on the one hand the judgment [ following the sin ] resulted from one trespass and brought condemnation , but on the other hand the free gift resulted from many trespasses and brought justification [ the release from sin ’ s penalty for those who believe ] .

AMP	Romans	5	19	For just as through one man ’ s disobedience [ his failure to hear , his carelessness ] the many were made sinners , so through the obedience of the one Man the many will be made righteous and acceptable to God and brought into right standing with Him .
AMP	Romans	5	20	But the Law came to increase and expand [ the awareness of ] the trespass [ by defining and unmasking sin ] . But where sin increased , [ God ’ s remarkable , gracious gift of ] grace [ His unmerited favor ] has surpassed it and increased all the more ,

AMP	Romans	6	3	) Ultimate sanctification is that which is to come when the believer stands before God ( Eph 5:26 ,
AMP	Romans	6	4	We have therefore been buried with Him through baptism into death , so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory and power of the Father , we too might walk habitually in newness of life [ abandoning our old ways ] .
AMP	Romans	6	5	For if we have become one with Him [ permanently united ] in the likeness of His death , we will also certainly be [ one with Him and share fully ] in the likeness of His resurrection .
AMP	Romans	6	7	For the person who has died [ with Christ ] has been freed from [ the power of ] sin .
AMP	Romans	6	8	Now if we have died with Christ , we believe that we will also live [ together ] with Him ,
AMP	Romans	6	9	because we know [ the self-evident truth ] that Christ , having been raised from the dead , will never die again ; death no longer has power over Him .
AMP	Romans	6	10	For the death that He died , He died to sin [ ending its power and paying the sinner ’ s debt ] once and for all ; and the life that He lives , He lives to [ glorify ] God [ in unbroken fellowship with Him ] .
AMP	Romans	6	11	Even so , consider yourselves to be dead to sin [ and your relationship to it broken ] , but alive to God [ in unbroken fellowship with Him ] in Christ Jesus .
AMP	Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and passions .
AMP	Romans	6	13	Do not go on offering members of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness . But offer yourselves to God [ in a decisive act ] as those alive [ raised ] from the dead [ to a new life ] , and your members [ all of your abilities—sanctified , set apart ] as instruments of righteousness [ yielded ] to God .
AMP	Romans	6	14	,
AMP	Romans	6	15	What then [ are we to conclude ] ? Shall we sin because we are not under Law , but under [ God ’ s ] grace ? Certainly not !
AMP	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that when you continually offer yourselves to someone to do his will , you are the slaves of the one whom you obey , either [ slaves ] of sin , which leads to death , or of obedience , which leads to righteousness ( right standing with God ) ?
AMP	Romans	6	17	But thank God that though you were slaves of sin , you became obedient with all your heart to the standard of teaching in which you were instructed and to which you were committed .
AMP	Romans	6	18	And having been set free from sin , you have become the slaves of righteousness [ of conformity to God ’ s will and purpose ] .
AMP	Romans	6	19	I am speaking in [ familiar ] human terms because of your natural limitations [ your spiritual immaturity ] . For just as you presented your bodily members as slaves to impurity and to [ moral ] lawlessness , leading to further lawlessness , so now offer your members [ your abilities , your talents ] as slaves to righteousness , leading to [ d ] sanctification [ that is , being set apart for God ’ s purpose ] .
AMP	Romans	6	20	When you were slaves of sin , you were free in regard to righteousness [ you had no desire to conform to God ’ s will ] .
AMP	Romans	6	21	So what benefit did you get at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed ? [ None ! ] For the outcome of those things is death !
AMP	Romans	6	22	But now since you have been set free from sin and have become [ willing ] slaves to God , you have your benefit , resulting in sanctification [ being made holy and set apart for God ’ s purpose ] , and the outcome [ of this ] is eternal life .
AMP	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death , but the free gift of God [ that is , His remarkable , overwhelming gift of grace to believers ] is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 6:1 Grace justifies believers , making them free of the guilt of sin , blameless , so that they may have eternal life . - Romans 6:3 “ Baptize ” is a transliteration of the Greek word baptizo , which means to submerge an object into liquid . In this passage Christ becomes the liquid , metaphorically , and those who are baptized into Him remain in Him forever and benefit from His experiences , including His death . The best news is that Jesus was resurrected , so believers will also experience resurrection ( those who are alive when Christ returns will experience a physical transformation ) . But even now believers experience a kind of resurrection in that they live new lives ( as Paul says , “ walk in newness of life ” ) in a wonderful new relationship with God and their fellow believers . - Romans 6:6 Gr anthropos , i.e . man , person . - Romans 6:19 There are three basic kinds of sanctification in the NT : (

AMP	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? Is the Law sin ? Certainly not ! On the contrary , if it had not been for the Law , I would not have recognized sin . For I would not have known [ for example ] about coveting [ what belongs to another , and would have had no sense of guilt ] if the Law had not [ repeatedly ] said , “ You shall not covet. ” ( A )
AMP	Romans	7	2	For the married woman [ as an example ] is bound and remains bound by law to her husband while he lives ; but if her husband dies , she is released and exempt from the law concerning her husband .
AMP	Romans	7	3	Accordingly , she will be designated as an adulteress if she [ b ] unites herself to another man while her husband is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law [ regarding marriage ] , so that she is not an adulteress if she marries another man .
AMP	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my [ c ] fellow believers , you too died to the Law through the [ crucified ] body of Christ , so that you may belong to another , to Him who was raised from the dead , in order that we may bear fruit for God .
AMP	Romans	7	5	When we were living in the flesh [ trapped by sin ] , the sinful passions , which were awakened by [ that which ] the Law [ identifies as sin ] , were at work in our body to bear fruit for death [ since the willingness to sin led to death and separation from God ] .
AMP	Romans	7	6	But now we have been released from the Law and its penalty , having died [ through Christ ] to that by which we were held captive , so that we serve [ God ] in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter [ of the Law ] .
AMP	Romans	7	8	But sin , finding an opportunity through the commandment [ to express itself ] produced in me every kind of coveting and selfish desire . For without the Law sin is dead [ the recognition of sin is inactive ] .
AMP	Romans	7	9	I was once alive without [ knowledge of ] the Law ; but when the commandment came [ and I understood its meaning ] , sin became alive and I died [ since the Law sentenced me to death ] . ( B )
AMP	Romans	7	10	And the very commandment which was intended to bring life , actually proved to bring death for me . ( C )
AMP	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing its opportunity through the commandment , beguiled and completely deceived me , and [ d ] using it as a weapon killed me [ separating me from God ] .
AMP	Romans	7	12	So then , the Law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good .
AMP	Romans	7	13	Did that which is good [ the Law ] , then become death to me ? Certainly not ! But sin , in order that it might be revealed as sin , was producing death in me by [ using ] this good thing [ as a weapon ] , so that through the commandment sin would become exceedingly sinful . The Conflict of Two Natures
AMP	Romans	7	14	We know that the Law is spiritual , but I am a creature of the flesh [ worldly , self-reliant—carnal and unspiritual ] , sold into slavery to sin [ and serving under its control ] .
AMP	Romans	7	15	For I do not understand my own actions [ I am baffled and bewildered by them ] . I do not practice what I want to do , but I am doing the very thing I hate [ and yielding to my human nature , my worldliness—my sinful capacity ] .
AMP	Romans	7	16	Now if I habitually do what I do not want to do , [ that means ] I agree with the Law , confessing that it is good ( morally excellent ) .
AMP	Romans	7	17	So now [ if that is the case , then ] it is no longer I who do it [ the disobedient thing which I despise ] , but the sin [ nature ] which lives in me .
AMP	Romans	7	18	For I know that nothing good lives in me , that is , in my flesh [ my human nature , my worldliness—my sinful capacity ] . For the willingness [ to do good ] is present in me , but the doing of good is not .
AMP	Romans	7	19	For the good that I want to do , I do not do , but I practice the very evil that I do not want .
AMP	Romans	7	20	But if I am doing the very thing I do not want to do , I am no longer the one doing it [ that is , it is not me that acts ] , but the sin [ nature ] which lives in me .
AMP	Romans	7	21	So I find it to be the law [ of my inner self ] , that evil is present in me , the one who wants to do good .
AMP	Romans	7	22	For I joyfully delight in the law of God in my inner self [ with my new nature ] , ( D )
AMP	Romans	7	23	but I see a different law and rule of action in the members of my body [ in its appetites and desires ] , waging war against the law of my mind and subduing me and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is within my members .
AMP	Romans	7	24	Wretched and miserable man that I am ! Who will [ rescue me and ] set me free from this body of death [ this corrupt , mortal existence ] ?
AMP	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God [ for my deliverance ] through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , on the one hand I myself with my mind serve the law of God , but on the other , with my flesh [ my human nature , my worldliness , my sinful capacity—I serve ] the law of sin .

AMP	Romans	8	8	and those who are in the flesh [ living a life that caters to sinful appetites and impulses ] can not please God .
AMP	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life [ which is ] in Christ Jesus [ the law of our new being ] has set you free from the law of sin and of death .
AMP	Romans	8	3	For what the Law could not do [ that is , overcome sin and remove its penalty , its power ] being weakened by the flesh [ man ’ s nature without the Holy Spirit ] , God did : He sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful man as an offering for sin . And He condemned sin in the flesh [ subdued it and overcame it in the person of His own Son ] , ( B )
AMP	Romans	8	4	so that the [ righteous and just ] requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us who do not live our lives in the ways of the flesh [ guided by worldliness and our sinful nature ] , but [ live our lives ] in the ways of the Spirit [ guided by His power ] .
AMP	Romans	8	5	For those who are living according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh [ which gratify the body ] , but those who are living according to the Spirit , [ set their minds on ] the things of the Spirit [ His will and purpose ] .
AMP	Romans	8	6	Now the mind of the flesh is death [ both now and forever—because it pursues sin ] ; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace [ the spiritual well-being that comes from walking with God—both now and forever ] ;
AMP	Romans	8	7	the mind of the flesh [ with its sinful pursuits ] is actively hostile to God . It does not submit itself to God ’ s law , since it can not ,
AMP	Romans	8	9	However , you are not [ living ] in the flesh [ controlled by the sinful nature ] but in the Spirit , if in fact the Spirit of God lives in you [ directing and guiding you ] . But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , he does not belong to Him [ and is not a child of God ] . ( C )
AMP	Romans	8	10	If Christ lives in you , though your [ natural ] body is dead because of sin , your spirit is alive because of righteousness [ which He provides ] .
AMP	Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you , He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit , who lives in you .
AMP	Romans	8	12	So then , [ a ] brothers and sisters , we have an obligation , but not to our flesh [ our human nature , our worldliness , our sinful capacity ] , to live according to the [ impulses of the ] flesh [ our nature without the Holy Spirit ] —
AMP	Romans	8	13	for if you are living according to the [ impulses of the ] flesh , you are going to die . But if [ you are living ] by the [ power of the Holy ] Spirit you are habitually putting to death the sinful deeds of the body , you will [ really ] live forever .
AMP	Romans	8	14	For all who are allowing themselves to be led by the Spirit of God are sons of God .
AMP	Romans	8	15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading again to fear [ of God ’ s judgment ] , but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons [ the Spirit producing sonship ] by which we [ joyfully ] cry , “ [ b ] Abba ! Father ! ”
AMP	Romans	8	16	The Spirit Himself testifies and confirms together with our spirit [ assuring us ] that we [ believers ] are children of God .
AMP	Romans	8	17	And if [ we are His ] children , [ then we are His ] heirs also : heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [ sharing His spiritual blessing and inheritance ] , if indeed we share in His suffering so that we may also share in His glory . ( D )
AMP	Romans	8	18	For I consider [ from the standpoint of faith ] that the sufferings of the present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us and in us !
AMP	Romans	8	19	For [ even the whole ] creation [ all nature ] waits eagerly for the children of God to be revealed .
AMP	Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to frustration and futility , not willingly [ because of some intentional fault on its part ] , but by the will of Him who subjected it , in hope ( E )
AMP	Romans	8	21	that the creation itself will also be freed from its bondage to decay [ and gain entrance ] into the glorious freedom of the children of God .
AMP	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation has been moaning together as in the pains of childbirth until now . ( F )
AMP	Romans	8	23	And not only this , but we too , who have the first fruits of the Spirit [ a joyful indication of the blessings to come ] , even we groan inwardly , as we wait eagerly for [ the sign of ] our adoption as sons—the redemption and transformation of our body [ at the resurrection ] . ( G )
AMP	Romans	8	24	For in this hope we were saved [ by faith ] . But hope [ the object of ] which is seen is not hope . For who hopes for what he already sees ?
AMP	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see , we wait eagerly for it with patience and composure . Our Victory in Christ
AMP	Romans	8	26	In the same way the Spirit [ comes to us and ] helps us in our weakness . We do not know what prayer to offer or how to offer it as we should , but the Spirit Himself [ knows our need and at the right time ] intercedes on our behalf with sighs and groanings too deep for words .
AMP	Romans	8	27	And He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is , because the Spirit intercedes [ before God ] on behalf of [ c ] God ’ s people in accordance with God ’ s will . ( H )
AMP	Romans	8	28	And we know [ with great confidence ] that God [ who is deeply concerned about us ] causes all things to work together [ as a plan ] for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to His plan and purpose .
AMP	Romans	8	29	For those whom He foreknew [ and loved and chose beforehand ] , He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son [ and ultimately share in His complete sanctification ] , so that He would be the firstborn [ the most beloved and honored ] among many believers .
AMP	Romans	8	30	And those whom He predestined , He also called ; and those whom He called , He also justified [ declared free of the guilt of sin ] ; and those whom He justified , He also glorified [ raising them to a heavenly dignity ] .
AMP	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say to all these things ? If God is for us , who can be [ successful ] against us ? ( I )
AMP	Romans	8	32	He who did not spare [ even ] His own Son , but gave Him up for us all , how will He not also , along with Him , graciously give us all things ?
AMP	Romans	8	33	Who will bring any charge against God ’ s elect ( His chosen ones ) ? It is God who justifies us [ declaring us blameless and putting us in a right relationship with Himself ] .
AMP	Romans	8	34	Who is the one who condemns us ? Christ Jesus is the One who died [ to pay our penalty ] , and more than that , who was raised [ from the dead ] , and who is at the right hand of God interceding [ with the Father ] for us .
AMP	Romans	8	35	Who shall ever separate us from the love of [ d ] Christ ? Will tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
AMP	Romans	8	36	Just as it is written and forever remains written , “ For Your sake we are put to death all day long ; We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter. ” ( J )
AMP	Romans	8	37	Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors and gain an overwhelming victory through Him who loved us [ so much that He died for us ] .
AMP	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced [ and continue to be convinced—beyond any doubt ] that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor things present and threatening , nor things to come , nor powers ,
AMP	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the [ unlimited ] love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .

AMP	Romans	9	9	For this is what the promise said : “ About this time [ next year ] I will come , and Sarah shall have a son. ” ( D )
AMP	Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart .
AMP	Romans	9	3	For [ if it were possible ] I would wish that I myself were accursed , [ separated , banished ] from Christ for the sake [ of the salvation ] of my brothers , my natural kinsmen , ( A )
AMP	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites , to whom belongs the adoption as sons , the glory ( [ a ] Shekinah ) , the [ special ] covenants [ with Abraham , Moses , and David ] , the giving of the Law , the [ system of temple ] worship , and the [ original ] promises . ( B )
AMP	Romans	9	5	To them belong the patriarchs , and from them , according to His natural descent , came the Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) , He who is exalted and supreme over all , God blessed forever . Amen .
AMP	Romans	9	6	However , it is not as though God ’ s word has failed [ coming to nothing ] . For not all who are descended from Israel ( Jacob ) are [ the true ] Israel ;
AMP	Romans	9	7	and they are not all the children of Abraham because they are his descendants [ by blood ] , but [ the promise was ] : “ Your descendants will be named through Isaac ” [ though Abraham had other sons ] . ( C )
AMP	Romans	9	8	That is , it is not the children of the body [ Abraham ’ s natural descendants ] who are God ’ s children , but it is the children of the promise who are counted as [ Abraham ’ s true ] descendants .
AMP	Romans	9	10	And not only that , but this too : Rebekah conceived twin sons by one man [ under the same circumstances ] , by our father Isaac ;
AMP	Romans	9	11	and though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything either good or bad , so that God ’ s purpose [ His choice , His election ] would stand , not because of works [ done by either child ] , but because of [ the plan of ] Him who calls them ,
AMP	Romans	9	12	it was said to her , “ The [ b ] older ( Esau ) will serve the [ c ] younger ( Jacob ) . ” ( E )
AMP	Romans	9	13	As it is written and forever remains written , “ [ d ] Jacob I loved ( chose , protected , blessed ) , but [ e ] Esau I hated ( held in disregard compared to Jacob ) . ” ( F )
AMP	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? Is there injustice with God ? Certainly not !
AMP	Romans	9	15	For He says to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion. ” ( G )
AMP	Romans	9	16	So then God ’ s choice is not dependent on human will , nor on human effort [ the totality of human striving ] , but on God who shows mercy [ to whomever He chooses—it is His sovereign gift ] .
AMP	Romans	9	17	For the Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ I raised you up for this very purpose , to display My power in [ dealing with ] you , and so that My name would be proclaimed in all the earth. ” ( H )
AMP	Romans	9	18	So then , He has mercy on whom He wills ( chooses ) , and He hardens [ the heart of ] whom He wills .
AMP	Romans	9	19	You will say to me then , “ Why does He still blame me [ for sinning ] ? For who [ including myself ] has [ ever ] resisted His will and purpose ? ”
AMP	Romans	9	20	On the contrary , who are you , O man , who answers [ arrogantly ] back to God and dares to defy Him ? Will the thing which is formed say to him who formed it , “ Why have you made me like this ? ” ( I )
AMP	Romans	9	21	Does the potter not have the right over the clay , to make from the same lump [ of clay ] one object for honorable use [ something beautiful or distinctive ] and another for common use [ something ordinary or menial ] ?
AMP	Romans	9	22	What if God , although willing to show His [ terrible ] wrath and to make His power known , has tolerated with great patience the objects of His wrath [ which are ] prepared for destruction ? ( J )
AMP	Romans	9	23	And what if He has done so to make known the riches of His glory to the objects of His mercy , which He has prepared beforehand for glory ,
AMP	Romans	9	24	including us , whom He also called , not only from among the Jews , but also from among the Gentiles ?
AMP	Romans	9	25	Just as He says in [ the writings of the prophet ] Hosea : “ I will call those who were not My people , ‘ My people , ’ And [ I will call ] her who was not beloved , ‘ beloved. ’ ” ( K )
AMP	Romans	9	26	“ And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them , ‘ you are not My people , ’ There they shall be called sons of the living God. ” ( L )
AMP	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah calls out concerning Israel : “ Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea , it is only the remnant [ a small believing minority ] that will be saved [ from God ’ s judgment ] ;
AMP	Romans	9	28	For the Lord will execute His word upon the earth [ He will conclude His dealings with mankind ] completely and without delay. ” ( M )
AMP	Romans	9	29	It is as Isaiah foretold , “ If the Lord of Hosts had not left us seed [ future generations from which a believing remnant of Israelites came ] , We would have become like Sodom , and would have resembled Gomorrah [ totally rejected and destroyed ] ! ” ( N )
AMP	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then ? That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness [ who did not seek salvation and a right relationship with God , nevertheless ] obtained righteousness , that is , the righteousness which is produced by faith ;
AMP	Romans	9	31	whereas Israel , [ though always ] pursuing the law of righteousness , did not succeed in fulfilling the law . ( O )
AMP	Romans	9	32	And why not ? Because it was not by faith [ that they pursued it ] , but as though it were by works [ relying on the merit of their works instead of their faith ] . They stumbled over the stumbling Stone [ Jesus Christ ] . ( P )
AMP	Romans	9	33	As it is written and forever remains written , “ Behold I am laying in Zion a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense ; And he who believes in Him [ whoever adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] will not be disappointed [ in his expectations ] . ” ( Q ) Footnotes - Romans 9:4 The Hebrew word “ Shekinah ” ( “ divine presence ” ) does not appear in Scripture , but has been used by both Christians and Jews to describe the visible Presence of God ( the brilliant light of the divine ) , in such things as the burning bush , the cloud and the pillar of fire that led the Hebrews in the wilderness , and the Presence of God that rested between the cherubim over the mercy seat of the ark . It is said in the Talmud that the Emperor Hadrian once told a rabbi , “ I want to see your God. ” The rabbi replied , “ You can not see him. ” “ Indeed , ” said the Emperor , “ I will see him. ” So the rabbi took the Emperor and positioned him to face the sun during the summer solstice , and said to him , “ Look at it. ” He replied , “ I am not able to. ” The rabbi said , “ If you are not able to look at the sun , which is merely one of the servants that attend the Holy One—blessed be He—then how can you presume to look at the divine presence ! ” - Romans 9:12 The descendants of Esau , the Edomites . - Romans 9:12 The descendants of Jacob ( Israel ) , the Israelites . - Romans 9:13 The Israelites received God ’ s protection and blessing . - Romans 9:13 The Edomites were left to God ’ s judgment .

AMP	Romans	10	10	For with the heart a person believes [ in Christ as Savior ] resulting in his justification [ that is , being made righteous—being freed of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to God ] ; and with the mouth he acknowledges and confesses [ his faith openly ] , resulting in and confirming [ his ] salvation .
AMP	Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a certain enthusiasm for God , but not in accordance with [ correct and vital ] knowledge [ about Him and His purposes ] .
AMP	Romans	10	3	For not knowing about God ’ s righteousness [ which is based on faith ] , and seeking to establish their own [ righteousness based on works ] , they did not submit to God ’ s righteousness .
AMP	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law [ it leads to Him and its purpose is fulfilled in Him ] , for [ granting ] righteousness to everyone who believes [ in Him as Savior ] .
AMP	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law [ with all its intricate demands ] shall live by it . ( A )
AMP	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness based on faith [ which produces a right relationship with Him ] says the following : “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into Heaven ? ’ that is , to bring Christ down ;
AMP	Romans	10	7	or , ‘ Who will descend into the abyss ? ’ that is , to bring Christ up from the dead [ as if we had to be saved by our own efforts , doing the impossible ] . ” ( B )
AMP	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” —that is , the word [ the message , the basis ] of faith which we preach— ( C )
AMP	Romans	10	9	because if you acknowledge and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord [ recognizing His power , authority , and majesty as God ] , and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead , you will be saved .
AMP	Romans	10	11	For the Scripture says , “ Whoever believes in Him [ whoever adheres to , trusts in , and relies on Him ] will not be disappointed [ in his expectations ] . ” ( D )
AMP	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile ; for the same Lord is Lord over all [ of us ] , and [ He is ] abounding in riches ( blessings ) for all who call on Him [ in faith and prayer ] .
AMP	Romans	10	13	For “ whoever calls on the name of the Lord [ in prayer ] will be saved. ” ( E )
AMP	Romans	10	14	But how will people call on Him in whom they have not believed ? And how will they believe in Him of whom they have not heard ? And how will they hear without a preacher ( messenger ) ?
AMP	Romans	10	15	And how will they preach unless they are commissioned and sent [ for that purpose ] ? Just as it is written and forever remains written , “ How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things ! ” ( F )
AMP	Romans	10	16	But they did not all pay attention to the good news [ of salvation ] ; for Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our report ? ” ( G )
AMP	Romans	10	17	So faith comes from hearing [ what is told ] , and what is heard comes by the [ preaching of the ] message concerning Christ .
AMP	Romans	10	18	But I say , did they not hear ? Indeed they have ; “ Their voice [ that of creation bearing God ’ s message ] has gone out to all the earth , And their words to the [ farthest ] ends of the world. ” ( H )
AMP	Romans	10	19	But I say , did Israel fail to understand [ that the gospel was to go also to the Gentiles ] ? First Moses says , “ I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation ( Gentiles ) ; With a nation that lacks understanding I will make you angry. ” ( I )
AMP	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah is very bold and says , “ I have been found by those who did not seek Me ; I have shown Myself to those who did not [ consciously ] ask for Me. ” ( J )

AMP	Romans	11	11	So I say , have they stumbled so as to fall [ to spiritual ruin ] ? Certainly not ! But by their transgression [ their rejection of the Messiah ] salvation has come to the Gentiles , to make Israel jealous [ when they realize what they have forfeited ] .

AMP	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , they have killed Your prophets , they have torn down Your altars , and I alone am left [ of the prophets ] , and they are seeking my life. ”
AMP	Romans	11	4	But what is God ’ s response to him ? “ I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal. ” ( C )
AMP	Romans	11	5	So too then , at the present time there has come to be a remnant [ a small believing minority ] according to God ’ s gracious choice .
AMP	Romans	11	6	But if it is by grace [ God ’ s unmerited favor ] , it is no longer on the basis of works , otherwise grace is no longer grace [ it would not be a gift but a reward for works ] .
AMP	Romans	11	7	What then ? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking [ that is , God ’ s favor by obedience to the Law ] , but the elect [ those chosen few ] obtained it , while the rest of them became hardened and callously indifferent ;
AMP	Romans	11	8	just as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , Eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear , [ a spiritual apathy that has continued ] to this very day. ” ( D )
AMP	Romans	11	9	And David says , “ Let their table ( abundance ) become a snare and a trap , A stumbling block and a retribution to them . ( E )
AMP	Romans	11	10	“ Let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see , And make their backs bend [ under their burden ] forever. ” ( F )
AMP	Romans	11	12	Now if Israel ’ s transgression means riches for the world [ at large ] and their failure means riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their fulfillment and reinstatement be !
AMP	Romans	11	13	But now I am speaking to you who are Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles , I magnify my ministry ,
AMP	Romans	11	14	in the hope of somehow making my fellow countrymen jealous [ by stirring them up so that they will seek the truth ] and perhaps save some of them .
AMP	Romans	11	15	For if their [ present ] rejection [ of salvation ] is for the reconciliation of the world [ to God ] , what will their acceptance [ of salvation ] be but [ nothing less than ] life from the dead ?
AMP	Romans	11	16	If the first portion [ of dough offered as the first fruits ] is holy , so is the whole batch ; and if the root ( Abraham , the patriarchs ) is holy , so are the branches ( the Israelites ) . ( G )
AMP	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you [ Gentiles ] , being like a wild olive shoot , were grafted in among them to share with them the rich root of the olive tree ,
AMP	Romans	11	18	do not boast over the [ broken ] branches and exalt yourself at their expense . If you do boast and feel superior , remember that it is not you who supports the root , but the root that supports you .
AMP	Romans	11	19	You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
AMP	Romans	11	20	That is true . They were broken off because of their unbelief , but you stand by your faith [ as believers understanding the truth of Christ ’ s deity ] . Do not be conceited , but [ rather stand in great awe of God and ] fear [ Him ] ;
AMP	Romans	11	21	for if God did not spare the natural branches [ because of unbelief ] , He will not spare you either .
AMP	Romans	11	22	Then appreciate the gracious kindness and the severity of God : to those who fell [ into spiritual ruin ] , severity , but to you , God ’ s gracious kindness—if you continue in His kindness [ by faith and obedience to Him ] ; otherwise you too will be cut off .
AMP	Romans	11	23	And even they [ the unbelieving Jews ] , if they do not continue in their unbelief , will be grafted in ; for God has the power to graft them in again .
AMP	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much easier will it be to graft these who are the natural branches back into [ the original parent stock of ] their own olive tree ?
AMP	Romans	11	25	I do not want you , believers , to be unaware of this mystery [ God ’ s previously hidden plan ] —so that you will not be wise in your own opinion—that a partial hardening has [ temporarily ] happened to Israel [ to last ] until the full number of the Gentiles has come in ;
AMP	Romans	11	26	and so [ at that time ] all Israel [ that is , all Jews who have a personal faith in Jesus as Messiah ] will be saved ; just as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ The Deliverer ( Messiah ) will come from Zion , He will remove ungodliness from Jacob. ” ( H )
AMP	Romans	11	27	“ This is My covenant with them , When I take away their sins. ” ( I )
AMP	Romans	11	28	From the standpoint of the gospel , the Jews [ at present ] are enemies [ of God ] for your sake [ which is for your benefit ] , but from the standpoint of God ’ s choice [ of the Jews as His people ] , they are still loved by Him for the sake of the fathers .
AMP	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable [ for He does not withdraw what He has given , nor does He change His mind about those to whom He gives His grace or to whom He sends His call ] .
AMP	Romans	11	30	Just as you once were disobedient and failed to listen to God , but have now obtained mercy because of their disobedience ,
AMP	Romans	11	31	so they too have now become disobedient so that they too may one day receive mercy because of the mercy shown to you .
AMP	Romans	11	32	For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all [ Jew and Gentile alike ] .
AMP	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are His judgments and decisions and how unfathomable and untraceable are His ways !
AMP	Romans	11	34	For who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been His counselor ? ( J )
AMP	Romans	11	35	Or who has first given to Him that it would be paid back to him ?
AMP	Romans	11	36	For from Him [ all things originate ] and through Him [ all things live and exist ] and to Him are all things [ directed ] . To Him be glory and honor forever ! Amen . Copyright ©

AMP	Romans	12	12	constantly rejoicing in hope [ because of our confidence in Christ ] , steadfast and patient in distress , devoted to prayer [ continually seeking wisdom , guidance , and strength ] ,
AMP	Romans	12	2	And do not be conformed to this world [ any longer with its superficial values and customs ] , but be [ c ] transformed and progressively changed [ as you mature spiritually ] by the renewing of your mind [ focusing on godly values and ethical attitudes ] , so that you may prove [ for yourselves ] what the will of God is , that which is good and acceptable and perfect [ in His plan and purpose for you ] .
AMP	Romans	12	3	For by the grace [ of God ] given to me I say to everyone of you not to think more highly of himself [ and of his importance and ability ] than he ought to think ; but to think so as to have sound judgment , as God has apportioned to each a degree of faith [ and a purpose designed for service ] .
AMP	Romans	12	4	For just as in one [ physical ] body we have many parts , and these parts do not all have the same function or special use ,
AMP	Romans	12	5	so we , who are many , are [ nevertheless just ] one body in Christ , and individually [ we are ] parts one of another [ mutually dependent on each other ] .
AMP	Romans	12	6	Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us , each of us is to use them accordingly : if [ someone has the gift of ] prophecy , [ let him speak a new message from God to His people ] in proportion to the faith possessed ;
AMP	Romans	12	7	if service , in the act of serving ; or he who teaches , in the act of teaching ;
AMP	Romans	12	8	or he who encourages , in the act of encouragement ; he who gives , with generosity ; he who leads , [ d ] with diligence ; he who shows mercy [ in caring for others ] , with cheerfulness .
AMP	Romans	12	9	Love is to be sincere and active [ the real thing—without guile and hypocrisy ] . Hate what is evil [ detest all ungodliness , do not tolerate wickedness ] ; hold on tightly to what is good .
AMP	Romans	12	10	Be devoted to one another with [ authentic ] brotherly affection [ as members of one family ] , give preference to one another in honor ;
AMP	Romans	12	11	never lagging behind in diligence ; aglow in the Spirit , enthusiastically serving the Lord ;
AMP	Romans	12	13	contributing to the needs of God ’ s people , pursuing [ the practice of ] hospitality .
AMP	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you [ who cause you harm or hardship ] ; bless and do not curse [ them ] . ( A )
AMP	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice [ sharing others ’ joy ] , and weep with those who weep [ sharing others ’ grief ] .
AMP	Romans	12	16	Live in harmony with one another ; do not be haughty [ conceited , self-important , exclusive ] , but associate with humble people [ those with a realistic self-view ] . Do not overestimate yourself . ( B )
AMP	Romans	12	17	Never repay anyone evil for evil . Take thought for what is right and gracious and proper in the sight of everyone . ( C )
AMP	Romans	12	18	If possible , as far as it depends on you , live at peace with everyone .
AMP	Romans	12	19	Beloved , never avenge yourselves , but leave the way open for God ’ s wrath [ and His judicial righteousness ] ; for it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ Vengeance is Mine , I will repay , ” says the Lord . ( D )
AMP	Romans	12	20	But if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink ; for by doing this you will heap [ e ] burning coals on his head. ” ( E )

AMP	Romans	13	13	Let us conduct ourselves properly and honorably as in the [ light of ] day , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual promiscuity and irresponsibility , not in quarreling and jealousy .
AMP	Romans	13	2	Therefore whoever [ a ] resists [ governmental ] authority resists the ordinance of God . And those who have resisted it will bring judgment ( civil penalty ) on themselves .
AMP	Romans	13	3	For [ civil ] authorities are not a source of fear for [ people of ] good behavior , but for [ those who do ] evil . Do you want to be unafraid of authority ? Do what is good and you will receive approval and commendation .
AMP	Romans	13	4	For he is God ’ s servant to you for good . But if you do wrong , [ you should ] be afraid ; for he does not carry the [ executioner ’ s ] sword for nothing . He is God ’ s servant , an avenger who brings punishment on the wrongdoer .
AMP	Romans	13	5	Therefore one must be subject [ to civil authorities ] , not only to escape the punishment [ that comes with wrongdoing ] , but also as a matter of principle [ knowing what is right before God ] .
AMP	Romans	13	6	For this same reason you pay taxes , for civil authorities are God ’ s servants , devoting themselves to governance .
AMP	Romans	13	7	Pay to all what is due : tax to whom tax is due , customs to whom customs , respect to whom respect , honor to whom honor .
AMP	Romans	13	8	[ b ] Owe nothing to anyone except to [ c ] love and seek the best for one another ; for he who [ unselfishly ] loves his neighbor has fulfilled the [ essence of the ] law [ relating to one ’ s fellowman ] . ( B )
AMP	Romans	13	9	The commandments , “ You shall not commit adultery , you shall not murder , you shall not steal , you shall not covet , ” and any other commandment are summed up in this statement : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ” ( C )
AMP	Romans	13	10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor [ it never hurts anyone ] . Therefore [ unselfish ] love is the fulfillment of the Law .
AMP	Romans	13	11	Do this , knowing that this is a critical time . It is already the hour for you to awaken from your sleep [ of spiritual complacency ] ; for our salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed [ in Christ ] .
AMP	Romans	13	12	The night [ this present evil age ] is almost gone and the day [ of Christ ’ s return ] is almost here . So let us fling away the works of darkness and put on the [ full ] armor of light .
AMP	Romans	13	14	But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for [ nor even think about gratifying ] the flesh in regard to its improper desires . Footnotes - Romans 13:2 An exception to this is recorded in Acts 5:27-29 . See especially v
AMP	Romans	13	29	. - Romans 13:8 Debt is generally to be avoided , but Paul probably is addressing debt to individuals with whom one has a personal relationship . - Romans 13:8 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love ( the Greek word agape ) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person , that is , having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for other believers .

AMP	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced [ as one ] in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean [ ritually defiled , and unholy ] in itself ; but [ nonetheless ] it is unclean to anyone who thinks it is unclean .
AMP	Romans	14	2	One man ’ s faith permits him to eat everything , while the weak believer eats only vegetables [ to avoid eating ritually unclean meat or something previously considered unclean ] .
AMP	Romans	14	3	The one who eats [ everything ] is not to look down on the one who does not eat , and the one who does not eat must not criticize or pass judgment on the one who eats [ everything ] , for God has accepted him .
AMP	Romans	14	4	Who are you to judge the servant of another ? Before his own master he stands [ approved ] or falls [ out of favor ] . And he [ who serves the Master—the Lord ] will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
AMP	Romans	14	5	One person regards one day as better [ or more important ] than another , while another regards every day [ the same as any other ] . Let everyone be fully convinced ( assured , satisfied ) in his own mind .
AMP	Romans	14	6	He who observes the day , observes it for the Lord . He who eats , eats for the Lord , since he gives thanks to God ; while he who abstains , abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God .
AMP	Romans	14	7	None of us lives for himself [ for his own benefit , but for the Lord ] , and none of us dies for himself [ but for the Lord ] .
AMP	Romans	14	8	If we live , we live for the Lord , and if we die , we die for the Lord . So then , whether we live or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
AMP	Romans	14	9	For Christ died and lived again for this reason , that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
AMP	Romans	14	10	But you , why do you criticize your brother ? Or you again , why do you look down on your [ believing ] brother or regard him with contempt ? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God [ who alone is judge ] .
AMP	Romans	14	11	For it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow to Me , And every tongue shall give praise to God. ” ( A )
AMP	Romans	14	12	So then , each of us will give an account of himself to God .
AMP	Romans	14	13	Then let us not criticize one another anymore , but rather determine this—not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block or a source of temptation in another believer ’ s way .
AMP	Romans	14	15	If your brother is being hurt or offended because of food [ that you insist on eating ] , you are no longer walking in love [ toward him ] . Do not let what you eat destroy and spiritually harm one for whom Christ died .
AMP	Romans	14	16	Therefore do not let what is a good thing for you [ because of your freedom to choose ] be spoken of as evil [ by someone else ] ;
AMP	Romans	14	17	for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking [ what one likes ] , but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
AMP	Romans	14	18	For the one who serves Christ in this way [ recognizing that food choice is secondary ] is acceptable to God and is approved by men .
AMP	Romans	14	19	So then , let us pursue [ with enthusiasm ] the things which make for peace and the building up of one another [ things which lead to spiritual growth ] .
AMP	Romans	14	20	Do not , for the sake of food , tear down the work of God . All things indeed are [ ceremonially ] clean , but they are wrong for the person who eats and offends [ another ’ s conscience in the process ] .
AMP	Romans	14	21	It is good [ to do the right thing and ] not eat meat or drink wine , or do anything that offends your brother and weakens him spiritually .
AMP	Romans	14	22	The faith which you have [ that gives you freedom of choice ] , have as your own conviction before God [ just keep it between yourself and God , seeking His will ] . Happy is he who has no reason to condemn himself for what he approves .
AMP	Romans	14	23	But he who is uncertain [ about eating a particular thing ] is condemned if he eats , because he is not acting from faith . Whatever is not from faith is sin [ whatever is done with doubt is sinful ] . Footnotes - Romans 14:1 Some Jewish believers may have struggled with abandoning all the old requirements of the Law regarding eating things considered unclean , while some Gentile believers may have been overly sensitive to anything associated with paganism , such as eating meat offered to idols .

AMP	Romans	15	15	Still , on some points I have written to you very boldly and without reservation to remind you [ about them ] again , because of the grace that was given to me from God ,
AMP	Romans	15	2	Let each one of us [ make it a practice to ] please his [ a ] neighbor for his good , to build him up spiritually .
AMP	Romans	15	3	For even Christ did not please Himself ; but as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ The reproaches of those who reproached You ( the Father ) fell on Me ( the Son ) . ” ( A )
AMP	Romans	15	4	For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction , so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope and overflow with confidence in His promises .
AMP	Romans	15	5	Now may the God who gives endurance and who supplies encouragement grant that you be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus ,
AMP	Romans	15	6	so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify and praise and honor the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
AMP	Romans	15	7	Therefore , [ continue to ] accept and welcome one another , just as Christ has accepted and welcomed us to the glory of [ our great ] God .
AMP	Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant and a minister to the circumcision ( Jews ) on behalf of God ’ s truth , to confirm and verify the promises made to the fathers ,
AMP	Romans	15	9	and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy [ to them , since God had no covenant with them ] . As it is written and forever remains written , “ Therefore I praise You among the Gentiles , And sing praises to Your name. ” ( B )
AMP	Romans	15	10	Again it says , “ Rejoice and celebrate , O Gentiles , along with His people. ” ( C )
AMP	Romans	15	11	And again , “ Praise the Lord all you Gentiles , And let all the peoples praise Him ! ” ( D )
AMP	Romans	15	12	Again Isaiah says , “ There shall be a root of [ b ] Jesse , He who arises to rule [ as King ] over the Gentiles , In Him shall the Gentiles hope. ” ( E )
AMP	Romans	15	13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing [ through the experience of your faith ] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you will abound in hope and overflow with confidence in His promises .
AMP	Romans	15	14	Personally I am convinced about you , my brothers and sisters , that you yourselves are full of goodness , amply filled with all [ spiritual ] knowledge , and competent to admonish and counsel and instruct one another .
AMP	Romans	15	16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I minister as a priest the gospel of God , in order that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable [ to Him ] , sanctified [ made holy and set apart for His purpose ] by the Holy Spirit .
AMP	Romans	15	17	In Christ Jesus , then , I have found [ legitimate ] reason for boasting in things related [ to my service ] to God .
AMP	Romans	15	18	For I will not [ even ] presume to speak of anything except what Christ has done through me [ as an instrument in His hands ] , resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles [ to the gospel ] , by word and deed ,
AMP	Romans	15	19	with the power of signs and wonders , [ and all of it ] in the power of the Spirit . So [ starting ] from Jerusalem and as far away as [ c ] Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel [ faithfully preaching the good news ] of Christ [ where it had not before been preached ] .
AMP	Romans	15	20	Accordingly I set a goal to preach the gospel , not where Christ ’ s name was already known , so that I would not build on another man ’ s foundation ;
AMP	Romans	15	21	but [ instead I would act on this goal ] as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ They who had no news of Him shall see , And they who have not heard [ of Him ] shall understand. ” ( F )
AMP	Romans	15	22	This [ goal—my commitment to this principle ] is the reason why I have often been prevented from coming to you [ in Rome ] .
AMP	Romans	15	23	But now , with no further place for work in these regions , and since I have longed for many years to come to you—
AMP	Romans	15	24	whenever I go [ on my trip ] to Spain—I hope to see you as I pass through [ Rome ] , and to be helped on my journey there by you , after I have first enjoyed your company for a little while .
AMP	Romans	15	25	But for now , I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints ( Jewish believers ) .
AMP	Romans	15	26	For [ Gentile believers in ] [ d ] Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints ( Jewish believers ) in Jerusalem .
AMP	Romans	15	27	They were pleased to do it , and they are indebted to them . For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual things , then they are indebted to serve them also in [ tangible ] material things .
AMP	Romans	15	28	Therefore , when I have finished this [ mission ] and have safely given to them what has been raised , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
AMP	Romans	15	29	I know that when I do come to you , I will come in the abundant blessing of Christ .
AMP	Romans	15	30	I urge you , believers , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join together with me in your prayers to God in my behalf ,
AMP	Romans	15	31	[ and pray ] that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea , and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ( Jewish believers ) there ;
AMP	Romans	15	32	so that by God ’ s will I may come to you with joy and find rest in your company .
AMP	Romans	15	33	May the God of peace be with you all ! Amen .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God in Corinth , to those sanctified ( set apart , made holy ) in Christ Jesus , who are selected and called as saints ( God ’ s people ) , together with all those who in every place call on and honor the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , their Lord and ours :
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace [ inner calm and spiritual well-being ] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	5	so that in everything you were [ exceedingly ] enriched in Him , in all speech [ empowered by the spiritual gifts ] and in all knowledge [ with insight into the faith ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	6	In this way our testimony about Christ was confirmed and established in you ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift [ which comes from the Holy Spirit ] , as you eagerly wait [ with confident trust ] for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ [ when He returns ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	8	And He will also confirm you to the end [ keeping you strong and free of any accusation , so that you will be ] blameless and beyond reproach in the day [ of the return ] of our Lord Jesus Christ .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful [ He is reliable , trustworthy and ever true to His promise—He can be depended on ] , and through Him you were called into fellowship with His Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	10	But I urge you , believers , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you be in full agreement in what you say , and that there be no divisions or factions among you , but that you be perfectly united in your way of thinking and in your judgment [ about matters of the faith ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For I have been informed about you , my brothers and sisters , by those of Chloe ’ s household , that there are quarrels and factions among you .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now I mean this , that each one of you says , “ I am [ a disciple ] of Paul , ” or “ I am [ a disciple ] of Apollos , ” or “ I am [ a disciple ] of Cephas ( Peter ) , ” or “ I am [ a disciple ] of Christ. ”
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Has Christ been divided [ into different parts ] ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul ? [ Certainly not ! ]
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius , ( A )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	16	Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; beyond that , I do not know if I baptized anyone else .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me [ as an apostle ] to baptize , but [ commissioned and empowered me ] to preach the good news [ of salvation ] —not with clever and eloquent speech [ as an orator ] , so that the cross of Christ would not be [ b ] made ineffective [ deprived of its saving power ] . The Wisdom of God
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the message of the cross is foolishness [ absurd and illogical ] to those who are perishing and spiritually dead [ because they reject it ] , but to us who are being saved [ by God ’ s grace ] it is [ the manifestation of ] the power of God .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written and forever remains written , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise [ the philosophy of the philosophers ] , And the cleverness of the clever [ who do not know Me ] I will nullify. ” ( B )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise man ( philosopher ) ? Where is the scribe ( scholar ) ? Where is the debater ( logician , orator ) of this age ? Has God not exposed the foolishness of this world ’ s wisdom ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since the world through all its [ earthly ] wisdom failed to recognize God , God in His wisdom was well-pleased through the [ c ] foolishness of the message preached [ regarding salvation ] to save those who believe [ in Christ and welcome Him as Savior ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For Jews demand signs ( attesting miracles ) , and Greeks pursue [ worldly ] wisdom and philosophy ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified , [ a message which is ] to Jews a stumbling block [ that provokes their opposition ] , and to Gentiles foolishness [ just utter nonsense ] ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are the called , both Jews and Greeks ( Gentiles ) , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God . ( C )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	25	[ This is ] because the foolishness of God [ is not foolishness at all and ] is wiser than men [ far beyond human comprehension ] , and the weakness of God is stronger than men [ far beyond the limits of human effort ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Just look at your own calling , believers ; not many [ of you were considered ] wise according to human standards , not many powerful or influential , not many of high and noble birth .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God has selected [ for His purpose ] the foolish things of the world to shame the wise [ revealing their ignorance ] , and God has selected [ for His purpose ] the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong [ revealing their frailty ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	28	God has selected [ for His purpose ] the insignificant ( base ) things of the world , and the things that are despised and treated with contempt , [ even ] the things that are nothing , so that He might reduce to nothing the things that are ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that no one may [ be able to ] boast in the presence of God .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus , who became to us wisdom from God [ revealing His plan of salvation ] , and righteousness [ making us acceptable to God ] , and sanctification [ making us holy and setting us apart for God ] , and redemption [ providing our ransom from the penalty for sin ] ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	1	31	so then , as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ He who boasts and glories , let him boast and glory in the Lord. ” ( D ) Footnotes -

AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians 2:2 In reality , Paul was a highly-trained student of the Old Testament writings , Jewish law , and of logic and rhetoric ; and evidently he was conversant in Roman law as well . When preaching the gospel , however , he focused on the message itself and the power of God , and not on rhetorical techniques of persuasion ( see vv
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	2	for I made the decision to [ b ] know nothing [ that is , to forego philosophical or theological discussions regarding inconsequential things and opinions while ] among you except Jesus Christ , and Him crucified [ and the meaning of His redemptive , substitutionary death and His resurrection ] .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Yet we do speak wisdom among those spiritually mature [ believers who have teachable hearts and a greater understanding ] ; but [ it is a higher ] wisdom not [ the wisdom ] of this present age nor of the rulers and leaders of this age , who are passing away ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	7	but we speak God ’ s wisdom in a mystery , the wisdom once hidden [ from man , but now revealed to us by God , that wisdom ] which God predestined before the ages to our glory [ to lift us into the glory of His presence ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this age recognized and understood this wisdom ; for if they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	9	but just as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ Things which the eye has not seen and the ear has not heard , And which have not entered the heart of man , All that God has prepared for those who love Him [ who hold Him in affectionate reverence , who obey Him , and who gratefully recognize the benefits that He has bestowed ] . ” ( A )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	10	For God has unveiled them and revealed them to us through the [ Holy ] Spirit ; for the Spirit searches all things [ diligently ] , even [ sounding and measuring ] the [ profound ] depths of God [ the divine counsels and things far beyond human understanding ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what person knows the thoughts and motives of a man except the man ’ s spirit within him ? So also no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the [ Holy ] Spirit who is from God , so that we may know and understand the [ wonderful ] things freely given to us by God .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	13	We also speak of these things , not in words taught or supplied by human wisdom , but in those taught by the Spirit , combining and interpreting spiritual thoughts with spiritual words [ for those being guided by the Holy Spirit ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the natural [ unbelieving ] man does not accept the things [ the teachings and revelations ] of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness [ absurd and illogical ] to him ; and he is incapable of understanding them , because they are spiritually discerned and appreciated , [ and he is unqualified to judge spiritual matters ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But the spiritual man [ the spiritually mature Christian ] judges all things [ questions , examines and applies what the Holy Spirit reveals ] , yet is himself judged by no one [ the unbeliever can not judge and understand the believer ’ s spiritual nature ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who has known the mind and purposes of the Lord , so as to instruct Him ? But we have the mind of Christ [ to be guided by His thoughts and purposes ] . ( B ) Footnotes -

AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	3	,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk , not solid food ; for you were not yet able to receive it . Even now you are still not ready .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For when one of you says , “ I am [ a disciple ] of Paul , ” and another , “ I am [ a disciple ] of Apollos , ” are you not [ proving yourselves unchanged , just ] ordinary people ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? And what is Paul ? Just servants through whom you believed [ in Christ ] , even as the Lord appointed to each his task .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered , but God [ all the while ] was causing the growth .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So neither is the one who plants nor the one who waters anything , but [ only ] God who causes the growth .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	8	He who plants and he who waters are one [ in importance and esteem , working toward the same purpose ] ; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	9	,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the [ remarkable ] grace of God which was given to me [ to prepare me for my task ] , like a skillful master builder I laid a foundation , and now another is building on it . But each one must be careful how he builds on it ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	11	for no one can lay a foundation other than the one which is [ already ] laid , which is Jesus Christ .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	12	But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , straw ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	13	each one ’ s work will be clearly shown [ for what it is ] ; for the day [ of judgment ] will disclose it , because it is to be revealed with fire , and the fire will test the quality and character and worth of each person ’ s work . ( B )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any person ’ s work which he has built [ on this foundation , that is , any outcome of his effort ] remains [ and survives this test ] , he will receive a reward .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	15	,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	16	,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys the temple of God [ corrupting it with false doctrine ] , God will destroy the destroyer ; for the temple of God is holy ( sacred ) , and that is what you are .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age , let him become a fool [ discarding his worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom ] , so that he may become [ truly ] wise . ( D )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	19	; 9:13 ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the [ humanly ] wise , that they are useless. ” ( F )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So let no one boast in men [ about their wisdom , or of having this or that one as a leader ] . For all things are yours ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas ( Peter ) or the world or life or death or things present or things to come ; all things are yours ,

AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I am aware of nothing against myself and I feel blameless , but I am not by this acquitted [ before God ] . It is the Lord who judges me .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	2	In this case , moreover , it is required [ as essential and demanded ] of stewards that one be found faithful and trustworthy .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But [ as for me personally ] it matters very little to me that I may be judged by you or any human court [ on this point ] ; in fact , I do not even judge myself .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So do not go on passing judgment before the appointed time , but wait until the Lord comes , for He will both bring to light the [ secret ] things that are hidden in darkness and disclose the motives of the hearts . Then each one ’ s praise will come from God .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now I have applied these things [ that is , the analogies about factions ] to myself and Apollos for your benefit , believers , so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written [ in Scripture ] , so that none of you will become arrogant and boast in favor of one [ minister or teacher ] against the other .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who regards you as superior or what sets you apart as special ? What do you have that you did not receive [ from another ] ? And if in fact you received it [ from God or someone else ] , why do you boast as if you had not received it [ but had gained it by yourself ] ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	8	[ You behave as if ] you are already filled [ with spiritual wisdom and in need of nothing more ] . Already you have become rich [ in spiritual gifts ] ! You [ in your conceit ] have ascended your thrones and become kings without us ; and how I wish [ that it were true and ] that you did reign as kings , so that we might reign with you .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For , I think , God has exhibited us apostles at the end of the line , like men sentenced to death [ and paraded as prisoners in a procession ] , because we have become a spectacle to the world [ a show in the world ’ s amphitheater ] , both to angels and to men .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are [ regarded as ] fools for Christ , but you are so wise in Christ ; we are weak , but you are strong ; you are highly esteemed , but we are dishonored .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	11	To this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty ; we are continually poorly dressed , and we are roughly treated , and wander homeless .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work [ for our living ] , working hard with our own hands . When we are reviled and verbally abused , we bless . When we are persecuted , we take it patiently and endure .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When we are slandered , we try to be conciliatory and answer softly . We have become like the scum of the world , the dregs of all things , even until now .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I do not write these things to shame you , but to warn and advise you as my beloved children .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For even if you were to have ten thousand teachers [ to guide you ] in Christ , yet you would not have many fathers [ who led you to Christ and assumed responsibility for you ] , for I became your father in Christ Jesus through the good news [ of salvation ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	16	So I urge you , be imitators of me [ just as a child imitates his father ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this reason I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , and he will remind you of my way of life in Christ [ my conduct and my precepts for godly living ] , just as I teach everywhere in every church .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some of you have become arrogant and pretentious , as though I were not coming to see you .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you soon , if the Lord is willing , and I will find out not just the talk of these arrogant people , but [ evaluate ] their [ spiritual ] power [ whether they live up to their own claims ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not based on talk but on power .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	5	7	[ d ] Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new batch , just as you are , still unleavened . For Christ our Passover Lamb has been sacrificed .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning the virgins [ of marriageable age ] I have no command of the Lord , but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord ’ s mercy is trustworthy .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think then that because of the impending distress [ that is , the pressure of the current trouble ] , it is good for a man to remain as he is .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be released . Are you [ l ] unmarried ? Do not seek a wife .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you do marry , you have not sinned [ in doing so ] ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned [ in doing so ] . Yet those [ who marry ] will have troubles ( special challenges ) in this life , and I am trying to spare you that .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But I say this , believers : the [ m ] time has been shortened , so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they did not ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep , as though they did not weep ; and those who rejoice , as though they did not rejoice ; and those who buy , as though they did not possess [ anything ] ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who use the world [ taking advantage of its opportunities ] , as though they did not make full use of it . For the outward form of this world [ its present social and material nature ] is passing away .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I want you to be free from concern . The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	33	but the married man is concerned about worldly things , how he may please his wife ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and his interests are divided . The unmarried woman or the virgin is concerned about the matters of the Lord , how to be holy and set apart both in body and in spirit ; but a married woman is concerned about worldly things , how she may please her husband .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	35	Now I say this for your own benefit ; not to restrict you , but to promote what is appropriate and secure undistracted devotion to the Lord .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly and honorably toward his virgin daughter , [ [ n ] by not permitting her to marry ] , if she is [ o ] past her youth , and it must be so , let him do as he wishes , he does not sin ; let her marry .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But the man who stands firmly committed in his heart , having no compulsion [ to yield to his daughter ’ s request ] , and has authority over his own will , and has decided in his own heart to keep his own virgin [ daughter from being married ] , he will do well .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then both the father who gives his virgin daughter in marriage does well , and he who does not give her in marriage will do better .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound [ to her husband by law ] as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry whomever she wishes , only [ provided that he too is ] in the Lord .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But in my opinion a widow is happier if she stays as she is . And I think that I also have the Spirit of God [ in this matter ] . Footnotes -

AMP	1%20Corinthians	8	11	For through your knowledge ( spiritual maturity ) this weak man is ruined [ that is , he suffers in his spiritual life ] , the brother for whom Christ died .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now these things happened to them as an example and warning [ to us ] ; they were written for our instruction [ to admonish and equip us ] , upon whom the ends of the ages have come .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore let the one who thinks he stands firm [ immune to temptation , being overconfident and self-righteous ] , take care that he does not fall [ into sin and condemnation ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	10	13	No temptation [ regardless of its source ] has overtaken or enticed you that is not common to human experience [ nor is any temptation unusual or beyond human resistance ] ; but God is faithful [ to His word—He is compassionate and trustworthy ] , and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability [ to resist ] , but along with the temptation He [ has in the past and is now and ] will [ always ] provide the way out as well , so that you will be able to endure it [ without yielding , and will overcome temptation with joy ] .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful [ that is , morally legitimate , permissible ] , but not all things are beneficial or advantageous . All things are lawful , but not all things are constructive [ to character ] and edifying [ to spiritual life ] .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman originates from the man , so also man is born through the woman ; and all things [ whether male or female ] originate from God [ as their Creator ] .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	23	[ i ] For I received from the Lord Himself that [ instruction ] which I passed on to you , that the Lord Jesus on the night in which He was betrayed took bread ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and when He had given thanks , He broke it and said , “ This is ( represents ) My body , which is [ offered as a sacrifice ] for you . Do this in [ affectionate ] remembrance of Me. ”
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way , after supper He took the cup , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant [ ratified and established ] in My blood ; do this , as often as you drink it , in [ affectionate ] remembrance of Me. ”
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup , you are [ symbolically ] proclaiming [ the fact of ] the Lord ’ s death until He comes [ again ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [ of Him ] will be guilty of [ profaning and sinning against ] the body and blood of the Lord .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But a person must [ prayerfully ] examine himself [ and his relationship to Christ ] , and only when he has done so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For anyone who eats and drinks [ without solemn reverence and heartfelt gratitude for the sacrifice of Christ ] , eats and drinks a judgment on himself if he does not [ j ] recognize the body [ of Christ ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	30	That [ careless and unworthy participation ] is the reason why many among you are weak and sick , and a number sleep [ in death ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we evaluated and judged ourselves honestly [ recognizing our shortcomings and correcting our behavior ] , we would not be judged .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we [ fall short and ] are judged by the Lord , we are disciplined [ by undergoing His correction ] so that we will not be condemned [ to eternal punishment ] along with the world .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers and sisters , when you come together to eat [ the Lord ’ s Supper ] , wait for one another [ and see to it that no one is left out ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is too hungry [ to wait ] , let him eat at home , so that you will not come together for judgment [ on yourselves ] . About the remaining matters [ of which I was informed ] , I will take care of them when I come . Footnotes -

AMP	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so that there would be no division or discord in the body [ that is , lack of adaptation of the parts to each other ] , but that the parts may have the same concern for one another .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffers , all the parts share the suffering ; if one member is honored , all rejoice with it .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So it is with you , if you speak words [ in an unknown tongue ] that are not intelligible and clear , how will anyone understand what you are saying ? You will be talking into the air [ wasting your breath ] !
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , I suppose , a great many kinds of languages in the world [ unknown to us ] , and none is lacking in meaning .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	11	But if I do not know the meaning of the language , I will [ appear to ] be a [ c ] foreigner to the one who is speaking [ since he knows exactly what he is saying ] , and the one who is speaking will [ appear to ] be a foreigner to me .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So it is with you , since you are so very eager to have spiritual gifts and manifestations of the Spirit , strive to excel in ways that will build up the church [ spiritually ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may [ be gifted to ] translate or explain [ what he says ] .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	21	It is written in the Law , “ By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people , and not even then will they listen to Me , ” says the Lord . ( B )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Therefore , [ unknown ] tongues are [ meant ] for a [ supernatural ] sign , not to believers but to unbelievers [ who might be receptive ] ; while prophecy [ foretelling the future , speaking a new message from God to the people ] is not for unbelievers but for believers .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	23	So then , if the whole church gathers together and all of you speak in [ unknown ] tongues , and outsiders or those who are not gifted [ in spiritual matters ] or unbelievers come in , will they not say that you are out of your mind ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy [ foretelling the future , speaking a new message from God to the people ] , and an unbeliever or outsider comes in , he is convicted [ of his sins ] by all , and he is called to account by all [ because he can understand what is being said ] ;

AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	38	If anyone does not recognize this [ that it is a command of the Lord ] , he is not recognized [ by God ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Therefore , believers , desire earnestly to prophesy [ to foretell the future , to speak a new message from God to the people ] , and do not forbid speaking in unknown tongues .

AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	15	We are even discovered to be false witnesses [ misrepresenting ] God , because we testified concerning Him that He raised Christ , whom He did not raise , if in fact the dead are not raised .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	2	By this faith you are saved [ reborn from above—spiritually transformed , renewed , and set apart for His purpose ] , if you hold firmly to the word which I preached to you , unless you believed in vain [ just superficially and without complete commitment ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received , that Christ died for our sins according to [ that which ] the Scriptures [ foretold ] , ( A )

AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then He was seen by James , then by all the apostles ,

AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	9	) . -
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the [ remarkable ] grace of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me was not without effect . In fact , I worked harder than all of the apostles , though it was not I , but the grace of God [ His unmerited favor and blessing which was ] with me .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	11	So whether it was I or they , this is what we preach , and this is what you believed and trusted in and relied on with confidence .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead , how is it that [ c ] some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , then not even Christ has been raised ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	14	and if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is vain [ useless , amounting to nothing ] , and your faith is also vain [ imaginary , unfounded , devoid of value and benefit—not based on truth ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , then Christ has not been raised , either ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ has not been raised , your faith is worthless and powerless [ mere delusion ] ; you are still in your sins [ and under the control and penalty of sin ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we who are [ abiding ] in Christ have hoped only in this life [ and this is all there is ] , then we are of all people most miserable and to be pitied . The Order of Resurrection
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now [ as things really are ] Christ has in fact been raised from the dead , [ and He became ] the first fruits [ that is , the first to be resurrected with an incorruptible , immortal body , foreshadowing the resurrection ] of those who have fallen asleep [ in death ] . ( D )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since [ it was ] by a man that death came [ into the world ] , it is also by a Man that the resurrection of the dead has come .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For just as [ d ] in Adam all die , so also [ e ] in Christ all will be made alive .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , then those who are Christ ’ s [ own will be resurrected with incorruptible , immortal bodies ] at His coming .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	24	After that comes the end ( completion ) , when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father , after He has made inoperative and abolished every ruler and every authority and power .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For Christ must reign [ as King ] until He has put all His enemies under His feet . ( E )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be abolished and put to an end is death .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For He ( the Father ) has put all things in subjection under His ( Christ ’ s ) feet . But when He says , “ All things have been put in subjection [ under Christ ] , ” it is clear that He ( the Father ) who put all things in subjection to Him ( Christ ) is excepted [ since the Father is not in subjection to His own Son ] . ( F )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	28	However , when all things are subjected to Him ( Christ ) , then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One ( the Father ) who put all things under Him , so that God may be all in all [ manifesting His glory without any opposition , the supreme indwelling and controlling factor of life ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what will those do who are being [ f ] baptized for the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people even baptized for them ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	30	[ For that matter ] why are we [ running such risks and putting ourselves ] [ g ] in danger [ nearly ] every hour [ if there is no resurrection ] ?
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I assure you , believers , by the pride which I have in you in [ your union with ] Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily [ I face death and die to self ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	32	What good has it done me if , [ merely ] from a human point of view , I [ h ] fought with wild animals at Ephesus ? If the dead are not raised [ at all ] , let us eat and drink [ enjoying ourselves now ] , for tomorrow we die . ( G )

AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Be sober-minded [ be sensible , wake up from your spiritual stupor ] as you ought , and stop sinning ; for some [ of you ] have no knowledge of God [ you are disgracefully ignorant of Him , and ignore His truths ] . I say this to your shame .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? And with what kind of body will they come ? ”
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	36	You fool ! Every time you plant seed you sow something that does not come to life [ germinating , springing up and growing ] unless it first dies .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	37	The seed you sow is not the body ( the plant ) which it is going to become , but it is a bare seed , perhaps of wheat or some other grain .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body just as He planned , and to each kind of seed a body of its own [ is given ] . ( H )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same . There is one kind for humans , another for animals , another for birds , and another for fish .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also heavenly bodies [ sun , moon and stars ] and earthly bodies [ humans , animals , and plants ] , but the glory and beauty of the heavenly is one kind , and the glory of the earthly is another .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is a glory and beauty of the sun , another glory of the moon , and yet another [ distinctive ] glory of the stars ; and one star differs from another in glory and brilliance .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So it is with the resurrection of the dead . The [ human ] body that is sown is perishable and mortal , it is raised imperishable and immortal . ( I )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory ; it is sown in weakness , it is raised in strength ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	44	it is sown a natural body [ mortal , suited to earth ] , it is raised a spiritual body [ immortal , suited to heaven ] . As surely as there is a physical body , there is also a spiritual body .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ The first man , Adam , became a living soul ( an individual ) ; ” the last Adam ( Christ ) became a life-giving spirit [ restoring the dead to life ] . ( J )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	46	However , the spiritual [ the immortal life ] is not first , but the physical [ the mortal life ] ; then the spiritual .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man [ Adam ] is from the earth , earthy [ made of dust ] ; the second Man [ Christ , the Lord ] is from heaven . ( K )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthly man [ the man of dust ] , so are those who are of earth ; and as is the heavenly [ Man ] , so are those who are of heaven .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just as we have borne the image of the earthly [ the man of dust ] , [ j ] we will also bear the image of the heavenly [ the Man of heaven ] . The Mystery of Resurrection
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now I say this , believers , that flesh and blood can not inherit nor be part of the kingdom of God ; nor does the perishable ( mortal ) inherit the imperishable ( immortal ) .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Listen very carefully , I tell you a mystery [ a secret truth decreed by God and previously hidden , but now revealed ] ; we will not all sleep [ in death ] , but we will all be [ completely ] changed [ wondrously transformed ] ,
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at [ the sound of ] the last trumpet call . For a trumpet will sound , and the dead [ who believed in Christ ] will be raised imperishable , and we will be [ completely ] changed [ wondrously transformed ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this perishable [ part of us ] must put on the imperishable [ nature ] , and this mortal [ part of us that is capable of dying ] must put on immortality [ which is freedom from death ] .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	54	And when this perishable puts on the imperishable , and this mortal puts on immortality , then the Scripture will be fulfilled that says , “ Death is swallowed up in victory ( vanquished forever ) . ( L )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	55	O death , where is your victory ? O death , where is your sting ? ” ( M )
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin [ by which it brings death ] is the law ;
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	57	but thanks be to God , who gives us the victory [ as conquerors ] through our Lord Jesus Christ .
AMP	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Therefore , my beloved brothers and sisters , be steadfast , immovable , always excelling in the work of the Lord [ always doing your best and doing more than is needed ] , being continually aware that your labor [ even to the point of exhaustion ] in the Lord is not futile nor wasted [ it is never without purpose ] .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be uninformed , brothers and sisters , about [ d ] our trouble in [ the west coast province of ] Asia [ Minor ] , how we were utterly weighed down , beyond our strength , so that we despaired even of life [ itself ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	9	Indeed , we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death [ and were convinced that we would die , but this happened ] so that we would not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	10	He rescued us from so great a threat of death , and will continue to rescue us . On Him we have set our hope . And He will again rescue us [ from danger and draw us near ] ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	11	while you join in helping us by your prayers . Then thanks will be given by many persons on our behalf for the gracious gift [ of deliverance ] granted to us through the prayers of many [ believers ] . Paul ’ s Integrity
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	12	This is our [ reason for ] proud confidence : our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world [ in general ] , and especially toward you , with pure motives and godly sincerity , not in human wisdom , but in the grace of God [ that is , His gracious lovingkindness that leads people to Christ and spiritual maturity ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write you nothing other than what you read and understand [ there is no double meaning in what we say ] . And I hope you will [ accurately ] understand [ divine things ] until the end ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you have [ already ] partially understood us , [ and one day will recognize ] that you can be proud of us just as we are of you , in the day of our Lord Jesus .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	15	It was with this confidence that I planned at first to visit you , so that you might receive twice a token of grace ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	16	that is , [ I wanted ] to visit you on my way to Macedonia , and [ then ] to come back to you [ on my return ] from Macedonia , and have you send me on my way to Judea .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	17	So then , was I indecisive or capricious when I was [ originally ] planning this ? Or the things I plan , do I plan [ e ] in a self-serving way like a worldly man , ready to say , “ Yes , yes ” and “ No , no ” [ at the same time ] ?
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But [ as surely as ] God is faithful and means what He says , our message to you is not “ Yes ” and “ No ” [ at the same time ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , by me , Silvanus , and Timothy , was not “ Yes ” and “ No , ” but has proved to be “ Yes ” in Him [ true and faithful , the divine “ Yes ” affirming God ’ s promises ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For as many as are the promises of God , in Christ they are [ all answered ] “ Yes. ” So through Him we say our “ Amen ” to the glory of God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now it is God who establishes and confirms us [ in joint fellowship ] with you in Christ , and who has anointed us [ empowering us with the gifts of the Spirit ] ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	22	it is He who has also put His seal on us [ that is , He has appropriated us and certified us as His ] and has given us the [ Holy ] Spirit in our hearts as a pledge [ like a security deposit to guarantee the fulfillment of His promise of eternal life ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But I call on God as my soul ’ s witness , that it was to spare you [ pain and discouragement ] that I did not come again to Corinth—
AMP	2%20Corinthians	1	24	not that we rule [ like dictators ] over your faith , but rather we work with you for [ the increase of ] your joy ; for in your faith you stand firm [ in your strong conviction that Jesus of Nazareth—the Messiah—is the Son of God , through whom we obtain eternal salvation ] .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	2	Corinthians 2:8 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love ( the Greek word agape ) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person , that is , having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for other believers . Copyright ©
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I [ a ] wrote this same thing to you , so that when I came , I would not be filled with sorrow by those who ought to make me glad , for I trusted in you and felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For I wrote to you out of great distress and with an anguished heart , and with many tears , not to cause you sorrow but to make you realize the [ overflowing ] love which I have especially for you .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if [ b ] someone has caused [ all this ] sorrow , he has caused it not to me , but in some degree—not to put it too severely— [ he has distressed and grieved ] all of you .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	6	For such a one this punishment by the majority is sufficient ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	7	so instead [ of further rebuke , now ] you should rather [ graciously ] forgive and comfort and encourage him , to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I urge you to reinstate him in your affections and reaffirm your [ c ] love for him .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For this was my purpose in writing , to see if you would stand the test , whether you are obedient and committed to following my instruction in all things .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	10	If you forgive anyone anything , I too forgive [ that one ] ; and what I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , has been for your sake in the presence of [ and with the approval of ] Christ ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	11	to keep Satan from taking advantage of us ; for we are not ignorant of his schemes .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I arrived at Troas to preach the good news of Christ , even though a door [ of opportunity ] opened for me in the Lord ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	13	my spirit could not rest because I did not find my brother Titus there ; so saying goodbye to them , I left for Macedonia .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and through us spreads and makes evident everywhere the sweet fragrance of the knowledge of Him .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [ which ascends ] to God , [ discernible both ] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to the latter one an aroma from death to death [ a fatal , offensive odor ] , but to the other an aroma from life to life [ a vital fragrance , living and fresh ] . And who is adequate and sufficiently qualified for these things ?
AMP	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not like many , [ acting like merchants ] peddling God ’ s word [ shortchanging and adulterating God ’ s message ] ; but from pure [ uncompromised ] motives , as [ commissioned and sent ] from God , we speak [ His message ] in Christ in the sight of God .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	2	You are our letter [ of recommendation ] , written in our hearts , recognized and read by everyone .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	3	You show that you are a letter from Christ , delivered by us , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts . ( A )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Such is the confidence and steadfast reliance and absolute trust that we have through Christ toward God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficiently qualified in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us , but our sufficiency and qualifications come from God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	6	He has qualified us [ making us sufficient ] as ministers of a new covenant [ of salvation through Christ ] , not of the letter [ of a written code ] but of the Spirit ; for the letter [ of the Law ] kills [ by revealing sin and demanding obedience ] , but the Spirit gives life . ( B )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	7	Now if the ministry of death , engraved in letters on stones [ the covenant of the Law which led to death because of sin ] , came with such glory and splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory , [ a brilliance ] that was fading , ( C )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how will the ministry of the Spirit [ the new covenant which allows us to be Spirit-filled ] fail to be even more glorious and splendid ?
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministry that brings condemnation [ the old covenant , the Law ] has glory , how much more does glory overflow in the ministry that brings righteousness [ the new covenant which declares believers free of guilt and sets them apart for God ’ s special purpose ] !
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	10	Indeed , what had glory [ the Law ] , in this case no longer has glory because of the glory that surpasses it [ the gospel ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that [ Law ] which fades away came with glory , how much more must that [ gospel ] which remains and is permanent abide in glory and splendor !
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Since we have such a [ glorious ] hope and confident expectation , we speak with great courage ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and we are not like Moses , who used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not gaze at the end of the glory which was fading away .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But [ in fact ] their minds were hardened [ for they had lost the ability to understand ] ; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted , because it is removed [ only ] in Christ .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But to this day whenever Moses is read , a veil [ of blindness ] lies over their heart ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	16	but whenever a person turns [ in repentance and faith ] to the Lord , the veil is taken away .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty [ emancipation from bondage , true freedom ] . ( D )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	3	18	And we all , with unveiled face , continually seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are progressively being transformed into His image from [ one degree of ] glory to [ even more ] glory , which comes from the Lord , [ who is ] the Spirit . Copyright ©

AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	2	But we have renounced the disgraceful things hidden because of shame ; not walking in trickery or adulterating the word of God , but by stating the truth [ openly and plainly ] , we commend ourselves to everyone ’ s conscience in the sight of God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	4	among them the god of this world [ Satan ] has blinded the minds of the unbelieving to prevent them from seeing the illuminating light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But even if our gospel is [ in some sense ] hidden [ behind a veil ] , it is hidden [ only ] to those who are perishing ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we do not preach ourselves , but Jesus Christ as Lord , and ourselves [ merely ] as your bond-servants for Jesus ’ sake .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who said , “ Let light shine out of darkness , ” is the One who has shone in our hearts to give us the Light of the knowledge of the glory and majesty of God [ clearly revealed ] in the face of Christ . ( A )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this precious treasure [ the good news about salvation ] in [ unworthy ] earthen vessels [ of human frailty ] , so that the grandeur and surpassing greatness of the power will be [ shown to be ] from God [ His sufficiency ] and not from ourselves .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are pressured in every way [ hedged in ] , but not crushed ; perplexed [ unsure of finding a way out ] , but not driven to despair ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	9	hunted down and persecuted , but not deserted [ to stand alone ] ; struck down , but never destroyed ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	10	always carrying around in the body the dying of Jesus , so that the [ resurrection ] life of Jesus also may be shown in our body .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are constantly [ experiencing the threat of ] being handed over to death for Jesus ’ sake , so that the [ resurrection ] life of Jesus also may be evidenced in our mortal body [ which is subject to death ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So physical death is [ actively ] at work in us , but [ spiritual ] life [ is actively at work ] in you .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	13	Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had , who wrote in Scripture , “ I believed , therefore I spoke. ” We also believe , therefore we also speak , ( B )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	14	knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and will present us [ along ] with you in His presence .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all [ these ] things are for your sake , so that as [ God ’ s remarkable , undeserved ] grace reaches to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving , to the glory of [ our great ] God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we do not become discouraged [ spiritless , disappointed , or afraid ] . Though our outer self is [ progressively ] wasting away , yet our inner self is being [ progressively ] renewed day by day .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our momentary , light distress [ this passing trouble ] is producing for us an eternal weight of glory [ a fullness ] beyond all measure [ surpassing all comparisons , a transcendent splendor and an endless blessedness ] !
AMP	2%20Corinthians	4	18	So we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are unseen ; for the things which are visible are temporal [ just brief and fleeting ] , but the things which are invisible are everlasting and imperishable . Copyright ©

AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now He who has made us and prepared us for this very purpose is God , who gave us the [ Holy ] Spirit as a pledge [ a guarantee , a down payment on the fulfillment of His promise ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	3	so that by putting it on we will not be found naked .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For while we are in this tent , we groan , being burdened [ often weighed down , oppressed ] , not that we want to be unclothed [ separated by death from the body ] , but to be clothed , so that what is mortal [ the body ] will be swallowed up by life [ after the resurrection ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So then , being always filled with good courage and confident hope , and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for we walk by faith , not by sight [ living our lives in a manner consistent with our confident belief in God ’ s promises ] —
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	8	we are [ as I was saying ] of good courage and confident hope , and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore , whether we are at home [ on earth ] or away from home [ and with Him ] , it is our [ constant ] ambition to be pleasing to Him .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we [ believers will be called to account and ] must all appear before the [ a ] judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may be repaid for what has been done in the body , whether good or [ b ] bad [ that is , each will be held responsible for his actions , purposes , goals , motives—the use or misuse of his time , opportunities and abilities ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Therefore , since we know the fear of the Lord [ and understand the importance of obedience and worship ] , we persuade people [ to be reconciled to Him ] . But we are plainly known to God [ He knows everything about us ] ; and I hope that we are plainly known also in your consciences [ your God-given discernment ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not commending ourselves to you again , but are giving you an occasion to be [ rightfully ] proud of us , so that you will have an answer for those who take pride in [ outward ] appearances [ the virtues they pretend to have ] rather than what is [ actually ] in heart .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are out of our mind [ just unstable fanatics as some critics say ] , it is for God ; if we are in our right mind , it is for your benefit .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ controls and compels us , because we have concluded this , that One died for all , therefore all died ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	15	and He died for all , so that all those who live would no longer live for themselves , but for Him who died and was raised for their sake .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So from now on we regard no one from a human point of view [ according to worldly standards and values ] . Though we have known Christ from a human point of view , now we no longer know Him in this way .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ [ that is , grafted in , joined to Him by faith in Him as Savior ] , he is a new creature [ reborn and renewed by the Holy Spirit ] ; the old things [ the previous moral and spiritual condition ] have passed away . Behold , new things have come [ because spiritual awakening brings a new life ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	18	But all these things are from God , who reconciled us to Himself through Christ [ making us acceptable to Him ] and gave us the ministry of reconciliation [ so that by our example we might bring others to Him ] ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	19	that is , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself , not counting people ’ s sins against them [ but canceling them ] . And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation [ that is , restoration to favor with God ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God were making His appeal through us ; we [ as Christ ’ s representatives ] plead with you on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	5	21	He made Christ who knew no sin to [ judicially ] be sin on our behalf , so that in Him we would become the righteousness of God [ that is , we would be made acceptable to Him and placed in a right relationship with Him by His gracious lovingkindness ] . Footnotes -

AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	6	in purity and sincerity , in knowledge and spiritual insight , in patience , in kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in genuine love ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	3	we put no obstruction in anyone ’ s path , so that the ministry will not be discredited ,

AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	5	in beatings , in imprisonments , in riots , in labors , in sleepless nights , in hunger ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	7	in [ speaking ] the word of truth , in the power of God ; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [ like holding the sword to attack ] and for the left [ like holding the shield to defend ] ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	8	amid glory and dishonor ; by evil report and good report ; branded as deceivers and yet [ vindicated as ] truthful ;

AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	12	There is no limit to our affection for you , but you are limited in your own affection [ for us ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	13	Now in the same way as a fair exchange [ for our love toward you ] —I am speaking as [ I would ] to children—open wide [ your hearts ] to us also .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not be unequally bound together with unbelievers [ do not make mismatched alliances with them , inconsistent with your faith ] . For what partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness ? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness ?
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	15	What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial ( Satan ) ? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
AMP	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ; just as God said : “ I will dwell among them and walk among them ; And I will be their God , and they shall be My people . ( C )

AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	7	And not only by his arrival , but also by [ his account of ] the encouragement which he received in regard to you . He told us about your longing [ for us ] , your mourning [ over sin ] , and how eagerly you took my part and supported me , so that I rejoiced even more .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to condemn you , for I have said before that you are [ nested ] in our hearts [ and you will remain there ] to die together and to live together [ with us ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my confidence in you ; great is my pride and boasting on your behalf . I am filled [ to the brim ] with comfort ; I am overflowing with joy in spite of all our trouble .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even when we arrived in Macedonia our bodies had no rest , but we were oppressed at every turn—conflicts and disputes without , fears and dread within .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who comforts and encourages the depressed and the disquieted , comforted us by the arrival of Titus .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For even though I did grieve you with my [ a ] letter , I do not regret it [ now ] ; though I did regret it —for I see that the letter hurt you , though only for a little while—
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	9	yet I am glad now , not because you were hurt and made sorry , but because your sorrow led to repentance [ and you turned back to God ] ; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel , so that you might not suffer loss in anything on our account .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For [ godly ] sorrow that is in accord with the will of God produces a repentance without regret , leading to salvation ; but worldly sorrow [ the hopeless sorrow of those who do not believe ] produces death .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For [ you can look back and ] see what an earnestness and authentic concern this godly sorrow has produced in you : what vindication of yourselves [ against charges that you tolerate sin ] , what indignation [ at sin ] , what fear [ of offending God ] , what longing [ for righteousness and justice ] , what passion [ to do what is right ] , what readiness to punish [ those who sin and those who tolerate sin ] ! At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in the matter .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	12	So even though I wrote to you [ as I did ] , it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended , but in order to make evident to you before God how earnestly you do care for us [ and your willingness to accept our authority ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	13	It is for this reason that we are comforted and encouraged . And in addition to our comfort , we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus , because you have refreshed his spirit .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted to him at all concerning you , I was not disappointed . But just as everything we ever said to you was true , so our boasting [ about you ] to Titus has proved true also .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	15	His affection is greater than ever as he remembers the obedience [ to his guidance ] that all of you exhibited , and how you received him with the greatest respect .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in everything I have [ perfect ] confidence in you . Footnotes -

AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not saying this as a command [ to dictate to you ] , but to prove , by [ pointing out ] the enthusiasm of others , the sincerity of your love as well .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For I testify that according to their ability , and beyond their ability , they gave voluntarily ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	4	begging us insistently for the privilege of participating in the service for [ the support of ] the saints [ in Jerusalem ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	5	Not only [ did they give materially ] as we had hoped , but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [ as His representatives ] by the will of God [ disregarding their personal interests and giving as much as they possibly could ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus that , as he began it , he should also complete this gracious work among you as well .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But just as you excel in everything , [ and lead the way ] in faith , in speech , in knowledge , in genuine concern , and in your love for us , see that you excel in this gracious work [ of giving ] also .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you are recognizing [ more clearly ] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [ His astonishing kindness , His generosity , His gracious favor ] , that though He was rich , yet for your sake He became poor , so that by His poverty you might become rich ( abundantly blessed ) .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	10	I give you my opinion in this matter : this is to your advantage , who were the first to begin a year ago not only to take action [ to help the believers in Jerusalem ] , but also [ the first ] to desire to do it .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now finish this , so that your eagerness in desiring it may be equaled by your completion of it , according to your ability .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the eagerness [ to give ] is there , it is acceptable according to what one has , not according to what he does not have .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For it is not [ intended ] that others be relieved [ of their responsibility ] and that you be [ a ] burdened [ unfairly ] , but [ b ] that there be equality [ in sharing the burden ] —
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	14	at this present time your surplus [ over necessities ] is going to supply their need , so that [ at some other time ] their surplus may be given to supply your need , that there may be equality ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	15	as it is written [ in Scripture ] , “ He who gathered much did not have too much , and he who gathered little did not lack. ” ( A )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God who puts the same genuine concern for you in the heart of Titus .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For Titus not only accepted our appeal , but was so very interested in you that he has gone to visit you of his own accord .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent along with him the [ c ] brother who is praised in the gospel [ ministry ] throughout all the churches ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	19	and not only this , but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in regard to this gracious offering which we are administering for the glory of the Lord Himself , and to show our eagerness [ as believers to help one another ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We are taking precaution so that no one will [ find anything with which to ] discredit us in our administration of this generous gift .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written and forever remains written , “ He [ the benevolent and generous person ] scattered abroad , he gave to the poor , His righteousness endures forever ! ” ( B )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Still , I am sending the brothers [ on to you ] , so that our pride in you may not be an empty boast in this case , and so that you may be prepared , just as I told them you would be ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	4	otherwise , if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared , we—to say nothing of yourselves—will be humiliated for being so confident .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	5	That is why I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you [ before I come ] and make arrangements in advance for this generous , previously promised gift of yours , so that it would be ready , not as something extorted [ or wrung out of you ] , but as a [ voluntary and ] generous gift .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Now [ remember ] this : he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and he who sows [ b ] generously [ that blessings may come to others ] will also reap [ c ] generously [ and be blessed ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Let each one give [ thoughtfully and with purpose ] just as he has decided in his heart , not grudgingly or under compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver [ and delights in the one whose heart is in his gift ] . ( A )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace [ every favor and earthly blessing ] come in abundance to you , so that you may always [ under all circumstances , regardless of the need ] have complete sufficiency in everything [ being completely self-sufficient in Him ] , and have an abundance for every good work and act of charity .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now He who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed for sowing [ that is , your resources ] and increase the harvest of your righteousness [ which shows itself in active goodness , kindness , and love ] . ( C )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	11	You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous , and this [ generosity , administered ] through us is producing thanksgiving to God [ from those who benefit ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the ministry of this service ( offering ) is not only supplying the needs of the saints ( God ’ s people ) , but is also overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Because of this act of ministry , [ d ] they will glorify God for your obedience to the gospel of Christ which you confess , as well as for your generous participation [ in this gift ] for them and for all [ the other believers in need ] ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	9	14	and they also long for you while they pray on your behalf , because of the surpassing measure of God ’ s grace [ His undeserved favor , mercy , and blessing which is revealed ] in you .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh [ as mortal men ] , we are not carrying on our [ spiritual ] warfare according to the flesh and using the weapons of man .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	4	The weapons of our warfare are not physical [ weapons of flesh and blood ] . Our weapons are divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	5	We are destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the [ true ] knowledge of God , and we are taking every thought and purpose captive to the obedience of Christ ,

AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You are looking [ only ] at the outward appearance of things . If anyone is confident that he is Christ ’ s , he should reflect and consider this , that just as he is Christ ’ s , so too are we .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even though I boast rather freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up and not for destroying you , I will not be ashamed [ of the truth ] ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	9	nor do I want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such people realize that what we say by word in letters when we are absent , is the same as what we are in action when present .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	12	We do not have the audacity to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with some who [ supply testimonials to ] commend themselves . When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , they lack wisdom and behave like fools .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	13	We , on the other hand , will not boast beyond our proper limit , but [ will keep ] within the [ b ] limits of our commission ( territory , authority ) which God has granted to us as a measure , which reaches and includes even you .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	14	We are not overstepping the limits of our province , as if we did not [ legitimately ] reach to you , for we were the [ very ] first to come even as far as you with the good news of Christ .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	15	We do not go beyond our proper limit , boasting in the work of other men , but we have the hope that as your faith [ in Christ and His divine power ] continues to grow , our field among you may be greatly expanded [ but still within the limits of our commission ] ,
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	16	so that we may preach the gospel even in the lands beyond you , but not to boast in work already accomplished in another one ’ s field of activity .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	10	17	However , “ Let him who boasts boast in the Lord. ” ( A )

AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why ? Because I do not love you [ or wish you well , or have regard for your welfare ] ? God knows [ that I do ] !
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid that , even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning , your minds may be corrupted and led away from the simplicity of [ your sincere and ] pure devotion to Christ . ( B )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For [ you seem willing to allow it ] if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached , or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received , or a different gospel from the one you accepted . You tolerate all this beautifully [ welcoming the deception ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	5	Yet I consider myself in no way inferior to the [ so-called ] [ a ] super-apostles .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But even if I am unskilled in speaking , yet I am not [ untrained ] in [ b ] knowledge [ I know what I am talking about ] ; but we have made this evident to you in every way , in all things .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or did I [ perhaps ] sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted and honored , because I preached God ’ s gospel to you [ c ] free of charge ?

AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , my boast [ of independence ] will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia ( southern Greece ) .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I am doing I will keep doing , [ for I am determined to keep this independence ] in order to cut off the claim of those who want an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things they brag about .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such men are counterfeit apostles , deceitful workers , masquerading as apostles of Christ .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder , since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it is no great surprise if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness , but their end will correspond with their deeds .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I repeat then , let no one think that I am foolish ; but even if you do , at least accept me as foolish , so that I too may boast a little .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I say in this confident boasting , I say not as the Lord would [ with His authority ] , but foolishly .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since many boast [ of worldly things and brag ] about human accomplishments , I will boast too .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	19	[ d ] For you , being so wise , gladly tolerate and accept the foolish [ like me ] !
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you tolerate it if anyone makes you his slave ; or devours you and your possessions ; or takes advantage of you ; or acts presumptuously ; or hits you in the face .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	21	To my shame , I must say , we have been too weak [ in comparison to those pseudo-apostles who take advantage of you ] . But in whatever anyone else dares to boast—I am speaking foolishly—I also dare to boast .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received from the Jews [ e ] thirty-nine lashes . ( D )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods , once I was stoned . Three times I was shipwrecked , a night and a day I have spent adrift on the sea ;

AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	27	in labor and hardship , often unable to sleep , in hunger and thirst , often [ driven to ] fasting [ for lack of food ] , in cold and exposure [ without adequate clothing ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides those external things , there is the daily [ inescapable ] pressure of my concern for all the churches .

AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	7	Because of the surpassing greatness and extraordinary nature of the revelations [ which I received from God ] , for this reason , to keep me from thinking of myself as important , a thorn in the flesh was given to me , a messenger of Satan , to torment and harass me—to keep me from exalting myself ! ( B )
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might leave me ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	9	but He has said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you [ My lovingkindness and My mercy are more than enough—always available—regardless of the situation ] ; for [ My ] power is being perfected [ and is completed and shows itself most effectively ] in [ your ] weakness. ” Therefore , I will all the more gladly boast in my weaknesses , so that the power of Christ [ may completely enfold me and ] may dwell in me .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	10	So I am well pleased with weaknesses , with insults , with distresses , with persecutions , and with difficulties , for the sake of Christ ; for when I am weak [ in human strength ] , then I am strong [ truly able , truly powerful , truly drawing from God ’ s strength ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	11	Now I have become foolish ; you have forced me [ by questioning my apostleship ] . Actually I should have been commended by you [ instead of being treated disdainfully ] , for I was not inferior to those [ d ] super-apostles , even if I am nobody .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches , except [ for the fact ] that I did not burden you [ with my financial support ] ? Forgive me [ for doing you ] this injustice !
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Now for the third time I am ready to visit you . I will not burden you [ financially ] , because I do not want what is yours [ not your money or your possessions ] , but you . For children are not responsible to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	15	But I will very gladly spend [ my own resources ] and be utterly spent for your souls . If I love you greatly , am I to be loved less [ by you ] ?
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be that as it may , I did not burden you [ with my support ] . But [ some say that ] I was sly and took you by trickery .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I take advantage of you or make any money off you through any of the messengers I sent you ? [ Certainly not ! ]
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to go , and I sent the brother with him . Titus did not take advantage of you , did he ? [ No ! ] Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit and walk in the same steps ? [ Of course ! ]
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	19	All this time you have been thinking that we are [ merely ] defending ourselves to you . It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking [ as one ] in Christ ; and everything , dearly beloved , is to strengthen you [ spiritually ] .
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you not to be as I wish , and that you may find me not as you wish—that perhaps there may be strife , jealousy , angry tempers , disputes , slander , gossip , arrogance and disorder ;
AMP	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you , and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity , sexual immorality and decadence which they formerly practiced . Footnotes -

AMP	Galatians	1	11	For I want you to know , [ d ] believers , that the gospel which was preached by me is not man ’ s gospel [ it is not a human invention , patterned after any human concept ] .
AMP	Galatians	1	12	For indeed I did not receive it from man , nor was I taught it , but I received it through a [ direct ] revelation of Jesus Christ .
AMP	Galatians	1	13	You have heard of my career and former manner of life in Judaism , how I used to hunt down and persecute the church of God extensively and [ with fanatical zeal ] tried [ my best ] to destroy it .

AMP	Galatians	1	15	But when God , who had chosen me and set me apart before I was born , and called me through His grace , was pleased ( A )
AMP	Galatians	1	16	to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles [ as the good news—the way of salvation ] , I did not immediately consult with [ e ] anyone [ for guidance regarding God ’ s call and His revelation to me ] .
AMP	Galatians	1	17	Nor did I [ even ] go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me ; but I went to Arabia and stayed awhile , and afterward returned once more to Damascus .

AMP	Galatians	1	19	But I did not see any other apostle except James , the [ half ] brother of the Lord .
AMP	Galatians	1	20	( Now in what I am writing to you , I assure you as if I were standing before God that I am not lying . )
AMP	Galatians	1	21	Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
AMP	Galatians	1	22	And I was still unknown by sight to the churches which were in Christ in Judea ( Jerusalem and the surrounding region ) ;
AMP	Galatians	1	23	they only kept hearing , “ He who used to persecute us is now preaching the [ good news of the ] faith which he once was trying to destroy. ”

AMP	Galatians	2	3	But [ all went well , for ] not even Titus , who was with me , was compelled [ as some had anticipated ] to be circumcised , despite the fact that he was a Greek .
AMP	Galatians	2	4	My concern was because of the [ b ] false brothers [ those people masquerading as Christians ] who had been secretly smuggled in [ to the community of believers ] . They had slipped in to spy on the freedom which we have in Christ Jesus , in order to bring us back into bondage [ under the Law of Moses ] .
AMP	Galatians	2	5	But we did not yield to them even for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel would continue to remain with you [ in its purity ] .
AMP	Galatians	2	6	But from those who were of high reputation ( whatever they were—in terms of individual importance—makes no difference to me ; God shows no partiality—He is not impressed with the positions that people hold nor does He recognize distinctions such as fame or power ) —well , those who were of reputation contributed nothing to me [ that is , they had nothing to add to my gospel message nor did they impose any new requirements on me ] . ( A )
AMP	Galatians	2	7	But on the contrary , they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised ( Gentiles ) , just as Peter had been [ entrusted to proclaim the gospel ] to the circumcised ( Jews ) ;
AMP	Galatians	2	8	( for He who worked effectively for Peter and empowered him in his ministry to the Jews also worked effectively for me and empowered me in my ministry to the Gentiles ) .
AMP	Galatians	2	9	And recognizing the grace [ that God had ] bestowed on me , James and Cephas ( Peter ) and John , who were reputed to be pillars [ of the Jerusalem church ] , gave to me and Barnabas the [ c ] right hand of fellowship , so that we could go to the Gentiles [ with their blessing ] and they to the circumcised ( Jews ) .
AMP	Galatians	2	10	They asked only [ one thing ] , that we remember the poor , the very thing I was also eager to do . Peter ( Cephas ) Opposed by Paul
AMP	Galatians	2	11	Now when Cephas ( Peter ) came to Antioch , I opposed him face to face [ about his conduct there ] , because he stood condemned [ by his own actions ] .
AMP	Galatians	2	12	Before certain men came from James , he used to eat [ his meals ] with the Gentiles ; but when the men [ from Jerusalem ] arrived , he began to withdraw and separate himself [ from the Gentile believers ] , because he was afraid of those from the [ d ] circumcision .
AMP	Galatians	2	13	The rest of the Jews joined him in this hypocrisy [ ignoring their knowledge that Jewish and Gentile Christians were united , under the new covenant , into one faith ] , with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy .
AMP	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they were not being straightforward about the truth of the gospel , I told Cephas ( Peter ) in front of everyone , “ If you , being a Jew , live [ as you have been living ] like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how is it that you are [ now virtually ] forcing the Gentiles to live like Jews [ if they want to eat with you ] ? ”
AMP	Galatians	2	15	[ I went on to say ] “ We are Jews by birth and not sinners from among the Gentiles ;
AMP	Galatians	2	16	yet we know that a man is not [ e ] justified [ and placed in right standing with God ] by works of the Law , but [ only ] through faith in [ God ’ s beloved Son , ] Christ Jesus . And even we [ as Jews ] have believed in Christ Jesus , so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the Law . By observing the Law no one will ever be justified [ declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty ] . ( B )
AMP	Galatians	2	17	But if , while we seek to be justified in Christ [ by faith ] , we ourselves are found to be sinners , does that make Christ an advocate or promoter of our sin ? Certainly not !
AMP	Galatians	2	18	For if I [ or anyone else should ] rebuild [ through word or by practice ] what I once tore down [ the belief that observing the Law is essential for salvation ] , I prove myself to be a transgressor .
AMP	Galatians	2	19	For through the Law I died to the Law and its demands on me [ because salvation is provided through the death and resurrection of Christ ] , so that I might [ from now on ] live to God .
AMP	Galatians	2	20	I have been crucified with Christ [ that is , in Him I have shared His crucifixion ] ; it is no longer I who live , but Christ lives in me .

AMP	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish and senseless ? Having begun [ your new life by faith ] with the Spirit , are you now being perfected and reaching spiritual maturity by the flesh [ that is , by your own works and efforts to keep the Law ] ?
AMP	Galatians	3	2	This is all I want to ask of you : did you receive the [ Holy ] Spirit as the result of obeying [ the requirements of ] the Law , or was it the result of hearing [ the message of salvation and ] with faith [ believing it ] ?
AMP	Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so many things and experienced so much all for nothing—if indeed it was all for nothing ?
AMP	Galatians	3	5	So then , does He who supplies you with His [ marvelous Holy ] Spirit and works miracles among you , do it as a result of the works of the Law [ which you perform ] , or because you [ believe confidently in the message which you ] heard with faith ?
AMP	Galatians	3	6	Just as Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , [ as conformity to God ’ s will and purpose—so it is with you also ] . ( A )
AMP	Galatians	3	7	So understand that it is the people who live by faith [ with confidence in the power and goodness of God ] who are [ the true ] sons of [ a ] Abraham .
AMP	Galatians	3	8	The Scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , proclaimed the good news [ of the Savior ] to Abraham in advance [ with this promise ] , saying , “ In you shall all the nations be blessed. ” ( B )
AMP	Galatians	3	9	So then those who are people of faith [ whether Jew or Gentile ] are blessed and favored by God [ and declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty , and placed in right standing with Him ] along with Abraham , the believer .
AMP	Galatians	3	10	For all who depend on the Law [ seeking justification and salvation by obedience to the Law and the observance of rituals ] are under a curse ; for it is written , “ Cursed ( condemned to destruction ) is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law , so as to practice them. ” ( C )
AMP	Galatians	3	11	Now it is clear that no one is justified [ that is , declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty , and placed in right standing ] before God by the Law , for “ The righteous ( the just , the upright ) shall live by faith. ” ( D )
AMP	Galatians	3	12	But the Law does not rest on or require faith [ it has nothing to do with faith ] , but [ instead , the Law ] says , “ He who practices them [ the things prescribed by the Law ] shall live by them [ instead of faith ] . ” ( E )
AMP	Galatians	3	13	Christ purchased our freedom and redeemed us from the curse of the Law and its condemnation by becoming a curse for us—for it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who hangs [ crucified ] on a tree ( cross ) ” — ( F )
AMP	Galatians	3	14	in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might also come to the Gentiles , so that we would all receive [ the realization of ] the promise of the [ Holy ] Spirit through faith . Intent of the Law
AMP	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , I speak in terms of human relations : even though a last will and testament is just a human covenant , yet when it has been signed and made legally binding , no one sets it aside or adds to it [ modifying it in some way ] .
AMP	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises [ in the covenants ] were decreed to Abraham and to his seed . God does not say , “ And to seeds ( descendants , heirs ) , ” as if [ referring ] to many [ persons ] , but as to one , “ And to your Seed , ” who is [ none other than ] Christ . ( G )
AMP	Galatians	3	17	This is what I mean : the Law , which came into existence four hundred and thirty years later [ after the covenant concerning the coming Messiah ] , does not and can not invalidate the covenant previously established by God , so as to abolish the promise . ( H )

AMP	Galatians	3	19	Why , then , the Law [ what was its purpose ] ? It was added [ after the promise to Abraham , to reveal to people their guilt ] because of transgressions [ that is , to make people conscious of the sinfulness of sin ] , and [ the Law ] was ordained through angels and delivered to Israel by the hand of a mediator [ Moses , the mediator between God and Israel , to be in effect ] until the Seed would come to whom the promise had been made .
AMP	Galatians	3	20	Now the mediator or go-between [ in a transaction ] is not [ needed ] for just one party ; whereas God is only one [ and was the only One giving the promise to Abraham , but the Law was a contract between two , God and Israel ; its validity depended on both ] .
AMP	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God ? Certainly not ! For if a system of law had been given which could impart life , then righteousness ( right standing with God ) would actually have been based on law .
AMP	Galatians	3	22	But the Scripture has imprisoned [ b ] everyone [ everything—the entire world ] under sin , so that [ the inheritance , the blessing of salvation ] which was promised through faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe [ in Him and acknowledge Him as God ’ s precious Son ] .
AMP	Galatians	3	23	Now before faith came , we were kept in custody under the Law , [ perpetually ] imprisoned [ in preparation ] for the faith that was destined to be revealed ,
AMP	Galatians	3	24	with the result that the Law has become our tutor and our disciplinarian to guide us to Christ , so that we may be [ c ] justified [ that is , declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty , and placed in right standing with God ] by faith .
AMP	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under [ the control and authority of ] a tutor and disciplinarian .
AMP	Galatians	3	26	For you [ who are born-again have been reborn from above—spiritually transformed , renewed , sanctified and ] are all children of God [ set apart for His purpose with full rights and privileges ] through faith in Christ Jesus .
AMP	Galatians	3	27	For all of you who were baptized into Christ [ into a spiritual union with the Christ , the Anointed ] have clothed yourselves with Christ [ that is , you have taken on His characteristics and values ] .
AMP	Galatians	3	28	There is [ now no distinction in regard to salvation ] neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female ; for you [ who believe ] are all one in Christ Jesus [ no one can claim a spiritual superiority ] . ( I )
AMP	Galatians	3	29	And if you belong to Christ [ if you are in Him ] , then you are Abraham ’ s descendants , and [ spiritual ] heirs according to [ God ’ s ] promise .

AMP	Galatians	4	3	So also we [ whether Jews or Gentiles ] , when we were children ( spiritually immature ) , were kept like slaves under the elementary [ man-made religious or philosophical ] teachings of the world .
AMP	Galatians	4	5	so that He might redeem and liberate those who were under the Law , that we [ who believe ] might be adopted as sons [ as God ’ s children with all rights as fully grown members of a family ] . ( A )
AMP	Galatians	4	6	And because you [ really ] are [ His ] sons , God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts , crying out , [ a ] “ Abba ! Father ! ”
AMP	Galatians	4	7	Therefore you are no longer a slave ( bond-servant ) , but a son ; and if a son , then also an heir through [ the gracious act of ] God [ through Christ ] .
AMP	Galatians	4	8	But at that time , when you did not know [ the true ] God and were unacquainted with Him , you [ Gentiles ] were slaves to those [ pagan ] things which by [ their very ] nature were not and could not be gods at all .
AMP	Galatians	4	9	Now , however , since you have come to know [ the true ] God [ through personal experience ] , or rather to be known by God , how is it that you are turning back again to the weak and worthless elemental principles [ of religions and philosophies ] , to which you want to be enslaved all over again ?
AMP	Galatians	4	10	[ For example , ] you observe [ particular ] days and months and seasons and years .
AMP	Galatians	4	11	I fear for you , that perhaps I have labored [ to the point of exhaustion ] over you in vain .
AMP	Galatians	4	12	Believers , I beg of you , become as I am [ free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances ] , for I have become as you are [ a Gentile ] . You did me no wrong [ when I first came to you ; do not do it now ] .
AMP	Galatians	4	13	On the contrary , you know that it was because of a physical illness that I [ remained and ] preached the gospel to you the first time ;
AMP	Galatians	4	14	and even though my physical condition was a trial to you , you did not regard it with contempt , or scorn and reject me ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus Himself .
AMP	Galatians	4	15	What then has become of that sense of blessing and the joy that you once had [ from your salvation and your relationship with Christ ] ? For I testify of you that , if possible , you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me [ [ b ] to replace mine ] .
AMP	Galatians	4	16	So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth ?
AMP	Galatians	4	17	These men [ the Judaizers ] eagerly seek you [ to entrap you with honeyed words and attention , to win you over to their philosophy ] , not honorably [ for their purpose is not honorable or worthy of consideration ] . They want to isolate you [ from us who oppose them ] so that you will seek them .
AMP	Galatians	4	18	Now it is always pleasant to be eagerly sought after [ provided that it is ] for a good purpose , and not just when I am with you [ seeking you myself—but beware of the others doing it ] .
AMP	Galatians	4	19	My little children , for whom I am again in [ the pains of ] labor until Christ is [ completely and permanently ] formed within you—
AMP	Galatians	4	20	how I wish that I were with you now and could change my tone , because I am perplexed in regard to you . Bond and Free
AMP	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who are bent on being under the Law , do you not listen to [ what ] the Law [ really says ] ?
AMP	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman [ Hagar ] and one by the free woman [ Sarah ] . ( B )
AMP	Galatians	4	23	But the child of the slave woman was born according to the flesh and had an ordinary birth , while the son of the free woman was born in fulfillment of the promise .
AMP	Galatians	4	24	Now these facts are about to be used [ by me ] as an allegory [ that is , I will illustrate by using them ] : for these women can represent two covenants : one [ covenant originated ] from Mount Sinai [ where the Law was given ] that bears children [ destined ] for slavery ; she is Hagar .
AMP	Galatians	4	25	Now Hagar is ( represents ) Mount Sinai in Arabia and she corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery with her children .
AMP	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above [ that is , the way of faith , represented by Sarah ] is free ; she is our mother .
AMP	Galatians	4	27	For it is written [ in the Scriptures ] , “ Rejoice , o barren woman who has not given birth ; Break forth into a [ joyful ] shout , you who are not in labor ; For the desolate woman has many more children Than she who has a husband. ” ( C )
AMP	Galatians	4	28	And we , [ believing ] brothers and sisters , like Isaac , are children [ not merely of physical descent , like Ishmael , but are children born ] of promise [ born miraculously ] .
AMP	Galatians	4	29	But as at that time the child [ of ordinary birth ] born according to the flesh persecuted the son who was born according to [ the promise and working of ] the Spirit , so it is now also . ( D )
AMP	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Cast out the bondwoman [ Hagar ] and her son [ Ishmael ] , For never shall the son of the bondwoman be heir and share the inheritance with the son of the free woman. ” ( E )
AMP	Galatians	4	31	So then , believers , we [ who are born again—reborn from above—spiritually transformed , renewed , and set apart for His purpose ] are not children of a slave woman [ the natural ] , but of the free woman [ the supernatural ] .

AMP	Galatians	5	5	For we [ not relying on the Law but ] through the [ strength and power of the Holy ] Spirit , by faith , are waiting [ confidently ] for the hope of righteousness [ the completion of our salvation ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	2	Notice , it is I , Paul , who tells you that if you receive circumcision [ as a supposed requirement of salvation ] , Christ will be of no benefit to you [ for you will lack the faith in Christ that is necessary for salvation ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	3	Once more I solemnly affirm to every man who receives circumcision [ as a supposed requirement of salvation ] , that he is under obligation and required to keep the whole Law .
AMP	Galatians	5	4	You have been severed from Christ , if you seek to be [ a ] justified [ that is , declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty , and placed in right standing with God ] through the Law ; you have fallen from grace [ for you have lost your grasp on God ’ s unmerited favor and blessing ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	6	For [ if we are ] in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything , but only faith activated and expressed and working through love .
AMP	Galatians	5	7	You were running [ the race ] well ; who has interfered and prevented you from obeying the truth ?
AMP	Galatians	5	8	This [ deceptive ] persuasion is not from Him who called you [ to freedom in Christ ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	9	A little [ b ] leaven [ a slight inclination to error , or a few false teachers ] leavens the whole batch [ it perverts the concept of faith and misleads the church ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view [ contrary to mine on the matter ] ; but the one who is disturbing you , whoever he is , will have to bear the penalty .
AMP	Galatians	5	11	But as for me , [ c ] brothers , if I am still preaching circumcision [ as I had done before I met Christ ; and as [ d ] some accuse me of doing now , as necessary for salvation ] , why am I still being persecuted [ by Jews ] ? In that case the stumbling block of the cross [ to unbelieving Jews ] has been abolished .
AMP	Galatians	5	12	I wish that those who are troubling you [ by teaching that circumcision is necessary for salvation ] would even [ go all the way and ] castrate themselves !
AMP	Galatians	5	13	For you , my brothers , were called to freedom ; only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the [ e ] sinful nature ( worldliness , selfishness ) , but through [ f ] love serve and seek the best for one another .
AMP	Galatians	5	14	For the whole Law [ concerning human relationships ] is fulfilled in one precept , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself [ that is , you shall have an unselfish concern for others and do things for their benefit ] . ” ( A )
AMP	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another [ in bickering and strife ] , watch out that you [ along with your entire fellowship ] are not consumed by one another .
AMP	Galatians	5	16	But I say , walk habitually in the [ Holy ] Spirit [ seek Him and be responsive to His guidance ] , and then you will certainly not carry out the desire of the [ g ] sinful nature [ which responds impulsively without regard for God and His precepts ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	17	For the sinful nature has its desire which is opposed to the Spirit , and the [ desire of the ] Spirit opposes the [ h ] sinful nature ; for these [ two , the sinful nature and the Spirit ] are in direct opposition to each other [ continually in conflict ] , so that you [ as believers ] do not [ always ] do whatever [ good things ] you want to do .
AMP	Galatians	5	18	But if you are guided and led by the Spirit , you are not subject to the Law .
AMP	Galatians	5	19	Now the practices of the [ i ] sinful nature are clearly evident : they are sexual immorality , impurity , sensuality ( total irresponsibility , lack of self-control ) ,
AMP	Galatians	5	20	[ j ] idolatry , [ k ] sorcery , hostility , strife , jealousy , fits of anger , disputes , dissensions , factions [ that promote heresies ] ,
AMP	Galatians	5	21	envy , drunkenness , riotous behavior , and other things like these . I warn you beforehand , just as I did previously , that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
AMP	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit [ the result of His presence within us ] is love [ unselfish concern for others ] , joy , [ inner ] peace , patience [ not the ability to wait , but how we act while waiting ] , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
AMP	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , self-control . Against such things there is no law .
AMP	Galatians	5	24	And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the [ l ] sinful nature together with its passions and appetites .
AMP	Galatians	5	25	If we [ claim to ] live by the [ Holy ] Spirit , we must also walk by the Spirit [ with personal integrity , godly character , and moral courage—our conduct empowered by the Holy Spirit ] .
AMP	Galatians	5	26	We must not become conceited , challenging or provoking one another , envying one another .

The books of Ephesians , Philippians , Colossians , and Philemon are believed to have been written by Paul while he was a prisoner under house arrest in Rome ( a.d. 60-62 ) ( cf 6:20 ) . - Ephesians 1:3 In Greek this passage ( vv 3-14 ) , also referred to as a doxology , is one sentence . - Ephesians 1:11 Or our destiny . - Ephesians 1:14 Or down payment . - Ephesians 1:18 In the NT the word “ hope ” expresses a cherished desire along with the confident assurance of obtaining that which is longed for . - Ephesians 1:18 See note v

You were following the ways of this world [ influenced by this present age ] , in accordance with the prince of the power of the air ( Satan ) , the spirit who is now at work in the disobedient [ the unbelieving , who fight against the purposes of God ] .
AMP	Ephesians	2	3	Among these [ unbelievers ] we all once lived in the passions of our flesh [ our behavior governed by the sinful self ] , indulging the desires of [ a ] human nature [ without the Holy Spirit ] and [ the impulses ] of the [ sinful ] mind . We were , by nature , children [ under the sentence ] of [ God ’ s ] wrath , just like the rest [ of mankind ] .
AMP	Ephesians	2	4	But God , being [ so very ] rich in mercy , because of His great and wonderful love with which He loved us ,
AMP	Ephesians	2	5	even when we were [ spiritually ] dead and separated from Him because of our sins , He made us [ spiritually ] alive together with Christ ( for by His grace—His undeserved favor and mercy—you have been saved from God ’ s judgment ) . ( A )
AMP	Ephesians	2	6	And He raised us up together with Him [ when we believed ] , and seated us with Him in the heavenly places , [ because we are ] in Christ Jesus ,
AMP	Ephesians	2	7	[ and He did this ] so that in the ages to come He might [ clearly ] show the immeasurable and unsurpassed riches of His grace in [ His ] kindness toward us in Christ Jesus [ by providing for our redemption ] .
AMP	Ephesians	2	8	For it is by grace [ God ’ s remarkable compassion and favor drawing you to Christ ] that you have been saved [ actually delivered from judgment and given eternal life ] through faith . And this [ salvation ] is not of yourselves [ not through your own effort ] , but it is the [ undeserved , gracious ] gift of God ;
AMP	Ephesians	2	9	not as a result of [ your ] works [ nor your attempts to keep the Law ] , so that no one will [ be able to ] boast or take credit in any way [ for his salvation ] .
AMP	Ephesians	2	10	For we are His workmanship [ His own master work , a work of art ] , created in Christ Jesus [ reborn from above—spiritually transformed , renewed , ready to be used ] for good works , which God prepared [ for us ] beforehand [ taking paths which He set ] , so that we would walk in them [ living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us ] . ( B )
AMP	Ephesians	2	11	Therefore , remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth , who are called “ Uncircumcision ” by those who called themselves “ Circumcision , ” [ itself a mere mark ] which is made in the flesh by human hands—
AMP	Ephesians	2	12	remember that at that time you were separated from Christ [ excluded from any relationship with Him ] , alienated from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers to the covenants of promise [ with no share in the sacred Messianic promise and without knowledge of God ’ s agreements ] , having no hope [ in His promise ] and [ living ] in the world without God .
AMP	Ephesians	2	13	But now [ at this very moment ] in Christ Jesus you who once were [ so very ] far away [ from God ] have been brought near [ b ] by the blood of Christ .
AMP	Ephesians	2	14	For He Himself is our peace and our bond of unity . He who made both groups— [ Jews and Gentiles ] —into one body and broke down the barrier , the dividing wall [ of spiritual antagonism between us ] ,
AMP	Ephesians	2	15	by abolishing in His [ own crucified ] flesh the hostility caused by the Law with its commandments contained in ordinances [ which He satisfied ] ; so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man , thereby establishing peace .
AMP	Ephesians	2	16	And [ that He ] might reconcile them both [ Jew and Gentile , united ] in one body to God through the cross , thereby putting to death the hostility .
AMP	Ephesians	2	17	And He came and preached the good news of peace to you [ Gentiles ] who were far away , and peace to those [ Jews ] who were near . ( C )
AMP	Ephesians	2	18	For it is through Him that we both have a [ direct ] way of approach in one Spirit to the Father .
AMP	Ephesians	2	19	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens [ outsiders without rights of citizenship ] , but you are fellow citizens with the saints ( God ’ s people ) , and are [ members ] of God ’ s household ,
AMP	Ephesians	2	20	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , with Christ Jesus Himself as the [ chief ] Cornerstone ,
AMP	Ephesians	2	21	in whom the whole structure is joined together , and it continues [ to increase ] growing into a holy temple in the Lord [ a sanctuary dedicated , set apart , and sacred to the presence of the Lord ] .

AMP	Ephesians	3	2	assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God ’ s grace that was entrusted to me [ to share with you ] for your benefit ;
AMP	Ephesians	3	4	By referring to this , when you read it you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	5	which in other generations was not disclosed to mankind , as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the [ Holy ] Spirit ;
AMP	Ephesians	3	6	[ it is this : ] that the Gentiles are now joint heirs [ with the Jews ] and members of the same body , and joint partakers [ sharing ] in the [ same divine ] promise in Christ Jesus through [ their faith in ] the good news [ of salvation ] .
AMP	Ephesians	3	7	Of this [ gospel ] I was made a minister by the gift of God ’ s grace given me through the working of His power .
AMP	Ephesians	3	8	To me , [ though I am ] the very least of all the saints ( God ’ s people ) , this grace [ which is undeserved ] was graciously given , to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the incomprehensible riches of Christ [ that spiritual wealth which no one can fully understand ] ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	9	and to make plain [ to everyone ] the plan of the mystery [ regarding the uniting of believing Jews and Gentiles into one body ] which [ until now ] was kept hidden through the ages in [ the mind of ] God who created all things .
AMP	Ephesians	3	10	So now through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God [ in all its countless aspects ] might now be made known [ revealing the mystery ] to the [ angelic ] rulers and authorities in the heavenly places .
AMP	Ephesians	3	11	This is in accordance with [ the terms of ] the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him [ that is , our faith gives us sufficient courage to freely and openly approach God through Christ ] .
AMP	Ephesians	3	13	So I ask you not to lose heart at my sufferings on your behalf , for they are your glory and honor .
AMP	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason [ grasping the greatness of this plan by which Jews and Gentiles are joined together in Christ ] I bow my knees [ in reverence ] before the Father [ of our Lord Jesus Christ ] ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth [ a ] derives its name [ God—the first and ultimate Father ] .
AMP	Ephesians	3	16	May He grant you out of the riches of His glory , to be strengthened and spiritually energized with power through His Spirit in your inner self , [ indwelling your innermost being and personality ] ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	17	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through your faith . And may you , having been [ deeply ] rooted and [ securely ] grounded in love ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	18	be fully capable of comprehending with all the saints ( God ’ s people ) the width and length and height and depth of His love [ fully experiencing that amazing , endless love ] ;
AMP	Ephesians	3	19	and [ that you may come ] to know [ practically , through personal experience ] the love of Christ which far surpasses [ mere ] knowledge [ without experience ] , that you may be filled up [ throughout your being ] to all the fullness of God [ so that you may have the richest experience of God ’ s presence in your lives , completely filled and flooded with God Himself ] .
AMP	Ephesians	3	20	Now to Him who is able to [ carry out His purpose and ] do superabundantly more than all that we dare ask or think [ infinitely beyond our greatest prayers , hopes , or dreams ] , according to His power that is at work within us ,
AMP	Ephesians	3	21	to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever . Amen .

AMP	Ephesians	4	18	for their [ moral ] understanding is darkened and their reasoning is clouded ; [ they are ] alienated and self-banished from the life of God [ with no share in it ; this is ] because of the [ willful ] ignorance and spiritual blindness that is [ deep-seated ] within them , because of the hardness and insensitivity of their heart .
AMP	Ephesians	4	19	And they , [ the ungodly in their spiritual apathy ] , having become callous and unfeeling , have given themselves over [ as prey ] to unbridled sensuality , eagerly craving the practice of every kind of impurity [ that their desires may demand ] .
AMP	Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ in this way !
AMP	Ephesians	4	21	If in fact you have [ really ] heard Him and have been taught by Him , just as truth is in Jesus [ revealed in His life and personified in Him ] ,
AMP	Ephesians	4	22	that , regarding your previous way of life , you put off your old self [ completely discard your former nature ] , which is being corrupted through deceitful desires ,
AMP	Ephesians	4	23	and be continually renewed in the spirit of your mind [ having a fresh , untarnished mental and spiritual attitude ] ,
AMP	Ephesians	4	24	and put on the new self [ the regenerated and renewed nature ] , created in God ’ s image , [ godlike ] in the righteousness and holiness of the truth [ living in a way that expresses to God your gratitude for your salvation ] .
AMP	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , rejecting all falsehood [ whether lying , defrauding , telling half-truths , spreading rumors , any such as these ] , speak truth each one with his neighbor , for we are all parts of one another [ and we are all parts of the body of Christ ] . ( B )

AMP	Ephesians	4	28	The thief [ who has become a believer ] must no longer steal , but instead he must work hard [ making an honest living ] , producing that which is good with his own hands , so that he will have something to share with those in need .
AMP	Ephesians	4	29	Do not let unwholesome [ foul , profane , worthless , vulgar ] words ever come out of your mouth , but only such speech as is good for building up others , according to the need and the occasion , so that it will be a blessing to those who hear [ you speak ] .

AMP	Ephesians	5	33	However , each man among you [ without exception ] is to love his wife as his very own self [ with behavior worthy of respect and esteem , always seeking the best for her with an attitude of lovingkindness ] , and the wife [ must see to it ] that she respects and delights in her husband [ that she notices him and prefers him and treats him with loving concern , treasuring him , honoring him , and holding him dear ] .

Even the philosopher Plato maintained that vision essentially is the process of light forming an image of an object it touches and conveying that image to the eyes . So Paul may mean that what is actually seen is an image composed of light ( like the photographic process ) , and since light is always reliable and its physical properties are constant , nothing exposed to light escapes being revealed .

Footnotes - Ephesians 6:5 Slavery was common in New Testament times ( as well as in ancient Israel ) . One might become a slave through conquest , the commission of a crime , or destitution . Slaves were required to do their masters ’ bidding and work without compensation ( cf Luke 17:7-10 ) . Elsewhere Paul advises slaves not to dwell on their circumstances , and to earn their freedom if they can (
AMP	Ephesians	6	1	Cor 7:21 ) . The admonitions here accurately reflect the slave/master relationship in the Roman Empire ; since they were not compensated , slaves sometimes did only what they had to do to avoid punishment , and masters could be cruel disciplinarians . - Ephesians 6:14 Lit girded your loins , a phrase often found in the Bible , is an urgent call to get ready for immediate action or a coming event . The phrase is related to the type of clothing worn in ancient times . Before any vigorous activity the loose ends of clothing ( tunics , cloaks , mantles , etc . ) had to be gathered up and tucked into the wide band worn around the midsection of the body . The band ( usually about six inches wide ) also served as a kind of pocket or pouch to carry personal items such as a dagger , money or other necessary things . Gird up your mind or gird up your heart are examples of variants of this phrase and call for mental or spiritual preparation for a coming challenge . - Ephesians 6:15 A reference to the Roman soldiers ’ shoes which were studded with hobnails to give them stability on the battlefield . - Ephesians 6:16 Here the Greek word refers to the large Roman soldiers ’ shield designed to protect the entire body . It had an iron frame and was covered in several layers of leather . When soaked in water before a battle the shield could put out the fiery missiles thrown at them by the enemy . - Ephesians 6:18 Lit the saints . - Ephesians 6:23 Lit brethren . Copyright ©

AMP	Philippians	1	10	so that you may learn to recognize and treasure what is excellent [ identifying the best , and distinguishing moral differences ] , and that you may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ [ actually living lives that lead others away from sin ] ;
AMP	Philippians	1	11	filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ , to the glory and praise of God [ so that His glory may be both revealed and recognized ] . The Gospel Is Preached
AMP	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know , [ a ] believers , that what has happened to me [ this imprisonment that was meant to stop me ] has actually served to advance [ the spread of ] the good news [ regarding salvation ] .
AMP	Philippians	1	13	My imprisonment in [ the cause of ] Christ has become common knowledge throughout the whole [ b ] praetorian ( imperial ) guard and to everyone else .
AMP	Philippians	1	14	Because of my chains [ seeing that I am doing well and that God is accomplishing great things ] , most of the [ c ] brothers have renewed confidence in the Lord , and have far more courage to speak the word of God [ concerning salvation ] without fear [ of the consequences , seeing that God can work His good in all circumstances ] .
AMP	Philippians	1	15	Some , it is true , are [ actually ] preaching Christ out of envy and rivalry [ toward me—for no better reason than a competitive spirit or misguided ambition ] , but others out of goodwill and a loyal spirit [ toward me ] .
AMP	Philippians	1	16	The latter [ preach Christ ] out of love , because they know that I have been put here [ by God on purpose ] for the defense of the gospel ;
AMP	Philippians	1	17	but the former preach Christ [ insincerely ] out of selfish ambition [ just self-promotion ] , thinking that they are causing me distress in my imprisonment .
AMP	Philippians	1	18	What then [ does it matter ] ? So long as in every way , whether in pretense [ for self-promotion ] or in all honesty [ to spread the truth ] , Christ is being preached ; and in this I rejoice . Yes , and I will rejoice [ later as well ] ,
AMP	Philippians	1	19	for I know [ with confidence ] that this will turn out for my deliverance and spiritual well-being , through your prayers and the [ superabundant ] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ [ which upholds me ] .
AMP	Philippians	1	20	It is my own eager expectation and hope , that [ looking toward the future ] I will not disgrace myself nor be ashamed in anything , but that with courage and the utmost freedom of speech , even now as always , Christ will be magnified and exalted in my body , whether by life or by death . To Live Is Christ
AMP	Philippians	1	21	For to me , to live is Christ [ He is my source of joy , my reason to live ] and to die is gain [ for I will be with Him in eternity ] .
AMP	Philippians	1	22	If , however , it is to be life here and I am to go on living , this will mean useful and productive service for me ; so I do not know which to choose [ if I am given that choice ] .
AMP	Philippians	1	23	But I am hard-pressed between the two . I have the desire to leave [ this world ] and be with Christ , for that is far , far better ;
AMP	Philippians	1	24	yet to remain in my body is more necessary and essential for your sake .
AMP	Philippians	1	25	Since I am convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith ,
AMP	Philippians	1	26	so that your rejoicing for me may overflow in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again .
AMP	Philippians	1	27	Only [ be sure to ] lead your lives in a manner [ that will be ] worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I do come and see you or remain absent , I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit [ and one purpose ] , with one [ d ] mind striving side by side [ as if in combat ] for the faith of the gospel .
AMP	Philippians	1	28	And in no way be alarmed or intimidated [ in anything ] by your opponents , for such [ constancy and fearlessness on your part ] is a [ clear ] sign [ a proof and a seal ] for them of [ their impending ] destruction , but [ a clear sign ] for you of deliverance and salvation , and that too , from God .
AMP	Philippians	1	29	For you have been granted [ the privilege ] for Christ ’ s sake , not only to believe and confidently trust in Him , but also to suffer for His sake ,
AMP	Philippians	1	30	[ and so you are ] experiencing the same [ kind of ] conflict which [ e ] you saw me endure , and which you hear to be mine now .

AMP	Philippians	2	2	make my joy complete by being of the same mind , having the same [ a ] love [ toward one another ] , knit together in spirit , intent on one purpose [ and living a life that reflects your faith and spreads the gospel—the good news regarding salvation through faith in Christ ] .
AMP	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit [ through factional motives , or strife ] , but with [ an attitude of ] humility [ being neither arrogant nor self-righteous ] , regard others as more important than yourselves .
AMP	Philippians	2	4	Do not merely look out for your own personal interests , but also for the interests of others .
AMP	Philippians	2	5	Have this same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus [ look to Him as your example in selfless humility ] ,
AMP	Philippians	2	6	who , although He existed in the form and unchanging essence of God [ as One with Him , possessing the fullness of all the divine attributes—the entire nature of deity ] , did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped or asserted [ as if He did not already possess it , or was afraid of losing it ] ;
AMP	Philippians	2	7	but emptied Himself [ without renouncing or diminishing His deity , but only temporarily giving up the outward expression of divine equality and His rightful dignity ] by assuming the form of a bond-servant , and being made in the likeness of men [ He became completely human but was without sin , being fully God and fully man ] .
AMP	Philippians	2	8	After He was found in [ terms of His ] outward appearance as a man [ for a divinely-appointed time ] , He humbled Himself [ still further ] by becoming obedient [ to the Father ] to the point of death , even death on a cross .
AMP	Philippians	2	9	For this reason also [ because He obeyed and so completely humbled Himself ] , God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name ,
AMP	Philippians	2	10	so that at the name of Jesus [ b ] every knee shall bow [ in submission ] , of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth , ( A )
AMP	Philippians	2	11	and that every tongue will confess and openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord ( sovereign God ) , to the glory of God the Father .
AMP	Philippians	2	12	So then , my dear ones , just as you have always obeyed [ my instructions with enthusiasm ] , not only in my presence , but now much more in my absence , continue to work out your salvation [ that is , cultivate it , bring it to full effect , actively pursue spiritual maturity ] with awe-inspired fear and trembling [ using serious caution and critical self-evaluation to avoid anything that might offend God or discredit the name of Christ ] .
AMP	Philippians	2	13	For it is [ not your strength , but it is ] [ c ] God who is effectively at work in you , both to will and to work [ that is , strengthening , energizing , and creating in you the longing and the ability to fulfill your purpose ] for His good pleasure .
AMP	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without murmuring or questioning [ the providence of God ] ,
AMP	Philippians	2	15	so that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and guileless , innocent and uncontaminated , children of God without blemish in the midst of a [ morally ] crooked and [ spiritually ] perverted generation , among whom you are seen as bright lights [ beacons shining out clearly ] in the world [ of darkness ] ,
AMP	Philippians	2	16	holding out and offering to everyone the word of life , so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to rejoice greatly because I did not run [ my race ] in vain nor labor without result .
AMP	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am being poured out as a [ d ] drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith [ for preaching the message of salvation ] , still I rejoice and share my joy with you all . ( B )
AMP	Philippians	2	18	You too , rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
AMP	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , so that I may also be encouraged by learning news about you .
AMP	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one else [ like him who is ] so kindred a spirit who will be genuinely concerned for your [ spiritual ] welfare .
AMP	Philippians	2	21	For the others [ who deserted me after my arrest ] all seek [ to advance ] their own interests , not those of Jesus Christ .
AMP	Philippians	2	22	But you know of Timothy ’ s tested worth and his proven character , that he has served with me to advance the gospel like a son serving with his father .
AMP	Philippians	2	23	Therefore , I hope [ that it is His will ] to send him immediately , just as soon as I see how [ e ] my case turns out ;
AMP	Philippians	2	24	and I trust [ confidently ] in the Lord that soon I also will be coming to you .
AMP	Philippians	2	25	However , I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus , [ who has been ] my brother and companion and fellow soldier , who was also sent as your messenger to take care of my needs .
AMP	Philippians	2	26	For he has been longing [ f ] for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick .
AMP	Philippians	2	27	He certainly was sick and close to death . But God had mercy on him , and not only on him but also on me , so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow .
AMP	Philippians	2	28	So I have sent him all the more eagerly so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you .
AMP	Philippians	2	29	Welcome him home in the Lord with great joy , and appreciate and honor men like him ;
AMP	Philippians	2	30	because he came close to death for the work of Christ , risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me [ which distance prevented you from rendering personally ] . Footnotes - Philippians 2:2 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love ( the Greek word agape ) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person , that is , having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another . - Philippians 2:10 All intelligent beings in the universe , whether saved or unsaved , whether in spirit or as mortal mankind , will acknowledge Him . - Philippians 2:13 God supports the believer , but it is the believer ’ s responsibility to do what he has been called by God to do . - Philippians 2:17 The drink offering ( wine ) was required as part of the sacrificial system of the old covenant . - Philippians 2:23 Lit things go with me . This letter to the Philippians was written near the end of Paul ’ s two-year period of imprisonment in Rome . This was the first of his two Roman imprisonments . At this time he was under house arrest and was living in his own rented home . About five years after his release he was imprisoned again . Emperor Nero was actively persecuting the Christians during this period , so Paul was held in the Mamertine dungeon ( Tullianum ) .

AMP	Philippians	3	3	for we [ who are born-again have been reborn from above—spiritually transformed , renewed , set apart for His purpose and ] are the true circumcision , who worship in the Spirit of God and glory and take pride and exult in Christ Jesus and place no confidence [ in what we have or who we are ] in the flesh—
AMP	Philippians	3	2	Look out for the [ b ] dogs [ the Judaizers , the legalists ] , look out for the troublemakers , look out for the [ c ] false circumcision [ those who claim circumcision is necessary for salvation ] ;
AMP	Philippians	3	4	though I myself might have [ some grounds for ] confidence in the flesh [ if I were pursuing salvation by works ] . If anyone else thinks that he has reason to be confident in the flesh [ that is , in his own efforts to achieve salvation ] , I have far more :
AMP	Philippians	3	5	circumcised when I was eight days old , of the nation of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of Hebrews [ an exemplary Hebrew ] ; as to the [ observance of the ] Law , a Pharisee ;
AMP	Philippians	3	6	as to my zeal [ for Jewish tradition ] , a persecutor of the church ; and as to righteousness [ supposed right living ] which [ my fellow Jews believe ] is in the Law , I proved myself blameless .
AMP	Philippians	3	7	But whatever former things were gains to me [ as I thought then ] , these things [ once regarded as advancements in merit ] I have come to consider as loss [ absolutely worthless ] for the sake of Christ [ and the purpose which He has given my life ] .
AMP	Philippians	3	8	But more than that , I count everything as loss compared to the priceless privilege and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord [ and of growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with Him—a joy unequaled ] . For His sake I have lost everything , and I consider it all garbage , so that I may gain Christ ,
AMP	Philippians	3	9	and may be found in Him [ believing and relying on Him ] , not having any righteousness of my own derived from [ my obedience to ] the Law and its rituals , but [ possessing ] that [ genuine righteousness ] which comes through faith in Christ , the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith .
AMP	Philippians	3	10	And this , so that I may know Him [ experientially , becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Him , understanding the remarkable wonders of His Person more completely ] and [ in that same way experience ] the power of His resurrection [ which overflows and is active in believers ] , and [ that I may share ] the fellowship of His sufferings , by being continually conformed [ inwardly into His likeness even ] to His death [ dying as He did ] ;
AMP	Philippians	3	11	[ d ] so that I may attain to the resurrection [ that will raise me ] from the dead .
AMP	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already obtained it [ this goal of being Christlike ] or have already been made perfect , but I actively press on [ e ] so that I may take hold of that [ perfection ] for which Christ Jesus took hold of me and made me His own . ( A )
AMP	Philippians	3	13	[ f ] Brothers and sisters , I do not consider that I have made it my own yet ; but one thing I do : forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead ,
AMP	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal to win the [ heavenly ] prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus .
AMP	Philippians	3	15	All of us who are mature [ pursuing spiritual perfection ] should have this attitude . And if in any respect you have a different attitude , that too God will make clear to you .
AMP	Philippians	3	16	Only let us stay true to what we have already attained .
AMP	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , together follow my example and observe those who live by the pattern we gave you .
AMP	Philippians	3	18	For there are many , of whom I have often told you , and now tell you even with tears , who live as enemies of the cross of Christ [ rejecting and opposing His way of salvation ] ,
AMP	Philippians	3	19	whose fate is destruction , whose god is their belly [ their worldly appetite , their sensuality , their vanity ] , and whose glory is in their shame—who focus their mind on earthly and temporal things .
AMP	Philippians	3	20	But [ we are different , because ] our citizenship is in heaven . And from there we eagerly await [ the coming of ] the Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ;
AMP	Philippians	3	21	who , by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself , will [ not only ] transform [ but completely refashion ] our earthly bodies so that they will be like His glorious resurrected body .

AMP	Philippians	4	3	Indeed , I ask you too , my true companion , to help these women [ to keep on cooperating ] , for they have shared my struggle in the [ cause of the ] gospel , together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the Book of Life . ( A )
AMP	Philippians	4	5	Let your gentle spirit [ your graciousness , unselfishness , mercy , tolerance , and patience ] be known to all people . The Lord is near .
AMP	Philippians	4	6	Do not be anxious or worried about anything , but in everything [ every circumstance and situation ] by prayer and petition with thanksgiving , continue to make your [ specific ] requests known to God .
AMP	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God [ that peace which reassures the heart , that peace ] which transcends all understanding , [ that peace which ] stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus [ is yours ] . ( C )
AMP	Philippians	4	8	Finally , [ b ] believers , whatever is true , whatever is honorable and worthy of respect , whatever is right and confirmed by God ’ s word , whatever is pure and wholesome , whatever is lovely and brings peace , whatever is admirable and of good repute ; if there is any excellence , if there is anything worthy of praise , think continually on these things [ center your mind on them , and implant them in your heart ] .

AMP	Philippians	4	10	I rejoiced greatly in the Lord , that now at last you have renewed your concern for me ; indeed , you were concerned about me before , but you had no opportunity to show it .
AMP	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak from [ any personal ] need , for I have learned to be content [ and self-sufficient through Christ , satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or uneasy ] regardless of my circumstances .
AMP	Philippians	4	12	I know how to get along and live humbly [ in difficult times ] , and I also know how to enjoy abundance and live in prosperity . In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret [ of facing life ] , whether well-fed or going hungry , whether having an abundance or being in need .
AMP	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things [ which He has called me to do ] through Him who strengthens and empowers me [ to fulfill His purpose—I am self-sufficient in Christ ’ s sufficiency ; I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him who infuses me with inner strength and confident peace . ]
AMP	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless , it was right of you to share [ with me ] in my difficulties .
AMP	Philippians	4	15	And you Philippians know that in the early days of preaching the gospel , after I left Macedonia , no church shared with me in the matter of [ c ] giving and receiving except you alone ;
AMP	Philippians	4	16	for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs .
AMP	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek the gift itself , but I do seek the profit which increases to your [ heavenly ] account [ the blessing which is accumulating for you ] .
AMP	Philippians	4	18	But I have received everything in full and more ; I am amply supplied , having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me . They are the fragrant aroma of an offering , an acceptable sacrifice which God welcomes and in which He delights .

AMP	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , as we pray always for you ,
AMP	Colossians	1	4	for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus [ how you lean on Him with absolute confidence in His power , wisdom , and goodness ] , and of the [ unselfish ] [ c ] love which you have for all the saints ( God ’ s people ) ;
AMP	Colossians	1	5	because of the [ confident ] hope [ of experiencing that ] which is reserved and waiting for you in heaven . You previously heard of this hope in the message of truth , the gospel [ regarding salvation ]
AMP	Colossians	1	6	which has come to you . Indeed , just as in the whole world the gospel is constantly bearing fruit and spreading [ by God ’ s power ] , just as it has been doing among you ever since the day you first heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth [ becoming thoroughly and deeply acquainted with it ] .
AMP	Colossians	1	7	You learned it from [ our representative ] Epaphras , our beloved fellow bond-servant , who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf
AMP	Colossians	1	8	and he also has told us of your love [ well-grounded and nurtured ] in the [ Holy ] Spirit .
AMP	Colossians	1	9	For this reason , since the day we heard about it , we have not stopped praying for you , asking [ specifically ] that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom [ with insight into His purposes ] , and in understanding [ of spiritual things ] ,
AMP	Colossians	1	10	so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord [ displaying admirable character , moral courage , and personal integrity ] , to [ fully ] please Him in all things , bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing in the knowledge of God [ with deeper faith , clearer insight and fervent love for His precepts ] ;
AMP	Colossians	1	11	[ we pray that you may be ] strengthened and invigorated with all power , according to His glorious might , to attain every kind of endurance and patience with joy ;

AMP	Colossians	1	14	in whom we have redemption [ because of His sacrifice , resulting in ] the forgiveness of our sins [ and the cancellation of sins ’ penalty ] .
AMP	Colossians	1	15	He is the exact living image [ the essential manifestation ] of the unseen God [ the visible representation of the invisible ] , the firstborn [ the preeminent one , the sovereign , and the originator ] of all creation .
AMP	Colossians	1	16	For [ d ] by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth , [ things ] visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities ; all things were created and exist through Him [ that is , by His activity ] and for Him .
AMP	Colossians	1	17	And He Himself existed and is before all things , and in Him all things hold together . [ His is the controlling , cohesive force of the universe . ] ( A )
AMP	Colossians	1	18	He is also the head [ the life-source and leader ] of the body , the [ e ] church ; and He is the beginning , [ f ] the firstborn from the dead , so that He Himself will occupy the first place [ He will stand supreme and be preeminent ] in everything . ( B )
AMP	Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father for all the fullness [ of deity—the sum total of His essence , all His perfection , powers , and attributes ] to dwell [ permanently ] in Him ( the Son ) ,
AMP	Colossians	1	20	and through [ the intervention of ] the Son to reconcile all things to Himself , making peace [ with believers ] through the blood of His cross ; through Him , [ I say , ] whether things on earth or things in heaven .
AMP	Colossians	1	21	And although you were at one time estranged and alienated and hostile-minded [ toward Him ] , participating in evil things ,
AMP	Colossians	1	22	yet Christ has now reconciled you [ to God ] in His [ g ] physical body through death , in order to present you before the Father holy and blameless and beyond reproach—
AMP	Colossians	1	23	[ and He will do this ] if you continue in the faith , well-grounded and steadfast , and not shifting away from the [ confident ] hope [ that is a result ] of the gospel that you have heard , which was proclaimed [ h ] in all creation under heaven , and of which [ gospel ] I , Paul , was made a minister .
AMP	Colossians	1	24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf . And with my own body I [ i ] supplement whatever is lacking [ on our part ] of Christ ’ s afflictions , on behalf of His body , which is the church .
AMP	Colossians	1	25	In this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship which God entrusted to me for your sake , so that I might make the word of God fully known [ among you ] —
AMP	Colossians	1	26	that is , [ j ] the mystery which was hidden [ from angels and mankind ] for ages and generations , but has now been revealed to His saints ( God ’ s people ) .
AMP	Colossians	1	27	God [ in His eternal plan ] chose to make known to them how great for the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery , which is Christ in and among you , the hope and guarantee of [ realizing the ] glory .
AMP	Colossians	1	28	We proclaim Him , warning and instructing everyone in all wisdom [ that is , with comprehensive insight into the word and purposes of God ] , so that we may present every person complete in Christ [ mature , fully trained , and perfect in Him—the Anointed ] .

AMP	Colossians	2	9	For in Him all the fullness of Deity ( the Godhead ) dwells in bodily form [ completely expressing the divine essence of God ] .
AMP	Colossians	2	10	And in Him you have been made complete [ achieving spiritual stature through Christ ] , and He is the head over all rule and authority [ of every angelic and earthly power ] .
AMP	Colossians	2	11	In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , but by the [ spiritual ] circumcision of Christ in the stripping off of the body of the flesh [ the sinful carnal nature ] ,
AMP	Colossians	2	12	having been buried with Him in baptism and raised with Him [ to a new life ] through [ your ] faith in the working of God , [ as displayed ] when He raised Christ from the dead .
AMP	Colossians	2	13	When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh ( worldliness , manner of life ) , God made you alive together with Christ , having [ freely ] forgiven us all our sins ,

AMP	Colossians	2	15	When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities [ those supernatural forces of evil operating against us ] , He made a public example of them [ exhibiting them as captives in His triumphal procession ] , having triumphed over them through [ i ] the cross .

AMP	Colossians	2	18	Let no one defraud you of your prize [ your freedom in Christ and your salvation ] by insisting on mock humility and the worship of angels , going into detail about visions [ he claims ] he has seen [ to justify his authority ] , puffed up [ in conceit ] by his unspiritual mind ,

AMP	Colossians	3	3	For you died [ to this world ] , and your [ new , real ] life is hidden with Christ in God .
AMP	Colossians	3	2	Set your mind and keep focused habitually on the things above [ the heavenly things ] , not on things that are on the earth [ which have only temporal value ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , who is our life , [ a ] appears , then you also will appear with Him in glory .
AMP	Colossians	3	5	So put to death and deprive of power the evil longings of your earthly body [ with its sensual , self-centered instincts ] immorality , impurity , sinful passion , evil desire , and greed , which is [ a kind of ] idolatry [ because it replaces your devotion to God ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	6	Because of these [ sinful ] things the [ divine ] wrath of God is coming [ b ] on the sons of disobedience [ those who fail to listen and who routinely and obstinately disregard God ’ s precepts ] ,
AMP	Colossians	3	7	and in these [ sinful things ] you also once walked , when you were habitually living in them [ without the knowledge of Christ ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	8	But now rid yourselves [ completely ] of all these things : anger , rage , malice , slander , and obscene ( abusive , filthy , vulgar ) language from your mouth .
AMP	Colossians	3	9	Do not lie to one another , for you have stripped off the old self with its evil practices ,
AMP	Colossians	3	10	and have put on the new [ spiritual ] self who is being continually renewed in true knowledge in the image of Him who created the new self— ( B )
AMP	Colossians	3	11	a renewal in which there is no [ distinction between ] Greek and Jew , circumcised and uncircumcised , [ nor between nations whether ] [ c ] barbarian or [ d ] Scythian , [ nor in status whether ] slave or free , but Christ is all , and in all [ so believers are equal in Christ , without distinction ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	12	So , as God ’ s own chosen people , who are holy [ set apart , sanctified for His purpose ] and well-beloved [ by God Himself ] , put on a heart of compassion , kindness , humility , gentleness , and patience [ which has the power to endure whatever injustice or unpleasantness comes , with good temper ] ;
AMP	Colossians	3	13	bearing graciously with one another , and willingly forgiving each other if one has a cause for complaint against another ; just as the Lord has forgiven you , so should you forgive .
AMP	Colossians	3	14	Beyond all these things put on and wrap yourselves in [ unselfish ] love , which is the perfect bond of unity [ for everything is bound together in agreement when each one seeks the best for others ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	15	Let the peace of Christ [ the inner calm of one who walks daily with Him ] be the controlling factor in your hearts [ deciding and settling questions that arise ] . To this peace indeed you were called as members in one body [ of believers ] . And be thankful [ to God always ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	16	Let the [ spoken ] word of Christ have its home within you [ dwelling in your heart and mind—permeating every aspect of your being ] as you teach [ spiritual things ] and admonish and train one another with all wisdom , singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God .
AMP	Colossians	3	17	Whatever you do [ no matter what it is ] in word or deed , do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus [ and in dependence on Him ] , giving thanks to God the Father through Him . Family Relations
AMP	Colossians	3	18	Wives , be [ e ] subject to your husbands [ out of respect for their position as protector , and their accountability to God ] , as is proper and [ f ] fitting in the Lord .
AMP	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives [ with an affectionate , sympathetic , selfless love that always seeks the best for them ] and do not be embittered or resentful toward them [ because of the responsibilities of marriage ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents [ as God ’ s representatives ] in all things , for this [ attitude of respect and obedience ] is well-pleasing [ g ] to the Lord [ and will bring you God ’ s promised blessings ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , do not provoke or irritate or exasperate your children [ with demands that are trivial or unreasonable or humiliating or abusive ; nor by favoritism or indifference ; treat them tenderly with lovingkindness ] , so they will not lose heart and become discouraged or unmotivated [ with their spirits broken ] .
AMP	Colossians	3	22	Servants , in everything obey those who are your masters on earth , not only with external service , as those who merely please people , but with sincerity of heart because of your fear of the Lord .
AMP	Colossians	3	23	Whatever you do [ whatever your task may be ] , work from the soul [ that is , put in your very best effort ] , as [ something done ] for the Lord and not for men ,
AMP	Colossians	3	24	knowing [ with all certainty ] that it is from the Lord [ not from men ] that you will receive the inheritance which is your [ greatest ] reward . It is the Lord Christ whom you [ actually ] serve .

AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , Silvanus ( Silas ) , and Timothy , To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We ought always and indeed are morally obligated [ as those in debt ] to give thanks to God for you , [ a ] brothers and sisters , as is fitting , because your faith is growing ever greater , and the [ unselfish ] [ b ] love of each one of you toward one another is continually increasing .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	Therefore , we speak of you with pride among the churches of God for your steadfastness [ your unflinching endurance , and patience ] and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecution and [ crushing ] distress which you endure .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	This is a positive proof of the righteous judgment of God [ a sign of His fair verdict ] , so that you will be considered worthy of His kingdom , for which indeed you are suffering .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	For after all it is only just for God to repay with distress those who distress you ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	and to give relief to you who are so distressed and to us as well when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	dealing out [ full and complete ] vengeance to those who do not [ seek to ] know God and to those who ignore and refuse to obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus [ by choosing not to respond to Him ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	These people will pay the penalty and endure the punishment of [ c ] everlasting destruction , banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day [ that is , glorified through the changed lives of those who have accepted Him as Savior and have been set apart for His purpose ] , and to be marveled at among all who have believed , because our testimony to you was believed and trusted [ and confirmed in your lives ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	With this in view , we constantly pray for you , that our God will count you worthy of your calling [ to faith ] and with [ His ] power fulfill every desire for goodness , and complete [ your ] every work of faith ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you [ by what you do ] , and you in Him , according to the [ precious ] grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ . Footnotes -

AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Let no one in any way deceive or entrap you , for that day will not come unless the [ c ] apostasy comes first [ that is , the great rebellion , the abandonment of the faith by professed Christians ] , and the man of lawlessness is revealed , the son of destruction [ the Antichrist , the one who is destined to be destroyed ] , ( B )
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	who opposes and exalts himself [ so proudly and so insolently ] above [ d ] every so-called god or object of worship , so that he [ actually enters and ] takes his seat in the temple of God , publicly proclaiming that he himself is God . ( C )
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Do you not remember that when I was still with you , I was telling you these things ?
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And you know what restrains him now [ from being revealed ] ; it is so that he will be revealed at his own [ appointed ] time .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of lawlessness [ rebellion against divine authority and the coming reign of lawlessness ] is already at work ; [ but it is restrained ] only until he who now restrains it is taken out of the way .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	Then the lawless one [ the Antichrist ] will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by the appearance of His coming . ( D )
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	The coming of the [ Antichrist , the lawless ] one is through the activity of Satan , [ attended ] with great power [ all kinds of counterfeit miracles ] and [ deceptive ] signs and false wonders [ all of them lies ] ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	and by unlimited seduction to evil and with all the deception of wickedness for those who are perishing , because they did not welcome the love of the truth [ of the gospel ] so as to be saved [ they were spiritually blind , and rejected the truth that would have saved them ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	Because of this God will send upon them a misleading influence , [ an activity of error and deception ] so they will believe the lie ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	in order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe the truth [ about their sin , and the need for salvation through Christ ] , but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we should and are [ morally ] obligated [ as debtors ] always to give thanks to God for you , believers beloved by the Lord , because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through the [ e ] sanctifying work of the Spirit [ that sets you apart for God ’ s purpose ] and by your faith in the truth [ of God ’ s word that leads you to spiritual maturity ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	It was to this end that He called you through our gospel [ the good news of Jesus ’ death , burial , and resurrection ] , so that you may obtain and share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	So then , [ f ] brothers and sisters , stand firm and hold [ tightly ] to the traditions which you were taught , whether by word of mouth or by letter from us .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father , who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort and encouragement and the good [ well-founded ] hope [ of salvation ] by His grace ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	comfort and encourage and strengthen your hearts [ keeping them steadfast and on course ] in every good work and word . Footnotes -

AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	We have confidence in the Lord concerning you , that you are doing and will continue to do the things [ which ] we command .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you , believers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and by His authority , that you withdraw and keep away from every brother or sister who leads an undisciplined life and does not live in accordance with the tradition and teaching that [ a ] you have received from us .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example , because we did not act in an undisciplined or inappropriate manner when we were with you [ we were never idle or lazy , nor did we avoid our duties ] ,
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	nor did we eat anyone ’ s bread without paying for it , but with labor and hardship we worked night and day [ to pay our own way ] so that we would not be a financial burden on any of you [ for our support ] ;
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	not because we do not have a right to such support , but [ we provided our own financial support ] to offer ourselves as a model for you , so that you would follow our example .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even while we were with you , we used to give you this order : if anyone is not willing to work , then he is [ b ] not to eat , either .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	Indeed , we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined and inappropriate life , doing no work at all , but acting like busybodies [ meddling in other people ’ s business ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now such people we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work quietly and earn their own food and other necessities [ supporting themselves instead of depending on the hospitality of others ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	And as for [ the rest of ] you , [ c ] believers , do not grow tired or lose heart in doing good [ but continue doing what is right without weakening ] .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	Now if anyone [ in the church ] does not obey what we say in this letter , take special note of that person and do not associate with him , so that he will be ashamed and repent .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	Do not regard him as an enemy , but keep admonishing him as a [ believing ] brother .
AMP	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace at all times and in every way [ that peace and spiritual well-being that comes to those who walk with Him , regardless of life ’ s circumstances ] . The Lord be with you all . ( A )

AMP	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia , stay on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain individuals not to teach any different doctrines ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	4	nor to pay attention to legends ( fables , myths ) and endless genealogies , which give rise to useless speculation and meaningless arguments rather than advancing God ’ s program of instruction which is grounded in faith [ and requires surrendering the entire self to God in absolute trust and confidence ] .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	5	But the goal of our instruction is love [ which springs ] from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	6	Some individuals have wandered away from these things into empty arguments and useless discussions ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	7	wanting to be teachers of the Law [ of Moses ] , even though they do not understand the terms they use or the subjects about which they make [ such ] confident declarations .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	8	Now we know [ without any doubt ] that the Law is good , if one uses it lawfully and appropriately ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	9	understanding the fact that law is not enacted for the righteous person [ the one in right standing with God ] , but for lawless and rebellious people , for the ungodly and sinful , for the irreverent and profane , for those who kill their fathers or mothers , for murderers ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	10	for sexually immoral persons , for homosexuals , for [ a ] kidnappers and slave traders , for liars , for perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	11	according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , with which I have been entrusted .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who has granted me [ the needed ] strength and made me able for this , because He considered me faithful and trustworthy , putting me into service [ for this ministry ] ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	13	even though I was formerly a blasphemer [ of our Lord ] and a persecutor [ of His church ] and a shameful and outrageous and violent aggressor [ toward believers ] . Yet I was shown mercy because I acted out of ignorance in unbelief .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	14	The grace of our Lord [ His amazing , unmerited favor and blessing ] flowed out in superabundance [ for me , together ] with the faith and love which are [ realized ] in Christ Jesus .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	15	[ b ] This is a faithful and trustworthy statement , deserving full acceptance and approval , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners , among whom I am foremost .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	16	Yet for this reason I found mercy , so that in me as the foremost [ of sinners ] , Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example or pattern for those who [ c ] would believe in Him for eternal life .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the King of the ages [ eternal ] , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen .
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	18	This command I entrust to you , Timothy , my son , in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you , so that [ inspired and aided ] by them you may fight the good fight [ in contending with false teachers ] ,
AMP	1%20Timothy	1	19	keeping your faith [ leaning completely on God with absolute trust and confidence in His guidance ] and having a good conscience ; for some [ people ] have rejected [ their moral compass ] and have made a shipwreck of their faith .

AMP	1%20Timothy	2	4	who [ b ] wishes all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge and recognition of the [ divine ] truth .

AMP	Hebrews	1	1	God , having spoken to the fathers long ago in [ the voices and writings of ] the prophets in many separate revelations [ each of which set forth a portion of the truth ] , and in many ways ,
AMP	Hebrews	1	2	has in these last days spoken [ with finality ] to us in [ the person of One who is by His character and nature ] His Son [ namely Jesus ] , whom He appointed heir and lawful owner of all things , through whom also He created the universe [ that is , the universe as a space-time-matter continuum ] .
AMP	Hebrews	1	3	The Son is the radiance and only expression of the glory of [ our awesome ] God [ reflecting God ’ s [ a ] Shekinah glory , the Light-being , the brilliant light of the divine ] , and the exact representation and perfect imprint of His [ Father ’ s ] essence , and upholding and maintaining and propelling all things [ the entire physical and spiritual universe ] by His powerful word [ carrying the universe along to its predetermined goal ] . When He [ Himself and no other ] had [ by offering Himself on the cross as a sacrifice for sin ] accomplished purification from sins and established our freedom from guilt , He sat down [ revealing His completed work ] at the right hand of the Majesty on high [ revealing His Divine authority ] ,
AMP	Hebrews	1	4	having become as much superior to angels , since He has inherited a more excellent and glorious [ b ] name than they [ that is , Son—the name above all names ] .
AMP	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did the Father ever say , “ You are My Son , Today I have begotten ( fathered ) You [ established You as a Son , with kingly dignity ] ” ? And again [ did He ever say to the angels ] , “ I shall be a Father to Him And He shall be a Son to Me ” ? ( A )
AMP	Hebrews	1	6	[ c ] And when He again brings the firstborn [ highest-ranking Son ] into the world , He says , “ And all the angels of God are to worship Him. ” ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	1	7	And concerning the angels He says , “ Who makes His angels winds , And His ministering servants flames of fire [ to do His bidding ] . ” ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	1	8	But about the Son [ the Father says to Him ] , “ Your throne , [ d ] O God , is forever and ever , And the [ e ] scepter of [ absolute ] righteousness is the scepter of [ f ] His kingdom .
AMP	Hebrews	1	9	“ You have loved righteousness [ integrity , virtue , uprightness in purpose ] and have hated lawlessness [ injustice , sin ] . Therefore God , Your God , Has anointed You With the oil of gladness above Your companions. ” ( D )
AMP	Hebrews	1	10	And , “ [ g ] You , Lord , laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning , And the heavens are the works of Your hands ;
AMP	Hebrews	1	11	They will perish , but You remain [ forever and ever ] ; And they will all wear out like a garment ,
AMP	Hebrews	1	12	And like a robe You will roll them up ; Like a garment they will be changed . But [ h ] You are the same [ forever ] , And Your years will never end. ” ( E )

AMP	Hebrews	1	14	Are not all the angels ministering spirits sent out [ by God ] to serve ( accompany , protect ) those who will inherit salvation ? [ Of course they are ! ] Footnotes - Hebrews 1:3 The word “ Shekinah ” does not appear in Scripture , but has been used by both Christians and Jews to describe the visible divine Presence of God , in such things as the burning bush , the cloud and the pillar of fire that led the Hebrews in the wilderness , and the Presence of God that rested between the cherubim over the mercy seat of the ark . - Hebrews 1:4 In Greek “ name ” occurs last in this verse to emphasize that Jesus alone bears the name Son . No angel is superior to the Son . - Hebrews 1:6 Most likely a reference to the second coming of Christ when He will be acknowledged as divine and worshiped as the Son of God . Another view suggests that this may be a reference to His incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth . - Hebrews 1:8 The Son is recognized as deity by being addressed by the Father as “ God. ” - Hebrews 1:8 I.e . symbol of authority . - Hebrews 1:8 Late mss read Your . - Hebrews 1:10 The deity of Jesus is acclaimed by the designation “ You , Lord. ” - Hebrews 1:12 Since He is deity , the eternality of Jesus is recognized .

Earth Subject to Man
AMP	Hebrews	2	5	It was not to angels that God subjected the [ inhabited ] world of the future [ when Christ reigns ] , about which we are speaking .
AMP	Hebrews	2	6	But one has [ solemnly ] testified somewhere [ in Scripture ] , saying , “ What is man , that You are mindful of him , Or the son of man , that You graciously care for him ?
AMP	Hebrews	2	7	“ You have made him for a little while lower [ in status ] than the angels ; You have crowned him with glory and honor , [ c ] And set him over the works of Your hands ;
AMP	Hebrews	2	8	You have put all things in subjection under his feet [ confirming his supremacy ] . ” Now in putting all things in subjection to man , He left nothing outside his control . But at present we do not yet see all things subjected to him . ( A ) Jesus Briefly Humbled
AMP	Hebrews	2	9	But we do see Jesus , who was made lower than the angels for a little while [ by taking on the limitations of humanity ] , crowned with glory and honor because of His suffering of death , so that by the grace of God [ extended to sinners ] He might experience death for [ the sins of ] everyone .
AMP	Hebrews	2	10	For it was fitting for God [ that is , an act worthy of His divine nature ] that He , for whose sake are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many sons to glory , should make the [ d ] author and founder of their salvation perfect through suffering [ bringing to maturity the human experience necessary for Him to be perfectly equipped for His office as High Priest ] .
AMP	Hebrews	2	11	Both Jesus who sanctifies and those who are sanctified [ that is , spiritually transformed , made holy , and set apart for God ’ s purpose ] are all from one Father ; for this reason He is not ashamed to call them [ e ] brothers and sisters ,
AMP	Hebrews	2	12	saying , “ I will declare Your ( the Father ’ s ) name to My brethren ( believers ) , In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your praise. ” ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	2	13	And again [ [ f ] He says ] , “ My trust and confident hope will be placed in Him. ” And again , “ Here I am , I and the children whom God has given Me. ” ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore , since [ these His ] children share in flesh and blood [ the physical nature of mankind ] , He Himself in a similar manner also shared in the same [ physical nature , but without sin ] , so that through [ experiencing ] death He might make powerless ( ineffective , impotent ) him who had the power of death—that is , the devil—
AMP	Hebrews	2	15	and [ that He ] might free all those who through [ the haunting ] fear of death were held in slavery throughout their lives .
AMP	Hebrews	2	16	For , as we all know , He ( Christ ) does not take hold of [ the fallen ] angels [ to give them a helping hand ] , but He does take hold of [ the fallen ] descendants of Abraham [ extending to them His hand of deliverance ] . ( D )
AMP	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore , it was essential that He had to be made like His brothers ( mankind ) in every respect , so that He might [ by experience ] become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things related to God , to make atonement ( propitiation ) for the people ’ s sins [ thereby wiping away the sin , satisfying divine justice , and providing a way of reconciliation between God and mankind ] .

AMP	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all things is God .
AMP	Hebrews	3	5	Now Moses was faithful in [ the administration of ] all God ’ s house , [ but only ] as a ministering servant , [ his ministry serving ] as a testimony of the things which were to be spoken afterward [ the revelation to come in Christ ] ; ( B )

AMP	Hebrews	3	8	Do not harden your hearts as [ your fathers did ] in the rebellion [ of Israel at [ c ] Meribah ] , On the day of testing in the wilderness ,
AMP	Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tried Me by testing [ My forbearance and tolerance ] , And saw My works for forty years [ And found I stood their test ] .

AMP	Hebrews	3	12	Take care , brothers and sisters , that there not be in any one of you a wicked , unbelieving [ d ] heart [ which refuses to trust and rely on the Lord , a heart ] that turns away from the living God .
AMP	Hebrews	3	13	But continually encourage one another every day , as long as it is called “ Today ” [ and there is an opportunity ] , so that none of you will be hardened [ into settled rebellion ] by the deceitfulness of sin [ its cleverness , delusive glamour , and sophistication ] .
AMP	Hebrews	3	14	For we [ believers ] have become partakers of Christ [ sharing in all that the Messiah has for us ] , if only we hold firm our newborn confidence [ which originally led us to Him ] until the end ,
AMP	Hebrews	3	15	while it is said , “ Today [ while there is still opportunity ] if you hear His voice , Do not harden your heart , as when they provoked Me [ in the rebellion in the desert at Meribah ] . ” ( D )
AMP	Hebrews	3	16	For who were they who heard and yet provoked Him [ with rebellious acts ] ? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses ?
AMP	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was He angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose dead bodies were scattered in the desert ?
AMP	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did He swear [ an oath ] that they would not enter His rest , but to those who disobeyed [ those who would not listen to His word ] ?

AMP	Hebrews	4	4	For somewhere [ in Scripture ] He has said this about the seventh day : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all His works ” ; ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	4	2	For indeed we have had the good news [ of salvation ] preached to us , just as the Israelites also [ when the good news of the promised land came to them ] ; but the message they heard did not benefit them , because it was not united with faith [ in God ] by those who heard .
AMP	Hebrews	4	3	For we who believe [ that is , we who personally trust and confidently rely on God ] enter that rest [ so we have His inner peace now because we are confident in our salvation , and assured of His power ] , just as He has said , “ As I swore [ an oath ] in My wrath , They shall not enter My rest , ” [ this He said ] although His works were [ a ] completed from the foundation of the world [ waiting for all who would believe ] . ( A )
AMP	Hebrews	4	5	and again in this , “ They shall not enter My rest. ” ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore , since the promise remains for some to enter His rest , and those who formerly had the good news preached to them failed to [ grasp it and did not ] enter because of [ their unbelief evidenced by ] disobedience ,
AMP	Hebrews	4	7	He again sets a definite day , [ a new ] “ Today , ” [ providing another opportunity to enter that rest by ] saying through David after so long a time , just as has been said before [ in the words already quoted ] , “ Today if you hear His voice , Do not harden your hearts. ” ( D )
AMP	Hebrews	4	8	[ This mention of a rest was not a reference to their entering into Canaan . ] For if Joshua had given them rest , God would not speak about another day [ of opportunity ] after that .
AMP	Hebrews	4	9	So there remains a [ full and complete ] Sabbath rest for the people of God .
AMP	Hebrews	4	10	For the one who has once entered His rest has also rested from [ the weariness and pain of ] his [ human ] labors , just as God rested from [ those labors uniquely ] His own . ( E )
AMP	Hebrews	4	11	Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest [ of God , to know and experience it for ourselves ] , so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience [ as those who died in the wilderness ] .
AMP	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living and active and full of power [ making it operative , energizing , and effective ] . It is sharper than any two-edged [ b ] sword , penetrating as far as the division of the [ c ] soul and spirit [ the completeness of a person ] , and of both joints and marrow [ the deepest parts of our nature ] , exposing and judging the very thoughts and intentions of the heart .
AMP	Hebrews	4	13	And not a creature exists that is concealed from His sight , but all things are open and exposed , and revealed to the eyes of Him with whom we have to give account .
AMP	Hebrews	4	14	Inasmuch then as we [ believers ] have a great High Priest who has [ already ascended and ] passed through the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our confession [ of faith and cling tenaciously to our absolute trust in Him as Savior ] .
AMP	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathize and understand our weaknesses and temptations , but One who has been tempted [ knowing exactly how it feels to be human ] in every respect as we are , yet without [ committing any ] sin .
AMP	Hebrews	4	16	Therefore let us [ with privilege ] approach the throne of grace [ that is , the throne of God ’ s gracious favor ] with confidence and without fear , so that we may receive mercy [ for our failures ] and find [ His amazing ] grace to help in time of need [ an appropriate blessing , coming just at the right moment ] .

AMP	Hebrews	5	2	He is able to deal gently with the spiritually ignorant and misguided , since he is also subject to human weakness ;
AMP	Hebrews	5	3	and because of this [ human weakness ] he is required to offer sacrifices for sins , for himself as well as for the people .
AMP	Hebrews	5	4	And besides , one does not appropriate for himself the honor [ of being high priest ] , but he who is called by God , just as Aaron was .
AMP	Hebrews	5	6	just as He also says in another place ,
AMP	Hebrews	5	7	In the days of His earthly life , Jesus offered up both [ specific ] petitions and [ urgent ] supplications [ for that which He needed ] with fervent crying and tears to the One who was [ always ] able to save Him from death , and He was heard because of His reverent submission toward God [ His sinlessness and His unfailing determination to do the Father ’ s will ] .
AMP	Hebrews	5	8	Although He was a Son [ who had never been disobedient to the Father ] , He learned [ active , special ] obedience through what He suffered .

AMP	Hebrews	6	9	But , beloved , even though we speak to you in this way , [ c ] we are convinced of better things concerning you , and of things that accompany salvation .
AMP	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown for His name in ministering to [ the needs of ] the saints ( God ’ s people ) , as you do .
AMP	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire for each one of you to show the same diligence [ all the way through ] so as to realize and enjoy the full assurance of hope until the end ,
AMP	Hebrews	6	12	so that you will not be [ spiritually ] sluggish , but [ will instead be ] imitators of those who through faith [ lean on God with absolute trust and confidence in Him and in His power ] and by patient endurance [ even when suffering ] are [ now ] inheriting the promises .
AMP	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made the promise to Abraham , He swore [ an oath ] by Himself , since He had no one greater by whom to swear ,
AMP	Hebrews	6	14	saying , “ I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply you. ” ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	6	15	And so , having patiently waited , he realized the promise [ in the miraculous birth of Isaac , as a pledge of what was to come from God ] .
AMP	Hebrews	6	16	Indeed men swear [ an oath ] by [ d ] one greater than themselves , and with them [ in all disputes ] the oath serves as confirmation [ of what has been said ] and is an end of the dispute .
AMP	Hebrews	6	17	In the same way God , in His desire to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His purpose , intervened and guaranteed it with an oath ,
AMP	Hebrews	6	18	so that by two unchangeable things [ His promise and His oath ] in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled [ to Him ] for refuge would have strong encouragement and indwelling strength to hold tightly to the hope set before us .
AMP	Hebrews	6	19	This hope [ this confident assurance ] we have as an anchor of the soul [ it can not slip and it can not break down under whatever pressure bears upon it ] —a safe and steadfast hope that enters within the veil [ of the heavenly temple , that most Holy Place in which the very presence of God dwells ] , ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus has entered [ in advance ] as a forerunner for us , having become a High Priest forever according to the order of [ e ] Melchizedek . ( D ) Footnotes - Hebrews 6:4 This is the same Greek word that is used in Matt 27:34 regarding Jesus ’ tasting the wine mixed with gall during His crucifixion . After tasting what was being offered to Him He refused to drink it . Perhaps the use of this word in this passage ( vv 4-6 ) refers to those who superficially “ tasted ” the gospel and outwardly appeared to embrace the Christian experience , but inwardly never committed in full surrender to Christ . In this case , the act of “ falling away ” was simply the public expression of their true position and their rejection of Jesus as Messiah regardless of the evidence . - Hebrews 6:6 This passage is one of the most difficult to interpret in Hebrews . Four major views have been suggested :
AMP	Hebrews	6	1	Cor 3:11-17 . - Hebrews 6:9 The concerns of the writer of Hebrews as outlined in vv 1-8 have not happened to the Hebrew believers and the writer does not expect them to happen . - Hebrews 6:16 Or Him who is greater . - Hebrews 6:20 See note 7:3 . Copyright ©

AMP	Hebrews	7	4	Now pause and consider how great this man was to whom Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth of the spoils .
AMP	Hebrews	7	5	It is true that those descendants of Levi who are charged with the priestly office are commanded in the Law to collect tithes from the people—which means , from their kinsmen—though these have descended from Abraham .
AMP	Hebrews	7	6	But this person [ Melchizedek ] who is not from their Levitical ancestry received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who possessed the promises [ of God ] .
AMP	Hebrews	7	8	) . If this is so , then Christ , as the Son of God , would be the “ High Priest ” of the order in which Melchizedek served as priest in the sense that angels are spiritual beings who have a pretemporal , but not eternal origin . Another view suggests that Melchizedek was perhaps a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus in human form . Those who maintain that Melchizedek was an ordinary human being would say the writer is speaking symbolically concerning his ancestry ; hence the insertion of “ any record of ” in the text of v
AMP	Hebrews	7	9	A person might even say that Levi [ the father of the priestly tribe ] himself , who received tithes , paid tithes through Abraham [ the father of all Israel and of all who believe ] ,
AMP	Hebrews	7	10	for Levi was still in the loins ( unborn ) of his forefather [ Abraham ] when Melchizedek met him ( Abraham ) .
AMP	Hebrews	7	11	Now if perfection [ a perfect fellowship between God and the worshiper ] had been attained through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people were given the Law ) what further need was there for another and different kind of priest to arise , one in the manner of Melchizedek , rather than one appointed to the order of Aaron ?
AMP	Hebrews	7	12	For when there is a change in the priesthood , there is of necessity a change of the law [ concerning the priesthood ] as well .
AMP	Hebrews	7	13	For the One of whom these things are said belonged [ not to the priestly line of Levi but ] to another tribe , from which no one has officiated or served at the altar .
AMP	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord descended from [ the tribe of ] Judah , and Moses mentioned nothing about priests in connection with that tribe .
AMP	Hebrews	7	15	And this becomes even more evident if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek , ( A )
AMP	Hebrews	7	16	who has become a priest , not on the basis of a [ c ] physical and legal requirement in the Law [ concerning his ancestry as a descendant of Levi ] , but on the basis of the power of an indestructible and endless life .
AMP	Hebrews	7	17	For it is attested [ by God ] of Him , “ You ( Christ ) are a Priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek. ” ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	7	18	For , on the one hand , a former commandment is cancelled because of its weakness and uselessness [ because of its inability to justify the sinner before God ]
AMP	Hebrews	7	19	( for the Law never made anything perfect ) ; while on the other hand a better hope is introduced through which we now continually draw near to God .
AMP	Hebrews	7	20	And indeed it was not without the taking of an oath [ that Christ was made priest ]
AMP	Hebrews	7	21	( for those Levites who formerly became priests [ received their office ] without [ its being confirmed by the taking of ] an oath , but this One [ was designated ] with an oath through the One who said to Him , “ The Lord has sworn And will not change His mind or regret it , ‘ You ( Christ ) are a Priest forever ’ ” ) . ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	7	22	And so [ because of the oath ’ s greater strength and force ] Jesus has become the certain guarantee of a better covenant [ a more excellent and more advantageous agreement ; one that will never be replaced or annulled ] .
AMP	Hebrews	7	23	The [ former successive line of ] priests , on the one hand , existed in greater numbers because they were each prevented by death from continuing [ perpetually in office ] ;
AMP	Hebrews	7	24	but , on the other hand , Jesus holds His priesthood permanently and without change , because He lives on forever .
AMP	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore He is able also to save forever ( completely , perfectly , for eternity ) those who come to God through Him , since He always lives to intercede and intervene on their behalf [ with God ] .
AMP	Hebrews	7	26	It was fitting for us to have such a High Priest [ perfectly adapted to our needs ] , holy , blameless , unstained [ by sin ] , separated from sinners and exalted higher than the heavens ;

AMP	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; so it is essential for this One also to have something to offer .
AMP	Hebrews	8	4	Now if He were [ still living ] on earth , He would not be a priest at all , for there are priests who offer the gifts [ to God ] in accordance with the Law .
AMP	Hebrews	8	5	They serve as a pattern and foreshadowing of [ what has its true existence and reality in ] the heavenly things ( sanctuary ) . For when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle , he was warned by God , saying , “ See that you make it all [ exactly ] according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain. ” ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	8	6	But as it is , Christ has acquired a [ priestly ] ministry which is more excellent [ than the old Levitical priestly ministry ] , for He is the Mediator ( Arbiter ) of a better covenant [ uniting God and man ] , which has been enacted and rests on better promises . A New Covenant

AMP	Hebrews	9	9	for this [ first or outer tabernacle ] is a symbol [ that is , an archetype or paradigm ] for the present time . Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which are incapable of perfecting the conscience and renewing the [ inner self of the ] worshiper .
AMP	Hebrews	9	2	A tabernacle ( sacred tent ) was put up , the outer one or first section , in which were the lampstand and the table with [ its loaves of ] the sacred showbread ; this is called the Holy Place . ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second veil there was another tabernacle [ the inner one or second section ] known as the Holy of Holies , ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	9	4	[ a ] having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold . This contained a golden jar which held the manna , and the rod of Aaron that sprouted , and the [ two stone ] tablets of the covenant [ inscribed with the Ten Commandments ] ; ( D )
AMP	Hebrews	9	5	and above the ark were the [ golden ] cherubim of glory overshadowing [ b ] the mercy seat ; but we can not now go into detail about these things .
AMP	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things have been prepared in this way , the priests continually enter the outer [ or first section of the ] tabernacle [ that is , the Holy Place ] performing [ their ritual acts of ] the divine worship ,
AMP	Hebrews	9	7	but into the second [ inner tabernacle , the Holy of Holies ] , only the high priest enters [ and then only ] once a year , and never without [ bringing a sacrifice of ] blood , which he offers [ as a substitutionary atonement ] for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance . ( E )
AMP	Hebrews	9	8	By this the Holy Spirit signifies that the way into the Holy Place [ the true Holy of Holies and the presence of God ] has not yet been disclosed as long as the [ c ] first or outer tabernacle is still standing [ that is , as long as the Levitical system of worship remains a recognized institution ] ,
AMP	Hebrews	9	10	For they [ the gifts , sacrifices , and ceremonies ] deal only with [ clean and unclean ] food and drink and various ritual washings , [ mere ] external regulations for the body imposed [ to help the worshipers ] until the time of reformation [ that is , the time of the new order when Christ will establish the reality of what these things foreshadow—a better covenant ] .
AMP	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ appeared as a High Priest of the good things to come [ that is , true spiritual worship ] , He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not a part of this [ material ] creation .
AMP	Hebrews	9	12	He went once for all into the Holy Place [ the Holy of Holies of heaven , into the presence of God ] , and not through the blood of goats and calves , but through His own blood , having obtained and secured eternal redemption [ that is , the salvation of all who personally believe in Him as Savior ] .
AMP	Hebrews	9	13	For if the sprinkling of [ ceremonially ] defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a [ burnt ] heifer is sufficient for the cleansing of the body , ( F )
AMP	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal [ Holy ] Spirit willingly offered Himself unblemished [ that is , without moral or spiritual imperfection as a sacrifice ] to God , cleanse your conscience from dead works and lifeless observances to serve the ever living God ?
AMP	Hebrews	9	15	For this reason He is the Mediator and Negotiator of a new covenant [ that is , an entirely new agreement uniting God and man ] , so that those who have been called [ by God ] may receive [ the fulfillment of ] the promised eternal inheritance , since a death has taken place [ as the payment ] which redeems them from the sins committed under the obsolete first covenant .
AMP	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a will and [ d ] testament involved , the death of the one who made it must be established ,
AMP	Hebrews	9	17	for a will and testament takes effect [ only ] at death , since it is never in force as long as the one who made it is alive .

AMP	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment in the Law had been read by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of the calves and goats [ which had been sacrificed ] , together with water and scarlet wool and with a bunch of hyssop , and he sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people ,
AMP	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ This is the blood of the covenant [ that seals and ratifies the agreement ] which God ordained and commanded [ me to deliver to ] you. ” ( G )
AMP	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the containers and sacred utensils of worship with the blood .
AMP	Hebrews	9	22	In fact under the Law almost everything is cleansed with blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness [ neither release from sin and its guilt , nor cancellation of the merited punishment ] .
AMP	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was necessary for the [ earthly ] copies of the heavenly things to be cleansed with these , but the heavenly things themselves required far better sacrifices than these .
AMP	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with hands , a mere copy of the true one , but [ He entered ] into heaven itself , now to appear in the very presence of God on our behalf ;
AMP	Hebrews	9	25	nor did He [ enter into the heavenly sanctuary to ] offer Himself again and again , as the high priest enters the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own .
AMP	Hebrews	9	26	Otherwise , He would have needed to suffer over and over since the foundation of the world ; but now once for all at the consummation of the ages He has appeared and been publicly manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself .
AMP	Hebrews	9	27	And just as it is appointed and destined for all men to die once and after this [ comes certain ] judgment ,
AMP	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ , having been offered once and once for all to bear [ as a burden ] [ e ] the sins of many , will appear a second time [ when he returns to earth ] , not to deal with sin , but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly and confidently waiting for Him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:4 The Greek participle translated “ having ” probably conveys the notion of “ associated with it ” and hence refers to the fact that the altar of incense , although located in the Holy Place according to Ex 30:6 , here does not refer to location but to use , given the fact that the incense wafted behind the veil into the Holy of Holies . - Hebrews 9:5 I.e . the lid of the ark where blood was sprinkled by the high priest . - Hebrews 9:8 During the age of the old covenant a worshiper had no direct access to God . - Hebrews 9:16 This Greek word may also be translated “ covenant ” as in v

AMP	Hebrews	10	10	And in accordance with this will [ of God ] we [ who believe in the message of salvation ] have been sanctified [ that is , set apart as holy for God and His purposes ] through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ ( the Messiah , the Anointed ) once for all .
AMP	Hebrews	10	2	For if it were otherwise , would not these sacrifices have stopped being offered ? For the worshipers , having once [ for all time ] been cleansed , would no longer have a consciousness of sin .
AMP	Hebrews	10	3	But [ as it is ] these [ continual ] sacrifices bring a fresh reminder of sins [ to be atoned for ] year after year ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	4	for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
AMP	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , when Christ enters into the world , He says , “ Sacrifice and offering You have not desired , But [ instead ] You have prepared a body for Me [ to offer ] ;
AMP	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have taken no delight .
AMP	Hebrews	10	7	“ Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come To do Your will , O God— [ To fulfill ] what is written of Me in the scroll of the book. ’ ” ( A )
AMP	Hebrews	10	8	After saying [ in the citation ] above , “ You have neither desired , nor have You taken delight in sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin ” ( which are offered according to the Law )
AMP	Hebrews	10	9	then He said , “ Behold , I have come to do Your will. ” [ And so ] He does away with the first [ covenant as a means of atoning for sin based on animal sacrifices ] so that He may inaugurate and establish the second [ covenant by means of obedience ] . ( B )
AMP	Hebrews	10	11	Every priest stands [ at his altar of service ] ministering daily , offering the same sacrifices over and over , which are never able [ b ] to strip away sins [ that envelop and cover us ] ;
AMP	Hebrews	10	12	whereas Christ , having offered the one sacrifice [ the all-sufficient sacrifice of Himself ] for sins for all time , sat down [ signifying the completion of atonement for sin ] at the right hand of God [ the position of honor ] ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	13	waiting from that time onward until his enemies are made a footstool for His feet . ( C )
AMP	Hebrews	10	14	For by the one offering He has perfected forever and completely cleansed those who are being sanctified [ bringing each believer to spiritual completion and maturity ] .
AMP	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also adds His testimony to us [ in confirmation of this ] ; for after having said ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days , says the Lord : I will imprint My laws upon their heart , And on their mind I will inscribe them [ producing an inward change ] , ” He then says ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	17	“ And their sins and their lawless acts I will remember no more [ no longer holding their sins against them ] . ” ( D )
AMP	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is [ absolute ] forgiveness and complete cancellation of the penalty of these things , there is no longer any offering [ to be made to atone ] for sin . A New and Living Way
AMP	Hebrews	10	19	Therefore , [ c ] believers , since we have confidence and full freedom to enter the Holy Place [ the place where God dwells ] by [ means of ] the blood of Jesus ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	20	by this new and living way which He initiated and opened for us through the veil [ as in the Holy of Holies ] , that is , through His flesh ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	21	and since we have a great and wonderful Priest [ Who rules ] over the house of God ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	22	let us approach [ God ] with a true and sincere heart in unqualified assurance of faith , having had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
AMP	Hebrews	10	23	Let us seize and hold tightly the confession of our hope without wavering , for He who promised is reliable and trustworthy and faithful [ to His word ] ;
AMP	Hebrews	10	24	and let us consider [ thoughtfully ] how we may encourage one another to love and to do good deeds ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	25	not forsaking our meeting together [ as believers for worship and instruction ] , as is the habit of some , but encouraging one another ; and all the more [ faithfully ] as you see the day [ of Christ ’ s return ] approaching . Christ or Judgment
AMP	Hebrews	10	26	For if we go on willfully and deliberately sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice [ to atone ] for our sins [ that is , no further offering to anticipate ] ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	27	but a kind of awful and terrifying expectation of [ divine ] judgment and the fury of a fire and burning wrath which will consume the adversaries [ those who put themselves in opposition to God ] . ( E )
AMP	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who has ignored and set aside the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses . ( F )
AMP	Hebrews	10	29	How much greater punishment do you think he will deserve who has rejected and trampled under foot the Son of God , and has considered unclean and common the blood of the covenant that [ d ] sanctified him , and has insulted the Spirit of grace [ who imparts the unmerited favor and blessing of God ] ? ( G )
AMP	Hebrews	10	30	For we know Him who said , “ Vengeance is Mine [ retribution and the deliverance of justice rest with Me ] , I will repay [ the wrongdoer ] . ” And again , “ The Lord will judge His people. ” ( H )
AMP	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful and terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God [ incurring His judgment and wrath ] .
AMP	Hebrews	10	32	But remember the earlier days , when , after being [ spiritually ] enlightened , you [ patiently ] endured a great conflict of sufferings ,
AMP	Hebrews	10	33	sometimes by being made a spectacle , publicly exposed to insults and distress , and sometimes by becoming companions with those who were so treated .
AMP	Hebrews	10	34	For you showed sympathy and deep concern for those who were imprisoned , and you joyfully accepted the [ unjust ] seizure of your belongings and the confiscation of your property , conscious of the fact that you have a better possession and a lasting one [ prepared for you in heaven ] .
AMP	Hebrews	10	35	Do not , therefore , fling away your [ fearless ] confidence , for it has a glorious and great reward .
AMP	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of patient endurance [ to bear up under difficult circumstances without compromising ] , so that when you have carried out the will of God , you may receive and enjoy to the full what is promised .
AMP	Hebrews	10	37	For yet in a very little while , He who is coming will come , and will not delay .

AMP	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is to be held in honor among all [ that is , regarded as something of great value ] , and the marriage bed undefiled [ by immorality or by any sexual sin ] ; for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous .
AMP	Hebrews	13	5	Let your character [ your moral essence , your inner nature ] be free from the love of money [ shun greed—be financially ethical ] , being content with what you have ; for He has said , “ I will never [ under any circumstances ] desert you [ nor give you up nor leave you without support , nor will I in any degree leave you helpless ] , nor will I forsake or let you down or relax My hold on you [ assuredly not ] ! ” ( B )

AMP	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is [ eternally changeless , always ] the same yesterday and today and forever .
AMP	Hebrews	13	9	Do not be carried away by diverse and strange teachings ; for it is good for the heart to be established and strengthened by grace and not by foods [ rules of diet and ritualistic meals ] , which bring no benefit or spiritual growth to those who observe them .
AMP	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle ( sacred tent ) have no right to eat .

AMP	James	1	1	[ a ] James , a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , To the twelve [ Hebrew ] tribes [ scattered abroad among the Gentiles ] in the dispersion : Greetings ( rejoice ) !
AMP	James	1	2	Consider it nothing but joy , my [ b ] brothers and sisters , whenever you fall into various trials .
AMP	James	1	3	Be assured that the testing of your faith [ through experience ] produces endurance [ leading to spiritual maturity , and inner peace ] .
AMP	James	1	4	And let endurance have its perfect result and do a thorough work , so that you may be perfect and completely developed [ in your faith ] , lacking in nothing .
AMP	James	1	5	If any of you lacks wisdom [ to guide him through a decision or circumstance ] , he is to ask of [ our benevolent ] God , who gives to everyone generously and without rebuke or blame , and it will be given to him .
AMP	James	1	6	But he must ask [ for wisdom ] in faith , without doubting [ God ’ s willingness to help ] , for the one who doubts is like a billowing surge of the sea that is blown about and tossed by the wind .
AMP	James	1	7	For such a person ought not to think or expect that he will receive anything [ at all ] from the Lord ,
AMP	James	1	8	being a double-minded man , unstable and restless in all his ways [ in everything he thinks , feels , or decides ] .
AMP	James	1	9	Let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position [ as a born-again believer , called to the true riches and to be an heir of God ] ;
AMP	James	1	10	and the rich man is to glory in being humbled [ by trials revealing human frailty , knowing true riches are found in the grace of God ] , for like the flower of the grass he will pass away .
AMP	James	1	11	For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass ; its flower falls off and [ c ] its beauty fades away ; so too will the rich man , in the midst of his pursuits , fade away . ( A )
AMP	James	1	12	Blessed [ happy , spiritually prosperous , favored by God ] is the man who is steadfast under trial and perseveres when tempted ; for when he has passed the test and been approved , he will receive the [ victor ’ s ] crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him .
AMP	James	1	13	Let no one say when he is tempted , “ I am being tempted by God ” [ for temptation does not originate from God , but from our own flaws ] ; for God can not be tempted by [ what is ] evil , and He Himself tempts no one .
AMP	James	1	14	But each one is tempted when he is dragged away , enticed and baited [ to commit sin ] by his own [ worldly ] desire ( lust , passion ) .
AMP	James	1	15	Then when the illicit desire has conceived , it gives birth to sin ; and when sin has run its course , it gives birth to death .
AMP	James	1	16	Do not be misled , my beloved brothers and sisters .
AMP	James	1	17	Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above ; it comes down from the Father of lights [ the Creator and Sustainer of the heavens ] , in whom there is no variation [ no rising or setting ] or shadow [ d ] cast by His turning [ for He is perfect and never changes ] .
AMP	James	1	18	It was of His own will that He gave us birth [ as His children ] by the word of truth , so that we would be a kind of first fruits of His creatures [ a prime example of what He created to be set apart to Himself—sanctified , made holy for His divine purposes ] .
AMP	James	1	19	Understand this , my beloved brothers and sisters . Let everyone be quick to hear [ be a careful , thoughtful listener ] , slow to speak [ a speaker of carefully chosen words and ] , slow to anger [ patient , reflective , forgiving ] ;
AMP	James	1	20	for the [ resentful , deep-seated ] anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God [ that standard of behavior which He requires from us ] .
AMP	James	1	21	So get rid of all uncleanness and [ e ] all that remains of wickedness , and with a humble spirit receive the word [ of God ] which is implanted [ actually rooted in your heart ] , which is able to save your souls .
AMP	James	1	22	But prove yourselves doers of the word [ actively and continually obeying God ’ s precepts ] , and not merely listeners [ who hear the word but fail to internalize its meaning ] , deluding yourselves [ by unsound reasoning contrary to the truth ] .
AMP	James	1	23	For if anyone only listens to the word [ f ] without obeying it , he is like a man who looks very carefully at his natural face in a mirror ;
AMP	James	1	24	for once he has looked at himself and gone away , he immediately forgets [ g ] what he looked like .
AMP	James	1	25	But he who looks carefully into the perfect law , the law of liberty , and faithfully abides by it , not having become a [ careless ] listener who forgets but [ h ] an active doer [ who obeys ] , he will be blessed and favored by God in what he does [ in his life of obedience ] .
AMP	James	1	26	If anyone thinks himself to be religious [ scrupulously observant of the rituals of his faith ] , and does not control his tongue but deludes his own heart , this person ’ s religion is worthless ( futile , barren ) .
AMP	James	1	27	Pure and unblemished religion [ as it is expressed in outward acts ] in the sight of our God and Father is this : to visit and look after the fatherless and the widows in their distress , and to keep oneself uncontaminated by the [ secular ] world .

AMP	James	2	2	For if a man comes into your [ a ] meeting place [ b ] wearing a gold ring and [ c ] fine clothes , and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in ,
AMP	James	2	3	and you pay special attention to the one who wears the [ d ] fine clothes , and say to him , “ You sit here in this good seat , ” and you tell the poor man , “ You stand over there , or sit down [ on the floor ] by my footstool , ”
AMP	James	2	4	have you not discriminated among yourselves , and become judges with wrong motives ?
AMP	James	2	5	Listen , my beloved brothers and sisters : has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and [ as believers to be ] heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him ?
AMP	James	2	6	But you [ in contrast ] have dishonored the poor man . Is it not the rich who oppress and exploit you , and personally drag you into the courts of law ?
AMP	James	2	7	Do they not blaspheme the [ e ] precious name [ of Christ ] by which you are called ?
AMP	James	2	8	If , however , you are [ really ] fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself [ that is , if you have an unselfish concern for others and do things for their benefit ] ” you are doing well . ( A )
AMP	James	2	9	But if you show partiality [ prejudice , favoritism ] , you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as offenders .
AMP	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one point , he has become guilty of [ breaking ] all of it .
AMP	James	2	11	For He who said , “ Do not commit adultery , ” also said , “ Do not murder. ” Now if you do not commit adultery , but you murder , you have become [ f ] guilty of transgressing the [ entire ] Law . ( B )
AMP	James	2	12	Speak and act [ consistently ] as people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty [ that moral law that frees obedient Christians from the bondage of sin ] .
AMP	James	2	13	For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy ; but [ to the one who has shown mercy ] mercy triumphs [ victoriously ] over judgment . Faith and Works
AMP	James	2	14	What is the benefit , my fellow believers , if someone claims to have faith but has no [ good ] works [ as evidence ] ? Can that [ kind of ] faith save him ? [ No , a mere claim of faith is not sufficient—genuine faith produces good works . ]
AMP	James	2	15	If a brother or sister is without [ adequate ] clothing and lacks [ enough ] food for each day ,
AMP	James	2	16	and one of you says to them , “ Go in peace [ with my blessing ] , [ keep ] warm and feed yourselves , ” but he does not give them the necessities for the body , what good does that do ?
AMP	James	2	17	So too , faith , if it does not have works [ to back it up ] , is by itself dead [ inoperative and ineffective ] .
AMP	James	2	18	But someone may say , “ You [ claim to ] have faith and I have [ good ] works ; show me your [ alleged ] faith without the works [ if you can ] , and I will show you my faith by my works [ that is , by what I do ] . ”
AMP	James	2	19	You believe that [ g ] God is one ; you do well [ to believe that ] . The demons also believe [ that ] , and shudder and bristle [ in awe-filled terror—they have seen His wrath ] ! ( C )
AMP	James	2	20	But are you willing to recognize , you foolish [ spiritually shallow ] person , that faith without [ good ] works is useless ?
AMP	James	2	21	Was our father Abraham not [ shown to be ] justified by works [ of obedience which expressed his faith ] when he offered Isaac his son on the altar [ as a sacrifice to God ] ? ( D )
AMP	James	2	22	You see that [ his ] faith was working together with his works , and as a result of the works , his faith was completed [ reaching its maturity when he expressed his faith through obedience ] .
AMP	James	2	23	And the Scripture was fulfilled which says , “ Abraham believed God , and this [ faith ] was credited to him [ by God ] as righteousness and as conformity to His will , ” and he was called the friend of God . ( E )
AMP	James	2	24	You see that a man ( believer ) is justified by works and not by faith alone [ that is , by acts of obedience a born-again believer reveals his faith ] .
AMP	James	2	25	In the same way , was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works too , when she received the [ Hebrew ] [ h ] spies as guests and protected them , and sent them away [ to escape ] by a different route ? ( F )

AMP	James	3	3	Now if we put bits into the horses ’ mouths to make them obey us , we guide their whole body as well .
AMP	James	3	2	For we all stumble and sin in many ways . If anyone does not stumble in what he says [ never saying the wrong thing ] , he is a perfect man [ fully developed in character , without serious flaws ] , able to bridle his whole body and rein in his entire nature [ taming his human faults and weaknesses ] .
AMP	James	3	4	And look at the ships . Even though they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines .
AMP	James	3	5	In the same sense , the tongue is a small part of the body , and yet it boasts of great things . See [ by comparison ] how great a forest is set on fire by a small spark !
AMP	James	3	6	And the tongue is [ in a sense ] a fire , the very world of injustice and unrighteousness ; the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the entire body , and sets on fire the course of our life [ the cycle of man ’ s existence ] , and is itself set on fire by [ b ] hell ( Gehenna ) .
AMP	James	3	7	For every species of beasts and birds , of reptiles and sea creatures , is tamed and has been tamed by the human race .
AMP	James	3	8	But no one can tame the human tongue ; it is a restless evil [ undisciplined , unstable ] , full of deadly poison .
AMP	James	3	9	With it we bless our Lord and Father , and with it we curse men , who have been made in the likeness of God .
AMP	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth come both blessing and cursing . These things , my brothers , should not be this way [ for we have a moral obligation to speak in a manner that reflects our fear of God and profound respect for His precepts ] .
AMP	James	3	11	Does a spring send out from the same opening both [ c ] fresh and bitter water ?
AMP	James	3	12	Can a fig tree , my brothers , produce olives , or a grapevine produce figs ? Nor can salt water produce [ d ] fresh . Wisdom from Above
AMP	James	3	13	Who among you is wise and intelligent ? Let him by his good conduct show his [ good ] deeds with the gentleness and humility of true wisdom .
AMP	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not be arrogant , and [ as a result ] be in defiance of the truth .
AMP	James	3	15	This [ superficial ] wisdom is not that which comes down from above , but is earthly ( secular ) , natural ( unspiritual ) , even demonic .
AMP	James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there is disorder [ unrest , rebellion ] and every evil thing and morally degrading practice .
AMP	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is first pure [ morally and spiritually undefiled ] , then peace-loving [ courteous , considerate ] , gentle , reasonable [ and willing to listen ] , full of compassion and good fruits . It is unwavering , without [ self-righteous ] hypocrisy [ and self-serving guile ] .

AMP	James	5	5	On the earth you have lived luxuriously and abandoned yourselves to soft living and led a life of wanton pleasure [ self-indulgence , self-gratification ] ; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter .
AMP	James	5	2	Your wealth has rotted and is ruined and your [ fine ] clothes have become moth-eaten .
AMP	James	5	3	Your gold and silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire . You have stored up your treasure in the last days [ when it will do you no good ] .

AMP	James	5	6	You have condemned and have put to death the righteous man ; he offers you no resistance . Exhortation
AMP	James	5	7	So wait patiently , brothers and sisters , until the coming of the Lord . The farmer waits [ expectantly ] for the precious harvest from the land , being patient about it , until it receives the early and late rains .
AMP	James	5	8	You too , be patient ; strengthen your hearts [ keep them energized and firmly committed to God ] , because the coming of the Lord is near .
AMP	James	5	9	Do not complain against one another , believers , so that you will not be judged [ for it ] . Look ! The Judge is standing [ b ] right at the door .

AMP	James	5	11	You know we call those blessed [ happy , spiritually prosperous , favored by God ] who were steadfast and endured [ difficult circumstances ] . You have heard of the patient endurance of Job and you have seen the Lord ’ s outcome [ how He richly blessed Job ] . The Lord is full of compassion and is merciful . ( B )
AMP	James	5	12	But above all , my fellow believers , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath ; but let your yes be [ a truthful ] yes , and your no be [ a truthful ] no , so that you may not fall under judgment . ( C )
AMP	James	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering ? He must pray . Is anyone joyful ? He is to sing praises [ to God ] .
AMP	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? He must call for the elders ( spiritual leaders ) of the church and they are to pray over him , anointing him with [ c ] oil in the name of the Lord ;

AMP	James	5	16	Therefore , confess your sins to one another [ your false steps , your offenses ] , and pray for one another , that you may be healed and restored . The heartfelt and persistent prayer of a righteous man ( believer ) can accomplish much [ when put into action and made effective by God—it is dynamic and can have tremendous power ] .

AMP	1%20Peter	3	3	Your adornment must not be merely external—with interweaving and elaborate knotting of the hair , and wearing gold jewelry , or [ being superficially preoccupied with ] dressing in expensive clothes ;
AMP	1%20Peter	3	2	when they see your modest and respectful behavior [ together with your devotion and appreciation—love your husband , encourage him , and enjoy him as a blessing from God ] .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	4	but let it be [ the inner beauty of ] the hidden person of the heart , with the imperishable quality and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit , [ one that is calm and self-controlled , not overanxious , but serene and spiritually mature ] which is very precious in the sight of God .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	5	For in this way in former times the holy women , who hoped in God , used to adorn themselves , being submissive to their own husbands and adapting themselves to them ;
AMP	1%20Peter	3	6	just as Sarah obeyed Abraham [ following him and having regard for him as head of their house ] , calling him [ b ] lord . And you have become her daughters if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear [ that is , being respectful toward your husband but not giving in to intimidation , nor allowing yourself to be led into sin , nor to be harmed ] .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	7	In the same way , you husbands , live with your wives in an understanding way [ with great gentleness and tact , and with an intelligent regard for the marriage relationship ] , as with [ c ] someone physically weaker , since she is a woman . Show her honor and respect as a fellow heir of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered or ineffective .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , all of you be like-minded [ united in spirit ] , sympathetic , brotherly , kindhearted [ courteous and compassionate toward each other as members of one household ] , and humble in spirit ;
AMP	1%20Peter	3	9	and never return evil for evil or insult for insult [ avoid scolding , berating , and any kind of abuse ] , but on the contrary , give a blessing [ pray for one another ’ s well-being , contentment , and protection ] ; for you have been called for this very purpose , that you might inherit a blessing [ from God that brings well-being , happiness , and protection ] .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	10	For , “ The one who wants to enjoy life and see good days [ good—whether apparent or not ] , Must keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from speaking guile ( treachery , deceit ) .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	11	“ He must turn away from wickedness and do what is right . He must search for peace [ with God , with self , with others ] and pursue it eagerly [ actively—not merely desiring it ] .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	12	“ For the eyes of the Lord are [ looking favorably ] upon the righteous ( the upright ) , And His ears are attentive to their prayer ( eager to answer ) , But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil. ” ( B )
AMP	1%20Peter	3	13	Now who is there to hurt you if you become enthusiastic for what is good ?
AMP	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness [ though it is not certain that you will ] , you are still blessed [ happy , to be admired and favored by God ] . Do not be afraid of their intimidating threats , nor be troubled or disturbed [ by their opposition ] .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	15	But in your hearts set Christ apart [ as holy—acknowledging Him , giving Him first place in your lives ] as Lord . Always be ready to give a [ logical ] defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope and confident assurance [ elicited by faith ] that is within you , yet [ do it ] with gentleness and respect . ( C )
AMP	1%20Peter	3	16	And see to it that your conscience is entirely clear , so that every time you are slandered or falsely accused , those who attack or disparage your good behavior in Christ will be shamed [ by their own words ] .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better that you suffer [ unjustly ] for doing what is right , if that should be God ’ s will , than [ to suffer justly ] for doing wrong .
AMP	1%20Peter	3	18	For indeed Christ died for sins once for all , the Just and Righteous for the unjust and unrighteous [ the Innocent for the guilty ] so that He might bring us to God , having been put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the Spirit ;

AMP	1%20John	2	17	The world is passing away , and with it its lusts [ the shameful pursuits and ungodly longings ] ; but the one who does the will of God and carries out His purposes lives forever .

AMP	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us [ seeming at first to be Christians ] , but they were not really of us [ because they were not truly born again and spiritually transformed ] ; for if they had been of us , they would have remained with us ; but they went out [ teaching false doctrine ] , so that it would be clearly shown that none of them are of us .

AMP	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness ; and sin is lawlessness [ ignoring God ’ s law by action or neglect or by tolerating wrongdoing—being unrestrained by His commands and His will ] .

The one who practices righteousness [ the one who strives to live a consistently honorable life—in private as well as in public—and to conform to God ’ s precepts ] is righteous , just as He is righteous .
AMP	1%20John	3	8	The one who practices sin [ separating himself from God , and offending Him by acts of disobedience , indifference , or rebellion ] is of the devil [ and takes his inner character and moral values from him , not God ] ; for the devil has sinned and violated God ’ s law from the beginning . The Son of God appeared for this purpose , to destroy the works of the devil .
AMP	1%20John	3	9	No one who is born of God [ deliberately , knowingly , and habitually ] practices sin , because [ a ] God ’ s seed [ His principle of life , the essence of His righteous character ] remains [ permanently ] in him [ who is born again—who is reborn from above—spiritually transformed , renewed , and set apart for His purpose ] ; and he [ who is born again ] can not habitually [ live a life characterized by ] sin , because he is born of God and longs to please Him .
AMP	1%20John	3	10	By this the children of God and the children of the devil are clearly identified : anyone who does not practice righteousness [ who does not seek God ’ s will in thought , action , and purpose ] is not of God , nor is the one who does not [ unselfishly ] [ b ] love his [ believing ] brother .
AMP	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message which you [ believers ] have heard from the beginning [ of your relationship with Christ ] , that we should [ unselfishly ] love and seek the best for one another ;
AMP	1%20John	3	12	and not be like Cain , who was of the evil one and murdered his brother [ Abel ] . And why did he murder him ? Because Cain ’ s deeds were evil , and his brother ’ s were righteous .
AMP	1%20John	3	13	Do not be surprised , believers , if the world hates you .
AMP	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed out of death into Life , because we love the brothers and sisters . He who does not love remains in [ spiritual ] death .
AMP	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who hates ( works against ) his brother [ in Christ ] is [ at heart ] a murderer [ by God ’ s standards ] ; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him . ( A )
AMP	1%20John	3	16	By this we know [ and have come to understand the depth and essence of His precious ] love : that He [ willingly ] laid down His life for us [ because He loved us ] . And we ought to lay down our lives for the believers .
AMP	1%20John	3	17	But whoever has the [ c ] world ’ s goods ( adequate resources ) , and sees his brother in need , but has no compassion for him , how does the love of God live in him ?
AMP	1%20John	3	18	Little children ( believers , dear ones ) , let us not love [ merely in theory ] with word or with tongue [ giving lip service to compassion ] , but in action and in truth [ in practice and in sincerity , because practical acts of love are more than words ] .
AMP	1%20John	3	19	By this we will know [ without any doubt ] that we are of the truth , and will assure our heart and quiet our conscience before Him
AMP	1%20John	3	20	whenever our heart convicts us [ in guilt ] ; for God is greater than our heart and He knows all things [ nothing is hidden from Him because we are in His hands ] .
AMP	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart does not convict us [ of guilt ] , we have confidence [ complete assurance and boldness ] before God ;
AMP	1%20John	3	22	and we receive from Him whatever we ask because we [ carefully and consistently ] keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight [ habitually seeking to follow His plan for us ] .
AMP	1%20John	3	23	This is His commandment , that we believe [ with personal faith and confident trust ] in the name of His Son Jesus Christ , and [ that we unselfishly ] love and seek the best for one another , just as He commanded us .
AMP	1%20John	3	24	The one who habitually keeps His commandments [ obeying His word and following His precepts , abides and ] remains in Him , and He in him . By this we know and have the proof that He [ really ] abides in us , by the Spirit whom He has given us [ as a gift ] . Footnotes -

AMP	1%20John	5	7	For there are three witnesses :

AMP	Jude	1	3	Beloved , while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation , I was compelled to write to you [ urgently ] appealing that you [ c ] fight strenuously for [ the defense of ] the faith which was once for all [ d ] handed down to the saints [ the faith that is the sum of Christian belief that was given verbally to believers ] .

AMP	Jude	1	8	Nevertheless in the same way , these dreamers [ who are dreaming that God will not punish them ] also defile the body , and reject [ legitimate ] authority , and revile and mock angelic majesties .

This does not mean that true Christians can not or should not engage in spiritual warfare with satanic forces ; quite the contrary ( Eph 6:12 ; James 4:7 ) .

AMP	Revelation	6	7	. - Revelation 6:2 Some interpreters note that the rabbis said that if one sees a white horse in a dream , it is a good sign ( Talmud ) . Jewish believers who heard these words being read in their church ( see 1:3 ) probably would think that the vision indicated Israel would soon be freed from foreign domination . In the Roman world a white horse was a symbol of victory in battle . In this case the peace is deceptive because it will not be lasting . Other interpreters argue that the horseman represents the conquering Christ , as in 19:11 . - Revelation 6:2 Without an arrow ( if arrows are not to be assumed ) the bow may symbolize a bloodless victory or conquest . - Revelation 6:4 In contrast to the white horse , the rabbis said that if one saw a red horse walking gently , it was a good sign , but if the horse was galloping , it was a bad sign . It was also said that the man riding the red horse in Zechariah ’ s vision ( Zech 1:8 ) was a sign that God intended to turn the whole world into blood ( Talmud ) . - Revelation 6:6 This may be a warning to be very careful handling olive oil and wine , which ordinarily are basic commodities , because famine will make them very expensive . The vision indicates that famine and inflation will take such a toll that a laborer will earn only enough to feed himself with wheat , or to provide barley for a small family . He will have almost nothing left for clothing , shelter , and incidentals . - Revelation 6:8 Or death . - Revelation 6:12 This was a coarse , uncomfortable material usually made of black goat hair and customarily worn as a sign of mourning or repentance . - Revelation 6:15 Lit chiliarchs , a Greek word literally meaning a ruler ( commander ) of a thousand men , but used generally of high-ranking military officers .

Daniel ’ s description reveals that the ten horns are ten kings who temporarily reign with the Antichrist during the Great Tribulation ( cf 17:12 ) . - Revelation 12:5 This refers to the ascension of Christ to heaven following His death and resurrection . - Revelation 12:9 The Greek for devil is diabolos , which is actually a translation of Satan , a Hebrew word meaning “ adversary ” or “ accuser. ” The Greek word additionally carries with it the concept of “ slanderer. ” See note v

AMP	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom . Let the person who has enough insight calculate the number of the beast , for it is the [ imperfect ] number of a man ; [ g ] and his number is [ h ] six hundred and sixty-six . Footnotes - Revelation 13:1 The dragon , who is Satan , stands at the head of an unholy , idolatrous trinity , comprised also of the first beast , who is the Antichrist ( vv 1-10 ) and has a healed wound , and the second beast , who is the false prophet and deceives unbelievers to worship Antichrist through false signs ( vv 11-18 ) . - Revelation 13:1 The symbol of political , royal , or military power . - Revelation 13:2 These animals are mentioned in Dan 7:4-6 , where the leopard represents Greece , the bear Medo-Persia , and the lion Babylon . - Revelation 13:5 The last half of the Tribulation . - Revelation 13:7 Lit given . - Revelation 13:11 See note v
AMP	Revelation	13	1	. - Revelation 13:18 Regardless of the earthly power of the two beasts ( the demonically controlled Antichrist/dictator and his false prophet ) described in these verses , they and their mentor , Satan , fall far short of the power , perfection , and majesty of God the Father , God the Son , and God the Holy Spirit , whose perfection is represented biblically by the number seven . - Revelation 13:18 This is not actually three sixes ( or the equivalent in Greek or Hebrew letters ) , as commonly represented . Such a combination would not be used ; and if it were , the sum would then be only eighteen , because in alphabet-based numbering systems like ancient Hebrew and Greek , place values are not used (
AMP	Revelation	13	100	’ s etc . ) , but the letters are treated more like Roman numerals . What John is most likely indicating is that the letters of the name will add up to
AMP	Revelation	13	666	when transliterated to Hebrew as NRWN QSR ( according to the Greek form ) ; but in the Talmud , the name is transliterated as NYRWN QYSR , which totals
AMP	Revelation	13	686	. Also , the original Latin form of the name ( without the second “ n ” ) , if converted directly to Hebrew , adds up to

AMP	Revelation	14	3	And they sang a new song before the throne [ of God ] and before the four living creatures and the elders ; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased ( ransomed , redeemed ) from the earth . ( B )
AMP	Revelation	14	4	These are the ones who have not been defiled [ by relations ] with women , for they are celibate . These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes .

AMP	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven , with an [ a ] eternal gospel to preach to the inhabitants of the earth , to every nation and tribe and language and people ; ( D )
AMP	Revelation	14	7	and he said with a loud voice , “ Fear God [ with awe and reverence ] , and give Him glory [ and honor and praise in worship ] , because the hour of His judgment has come ; [ with all your heart ] worship Him who created the heaven and the earth , the sea and the springs of water. ” Doom for Proud Babylon
AMP	Revelation	14	8	Then another angel , a second one , followed , saying , “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , she who has made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality [ corrupting them with idolatry ] . ” ( E ) Doom for Worshipers of the Beast
AMP	Revelation	14	9	Then another angel , a third one , followed them , saying with a loud voice , “ Whoever worships the beast and his image and receives the mark [ of the beast ] on his forehead or on his hand ,
AMP	Revelation	14	10	he too will [ have to ] drink of the wine of the wrath of God , [ b ] mixed undiluted into the cup of His anger ; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone ( flaming sulfur ) in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb ( Christ ) . ( F )
AMP	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever ; and they have no rest day and night—those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name. ” ( G )
AMP	Revelation	14	12	Here is [ encouragement for ] the steadfast endurance of the saints ( God ’ s people ) , those who habitually keep God ’ s commandments and their faith in Jesus .
AMP	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard [ the distinct words of ] a voice from heaven , saying , “ Write , ‘ [ c ] Blessed ( happy , prosperous , to be admired ) are the dead who die in the Lord from now on ! ’ ” “ Yes , [ blessed indeed ] , ” says the Spirit , “ so that they may rest and have relief from their labors , for their deeds do follow them. ” The Reapers
AMP	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple , calling with a loud voice to Him who was sitting upon the cloud , “ Put in Your sickle and reap [ at once ] , for the hour to reap [ in judgment ] has arrived , because the earth ’ s harvest is fully ripened. ” ( I )
AMP	Revelation	14	16	So He who was sitting on the cloud cast His sickle over the earth , and the earth was reaped ( judged ) .
AMP	Revelation	14	17	Then another angel came out of the temple ( sanctuary ) in heaven , and he also had a sharp sickle .
AMP	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came from the altar , the one who has power over fire ; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle , saying , “ Put in your sharp sickle and reap the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth , because her grapes are ripe [ for judgment ] . ” ( J )
AMP	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and harvested the grapevine of the earth , and threw the grapes into the great wine press of the wrath and indignation of God [ as judgment of the rebellious world ] . ( K )
AMP	Revelation	14	20	And the grapes in the wine press were trampled and crushed outside the city , and blood poured from the wine press , reaching up to the horses ’ bridles , for a distance of [ d ] sixteen hundred stadia .

( A )
AMP	Revelation	15	2	Then I saw something like a sea or large expanse of glass mixed with fire , and those who were victorious over the beast and over his image and over the number corresponding to his name were standing on the sea or large expanse of glass , holding harps of God [ worshiping Him ] . ( B )
AMP	Revelation	15	3	And they [ a ] sang the song of Moses , the bond-servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , “ Great and wonderful and awe-inspiring are Your works [ in judgment ] , O Lord God , the Almighty [ the Omnipotent , the Ruler of all ] ; Righteous and true are Your ways , O King of the [ b ] nations !
