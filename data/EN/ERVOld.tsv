ERV	Genesis	1	6	Then God said , “ Let there be a space [ c ] to separate the water into two parts ! ”
ERV	Genesis	1	7	So God made the space and separated the water . Some of the water was above it , and some of the water was below it .
ERV	Genesis	1	8	God named that space “ sky. ” There was evening , and then there was morning . This was the second day . The Third Day—Dry Land and Plants

ERV	Genesis	1	15	They will be in the sky to shine light on the earth. ” And it happened .
ERV	Genesis	1	16	So God made the two large lights . He made the larger light to rule during the day and the smaller light to rule during the night . He also made the stars .
ERV	Genesis	1	17	God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth .

ERV	Genesis	1	22	God blessed all the living things in the sea and told them to have many babies and fill the seas . And he blessed the birds on land and told them to have many more babies .

ERV	Genesis	1	27	So God created humans in his own image . He created them to be like himself . [ h ] He created them male and female .
ERV	Genesis	1	28	God blessed them and said to them , “ Have many children . Fill the earth and take control of it . Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the air . Rule over every living thing that moves on the earth. ”

ERV	Genesis	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and made it a holy day . He made it special because on that day he rested from all the work he did while creating the world . The First Man and the Garden of Eden
ERV	Genesis	2	4	This is the story about the creation of the sky and the earth . This is what happened when the Lord God made the earth and the sky .
ERV	Genesis	2	5	This was before there were plants on the earth . Nothing was growing in the fields because the Lord God had not yet made it rain on the earth , and there was no one to care for the plants .
ERV	Genesis	2	6	So water [ a ] came up from the earth and spread over the ground .
ERV	Genesis	2	7	Then the Lord God took dust from the ground and made a man . [ b ] He breathed the breath of life into the man ’ s nose , and the man became a living thing .
ERV	Genesis	2	8	Then the Lord God planted a garden in the East , [ c ] in a place named Eden . He put the man he made in that garden .
ERV	Genesis	2	9	Then the Lord God caused all the beautiful trees that were good for food to grow in the garden . In the middle of the garden , he put the tree of life and the tree that gives knowledge about good and evil .
ERV	Genesis	2	10	A river flowed from Eden and watered the garden . The river then separated and became four smaller rivers .
ERV	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first river was Pishon . This river flowed around the entire country of Havilah . [ d ]
ERV	Genesis	2	12	( There is gold in that country , and that gold is pure . A kind of expensive perfume and onyx are also found there . )

ERV	Genesis	2	14	The name of the third river was Tigris . This river flowed east of Assyria . The fourth river was the Euphrates .
ERV	Genesis	2	15	The Lord God put the man in the Garden of Eden to work the soil and take care of the garden .
ERV	Genesis	2	16	The Lord God gave him this command : “ You may eat from any tree in the garden .
ERV	Genesis	2	17	But you must not eat from the tree that gives knowledge about good and evil . If you eat fruit from that tree , on that day you will certainly die ! ” A Companion for Adam
ERV	Genesis	2	18	Then the Lord God said , “ I see that it is not good for the man to be alone . I will make the companion he needs , one just right for him. ”
ERV	Genesis	2	19	The Lord God used dust from the ground and made every animal in the fields and every bird in the air . He brought all these animals to the man , and the man gave them all a name .
ERV	Genesis	2	20	The man gave names to all the tame animals , to all the birds in the air , and to all the wild animals . He saw many animals and birds , but he could not find a companion that was right for him .
ERV	Genesis	2	21	So the Lord God caused the man to sleep very deeply . While he was asleep , God took one of the ribs from the man ’ s body . Then he closed the man ’ s skin where the rib had been .
ERV	Genesis	2	22	The Lord God used the rib from the man to make a woman . Then he brought the woman to the man .
ERV	Genesis	2	23	And the man said , “ Finally ! One like me , with bones from my bones and a body from my body . She was taken out of a man , so I will call her ‘ woman. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	2	24	That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife . In this way two people become one .
ERV	Genesis	2	25	The man and his wife were naked , but they were not ashamed .

ERV	Genesis	3	3	But there is one tree we must not eat from . God told us , ‘ You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden . You must not even touch that tree , or you will die. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	3	2	The woman answered the snake , “ No , we can eat fruit from the trees in the garden .
ERV	Genesis	3	4	But the snake said to the woman , “ You will not die .
ERV	Genesis	3	5	God knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree you will learn about good and evil , and then you will be like God ! ”
ERV	Genesis	3	6	The woman could see that the tree was beautiful and the fruit looked so good to eat . She also liked the idea that it would make her wise . So she took some of the fruit from the tree and ate it . Her husband was there with her , so she gave him some of the fruit , and he ate it .
ERV	Genesis	3	7	Then it was as if their eyes opened , and they saw things differently . They saw that they were naked . So they got some fig leaves , sewed them together , and wore them for clothes .
ERV	Genesis	3	8	During the cool part of the day , the Lord God was walking in the garden . The man and the woman heard him , and they hid among the trees in the garden .
ERV	Genesis	3	9	The Lord God called to the man and said , “ Where are you ? ”
ERV	Genesis	3	10	The man said , “ I heard you walking in the garden , and I was afraid . I was naked , so I hid. ”
ERV	Genesis	3	11	God said to the man , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Did you eat fruit from that special tree ? I told you not to eat from that tree ! ”
ERV	Genesis	3	12	The man said , “ The woman you put here with me gave me fruit from that tree . So I ate it. ”
ERV	Genesis	3	13	Then the Lord God said to the woman , “ What have you done ? ” She said , “ The snake tricked me , so I ate the fruit. ”
ERV	Genesis	3	14	So the Lord God said to the snake , “ You did this very bad thing , so bad things will happen to you . It will be worse for you than for any other animal . You must crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life .
ERV	Genesis	3	15	I will make you and the woman enemies to each other . Your children and her children will be enemies . You will bite her child ’ s foot , but he will crush your head. ”
ERV	Genesis	3	16	Then God said to the woman , “ I will cause you to have much trouble when you are pregnant . And when you give birth to children , you will have much pain . You will want your husband very much , but he will rule over you. ” [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	3	17	Then God said to the man , “ I commanded you not to eat from that tree . But you listened to your wife and ate from it . So I will curse the ground because of you . You will have to work hard all your life for the food the ground produces .
ERV	Genesis	3	18	The ground will grow thorns and weeds for you . And you will have to eat the plants that grow wild in the fields . [ b ]
ERV	Genesis	3	19	You will work hard for your food , until your face is covered with sweat . You will work hard until the day you die , and then you will become dust again . I used dust to make you , and when you die , you will become dust again. ”
ERV	Genesis	3	20	Adam [ c ] named his wife Eve . [ d ] He gave her this name because Eve would be the mother of everyone who ever lived .
ERV	Genesis	3	21	The Lord God used animal skins and made some clothes for the man and his wife . Then he put the clothes on them .
ERV	Genesis	3	22	The Lord God said , “ Look , the man has become like us—he knows about good and evil . And now the man might take the fruit from the tree of life . If the man eats that fruit , he will live forever. ”
ERV	Genesis	3	23	So the Lord God forced the man out of the Garden of Eden to work the ground he was made from .
ERV	Genesis	3	24	God forced the man to leave the garden . Then he put Cherub angels and a sword of fire at the entrance to the garden to protect it .

[ c ] The Lord accepted Abel and his gift .
ERV	Genesis	4	5	But he did not accept Cain and his offering . Cain was sad because of this , and he became very angry .
ERV	Genesis	4	6	The Lord asked Cain , “ Why are you angry ? Why does your face look sad ?
ERV	Genesis	4	7	You know that if you do what is right , I will accept you . But if you don ’ t , sin is ready to attack you . That sin will want to control you , but you must control it. ” [ d ]
ERV	Genesis	4	8	Cain said to his brother Abel , “ Let ’ s go out to the field. ” [ e ] So they went to the field . Then Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him .
ERV	Genesis	4	9	Later , the Lord said to Cain , “ Where is your brother Abel ? ” Cain answered , “ I don ’ t know . Is it my job to watch over my brother ? ” 10-11 Then the Lord said , “ What have you done ? You killed your brother and the ground opened up to take his blood from your hands . Now his blood is shouting to me from the ground . So you will be cursed from this ground .
ERV	Genesis	4	12	Now when you work the soil , the ground will not help your plants grow . You will not have a home in this land . You will wander from place to place. ”
ERV	Genesis	4	13	Then Cain said to the Lord , “ This punishment is more than I can bear !
ERV	Genesis	4	14	You are forcing me to leave the land , and I will not be able to be near you or have a home ! Now I must wander from place to place , and anyone I meet could kill me. ”

ERV	Genesis	8	2	Rain stopped falling from the sky , and water stopped flowing from under the earth . 3-4 The water that covered the earth began to go down . After
ERV	Genesis	8	150	days the water was low enough that the boat touched land again . The boat stopped on one of the mountains of Ararat . This was the 17th day of the seventh month .
ERV	Genesis	8	5	The water continued to go down , and by the first day of the tenth month , the tops of the mountains were above the water .
ERV	Genesis	8	6	Forty days later Noah opened the window he had made in the boat .
ERV	Genesis	8	7	Then he sent out a raven . The raven flew from place to place until the ground was dry and the water was gone .
ERV	Genesis	8	9	The dove could not find a place to rest because water still covered the earth , so the dove came back to the boat . Noah reached out his hand and caught the dove and brought it back into the boat .
ERV	Genesis	8	10	After seven days Noah again sent out the dove .
ERV	Genesis	8	11	And that afternoon the dove came back to Noah . The dove had a fresh olive leaf in its mouth . This was a sign to show Noah that there was dry ground on the earth .
ERV	Genesis	8	12	Seven days later Noah sent the dove out again . But this time the dove didn ’ t come back .
ERV	Genesis	8	13	After that Noah opened the door [ a ] of the boat . He looked and saw that the ground was dry . This was the first day of the first month of the year . He was
ERV	Genesis	8	601	years old .
ERV	Genesis	8	14	By the 27th day of the second month , the ground was completely dry .
ERV	Genesis	8	15	Then God said to Noah ,
ERV	Genesis	8	16	“ Leave the boat . You , your wife , your sons , and your sons ’ wives should go out now .
ERV	Genesis	8	17	Bring every living animal out of the boat with you—all the birds , animals , and everything that crawls on the earth . These animals will make many more animals , and they will fill the earth again. ”
ERV	Genesis	8	18	So Noah went out with his sons , his wife , and his sons ’ wives .
ERV	Genesis	8	19	All the animals , everything that crawls , and every bird left the boat . All the animals came out of the boat in family groups .
ERV	Genesis	8	20	Then Noah built an altar to honor the Lord . Noah took some of all the clean birds and some of all the clean animals and burned them on the altar as a gift to God .
ERV	Genesis	8	21	The Lord smelled these sacrifices , and it pleased him . The Lord said to himself , “ I will never again curse the earth as a way to punish people . People are evil from the time they are young , but I will never again destroy every living thing on the earth as I did this time .

ERV	Genesis	9	3	In the past , I gave you the green plants to eat . Now every animal will also be food for you . I give you everything on earth—it is yours .
ERV	Genesis	9	4	But I give you one command . You must not eat meat that still has its life ( blood ) in it .
ERV	Genesis	9	5	Also , I will demand your blood for your lives . That is , I will demand the life of any person or animal that takes a human life .
ERV	Genesis	9	6	“ God made humans to be like himself . So whoever kills a person must be killed by another person .
ERV	Genesis	9	7	“ Have many children and fill the earth with your people. ”
ERV	Genesis	9	8	Then God said to Noah and his sons ,
ERV	Genesis	9	10	I make my promise to all the birds , and to all the cattle , and to all the animals that came out of the boat with you . I make my promise to every living thing on earth .
ERV	Genesis	9	11	This is my promise to you : All life on the earth was destroyed by the flood . But that will never happen again . A flood will never again destroy all life on the earth. ”
ERV	Genesis	9	12	And God said , “ I will give you something to prove that I made this promise to you . It will continue forever to show that I have made an agreement with you and every living thing on earth .
ERV	Genesis	9	13	I am putting a rainbow in the clouds as proof of the agreement between me and the earth .
ERV	Genesis	9	14	When I bring clouds over the earth , you will see the rainbow in the clouds .
ERV	Genesis	9	15	When I see this rainbow , I will remember the agreement between me and you and every living thing on the earth . This agreement says that a flood will never again destroy all life on the earth .
ERV	Genesis	9	16	When I look and see the rainbow in the clouds , I will remember the agreement that continues forever . I will remember the agreement between me and every living thing on the earth. ”
ERV	Genesis	9	17	So God said to Noah , “ This rainbow is proof of the agreement that I made with all living things on earth. ” Problems Begin Again

ERV	Genesis	9	22	Ham , the father of Canaan , saw that his father was naked and told his brothers who were outside the tent .
ERV	Genesis	9	23	Shem and Japheth took a robe , put it across their shoulders , and walked backward into the tent . Then they covered their father without looking at him .
ERV	Genesis	9	24	Later , Noah woke up . ( He was sleeping because of the wine . ) When he learned what his youngest son Ham had done to him ,
ERV	Genesis	9	25	he said , “ May there be a curse on Canaan [ a ] ! May he be a slave to his brothers. ”
ERV	Genesis	9	26	Noah also said , “ May the Lord , the God of Shem , be praised ! May Canaan be Shem ’ s slave .
ERV	Genesis	9	27	May God give more land to Japheth . May God live in Shem ’ s tents , and may Canaan be their slave. ”

ERV	Genesis	12	7	The Lord appeared [ a ] to Abram and said , “ I will give this land to your descendants. ” Abram built an altar to honor the Lord who appeared to him there .

ERV	Genesis	12	13	So tell them that you are my sister . Then they will be good to me because of you . In this way you will save my life. ”

ERV	Genesis	13	5	During this time Lot was also traveling with Abram . Lot had many animals and tents .
ERV	Genesis	13	6	Abram and Lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together .
ERV	Genesis	13	7	( The Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in this land at the same time . ) The shepherds of Abram and Lot began to argue .
ERV	Genesis	13	8	So Abram said to Lot , “ There should be no arguing between you and me or between your people and my people . We are all brothers .
ERV	Genesis	13	9	We should separate . You can choose any place you want . If you go to the left , I will go to the right . If you go to the right , I will go to the left. ”

ERV	Genesis	13	12	Abram stayed in the land of Canaan , and Lot lived among the cities in the valley . Lot moved as far as Sodom and made his camp there .
ERV	Genesis	13	14	After Lot left , the Lord said to Abram , “ Look around you . Look north , south , east , west .
ERV	Genesis	13	15	All this land that you see I will give to you and your people who live after you . This will be your land forever .
ERV	Genesis	13	16	I will make your people so many that they will be like the dust of the earth . If people could count all the particles of dust on earth , they could count your people .
ERV	Genesis	13	17	So go . Walk through your land . I now give it to you. ”
ERV	Genesis	13	18	So Abram moved his tents . He went to live near the big trees of Mamre . This was near the city of Hebron . There he built an altar to honor the Lord . Footnotes - Genesis 13:3 Ai The name of this town means “ the ruins . ”
ERV	Genesis	14	14	When Abram learned that Lot was captured , he called all of his family together . There were

ERV	Genesis	14	4	These kings had served Kedorlaomer for twelve years . But in the 13th year , they all rebelled against him .
ERV	Genesis	14	5	So in the 14th year , King Kedorlaomer and the kings with him came to fight against them . Kedorlaomer and the kings with him defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim . They also defeated the Zuzites in Ham . They defeated the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim .
ERV	Genesis	14	6	And they defeated the Horites who lived in the area from the hill country of Seir [ a ] to El Paran . [ b ] ( El Paran is near the desert . )
ERV	Genesis	14	7	Then King Kedorlaomer turned back , went to En Mishpat ( that is , Kadesh ) , and defeated the Amalekites . He also defeated the Amorites living in Hazezon Tamar .
ERV	Genesis	14	8	At that time the kings of Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah , Zeboiim , and Bela ( Zoar ) joined together to fight against their enemies in the Valley of Siddim . [ c ]
ERV	Genesis	14	9	They fought against King Kedorlaomer of Elam , King Tidal of Goiim , King Amraphel of Babylonia , and King Arioch of Ellasar . So there were four kings fighting against five .
ERV	Genesis	14	10	There were many holes filled with tar in the Valley of Siddim . When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and their armies ran away , some of the soldiers fell into these holes , but the others ran away to the mountains .
ERV	Genesis	14	11	So Kedorlaomer and his armies took everything that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah owned . They took all their food and clothing and left .
ERV	Genesis	14	12	Lot , the son of Abram ’ s brother , was living in Sodom , and they captured him . They also took everything he owned and left .
ERV	Genesis	14	13	One of the men who had escaped went to Abram the Hebrew and told him what happened . Abram was camped near the trees of Mamre the Amorite . Mamre , Eshcol , and Aner [ d ] had made an agreement to help each other , and they had also signed an agreement to help Abram . Abram Rescues Lot

ERV	Genesis	14	15	That night he and his men made a surprise attack against the enemy . They defeated them and chased them to Hobah , north of Damascus .
ERV	Genesis	14	16	Then Abram brought back everything the enemy had stolen , as well as the women and servants , his nephew Lot , and everything Lot owned .
ERV	Genesis	14	17	Then Abram went home after he defeated Kedorlaomer and the kings with him . On his way home , the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh . ( This is now called King ’ s Valley . ) Melchizedek
ERV	Genesis	14	18	Melchizedek , the king of Salem and a priest of God Most High , also went to meet Abram . He brought bread and wine .
ERV	Genesis	14	19	He blessed Abram and said , “ Abram , may you be blessed by God Most High , the one who made heaven and earth .
ERV	Genesis	14	20	And we praise God Most High , who helped you defeat your enemies. ” Abram gave Melchizedek one-tenth of everything he had taken during the battle .
ERV	Genesis	14	21	Then the king of Sodom told Abram , “ Give me my people who were captured . But you can keep everything else. ”
ERV	Genesis	14	22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom , “ I promise to the Lord , the God Most High , the one who made heaven and earth .
ERV	Genesis	14	23	I promise that I will not keep anything that is yours—not even a thread or a sandal strap ! I don ’ t want you to say , ‘ I made Abram rich. ’
ERV	Genesis	14	24	The only thing I will accept is the food that my young men have eaten , but you should give the other men their share . Take what we won in battle and give some to Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre . These men helped me in the battle. ” Footnotes - Genesis 14:6 Seir Or “ Edom. ” - Genesis 14:6 El Paran Probably the town Elath , at the southern tip of Israel near the Red Sea . - Genesis 14:8 Valley of Siddim The valley or plain along the eastern or southeastern side of the Dead Sea . - Genesis 14:13 Mamre … Aner Literally , “ Mamre … was a brother of Eshcol and a brother of Aner . ”
ERV	Genesis	15	15	“ You yourself will live to be very old . You will die in peace and will be buried with your family .
ERV	Genesis	15	2	But Abram said , “ Lord God , there is nothing you can give me that will make me happy , because I have no son . My slave Eliezer from Damascus will get everything I own after I die. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	3	Abram said , “ You have given me no son , so a slave born in my house will get everything I have. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	4	Then the Lord spoke to Abram and said , “ That slave will not be the one to get what you have . You will have a son who will get everything you own. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	5	Then God led Abram outside and said , “ Look at the sky . See the many stars . There are so many you can not count them . Your family will be like that. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	6	Abram believed the Lord , and because of this faith the Lord accepted him as one who has done what is right .
ERV	Genesis	15	7	He said to Abram , “ I am the Lord who led you from Ur of Babylonia . [ a ] I did this so that I could give you this land . You will own this land. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	8	But Abram said , “ Lord God , how can I be sure that I will get this land ? ”
ERV	Genesis	15	9	God said to Abram , “ We will make an agreement . Bring me a three-year-old cow , a three-year-old goat , a three-year-old ram , a dove , and a young pigeon. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	10	Abram brought all these to God . Abram killed these animals and cut each of them into two pieces . Then he laid each half across from the other half . He did not cut the birds into two pieces .
ERV	Genesis	15	11	Later , large birds flew down to eat the animals , but Abram chased them away .
ERV	Genesis	15	12	The sun began to go down and Abram got very sleepy . While he was asleep , a very terrible darkness came over him .
ERV	Genesis	15	13	Then the Lord said to Abram , “ You should know this : Your descendants will live in a country that is not their own . They will be strangers there . The people there will make them slaves and be cruel to them for

ERV	Genesis	15	14	But then I will punish the nation that made them slaves . Your people will leave that land , and they will take many good things with them .
ERV	Genesis	15	16	After four generations your people will come to this land again and defeat the Amorites . That will happen in the future because the Amorites are not yet guilty enough to lose their land. ”
ERV	Genesis	15	17	After the sun went down , it got very dark . The dead animals were still on the ground , each animal cut into two pieces . Then a smoking firepot [ b ] and a flaming torch passed between the halves of the dead animals . [ c ]
ERV	Genesis	15	18	So on that day the Lord made a promise and an agreement with Abram . He said , “ I will give this land to your descendants . I will give them the land between the River of Egypt [ d ] and the great river Euphrates .
ERV	Genesis	15	19	This is the land of the Kenites , Kenizzites , Kadmonites ,
ERV	Genesis	15	20	Hittites , Perizzites , Rephaites ,

People showed that they were sincere in making an agreement by walking between the parts of animals that had been cut into pieces and saying something like , “ May this same thing happen to me if I don ’ t keep the agreement. ” - Genesis 15:18 River of Egypt That is , the stream called “ Wadi El-Arish . ”
ERV	Genesis	16	16	Abram was
ERV	Genesis	16	2	Sarai told Abram , “ The Lord has not allowed me to have children , so sleep with my slave . Maybe she can have a son , and I will accept him as my own. ” Abram did what Sarai said .
ERV	Genesis	16	3	So after living ten years in the land of Canaan , Sarai gave her Egyptian slave to Abram as a second wife .
ERV	Genesis	16	4	Abram slept with Hagar , and she became pregnant . When Hagar realized this , she became very proud and began to feel that she was better than Sarai her owner .
ERV	Genesis	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram , “ My slave girl now hates me , and I blame you for this . I gave her to you , and she became pregnant . Then she began to feel that she is better than I am . I want the Lord to judge which of us is right. ”
ERV	Genesis	16	6	But Abram said to Sarai , “ She is your slave . You can do anything you want to her. ” So Sarai was cruel to Hagar , and Hagar ran away . Hagar ’ s Son Ishmael
ERV	Genesis	16	7	The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring of water in the desert . The spring was by the road to Shur .
ERV	Genesis	16	8	The angel said , “ Hagar , Sarai ’ s slave girl , why are you here ? Where are you going ? ” Hagar said , “ I am running away from Sarai. ”
ERV	Genesis	16	9	The angel of the Lord said to her , “ Sarai is your owner . Go home to her and obey her. ”
ERV	Genesis	16	10	The angel of the Lord also said , “ From you will come many people—too many people to count. ”
ERV	Genesis	16	11	Then the angel of the Lord said , “ Hagar , you are now pregnant , and you will have a son . You will name him Ishmael , [ a ] because the Lord has heard that you were treated badly .
ERV	Genesis	16	12	Ishmael will be wild and free like a wild donkey . He will be against everyone , and everyone will be against him . He will move from place to place and camp near his brothers. ”
ERV	Genesis	16	13	The Lord talked to Hagar . She began to use a new name for God . She said to him , “ You are ‘ God Who Sees Me. ’ ” She said this because she thought , “ I see that even in this place God sees me and cares for me ! ”
ERV	Genesis	16	14	So the well there was called Beer Lahai Roi . [ b ] It is between Kadesh and Bered .
ERV	Genesis	16	15	Hagar gave birth to Abram ’ s son , and Abram named the son Ishmael .
ERV	Genesis	16	86	years old when Ishmael was born from Hagar . Footnotes - Genesis 16:11 Ishmael This name means “ God hears. ” - Genesis 16:14 Beer Lahai Roi This means “ The well of the Living One who sees me . ”
ERV	Genesis	17	17	Abraham bowed his face to the ground to show he respected God . But he laughed and said to himself , “ I am
ERV	Genesis	17	99	years old when he was circumcised .
ERV	Genesis	17	2	If you do this , I will prepare an agreement between us . I will promise to make your people a great nation. ”
ERV	Genesis	17	3	Then Abram bowed down before God . God said to him ,
ERV	Genesis	17	4	“ This is my part of our agreement : I will make you the father of many nations .
ERV	Genesis	17	5	I will change your name from Abram [ b ] to Abraham , [ c ] because I am making you the father of many nations .
ERV	Genesis	17	6	I will give you many descendants . New nations and kings will come from you .
ERV	Genesis	17	7	And I will prepare an agreement between me and you . This agreement will also be for all your descendants . It will continue forever . I will be your God and the God of all your descendants .
ERV	Genesis	17	8	And I will give this land to you and to all your descendants . I will give you the land you are traveling through—the land of Canaan . I will give you this land forever , and I will be your God. ”
ERV	Genesis	17	9	Then God said to Abraham , “ Now , this is your part of the agreement : You and all your descendants will obey my agreement .
ERV	Genesis	17	10	This is my agreement that all of you must obey . This is the agreement between me and you and all your descendants . Every male must be circumcised .
ERV	Genesis	17	11	You will cut the skin to show that you follow the agreement between me and you .
ERV	Genesis	17	12	When the baby boy is eight days old , you will circumcise him . Every boy born among your people and every boy who is a slave of your people must be circumcised .
ERV	Genesis	17	13	years old when he was circumcised .
ERV	Genesis	17	14	Abraham , this is the agreement between you and me : Any male who is not circumcised will be cut off from his people [ d ] because he has broken my agreement. ” Isaac—the Promised Son
ERV	Genesis	17	15	God said to Abraham , “ I will give Sarai , [ e ] your wife , a new name . Her new name will be Sarah . [ f ]
ERV	Genesis	17	16	I will bless her . I will give her a son , and you will be the father . She will be the mother of many new nations . Kings of nations will come from her. ”
ERV	Genesis	17	100	years old . I can not have a son , and Sarah is
ERV	Genesis	17	90	years old . She can not have a child. ”
ERV	Genesis	17	18	Then Abraham said to God , “ I hope Ishmael will live and serve you. ”
ERV	Genesis	17	19	God said , “ No , I said that your wife Sarah will have a son . You will name him Isaac . [ g ] I will make my agreement with him that will continue forever with all his descendants .
ERV	Genesis	17	20	“ You mentioned Ishmael , and I heard you . I will bless him , and he will have many children . He will be the father of twelve great leaders . His family will become a great nation .
ERV	Genesis	17	21	But I will make my agreement with Isaac , the son who Sarah will have . He will be born at this same time next year. ”
ERV	Genesis	17	22	After God finished talking with Abraham , God went up into heaven .
ERV	Genesis	17	23	Then Abraham gathered together Ishmael and all the slaves born in his house . He also gathered all the slaves he had bought . Every man and boy in Abraham ’ s house was gathered together , and they were all circumcised . Abraham circumcised them that day , just as God had told him to do .
ERV	Genesis	17	24	Abraham was
ERV	Genesis	17	25	And Ishmael , his son , was
ERV	Genesis	17	26	Abraham and his son were circumcised on the same day .
ERV	Genesis	17	27	Also , on that day all the men in Abraham ’ s house were circumcised . All the slaves born in his house and all the slaves he had bought were circumcised .

ERV	Genesis	18	18	Abraham will become a great and powerful nation , and all the nations on earth will be blessed because of him .
ERV	Genesis	18	2	He looked up and saw three men standing in front of him . When he saw the men , he ran to them and bowed before them .
ERV	Genesis	18	3	Abraham said , “ Sirs , [ a ] please stay a while with me , your servant .
ERV	Genesis	18	4	I will bring some water to wash your feet . You can rest under the trees .
ERV	Genesis	18	5	I will get some food for you , and you can eat as much as you want . Then you can continue your journey. ” The three men said , “ Do as you wish. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	6	Abraham hurried to the tent . He said to Sarah , “ Quickly , prepare enough flour for three loaves of bread. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	7	Then Abraham ran to his cattle . He took his best young calf and gave it to the servant there . He told the servant to quickly kill the calf and prepare it for food .
ERV	Genesis	18	8	Abraham brought the meat and some milk and cheese and set them down in front of the three men . Then he stood near the men , ready to serve them while they sat under the tree and ate .
ERV	Genesis	18	9	Then the men said to Abraham , “ Where is your wife Sarah ? ” Abraham said , “ She is there , in the tent. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	10	Then one of them said , “ I will come again in the spring . At that time your wife Sarah will have a son. ” Sarah was listening in the tent and heard these things .
ERV	Genesis	18	11	Abraham and Sarah were very old . Sarah was past the right age for women to have children .
ERV	Genesis	18	12	So she laughed to herself and said , “ I am old , and my husband is old . I am too old to have a baby. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	13	Then the Lord said to Abraham , “ Sarah laughed and said she was too old to have a baby .
ERV	Genesis	18	14	But is anything too hard for the Lord ? I will come again in the spring , just as I said I would , and your wife Sarah will have a son. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	15	Sarah said , “ I didn ’ t laugh ! ” ( She said this because she was afraid . ) Then the Lord said , “ No , I know that is not true . You did laugh ! ”
ERV	Genesis	18	16	Then the men got up to leave . They looked toward Sodom and began walking in that direction . Abraham walked with them to send them on their way . Abraham ’ s Bargain With God
ERV	Genesis	18	17	The Lord said to himself , “ Should I tell Abraham what I am going to do now ?
ERV	Genesis	18	19	I have made a special agreement with him . I did this so that he would command his children and his descendants to live the way the Lord wants them to . I did this so that they would live right and be fair . Then I , the Lord , can give him what I promised. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	20	Then the Lord said , “ I have heard many times that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah are very evil .
ERV	Genesis	18	21	I will go and see if they are as bad as I have heard . Then I will know for sure. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	22	So the men turned and started walking toward Sodom while Abraham stood there before the Lord .
ERV	Genesis	18	23	Then Abraham approached him and asked , “ Will you destroy the good people while you are destroying those who are evil ?
ERV	Genesis	18	24	What if there are fifty good people in that city ? Will you still destroy it ? Surely you will save the city for the fifty good people living there .
ERV	Genesis	18	25	Surely you would not destroy the city . You would not destroy fifty good people to kill those who are evil . If that happened , those who are good would be the same as those who are evil—both would be punished . As the judge of the whole world , surely you would do the right thing ! ”
ERV	Genesis	18	26	Then the Lord said , “ If I find fifty good people in the city of Sodom , I will save the whole city. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	27	Then Abraham said , “ Compared to you , Lord , I am only dust and ashes . But let me bother you again and ask you this question .
ERV	Genesis	18	28	What if there are five less than fifty ? Will you destroy a whole city because of just five people ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find forty-five good people there , I will not destroy the city. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	29	Abraham spoke again . He said , “ And if you find only forty good people there , will you destroy the city ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find forty good people , I will not destroy the city. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	30	Then Abraham said , “ Lord , please don ’ t be angry with me , but let me ask you this . If only thirty good people are in the city , will you destroy it ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find thirty good people there , I will not destroy the city. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	31	Then Abraham said , “ Lord , may I bother you again and ask , what if there are twenty good people ? ” The Lord answered , “ If I find twenty good people , I will not destroy the city. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	32	Then Abraham said , “ Lord , please don ’ t be angry with me , but let me bother you this one last time . If you find ten good people there , what will you do ? ” The Lord said , “ If I find ten good people in the city , I will not destroy it. ”
ERV	Genesis	18	33	The Lord finished speaking to Abraham and left . Then Abraham went back home . Footnotes - Genesis 18:3 Sirs This Hebrew word can mean “ sirs ” or “ Lord. ” This might show that these were not ordinary men .
ERV	Genesis	19	19	You have been very kind to me , your servant . You have been very kind to save me , but I can not run all the way to the mountains . What if I am too slow and something happens ? I will be killed !
ERV	Genesis	19	3	But Lot continued to ask them to come to his house , so they agreed and went with him . Lot gave them something to drink . He baked some bread for them , and they ate it .
ERV	Genesis	19	4	That evening , just before bedtime , men from every part of town came to Lot ’ s house . They stood around the house and called to Lot . They said ,
ERV	Genesis	19	5	“ Where are the two men who came to you tonight ? Bring them out to us . We want to have sex with them. ”
ERV	Genesis	19	6	Lot went outside and closed the door behind him .
ERV	Genesis	19	7	He said to the men , “ No , my friends , I beg you , please don ’ t do this evil thing !
ERV	Genesis	19	8	Look , I have two daughters who have never slept with a man before . I will give my daughters to you . You can do anything you want with them . But please don ’ t do anything to these men . They have come to my house , and I must protect them. ” [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	19	9	The men surrounding the house answered , “ Get out of our way ! ” They said to themselves , “ This man Lot came to our city as a visitor . Now he wants to tell us how we should live ! ” Then the men said to Lot , “ We will do worse things to you than to them. ” So the men started moving closer and closer to Lot . They were about to break down the door .
ERV	Genesis	19	10	But the two men staying with Lot opened the door , pulled him back inside the house , and closed the door .
ERV	Genesis	19	11	Then they did something to the men outside the door—they caused all these evil men , young and old , to become blind . So the men trying to get in the house could not find the door . The Escape From Sodom
ERV	Genesis	19	12	The two men said to Lot , “ Are there any other people from your family living in this city ? Do you have any sons-in-law , sons , daughters , or any other people from your family here ? If so , you should tell them to leave now .
ERV	Genesis	19	13	We are going to destroy this city . The Lord heard how evil this city is , so he sent us to destroy it. ”
ERV	Genesis	19	14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law , the men who had married his other daughters . He said , “ Hurry and leave this city ! The Lord will soon destroy it ! ” But they thought he was joking .
ERV	Genesis	19	15	The next morning at dawn , the angels were trying to make Lot hurry . They said , “ This city will be punished , so take your wife and your two daughters who are still with you and leave this place . Then you will not be destroyed with the city. ”
ERV	Genesis	19	16	When Lot did not move fast enough , the two men grabbed his hand . They also took the hands of his wife and his two daughters . The two men led Lot and his family safely out of the city . The Lord was kind to Lot and his family .
ERV	Genesis	19	17	So after the two men brought Lot and his family out of the city , one of the men said , “ Now run to save your life ! Don ’ t look back at the city , and don ’ t stop anywhere in the valley . Run until you are in the mountains . If you stop , you will be destroyed with the city ! ”
ERV	Genesis	19	18	But Lot said to the two men , “ Sirs , please don ’ t force me to run so far !
ERV	Genesis	19	20	Look , there is a very small town near here . Let me run to that town . I can run there and be safe. ”
ERV	Genesis	19	21	The angel said to Lot , “ Very well , I ’ ll let you do that . I will not destroy that town .
ERV	Genesis	19	22	But run there quickly . I can not destroy Sodom until you are safely in that town. ” ( That town is named Zoar , [ b ] because it is a small town . ) Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed
ERV	Genesis	19	23	Lot was entering the town as the sun came up ,
ERV	Genesis	19	24	and the Lord began to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah . He caused fire and burning sulfur to fall from the sky .
ERV	Genesis	19	25	He destroyed the whole valley—all the cities , the people living in the cities , and all the plants in the valley .
ERV	Genesis	19	26	Lot ’ s wife was following behind him and looked back at the city . When she did , she became a block of salt .
ERV	Genesis	19	27	Early the next morning , Abraham got up and went to the place where he stood before the Lord .
ERV	Genesis	19	28	Abraham looked down into the valley toward the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah . He saw clouds of smoke rising from the land , like smoke from a furnace .
ERV	Genesis	19	29	God destroyed the cities in the valley , but he remembered what Abraham had said . So God sent Lot away from those cities before destroying them . Lot and His Daughters
ERV	Genesis	19	30	Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar , so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave .
ERV	Genesis	19	31	One day the older daughter said to the younger , “ Everywhere on the earth , men and women marry and have a family . But our father is old , and there are no men around here to give us children .
ERV	Genesis	19	32	So let ’ s get our father drunk with wine . Then we can have sex with him . That way we can use our father to keep our family alive ! ”
ERV	Genesis	19	33	That night the two girls went to their father and got him drunk with wine . Then the older daughter went and had sexual relations with him . He did not even know when she came to bed or when she got up .
ERV	Genesis	19	34	The next day the older daughter said to the younger daughter , “ Last night I went to bed with my father . Let ’ s get him drunk with wine again tonight . Then you can go and have sex with him . In this way we can use our father to have children , and our family will not come to an end. ”
ERV	Genesis	19	35	So that night the two girls got their father drunk with wine . Then the younger daughter went and had sexual relations with him . Again , Lot did not know when she came to bed or when she got up .
ERV	Genesis	19	36	Both of Lot ’ s daughters became pregnant . Their father was the father of their babies .
ERV	Genesis	19	37	The older daughter gave birth to a son . She named him Moab . [ c ] Moab is the ancestor of all the Moabites living today .
ERV	Genesis	19	38	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son . She named him Ben-Ammi . [ d ] Ben-Ammi is the ancestor of all the Ammonites living today . Footnotes - Genesis 19:8 I must protect them Whoever invited a traveler in as a guest was also promising to protect the traveler . - Genesis 19:22 Zoar This name means “ small. ” - Genesis 19:37 Moab In Hebrew this name sounds like “ from father. ” - Genesis 19:38 Ben-Ammi In Hebrew this name sounds like “ son of my father ” or “ son of my people . ”
ERV	Genesis	20	20	Abraham left that place and traveled to the Negev . He settled in the city of Gerar , between Kadesh and Shur . While in Gerar ,
ERV	Genesis	20	2	Abraham told people that Sarah was his sister . King Abimelech of Gerar heard this . Abimelech wanted Sarah , so he sent some servants to take her .
ERV	Genesis	20	3	But one night God spoke to Abimelech in a dream and said , “ You will die . The woman you took is married. ”
ERV	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelech had not yet slept with Sarah , so he said , “ Lord , I am not guilty . Would you kill an innocent man ?
ERV	Genesis	20	5	Abraham himself told me , ‘ This woman is my sister , ’ and she also said , ‘ This man is my brother. ’ I am innocent . I did not know what I was doing. ”
ERV	Genesis	20	6	Then God said to Abimelech in a dream , “ Yes , I know that you are innocent and that you did not know what you were doing . I saved you . I did not allow you to sin against me . I was the one who did not allow you to sleep with her .
ERV	Genesis	20	7	So give Abraham his wife again . He is a prophet . He will pray for you , and you will live . But if you don ’ t give Sarah back to him , I promise that you will die . And all your family will die with you. ”
ERV	Genesis	20	8	So very early the next morning , Abimelech called all his servants and told them about the dream . The servants were very afraid .
ERV	Genesis	20	9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him , “ Why have you done this to us ? What wrong did I do to you ? Why did you lie and say that she was your sister ? You brought great trouble to my kingdom . You should not have done this to me .
ERV	Genesis	20	10	What were you afraid of ? Why did you do this to me ? ”
ERV	Genesis	20	11	Then Abraham said , “ I thought no one in this place respected God . I thought someone would kill me to get Sarah .
ERV	Genesis	20	12	She is my wife , but she is also my sister . She is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother .
ERV	Genesis	20	13	God led me away from my father ’ s house . He led me to wander to many different places . When that happened , I told Sarah , ‘ Do something for me . Wherever we go , tell people you are my sister. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	20	14	So Abimelech gave Sarah back to Abraham . Abimelech also gave Abraham some sheep , cattle , and slaves .
ERV	Genesis	20	15	And Abimelech said , “ Look all around you . This is my land . You may live any place you want. ”
ERV	Genesis	20	16	Abimelech said to Sarah , “ I gave your brother Abraham
ERV	Genesis	20	1000	pieces of silver . I did this to show that I am very sorry . I want everyone to see that I did the right thing. ” 17-18 The Lord made all the women in Abimelech ’ s family not able to have children . God did this because Abimelech had taken Sarah , Abraham ’ s wife . But Abraham prayed to God , and God healed Abimelech , his wife , and his servant girls .
ERV	Genesis	21	21	His mother found a wife for him in Egypt . They continued to live in the Paran desert . Abraham ’ s Bargain With Abimelech
ERV	Genesis	21	2	At exactly the time God said it would happen , Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age .
ERV	Genesis	21	3	Abraham named his son Isaac . [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	21	4	Abraham did what God commanded and circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old .
ERV	Genesis	21	5	Abraham was
ERV	Genesis	21	100	years old when his son Isaac was born .
ERV	Genesis	21	6	Sarah said , “ God has made me happy , and everyone who hears about this will be happy with me .
ERV	Genesis	21	7	No one thought that I , Sarah , would be able to have Abraham ’ s child . But I have given Abraham a son , even though he is old. ” Trouble at Home
ERV	Genesis	21	8	Isaac continued to grow , and soon he was old enough to begin eating solid food . So Abraham gave a big party .
ERV	Genesis	21	9	Sarah saw Hagar ’ s son playing . ( Hagar was the Egyptian slave woman who gave birth to Abraham ’ s first son . )
ERV	Genesis	21	10	Sarah said to Abraham , “ Get rid of that slave woman and her son . Send them away ! When we die , our son Isaac will get everything we have . I don ’ t want that slave woman ’ s son sharing these things with my son Isaac ! ”
ERV	Genesis	21	11	This upset Abraham very much . He was worried about his son Ishmael .
ERV	Genesis	21	12	But God said to Abraham , “ Don ’ t worry about the boy and the slave woman . Do what Sarah wants . Your descendants will be those who come through Isaac .
ERV	Genesis	21	13	But I will also bless the son of your slave woman . He is your son , so I will make a great nation from his family also. ”
ERV	Genesis	21	14	Early the next morning Abraham took some food and water and gave them to Hagar . She carried them and left with her boy . She left that place and wandered in the desert of Beersheba .
ERV	Genesis	21	15	After some time , when all their drinking water was gone , Hagar put her son under a bush .
ERV	Genesis	21	16	Then she walked a short distance away and sat down . She thought her son would die because there was no water . She did not want to watch him die . She sat there and began to cry .
ERV	Genesis	21	17	God heard the boy crying , and God ’ s angel called to Hagar from heaven . He said , “ What is wrong , Hagar ? Don ’ t be afraid ! God has heard the boy crying there .
ERV	Genesis	21	18	Go help the boy . Hold his hand and lead him . I will make him the father of many people. ”
ERV	Genesis	21	19	Then God allowed Hagar to see a well of water . So she went to the well and filled her bag with water . Then she gave water to the boy to drink .
ERV	Genesis	21	20	God continued to be with the boy while he grew up . Ishmael lived in the desert and became a hunter . He learned to shoot a bow very well .
ERV	Genesis	21	22	Then Abimelech and Phicol spoke with Abraham . Phicol was the commander of Abimelech ’ s army . They said to Abraham , “ God is with you in everything you do .
ERV	Genesis	21	23	So make a promise to me here before God . Promise that you will be fair with me and with my children . Promise that you will be kind to me and this country where you have lived . Promise that you will be as kind to me as I have been to you. ”
ERV	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said , “ I promise to treat you the same way you have treated me. ”
ERV	Genesis	21	25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech because Abimelech ’ s servants had captured a well of water .
ERV	Genesis	21	26	But Abimelech said , “ I don ’ t know who did this . You never told me about this before today ! ”
ERV	Genesis	21	27	So Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement . Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle as proof of the agreement .
ERV	Genesis	21	28	Abraham also put seven [ b ] female lambs in front of Abimelech .
ERV	Genesis	21	29	Abimelech asked Abraham , “ Why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves ? ”
ERV	Genesis	21	30	Abraham answered , “ When you accept these lambs from me , it will be proof that I dug this well. ”
ERV	Genesis	21	31	So after that , the well was called Beersheba . [ c ] Abraham gave the well this name because it was the place where they made a promise to each other .
ERV	Genesis	21	32	So Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement at Beersheba . Then Abimelech and Phicol , his military commander , went back to the country of the Philistines .
ERV	Genesis	21	33	Abraham planted a special tree at Beersheba and prayed to the Lord , the God who lives forever .

ERV	Genesis	22	4	After they traveled three days , Abraham looked up , and in the distance he saw the place where they were going .
ERV	Genesis	22	5	Then he said to his servants , “ Stay here with the donkey . The boy and I will go to that place and worship . Then we will come back to you later. ”
ERV	Genesis	22	6	Abraham took the wood for the sacrifice and put it on his son ’ s shoulder . Abraham took the special knife and fire . Then both he and his son went together to the place for worship .
ERV	Genesis	22	7	Isaac said to his father Abraham , “ Father ! ” Abraham answered , “ Yes , son ? ” Isaac said , “ I see the wood and the fire . But where is the lamb we will burn as a sacrifice ? ”
ERV	Genesis	22	8	Abraham answered , “ God himself is providing the lamb for the sacrifice , my son. ” So both Abraham and his son went together to that place .

ERV	Genesis	22	12	The angel said , “ Don ’ t kill your son or hurt him in any way . Now I can see that you do respect and obey God . I see that you are ready to kill your son , your only son , for me. ”
ERV	Genesis	22	13	Then Abraham noticed a ram whose horns were caught in a bush . So Abraham went and took the ram . He offered it , instead of his son , as a sacrifice to God .
ERV	Genesis	22	14	So Abraham gave that place a name , “ The Lord Provides. ” [ a ] Even today people say , “ On the mountain of the Lord , he will give us what we need. ” [ b ]
ERV	Genesis	22	15	The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time .

ERV	Genesis	23	3	Then he left his dead wife and went to talk to the Hittites . He said ,
ERV	Genesis	23	4	“ I am only a foreigner staying in your country . I have no place to bury my wife . Please give me some land so that I can bury her. ”
ERV	Genesis	23	5	The Hittites answered Abraham ,
ERV	Genesis	23	6	“ Sir , you are a great leader [ a ] among us . You can have the best place we have to bury your dead . You can have any of our burying places that you want . None of us will stop you from burying your wife there. ”
ERV	Genesis	23	7	Abraham got up and bowed to the people .
ERV	Genesis	23	8	He said to them , “ If you really want to help me bury my dead wife , speak to Ephron the son of Zohar for me .
ERV	Genesis	23	9	I would like to buy the cave of Machpelah , which belongs to Ephron . It is at the end of his field . I will pay him the full price . I want all of you to be witnesses that I am buying it as a burial place. ”
ERV	Genesis	23	10	Ephron was sitting there among the people . He answered Abraham ,
ERV	Genesis	23	11	“ No , sir . Here in front of my people , I give you that land and the cave on it so that you can bury your wife. ”
ERV	Genesis	23	12	Abraham bowed before the Hittites .
ERV	Genesis	23	13	He said to Ephron before all the people , “ But I want to give you the full price for the field . Accept my money , and I will bury my dead. ”
ERV	Genesis	23	14	Ephron answered Abraham ,

ERV	Genesis	24	8	If the girl refuses to come with you , you will be free from this promise . But you must not take my son back to that place. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	9	So the servant put his hand under his master ’ s leg and made the promise . The Search Begins
ERV	Genesis	24	10	The servant took ten of Abraham ’ s camels and left that place . The servant carried with him many different kinds of beautiful gifts . He went to Mesopotamia , to Nahor ’ s city .
ERV	Genesis	24	11	In the evening , when the women come out to get water , he went to the water well outside the city . He made the camels kneel down at the well .
ERV	Genesis	24	12	The servant said , “ Lord , you are the God of my master Abraham . Please show your kindness to my master by helping me find a wife for his son Isaac .
ERV	Genesis	24	13	Here I am , standing by this well of water , and the young women from the city are coming out to get water .

If she says , ‘ Drink , and I will also give water to your camels , ’ I will know that she is the right one . It will be proof that you have shown kindness to my master. ” A Wife Is Found
ERV	Genesis	24	15	Before the servant finished praying , a young woman named Rebekah came to the well . She was the daughter of Bethuel . ( Bethuel was the son of Milcah and Nahor , Abraham ’ s brother . ) Rebekah came to the well with her water jar on her shoulder .
ERV	Genesis	24	16	She was very pretty . She was a virgin ; no man had ever had sexual relations with her . She went down to the well and filled her jar .
ERV	Genesis	24	17	Then the servant ran to her and said , “ Please give me a little water to drink from your jar. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	18	Rebekah quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and gave him a drink . She said , “ Drink this , sir. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	19	As soon as she finished giving him something to drink , Rebekah said , “ I will also pour some water for your camels. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	20	So Rebekah quickly poured all the water from her jar into the drinking trough for the camels . Then she ran to the well to get more water , and she gave water to all the camels .
ERV	Genesis	24	21	The servant quietly watched her . He wanted to be sure that the Lord had given him an answer and had made his trip successful .
ERV	Genesis	24	22	After the camels finished drinking , he gave Rebekah a gold ring that weighed 1/4 ounce . [ b ] He also gave her two gold arm bracelets that weighed
ERV	Genesis	24	23	The servant asked , “ Who is your father ? And is there a place in your father ’ s house for me and my men to sleep ? ”
ERV	Genesis	24	25	Then she said , “ Yes , we have straw and other food for your camels and a place for you to sleep. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	26	The servant bowed and worshiped the Lord .
ERV	Genesis	24	27	He said , “ Praise be to the Lord , the God of my master Abraham . The Lord has been kind and loyal to him by leading me to his own people. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	28	Then Rebekah ran and told her family about all these things . 29-30 She had a brother named Laban . She told him what the man had said to her . Laban was listening to her . And when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister ’ s arms , he ran out to the well . There the man was , standing by the camels at the well .
ERV	Genesis	24	31	Laban said , “ Sir , you are welcome to come in ! [ d ] You don ’ t have to stand outside here . I have prepared a room for you to sleep in and a place for your camels. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	32	So Abraham ’ s servant went into the house . Laban unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed . Then he gave Abraham ’ s servant water so that he and the men with him could wash their feet .
ERV	Genesis	24	33	Laban then gave him food to eat , but the servant refused to eat . He said , “ I will not eat until I have told you why I came. ” So Laban said , “ Then tell us. ” Bargaining for Rebekah
ERV	Genesis	24	34	The servant said , “ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
ERV	Genesis	24	35	The Lord has greatly blessed my master in everything . My master has become a great man . The Lord has given him many flocks of sheep and herds of cattle . He has much silver and gold and many servants . He has many camels and donkeys .
ERV	Genesis	24	36	Sarah was my master ’ s wife . When she was very old , she gave birth to a son , and my master has given everything he owns to that son .
ERV	Genesis	24	37	My master forced me to make a promise to him . He said to me , ‘ You must not allow my son to marry a girl from Canaan . We live among these people , but I don ’ t want him to marry one of the Canaanite girls .
ERV	Genesis	24	38	So you must promise to go to my father ’ s country . Go to my family and choose a wife for my son. ’
ERV	Genesis	24	39	I said to my master , ‘ Maybe the woman will not come back to this place with me. ’
ERV	Genesis	24	40	But my master said to me , ‘ I serve the Lord , and he will send his angel with you and help you . You will find a wife for my son among my people there .
ERV	Genesis	24	41	But if you go to my father ’ s country , and they refuse to give you a wife for my son , you will be free from this promise. ’
ERV	Genesis	24	42	“ Today I came to this well and said , ‘ Lord , God of my master Abraham , please make my trip successful .
ERV	Genesis	24	43	I will stand by this well and wait for a young woman to come to get water . Then I will say , “ Please give me water from your jar to drink. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	44	The right woman will answer in a special way . She will say , “ Drink this water , and I will also get water for your camels. ” That way I will know that she is the one the Lord has chosen for my master ’ s son. ’
ERV	Genesis	24	45	“ Before I finished praying , Rebekah came out to the well to get water . She had her water jar on her shoulder as she went to get water from the well . I asked her to give me some water .
ERV	Genesis	24	46	She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and poured me some water . Then she said , ‘ Drink this , and I ’ ll get some water for your camels. ’ So I drank the water , and she gave water to my camels .
ERV	Genesis	24	47	Then I asked her , ‘ Who is your father ? ’ She answered , ‘ My father is Bethuel the son of Milcah and Nahor. ’ Then I gave her the ring and bracelets for her arms .
ERV	Genesis	24	48	I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord . I praised the Lord , the God of my master Abraham . I thanked him for leading me straight to the granddaughter of my master ’ s brother .
ERV	Genesis	24	49	Now , tell me , will you be kind and loyal to my master and give him your daughter ? Or will you refuse to give her to him ? Tell me so that I will know what I should do. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered , “ We see that this is from the Lord , so there is nothing we can say to change it .
ERV	Genesis	24	51	Here is Rebekah . Take her and go . Let her marry your master ’ s son . This is what the Lord wants. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	52	When Abraham ’ s servant heard this , he bowed to the ground before the Lord .
ERV	Genesis	24	53	Then he gave Rebekah the gifts he brought . He gave her beautiful clothes and gold and silver jewelry . He also gave expensive gifts to her mother and brother .
ERV	Genesis	24	54	Then he and his men had something to eat and drink , and they spent the night there . Early the next morning they got up and the servant said , “ Now we must go back to my master. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	55	Rebekah ’ s mother and her brother said , “ Let Rebekah stay with us for a short time . Let her stay with us ten days . After that she can go. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	56	But the servant said to them , “ Don ’ t make me wait . The Lord has made my trip successful . Now let me go back to my master. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	57	Rebekah ’ s brother and mother said , “ We will call Rebekah and ask her what she wants to do. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	58	They called her and asked her , “ Do you want to go with this man now ? ” Rebekah said , “ Yes , I will go. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	59	So they allowed Rebekah to go with Abraham ’ s servant and his men . Her nurse also went with them .
ERV	Genesis	24	60	While Rebekah was leaving they said to her , “ Our sister , may you be the mother of millions of people , and may your descendants defeat their enemies and take their cities. ”
ERV	Genesis	24	61	Then Rebekah and her nurse got on the camels and followed the servant and his men . So the servant took Rebekah and left .
ERV	Genesis	24	62	Isaac had left Beer Lahai Roi and was now living in the Negev .
ERV	Genesis	24	63	One evening he went out to the field to think . [ e ] He looked up and saw the camels coming from far away .
ERV	Genesis	24	64	Rebekah also looked and saw Isaac . Then she jumped down from the camel .
ERV	Genesis	24	65	She said to the servant , “ Who is that young man walking in the field to meet us ? ” The servant said , “ That is my master ’ s son. ” So Rebekah covered her face with her veil .
ERV	Genesis	24	66	The servant told Isaac everything that had happened .
ERV	Genesis	24	67	Then Isaac brought the girl into his mother ’ s tent . Rebekah became his wife that day . Isaac loved her very much . So he was comforted after his mother ’ s death .

ERV	Genesis	25	8	Then he grew weak and died . He had lived a long and satisfying life . He died and went to be with his people .
ERV	Genesis	25	9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah . This cave is in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar . It was east of Mamre .

ERV	Genesis	25	11	After Abraham died , God blessed Isaac . Isaac was living at Beer Lahai Roi .

ERV	Genesis	25	19	This is the story of Isaac . Abraham had a son named Isaac .
ERV	Genesis	25	20	When Isaac was
ERV	Genesis	25	40	years old , he married Rebekah . Rebekah was from Paddan Aram . She was Bethuel ’ s daughter and the sister of Laban the Aramean .
ERV	Genesis	25	21	Isaac ’ s wife could not have children . So Isaac prayed to the Lord for her . The Lord heard Isaac ’ s prayer , and he allowed Rebekah to become pregnant .
ERV	Genesis	25	22	While Rebekah was pregnant , the babies inside her struggled with one another . She prayed to the Lord and said , “ What is happening to me ? ”
ERV	Genesis	25	23	The Lord said to her , “ The leaders of two nations are in your body . Two nations will come from you , and they will be divided . One of them will be stronger , and the older will serve the younger. ”
ERV	Genesis	25	24	When the right time came , Rebekah gave birth to twins .
ERV	Genesis	25	26	When the second baby was born , he was holding tightly to Esau ’ s heel . So that baby was named Jacob . [ e ] Isaac was
ERV	Genesis	25	60	years old when Jacob and Esau were born .
ERV	Genesis	25	27	The boys grew up . Esau became a skilled hunter , who loved to be out in the fields . But Jacob was a quiet man , who stayed at home .

ERV	Genesis	25	29	One day Esau came back from hunting . He was tired and weak from hunger . Jacob was boiling a pot of beans .
ERV	Genesis	25	30	So Esau said to Jacob , “ I am weak with hunger . Let me have some of that red soup. ” ( That is why people call him “ Red. ” [ f ] )
ERV	Genesis	25	31	But Jacob said , “ You must sell me your rights as the firstborn son. ”
ERV	Genesis	25	32	Esau said , “ I am almost dead with hunger , so what good are these rights to me now ? ”
ERV	Genesis	25	33	But Jacob said , “ First , promise me that you will give them to me. ” So Esau made an oath to him and sold his rights as the firstborn son to Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil [ g ] soup . Esau ate the food , had something to drink , and then left . So Esau showed that he did not care about his rights as the firstborn son .

ERV	Genesis	26	2	The Lord spoke to Isaac and said , “ Don ’ t go down to Egypt . Live in the land that I commanded you to live in .
ERV	Genesis	26	3	Stay in this land , and I will be with you . I will bless you . I will give you and your family all these lands . I will do what I promised to Abraham your father .
ERV	Genesis	26	4	I will make your family as many as the stars of heaven , and I will give all these lands to your family . Through your descendants [ a ] every nation on earth will be blessed .
ERV	Genesis	26	5	I will do this because your father Abraham obeyed my words and did what I said . He obeyed my commands , my laws , and my rules. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac settled in Gerar .
ERV	Genesis	26	7	His wife Rebekah was very beautiful . The men of that place asked Isaac about Rebekah . He said , “ She is my sister. ” He was afraid to tell them Rebekah was his wife . He was afraid the men would kill him so that they could have her .
ERV	Genesis	26	8	After Isaac had lived there a long time , Abimelech looked out of his window and saw Isaac and his wife enjoying one another .
ERV	Genesis	26	9	Abimelech called for Isaac and said , “ This woman is your wife . Why did you tell us that she was your sister ? ” Isaac said to him , “ I was afraid that you would kill me so that you could have her. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	10	Abimelech said , “ You have done a bad thing to us . One of our men might have had sex with your wife . Then he would be guilty of a great sin. ”

ERV	Genesis	26	12	Isaac planted fields in that place , and that year he gathered a great harvest . The Lord blessed him very much .
ERV	Genesis	26	13	Isaac became rich . He gathered more and more wealth until he became a very rich man .
ERV	Genesis	26	14	He had many flocks and herds of animals . He also had many slaves . All the Philistines were jealous of him .
ERV	Genesis	26	15	So they destroyed all the wells that Isaac ’ s father Abraham and his servants had dug many years before . They filled them with sand .
ERV	Genesis	26	16	Abimelech said to Isaac , “ Leave our country . You have become much more powerful than we are. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac left that place and camped near the little river of Gerar . He stayed there and lived .
ERV	Genesis	26	18	Long before this time , Abraham had dug many wells . After he died , the Philistines filled the wells with sand . So Isaac went back and dug those wells again . He gave them the same names his father had given them .
ERV	Genesis	26	19	Isaac ’ s servants also dug a well near the little river and found fresh water . [ b ]
ERV	Genesis	26	20	But the men who herded sheep in the Valley of Gerar argued with Isaac ’ s servants . They said , “ This water is ours. ” So Isaac named that well Esek . [ c ] He gave it that name because it was the place where they had argued with him .
ERV	Genesis	26	21	Then Isaac ’ s servants dug another well . But there was an argument over this well too . So Isaac named that well Sitnah . [ d ]
ERV	Genesis	26	22	Isaac moved from there and dug another well . No one came to argue about this well . So Isaac named it Rehoboth . [ e ] He said , “ Now the Lord has found a place for us . We will grow and be successful in this place. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	23	From there Isaac went to Beersheba .
ERV	Genesis	26	24	The Lord spoke to him that night and said , “ I am the God of your father Abraham . Don ’ t be afraid . I am with you , and I will bless you . I will make your family great . I will do this because of my servant Abraham. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	25	So Isaac built an altar and worshiped the Lord in that place . He set up camp there , and his servants dug a well .
ERV	Genesis	26	27	Isaac asked , “ Why have you come to see me ? You were not friendly to me before . You even forced me to leave your country. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	28	They answered , “ Now we know that the Lord is with you . We think that we should make an agreement . We want you to make a promise to us .
ERV	Genesis	26	29	We did not hurt you ; now you should promise not to hurt us . We sent you away , but we sent you away in peace . Now it is clear that the Lord has blessed you. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	30	So Isaac gave a party for them . They all ate and drank .
ERV	Genesis	26	31	Early the next morning each man made a promise and a vow . Then the men left in peace .
ERV	Genesis	26	32	On that day Isaac ’ s servants came and told him about the well they had dug . The servants said , “ We found water in that well. ”
ERV	Genesis	26	33	So Isaac named it Shibah . [ f ] And that city is still called Beersheba . [ g ] Esau ’ s Wives
ERV	Genesis	26	34	When Esau was
ERV	Genesis	26	40	years old , he married two Hittite women . One was Judith the daughter of Beeri . The other was Basemath the daughter of Elon .

ERV	Genesis	27	27	So Jacob went to his father and kissed him . When Isaac smelled Esau ’ s clothes , he blessed him and said , “ My son smells like the fields the Lord has blessed .
ERV	Genesis	27	2	Isaac said , “ I am old . Maybe I will die soon .
ERV	Genesis	27	3	So take your bow and arrows and go hunting . Kill an animal for me to eat .
ERV	Genesis	27	4	Prepare the food that I love . Bring it to me , and I will eat it . Then I will bless you before I die. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	5	So Esau went hunting . Rebekah was listening when Isaac told this to his son Esau .
ERV	Genesis	27	6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob , “ Listen , I heard your father talking to your brother Esau .
ERV	Genesis	27	7	Your father said , ‘ Kill an animal for me to eat . Prepare the food for me , and I will eat it . Then , with the Lord as witness , I will bless you before I die. ’
ERV	Genesis	27	8	So listen , son , and do what I tell you .
ERV	Genesis	27	9	Go out to our goats and bring me two young ones . I will prepare them the way your father loves them .
ERV	Genesis	27	10	Then you will carry the food to your father , and he will bless you before he dies. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	11	But Jacob told his mother Rebekah , “ My brother Esau is a hairy man . I am not hairy like him .
ERV	Genesis	27	12	If my father touches me , he will know that I am not Esau . Then he will not bless me—he will curse me because I tried to trick him. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	13	So Rebekah said to him , “ I will accept the blame if there is trouble . Do what I said . Go get the goats for me. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	14	So Jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother . His mother cooked the goats in the special way that Isaac loved .
ERV	Genesis	27	15	Then Rebekah took the clothes that her older son Esau loved to wear . She put these clothes on the younger son Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	27	16	She took the skins of the goats and put them on Jacob ’ s hands and on his neck .
ERV	Genesis	27	17	Then she got the food she had cooked and gave it to Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	27	18	Jacob went to his father and said , “ Father. ” His father answered , “ Yes , son . Who are you ? ”
ERV	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to his father , “ I am Esau , your first son . I have done what you told me . Now sit up and eat the meat from the animals that I hunted for you . Then you can bless me. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	20	But Isaac said to his son , “ How have you hunted and killed the animals so quickly ? ” Jacob answered , “ Because the Lord your God allowed me to find the animals quickly. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Come near to me so that I can feel you , my son . If I can feel you , I will know if you are really my son Esau. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	22	So Jacob went to Isaac his father . Isaac felt him and said , “ Your voice sounds like Jacob ’ s voice , but your arms are hairy like the arms of Esau. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	23	Isaac did not know it was Jacob , because his arms were hairy like Esau ’ s . So Isaac blessed Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	27	24	Isaac said , “ Are you really my son Esau ? ” Jacob answered , “ Yes , I am. ” The Blessing for Jacob
ERV	Genesis	27	25	Then Isaac said , “ Bring me the food . I will eat it and bless you. ” So Jacob gave him the food , and he ate it . Then Jacob gave him some wine , and he drank it .
ERV	Genesis	27	26	Then Isaac said to him . “ Son , come near and kiss me. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	28	May God give you plenty of rain , good crops , and wine .
ERV	Genesis	27	29	May the nations serve you and many people bow down to you . You will rule over your brothers . Your mother ’ s sons will bow down to you and obey you . Whoever curses you will be cursed . Whoever blesses you will be blessed. ” Esau ’ s “ Blessing ”
ERV	Genesis	27	30	Isaac finished blessing Jacob . Then , just as Jacob left his father Isaac , Esau came in from hunting .
ERV	Genesis	27	31	Esau prepared the food in the special way his father loved . He brought it to his father and said , “ Father , I am your son . Get up and eat the meat from the animals that I killed for you . Then you can bless me. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	32	But Isaac said to him , “ Who are you ? ” He answered , “ I am your son—your first son—Esau. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	33	Then Isaac became so upset that he began to shake . He said , “ Then who was it that cooked and brought me food before you came ? I ate it all , and I blessed him . Now it is too late to take back my blessing. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard his father ’ s words , he became very angry and bitter . He cried out and said to his father , “ Then bless me also , father ! ”
ERV	Genesis	27	35	Isaac said , “ Your brother tricked me ! He came and took your blessing ! ”
ERV	Genesis	27	36	Esau said , “ His name is Jacob . [ a ] That is the right name for him . He has tricked me twice . He took away my rights as the firstborn son . And now he has taken away my blessing. ” Then Esau said , “ Have you saved any blessing for me ? ”
ERV	Genesis	27	37	Isaac answered , “ I have already given Jacob the power to rule over you . And I said all his brothers would be his servants . I have given him the blessing for much grain and wine . There is nothing left to give you , my son. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	38	But Esau continued to beg his father . “ Do you have only one blessing , father ? Bless me also , father ! ” Esau began to cry .
ERV	Genesis	27	39	Then Isaac said to him , “ You will not live on good land . You will not have much rain .
ERV	Genesis	27	40	You will have to fight to live , and you will be a slave to your brother . But when you fight to be free , you will break away from his control. ” Jacob Leaves the Country
ERV	Genesis	27	41	After that Esau hated Jacob because of this blessing . Esau said to himself , “ My father will soon die , and after we are finished with that , I will kill Jacob. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	42	Rebekah heard about Esau ’ s plan to kill Jacob . She sent for Jacob and said to him , “ Listen , your brother Esau is planning to kill you .
ERV	Genesis	27	43	So , son , do what I say . My brother Laban is living in Haran . Go to him and hide .
ERV	Genesis	27	44	Stay with him for a short time until your brother stops being angry .
ERV	Genesis	27	45	When your brother forgets what you did to him , I will send a servant to bring you back . I don ’ t want to lose both of my sons the same day. ”
ERV	Genesis	27	46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac , “ Your son Esau married Hittite women . I am very upset about this , because they are not our people . I ’ ll have nothing to live for if Jacob marries one of these women ! ” Footnotes - Genesis 27:36 Jacob This name is like the Hebrew word meaning “ heel. ” It also means “ the one who follows ” or “ tricky . ”
ERV	Genesis	28	28	Isaac called Jacob and blessed him . Then Isaac gave him a command and said , “ You must not marry a Canaanite woman .
ERV	Genesis	28	2	So leave this place and go to Paddan Aram . Go to the house of Bethuel , your mother ’ s father . Laban , your mother ’ s brother , lives there . Marry one of his daughters .
ERV	Genesis	28	3	I pray that God All-Powerful [ a ] will bless you and give you many children . I pray that you will become the father of a great nation
ERV	Genesis	28	4	and that God will bless you and your children the same way he blessed Abraham . And I pray that you will own the land where you live . This is the land God gave to Abraham. ”
ERV	Genesis	28	5	So Isaac sent Jacob to Rebekah ’ s brother in Paddan Aram . Jacob went to Laban , son of Bethuel the Aramean . Laban was the brother of Rebekah , the mother of Jacob and Esau .
ERV	Genesis	28	6	Esau learned that his father Isaac blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram to find a wife there . He also learned that Isaac commanded Jacob not to marry a Canaanite woman .
ERV	Genesis	28	7	Esau learned that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and went to Paddan Aram .
ERV	Genesis	28	8	Esau saw from this that his father did not want his sons to marry Canaanite women .
ERV	Genesis	28	9	Esau already had two wives , but he went to Abraham ’ s son Ishmael and married another woman , Mahalath , the daughter of Ishmael . Mahalath was Nebaioth ’ s sister . Jacob ’ s Dream at Bethel
ERV	Genesis	28	10	Jacob left Beersheba and went to Haran .
ERV	Genesis	28	11	The sun had already set when he came to a good place to spend the night . He took a rock there and laid his head on it to sleep .
ERV	Genesis	28	12	Jacob had a dream . He dreamed there was a ladder that was on the ground and reached up into heaven . He saw the angels of God going up and down the ladder .
ERV	Genesis	28	13	And then Jacob saw the Lord standing by the ladder . He said , “ I am the Lord , the God of your grandfather Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . I will give you the land that you are lying on now . I will give this land to you and to your children .
ERV	Genesis	28	14	You will have as many descendants as there are particles of dust on the earth . They will spread east and west , north and south . All the families on earth will be blessed because of you and your descendants .
ERV	Genesis	28	15	“ I am with you , and I will protect you everywhere you go . I will bring you back to this land . I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised. ”
ERV	Genesis	28	16	Then Jacob woke up and said , “ I know that the Lord is in this place , but I did not know he was here until I slept. ”
ERV	Genesis	28	17	Jacob was afraid and said , “ This is a very great place . This is the house of God . This is the gate to heaven. ”
ERV	Genesis	28	18	Jacob got up very early in the morning . He took the rock he had slept on and set it up on its edge . Then he poured oil on the rock . In this way he made it a memorial to God .
ERV	Genesis	28	19	The name of that place was Luz , but Jacob named it Bethel . [ b ]
ERV	Genesis	28	20	Then Jacob made a promise . He said , “ If God will be with me , and if he will protect me on this trip , and if he gives me food to eat and clothes to wear ,
ERV	Genesis	28	21	and if I return in peace to my father ’ s house—if he does all these things—then the Lord will be my God .
ERV	Genesis	28	22	I am setting this stone up as a memorial stone . It will show that this is a holy place for God , and I will give God one-tenth of all he gives me. ” Footnotes - Genesis 28:3 God All-Powerful Literally , “ El Shaddai. ” - Genesis 28:19 Bethel A town in Israel . This name means “ God ’ s house . ”
ERV	Genesis	29	29	( Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid . )
ERV	Genesis	29	2	He looked and saw a well in the field . There were three flocks of sheep lying near the well , where the sheep drank water . There was a large rock covering the mouth of the well .
ERV	Genesis	29	3	When all the flocks were gathered there , the shepherds would roll the rock away from the well . Then all the sheep could drink from the water . After the sheep were full , the shepherds would put the rock back in its place .
ERV	Genesis	29	4	Jacob said to the shepherds there , “ Brothers , where are you from ? ” They answered , “ We are from Haran. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	5	Then Jacob said , “ Do you know Laban , the son of Nahor ? ” The shepherds answered , “ We know him. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	6	Then Jacob said , “ How is he ? ” They answered , “ He is well . Look , that is his daughter Rachel coming now with his sheep. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	7	Jacob said , “ Look , it is still day and long before the sun sets . It is not yet time for the animals to be gathered together for the night . So give them water and let them go back into the field. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	8	But they said , “ We can not do that until all the flocks are gathered together . Then we will move the rock from the well , and all the sheep will drink. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	9	While Jacob was talking with the shepherds , Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep . ( It was her job to take care of the sheep . )
ERV	Genesis	29	10	Rachel was Laban ’ s daughter . Laban was the brother of Rebekah , Jacob ’ s mother . When Jacob saw Rachel , he went and moved the rock and gave water to the sheep .
ERV	Genesis	29	11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and cried .
ERV	Genesis	29	12	He told her that he was from her father ’ s family . He told her that he was the son of Rebekah . So Rachel ran home and told her father .
ERV	Genesis	29	13	When Laban heard the news about his sister ’ s son Jacob , he ran to meet him . Laban hugged him and kissed him and brought him to his house . Jacob told Laban everything that had happened .
ERV	Genesis	29	14	Then Laban said , “ This is wonderful ! You are from my own family. ” So Jacob stayed with Laban for a month . Laban Tricks Jacob
ERV	Genesis	29	15	One day Laban said to Jacob , “ You are a relative of mine . It is not right for you to continue working for me without pay . What should I pay you ? ”
ERV	Genesis	29	16	Now Laban had two daughters . The older was Leah and the younger was Rachel .
ERV	Genesis	29	17	Leah ’ s eyes were gentle , [ a ] but Rachel was beautiful .
ERV	Genesis	29	18	Jacob loved Rachel , so he said to Laban , “ I will work seven years for you if you will allow me to marry your daughter Rachel. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	19	Laban said , “ It would be better for her to marry you than someone else . So stay with me. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob stayed and worked for Laban for seven years . But it seemed like a very short time because he loved Rachel very much .
ERV	Genesis	29	21	After seven years Jacob said to Laban , “ Give me Rachel so that I can marry her . My time of work for you is finished. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	22	So Laban gave a party for all the people in that place .
ERV	Genesis	29	23	That night Laban brought his daughter Leah to Jacob . Jacob and Leah had sexual relations together .
ERV	Genesis	29	24	( Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter to be her maid . )
ERV	Genesis	29	25	In the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah he had slept with , and he said to Laban , “ You have tricked me . I worked hard for you so that I could marry Rachel . Why did you trick me ? ”
ERV	Genesis	29	26	Laban said , “ In our country we don ’ t allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter .
ERV	Genesis	29	27	Continue for the full week of the marriage ceremony , and I will also give you Rachel to marry . But you must serve me another seven years. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	28	So Jacob did this and finished the week . Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife .
ERV	Genesis	29	30	So Jacob had sexual relations with Rachel also . And Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah . Jacob worked for Laban for another seven years . Jacob ’ s Family Grows
ERV	Genesis	29	31	The Lord saw that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah , so he made it possible for Leah to have children . But Rachel did not have any children .
ERV	Genesis	29	32	Leah gave birth to a son , and she named him Reuben . [ b ] She named him this because she said , “ The Lord has seen my troubles . My husband does not love me . So now maybe my husband will love me. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	33	Leah became pregnant again and had another son . She named this son Simeon . [ c ] She said , “ The Lord has heard that I am not loved , so he gave me this son. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	34	Leah became pregnant again and had another son . She named this son Levi . [ d ] She said , “ Now , surely my husband will love me . I have given him three sons. ”
ERV	Genesis	29	35	Then Leah gave birth to another son . She named this son Judah . [ e ] Leah named him this because she said , “ Now I will praise the Lord. ” Then Leah stopped having children . Footnotes - Genesis 29:17 Leah ’ s eyes were gentle This might be a polite way of saying Leah was not very pretty . - Genesis 29:32 Reuben This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ Look , a son. ” - Genesis 29:33 Simeon This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ He hears. ” - Genesis 29:34 Levi This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ accompany , ” “ be joined together , ” or “ become close. ” - Genesis 29:35 Judah This name is like the word meaning “ He is praised . ”
ERV	Genesis	30	30	When I came , you had little . Now you have much , much more . Every time I did something for you , the Lord blessed you . Now it is time for me to work for myself—it is time to do things for my family. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	2	Jacob became angry with Rachel and said , “ I am not God . He is the one who has caused you to not have children. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	3	Then Rachel said , “ You can have my maid Bilhah . Sleep with her , and she will have a child for me . [ a ] Then I can be a mother through her. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	4	So Rachel gave Bilhah to her husband Jacob . He had sexual relations with Bilhah .
ERV	Genesis	30	5	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	30	6	Rachel said , “ God has listened to my prayer . He decided to give me a son. ” So she named this son Dan . [ b ]
ERV	Genesis	30	7	Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son .
ERV	Genesis	30	8	Rachel said , “ I have fought hard to compete with my sister , and I have won. ” So she named that son Naphtali . [ c ]
ERV	Genesis	30	9	Leah saw that she could have no more children . So she gave her slave girl Zilpah to Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	30	10	Then Zilpah had a son .
ERV	Genesis	30	11	Leah said , “ I am lucky. ” So she named the son Gad . [ d ]
ERV	Genesis	30	12	Zilpah gave birth to another son .
ERV	Genesis	30	13	Leah said , “ I am very happy ! Now women will call me happy. ” So she named that son Asher . [ e ]
ERV	Genesis	30	14	During the wheat harvest Reuben went into the fields and found some special flowers . [ f ] He brought them to his mother Leah . But Rachel said to Leah , “ Please give me some of your son ’ s flowers. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	15	Leah answered , “ You have already taken away my husband . Now you are trying to take away my son ’ s flowers. ” But Rachel answered , “ If you will give me your son ’ s flowers , you can sleep with Jacob tonight. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	16	Jacob came in from the fields that night . Leah saw him and went out to meet him . She said , “ You will sleep with me tonight . I have paid for you with my son ’ s flowers. ” So Jacob slept with Leah that night .
ERV	Genesis	30	17	Then God allowed Leah to become pregnant again . She gave birth to a fifth son .
ERV	Genesis	30	18	She said , “ God has given me a reward because I gave my slave to my husband. ” So she named her son Issachar . [ g ]
ERV	Genesis	30	19	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son .
ERV	Genesis	30	20	She said , “ God has given me a fine gift . Now surely Jacob will accept me , because I have given him six sons. ” So she named this son Zebulun . [ h ]
ERV	Genesis	30	21	Later , Leah gave birth to a daughter . She named her Dinah .
ERV	Genesis	30	22	Then God heard Rachel ’ s prayer and made it possible for Rachel to have children .
ERV	Genesis	30	23	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son . She said , “ God has taken away my shame. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	24	Rachel named the son Joseph , [ i ] saying , “ May the Lord give me another son. ” Jacob Tricks Laban
ERV	Genesis	30	25	After the birth of Joseph , Jacob said to Laban , “ Now let me go back to my own homeland .
ERV	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and my children . I have earned them by working for you . You know that I served you well. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	27	Laban said to him , “ Please , let me say something . I know [ j ] that the Lord has blessed me because of you .
ERV	Genesis	30	28	Tell me what I should pay you , and I will give it to you. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	29	Jacob answered , “ You know that I have worked hard for you . Your flocks have grown and been well while I cared for them .
ERV	Genesis	30	31	Laban asked , “ Then what should I give you ? ” Jacob answered , “ I don ’ t want you to give me anything ! I only want you to let me do this one thing : I will go back and take care of your sheep .
ERV	Genesis	30	32	But let me go through all your flocks today and take every lamb with spots or stripes . Let me take every black young goat and every female goat with stripes or spots . That will be my pay .
ERV	Genesis	30	33	In the future you can easily see if I am honest . You can come to look at my flocks . If I have any goat that isn ’ t spotted or any sheep that isn ’ t black , you will know that I stole it. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	34	Laban answered , “ I agree to that . We will do what you ask. ”
ERV	Genesis	30	35	But that day Laban hid all the male goats that had spots . And he hid all the female goats that had spots on them . He also hid all the black sheep . Laban told his sons to watch these sheep .
ERV	Genesis	30	36	So the sons took all the spotted animals and led them to another place . They traveled for three days . Jacob stayed and took care of all the animals that were left .
ERV	Genesis	30	37	Then Jacob cut green branches from poplar and almond trees . He stripped off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them .
ERV	Genesis	30	38	He put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places . When the animals came to drink , they also mated in that place .
ERV	Genesis	30	39	Then when the goats mated in front of the branches , the young that were born were spotted , striped , or black .
ERV	Genesis	30	40	Jacob separated the spotted and the black animals from the other animals in the flock . He kept his animals separate from Laban ’ s .
ERV	Genesis	30	41	Any time the stronger animals in the flock were mating , Jacob put the branches before their eyes . The animals mated near those branches .
ERV	Genesis	30	42	But when the weaker animals mated , Jacob did not put the branches there . So the young animals born from the weak animals were Laban ’ s . And the young animals born from the stronger animals were Jacob ’ s .
ERV	Genesis	30	43	In this way Jacob became very rich . He had large flocks , many servants , camels , and donkeys . Footnotes - Genesis 30:3 she will have a child for me Literally , “ she will give birth on my knees , and I , too , will have a son through her. ” - Genesis 30:6 Dan This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ to decide ” or “ to judge. ” - Genesis 30:8 Naphtali This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ my struggle. ” - Genesis 30:11 Gad This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ lucky ” or “ fortunate. ” - Genesis 30:13 Asher This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ blessed ” or “ happy. ” - Genesis 30:14 special flowers Or “ mandrakes. ” The Hebrew word means “ love plant. ” People thought these plants could help women have babies . - Genesis 30:18 Issachar This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ reward ” or “ salary. ” - Genesis 30:20 Zebulun This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ praise ” or “ honor. ” - Genesis 30:24 Joseph This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ to add. ” - Genesis 30:27 know Or “ guessed , ” “ divined , ” or “ concluded . ”
ERV	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered , “ I left without telling you , because I was afraid . I thought you would take your daughters away from me .
ERV	Genesis	31	2	Then Jacob noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been in the past .
ERV	Genesis	31	3	The Lord said to Jacob , “ Go back to your own land where your ancestors lived . I will be with you. ”
ERV	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob told Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks of sheep and goats .
ERV	Genesis	31	5	He said to them , “ I have noticed that your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be . But the God of my father has been with me .
ERV	Genesis	31	6	You both know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father .
ERV	Genesis	31	7	But he cheated me . He has changed my pay ten times . But during all this time , God protected me from all of Laban ’ s tricks .
ERV	Genesis	31	8	“ At one time Laban said , ‘ You can keep all the goats with spots . This will be your pay. ’ After he said this , all the animals gave birth to spotted goats , so they were all mine . But then Laban said , ‘ I will keep the spotted goats . You can have all the striped goats . That will be your pay. ’ After he said this , all the animals gave birth to striped goats .
ERV	Genesis	31	9	So God has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me .
ERV	Genesis	31	10	“ I had a dream during the time when the animals were mating . I saw that the only male goats that were mating were the ones with stripes and spots .
ERV	Genesis	31	11	The angel of God spoke to me in that dream . The angel said , ‘ Jacob ! ’ “ I answered , ‘ Yes ! ’
ERV	Genesis	31	12	“ The angel said , ‘ Look , only the striped and spotted goats are mating . I am causing this to happen . I have seen all the wrong things Laban has been doing to you . I am doing this so that you can have all the new baby goats .
ERV	Genesis	31	13	I am the God who came to you at Bethel , and there you made an altar , poured olive oil on it , and made a promise to me . Now I want you to be ready to go back to the country where you were born. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	31	14	years I worked to win your two daughters . The last six years I worked to earn your animals . And during that time you changed my pay ten times .
ERV	Genesis	31	15	He treated us like strangers . He sold us to you , and then he spent all the money that should have been ours .
ERV	Genesis	31	16	God took all this wealth from our father , and now it belongs to us and our children . So you should do whatever God told you to do. ”
ERV	Genesis	31	17	So Jacob prepared for the trip . He put his children and his wives on camels .
ERV	Genesis	31	18	Then they began traveling back to the land of Canaan , where his father lived . All the flocks of animals that Jacob owned walked ahead of them . He carried everything with him that he had gotten while he lived in Paddan Aram .
ERV	Genesis	31	19	While Laban was gone to cut the wool from his sheep , Rachel went into his house and stole the false gods that belonged to her father .
ERV	Genesis	31	20	years like a slave for you . For the first
ERV	Genesis	31	21	Jacob took his family and everything he owned and left quickly . They crossed the Euphrates River and traveled toward the hill country of Gilead .
ERV	Genesis	31	22	Three days later Laban learned that Jacob had run away .
ERV	Genesis	31	23	So he gathered his men together and began to chase Jacob . After seven days Laban found Jacob near the hill country of Gilead .
ERV	Genesis	31	24	That night God came to Laban in a dream and said , “ Be careful ! Be careful of every word you say to Jacob. ” The Search for the Stolen Gods
ERV	Genesis	31	25	The next morning Laban caught up with Jacob . Jacob had set up his camp on the mountain , so Laban and all his men set up their camp in the hill country of Gilead .
ERV	Genesis	31	26	Laban said to Jacob , “ Why did you trick me ? Why did you take my daughters like they were women you captured during war ?
ERV	Genesis	31	27	Why did you run away without telling me ? If you had told me , I would have given you a party . There would have been singing and dancing with music .
ERV	Genesis	31	28	You didn ’ t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye . You were very foolish to do this !
ERV	Genesis	31	29	I have the power to really hurt you . But last night the God of your father came to me in a dream . He warned me not to hurt you in any way .
ERV	Genesis	31	30	I know that you want to go back to your home . That is why you left . But why did you steal the gods from my house ? ”
ERV	Genesis	31	32	But I did not steal your gods . If you find anyone here with me who has taken your gods , they will be killed . Your men will be my witnesses . You can look for anything that belongs to you . Take anything that is yours. ” ( Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban ’ s gods . )
ERV	Genesis	31	33	So Laban went and looked through Jacob ’ s camp . He looked in Jacob ’ s tent and then in Leah ’ s tent . Then he looked in the tent where the two slave women stayed , but he did not find the gods from his house . Then he went into Rachel ’ s tent .
ERV	Genesis	31	34	Rachel had hidden the gods inside her camel ’ s saddle , and she was sitting on them . Laban looked through the whole tent , but he did not find the gods .
ERV	Genesis	31	35	And Rachel said to her father , “ Father , don ’ t be angry with me . I am not able to stand up before you . I am having my monthly time of bleeding. ” So Laban looked through the camp , but he did not find the gods from his house .
ERV	Genesis	31	36	Then Jacob became very angry and said , “ What wrong have I done ? What law have I broken ? What right do you have to chase me and stop me ?
ERV	Genesis	31	37	You looked through everything I own and found nothing that belongs to you . If you found something , show it to me . Put it here where our men can see it . Let our men decide which one of us is right .
ERV	Genesis	31	38	I have worked
ERV	Genesis	31	39	Any time a sheep was killed by wild animals , I always paid for the loss myself . I did not take the dead animal to you and say that it was not my fault . But I was robbed day and night .
ERV	Genesis	31	40	In the daytime the sun took away my strength , and at night sleep was taken from my eyes by the cold .
ERV	Genesis	31	41	I worked
ERV	Genesis	31	42	But the God of my ancestors , the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac , [ a ] was with me . If God had not been with me , you would have sent me away with nothing . But he saw the trouble that I had and the work that I did , and last night God proved that I am right. ” Jacob and Laban ’ s Treaty
ERV	Genesis	31	43	Laban said to Jacob , “ These women are my daughters . These children belong to me , and these animals are mine . Everything you see here belongs to me , but I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children .
ERV	Genesis	31	44	So I am ready to make an agreement with you . We will set up a pile of stones to show that we have an agreement. ”
ERV	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob found a large rock and put it there to show that he had made an agreement .
ERV	Genesis	31	46	He told his men to find some more rocks and to make a pile of rocks . Then they ate beside the pile of rocks .
ERV	Genesis	31	47	Laban named that place Yegar Sahadutha . [ b ] But Jacob named that place Galeed . [ c ]
ERV	Genesis	31	48	Laban said to Jacob , “ This pile of rocks will help us both remember our agreement. ” That is why Jacob called the place Galeed .
ERV	Genesis	31	49	Then Laban said , “ Let the Lord watch over us while we are separated from each other. ” So that place was also named Mizpah . [ d ]
ERV	Genesis	31	50	Then Laban said , “ If you hurt my daughters , remember that God will punish you . If you marry other women , remember that God is watching .
ERV	Genesis	31	51	Here are the rocks that I have put between us , and here is the special rock to show that we made an agreement .
ERV	Genesis	31	52	This pile of rocks and this one special rock both help us to remember our agreement . I will never go past these rocks to fight against you , and you must never go on my side of these rocks to fight against me .
ERV	Genesis	31	53	May the God of Abraham , the God of Nahor , and the God of their ancestors judge us guilty if we break this agreement. ” Jacob ’ s father , Isaac , called God “ Fear. ” So Jacob used that name to make the promise .
ERV	Genesis	31	54	Then Jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice on the mountain . And he invited his men to come and share a meal . After they finished eating , they spent the night on the mountain .
ERV	Genesis	31	55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters goodbye . He blessed them and went back home . Footnotes - Genesis 31:42 Fear of Isaac A name for God . - Genesis 31:47 Yegar Sahadutha Aramaic words meaning “ rock pile of the agreement. ” - Genesis 31:47 Galeed Another name for Gilead . This Hebrew name means “ rock pile of the agreement. ” - Genesis 31:49 Mizpah This means “ a place to watch from . ”
ERV	Genesis	32	32	So even today , the people of Israel don ’ t eat the muscle that is on the hip joint , because this is the muscle where Jacob was hurt . Footnotes - Genesis 32:2 Mahanaim This name means “ two camps. ” - Genesis 32:28 Israel This name might mean “ he fights for God , ” “ he fights with God , ” or “ God fights. ” - Genesis 32:30 Peniel A name that means “ the face of God . ”
ERV	Genesis	32	2	When he saw them , he said , “ This is God ’ s camp ! ” So Jacob named that place Mahanaim . [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	32	3	Jacob ’ s brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the hill country of Edom . Jacob sent messengers to Esau .
ERV	Genesis	32	4	He told them , “ Tell this to my master Esau : ‘ Your servant Jacob says , I have lived with Laban all these years .
ERV	Genesis	32	5	I have many cattle , donkeys , flocks , and servants . Sir , I am sending you this message to ask you to accept us. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	32	6	The messengers came back to Jacob and said , “ We went to your brother Esau . He is coming to meet you . He has
ERV	Genesis	32	400	men with him. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	7	Jacob was very frightened and worried . He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks , herds , and camels into two groups .
ERV	Genesis	32	8	Jacob thought , “ If Esau comes and destroys one group , the other group can run away and be saved. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	9	Then Jacob said , “ God of my father Abraham ! God of my father Isaac ! Lord , you told me to come back to my country and to my family . You said that you would do good to me .
ERV	Genesis	32	10	male donkeys .
ERV	Genesis	32	11	I ask you to please save me from my brother Esau . I am afraid that he will come and kill us all , even the mothers with the children .
ERV	Genesis	32	12	Lord , you said to me , ‘ I will be good to you . I will increase your family and make your children as many as the sands of the sea . There will be too many to count. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	32	13	Jacob stayed in that place for the night . He prepared some things to give to Esau as a gift .
ERV	Genesis	32	14	He took
ERV	Genesis	32	200	female sheep and
ERV	Genesis	32	20	You will say , ‘ This is a gift to you , and your servant Jacob is behind us. ’ ” Jacob thought , “ If I send these men ahead with gifts , maybe Esau will forgive me and accept me. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	15	He took
ERV	Genesis	32	30	So Jacob named that place Peniel . [ c ] He said , “ At this place , I saw God face to face , but my life was spared. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	40	cows and
ERV	Genesis	32	16	He gave each flock of animals to his servants . Then he said to them , “ Separate each group of animals . Go ahead of me and keep some space between each herd. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	17	Jacob gave them their orders . To the servant with the first group of animals he said , “ When Esau my brother comes to you and asks you , ‘ Whose animals are these ? Where are you going ? Whose servant are you ? ’
ERV	Genesis	32	18	then you should answer , ‘ These animals belong to your servant Jacob . He sent them as a gift to you , my master Esau . And he also is coming behind us. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	32	19	Jacob also ordered the second servant , the third servant , and all the other servants to do the same thing . He said , “ You will say the same thing to Esau when you meet him .
ERV	Genesis	32	21	So Jacob sent the gifts to Esau , but he stayed that night in the camp .
ERV	Genesis	32	22	During the night , Jacob got up and began moving his two wives , his two maids , and his eleven sons across the Jabbok River at the crossing .
ERV	Genesis	32	23	After he sent his family across the river , he sent across everything he had . The Fight With God
ERV	Genesis	32	24	Jacob was left alone , and a man came and wrestled with him . The man fought with him until the sun came up .
ERV	Genesis	32	25	When the man saw that he could not defeat Jacob , he touched Jacob ’ s leg and put it out of joint .
ERV	Genesis	32	26	Then the man said to Jacob , “ Let me go . The sun is coming up. ” But Jacob said , “ I will not let you go . You must bless me. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	27	And the man said to him , “ What is your name ? ” And Jacob said , “ My name is Jacob. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	28	Then the man said , “ Your name will not be Jacob . Your name will now be Israel . [ b ] I give you this name because you have fought with God and with men , and you have won. ”
ERV	Genesis	32	29	Then Jacob asked him , “ Please tell me your name. ” But the man said , “ Why do you ask my name ? ” Then the man blessed Jacob at that place .
ERV	Genesis	32	31	Then the sun came up as Jacob left Peniel . He was limping because of his leg .
ERV	Genesis	33	33	Jacob looked and saw Esau coming with
ERV	Genesis	33	400	men . Jacob divided his family into four groups . Leah and her children were in one group , Rachel and Joseph were in one group , and the two maids and their children were in two groups .
ERV	Genesis	33	2	Jacob put the maids with their children first . Then he put Leah and her children behind them , and he put Rachel and Joseph in the last place .
ERV	Genesis	33	3	Jacob himself went out before them . While he was walking toward his brother Esau , he bowed down to the ground seven times .
ERV	Genesis	33	4	When Esau saw Jacob , he ran to meet him . He put his arms around Jacob , hugged his neck , and kissed him . Then they both cried .
ERV	Genesis	33	5	Esau looked up and saw the women and children . He said , “ Who are all these people with you ? ” Jacob answered , “ These are the children that God gave me . God has been good to me. ”
ERV	Genesis	33	6	Then the two maids and the children with them went to Esau . They bowed down before him .
ERV	Genesis	33	7	Then Leah and the children with her went to Esau and bowed down . And then Rachel and Joseph went to him and bowed down .
ERV	Genesis	33	8	Esau said , “ Who were all those people I saw while I was coming here ? And what were all those animals for ? ” Jacob answered , “ These are my gifts to you so that you might accept me. ”
ERV	Genesis	33	9	But Esau said , “ You don ’ t have to give me gifts , brother . I have enough for myself. ”
ERV	Genesis	33	10	Jacob said , “ No , I beg you ! If you really accept me , please accept the gifts I give you . I am very happy to see your face again . It is like seeing the face of God . I am very happy to see that you accept me .
ERV	Genesis	33	11	So I beg you to also accept the gifts I give you . God has been very good to me . I have more than I need. ” Because Jacob begged Esau to take the gifts , he accepted them .
ERV	Genesis	33	12	Then Esau said , “ Now you can continue your journey . I will go with you. ”
ERV	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , “ You know that my children are weak . And I must be careful with my flocks and their young animals . If I force them to walk too far in one day , all the animals will die .
ERV	Genesis	33	14	So you go on ahead . I will follow you slowly . I will go slowly enough for the cattle and other animals to be safe and so that my children will not get too tired . I will meet you in Seir. ”
ERV	Genesis	33	15	So Esau said , “ Then I will leave some of my men to help you. ” But Jacob said , “ That is very kind of you , but there is no need to do that. ”
ERV	Genesis	33	16	So that day Esau started on his trip back to Seir .
ERV	Genesis	33	17	But Jacob went to Succoth . [ a ] There he built a house for himself and small barns for his cattle . That is why the place was named Succoth .
ERV	Genesis	33	18	Jacob safely ended his trip from Paddan Aram when he came to the town of Shechem in Canaan . He made his camp in a field near the city .
ERV	Genesis	33	19	He bought the field where he camped from the family of Hamor , father of Shechem . He paid
ERV	Genesis	33	100	pieces of silver for it .
ERV	Genesis	33	20	He built an altar there to honor God . He named the place “ El , [ b ] the God of Israel. ” Footnotes - Genesis 33:17 Succoth A town east of the Jordan River . This name means “ temporary shelters. ” - Genesis 33:20 El A Hebrew name for God .
ERV	Genesis	34	34	One day , Dinah , the daughter of Leah and Jacob , went out to see the women of that place .
ERV	Genesis	34	2	She was seen by Shechem , the son of Hamor the Hivite , who ruled that area . Shechem took Dinah and raped her .
ERV	Genesis	34	3	But he was so attracted to her that he fell in love and began expressing his feelings to her .
ERV	Genesis	34	4	He told his father , “ Please get this girl for me so that I can marry her. ”
ERV	Genesis	34	5	Jacob learned that Shechem had done this very bad thing to his daughter . But all his sons were out in the fields with the cattle . So he did nothing until they came home .
ERV	Genesis	34	6	Then Shechem ’ s father , Hamor , came out to talk with Jacob .
ERV	Genesis	34	7	In the fields Jacob ’ s sons heard the news about what had happened . They were very angry because Shechem had brought shame to Israel by raping Jacob ’ s daughter . They came in from the fields as soon as they heard about the terrible thing Shechem had done .
ERV	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor talked to Dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ My son Shechem wants Dinah very much . Please let him marry her .
ERV	Genesis	34	9	This marriage will show we have a special agreement . Then our men can marry your women , and your men can marry our women .
ERV	Genesis	34	10	You can live in the same land with us . You will be free to own the land and to trade here. ”
ERV	Genesis	34	11	Shechem also talked to Jacob and to Dinah ’ s brothers and said , “ Please accept me . I will do anything you ask me to do .
ERV	Genesis	34	12	I will give you any gift [ a ] you want if you will only allow me to marry Dinah . I will give you anything you ask , but let me marry her. ”
ERV	Genesis	34	13	Jacob ’ s sons decided to lie to Shechem and his father because Shechem had done such a bad thing to their sister Dinah .
ERV	Genesis	34	14	The brothers said to them , “ We can not allow our sister to marry you because you are not yet circumcised . That would bring us shame .
ERV	Genesis	34	15	But we will allow you to marry her if you do this one thing : Every man in your town must be circumcised like us .
ERV	Genesis	34	16	Then your men can marry our women , and our men can marry your women . Then we will become one people .
ERV	Genesis	34	17	If you refuse to be circumcised , we will take Dinah away. ”
ERV	Genesis	34	18	This agreement made Hamor and Shechem very happy .
ERV	Genesis	34	19	Shechem was very happy to do what Dinah ’ s brothers asked . Shechem was the most honored man in his family .
ERV	Genesis	34	20	Hamor and Shechem went to the meeting place of their city . They spoke to the men of the city and said ,
ERV	Genesis	34	21	“ These people want to be friends with us . We want to let them live in our land and be at peace with us . We have enough land for all of us . We are free to marry their women , and we are happy to give them our women to marry .
ERV	Genesis	34	22	But there is one thing that all our men must agree to do . They must agree to be circumcised as they are .
ERV	Genesis	34	23	If we do this , we will become rich from all their cattle and other animals . We should make this agreement with them so that they will stay here with us. ”
ERV	Genesis	34	24	All the men who heard this in the meeting place agreed with Hamor and Shechem . And every man was circumcised at that time .
ERV	Genesis	34	25	Three days later the men who were circumcised were still sore . Two of Jacob ’ s sons , Simeon and Levi , knew that the men would be weak at this time . So they went to the city and killed all the men there .
ERV	Genesis	34	26	Dinah ’ s brothers , Simeon and Levi , killed Hamor and his son Shechem . Then they took Dinah out of Shechem ’ s house and left .
ERV	Genesis	34	27	Jacob ’ s sons went to the city and stole everything that was there because of what Shechem had done to their sister .
ERV	Genesis	34	28	So the brothers took all their animals , all their donkeys , and everything else in the city and in the fields .
ERV	Genesis	34	29	The brothers took everything those people owned . They even took their wives and children .
ERV	Genesis	34	30	But Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ You have caused me a lot of trouble . All the people in this place will hate me . All the Canaanites and the Perizzites will turn against me . There are only a few of us . If the people in this place gather together to fight against us , I will be destroyed . And all our people will be destroyed with me. ”
ERV	Genesis	34	31	But the brothers said , “ Should we let these people treat our sister like a prostitute ? They were wrong to do that to our sister ! ” Footnotes - Genesis 34:12 gift Or “ dowry. ” Here , the money a man paid for a wife .
ERV	Genesis	35	35	God said to Jacob , “ Go to the town of Bethel . [ a ] That is where I appeared to you when you were running away from your brother Esau . Live there and make an altar to honor me as El , [ b ] the God who appeared to you. ”
ERV	Genesis	35	2	So Jacob told his family and all the other people with him , “ Destroy all these foreign gods that you have . Make yourselves pure . Put on clean clothes .
ERV	Genesis	35	3	We will leave here and go to Bethel . There I will build an altar to the God who has always helped me during times of trouble . He has been with me wherever I have gone. ”
ERV	Genesis	35	4	So the people gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had , and they gave him all the rings they were wearing in their ears . He buried everything under an oak tree near the town called Shechem .
ERV	Genesis	35	5	Then Jacob and his sons left that place . The people in the surrounding cities wanted to follow and kill them , but God filled them with such great fear that they did not go after them .
ERV	Genesis	35	6	So Jacob and his people went to Luz , which is now called Bethel . It is in the land of Canaan .
ERV	Genesis	35	7	Jacob built an altar there . He named the place “ El Bethel. ” [ c ] Jacob chose this name because that is the place where God first appeared to him when he was running from his brother .
ERV	Genesis	35	8	Deborah , Rebekah ’ s nurse , died there . They buried her under the oak tree at Bethel . They named that place Allon Bacuth . [ d ] Jacob ’ s New Name
ERV	Genesis	35	9	When Jacob came back from Paddan Aram , God appeared to him again . God blessed Jacob
ERV	Genesis	35	10	and said to him , “ Your name is Jacob , but I will change that name . You will no longer be called Jacob . Your new name will be Israel . [ e ] ” So God named him Israel .
ERV	Genesis	35	11	God said to him , “ I am God All-Powerful , [ f ] and I give you this blessing : Have many children and grow into a great nation . Other nations and other kings will come out of you .
ERV	Genesis	35	12	I gave Abraham and Isaac some special land . Now I give the land to you and to all your people who will live after you. ”
ERV	Genesis	35	13	Then God left that place . 14-15 Jacob set up a memorial stone there . He made the rock holy by pouring wine and oil on it . This was a special place because God spoke to Jacob there , and Jacob named the place Bethel . Rachel Dies Giving Birth
ERV	Genesis	35	16	Jacob and his group left Bethel . Before they came to Ephrath , Rachel began giving birth to her baby .
ERV	Genesis	35	17	She was having a lot of trouble with this birth . She was in great pain . When her nurse saw this , she said , “ Don ’ t be afraid , Rachel . You are giving birth to another son. ”
ERV	Genesis	35	18	Rachel died while giving birth to the son . Before dying , she named the boy Benoni . [ g ] But Jacob called him Benjamin . [ h ]
ERV	Genesis	35	19	Rachel was buried on the road to Ephrath ( that is , Bethlehem ) .
ERV	Genesis	35	20	Jacob put a special rock on Rachel ’ s grave to honor her . That special rock is still there today .
ERV	Genesis	35	21	Then Israel continued his journey . He camped just south of Eder tower . [ i ]
ERV	Genesis	35	22	Israel stayed there for a short time . While he was there , Reuben slept with Israel ’ s slave woman Bilhah . Israel heard about this , and he was very angry . [ j ] The Family of Israel ( Jacob ) These are the names of Jacob ’ s twelve sons :

ERV	Genesis	37	37	Jacob stayed and lived in the land of Canaan . This is the same land where his father had lived .
ERV	Genesis	37	2	This is the story of Jacob ’ s family . Joseph was a young man ,
ERV	Genesis	37	17	The man said , “ They have already gone away . I heard them say that they were going to Dothan. ” So Joseph followed his brothers and found them in Dothan . Joseph Sold Into Slavery
ERV	Genesis	37	3	Joseph was born at a time when his father Israel was very old , so Israel loved him more than he loved his other sons . Jacob gave him a special coat , which was long and very beautiful . [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	37	4	When Joseph ’ s brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than he loved them , they hated their brother because of this . They refused to say nice things to him .
ERV	Genesis	37	5	One time Joseph had a special dream . Later , he told his brothers about this dream , and after that his brothers hated him even more .
ERV	Genesis	37	6	Joseph said , “ I had a dream .
ERV	Genesis	37	7	We were all working in the field , tying stacks of wheat together . Then my stack got up . It stood there while all of your stacks of wheat made a circle around mine and bowed down to it. ”
ERV	Genesis	37	8	His brothers said , “ Do you think this means that you will be a king and rule over us ? ” His brothers hated Joseph more now because of the dreams he had about them .
ERV	Genesis	37	9	Then Joseph had another dream , and he told his brothers about it . He said , “ I had another dream . I saw the sun , the moon , and eleven stars bowing down to me. ”
ERV	Genesis	37	10	Joseph also told his father about this dream , but his father criticized him . His father said , “ What kind of dream is this ? Do you believe that your mother , your brothers , and I will bow down to you ? ”
ERV	Genesis	37	11	Joseph ’ s brothers continued to be jealous of him , but his father thought about all these things and wondered what they could mean .
ERV	Genesis	37	12	One day Joseph ’ s brothers went to Shechem to care for their father ’ s sheep .
ERV	Genesis	37	13	Jacob said to Joseph , “ Go to Shechem . Your brothers are there with my sheep. ” Joseph answered , “ I will go. ”
ERV	Genesis	37	14	His father said , “ Go and see if your brothers are safe . Come back and tell me if my sheep are all fine. ” So Joseph ’ s father sent him from the Valley of Hebron to Shechem .
ERV	Genesis	37	15	At Shechem , Joseph got lost . A man found him wandering in the fields . The man said , “ What are you looking for ? ”
ERV	Genesis	37	16	Joseph answered , “ I am looking for my brothers . Can you tell me where they are with their sheep ? ”
ERV	Genesis	37	18	Joseph ’ s brothers saw him coming from far away . They decided to make a plan to kill him .
ERV	Genesis	37	19	They said to each other , “ Here comes Joseph the dreamer .
ERV	Genesis	37	20	pieces of silver . The traders took him to Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	37	21	But Reuben wanted to save Joseph . He said , “ Let ’ s not kill him .
ERV	Genesis	37	22	We can put him into a well without hurting him. ” Reuben planned to save Joseph and send him back to his father .
ERV	Genesis	37	23	When Joseph came to his brothers , they attacked him and tore off his long and beautiful coat .
ERV	Genesis	37	24	Then they threw him into an empty well that was dry .
ERV	Genesis	37	25	While Joseph was in the well , the brothers sat down to eat . They looked up and saw a group of traders [ b ] traveling from Gilead to Egypt . Their camels were carrying many different spices and riches .
ERV	Genesis	37	26	So Judah said to his brothers , “ What profit will we get if we kill our brother and hide his death ?
ERV	Genesis	37	27	We will profit more if we sell him to these traders . Then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother. ” The other brothers agreed .
ERV	Genesis	37	28	When the Midianite traders came by , the brothers took Joseph out of the well and sold him to the traders for
ERV	Genesis	37	29	Reuben had been gone , but when he came back to the well , he saw that Joseph was not there . He tore his clothes to show that he was upset .
ERV	Genesis	37	30	Reuben went to the brothers and said , “ The boy is not in the well ! What will I do ? ”
ERV	Genesis	37	31	The brothers killed a goat and put the goat ’ s blood on Joseph ’ s beautiful coat .
ERV	Genesis	37	32	Then the brothers showed the coat to their father . And the brothers said , “ We found this coat . Is this Joseph ’ s coat ? ”
ERV	Genesis	37	33	His father saw the coat and knew that it was Joseph ’ s . He said , “ Yes , that is his ! Maybe some wild animal has killed him . My son Joseph has been eaten by a wild animal ! ”
ERV	Genesis	37	34	Jacob was so sorry about his son that he tore his clothes . Then Jacob put on special clothes to show that he was sad . He continued to be sad about his son for a long time .
ERV	Genesis	37	35	All of Jacob ’ s sons and daughters tried to comfort him , but Jacob was never comforted . He said , “ I will be sad about my son until the day I die. ” So Jacob continued to mourn his son Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	37	36	The Midianite traders later sold Joseph in Egypt . They sold him to Potiphar , an officer of the king of Egypt and the captain of his palace guards . Footnotes - Genesis 37:3 beautiful The Hebrew means “ striped , ” or possibly , “ many colored. ” - Genesis 37:25 traders Literally , “ Ishmaelites . ”
ERV	Genesis	38	38	About that time , Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah from the town of Adullam .
ERV	Genesis	38	2	Judah met a Canaanite girl there and married her . The girl ’ s father was named Shua .
ERV	Genesis	38	3	The Canaanite girl gave birth to a son and named him Er .
ERV	Genesis	38	4	Later , she gave birth to another son and named him Onan .
ERV	Genesis	38	5	Then she had another son named Shelah . Judah lived in Kezib when his third son was born .
ERV	Genesis	38	6	Judah chose a woman named Tamar to be the wife of his first son Er .
ERV	Genesis	38	7	But Er did many bad things . The Lord was not happy with him , so the Lord killed him .
ERV	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Er ’ s brother Onan , “ Go and sleep with your dead brother ’ s wife . [ a ] Become like a husband to her . If children are born , they will belong to your brother Er. ”
ERV	Genesis	38	9	Onan knew that the children from this union would not belong to him . He had sexual relations with Tamar , but he did not allow himself to stay inside her .
ERV	Genesis	38	10	This made the Lord angry . So he killed Onan also .
ERV	Genesis	38	11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar , “ Go back to your father ’ s house . Stay there and don ’ t marry until my young son Shelah grows up. ” Judah was afraid that Shelah would also be killed like his brothers . So Tamar went back to her father ’ s home .
ERV	Genesis	38	12	Later , Judah ’ s wife , the daughter of Shua , died . After Judah ’ s time of sadness , he went to Timnah with his friend Hirah from Adullam . Judah went to Timnah to have the wool cut from his sheep .
ERV	Genesis	38	13	Tamar learned that Judah , her father-in-law , was going to Timnah to cut the wool from his sheep .
ERV	Genesis	38	14	Tamar always wore clothes that showed that she was a widow . So she put on some different clothes and covered her face with a veil . Then she sat down near the road going to Enaim , a town near Timnah . Tamar knew that Judah ’ s younger son Shelah was now grown up , but Judah would not make plans for her to marry him .
ERV	Genesis	38	15	Judah traveled on that road and saw her , but he thought that she was a prostitute . ( Her face was covered with a veil like a prostitute . )
ERV	Genesis	38	16	So he went to her and said , “ Let me have sex with you. ” ( Judah did not know that she was Tamar , his daughter-in-law . ) She said , “ How much will you give me ? ”
ERV	Genesis	38	17	Judah answered , “ I will send you a young goat from my flock. ” She answered , “ I agree to that . But first you must give me something to keep until you send me the goat. ”
ERV	Genesis	38	18	Judah asked , “ What do you want me to give you as proof that I will send you the goat ? ” Tamar answered , “ Give me your seal and its string [ b ] and your walking stick. ” Judah gave these things to her . Then Judah and Tamar had sexual relations , and she became pregnant .
ERV	Genesis	38	19	Then Tamar went home , took off her veil that covered her face , and again put on the special clothes that showed she was a widow .
ERV	Genesis	38	20	Later , Judah sent his friend Hirah to Enaim to give the prostitute the goat he promised . Judah also told Hirah to get the special seal and the walking stick from her , but Hirah could not find her .
ERV	Genesis	38	21	He asked some of the men at the town of Enaim , “ Where is the prostitute who was here by the road ? ” The men answered , “ There has never been a prostitute here. ”
ERV	Genesis	38	22	So Judah ’ s friend went back to Judah and said , “ I could not find the woman . The men who live in that place said that there was never a prostitute there. ”
ERV	Genesis	38	23	So Judah said , “ Let her keep the things . I don ’ t want people to laugh at us . I tried to give her the goat , but we could not find her . That is enough. ” Tamar Is Pregnant
ERV	Genesis	38	24	About three months later , someone told Judah , “ Your daughter-in-law Tamar sinned like a prostitute , and now she is pregnant. ” Then Judah said , “ Take her out and burn her. ”
ERV	Genesis	38	25	. - Genesis 38:29 Perez This name is like the word meaning “ to break out. ” - Genesis 38:30 Zerah This name is like the word meaning “ bright . ”
ERV	Genesis	38	26	Judah recognized these things and said , “ She is right . I was wrong . I did not give her my son Shelah like I promised. ” And Judah did not sleep with her again .
ERV	Genesis	38	27	The time came for Tamar to give birth . She was going to have twins .
ERV	Genesis	38	28	While she was giving birth , one baby put his hand out . The nurse tied a red string on the hand and said , “ This baby was born first. ”
ERV	Genesis	38	29	But that baby pulled his hand back in , so the other baby was born first . So the nurse said , “ You were able to break out first ! ” So they named him Perez . [ c ]
ERV	Genesis	38	30	After this , the other baby was born . This was the baby with the red string on his hand . They named him Zerah .

This was like signing the agreement . Also in verse
ERV	Genesis	39	39	The traders [ a ] who bought Joseph took him down to Egypt . They sold him to the captain of Pharaoh ’ s guard , Potiphar .
ERV	Genesis	39	2	The Lord helped Joseph become a successful man . Joseph lived in the house of his master , Potiphar the Egyptian .
ERV	Genesis	39	3	Potiphar saw that the Lord was with Joseph and that the Lord helped Joseph be successful in everything he did .
ERV	Genesis	39	4	So Potiphar was very happy with Joseph . He allowed Joseph to work for him and to help him rule the house . Joseph was the ruler over everything Potiphar owned .
ERV	Genesis	39	5	After Joseph was made the ruler over the house , the Lord blessed the house and everything that Potiphar owned . The Lord also blessed everything that grew in Potiphar ’ s fields . The Lord did this because of Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	39	6	So Potiphar allowed Joseph to take responsibility for everything in the house . Potiphar didn ’ t have to worry about anything except deciding what to eat . Joseph Refuses Potiphar ’ s Wife Joseph was a very handsome , good-looking man .
ERV	Genesis	39	7	After some time , the wife of Joseph ’ s master began to pay special attention to him . One day she said to him , “ Sleep with me. ”
ERV	Genesis	39	8	But Joseph refused . He said , “ My master trusts me with everything in his house . He has given me responsibility for everything here .
ERV	Genesis	39	9	My master has made me almost equal to him in his house . I can not sleep with his wife ! That is wrong ! It is a sin against God. ”
ERV	Genesis	39	10	The woman talked with Joseph every day , but he refused to sleep with her .
ERV	Genesis	39	11	One day Joseph went into the house to do his work . He was the only man in the house at the time .
ERV	Genesis	39	12	His master ’ s wife grabbed his coat and said to him , “ Come to bed with me. ” But Joseph ran out of the house so fast that he left his coat in her hand .
ERV	Genesis	39	13	The woman saw that Joseph had left his coat in her hand and had run out of the house .
ERV	Genesis	39	14	She called to the men outside and said , “ Look ! This Hebrew slave was brought here to make fun of us . He came in and tried to attack me , but I screamed .
ERV	Genesis	39	15	My scream scared him and he ran away , but he left his coat with me. ”
ERV	Genesis	39	16	Then she kept his coat until her husband , Joseph ’ s master , came home .
ERV	Genesis	39	17	She told her husband the same story . She said , “ This Hebrew slave you brought here tried to attack me !
ERV	Genesis	39	18	But when he came near me , I screamed . He ran away , but he left his coat. ”
ERV	Genesis	39	19	Joseph ’ s master listened to what his wife said , and he became very angry .
ERV	Genesis	39	20	So Potiphar put Joseph into the prison where the king ’ s enemies were held , and that is where Joseph remained . Joseph in Prison
ERV	Genesis	39	21	The Lord was with Joseph and continued to show his kindness to him , so the commander of the prison guards began to like Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	39	22	The commander of the guards put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners . Joseph was their leader , but he still did the same work they did .
ERV	Genesis	39	23	The commander of the guards trusted Joseph with everything that was in the prison . This happened because the Lord was with Joseph . The Lord helped Joseph be successful in everything he did . Footnotes - Genesis 39:1 traders Literally , “ Ishmaelites . ”
ERV	Genesis	40	40	Later , two of Pharaoh ’ s servants did something wrong to Pharaoh . These servants were the baker and the man who served wine to Pharaoh .
ERV	Genesis	40	2	Pharaoh became angry with his baker and wine server ,
ERV	Genesis	40	3	so he put them in the same prison as Joseph . Potiphar , the commander of Pharaoh ’ s guards , was in charge of this prison .
ERV	Genesis	40	4	The commander put the two prisoners under Joseph ’ s care . The two men continued to stay in prison for some time .
ERV	Genesis	40	5	One night both of the prisoners had a dream . The baker and the wine server each had his own dream , and each dream had its own meaning .
ERV	Genesis	40	6	Joseph went to them the next morning and saw that the two men were worried .
ERV	Genesis	40	7	He asked them , “ Why do you look so worried today ? ”
ERV	Genesis	40	8	The two men answered , “ We both had dreams last night , but we don ’ t understand what we dreamed . There is no one to explain the dreams to us. ” Joseph said to them , “ God is the only one who can understand and explain dreams . So I beg you , tell me your dreams. ” The Wine Server ’ s Dream
ERV	Genesis	40	9	So the wine server told Joseph his dream . The server said , “ I dreamed I saw a vine .
ERV	Genesis	40	10	On the vine there were three branches . I watched the branches grow flowers and then become grapes .
ERV	Genesis	40	11	I was holding Pharaoh ’ s cup , so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup . Then I gave the cup to Pharaoh. ”
ERV	Genesis	40	12	Then Joseph said , “ I will explain the dream to you . The three branches mean three days .
ERV	Genesis	40	13	Before the end of three days , Pharaoh will forgive you and allow you to go back to your work . You will do the same work for Pharaoh as you did before .
ERV	Genesis	40	14	But when you are free , remember me . Be good to me and help me . Tell Pharaoh about me so that I can get out of this prison .
ERV	Genesis	40	15	I was kidnapped and taken from the land of my people , the Hebrews . I have done nothing wrong ! I should not be in prison. ” The Baker ’ s Dream
ERV	Genesis	40	16	The baker saw that the other servant ’ s dream was good , so he said to Joseph , “ I also had a dream . I dreamed there were three baskets of bread on my head .
ERV	Genesis	40	17	In the top basket there were all kinds of baked food for the king , but birds were eating this food. ”
ERV	Genesis	40	18	Joseph answered , “ I will tell you what the dream means . The three baskets mean three days .
ERV	Genesis	40	19	Before the end of three days , the king will take you out of this prison and cut off your head ! He will hang your body on a pole , and the birds will eat it. ” Joseph Is Forgotten
ERV	Genesis	40	20	Three days later it was Pharaoh ’ s birthday . He gave a party for all his servants . At the party Pharaoh allowed the wine server and the baker to leave the prison .
ERV	Genesis	40	21	He freed the wine server and gave him his job back , and once again the wine server put a cup of wine in Pharaoh ’ s hand .
ERV	Genesis	40	22	But Pharaoh hanged the baker , and everything happened the way Joseph said it would .
ERV	Genesis	40	23	But the wine server did not remember to help Joseph . He said nothing about him to Pharaoh . The wine server forgot about Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	41	41	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I now make you governor over all of Egypt. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	2	In the dream , seven cows came out of the river and stood there eating grass . They were healthy , good-looking cows .
ERV	Genesis	41	3	Then seven more cows came out of the river and stood on the bank of the river by the healthy cows . But these cows were thin and looked sick .
ERV	Genesis	41	4	The seven sick cows ate the seven healthy cows . Then Pharaoh woke up .
ERV	Genesis	41	5	Pharaoh went back to sleep and began dreaming again . This time he dreamed that he saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant . They were healthy and full of grain .
ERV	Genesis	41	6	Then he saw seven more heads of grain sprouting , but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind .
ERV	Genesis	41	7	The thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain . Then Pharaoh woke up again and realized it was only a dream .
ERV	Genesis	41	8	The next morning Pharaoh was worried about these dreams , so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt . Pharaoh told these men the dreams , but none of them could explain the dreams . The Servant Tells Pharaoh About Joseph
ERV	Genesis	41	9	Then the wine servant remembered Joseph and said to Pharaoh , “ I remember something that happened to me .
ERV	Genesis	41	10	You were angry with the baker and me , and you put us in prison .
ERV	Genesis	41	11	Then one night he and I had a dream . Each dream had a different meaning .
ERV	Genesis	41	12	There was a young Hebrew man in prison with us . He was a servant of the commander of the guards . We told him our dreams , and he explained them to us . He told us the meaning of each dream ,
ERV	Genesis	41	13	and what he said came true . He said I would be free and have my old job back , and it happened . He also said the baker would die , and it happened ! ” Joseph Is Called to Explain the Dreams
ERV	Genesis	41	14	So Pharaoh called Joseph from the prison . The guards quickly got Joseph out of prison . Joseph shaved , put on some clean clothes , and went to see Pharaoh .
ERV	Genesis	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I had a dream , and no one can explain it for me . I heard that you can explain dreams when someone tells you about them. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	16	Joseph answered , “ I can not ! But God can explain the dream for you , Pharaoh. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	17	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ In my dream I was standing by the Nile River .
ERV	Genesis	41	18	Seven cows came up out of the river and stood there eating the grass . They were healthy , good-looking cows .
ERV	Genesis	41	19	Then I saw seven more cows come up out of the river after them , but these cows were thin and looked sick . They were the worst cows I had ever seen anywhere in Egypt !
ERV	Genesis	41	20	The thin , sick cows ate the first healthy cows ,
ERV	Genesis	41	21	but they still looked thin and sick . You couldn ’ t even tell they had eaten the healthy cows . They looked as thin and sick as they did in the beginning . Then I woke up .
ERV	Genesis	41	22	“ In my next dream I saw seven heads of grain growing on one plant . They were healthy and full of grain .
ERV	Genesis	41	23	And then seven more heads of grain grew after them , but they were thin and scorched by the hot wind .
ERV	Genesis	41	24	Then the thin heads of grain ate the seven good heads of grain . “ I told these dreams to my magicians . But no one could explain the dreams to me . What do they mean ? ” Joseph Explains the Dream
ERV	Genesis	41	25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh , “ Both of these dreams have the same meaning . God is telling you what will happen soon .
ERV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows and the seven good heads of grain are seven good years .
ERV	Genesis	41	27	And the seven thin , sick-looking cows and the seven thin heads of grain mean that there will be seven years of hunger in this area . These seven bad years will come after the seven good years .
ERV	Genesis	41	28	God has shown you what will happen soon . He will make these things happen just as I told you .
ERV	Genesis	41	29	For seven years there will be plenty of food in Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	41	30	years old when he began serving the king of Egypt . He traveled throughout the country of Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	41	31	It will be so bad that people will forget what it was like to have plenty of food .
ERV	Genesis	41	32	“ Pharaoh , you had two dreams about the same thing . That means God wanted to show you that he really will make this happen , and he will make it happen soon !
ERV	Genesis	41	33	So , Pharaoh , you should choose a wise , intelligent man and put him in charge of Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	41	34	Then you should choose other men to collect food from the people . During the seven good years , the people must give them one-fifth of all the food they grow .
ERV	Genesis	41	35	In this way these men will collect all the food during the seven good years and store it in the cities until it is needed . Pharaoh , this food will be under your control .
ERV	Genesis	41	36	Then during the seven years of hunger , there will be food for the country of Egypt . And Egypt will not be destroyed by the famine. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	37	This seemed like a very good idea to Pharaoh , and all his officials agreed .
ERV	Genesis	41	38	Then Pharaoh told them , “ I don ’ t think we can find anyone better than Joseph to take this job ! God ’ s Spirit is in him , making him very wise ! ”
ERV	Genesis	41	39	So Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ God showed these things to you , so you must be the wisest man .
ERV	Genesis	41	40	I will put you in charge of my country , and the people will obey all your commands . I will be the only one more powerful than you. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	42	Then Pharaoh gave his special ring to Joseph . The royal seal was on this ring . Pharaoh also gave Joseph a fine linen robe and put a gold chain around his neck .
ERV	Genesis	41	43	Then he told Joseph to ride in his second chariot . Pharaoh ’ s officials said , “ Let him be the governor over the whole land of Egypt ! ” [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	41	44	Then Pharaoh said to him , “ I am Pharaoh , the king over everyone in Egypt , but no one else in Egypt can lift a hand or move a foot unless you say he can. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	45	Then Pharaoh gave Joseph another name , Zaphenath Paneah . [ b ] He also gave Joseph a wife named Asenath . She was the daughter of Potiphera , a priest in the city of On . So Joseph became the governor over the whole country of Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was
ERV	Genesis	41	47	During the seven good years , the crops in Egypt grew very well .
ERV	Genesis	41	48	Joseph saved the food in Egypt during those seven years and stored the food in the cities . In every city he stored grain that grew in the fields around the city .
ERV	Genesis	41	49	Joseph stored so much grain that it was like the sands of the sea . He stored so much grain that it could not be measured .
ERV	Genesis	41	50	Joseph ’ s wife , Asenath , was the daughter of Potiphera , the priest in the city of On . Before the first year of hunger came , Joseph and Asenath had two sons .
ERV	Genesis	41	51	Joseph named the first son Manasseh . [ c ] He was given this name because Joseph said , “ God made me forget all my hard work and everything back home in my father ’ s house. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	52	Joseph named the second son Ephraim . [ d ] Joseph gave him this name because he said , “ I had great troubles , but God has made me successful in everything. ” The Famine Begins
ERV	Genesis	41	53	For seven years people had all the food they needed , but those years ended .
ERV	Genesis	41	54	Then the seven years of hunger began , just as Joseph had said . No food grew anywhere in any of the countries in that area . But in Egypt people had plenty to eat because Joseph had stored the grain .
ERV	Genesis	41	55	The famine began , and the people cried to Pharaoh for food . Pharaoh said to the Egyptian people , “ Go ask Joseph what to do. ”
ERV	Genesis	41	56	There was famine everywhere , so Joseph gave the people grain from the warehouses . He sold the stored grain to the people of Egypt . The famine was bad in Egypt ,
ERV	Genesis	41	57	but the famine was bad everywhere . So people from the countries around Egypt had to come to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain . Footnotes - Genesis 41:43 Or “ Then Pharaoh had Joseph ride in the chariot of his second-in-command , and they said , ‘ Bow before Joseph. ’ In this way Joseph became the governor over all of Egypt. ” - Genesis 41:45 Zaphenath Paneah This Egyptian name probably means “ sustainer of life , ” but it is like Hebrew words meaning “ a person who explains secret things. ” - Genesis 41:51 Manasseh This is like the Hebrew word meaning “ to forget. ” - Genesis 41:52 Ephraim This name is like the Hebrew word meaning “ twice fruitful . ”
ERV	Genesis	42	42	During the famine in Canaan , Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt . So he said to his sons , “ Why are you sitting here doing nothing ?
ERV	Genesis	42	2	I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt . Go there and buy grain for us so that we will live and not die ! ”
ERV	Genesis	42	3	So ten of Joseph ’ s brothers went to Egypt to buy grain .
ERV	Genesis	42	4	Jacob did not send Benjamin . ( Benjamin was Joseph ’ s only full brother . [ a ] ) Jacob was afraid that something bad might happen to Benjamin .
ERV	Genesis	42	5	The famine was very bad in Canaan , so there were many people from Canaan who went to Egypt to buy grain . Among them were the sons of Israel .
ERV	Genesis	42	6	Joseph was the governor of Egypt at the time . He was the one who checked the sale of grain to people who came to Egypt to buy it . Joseph ’ s brothers came to him and bowed before him .
ERV	Genesis	42	7	Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them , but he acted like he didn ’ t know them . He was rude when he spoke to them . He said , “ Where do you come from ? ” The brothers answered , “ We have come from the land of Canaan to buy food. ”
ERV	Genesis	42	8	Joseph recognized his brothers , but they did not know who he was .
ERV	Genesis	42	9	Then Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about his brothers . Joseph said to his brothers , “ You have not come to buy food ! You are spies . You came to learn where we are weak. ”
ERV	Genesis	42	10	But the brothers said to him , “ No , sir , we come as your servants . We have come only to buy food .
ERV	Genesis	42	11	We are all brothers—we all have the same father . We are honest men . We have come only to buy food. ”
ERV	Genesis	42	12	Then Joseph said to them , “ No , you have come to spy on us ! ”
ERV	Genesis	42	13	And the brothers said , “ No , sir , we come as servants from Canaan . We are all brothers , sons of the same father . There were twelve brothers in our family . Our youngest brother is still at home with our father , and the other brother died a long time ago. ”
ERV	Genesis	42	14	But Joseph said to them , “ No ! I can see that I am right . You are spies .
ERV	Genesis	42	15	But I will let you prove that you are telling the truth . In the name of Pharaoh , I swear that I will not let you go until your youngest brother comes here .
ERV	Genesis	42	16	One of you must go back to get your youngest brother while the rest of you stay here in prison . Then we can prove whether you are telling the truth or not . If you are not telling the truth , then by Pharaoh , I swear that you are spies ! ”
ERV	Genesis	42	17	Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days . The Troubles Begin
ERV	Genesis	42	18	After three days Joseph said to them , “ I am a God-fearing man . Do this , and I will let you live .
ERV	Genesis	42	19	If you are honest men , one of your brothers can stay here in prison , and the others can go and carry grain back to your people .
ERV	Genesis	42	20	But then you must bring your youngest brother back here to me . Then I will know that you are telling the truth , and you will not have to die. ” The brothers agreed to this .
ERV	Genesis	42	21	They said to each other , “ We are being punished for the bad thing we did to our younger brother Joseph . We saw the trouble he was in . He begged us to save him , but we refused to listen . So now we are in trouble. ”
ERV	Genesis	42	22	Then Reuben said to them , “ I told you not to do anything bad to that boy , but you refused to listen to me . Now we are being punished for his death. ” 23-24 Joseph was using an interpreter to talk to his brothers , so the brothers did not know that he understood their language . He heard and understood everything they said , and that made him want to cry . So he turned away and left the room . When he came back , he took one of the brothers , Simeon , and tied him up while the others watched .
ERV	Genesis	42	25	Joseph told the servants to fill the bags with grain . The brothers had given Joseph the money for the grain , but he didn ’ t keep the money . He put the money in their bags of grain . Then he gave them what they would need for their trip back home .
ERV	Genesis	42	26	So the brothers put the grain on their donkeys and left .
ERV	Genesis	42	27	That night the brothers stopped at a place to spend the night . One of the brothers opened his sack to get some grain for his donkey . And there in the sack , he saw his money !
ERV	Genesis	42	28	He said to the other brothers , “ Look ! Here is the money I paid for the grain . Someone put the money back in my sack. ” The brothers were very afraid . They said to one another , “ What is God doing to us ? ” The Brothers Report to Jacob
ERV	Genesis	42	29	The brothers went back to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan . They told him about everything that had happened .
ERV	Genesis	42	30	They said , “ The governor of that country spoke rudely to us . He thought that we were spies !
ERV	Genesis	42	31	We told him , ‘ We are honest men , not spies .
ERV	Genesis	42	32	There are twelve of us brothers , all from the same father . But one of our brothers is no longer living , and the youngest is still at home with our father in Canaan. ’
ERV	Genesis	42	33	“ Then the governor of that country said to us , ‘ Here is a way to prove that you are honest men : Leave one of your brothers here with me . Take your grain back to your families .
ERV	Genesis	42	34	Bring your youngest brother to me . Then I will know if you are honest men or if you were sent from an army to destroy us . If you are telling the truth , I will give your brother back to you . I will give him to you , and you will be free to buy grain in our country. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	42	35	Then the brothers started taking the grain out of their sacks , and every brother found his bag of money in his sack of grain . When the brothers and their father saw the money , they were afraid .
ERV	Genesis	42	36	Jacob said to them , “ Do you want me to lose all of my children ? Joseph is gone . Simeon is gone , and now you want to take Benjamin away too ! ”
ERV	Genesis	42	37	But Reuben said to his father , “ Father , you may kill my two sons if I don ’ t bring Benjamin back to you . Trust me . I will bring him back to you. ”
ERV	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob said , “ I will not let Benjamin go with you . His brother is dead , and he is the only son left from my wife Rachel . It would kill me if anything happened to him during the trip to Egypt . You would send me to the grave [ b ] a very sad , old man. ” Footnotes - Genesis 42:4 full brother Literally , “ brother. ” Joseph and Benjamin had the same mother . - Genesis 42:38 grave Or “ Sheol , ” the place of death .
ERV	Genesis	43	43	The famine was very bad in that country .
ERV	Genesis	43	2	The people ate all the grain they had brought from Egypt . When that grain was gone , Jacob said to his sons , “ Go to Egypt and buy some more grain for us to eat. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	3	But Judah said to Jacob , “ But the governor of that country warned us . He said , ‘ If you don ’ t bring your brother back to me , I will refuse to talk to you. ’
ERV	Genesis	43	4	If you send Benjamin with us , we will go down and buy grain .
ERV	Genesis	43	5	But if you refuse to send Benjamin , we will not go . The man warned us to not come back without him. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	6	Israel said , “ Why did you tell him you had another brother ? Why did you do such a bad thing to me ? ”
ERV	Genesis	43	7	The brothers answered , “ He asked lots of questions . He wanted to know all about us and about our family . He asked us , ‘ Is your father still alive ? Do you have another brother at home ? ’ We only answered his questions . We didn ’ t know he would ask us to bring our brother to him ! ”
ERV	Genesis	43	8	Then Judah said to his father Israel , “ Let Benjamin go with me . I will take care of him . We have to go to Egypt to get food . If we don ’ t go , we will all die—including our children .
ERV	Genesis	43	9	I will make sure he is safe . I will be responsible for him . If I don ’ t bring him back to you , you can blame me forever .
ERV	Genesis	43	10	If you had let us go before , we could have already made two trips for food. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	11	Then their father Israel said , “ If it is really true , take Benjamin with you . But take some gifts to the governor . Take some of the things we have been able to gather in our land . Take him some honey , pistachio nuts , almonds , spices , and myrrh .
ERV	Genesis	43	12	Take twice as much money with you this time . Take the money that was given back to you after you paid last time . Maybe the governor made a mistake .
ERV	Genesis	43	13	Take Benjamin , and go back to the man .
ERV	Genesis	43	14	I pray that God All-Powerful will help you when you stand before the governor . I pray that he will let Benjamin , and also Simeon , come back safely . If not , I will again be sad from losing my children. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	15	So the brothers took the gifts to give to the governor . And the brothers took twice as much money with them as they took the first time . This time Benjamin went with the brothers to Egypt . The Brothers at Joseph ’ s House
ERV	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he said to his servant , “ Bring these men into my house . Kill an animal and cook it . They will eat with me at noon today. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	17	The servant did as he was told . He brought the men into Joseph ’ s house .
ERV	Genesis	43	18	The brothers were afraid when they were taken to Joseph ’ s house and said , “ We have been brought here because of the money that was put back in our sacks the last time . They will use this as proof against us and steal our donkeys and make us slaves. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	19	So the brothers went to the servant in charge of Joseph ’ s house .
ERV	Genesis	43	20	They said , “ Sir , I promise this is the truth . The last time we came , we came to buy food . 21-22 On the way home , we opened our sacks and found our money in every sack . We don ’ t know how it got there , but we brought that money with us to give it back to you . And we have brought more money to pay for the food that we want to buy this time. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	23	But the servant answered , “ Don ’ t be afraid ; believe me . Your God , the God of your father , must have put the money in your sack as a gift . I remember that you paid me for the grain the last time. ” Then the servant brought Simeon out of the prison .
ERV	Genesis	43	24	The servant led the men into Joseph ’ s house . He gave them water , and they washed their feet . Then he fed their donkeys .
ERV	Genesis	43	25	The brothers heard that they were going to eat with Joseph , so they worked until noon preparing their gifts for him .
ERV	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , the brothers gave him the gifts they had brought with them . Then they bowed down to the ground in front of him .
ERV	Genesis	43	27	Joseph asked them how they were doing . Then he said , “ How is your elderly father you told me about ? Is he still alive ? ”
ERV	Genesis	43	28	The brothers answered , “ Yes , sir , our father is still alive. ” And they again bowed before Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	43	29	Then Joseph saw his brother Benjamin . ( Benjamin and Joseph had the same mother . ) Joseph said , “ Is this your youngest brother that you told me about ? ” Then Joseph said to Benjamin , “ God bless you , my son ! ”
ERV	Genesis	43	30	Joseph felt a strong desire to show his brother Benjamin that he loved him . He was about to cry and didn ’ t want his brothers to see him , so he ran into his private room and cried there .
ERV	Genesis	43	31	Then Joseph washed his face and came out . He regained control of himself and said , “ Now it is time to eat. ”
ERV	Genesis	43	32	The servants seated Joseph at a table by himself . His brothers were at another table by themselves , and the Egyptians were at a table by themselves . The Egyptians believed that it was wrong for them to eat with Hebrews . [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	43	33	Joseph ’ s brothers were seated at a table facing him . The brothers were looking at each other because , to their surprise , they had been seated in order , from the oldest to the youngest .
ERV	Genesis	43	34	Servants were taking food from Joseph ’ s table and bringing it to them . But the servants gave Benjamin five times more than the others . The brothers continued to eat and drink with Joseph until they were drunk . Footnotes - Genesis 43:32 The Egyptians … Hebrews The Egyptians would not eat with them because they were shepherds and ate meat from cattle , sheep , and goats . To the Egyptians , these animals represented some of their gods . See Gen. 46:34 .
ERV	Genesis	44	44	Then Joseph gave a command to his servant . He said , “ Fill the men ’ s sacks with as much grain as they can carry . Then put each man ’ s money into his sack with the grain .
ERV	Genesis	44	2	Put the youngest brother ’ s money in his sack too . But also put my special silver cup in his sack. ” So the servant obeyed Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	44	3	Early the next morning the brothers and their donkeys were sent back to their country .
ERV	Genesis	44	4	After they had left the city , Joseph said to his servant , “ Go and follow the men . Stop them and say to them , ‘ We were good to you ! So why have you been bad to us ? Why did you steal my master ’ s silver cup ? [ a ]
ERV	Genesis	44	5	My master drinks from that cup , and he uses it to learn secret things . What you did was wrong ! ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	44	6	So the servant obeyed . He rode out to the brothers and stopped them . The servant said to them what Joseph had told him to say .
ERV	Genesis	44	7	But the brothers said to the servant , “ Why does the governor say these things ? We wouldn ’ t do anything like that !
ERV	Genesis	44	8	We brought back the money that we found in our sacks before . So surely we wouldn ’ t steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house .
ERV	Genesis	44	9	If you find the silver cup in any of our sacks , let that man die . You can kill him , and we will be your slaves. ”
ERV	Genesis	44	10	The servant said , “ I agree , except that only the man who is found to have the cup will be my slave . The others will be free. ” The Trap Is Sprung ; Benjamin Is Caught
ERV	Genesis	44	11	Then every brother quickly opened his sack on the ground .
ERV	Genesis	44	12	The servant started looking in the sacks . He started with the oldest brother and ended with the youngest . He found the cup in Benjamin ’ s sack .
ERV	Genesis	44	13	The brothers were very sad . They tore their clothes to show their sadness . They put their sacks back on the donkeys and went back to the city .
ERV	Genesis	44	14	When Judah and his brothers went back to Joseph ’ s house , Joseph was still there . The brothers fell to the ground and bowed down before him .
ERV	Genesis	44	15	Joseph said to them , “ Why have you done this ? Didn ’ t you know that I have a special way of learning secrets ? No one is better at this than I am ! ”
ERV	Genesis	44	16	Judah said , “ Sir , there is nothing we can say . There is no way to explain . There is no way to show that we are not guilty . God has judged us guilty for something else we have done . So all of us , even Benjamin , will be your slaves. ”
ERV	Genesis	44	17	But Joseph said , “ I will not make you all slaves ! Only the man who stole the cup will be my slave . You others can go in peace to your father. ” Judah Pleads for Benjamin
ERV	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah went to Joseph and said , “ Sir , please let me speak plainly with you . Please don ’ t be angry with me . I know that you are like Pharaoh himself .
ERV	Genesis	44	19	When we were here before , you asked us , ‘ Do you have a father or a brother ? ’
ERV	Genesis	44	20	And we answered you , ‘ We have a father—he is an old man . And we have a younger brother . Our father loves him because he was born while our father was old . This youngest son ’ s brother is dead , so he is the only son who is left from that mother . Our father loves him very much. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	21	Then you said to us , ‘ Bring that brother to me . I want to see him. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	22	And we said to you , ‘ That young boy can not come . He can not leave his father . If his father loses him , his father will be so sad that he will die. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	23	But you said to us , ‘ You must bring your youngest brother , or I will not sell you grain again. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	24	So we went back to our father and told him what you said .
ERV	Genesis	44	25	“ Later , our father said , ‘ Go back and buy us some more food. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	26	We said to our father , ‘ We can not go without our youngest brother . The governor said he will not sell us grain again until he sees our youngest brother. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	27	Then my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife Rachel gave me two sons .
ERV	Genesis	44	28	I let one son go away , and he was killed by a wild animal . And I haven ’ t seen him since .
ERV	Genesis	44	29	If you take my other son away from me , and something happens to him , I will be sad enough to die. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	30	Now , imagine what will happen when we go home without our youngest brother—he is the most important thing in our father ’ s life !
ERV	Genesis	44	31	Our father will die if he sees that the boy isn ’ t with us—and it will be our fault . We will send our father to his grave a very sad man .
ERV	Genesis	44	32	“ I took responsibility for the young boy . I told my father , ‘ If I don ’ t bring him back to you , you can blame me for the rest of my life. ’
ERV	Genesis	44	33	So now I beg you , please let the boy go back with his brothers , and I will stay and be your slave .
ERV	Genesis	44	34	I can not go back to my father if the boy is not with me . I am very afraid of what would happen to my father. ” Footnotes - Genesis 44:4 Why did … silver cup This is from the ancient Greek version .
ERV	Genesis	45	45	Joseph could not control himself any longer . He cried in front of all the people who were there . Joseph said , “ Tell everyone to leave here. ” So all the people left . Only the brothers were left with Joseph . Then he told them who he was .
ERV	Genesis	45	2	Joseph continued to cry , and all the Egyptian people in Pharaoh ’ s house heard it .
ERV	Genesis	45	3	He said to his brothers , “ I am your brother Joseph . Is my father doing well ? ” But the brothers did not answer him because they were confused and afraid .
ERV	Genesis	45	4	So Joseph said to his brothers again , “ Come here to me . I beg you , come here. ” When the brothers went to him , he said to them , “ I am your brother Joseph . I am the one you sold as a slave to Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	45	5	Now don ’ t be worried . Don ’ t be angry with yourselves for what you did . It was God ’ s plan for me to come here . I am here to save people ’ s lives .
ERV	Genesis	45	6	This terrible famine has continued for two years now , and there will be five more years without planting or harvest .
ERV	Genesis	45	7	So God sent me here ahead of you so that I can save your people in this country .
ERV	Genesis	45	8	It was not your fault that I was sent here . It was God ’ s plan . God made me like a father to Pharaoh . I am the governor over all his house and over all Egypt. ” Israel Invited to Egypt
ERV	Genesis	45	9	Joseph said , “ Hurry up and go to my father . Tell him his son Joseph sent this message : ‘ God made me the governor of Egypt . So come here to me quickly . Don ’ t wait .
ERV	Genesis	45	10	You can live near me in the land of Goshen . You , your children , your grandchildren , and all of your animals are welcome here .
ERV	Genesis	45	11	I will take care of you during the next five years of hunger . So you and your family will not lose everything you own. ’
ERV	Genesis	45	12	“ Surely you can see that I really am Joseph . Even my brother Benjamin knows it is me , your brother , talking to you .
ERV	Genesis	45	13	So tell my father about the honor I have received here in Egypt . Tell him about everything you have seen here . Now hurry , go bring my father back to me. ”
ERV	Genesis	45	14	Then Joseph hugged his brother Benjamin , and they both began crying .
ERV	Genesis	45	15	Then Joseph cried as he kissed all his brothers . After this , the brothers began talking with him .
ERV	Genesis	45	16	Pharaoh learned that Joseph ’ s brothers had come to him . This news spread throughout Pharaoh ’ s house . Pharaoh and his servants were very excited !
ERV	Genesis	45	17	So Pharaoh told Joseph , “ Tell your brothers to take all the food they need and go back to the land of Canaan .
ERV	Genesis	45	18	Tell them to bring your father and their families back here to me . I will give you the best land in Egypt to live on . And your family can eat the best food we have here .
ERV	Genesis	45	19	Also give your brothers some of our best wagons . Tell them to go to Canaan and bring your father and all the women and children back in the wagons .
ERV	Genesis	45	20	Don ’ t worry about bringing all of their belongings . We can give them the best of Egypt. ”
ERV	Genesis	45	21	So the sons of Israel did this . Joseph gave them good wagons just as Pharaoh had promised . And Joseph gave them enough food for their trip .
ERV	Genesis	45	22	He gave each brother a suit of beautiful clothes . But to Benjamin he gave five suits of beautiful clothes and
ERV	Genesis	45	300	pieces of silver .
ERV	Genesis	45	23	Joseph also sent gifts to his father . He sent ten donkeys with bags full of many good things from Egypt . And he sent ten female donkeys loaded with grain , bread , and other food for his father on his trip back .
ERV	Genesis	45	24	Then Joseph told his brothers to go . While they were leaving , he said to them , “ Go straight home , and don ’ t fight on the way. ”
ERV	Genesis	45	25	So the brothers left Egypt and went to their father in the land of Canaan .
ERV	Genesis	45	26	They told him , “ Father , Joseph is still alive ! And he is the governor over the whole country of Egypt. ” Their father did not know what to think . At first he didn ’ t believe them .
ERV	Genesis	45	27	But then they told him everything Joseph had said . Then their father saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to bring him back to Egypt , and he became excited and very happy .
ERV	Genesis	45	28	Israel said , “ Now I believe you . My son Joseph is still alive ! I am going to see him before I die ! ”
ERV	Genesis	46	46	So Israel began his trip to Egypt . First he went to Beersheba . There he worshiped God , the God of his father Isaac . He offered sacrifices .
ERV	Genesis	46	2	During the night God spoke to Israel in a dream and said , “ Jacob , Jacob. ” Israel answered , “ Here I am. ”
ERV	Genesis	46	3	Then God said , “ I am God , the God of your father . Don ’ t be afraid to go to Egypt . In Egypt I will make you a great nation .
ERV	Genesis	46	4	I will go to Egypt with you , and I will bring you out of Egypt again . You will die there , but Joseph will be with you . His own hands will close your eyes when you die. ” Israel Goes to Egypt
ERV	Genesis	46	5	Then Jacob left Beersheba and traveled to Egypt . His sons , the sons of Israel , brought their father , their wives , and all their children to Egypt . They traveled in the wagons the Pharaoh had sent .
ERV	Genesis	46	6	They also had their cattle and everything they owned in the land of Canaan . So Israel went to Egypt with all his children and his family .
ERV	Genesis	46	7	With him were his sons and his grandsons , his daughters and his granddaughters . All of his family went with him . The Family of Jacob ( Israel )
ERV	Genesis	46	8	These are the names of Israel ’ s sons and family who went to Egypt with him : Reuben was Jacob ’ s first son .

ERV	Genesis	46	33	When Pharaoh calls you , he will ask , ‘ What work do you do ? ’
ERV	Genesis	46	16	people in this family .
ERV	Genesis	46	17	Asher ’ s sons were Imnah , Ishvah , Ishvi , Beriah , and their sister Serah . Also there were Beriah ’ s sons , Heber and Malkiel .
ERV	Genesis	46	18	All these were Jacob ’ s sons from his wife ’ s servant , Zilpah . ( Zilpah was the maid that Laban had given to his daughter Leah . ) There were
ERV	Genesis	46	19	Benjamin was also with Jacob . Benjamin was Jacob and Rachel ’ s son . ( Joseph was also Rachel ’ s son , but he was already in Egypt . )
ERV	Genesis	46	20	In Egypt , Joseph had two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim . ( Joseph ’ s wife was Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera , the priest in the city of On . )
ERV	Genesis	46	21	Benjamin ’ s sons were Bela , Beker , Ashbel , Gera , Naaman , Ehi , Rosh , Muppim , Huppim , and Ard .

ERV	Genesis	46	26	The total number of Jacob ’ s direct descendants who went with him to Egypt was
ERV	Genesis	46	66	people . ( The wives of Jacob ’ s sons were not counted in this number . )
ERV	Genesis	46	27	Also , Joseph had two sons in Egypt . With these two grandsons , Jacob ’ s family in Egypt numbered
ERV	Genesis	46	70	people in all . Israel Arrives in Egypt
ERV	Genesis	46	28	Jacob sent Judah ahead to speak to Joseph . Judah went to Joseph in the land of Goshen . Then Jacob and his people followed into the land .
ERV	Genesis	46	29	Joseph learned that his father was coming . So he prepared his chariot and went out to meet his father , Israel , in Goshen . When Joseph saw his father , he hugged his neck and cried for a long time .
ERV	Genesis	46	30	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Now I can die in peace . I have seen your face , and I know that you are still alive. ”
ERV	Genesis	46	31	Joseph said to his brothers and to the rest of his father ’ s family , “ I will go and tell Pharaoh that you are here . I will say to Pharaoh , ‘ My brothers and the rest of my father ’ s family have left the land of Canaan and have come here to me .
ERV	Genesis	46	32	They are a family of shepherds . They have always kept sheep and cattle . They have brought all their animals and everything they own with them. ’
ERV	Genesis	46	34	You tell him , ‘ We are shepherds . All our lives we have been shepherds , and our ancestors were shepherds before us. ’ Then Pharaoh will allow you to live in the land of Goshen . Egyptians don ’ t like shepherds , so it is better that you stay in Goshen . ”
ERV	Genesis	47	47	Joseph went in to Pharaoh and said , “ My father and my brothers and all their families are here . They have all their animals and everything they own from the land of Canaan with them . They are now in the land of Goshen. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	2	Joseph chose five of his brothers to be with him before the Pharaoh .
ERV	Genesis	47	3	Pharaoh said to the brothers , “ What work do you do ? ” The brothers said to Pharaoh , “ Sir , we are shepherds , just as our ancestors were shepherds before us. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	4	They said to Pharaoh , “ The famine is very bad in Canaan . There are no fields left with grass for our animals , so we have come to live in this land . We ask you to please let us live in Goshen. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Your father and your brothers have come to you .
ERV	Genesis	47	6	You can choose any place in Egypt for them to live . Give your father and your brothers the best land . Let them live in the land of Goshen . And if they are skilled shepherds , they can also care for my cattle. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph called his father Jacob to come in to meet Pharaoh . Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
ERV	Genesis	47	8	Then Pharaoh said to him , “ How old are you ? ”
ERV	Genesis	47	9	Jacob said to Pharaoh , “ I have had a short life with many troubles . I am only
ERV	Genesis	47	130	years old . My father and his ancestors lived to be much older than I am. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	10	Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left from his meeting with him .
ERV	Genesis	47	11	Joseph did what Pharaoh said and gave his father and brothers land in Egypt . It was the best land in Egypt , in the eastern part of the country , around Rameses .
ERV	Genesis	47	12	Joseph also gave his father , his brothers , and all their people the food they needed . Joseph Buys Land for Pharaoh
ERV	Genesis	47	13	The famine got worse ; there was no food anywhere in the land . Egypt and Canaan became very poor because of this bad time .
ERV	Genesis	47	14	People in the land bought more and more grain . Joseph saved the money and brought it to Pharaoh ’ s house .
ERV	Genesis	47	15	After some time , the people in Egypt and Canaan had no money left . They had spent all their money to buy grain . So the people of Egypt went to Joseph and said , “ Please give us food . Our money is gone . If we don ’ t eat , we will die while you are watching. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	16	But Joseph answered , “ Give me your cattle , and I will give you food. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	17	years , so he was
ERV	Genesis	47	18	But the next year the people had no animals and nothing to buy food with . So they went to Joseph and said , “ You know that we have no money left , and all our animals belong to you . So we have nothing left—only what you see—our bodies and our land .
ERV	Genesis	47	19	Surely we will die while you are watching . But if you give us food , we will give Pharaoh our land , and we will be his slaves . Give us seed so that we can plant . Then we will live and not die , and the land will grow food for us again. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh . All the people in Egypt sold Joseph their fields . They did this because they were very hungry .
ERV	Genesis	47	21	And everywhere in Egypt all the people became Pharaoh ’ s slaves .
ERV	Genesis	47	22	The only land Joseph didn ’ t buy was the land that the priests owned . The priests didn ’ t need to sell their land because Pharaoh paid them for their work . So they used this money to buy food to eat .
ERV	Genesis	47	23	Joseph said to the people , “ Now I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh . So I will give you seed , and you can plant your fields .
ERV	Genesis	47	24	At harvest time , you must give one-fifth of your crops to Pharaoh . You can keep four-fifths for yourselves . You can use the seed you keep for food and planting the next year . Now you can feed your families and your children. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	25	The people said , “ You have saved our lives . We are happy to be slaves to Pharaoh. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph made a law at that time in the land , and that law continues today . The law says that one-fifth of everything from the land belongs to the Pharaoh who owns all the land . The only land he does not own is the land of the priests . Don ’ t Bury Me in Egypt
ERV	Genesis	47	27	Israel stayed in Egypt . He lived in the land of Goshen . His family grew and became very large . They became landowners there and did very well .
ERV	Genesis	47	28	Jacob lived in Egypt
ERV	Genesis	47	147	years old .
ERV	Genesis	47	29	The time came when Israel knew he would soon die , so he called his son Joseph to him . He said , “ If you love me , put your hand under my leg and make a promise . [ a ] Promise that you will do what I say and that you will be truthful with me . When I die , don ’ t bury me in Egypt .
ERV	Genesis	47	30	Bury me in the place where my ancestors are buried . Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in our family grave. ” Joseph answered , “ I promise that I will do what you say. ”
ERV	Genesis	47	31	Then Jacob said , “ Make a vow to me. ” And Joseph vowed to him that he would do this . Then Israel laid his head back down on the bed . [ b ] Footnotes - Genesis 47:29 put your hand … make a promise This was a sign of a very important promise that Jacob trusted Joseph to keep . - Genesis 47:31 Then Israel … on the bed Or “ Then Israel bowed down at the head of his bed ” or “ Then Israel worshiped on the head of the staff . ”
ERV	Genesis	48	48	Some time later Joseph learned that his father was very sick . So he took his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim , and went to his father .
ERV	Genesis	48	2	When Joseph arrived , someone told Israel , “ Your son Joseph has come to see you. ” Israel was very weak , but he tried hard and sat up in his bed .
ERV	Genesis	48	3	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ God All-Powerful appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan . God blessed me there .
ERV	Genesis	48	4	He said to me , ‘ I will make you a great family . I will give you many children and you will be a great people . Your family will own this land forever. ’
ERV	Genesis	48	5	Now you have two sons . These two sons were born here in the country of Egypt before I came . Your two sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , will be like my own sons . They will be like Reuben and Simeon to me .
ERV	Genesis	48	6	So these two boys will be my sons . They will share in everything I own . But if you have other sons , they will be your sons . But they will also be like sons to Ephraim and Manasseh—that is , in the future , they will share in everything that Ephraim and Manasseh own .
ERV	Genesis	48	7	On the trip from Paddan Aram , Rachel died in the land of Canaan . This made me very sad . We were still traveling toward Ephrath . I buried her there on the road to Ephrath. ” ( Ephrath is Bethlehem . )
ERV	Genesis	48	8	Then Israel saw Joseph ’ s sons . Israel said , “ Who are these boys ? ”
ERV	Genesis	48	9	Joseph said to his father , “ These are my sons . These are the boys God gave me. ” Israel said , “ Bring your sons to me . I will bless them. ”
ERV	Genesis	48	10	Israel was old and his eyes were not good . So Joseph brought the boys close to his father . Israel kissed and hugged the boys .
ERV	Genesis	48	11	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ I never thought I would see your face again . But look ! God has let me see you and your children. ”
ERV	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph took the boys off Israel ’ s lap , and they bowed down in front of his father .
ERV	Genesis	48	13	Joseph put Ephraim on his right side and Manasseh on his left side . ( So Ephraim was on Israel ’ s left side , and Manasseh was on Israel ’ s right side . )
ERV	Genesis	48	14	But Israel crossed his hands and put his right hand on the head of the younger boy Ephraim . Then he put his left hand on Manasseh , even though Manasseh was the firstborn .
ERV	Genesis	48	15	And Israel blessed Joseph and said , “ My ancestors , Abraham and Isaac , worshiped our God , and that God has led me all my life .
ERV	Genesis	48	16	He was the Angel who saved me from all my troubles . And I pray that he will bless these boys . Now they will have my name and the name of our ancestors , Abraham and Isaac . I pray that they will grow to become great families and nations on earth. ”
ERV	Genesis	48	17	Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on Ephraim ’ s head . This didn ’ t make Joseph happy . Joseph took his father ’ s hand because he wanted to move it from Ephraim ’ s head and put it on Manasseh ’ s head .
ERV	Genesis	48	18	Joseph said to his father , “ You have your right hand on the wrong boy . Manasseh is the firstborn . Put your right hand on him. ”
ERV	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , “ I know , son . I know . Manasseh is the firstborn . He will be great and will be the father of many people . But his younger brother will be greater than he is . And the younger brother ’ s family will be much larger. ”
ERV	Genesis	48	20	So Israel blessed them that day . He said , “ The Israelites will use your names whenever they bless someone . They will say , ‘ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh. ’ ” In this way Israel made Ephraim greater than Manasseh .
ERV	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ Look , my time to die is almost here , but God will still be with you . He will lead you back to the land of your ancestors .
ERV	Genesis	48	22	I have given you one portion more than I gave to your brothers . I gave you the land that I won from the Amorites . I used my sword and bow to take that land . ”
ERV	Genesis	49	49	Then Jacob called all his sons to him . He said , “ My sons , come here to me . I will tell you what will happen in the future .
ERV	Genesis	49	2	“ Children of Jacob , gather around . Come listen to Israel , your father . Reuben
ERV	Genesis	49	3	“ Reuben , my first son , you are my strength , the first proof of my manhood . You were the most honored and powerful of all my sons .
ERV	Genesis	49	4	But your passion was like a flood you couldn ’ t control . So you will not remain my most honored son . You climbed into your father ’ s bed and slept with one of his wives . You brought shame to my bed , to the bed you lay on . Simeon and Levi
ERV	Genesis	49	5	“ Simeon and Levi are brothers . They are violent with their swords .
ERV	Genesis	49	6	I will not join their secret meetings . I will not take part in their evil plans . They have killed people out of anger and crippled animals for fun .
ERV	Genesis	49	7	Their anger is so strong that it is a curse . They are too cruel when they are angry . They will not get their own land in the land of Jacob . They will be spread throughout Israel . Judah
ERV	Genesis	49	8	“ Judah , your brothers will praise you . You will defeat your enemies . Your brothers will bow down to you .
ERV	Genesis	49	9	Judah is like a young lion . My son , you are like a lion standing over the animal it killed . Like a lion , Judah lies down to rest , and no one is brave enough to disturb him .
ERV	Genesis	49	10	The ruler ’ s scepter will not pass from between Judah ’ s feet before he gets what is his , that is , the people ’ s obedience .
ERV	Genesis	49	11	His young donkey will be tied to the very best grapevines . He will wash his finest clothes in wine , the blood of grapes .

ERV	Genesis	49	27	“ Benjamin is like a hungry wolf . In the morning he kills and eats . In the evening he shares what is left. ”
ERV	Genesis	49	28	These are the twelve families of Israel . And this is what their father said to them . He gave each son a blessing that was right for him .
ERV	Genesis	49	29	Then Israel gave them a command . He said , “ When I die , I want to be with my people . I want to be buried with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite .
ERV	Genesis	49	30	That cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre in the land of Canaan . Abraham bought that field from Ephron so that he could have a burying place .

ERV	Genesis	50	2	Joseph commanded his servants to prepare his father ’ s body . ( These servants were doctors . ) The doctors prepared Jacob ’ s body to be buried . They prepared the body in the special way of the Egyptians .
ERV	Genesis	50	3	When the Egyptians prepared the body in this special way , they waited
ERV	Genesis	50	40	days before they buried the body . Then the Egyptians had a special time of sadness for Jacob . This time was
ERV	Genesis	50	70	days .
ERV	Genesis	50	4	After the time of sadness was finished , Joseph spoke to Pharaoh ’ s officers and said , “ Please tell this to Pharaoh :
ERV	Genesis	50	5	‘ When my father was near death , I made a promise to him . I promised that I would bury him in a cave in the land of Canaan . This is the cave that he prepared for himself . So please let me go and bury my father . Then I will come back here to you. ’ ”
ERV	Genesis	50	6	Pharaoh answered , “ Keep your promise . Go and bury your father. ”
ERV	Genesis	50	7	So Joseph went to bury his father . All of Pharaoh ’ s officials , personal advisors , and all the older leaders of Egypt went with Joseph .
ERV	Genesis	50	8	All the people in Joseph ’ s family , his brothers , and all the people in his father ’ s family went with him . Only the children and the animals stayed in the land of Goshen .
ERV	Genesis	50	9	So there was a large crowd of people with him . There was even a group of soldiers riding in chariots and some on horses .
ERV	Genesis	50	10	They went to Goren Atad , [ a ] east of the Jordan River . There they had a long funeral service for Israel , which continued for seven days .
ERV	Genesis	50	11	When the people who lived in Canaan saw the funeral service at Goren Atad , they said , “ This is a time of great sorrow for those Egyptians. ” So now that place across the Jordan River is named Abel Mizraim . [ b ]
ERV	Genesis	50	12	So Jacob ’ s sons did what their father told them .
ERV	Genesis	50	13	They carried his body to Canaan and buried it in the cave at Machpelah . This was the cave near Mamre in the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite . Abraham bought that cave to use as a burial place .
ERV	Genesis	50	14	After Joseph buried his father , he and everyone in the group with him went back to Egypt . The Brothers Are Still Afraid of Joseph
ERV	Genesis	50	15	After Jacob died , Joseph ’ s brothers were worried . They were afraid that Joseph would still be mad at them for what they had done years before . They said , “ Maybe Joseph still hates us for what we did. ”
ERV	Genesis	50	16	So the brothers sent this message to Joseph : “ Before your father died , he told us to give you a message .
ERV	Genesis	50	17	He said , ‘ Tell Joseph that I beg him to please forgive his brothers for the bad things they did to him. ’ So now Joseph , we beg you , please forgive us for the bad things we did to you . We are the servants of God , the God of your father. ” That message made Joseph very sad , and he cried .
ERV	Genesis	50	18	His brothers went to him and bowed down in front of him . They said , “ We will be your servants. ”
ERV	Genesis	50	19	Then Joseph said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . I am not God ! I have no right to punish you .
ERV	Genesis	50	20	It is true that you planned to do something bad to me . But really , God was planning good things . God ’ s plan was to use me to save the lives of many people . And that is what happened .
ERV	Genesis	50	21	So don ’ t be afraid . I will take care of you and your children. ” And so Joseph said kind things to his brothers , and this made them feel better .
ERV	Genesis	50	22	Joseph continued to live in Egypt with his father ’ s family . He died when he was
ERV	Genesis	50	110	years old . Doctors prepared his body for burial and put the body in a coffin in Egypt . Footnotes - Genesis 50:10 Goren Atad Or “ Atad ’ s threshing floor. ” - Genesis 50:11 Abel Mizraim This means “ Egyptian time of sadness . ”

ERV	Genesis	50	25	Then Joseph asked his people to make a promise . Joseph said , “ Promise me that you will carry my bones with you when God leads you out of Egypt. ”

ERV	Exodus	1	7	But the Israelites had many children , and their number grew until the country of Egypt was filled with them . Trouble for the Israelites
ERV	Exodus	1	8	Then a new king began to rule Egypt . He did not know Joseph .
ERV	Exodus	1	9	This king said to his people , “ Look at the Israelites . There are too many of them , and they are stronger than we are !
ERV	Exodus	1	10	We must make plans to stop them from growing stronger . If there is a war , they might join our enemies , defeat us , and escape from the land ! ”
ERV	Exodus	1	11	The Egyptians decided to make life hard for the Israelites , so they put slave masters over the people . These masters forced the Israelites to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses for the king . The king used these cities to store grain and other things .
ERV	Exodus	1	12	The Egyptians forced the Israelites to work harder and harder . But the harder they worked , the more they grew and spread , and the more the Egyptians became afraid of them .
ERV	Exodus	1	13	So the Egyptians made them work even harder .
ERV	Exodus	1	14	They made life hard for the Israelites . They forced the Israelites to work hard at making bricks and mortar and to work hard in the fields . The Egyptians showed no mercy in all the hard work they made the Israelites do ! The Nurses Who Followed God
ERV	Exodus	1	15	There were two Hebrew [ a ] nurses who helped the Israelite women give birth . They were named Shiphrah and Puah . The king of Egypt said to the nurses ,
ERV	Exodus	1	16	“ You will continue to help the Hebrew women give birth to their children . If a girl baby is born , let the baby live . But if the baby is a boy , you must kill him ! ”
ERV	Exodus	1	17	But the nurses trusted [ b ] God , so they did not obey the king ’ s command . They let all the baby boys live .

ERV	Exodus	1	19	. - Exodus 1:17 trusted Literally , “ feared ” or “ respected. ” Also in verses 20-21 .

ERV	Exodus	2	5	Just then , Pharaoh ’ s daughter went to the river to bathe . She saw the basket in the tall grass . Her servants were walking beside the river , so she told one of them to go get the basket .
ERV	Exodus	2	6	The king ’ s daughter opened the basket and saw a baby boy . The baby was crying and she felt sorry for him . Then she noticed that it was one of the Hebrew [ b ] babies .
ERV	Exodus	2	7	,
ERV	Exodus	2	8	The king ’ s daughter said , “ Yes , please. ” So the girl went and brought the baby ’ s own mother .
ERV	Exodus	2	9	The king ’ s daughter said to the mother , “ Take this baby and feed him for me . I ’ ll pay you to take care of him. ” So the woman took her baby and cared for him .
ERV	Exodus	2	10	The baby grew , and after some time , the woman gave the baby to the king ’ s daughter . The king ’ s daughter accepted the baby as her own son . She named him Moses [ c ] because she had pulled him from the water . Moses Helps His People

ERV	Exodus	2	18	Then they went back to their father , Reuel . [ e ] He asked them , “ Why have you come home early today ? ”
ERV	Exodus	2	19	The girls answered , “ The shepherds chased us away , but an Egyptian rescued us . He got water for us and gave it to our animals. ”
ERV	Exodus	2	20	So Reuel said to his daughters , “ Where is this man ? Why did you leave him ? Go invite him to eat with us. ”
ERV	Exodus	2	21	Moses was happy to stay with that man . Reuel let Moses marry his daughter , Zipporah .
ERV	Exodus	2	22	Zipporah became pregnant and had a son . Moses named him Gershom [ f ] because Moses was a stranger in a land that was not his own . God Decides to Help Israel

ERV	Exodus	4	8	Then God said , “ If the people don ’ t believe you when you use your walking stick , then they will believe you when you show them this sign .
ERV	Exodus	4	9	If they still refuse to believe after you show them both of these signs , then take some water from the Nile River . Pour the water on the ground , and as soon as it touches the ground , it will become blood. ”
ERV	Exodus	4	10	Then Moses said to the Lord , “ But , Lord , I am telling you , I am not a good speaker . I have never been able to speak well . And that hasn ’ t changed since you started talking to me . I am still not a good speaker . You know that I speak slowly and don ’ t use the best words. ” [ b ]
ERV	Exodus	4	11	Then the Lord said to him , “ Who made a person ’ s mouth ? And who can make someone deaf or not able to speak ? Who can make a person blind ? Who can make a person able to see ? I am the one . I am the Lord .
ERV	Exodus	4	12	So go . I will be with you when you speak . I will give you the words to say. ”
ERV	Exodus	4	13	But Moses said , “ My Lord , I beg you to send someone else , not me. ”
ERV	Exodus	4	14	Then the Lord became angry with Moses and said , “ All right ! I ’ ll give you someone to help you . Aaron the Levite is your brother , isn ’ t he ? He is a good speaker . In fact , Aaron is already coming to meet you , and he will be happy to see you .
ERV	Exodus	4	15	I will tell you what to say . Then you will tell Aaron , and I will help him say it well . I will tell both of you what to do .
ERV	Exodus	4	16	So Aaron will speak for you . Like God , you will speak to him , and he will tell the people what you say .
ERV	Exodus	4	17	So go and carry your walking stick with you . Use it and the other miracles to show the people that I am with you. ” Moses Leaves Midian
ERV	Exodus	4	18	Then Moses went back to Jethro , his father-in-law . Moses said to him , “ Please let me go back to Egypt . I want to see if my people are still alive. ” Jethro said to Moses , “ Go in peace. ”
ERV	Exodus	4	19	Then , while Moses was still in Midian , the Lord said to him , “ It is safe for you to go back to Egypt now . The men who wanted to kill you are now dead. ”
ERV	Exodus	4	20	So Moses put his wife and children on the donkey and returned to Egypt . He carried his walking stick with him—the walking stick with the power of God .
ERV	Exodus	4	21	While Moses was traveling back to Egypt , the Lord spoke to him , “ When you talk to Pharaoh remember to show him all the miracles that I have given you the power to do . But I will cause Pharaoh to be very stubborn . He will not let the people go .
ERV	Exodus	4	22	Then you should say to Pharaoh , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Israel is my firstborn son .
ERV	Exodus	4	23	And I am telling you to let my son go and worship me . If you refuse to let Israel go , then I will kill your firstborn son. ’ ” Moses ’ Son Circumcised
ERV	Exodus	4	24	On the way to Egypt , Moses stopped at a place to spend the night . The Lord met Moses at that place and tried to kill him . [ c ]
ERV	Exodus	4	25	But Zipporah took a flint knife [ d ] and circumcised her son . She took the skin and touched his feet . Then she said to Moses , “ You are a bridegroom of blood to me. ”
ERV	Exodus	4	26	Zipporah said this because she had to circumcise her son . So God let Moses live . [ e ] Moses Arrives in Egypt
ERV	Exodus	4	27	The Lord had spoken to Aaron and told him , “ Go out into the desert and meet Moses. ” So Aaron went and met Moses at the Mountain of God . [ f ] He saw Moses and kissed him .
ERV	Exodus	4	28	Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had commanded him to say and all the miracles he must do to prove that God had sent him .
ERV	Exodus	4	29	So Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the Israelites .
ERV	Exodus	4	30	Then Aaron spoke to the people and told them everything the Lord had told Moses . Then Moses did the miracles for all the people to see ,
ERV	Exodus	4	31	and they believed what they had heard . Then the Israelites understood that the Lord had seen their troubles and had come to help them . So they bowed down and worshiped God .

ERV	Exodus	5	5	There are very many workers , and you are keeping them from doing their jobs. ” Pharaoh Punishes the People
ERV	Exodus	5	2	But Pharaoh said , “ Who is the Lord ? Why should I obey him ? Why should I let Israel go ? I don ’ t even know who this Lord is , so I refuse to let Israel go. ”
ERV	Exodus	5	3	Then Aaron and Moses said , “ The God of the Hebrews [ b ] has talked with us . So we beg you to let us travel three days into the desert . There we will offer a sacrifice to the Lord our God . If we don ’ t do this , he might become angry and destroy us . He might make us die from sickness or war. ”
ERV	Exodus	5	4	But Pharaoh said to them , “ Moses and Aaron , you are bothering the workers . Let them do their work . Go back to your own work !
ERV	Exodus	5	6	That same day Pharaoh gave a command to the slave masters and Hebrew foremen .
ERV	Exodus	5	7	He said , “ You have always given the people straw to use to make bricks . But now , tell them they have to go and find their own straw to make bricks .
ERV	Exodus	5	8	But they must still make the same number of bricks as they did before . They have gotten lazy . That is why they are asking me to let them go . They don ’ t have enough work to do . That is why they asked me to let them make sacrifices to their God .
ERV	Exodus	5	9	So make these people work harder . Keep them busy . Then they will not have enough time to listen to the lies of Moses. ”
ERV	Exodus	5	10	,
ERV	Exodus	5	11	You must go and get the straw for yourselves . So go and find straw , but you must still make as many bricks as you made before. ”
ERV	Exodus	5	12	So the people went everywhere in Egypt looking for straw .
ERV	Exodus	5	13	The slave masters forced the people to work even harder . They forced the people to make as many bricks as before .
ERV	Exodus	5	14	,
ERV	Exodus	5	15	,
ERV	Exodus	5	16	You give us no straw , but you tell us to make as many bricks as before . And now our masters are beating us . Your people are wrong for doing this. ”
ERV	Exodus	5	17	Pharaoh answered , “ You are lazy , and you don ’ t want to work ! That is why you ask me to let you go . And that is why you want to leave here and make sacrifices to the Lord .
ERV	Exodus	5	18	Now , go back to work ! We will not give you any straw . And you must still make as many bricks as you did before. ”
ERV	Exodus	5	19	.
ERV	Exodus	5	20	When they were leaving the meeting with Pharaoh , they passed Moses and Aaron . Moses and Aaron were waiting for them .
ERV	Exodus	5	21	So they said to Moses and Aaron , “ May the Lord judge and punish you for what you did ! You made Pharaoh and his rulers hate us . You have given them an excuse to kill us. ” Moses Complains to God
ERV	Exodus	5	22	Then Moses prayed to the Lord and said , “ Lord , why have you done this terrible thing to your people ? Why did you send me here ?
ERV	Exodus	5	23	I went to Pharaoh and said what you told me to say . But since that time he has made the people suffer , and you have done nothing to help them ! ” Footnotes - Exodus 5:1 The Lord Or “ Yahweh. ” See “ Yahweh ” in the Word List . - Exodus 5:3 Hebrews Or “ Israelites. ” Also in verses
ERV	Exodus	6	6	So tell the Israelites that I say to them , ‘ I am the Lord . I will save you . You will no longer be slaves of the Egyptians . I will use my great power to make you free , and I will bring terrible punishment to the Egyptians .
ERV	Exodus	6	2	Then God said to Moses , “ I am the Lord .
ERV	Exodus	6	3	I appeared to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . They called me God All-Powerful . They did not know my name , the Lord .
ERV	Exodus	6	4	I made an agreement with them . I promised to give them the land of Canaan . They lived in that land , but it was not their own .
ERV	Exodus	6	5	Now , I have heard their painful cries . I know that they are slaves in Egypt . And I remember my agreement .
ERV	Exodus	6	7	You will be my people and I will be your God . I am the Lord your God , and you will know that I made you free from Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	6	8	I made a great promise to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I promised to give them a special land . So I will lead you to that land . I will give you that land . It will be yours . I am the Lord. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	6	9	So Moses told this to the Israelites , but the people would not listen to him . They were working so hard that they were not patient with Moses .
ERV	Exodus	6	10	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Exodus	6	11	“ Go tell Pharaoh that he must let the Israelites leave his land. ”
ERV	Exodus	6	12	But Moses answered , “ Lord , the Israelites refuse to listen to me . So surely Pharaoh will also refuse to listen . I am a very bad speaker. ” [ a ]
ERV	Exodus	6	13	But the Lord talked with Moses and Aaron and commanded them to go and talk to the Israelites and to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . He commanded them to lead the Israelites out of the land of Egypt . Some of the Families of Israel
ERV	Exodus	6	14	These are the names of the leaders of the families of Israel : Israel ’ s first son , Reuben , had four sons . They were Hanoch , Pallu , Hezron , and Carmi .

ERV	Exodus	6	26	Aaron and Moses were from this tribe . And they are the men the Lord spoke to and said , “ Lead my people out of Israel in groups . [ b ] ”
ERV	Exodus	6	27	Aaron and Moses are the men who talked to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and told him to let the Israelites leave Egypt . God Repeats His Call to Moses
ERV	Exodus	6	28	The Lord spoke to Moses again in the land of Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	6	29	He said , “ I am the Lord . Tell the king of Egypt everything I tell you. ”
ERV	Exodus	6	30	But Moses , standing there before the Lord , said , “ You know me . I ’ m a very bad speaker . How will I make the king listen to me ? ” Footnotes - Exodus 6:12 I am a very bad speaker Or “ I sound like a foreigner. ” Literally , “ I have uncircumcised lips. ” - Exodus 6:26 groups Or “ divisions. ” This is a military term . It shows that Israel was organized like an army .
ERV	Exodus	7	7	Moses was
ERV	Exodus	7	2	You will tell Aaron everything that I command you . Then he will tell the king what I say . And Pharaoh will let the Israelites leave this country .
ERV	Exodus	7	3	But I will make Pharaoh stubborn so that he will not do what you tell him . Then I will do many miracles in Egypt to prove who I am .
ERV	Exodus	7	4	But he will still refuse to listen . So then I will punish Egypt very much . And I will lead my army , my people , out of that land .
ERV	Exodus	7	5	I will punish the people of Egypt , and they will learn that I am the Lord . Then I will lead my people out of their country. ”
ERV	Exodus	7	6	Moses and Aaron did what the Lord told them .
ERV	Exodus	7	80	years old at the time , and Aaron was
ERV	Exodus	7	83	. Moses ’ Walking Stick Becomes a Snake
ERV	Exodus	7	8	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
ERV	Exodus	7	9	“ Pharaoh will ask you to prove your power . He will ask you to do a miracle . Tell Aaron to throw his walking stick on the ground . While Pharaoh is watching , the stick will become a snake. ”
ERV	Exodus	7	10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and obeyed the Lord . Aaron threw his walking stick down . While Pharaoh and his officers watched , the stick became a snake .
ERV	Exodus	7	11	So Pharaoh called for his wise men and magicians . These men used their magic , and they were able to do the same thing as Aaron .
ERV	Exodus	7	12	They threw their walking sticks on the ground , and their sticks became snakes . But then Aaron ’ s walking stick ate theirs .
ERV	Exodus	7	13	Pharaoh still refused to let the people go , just as the Lord had said . Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses and Aaron . The Water Becomes Blood
ERV	Exodus	7	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Pharaoh is being stubborn . He refuses to let the people go .
ERV	Exodus	7	15	In the morning Pharaoh will go out to the river . Go to him by the edge of the Nile River . Take the walking stick that became a snake .
ERV	Exodus	7	16	Tell him this : ‘ The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , sent me to you . He told me to tell you to let his people go worship him in the desert . Until now you have not listened to the Lord .
ERV	Exodus	7	17	So the Lord says that he will do something to show you that he is the Lord . I will hit the water of the Nile River with this walking stick in my hand , and the river will turn into blood .
ERV	Exodus	7	18	The fish in the river will die , and the river will begin to stink . Then the Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the river. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	7	19	The Lord said to Moses : “ Tell Aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the rivers , canals , lakes , and every place where they store water . When he does this , all the water will turn into blood . All the water , even the water stored in wood and stone jars , will turn into blood. ”
ERV	Exodus	7	20	So Moses and Aaron did what the Lord commanded . Aaron raised the walking stick and hit the water in the Nile River . He did this in front of Pharaoh and his officials . So all the water in the river changed into blood .
ERV	Exodus	7	21	The fish in the river died , and the river began to stink . So the Egyptians could not drink water from the river . The blood was everywhere in Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	7	22	The magicians used their magic to do the same thing . So Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses and Aaron . This happened just as the Lord said .
ERV	Exodus	7	23	Pharaoh ignored what Moses and Aaron had done . He turned and went into his house .
ERV	Exodus	7	24	The Egyptians could not drink the water from the river , so they dug wells around the river for water to drink . The Frogs
ERV	Exodus	7	25	Seven days passed after the Lord changed the Nile River .
ERV	Exodus	8	8	Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said , “ Ask the Lord to remove the frogs from me and my people . I will let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	2	If you refuse to let my people go , then I will fill Egypt with frogs .
ERV	Exodus	8	3	The Nile River will be filled with frogs . They will come from the river and enter your houses . They will be in your bedrooms and in your beds . They will be in the houses of your officials and in your ovens and in your jars of water .
ERV	Exodus	8	4	The frogs will be all over you , your people , and your officials. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	8	5	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron to hold the walking stick in his hand over the canals , rivers , and lakes . Then the frogs will come out onto the land of Egypt. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron raised his hand over the waters of Egypt , and the frogs began coming out of the water and covered the land of Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	8	7	The magicians used their magic to do the same thing—so even more frogs came out onto the land in Egypt !
ERV	Exodus	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh , “ I will pray for you , your people , and your officials . Then the frogs will leave you and your houses . They will remain only in the river . When do you want the frogs to go away ? ”
ERV	Exodus	8	10	Pharaoh said , “ Tomorrow. ” Moses said , “ It will happen as you say . In this way you will know that there is no god like the Lord our God .
ERV	Exodus	8	11	The frogs will leave you , your house , your officials , and your people . They will remain only in the river. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	12	Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh . Moses prayed to the Lord about the frogs he had sent against Pharaoh .
ERV	Exodus	8	13	And the Lord did what Moses asked . The frogs died in the houses , in the yards , and in the fields .
ERV	Exodus	8	14	They began to rot , and the whole country began to stink .
ERV	Exodus	8	15	But when Pharaoh saw that they were free of the frogs , he again became stubborn . Pharaoh did not do what Moses and Aaron had asked him to do . This happened just as the Lord had said . The Lice
ERV	Exodus	8	16	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell Aaron to raise his stick and hit the dust on the ground , and everywhere in Egypt dust will become lice. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	17	They did this . Aaron raised the stick in his hand and hit the dust on the ground , and everywhere in Egypt the dust became lice . The lice got on the animals and the people .
ERV	Exodus	8	18	The magicians used their magic and tried to do the same thing . But the magicians could not make lice come from the dust . The lice remained on the animals and the people .
ERV	Exodus	8	19	So the magicians told Pharaoh that the power of God did this . But Pharaoh refused to listen to them . This happened just as the Lord had said . The Flies
ERV	Exodus	8	20	The Lord said to Moses , “ Get up in the morning and go to Pharaoh . He will go out to the river . Tell him that the Lord says , ‘ Let my people go and worship me !
ERV	Exodus	8	21	If you don ’ t let my people go , then flies will come into your houses . The flies will be on you and your officials . The houses of Egypt will be full of flies . They will be all over the ground too !
ERV	Exodus	8	22	But I will not treat the Israelites the same as the Egyptians . There will not be any flies in Goshen , where my people live . In this way you will know that I , the Lord , am in this land .
ERV	Exodus	8	23	So tomorrow I will treat my people differently from your people . This will be my proof. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	8	24	So the Lord did just what he said . Millions of flies came into Egypt . The flies were in Pharaoh ’ s house , and they were in all his officials ’ houses . They were all over Egypt . The flies were ruining the country .
ERV	Exodus	8	25	So Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ Offer sacrifices to your God here in this country. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	26	But Moses said , “ It would not be right to do that . The Egyptians think it is terrible to kill animals as sacrifices for the Lord our God . If we do this here , the Egyptians will see us and throw stones at us and kill us .
ERV	Exodus	8	27	Let us go three days into the desert and offer sacrifices to the Lord our God . This is what he told us to do. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	28	So Pharaoh said , “ I will let you go and offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the desert , but you must not go very far . Now , go and pray for me. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	29	Moses said , “ Look , I will leave and ask the Lord to remove the flies from you , your people , and your officials tomorrow . But you must not stop the people from offering sacrifices to the Lord. ”
ERV	Exodus	8	30	So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord .
ERV	Exodus	8	31	And the Lord did what Moses asked . He removed the flies from Pharaoh , his officials , and his people . None of the flies remained .
ERV	Exodus	8	32	But Pharaoh again became stubborn and did not let the people go .
ERV	Exodus	9	9	This will become dust that will go throughout the land of Egypt . Whenever the dust touches a person or an animal in Egypt , sores will break out on the skin. ”
ERV	Exodus	9	2	If you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go ,
ERV	Exodus	9	3	then the Lord will use his power against your animals in the fields . He will cause all of your horses , donkeys , camels , cattle , and sheep to get sick with a terrible disease .
ERV	Exodus	9	4	But the Lord will treat Israel ’ s animals differently from the animals of Egypt . None of the animals that belong to the Israelites will die .
ERV	Exodus	9	5	The Lord has set the time for this to happen . He said , ‘ Tomorrow the Lord will make this happen in this country. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	9	6	The next morning the Lord did what he said . All the farm animals of the Egyptians died , but none of the animals that belonged to the Israelites died .
ERV	Exodus	9	7	Pharaoh sent people to see if any of the animals of Israel died . Not one of them died . But Pharaoh remained stubborn and did not let the people go . The Boils
ERV	Exodus	9	8	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ Fill your hands with the ashes from a furnace . Moses , you throw the ashes into the air in front of Pharaoh .
ERV	Exodus	9	10	So Moses and Aaron took ashes from a furnace and went and stood before Pharaoh . Moses threw the ashes into the air , and sores began breaking out on people and animals .
ERV	Exodus	9	11	The magicians could not stop Moses from doing this , because even the magicians had the sores . This happened everywhere in Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	9	12	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn , so he refused to listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had said . The Hail
ERV	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Get up in the morning and go to Pharaoh . Tell him that the Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says , ‘ Let my people go to worship me !
ERV	Exodus	9	14	This time , I will use my full power against you , your officials , and your people . Then you will know that there is no god in the world like me .
ERV	Exodus	9	15	I could use my power and cause a disease that would wipe you and your people off the earth .
ERV	Exodus	9	16	But I have put you here for a reason . I have put you here so that I could show you my power . Then people all over the world will learn about me !
ERV	Exodus	9	17	You are still against my people . You are not letting them go free .
ERV	Exodus	9	18	So at this time tomorrow , I will cause a very bad hailstorm . There has never been a hailstorm like this in Egypt , not since Egypt became a nation .
ERV	Exodus	9	19	Now , you must put your animals in a safe place . Everything you own that is now in the fields must be put in a safe place . Any person or animal that remains in the fields will be killed . The hail will fall on everything that is not gathered into your houses. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	9	20	Some of Pharaoh ’ s officials paid attention to the Lord ’ s message . They quickly put all of their animals and slaves into houses .
ERV	Exodus	9	21	But other people ignored the Lord ’ s message and lost all their slaves and animals that were in the fields .
ERV	Exodus	9	22	The Lord told Moses , “ Raise your hand into the air and the hail will start falling all over Egypt . The hail will fall on all the people , animals , and plants in all the fields of Egypt. ”
ERV	Exodus	9	23	So Moses raised his walking stick into the air , and the Lord sent hail with thunder and lightning down on the earth . The Lord caused hail to fall all over Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	9	24	The hail was falling , and lightning was flashing all through it . It was the worst hailstorm that had ever hit Egypt since it had become a nation .
ERV	Exodus	9	25	The storm destroyed everything in the fields in Egypt . The hail destroyed people , animals , and plants . The hail also broke all the trees in the fields .
ERV	Exodus	9	26	The only place that did not get hail was the land of Goshen , where the Israelites lived .
ERV	Exodus	9	27	Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron and told them , “ This time I have sinned . The Lord is right , and I and my people are wrong .
ERV	Exodus	9	28	We have had enough of this hail and thunder ! Ask the Lord to stop the storm , and I will let you go . You don ’ t have to stay here. ”
ERV	Exodus	9	29	Moses told Pharaoh , “ When I leave the city , I will lift my hands in prayer to the Lord , and the thunder and hail will stop . Then you will know that the Lord is in this land .
ERV	Exodus	9	30	But I know that you and your officials don ’ t really fear and respect the Lord yet. ”
ERV	Exodus	9	31	The flax had already developed its seeds , and the barley was already blooming . So these plants were destroyed .
ERV	Exodus	9	32	But wheat and spelt ripen later than the other grains , so these plants were not destroyed .
ERV	Exodus	9	33	Moses left Pharaoh and went outside the city . He lifted his hands in prayer to the Lord . And the thunder and hail stopped , and then even the rain stopped .
ERV	Exodus	9	34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain , hail , and thunder had stopped , he again did wrong . He and his officials became stubborn again .
ERV	Exodus	9	35	Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go free , just as the Lord had said through Moses .
ERV	Exodus	10	10	Pharaoh said to them , “ The Lord really will have to be with you before I let you and all of your children leave Egypt . Look , you are planning something evil .
ERV	Exodus	10	2	I also did this so that you could tell your children and your grandchildren about the miracles and other wonderful things that I have done in Egypt . Then all of you will know that I am the Lord. ”
ERV	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh . They told him , “ The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , [ a ] says , ‘ How long will you refuse to obey me ? Let my people go to worship me !
ERV	Exodus	10	4	If you refuse to let my people go , then tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country .
ERV	Exodus	10	5	The locusts will cover the land . There will be so many locusts that you will not be able to see the ground . Anything that was left from the hailstorm will be eaten by the locusts . The locusts will eat all the leaves from every tree in the field .
ERV	Exodus	10	6	They will fill all your houses , and all your officials ’ houses , and all the houses in Egypt . There will be more locusts than your fathers or your grandfathers have ever seen . There will be more locusts than there have ever been since people began living in Egypt. ’ ” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh .
ERV	Exodus	10	7	Then the officials asked Pharaoh , “ How long will we be trapped by these people ? Let the men go to worship the Lord their God . If you don ’ t let them go , before you know it , Egypt will be destroyed ! ”
ERV	Exodus	10	8	So Pharaoh told his officials to bring Moses and Aaron back to him . Pharaoh said to them , “ Go and worship the Lord your God . But tell me , just who is going ? ”
ERV	Exodus	10	9	Moses answered , “ All of our people , young and old , will go . And we will take our sons and daughters , and our sheep and cattle with us . We will all go because the Lord ’ s festival is for all of us. ”
ERV	Exodus	10	11	The men can go worship the Lord . That is what you asked for in the beginning . But all of your people can not go. ” Then Pharaoh sent Moses and Aaron away .
ERV	Exodus	10	12	The Lord told Moses , “ Raise your hand over the land of Egypt and the locusts will come ! They will spread all over the land of Egypt and will eat all the plants that the hail did not destroy. ”

ERV	Exodus	10	15	They covered the ground , and the whole country became dark . The locusts ate every plant on the ground and all the fruit in the trees that the hail had not destroyed . There were no leaves left on any of the trees or plants anywhere in Egypt .
ERV	Exodus	10	16	Pharaoh quickly called for Moses and Aaron . Pharaoh said , “ I have sinned against the Lord your God and against you .

ERV	Exodus	10	26	Yes , we will take our animals with us to worship the Lord our God . Not one hoof will be left behind . We don ’ t know yet exactly what we will need to worship the Lord . We will learn that only when we get there. ”

ERV	Exodus	11	8	All these officials of yours will come down and bow to me . They will say , ‘ Leave and take all your people with you. ’ Only then will I leave ! ” Then in anger , Moses left the meeting with Pharaoh .
ERV	Exodus	11	9	Then the Lord told Moses , “ The reason Pharaoh did not listen to you is so that I could show my great power in Egypt. ”
ERV	Exodus	11	10	That is why Moses and Aaron did all these great miracles in front of Pharaoh . And that is why the Lord made Pharaoh so stubborn that he would not let the Israelites leave his country .

ERV	Exodus	16	20	But some of the people did not obey Moses . They saved their food for the next day . But worms got into the food and it began to stink . Moses was angry with the people who did this .
ERV	Exodus	16	21	Every morning the people gathered as much food as they could eat , but by noon [ f ] the food melted and was gone .
ERV	Exodus	16	22	On Friday the people gathered twice as much food—two baskets [ g ] for every person . So all the leaders of the people came and told this to Moses .
ERV	Exodus	16	23	Moses told them , “ This is what the Lord said would happen . It happened because tomorrow is the Sabbath , the special day of rest to honor the Lord . You can cook all the food you need to cook for today , but save the rest of this food for tomorrow morning. ”
ERV	Exodus	16	24	So the people saved the rest of the food for the next day , as Moses had commanded , and none of the food spoiled or had worms in it .
ERV	Exodus	16	25	On Saturday , Moses told the people , “ Today is the Sabbath , the special day of rest to honor the Lord . So none of you should be out in the fields . Eat the food you gathered yesterday .
ERV	Exodus	16	26	You should gather the food for six days . But the seventh day of the week is a day of rest—so there will not be any of the special food on the ground. ”
ERV	Exodus	16	27	On Saturday , some of the people went out to gather some of the food , but they could not find any .
ERV	Exodus	16	28	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ How long will you people refuse to obey my commands and teachings ?
ERV	Exodus	16	29	Look , the Lord has made the Sabbath a day of rest for you . So on Friday he will give you enough food for two days . Then , on the Sabbath , each of you should sit down and relax . Stay where you are. ”
ERV	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the Sabbath .
ERV	Exodus	16	31	The people called the special food “ manna . [ h ] ” It was like small white coriander seeds and tasted like thin cakes made with honey .

ERV	Exodus	17	17	The Israelites left the western Sinai desert . [ a ] They traveled all together from place to place as the Lord commanded . They camped at Rephidim , but there was no water for the people to drink .
ERV	Exodus	17	2	So they turned against Moses and started arguing with him . They said , “ Give us water to drink. ” Moses said to them , “ Why have you turned against me ? Why are you testing the Lord ? ”
ERV	Exodus	17	3	But the people were very thirsty , so they continued complaining to Moses . They said , “ Why did you bring us out of Egypt ? Did you bring us out here so that we , our children , and our cattle will all die without water ? ”
ERV	Exodus	17	4	So Moses cried to the Lord , “ What can I do with these people ? They are ready to kill me. ”
ERV	Exodus	17	5	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go before the Israelites . Take some of the elders of the people with you . Carry your walking stick with you . This is the stick that you used when you hit the Nile River .
ERV	Exodus	17	6	I will stand before you on a rock at Horeb . [ b ] Hit that rock with the walking stick and water will come out of it . Then the people can drink. ” Moses did these things and the elders of Israel saw it .
ERV	Exodus	17	7	Moses named that place Meribah [ c ] and Massah , [ d ] because this was the place that the Israelites turned against him and tested the Lord . The people wanted to know if the Lord was with them or not . War With the Amalekites
ERV	Exodus	17	8	At Rephidim the Amalekites came and fought against the Israelites .
ERV	Exodus	17	9	So Moses said to Joshua , “ Choose some men and go and fight the Amalekites tomorrow . I will stand on the top of the hill and watch you . I will be holding the walking stick God gave me. ”
ERV	Exodus	17	10	Joshua obeyed Moses and went to fight the Amalekites the next day . At the same time Moses , Aaron , and Hur went to the top of the hill .
ERV	Exodus	17	11	Any time Moses held his hands in the air , the men of Israel would start winning the fight . But when Moses put his hands down , the men of Israel began to lose the fight .
ERV	Exodus	17	12	After some time , Moses ’ arms became tired . So they put a large rock under Moses for him to sit on . Then Aaron and Hur held Moses ’ hands in the air . Aaron was on one side of Moses and Hur was on the other side . They held his hands up like this until the sun went down .
ERV	Exodus	17	13	So Joshua and his men defeated the Amalekites in this battle .
ERV	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Write about this battle . Write these things in a book so that people will remember what happened here . And be sure to tell Joshua that I will completely destroy the Amalekites from the earth. ”
ERV	Exodus	17	15	Then Moses built an altar and named it , “ The Lord is My Flag. ”
ERV	Exodus	17	16	Moses said , “ I lifted my hands toward the Lord ’ s throne . So the Lord fought against the Amalekites , as he always has. ” Footnotes - Exodus 17:1 western Sinai desert Literally , “ desert of Sin. ” - Exodus 17:6 Horeb Another name for Mount Sinai . - Exodus 17:7 Meribah This name means “ argument ” or “ rebellion. ” - Exodus 17:7 Massah This name means “ trial , ” “ temptation , ” or “ test . ”

ERV	Exodus	18	2	So Jethro went to Moses while Moses was camped near the mountain of God . [ a ] Jethro brought Moses ’ wife , Zipporah , with him . ( Zipporah was not with Moses , because Moses had sent her home . )
ERV	Exodus	18	3	Jethro also brought Moses ’ two sons with him . The first son was named Gershom , [ b ] because when he was born , Moses said , “ I am a stranger in a foreign country. ”
ERV	Exodus	18	4	The other son was named Eliezer , [ c ] because when he was born , Moses said , “ The God of my father helped me and saved me from the king of Egypt. ”
ERV	Exodus	18	5	So Jethro went to Moses while Moses was camped in the desert near the mountain of God . Moses ’ wife and his two sons were with Jethro .
ERV	Exodus	18	6	Jethro sent a message to Moses that said , “ This is your father-in-law Jethro . I am bringing your wife and her two sons to you. ”
ERV	Exodus	18	7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law . Moses bowed down before him and kissed him . The two men asked about each other ’ s health . Then they went into Moses ’ tent to talk more .
ERV	Exodus	18	8	Moses told Jethro everything the Lord had done for the Israelites . He told what the Lord did to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt . He told about all the problems they had along the way . And he told his father-in-law how the Lord saved the Israelites every time there was trouble .
ERV	Exodus	18	9	Jethro was happy when he heard all the good things the Lord had done for Israel . He was glad that the Lord had freed the Israelites from the Egyptians .
ERV	Exodus	18	10	He said , “ Praise the Lord ! He freed you from the power of Egypt . He saved you from Pharaoh .
ERV	Exodus	18	11	Now I know the Lord is greater than all the gods . They thought they were in control , but look what God did ! ”
ERV	Exodus	18	12	Jethro got some sacrifices and offerings to honor God . Then Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat with Moses ’ father-in-law Jethro . They all ate together there with God .
ERV	Exodus	18	13	The next day , Moses had the special job of judging the people . There were so many people that they had to stand before him all day .
ERV	Exodus	18	14	Jethro saw Moses judging the people . He asked , “ Why are you doing this ? Why are you the only judge ? And why do people come to you all day ? ”
ERV	Exodus	18	15	Then Moses said to his father-in-law , “ The people come to me and ask me to ask for God ’ s decision for their problem .
ERV	Exodus	18	16	If people have an argument , they come to me , and I decide which person is right . In this way I teach the people God ’ s laws and teachings. ”
ERV	Exodus	18	17	But Moses ’ father-in-law said to him , “ This isn ’ t the right way to do this .
ERV	Exodus	18	19	Now , listen to me . Let me give you some advice . And I pray God will be with you . You should continue listening to the problems of the people . And you should continue to speak to God about these things .
ERV	Exodus	18	20	You should explain God ’ s laws and teachings to the people . Warn them not to break the laws . Tell them the right way to live and what they should do .
ERV	Exodus	18	21	But you should also choose some of the people to be judges and leaders . “ Choose good men you can trust—men who respect God . Choose men who will not change their decisions for money . Make these men rulers over the people . There should be rulers over
ERV	Exodus	18	1000	people ,
ERV	Exodus	18	100	people ,
ERV	Exodus	18	50	people , and ten people .
ERV	Exodus	18	22	Let these rulers judge the people . If there is a very important case , then they can come to you and let you decide what to do . But they can decide the other cases themselves . In this way these men will share your work with you , and it will be easier for you to lead the people .
ERV	Exodus	18	23	If you do this as God directs you , then you will be able to do your job without tiring yourself out . And the people can still have all their problems solved before they return home. ”
ERV	Exodus	18	24	So Moses did what Jethro told him .
ERV	Exodus	18	25	Moses chose good men from among the Israelites . He made them leaders over the people . There were rulers over
ERV	Exodus	18	26	These rulers were judges for the people . The people could always bring their arguments to these rulers , and Moses had to decide only the most important cases .
ERV	Exodus	18	27	After a short time Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law Jethro , and Jethro went back to his own home .

ERV	Exodus	19	19	The noise from the trumpet became louder and louder . Every time Moses spoke to God , God answered him with a voice like thunder .
ERV	Exodus	19	2	They had traveled from Rephidim to the Sinai desert . The Israelites camped in the desert near Mount Sinai .
ERV	Exodus	19	3	Then Moses climbed up the mountain to meet with God . The Lord spoke to him on the mountain and said , “ Tell this to the Israelites , the great family of Jacob :
ERV	Exodus	19	4	‘ You people saw what I did to the people of Egypt . You saw that I carried you out of Egypt like an eagle and brought you here to me .
ERV	Exodus	19	5	So now I tell you to obey my commands and keep my agreement . So if you do this , you will be my own special people . The whole world belongs to me , but I am choosing you to be my own special people .
ERV	Exodus	19	6	You will be a special nation—a kingdom of priests. ’ Moses , you must tell the Israelites what I have said. ”
ERV	Exodus	19	7	So Moses climbed down the mountain and called the elders of the people together . Moses told the elders everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them .
ERV	Exodus	19	8	All the people spoke at the same time and said , “ We will obey everything the Lord says. ” Then Moses went back up the mountain and told the Lord that the people would obey him .
ERV	Exodus	19	9	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I will come to you in the thick cloud . I will speak to you . All the people will hear me talking to you . I will do this so that they will always believe what you tell them. ” Then Moses told God everything the people had said .
ERV	Exodus	19	10	And the Lord said to Moses , “ Today and tomorrow you must prepare the people for a special meeting . They must wash their clothes
ERV	Exodus	19	11	and be ready for me on the third day . On the third day , the Lord will come down to Mount Sinai . And all the people will see me . 12-13 But you must tell the people to stay away from the mountain . Make a line and don ’ t let them cross it . Any person or animal that touches the mountain must be killed with stones or shot with arrows . But don ’ t let anyone touch them . The people must wait until the trumpet blows . Only then can they go up the mountain. ”
ERV	Exodus	19	14	So Moses climbed down the mountain and went to the people . He got them ready for the special meeting and they washed their clothes .
ERV	Exodus	19	15	Then Moses said to the people , “ Be ready for the meeting with God in three days . Until that time do not have sexual relations. ”
ERV	Exodus	19	16	On the morning of the third day , a thick cloud came down onto the mountain . There was thunder and lightning and a very loud sound from a trumpet . All the people in the camp were frightened .
ERV	Exodus	19	17	Then Moses led the people out of the camp to a place near the mountain to meet God .
ERV	Exodus	19	18	Mount Sinai was covered with smoke . Smoke rose off the mountain like smoke from a furnace . This happened because the Lord came down to the mountain in fire . Also the whole mountain began to shake .
ERV	Exodus	19	20	So the Lord came down to Mount Sinai . He came from heaven to the top of the mountain . Then he called Moses to come up to the top of the mountain with him . So Moses went up the mountain .
ERV	Exodus	19	21	The Lord said to Moses , “ Go down and warn the people not to come near me and look at me . If they do , many will die .
ERV	Exodus	19	22	Also tell the priests who come near the Lord that they must prepare themselves for this special meeting . If they don ’ t , I , the Lord , will punish them. ”
ERV	Exodus	19	23	Moses said to the Lord , “ But the people can not come up the mountain . You yourself told us to make a line and not allow the people to cross the line to holy ground. ”
ERV	Exodus	19	24	The Lord said to him , “ Go down to the people . Get Aaron and bring him back with you . But don ’ t let the priests or the people come near me . I will punish them if they come too close. ”
ERV	Exodus	19	25	So Moses went down to the people and told them these things .
ERV	Exodus	20	20	Then Moses said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! God has come to test you . He wants you to respect him so that you will not sin. ”
ERV	Exodus	20	2	“ I am the Lord your God . I am the one who freed you from the land of Egypt , where you were slaves .
ERV	Exodus	20	3	“ You must not worship any other gods except me .
ERV	Exodus	20	4	“ You must not make any idols . Don ’ t make any statues or pictures of anything up in the sky or of anything on the earth or of anything down in the water .
ERV	Exodus	20	5	Don ’ t worship or serve idols of any kind , because I , the Lord , am your God . I hate my people worshiping other gods . [ a ] People who sin against me become my enemies , and I will punish them . And I will punish their children , their grandchildren , and even their great-grandchildren .
ERV	Exodus	20	6	But I will be very kind to people who love me and obey my commands . I will be kind to their families for thousands of generations . [ b ]
ERV	Exodus	20	7	“ You must not use the name of the Lord your God to make empty promises . If you do , the Lord will not let you go unpunished .
ERV	Exodus	20	8	“ You must remember to keep the Sabbath a special day .
ERV	Exodus	20	9	You may work six days a week to do your job .
ERV	Exodus	20	10	But the seventh day is a day of rest in honor of the Lord your God . So on that day no one should work—not you , your sons and daughters , or your men and women slaves . Even your animals and the foreigners living in your cities must not work !
ERV	Exodus	20	11	That is because the Lord worked six days and made the sky , the earth , the sea , and everything in them . And on the seventh day , he rested . In this way the Lord blessed the Sabbath—the day of rest . He made that a very special day .
ERV	Exodus	20	12	“ You must honor and respect your father and your mother . Do this so that you will have a full life in the land that the Lord your God gives you .
ERV	Exodus	20	13	“ You must not murder anyone .

ERV	Exodus	20	17	“ You must not want to take your neighbor ’ s house . You must not want his wife . And you must not want his men and women servants or his cattle or his donkeys . You must not want to take anything that belongs to another person. ” The People Are Afraid of God
ERV	Exodus	20	18	During all this time , the people in the valley heard the thundering and saw the lightning on the mountain . They saw smoke rising from the mountain and heard the sound of the trumpet . They were afraid and shook with fear . They stood away from the mountain and watched .
ERV	Exodus	20	19	Then the people said to Moses , “ If you want to speak to us , then we will listen . But please don ’ t let God speak to us . If this happens , we will die. ”
ERV	Exodus	20	21	The people stood far away from the mountain while Moses went to the dark cloud where God was .
ERV	Exodus	20	22	Then the Lord told Moses to say this to the Israelites : “ You people have seen that I talked with you from heaven .
ERV	Exodus	20	23	So you must not make idols using gold or silver to compete with me . You must not make these false gods .
ERV	Exodus	20	24	“ Make a special altar for me . You should use dirt to make this altar . Offer sheep and cattle as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on this altar . Do this in every place where I tell you to remember me . Then I will come and bless you .
ERV	Exodus	20	25	But if you use stones to make an altar , then don ’ t use stones that were cut with an iron tool . [ d ] If you do that , it will make the altar unacceptable .
ERV	Exodus	20	26	And you must not make steps leading up to the altar . If there are steps , when people look up to the altar , they will be able to see under your clothes. ” Footnotes - Exodus 20:5 I hate … gods Or “ I am El Kanah—the Jealous God. ” - Exodus 20:6 Or “ But I will show mercy to thousands of people who love me and obey my commands. ” - Exodus 20:16 Or “ You must not be a false witness against your neighbor. ” - Exodus 20:25 iron tool Literally , “ sword . ”
ERV	Exodus	21	21	But if the slave gets up after a few days , then the master will not be punished . [ d ] That is because someone paid their money for the slave , and the slave belongs to them .
ERV	Exodus	21	2	“ If you buy a Hebrew [ a ] slave , then that slave will serve for only six years . After six years , he will be free , and he will have to pay nothing .
ERV	Exodus	21	3	If he is not married when he becomes your slave , when he becomes free , he will leave without a wife . But if the man is married when he becomes your slave , then he will keep his wife at the time he is made free .
ERV	Exodus	21	4	If the slave is not married , the master can give him a wife . If that wife gives birth to sons or daughters , she and her children will belong to the master . After the slave is finished with his years of service , he will be made free .
ERV	Exodus	21	5	“ But if the slave decides that he wants to stay with the master , he must say , ‘ I love my master . I love my wife and my children . I will not become free—I will stay. ’
ERV	Exodus	21	6	If this happens , the master will bring the slave before God . [ b ] The master will take the slave to a door or the wooden frame around the door and pierce the slave ’ s ear using a sharp tool to show that the slave will serve that master for all his life .
ERV	Exodus	21	7	“ A man might decide to sell his daughter as a slave . If this happens , the rules for making her free are not the same as the rules for making the men slaves free .
ERV	Exodus	21	8	If the master who chose her for himself is not pleased with her , then he can sell the woman back to her father . If the master broke his promise to marry her , he loses the right to sell her to other people .
ERV	Exodus	21	9	If the master promised to let the slave woman marry his son , he must treat her like a daughter , not like a slave .
ERV	Exodus	21	10	“ If the master marries another woman , he must not give less food or clothing to the first wife . And he must continue to give her what she has a right to have in marriage .
ERV	Exodus	21	11	The man must do these three things for her . If he does not , the woman is made free , and it will cost her nothing . She owes no money to the man .
ERV	Exodus	21	12	“ Whoever hits and kills someone must be killed too .
ERV	Exodus	21	13	But if an accident happens , and a person kills someone without planning it , then God allowed that thing to happen . I will choose some special places where people can run to for safety . So that person can run to one of those places .

ERV	Exodus	30	34	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Get these sweet-smelling spices : resin , onycha , galbanum , and pure frankincense . Be sure that you have equal amounts of these spices .

ERV	Exodus	31	3	I have filled Bezalel with the Spirit of God—I have given him the skill and knowledge to do all kinds of things .

ERV	Exodus	31	10	the special clothes for Aaron the priest ; the special clothes for Aaron ’ s sons when they serve as priests ;
ERV	Exodus	31	11	the sweet-smelling anointing oil ; the sweet-smelling incense for the Holy Place . These workers must make everything the way that I have commanded you. ” The Sabbath
ERV	Exodus	31	12	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Exodus	31	13	“ Tell the Israelites this : ‘ You must follow the rules about my special days of rest . You must do this because they will be a sign between you and me for all generations . This will show you that I , the Lord , have made you my special people .
ERV	Exodus	31	14	“ ‘ Make the Sabbath a special day . If someone treats the Sabbath like any other day , that person must be killed . Whoever works on the Sabbath day must be separated from their people .
ERV	Exodus	31	15	There are six other days in the week for working . But the seventh day is a very special day of rest . That is the special day to honor the Lord . Anyone who works during the Sabbath must be killed .
ERV	Exodus	31	16	The Israelites must remember the Sabbath and make it a special day . They must continue to do this forever . It is an agreement between them and me that will continue forever .
ERV	Exodus	31	17	The Sabbath will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever. ’ ” ( The Lord worked six days and made the sky and the earth , and on the seventh day he rested and relaxed . )
ERV	Exodus	31	18	When God finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai , he gave him the two stone tablets of the agreement . God had written on the stones with his finger .
ERV	Exodus	32	32	Now , forgive them of this sin . If you will not forgive them , then erase my name from your book . [ d ] ”
ERV	Exodus	32	2	Aaron said to the people , “ Bring me the gold earrings that belong to your wives , sons , and daughters. ”
ERV	Exodus	32	3	So the people collected all their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron .
ERV	Exodus	32	4	He took the gold from the people and used it to make an idol . Using a special tool , he shaped the gold into a statue of a calf . Then the people said , “ Israel , here are your gods ! These are the gods that brought you out of the land of Egypt ! ” [ a ]
ERV	Exodus	32	5	Aaron saw all these things , so he built an altar in front of the calf . Then Aaron made an announcement . He said , “ Tomorrow will be a special festival to honor the Lord. ”
ERV	Exodus	32	6	The people woke up very early the next morning . They killed animals and offered them as burnt offerings and fellowship offerings . They sat down to eat and drink . Then they got up and had a wild party .
ERV	Exodus	32	7	At the same time , the Lord said to Moses , “ Go down from this mountain . Your people , the people you brought out of the land of Egypt , have committed a terrible sin .
ERV	Exodus	32	8	They have very quickly turned away from what I commanded them to do . They made a calf from melted gold for themselves . They are worshiping that calf and making sacrifices to it . The people have said , ‘ Israel , these are the gods that led you out of Egypt. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	32	9	The Lord said to Moses , “ I have seen these people , and I know that they are very stubborn . They will always turn against me .
ERV	Exodus	32	10	So now let me destroy them in anger . Then I will make a great nation from you. ”
ERV	Exodus	32	11	But Moses begged the Lord his God , “ Lord , don ’ t let your anger destroy your people . You brought them out of Egypt with your great power and strength .
ERV	Exodus	32	12	But if you destroy your people , the Egyptians will say , ‘ God planned to do bad things to his people . That is why he led them out of Egypt . He wanted to kill them in the mountains . He wanted to wipe them off the earth. ’ So don ’ t be angry with your people . Please change your mind ! Don ’ t destroy them .
ERV	Exodus	32	13	Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel . These men served you , and you used your name to make a promise to them . You said , ‘ I will make your people as many as the stars in the sky . I will give your people all this land as I promised . This land will be theirs forever. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	32	14	So the Lord felt sorry for the people . He did not do what he said he might do—he did not destroy them .
ERV	Exodus	32	15	Then Moses went down the mountain . He had the two stone tablets with the agreement on them . The commandments were written on both sides of the stone , front and back .
ERV	Exodus	32	16	God himself made the stones , and God himself wrote the commandments on them .
ERV	Exodus	32	17	Joshua heard the noise from the party in camp . He said to Moses , “ It sounds like war down in the camp ! ”
ERV	Exodus	32	18	Moses answered , “ It is not the noise of an army shouting for victory . And it is not the noise of an army crying from defeat . The noise I hear is the sound of music . [ b ] ”
ERV	Exodus	32	19	When Moses came near the camp , he saw the golden calf and the people dancing . He became very angry , and he threw the stone tablets on the ground . The stones broke into several pieces at the bottom of the mountain .
ERV	Exodus	32	20	Then Moses destroyed the calf that the people had made . He melted it in the fire . Then he ground the gold until it became dust and threw it into the water . Then he forced the Israelites to drink that water .
ERV	Exodus	32	21	Moses said to Aaron , “ What did these people do to you that would make you do this ? Why did you lead them to do such a terrible sin ? ”
ERV	Exodus	32	22	Aaron answered , “ Don ’ t be angry , sir . You know that these people are always ready to do wrong .
ERV	Exodus	32	23	The people said to me , ‘ Moses led us out of Egypt , but we don ’ t know what has happened to him . So make us some gods to lead us. ’
ERV	Exodus	32	24	So I told the people , ‘ If you have any gold rings , then give them to me. ’ The people gave me their gold . I threw the gold into the fire , and out of the fire came this calf ! ”
ERV	Exodus	32	25	Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control . They were being wild , and all their enemies could see them acting like fools .
ERV	Exodus	32	26	So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said , “ Anyone who wants to follow the Lord should come to me. ” Everyone from the tribe of Levi ran to Moses .
ERV	Exodus	32	27	Then Moses said to them , “ I will tell you what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Every man must get his sword and go from one end of the camp to the other . You men must kill those who are against the Lord , even if they are your brothers , friends , or neighbors. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	32	28	The people from the tribe of Levi obeyed Moses . That day about
ERV	Exodus	32	3000	of the people died .
ERV	Exodus	32	29	Then Moses said , “ Take your role today as special servants of the Lord because you were willing to fight against even your own sons and brothers . You will receive a blessing for this. ” [ c ]
ERV	Exodus	32	30	The next morning Moses told the people , “ You have committed a terrible sin ! But now I will go up to the Lord , and maybe I can do something so that he will forgive you for your sin. ”
ERV	Exodus	32	31	So Moses went back to the Lord and said , “ Please listen ! These people committed a terrible sin and made a god from gold .
ERV	Exodus	32	33	But the Lord said to Moses , “ The only people I erase from my book are those who sin against me .
ERV	Exodus	32	34	So now , go down and lead the people where I tell you to go . My angel will go before you and lead you . When the time comes to punish those who sinned , they will be punished. ”
ERV	Exodus	32	35	So the Lord caused a terrible sickness to come to the people . He did this because they told Aaron to make the golden calf . Footnotes - Exodus 32:4 Israel … Egypt This shows that the people worshiped the calf as a special symbol for the Lord , and even this was forbidden . See
ERV	Exodus	32	1	Kings 12:26-30 . - Exodus 32:18 music Or “ singing. ” - Exodus 32:29 Take your role … blessing for this This seems to be the point when the priesthood changed . Before this time , the priests came from the firstborn sons ; after this time , they came from the sons of Aaron of the tribe of Levi . - Exodus 32:32 your book The book of life , in which God has written the names of his chosen people . See Rev . 3:5 ; 21:27 .
ERV	Exodus	33	33	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ You and the people you brought out of Egypt must leave this place . Go to the land that I promised to give to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I promised them that I would give that land to their descendants .
ERV	Exodus	33	2	So I will send an angel to go before you , and I will defeat the Canaanites , Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites . I will force them to leave your land .
ERV	Exodus	33	3	So go to the land filled with many good things , [ a ] but I will not go with you . You people are very stubborn . If I go with you , I might destroy you along the way. ”
ERV	Exodus	33	4	The people heard this bad news and became very sad , so they stopped wearing jewelry .
ERV	Exodus	33	5	This was because the Lord said to Moses , “ Tell the Israelites , ‘ You are a stubborn people . I might destroy you even if I travel with you only a short time . So take off all your jewelry while I decide [ b ] what to do with you. ’ ”
ERV	Exodus	33	6	So the Israelites stopped wearing their jewelry at Mount Horeb . The Temporary Meeting Tent
ERV	Exodus	33	7	Moses used to take a tent a short way outside the camp . He called it “ the meeting tent . [ c ] ” Anyone who wanted to ask something from the Lord would go to the meeting tent outside the camp .
ERV	Exodus	33	8	Any time Moses went out to the tent , all the people watched him . They stood at the entrance of their tents and watched Moses until he entered the meeting tent .
ERV	Exodus	33	9	Whenever Moses went into the tent , the tall cloud would come down and stay at the entrance to the tent . And the Lord would speak with Moses .
ERV	Exodus	33	10	So when the people saw the cloud at the entrance of the tent , they would go to the entrance of their own tents and bow down to worship God .
ERV	Exodus	33	11	In this way the Lord spoke to Moses face to face like a man speaks with his friend . Then Moses would go back to the camp , but his helper , Joshua son of Nun , always stayed in the tent . Moses Sees the Glory of the Lord
ERV	Exodus	33	12	Moses said to the Lord , “ You told me to lead these people , but you did not say who you would send with me . You said to me , ‘ I know you very well , and I am pleased with you. ’
ERV	Exodus	33	13	If I have really pleased you , then teach me your ways . I want to know you . Then I can continue to please you . Remember that these people are your nation. ”
ERV	Exodus	33	14	The Lord answered , “ I myself will go with you . I will lead you. ” [ d ]
ERV	Exodus	33	15	Then Moses said to him , “ If you don ’ t go with us , then don ’ t make us leave this place .
ERV	Exodus	33	16	Also , how will we know if you are pleased with me and these people ? If you go with us , we will know for sure . If you don ’ t go with us , these people and I will be no different from any other people on the earth. ”
ERV	Exodus	33	17	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ I will do what you ask . I will do this because I am pleased with you and because I know you very well. ” [ e ]
ERV	Exodus	33	18	Then Moses said , “ Now , please show me your Glory. ”
ERV	Exodus	33	19	Then the Lord answered , “ I will show my love and mercy to anyone I want to . So I will cause my perfect goodness to pass by in front of you , and I will speak my name , Yahweh , so that you can hear it .
ERV	Exodus	33	20	But you can not see my face . No one can see me and continue to live. ”

ERV	Leviticus	7	34	I will accept the breast that was lifted up and the gift of the right thigh from the Israelites . Then I will give these things to Aaron and his sons . This is their share from the fellowship offerings of the Israelites forever. ”
ERV	Leviticus	7	35	Those parts from the gifts offered to the Lord were given to Aaron and his sons . Whenever Aaron and his sons serve as the Lord ’ s priests , they get that share of the sacrifices .
ERV	Leviticus	7	36	The Lord commanded the Israelites to give those parts to the priests once they have been anointed . That will be their share from the Israelites forever .
ERV	Leviticus	7	37	These are the laws about burnt offerings , grain offerings , sin offerings , guilt offerings , fellowship offerings , and offerings for when the priests are appointed .

ERV	Leviticus	8	27	Then he put all of it in the hands of Aaron and his sons . Moses lifted these pieces to show he was offering them before the Lord .
ERV	Leviticus	8	28	Then Moses took these things from the hands of Aaron and his sons and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering . So this was the offering for appointing Aaron and his sons as priests . It was a sweet-smelling gift to the Lord .
ERV	Leviticus	8	29	Moses took the breast and lifted it to show he had presented it to the Lord . It was Moses ’ share of the ram for appointing the priests . This was just as the Lord had commanded him .

ERV	Leviticus	9	3	Tell the Israelites , ‘ Take a male goat for a sin offering , and take a calf and a lamb for a burnt offering . The calf and the lamb must each be one year old . There must be nothing wrong with them .
ERV	Leviticus	9	4	Take a bull and a ram for fellowship offerings . Take these animals and a grain offering mixed with oil for an offering to the Lord . Do this because the Lord will appear to you today. ’ ”

ERV	Leviticus	10	3	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ The Lord says , ‘ The priests who come near me must respect me . I must be holy to them and to all the people. ’ ” So Aaron did not say anything about his sons dying .
ERV	Leviticus	10	4	Aaron ’ s uncle Uzziel had two sons . They were Mishael and Elzaphan . Moses said to these sons , “ Come here and get your cousins ’ bodies and carry them away from this holy place and take them outside the camp. ”

ERV	Leviticus	10	9	“ You and your sons must not drink wine or beer when you come into the Meeting Tent . If you do , you will die . This law continues forever through your generations .
ERV	Leviticus	10	11	And you must teach the people about all the laws that the Lord gave them through Moses. ”
ERV	Leviticus	10	12	Aaron had two sons who were still alive , Eleazar and Ithamar . Moses said to Aaron and his two sons , “ When people give sacrifices as a gift to the Lord , some of the grain offering is not burned . Use that grain to make bread without yeast . You priests must eat that bread near the altar because that grain is very holy .
ERV	Leviticus	10	13	The portion of food for you and your sons will come from the special gifts to the Lord , so you must eat that food in a holy place .
ERV	Leviticus	10	14	“ You , your sons , and your daughters may all eat the breast and thigh that were lifted up before the Lord as an offering .

ERV	Leviticus	10	15	The people must bring the gifts of fat from their animals as part of the sacrifice . They must also bring the thigh of the fellowship offering and the breast that is lifted up to show it is offered in front of the Lord . Then it will be your share of the offering .

ERV	Leviticus	10	16	Moses looked for the goat of the sin offering , but it was already burned up . Moses became very angry with Aaron ’ s other sons Eleazar and Ithamar . Moses said ,
ERV	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy area ! That meat is very holy ! God gave it to you to carry away the guilt of the people—to make the people pure before the Lord .
ERV	Leviticus	10	18	That goat ’ s blood was not brought into the Holy Place . So you should have eaten the meat in the holy area , just as I commanded ! ”
ERV	Leviticus	10	19	But Aaron said to Moses , “ Look , today they brought their sin offering and burnt offering before the Lord . But you know what happened to me today ! Do you think the Lord would be happy if I ate the sin offering today ? ”

ERV	Numbers	5	6	“ Tell this to the Israelites : You might do something wrong to another person . When you do that , you are really sinning against God . So you are guilty of doing wrong .

ERV	Numbers	5	11	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	5	12	“ Tell the Israelites this : A man ’ s wife might be unfaithful to him .
ERV	Numbers	5	13	She might have sexual relations with another man and hide this from her husband . And there might not be anyone to tell him that his wife committed this sin . Her husband might never know about the wrong thing she did , and she might not tell her husband about her sin .
ERV	Numbers	5	14	But the husband might begin to think that his wife sinned against him , whether she has or not . He might become jealous . He might begin to believe that she is not pure and true to him .
ERV	Numbers	5	15	If that happens , he must take his wife to the priest . The husband must also take an offering of
ERV	Numbers	5	16	“ The priest will take the woman before the Lord and make her stand there .
ERV	Numbers	5	17	Then he will take some special water and put it in a clay jar . He will put some dirt from the floor of the Holy Tent into the water .
ERV	Numbers	5	18	He will force the woman to stand before the Lord . Then he will loosen her hair and put the grain offering in her hand . This is the barley flour that her husband gave because he was jealous . At the same time , he will hold the clay jar of special water . This is the special water that can bring trouble to the woman .
ERV	Numbers	5	19	“ Then the priest will make the woman promise to tell the truth and say to her : ‘ If you have not slept with another man , and if you have not sinned against your husband while you were married to him , then this water that causes trouble will not hurt you .
ERV	Numbers	5	20	But if you have sinned against your husband—if you had sexual relations with a man who is not your husband—then you are not pure .
ERV	Numbers	5	21	If that is true , you will have much trouble when you drink this special water . You will not be able to have any children . And if you are pregnant now , your baby will die . [ c ] And the Lord will cause your people to speak evil of you and curse you. ’ “ Then the priest must tell the woman to make an oath . She must agree for the Lord to cause these things to happen to her if she lies .
ERV	Numbers	5	22	The priest must say , ‘ You must drink this water that causes trouble . If you have sinned , you will not be able to have children . Any baby you have will die before it is born. ’ And the woman should say , ‘ I agree to do as you say. ’
ERV	Numbers	5	23	“ The priest should write these warnings on a scroll . Then he should wash the words off into the water .
ERV	Numbers	5	24	Then the woman must drink the water that brings trouble . This water will enter her and , if she is guilty , it will cause her much suffering .
ERV	Numbers	5	25	“ Then the priest will take the grain offering from her ( the offering for jealousy ) and raise it before the Lord . Then he will carry it to the altar .
ERV	Numbers	5	26	The priest will fill his hands with some of the grain and put it on the altar and let it burn there . After that he will tell the woman to drink the water .
ERV	Numbers	5	27	If the woman has sinned against her husband , the water will bring her trouble . The water will go into her body and cause her much suffering . Any baby that is in her will die before it is born , and she will never be able to have children . All the people will turn against her . [ d ]
ERV	Numbers	5	28	But if the woman has not sinned against her husband and she is pure , the priest will say that she is not guilty . Then she will be normal and able to have children .
ERV	Numbers	5	29	“ So this is the law about jealousy . This is what you should do when a woman sins against her husband while she is married to him .
ERV	Numbers	5	30	Or if the man becomes jealous and thinks his wife has sinned against him , this is what the man should do . The priest must tell her to stand before the Lord . Then the priest will do all these things . This is the law .
ERV	Numbers	5	31	The husband will not be guilty of doing anything wrong , but the woman will suffer if she has sinned. ” Footnotes - Numbers 5:2 serious skin disease This could be leprosy , or it could be another kind of contagious skin disease . - Numbers 5:15
ERV	Numbers	6	6	“ If you have taken the Nazirite vow , you must not go near someone who is dying [ a ] during that special time of dedication . You have given yourself fully to the Lord ,
ERV	Numbers	6	2	“ Tell the Israelites this : If there are people , men or women , who want to make a vow dedicating themselves to the Lord as Nazirites for a time , this is what they must do :
ERV	Numbers	6	3	They must stay away from wine or other strong drink . They must not drink vinegar that is made from wine or from other strong drink . They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins .
ERV	Numbers	6	4	During that special time of dedication , they must not eat anything that comes from grapes . They must not even eat the seeds or the skins from grapes .
ERV	Numbers	6	5	“ The whole time of their Nazirite vow they must not cut their hair . They must be holy until this time of special dedication to the Lord is ended . They must let their hair grow long .
ERV	Numbers	6	7	so you must not let yourself become unclean like this—even for your own father or mother , brother or sister when they die . [ b ] This is because you have the hair that you dedicated to God on your head !
ERV	Numbers	6	8	It is holy because you have given yourself fully to the Lord for the full time of that dedication .
ERV	Numbers	6	9	So if you are with someone when they suddenly die , you will be unclean and you will have to shave the hair from your head . You must do that on the seventh day of your purification ceremony when you are made clean .
ERV	Numbers	6	10	Then on the eighth day , you must bring two doves or two young pigeons and give them to the priest at the entrance of the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Numbers	6	11	Then the priest will offer one bird as a sin offering and the other one as a burnt offering . The burnt offering will be a payment for the sin of touching a dead body during your special time of dedication . Then you must again promise to give the hair on your head as a gift to God .
ERV	Numbers	6	12	This means you must again give yourself to the Lord for another time of dedication . You must bring a one-year-old male lamb to offer as a guilt offering . You must start over from the beginning with a new time of dedication because you touched a dead body during your first time of dedication .
ERV	Numbers	6	13	“ After their time of dedication is ended , Nazirites must go to the entrance of the Meeting Tent
ERV	Numbers	6	14	and give their offering to the Lord . Their offering must be : a one-year-old male lamb that has nothing wrong with it for a burnt offering ; a one-year-old female lamb that has nothing wrong with it for a sin offering ; one ram that has nothing wrong with it for a fellowship offering ;
ERV	Numbers	6	15	a basket of bread made without yeast—bread made with fine flour mixed with oil and wafers with oil spread on top ; and the grain offerings and drink offerings that are a part of these gifts .
ERV	Numbers	6	16	“ The priest will give these things to the Lord , and then the priest will make the sin offering and the burnt offering .
ERV	Numbers	6	17	He will give the basket of bread without yeast to the Lord . Then he will kill the ram as a fellowship offering to the Lord . He will give it to the Lord with the grain offering and the drink offering .
ERV	Numbers	6	18	“ The Nazirites must go to the entrance of the Meeting Tent . There they must shave off their hair that they grew as a dedication to the Lord . That hair will be put in the fire that is burning under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering .
ERV	Numbers	6	19	“ After the Nazirites have cut off their hair , the priest will give them a boiled shoulder from the ram and a large and a small cake from the basket . Both of these cakes are made without yeast .
ERV	Numbers	6	20	Then the priest will lift these things up to show that they were presented before the Lord . These things are holy and belong to the priest . Also , the ram ’ s breast and thigh that were lifted up and presented belong to the priest . After that the Nazirites can drink wine .
ERV	Numbers	6	21	“ These are the rules for those who decide to make the Nazirite vow . They must give all these gifts to the Lord . But they might be able to give much more . If they promise to do more , they must keep their promise . But they must give at least all the things listed in these rules for the Nazirite vow. ” The Priests ’ Blessings

ERV	Numbers	9	5	The people did this in the desert of Sinai just before dark on the 14th day of the first month . The Israelites did everything just as the Lord commanded Moses .
ERV	Numbers	9	6	But some of the people could not celebrate Passover that day . They were unclean because they had touched a dead body . So they went to Moses and Aaron that day
ERV	Numbers	9	7	and said to Moses , “ We touched a dead body and became unclean . But why must we be kept from offering our gifts to the Lord at the chosen time with the rest of the Israelites ? ”
ERV	Numbers	9	8	Moses said to them , “ I will ask the Lord what he says about this. ”

ERV	Numbers	9	16	The cloud stayed over the Holy Tent all the time . And at night the cloud looked like fire .
ERV	Numbers	9	17	When the cloud moved from its place over the Holy Tent , the Israelites followed it . When the cloud stopped , that is the place where the Israelites camped .
ERV	Numbers	9	18	This was the way the Lord showed the Israelites when to move and when to stop and set up camp . While the cloud stayed over the Holy Tent , the people continued to camp in that same place .
ERV	Numbers	9	19	Sometimes the cloud would stay over the Holy Tent for a long time . The Israelites obeyed the Lord and did not move .
ERV	Numbers	9	20	Sometimes the cloud was over the Holy Tent for only a few days . So the people obeyed the Lord ’ s command—they followed the cloud when it moved .
ERV	Numbers	9	21	Sometimes the cloud stayed only during the night—the next morning the cloud moved . So the people gathered their things and followed it . If the cloud moved , during the day or during the night , they followed it .
ERV	Numbers	9	22	If the cloud stayed over the Holy Tent for two days , a month , or a year , the people stayed at that place . They did not leave until the cloud moved . When the cloud rose from its place and moved , they also moved .
ERV	Numbers	9	23	So the people obeyed the Lord ’ s commands . They camped when the Lord told them to , and they moved when he told them to . They watched carefully and obeyed the Lord ’ s commands to Moses .
ERV	Numbers	10	10	Also blow these trumpets for your special meetings , New Moon celebrations , and all your happy times together .

ERV	Numbers	10	2	“ Make two trumpets . Use silver and hammer it to make the trumpets . These trumpets will be for calling the people together and for telling them when it is time to move the camp .
ERV	Numbers	10	3	If you blow long blasts on both trumpets , all the people must meet together at the entrance of the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Numbers	10	4	But if you blow long blasts on only one trumpet , only the leaders will come to meet with you . ( These are the leaders of the twelve tribes of Israel . )
ERV	Numbers	10	5	“ Short blasts on the trumpets will be the way to tell the people to move the camp . The first time you blow a short blast on the trumpets , the tribes camping on the east side of the Meeting Tent must begin to move .
ERV	Numbers	10	6	The second time you blow a short blast on the trumpets , the tribes camping on the south side of the Meeting Tent will begin to move .
ERV	Numbers	10	7	But if you want to gather the people together for a special meeting , blow the trumpets in a different way—blow a long steady blast on the trumpets .
ERV	Numbers	10	8	Only Aaron ’ s sons , the priests , should blow the trumpets . This is a law for you that will continue forever , for generations to come .
ERV	Numbers	10	9	“ If you are fighting an enemy in your own land , blow loudly on the trumpets before you go to fight them . The Lord your God will hear you , and he will save you from your enemies .
ERV	Numbers	10	11	On the 20th day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites left Egypt , the cloud rose from above the Tent of the Agreement .
ERV	Numbers	10	12	So the Israelites began their journey . They left the desert of Sinai and traveled until the cloud stopped in the desert of Paran .
ERV	Numbers	10	13	This was the first time the people moved their camp . They moved it the way the Lord commanded Moses .
ERV	Numbers	10	14	The three divisions from Judah ’ s camp went first . They traveled under their flag . The first group was the tribe of Judah . Nahshon son of Amminadab was the commander of that group .

ERV	Numbers	10	21	Then came the Kohath family . They carried the holy things from inside the Holy Tent . These people came at this time so that the other people could set up the Holy Tent and make it ready at the new camp before these people arrived .
ERV	Numbers	10	22	Next came the three groups from Ephraim ’ s camp . They traveled under their flag . The first group was the tribe of Ephraim . Elishama son of Ammihud was the commander of that group .

ERV	Numbers	10	27	Then came the tribe of Naphtali . Ahira son of Enan was the commander of that group .
ERV	Numbers	10	28	That was the way the Israelites marched when they moved from place to place .
ERV	Numbers	10	29	Hobab was the son of Reuel , the Midianite . ( Reuel was Moses ’ father-in-law . ) Moses said to Hobab , “ We are traveling to the land that the Lord promised to give to us . Come with us and we will be good to you . The Lord has promised good things to the Israelites. ”
ERV	Numbers	10	30	But Hobab answered , “ No , I will not go with you . I will go back to my homeland and to my own people. ”
ERV	Numbers	10	31	Then Moses said , “ Please don ’ t leave us . You know more about the desert than we do . You can be our guide .
ERV	Numbers	10	32	If you come with us , we will share with you all the good things that the Lord gives us. ”
ERV	Numbers	10	33	So they began traveling from the mountain of the Lord . The priests took the Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement and walked in front of the people . They carried the Holy Box for three days , looking for a place to camp .
ERV	Numbers	10	34	The Lord ’ s cloud was over them every day . And when they left their camp every morning , the cloud was there to lead them .
ERV	Numbers	10	35	When the people lifted the Holy Box to move the camp , Moses always said , “ Get up , Lord ! May your enemies be scattered . May your enemies run away from you. ”
ERV	Numbers	10	36	And when the Holy Box was put in its place , Moses always said , “ Come back , Lord , to the millions of Israelites. ” Footnotes - Numbers 10:20 Deuel Or “ Reuel . ”
ERV	Numbers	11	11	He asked the Lord , “ Why did you bring this trouble on me ? I am your servant . What did I do wrong ? What did I do to upset you ? Why did you give me responsibility over all these people ?
ERV	Numbers	11	2	So the people cried to Moses for help . He prayed to the Lord and the fire stopped burning .
ERV	Numbers	11	3	So that place was called Taberah . [ a ] The people gave the place that name because the Lord caused a fire to burn in their camp . The
ERV	Numbers	11	70	elders some of the same Spirit that was on Moses . After the Spirit came down on them , they began to prophesy . [ c ] But that was the only time they ever did this .
ERV	Numbers	11	4	The foreigners who had joined the Israelites began wanting other things to eat . Soon all the Israelites began complaining again . The people said , “ We want to eat meat !
ERV	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish we ate in Egypt . That fish cost us nothing . We also had good vegetables like cucumbers , melons , chives , onions , and garlic .
ERV	Numbers	11	6	But now we have lost our strength . We never eat anything—only this manna ! ”
ERV	Numbers	11	7	( The manna was like small coriander seeds , and it looked like sap from a tree .
ERV	Numbers	11	8	The people gathered the manna . Then they used rocks to crush it and cooked it in a pot . Or they ground it into flour and made thin cakes with it . The cakes tasted like sweet cakes cooked with olive oil .
ERV	Numbers	11	9	The manna fell on the ground each night when the ground became wet with dew . )
ERV	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard the people complaining . People from every family were sitting by their tents and complaining . The Lord became very angry , and this made Moses very upset .
ERV	Numbers	11	12	You know that I am not the father of all these people . You know that I did not give birth to them . But I must take care of them , like a nurse carrying a baby in her arms . Why do you force me to do this ? Why do you force me to carry them to the land that you promised to our fathers ?
ERV	Numbers	11	13	I don ’ t have enough meat for all these people ! And they continue complaining to me . They say , ‘ Give us meat to eat ! ’
ERV	Numbers	11	14	I can not take care of all these people alone . The burden is too heavy for me .
ERV	Numbers	11	15	If you plan to continue giving me their troubles , kill me now . If you accept me as your servant , let me die now . Then I will be finished with all my troubles ! ”
ERV	Numbers	11	16	The Lord said to Moses , “ Bring to me
ERV	Numbers	11	17	Then I will come down and speak with you there . The Spirit [ b ] is on you now . But I will also give some of that Spirit to them . Then they will help you take care of the people . In this way you will not have to be responsible for these people alone .
ERV	Numbers	11	18	“ Tell the people this : Make yourselves ready for tomorrow . Tomorrow you will eat meat . The Lord heard you when you cried out and said , ‘ We need meat to eat ! It was better for us in Egypt ! ’ So now the Lord will give you meat . And you will eat it .
ERV	Numbers	11	19	You will eat it for more than one , or two , or five , or ten , or even twenty days !
ERV	Numbers	11	20	You will eat that meat for a whole month until you are sick of it . This will happen to you because you complained against the Lord . He lives among you and knows what you need , but you cried and complained to him ! You said , ‘ Why did we ever leave Egypt ? ’ ”
ERV	Numbers	11	21	Moses said , “ There are 600,000 soldiers here , and you say , ‘ I will give them enough meat to eat for a whole month ! ’
ERV	Numbers	11	22	If we were to kill all the sheep and cattle , that would still not be enough to feed this many people for a month . And if we caught all the fish in the sea , it would not be enough for them ! ”
ERV	Numbers	11	23	But the Lord said to Moses , “ Don ’ t limit my power ! You will see that I can do what I say I can do. ”
ERV	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out to speak with the people . He told them what the Lord said . Then he gathered
ERV	Numbers	11	25	,
ERV	Numbers	11	26	. - Numbers 11:34 Kibroth Hattaavah This name means “ Graves of Strong Desire . ”
ERV	Numbers	11	27	A young man ran and told Moses . The man said , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in camp. ”
ERV	Numbers	11	28	Joshua son of Nun said to Moses , “ Moses , sir , you must stop them ! ” ( Joshua had been Moses ’ helper since Joshua was a boy . )
ERV	Numbers	11	29	. - Numbers 11:25 prophesy Usually this means “ to speak for God. ” But here , it might mean that God ’ s Spirit took control of these men in some special way . Also in verse
ERV	Numbers	11	30	Then Moses and the leaders of Israel went back to the camp . The Quail Come
ERV	Numbers	11	31	Then the Lord made a powerful wind to blow in from the sea , and it blew quail into the area all around the camp . There were so many birds that the ground was covered . They were about three feet deep on the ground . There were quail in every direction as far as a man can walk in one day .
ERV	Numbers	11	32	They went out and gathered quail all that day and all that night . And they gathered quail all the next day too ! The smallest amount anyone gathered was
ERV	Numbers	11	60	bushels . Then the people spread the quail meat all around the camp to dry in the sun .
ERV	Numbers	11	33	People began to eat the meat , but the Lord became very angry . While the meat was still in their mouths , before the people could finish eating it , the Lord caused the people to become very sick and die .
ERV	Numbers	11	34	So the people named that place Kibroth Hattaavah , [ d ] because there they buried those who had the strong desire for meat .
ERV	Numbers	11	35	From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there . Footnotes - Numbers 11:3 Taberah This name means “ burning. ” - Numbers 11:17 Spirit Or “ spirit. ” Also in verses
ERV	Numbers	12	12	Don ’ t let her lose her skin like a baby who is born dead. ” ( Sometimes a baby will be born like that , with half of its skin eaten away . )
ERV	Numbers	12	2	They said to themselves , “ Moses is not the only one the Lord has used to speak to the people . He has also spoken through us ! ” The Lord heard this .
ERV	Numbers	12	3	( Moses was a very humble man . He was more humble than any other man on earth . )
ERV	Numbers	12	4	So suddenly , the Lord came and spoke to Moses , Aaron , and Miriam . He said , “ You three , come to the Meeting Tent , now ! ” So Moses , Aaron , and Miriam went to the Tent .
ERV	Numbers	12	5	The Lord came down in the tall cloud and stood at the entrance to the Tent . He called out , “ Aaron and Miriam ! ” They went to him .
ERV	Numbers	12	6	God said , “ Listen to me ! You will have prophets . I , the Lord , will let them learn about me through visions . I will speak to them in dreams .
ERV	Numbers	12	7	But Moses is not like that . He is my faithful servant—I trust him with everyone in my house .
ERV	Numbers	12	8	When I speak to him , I talk face to face with him . I don ’ t use stories with hidden meanings—I show him clearly what I want him to know . And Moses can look at the very image of the Lord . So why were you brave enough to speak against my servant Moses ? ”
ERV	Numbers	12	9	The Lord was very angry with them , and he left them .
ERV	Numbers	12	10	The cloud rose from the Tent . Aaron turned and looked at Miriam . Her skin was white like snow—she had a terrible skin disease !
ERV	Numbers	12	11	Then Aaron said to Moses , “ Please , sir , forgive us for the foolish sin that we did .
ERV	Numbers	12	13	So Moses prayed to the Lord , “ God , please heal her from this sickness ! ”
ERV	Numbers	12	14	The Lord answered Moses , “ If her father spit in her face , she would be shamed for seven days . So put her outside the camp for seven days . After that she can come back into the camp. ”
ERV	Numbers	12	15	So they took Miriam outside the camp for seven days . And the people did not move from that place until she was brought in again .
ERV	Numbers	12	16	After that the people left Hazeroth and traveled to the desert of Paran where they set up camp . Footnotes - Numbers 12:1 Ethiopian Or “ Cushite , ” a person from Ethiopia , in Africa .

ERV	Numbers	13	2	“ Send some men to explore the land of Canaan . I will give this land to the Israelites . Send one leader from each of the twelve tribes. ”
ERV	Numbers	13	3	So Moses obeyed the Lord ’ s command and sent out the Israelite leaders while the people were camped in the desert of Paran .
ERV	Numbers	13	4	These are their names : from the tribe of Reuben—Shammua son of Zaccur ;

ERV	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men Moses sent to look at and study the land . ( Moses called Hoshea son of Nun by another name . Moses called him Joshua . )
ERV	Numbers	13	17	When Moses was sending them out to explore Canaan , he said , “ Go through the Negev and then into the hill country .
ERV	Numbers	13	18	See what the land looks like . Learn about the people who live there . Are they strong or are they weak ? Are they few or are they many ?
ERV	Numbers	13	19	Learn about the land that they live in . Is it good land or bad land ? What kind of towns do they live in ? Do the towns have walls protecting them ? Are the towns strongly defended ?
ERV	Numbers	13	20	And learn other things about the land . Is the soil good for growing things , or is it poor soil ? Are there trees on the land ? Try to bring back some of the fruit from that land. ” ( This was during the time when the first grapes should be ripe . )
ERV	Numbers	13	21	So they went to explore the country . They explored the area from the desert of Zin to Rehob and Lebo Hamath .
ERV	Numbers	13	22	They entered the country through the Negev and went to Hebron . ( The town of Hebron was built seven years before the town of Zoan in Egypt . ) Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai lived there . These men were descendants of Anak .
ERV	Numbers	13	23	Then the men went to Eshcol Valley . There they cut off a branch from a grapevine that had a bunch of grapes on it . They put that branch on a pole , and two men carried it between them . They also carried some pomegranates and figs .
ERV	Numbers	13	24	That place is called the Eshcol [ b ] Valley , because there the men of Israel cut off the bunch of grapes .
ERV	Numbers	13	25	The men explored that country for
ERV	Numbers	13	40	days , and then they went back to the camp .
ERV	Numbers	13	26	The Israelites were camped near Kadesh , in the desert of Paran . The men went to Moses and Aaron and all the Israelites . They told Moses , Aaron , and all the people what they saw and showed them the fruit from the land .
ERV	Numbers	13	27	The men told Moses , “ We went to the land where you sent us . It is a land filled with many good things [ c ] ! Here is some of the fruit that grows there .
ERV	Numbers	13	28	But the people living there are very powerful . The cities are very large and strongly defended . We even saw some Anakites there .
ERV	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites live in the Negev . The Hittites , Jebusites , and Amorites live in the hill country . The Canaanites live near the sea and by the Jordan River. ”
ERV	Numbers	13	30	Caleb told the people near Moses to be quiet . Then Caleb said , “ We should go up and take that land for ourselves . We can easily take that land. ”
ERV	Numbers	13	31	But the men who had gone with him said , “ We can not fight those people ! They are much stronger than we are. ”
ERV	Numbers	13	32	So those men gave a report that discouraged the people . They said , “ The land we saw is full of strong people . They are strong enough to easily defeat anyone who goes there .

Those people know about the special cloud . They know you use the cloud to lead your people during the day . And they know the cloud becomes a fire to lead your people at night .
ERV	Numbers	14	2	The Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron . All the people came together and said to Moses and Aaron , “ We should have died in Egypt or in the desert .
ERV	Numbers	14	3	Did the Lord bring us to this new land to be killed in war ? The enemy will kill us and take our wives and children ! It would be better for us to go back to Egypt. ”
ERV	Numbers	14	4	Then the people said to each other , “ Let ’ s choose another leader and go back to Egypt. ”
ERV	Numbers	14	5	Moses and Aaron bowed low to the ground in front of all the people gathered there .
ERV	Numbers	14	6	Joshua and Caleb became very upset . ( Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh were two of the men who explored the land . )
ERV	Numbers	14	7	These two men said to all the Israelites gathered there , “ The land that we saw is very good .
ERV	Numbers	14	8	It is a land filled with many good things . If the Lord is pleased with us , he will lead us into that land . And he will give that land to us .
ERV	Numbers	14	9	So don ’ t turn against the Lord ! Don ’ t be afraid of the people in that land . We can defeat them . They have no protection , nothing to keep them safe . But we have the Lord with us , so don ’ t be afraid ! ”
ERV	Numbers	14	10	All the people began talking about killing Joshua and Caleb with stones . But the Glory of the Lord appeared over the Meeting Tent where all the people could see it .
ERV	Numbers	14	11	The Lord spoke to Moses and said , “ How long will these people continue to turn against me ? They show that they don ’ t trust me or believe in my power , in spite of the many miracles I have done among them .
ERV	Numbers	14	12	I will kill them all with a terrible sickness . I will destroy them , and I will use you to make another nation . Your nation will be greater and stronger than these people. ”
ERV	Numbers	14	13	Then Moses said to the Lord , “ If you do that , the Egyptians will hear about it ! They know that you used your great power to bring your people out of Egypt .
ERV	Numbers	14	15	So you must not kill these people now . If you kill them , all the nations who have heard about your power will say ,
ERV	Numbers	14	16	‘ The Lord was not able to bring them into the land he promised them . So he killed them in the desert. ’
ERV	Numbers	14	17	“ So now , Lord , show your strength ! Show it the way you said you would .
ERV	Numbers	14	18	You said , ‘ The Lord is slow to become angry . He is full of great love . He forgives [ a ] those who are guilty and break the law . But he always punishes those who are guilty . He punishes them , and he also punishes their children , their grandchildren , and even their great-grandchildren for those bad things. ’

ERV	Numbers	14	21	But I tell you the truth . As surely as I live and as surely as the Glory of the Lord fills the whole earth , I make you this promise :
ERV	Numbers	14	22	None of the people I led out of Egypt will ever see the land of Canaan . They saw my glory and the great signs that I did in Egypt and in the desert . But they disobeyed me and tested me ten times .
ERV	Numbers	14	23	I promised their ancestors that I would give them that land . But none of those people who turned against me will ever enter that land !
ERV	Numbers	14	24	But my servant Caleb was different . He follows me completely . So I will bring him into the land that he has already seen , and his people will get that land .
ERV	Numbers	14	25	The Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valley . So tomorrow you must leave this place . Go back to the desert on the road to the Red Sea. ” The Lord Punishes the People
ERV	Numbers	14	26	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
ERV	Numbers	14	27	“ How long will these evil people continue to complain against me ? I have heard their complaints and their griping .
ERV	Numbers	14	28	So tell them , ‘ The Lord says that he will surely do all those things to you that you complained about . This is what will happen to you :
ERV	Numbers	14	29	You will die in this desert . Every person who is
ERV	Numbers	14	30	So none of you will ever enter and live in the land that I promised to give you . Only Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun will enter that land .
ERV	Numbers	14	31	You were afraid and complained that your enemies in that new land would take your children away from you . But I tell you that I will bring them into the land . They will enjoy what you refused to accept .
ERV	Numbers	14	32	As for you people , you will die in this desert .

ERV	Numbers	14	35	“ I am the Lord , and I have spoken . And I promise that I will do these things to all these evil people . They have come together against me . So they will all die here in this desert. ”
ERV	Numbers	14	36	The men Moses sent to explore the new land were the ones who came back complaining about him to all the Israelites . They said that the people were not strong enough to enter that land .
ERV	Numbers	14	37	The men were responsible for spreading the trouble among the Israelites . So the Lord caused a sickness to kill all those men .
ERV	Numbers	14	38	But Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh were among the men who were sent out to explore the land . They are the only ones who did not get the sickness that caused the others to die . The People Try to Go Into Canaan
ERV	Numbers	14	39	When Moses told the Israelites this , they were very sad .
ERV	Numbers	14	41	But Moses said , “ Why are you not obeying the Lord ’ s command ? You will not be successful !
ERV	Numbers	14	42	Don ’ t go into that land . The Lord is not with you , so your enemies will easily defeat you .
ERV	Numbers	14	43	The Amalekites and Canaanites will fight against you there . You have turned away from the Lord , so he will not be with you when you fight them . And you will all be killed in battle. ”
ERV	Numbers	14	44	But the people did not believe Moses . They went toward the high hill country . But Moses and the Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement did not go with the people .

ERV	Numbers	15	18	“ Tell the Israelites this : I am taking you to another land .
ERV	Numbers	15	19	When you eat the food that grows in that land , you must give part of that food as an offering to the Lord .
ERV	Numbers	15	20	You will gather grain and grind it into flour to make dough for bread . You must give the first bread from that flour as a gift to the Lord . It will be like the grain offering that comes from the threshing floor .
ERV	Numbers	15	21	You and all your descendants must give part of the first dough you make from that flour as a gift to the Lord .
ERV	Numbers	15	22	“ As you try to obey all the commands that the Lord gave Moses , you might fail and make a mistake .
ERV	Numbers	15	23	The Lord gave you those commands through Moses , and they have been in effect from the day they were given throughout the generations until today .
ERV	Numbers	15	25	“ So the priest will make the whole community of Israel pure , and they will be forgiven for the mistake they made . Since they made the mistake , they must bring a gift and a sin offering to the Lord .
ERV	Numbers	15	26	Then the whole community of Israel and any foreigners among them will be forgiven for the mistake .
ERV	Numbers	15	27	“ But if only one person makes a mistake and sins , that person must bring a female goat that is one year old . That goat will be the sin offering .
ERV	Numbers	15	28	The priest will make purification before the Lord for the one who sinned , and that person will be forgiven .
ERV	Numbers	15	29	This law is for everyone who makes a mistake and sins . The same law is for the people born in the family of Israel and for the foreigners living among you .
ERV	Numbers	15	30	“ If someone sins and knows they are doing wrong , they are rebelling against the Lord . They must be separated from their people . The same law applies to citizens of Israel and to foreigners living among you .
ERV	Numbers	15	31	They thought the Lord ’ s word was not important , so they broke his commands . That is why they must be separated from their people—they must bear the responsibility for their guilt. ” A Man Works on the Day of Rest
ERV	Numbers	15	32	While the Israelites were in the desert , some of them saw a man gathering firewood on the Sabbath day .
ERV	Numbers	15	33	The people who saw him gathering the wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole community of Israel .
ERV	Numbers	15	34	They guarded the man carefully because they did not know how they should punish him .
ERV	Numbers	15	35	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ The man must die . All the people must throw stones at him outside the camp. ”
ERV	Numbers	15	36	So the people took him outside the camp and killed him with stones . They did this just as the Lord commanded Moses . A Way to Remember God ’ s Commands
ERV	Numbers	15	37	The Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	15	38	“ Speak to the Israelites . Tell them this : Tie several pieces of thread together and tie them in the corner of your clothes . Put a piece of blue thread in each one of these tassels . You must wear these things now and forever .
ERV	Numbers	15	39	You will be able to look at these tassels and remember all the commands that the Lord has given you . Then you will obey the commands . You will not do wrong by forgetting about the commands and doing the things that your own bodies and eyes want .
ERV	Numbers	15	40	You will remember to obey all my commands . Then you will be God ’ s special people .
ERV	Numbers	15	41	I am the Lord your God . I am the one who brought you out of Egypt . I did this to be your God . I am the Lord your God. ” Footnotes - Numbers 15:4
ERV	Numbers	16	16	Then Moses said to Korah , “ You and all your followers will stand before the Lord tomorrow . Aaron will also be there with you and your followers .
ERV	Numbers	16	2	These four men gathered
ERV	Numbers	16	250	men who were offering the incense .
ERV	Numbers	16	3	They came as a group to speak against Moses and Aaron and said , “ You have gone too far—you are wrong ! All the Israelites are holy—the Lord still lives among them . You are making yourselves more important than the rest of the Lord ’ s people. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he bowed his face to the ground to show he was not being proud .
ERV	Numbers	16	5	Then Moses said to Korah and all his followers , “ Tomorrow morning the Lord will show who belongs to him . He will show who is holy , and he will bring that man near to him . He will choose him and bring that man near to him .
ERV	Numbers	16	6	So Korah , you and all your followers should do this :
ERV	Numbers	16	7	Tomorrow put fire and incense in some special pans . Then bring those pans before the Lord . He will choose the man who is holy . You Levites have gone too far—you are wrong ! ”
ERV	Numbers	16	8	Moses also said to Korah , “ You Levites , listen to me .
ERV	Numbers	16	9	You should be happy that the God of Israel chose you to be different from the rest of the Israelites . He lets you come near to him to do the special work in the Lord ’ s Holy Tent to help the Israelites worship him . Isn ’ t that enough ?
ERV	Numbers	16	10	He brought you Levites near to him to help the priests , but now you are trying to become priests also .
ERV	Numbers	16	11	You and your followers have joined together and turned against the Lord ! Did Aaron do anything wrong ? No , so why are you complaining against Aaron ? ”
ERV	Numbers	16	12	Then Moses called Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab . But the two men said , “ We will not come !
ERV	Numbers	16	13	You have brought us out of a land filled with many good things . [ a ] You brought us to the desert to kill us . And now you want to show that you have even more power over us .
ERV	Numbers	16	14	Why should we follow you ? You did not bring us into the new land filled with many good things . You did not give us the land God promised . You did not give us the fields or the vineyards . Will you make these men your slaves ? No ! We will not come. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	15	So Moses became very angry . He said to the Lord , “ I never did anything wrong to these people . I never took anything from them—not even a donkey ! Don ’ t accept their gifts ! ”
ERV	Numbers	16	17	Each of you must bring a pan , put incense in it , and present it to the Lord . There will be
ERV	Numbers	16	18	So each man got a pan and put burning incense in it . Then they stood at the entrance of the Meeting Tent . Moses and Aaron also stood there .
ERV	Numbers	16	19	Korah also gathered all the people together at the entrance of the Meeting Tent . Then the Glory of the Lord appeared to everyone there .
ERV	Numbers	16	20	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
ERV	Numbers	16	21	“ Move away from these men ! I want to destroy them now ! ”
ERV	Numbers	16	22	But Moses and Aaron bowed to the ground and cried out , “ God , you know what people are thinking . [ b ] Please don ’ t be angry with all these people . Only one man really sinned. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	23	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	16	24	“ Tell the people to move away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	25	Moses stood and went to Dathan and Abiram . All the elders of Israel followed him .
ERV	Numbers	16	26	Moses warned the people , “ Move away from the tents of these evil men . Don ’ t touch anything that belongs to them ! If you do , you will be destroyed because of their sins. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	27	So the men moved away from the tents of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram . Dathan and Abiram went to their tents . They stood outside of their tents with their wives , children , and little babies .
ERV	Numbers	16	28	Then Moses said , “ I will show you proof that the Lord sent me to do all the things I told you . I will show you that all these things were not my own idea .
ERV	Numbers	16	29	These men will die , but if they die in a normal way—the way people always die—then that will show that the Lord did not really send me .
ERV	Numbers	16	30	But if the Lord causes them to die in a different way , then you will know that these men have sinned against the Lord . This is the proof : The earth will open and swallow them . They will go down to their grave still alive . And everything that belongs to these men will go down with them. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	31	When Moses finished saying these things , the ground under the men opened .
ERV	Numbers	16	32	It was as if the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them . All of Korah ’ s men , their families , and everything they owned went down into the earth .
ERV	Numbers	16	33	They went down into their grave alive . Everything they owned went with them . Then the earth closed over them . They were finished—gone from the camp !
ERV	Numbers	16	34	The Israelites heard the cries of the men being destroyed . So they all ran in different directions and said , “ The earth will swallow us too ! ”
ERV	Numbers	16	35	Then a fire came from the Lord and destroyed the
ERV	Numbers	16	36	The Lord said to Moses , 37-38 “ Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to get all the incense pans from the fire . Tell him to scatter the coals and ashes . These men sinned against me , and their sin cost them their lives . But the incense pans are still holy . The pans became holy when people gave them to the Lord . Hammer the pans into flat sheets . Use the metal sheets to cover the altar . This will be a warning to all the Israelites. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	39	So Eleazar the priest gathered together all the bronze pans that the men had brought . These men were all burned up , but the pans were still there . Then Eleazar told some men to hammer the pans into flat metal . Then he put the metal sheets on the altar .
ERV	Numbers	16	40	He did this the way the Lord commanded him through Moses . This was a sign to help the Israelites remember that only someone from the family of Aaron should burn incense before the Lord . Any other person who burns incense before the Lord will die like Korah and his followers . Aaron Saves the People
ERV	Numbers	16	41	The next day all the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron . They said , “ You killed the Lord ’ s people. ”
ERV	Numbers	16	42	Moses and Aaron were standing at the entrance of the Meeting Tent . The people gathered together at that place to complain against Moses and Aaron . But when they looked toward the Meeting Tent , the cloud covered it and the Glory of the Lord appeared there .
ERV	Numbers	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Numbers	16	44	The Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	16	45	“ Move away from these people so that I can destroy them now. ” So Moses and Aaron bowed with their faces to the ground .
ERV	Numbers	16	46	Then Moses said to Aaron , “ Get your bronze pan and some fire from the altar . Then put incense in it . Hurry to the people and do the things that will make them pure . The Lord is angry with them . The trouble has already started. ” 47-48 So Aaron got the incense and the fire , and he ran to the middle of the people . But the sickness had already started among them . So Aaron stood between the dead and those who were still alive . He did what Moses said to remove their sin , and the sickness stopped there .
ERV	Numbers	16	49	But 14,700 people died from that sickness—and that is not counting the people who died because of Korah .
ERV	Numbers	16	50	So the terrible sickness was stopped , and Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance of the Meeting Tent .

ERV	Numbers	17	17	The Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	17	2	“ Speak to the Israelites . Get twelve wooden walking sticks from them . Get one from the leader of each of the twelve tribes . Write the name of each man on his walking stick .
ERV	Numbers	17	3	On the stick from Levi , write Aaron ’ s name . There must be one stick for the head of each of the twelve tribes .
ERV	Numbers	17	4	Put these walking sticks in the Meeting Tent in front of the Box of the Agreement . This is the place where I meet with you .
ERV	Numbers	17	5	I will choose one man to be the true priest . You will know which man I choose because his walking stick will begin to grow new leaves . In this way I will stop the people from always complaining against you and me. ”
ERV	Numbers	17	6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites . Each of the leaders gave him a walking stick . There were twelve walking sticks . There was one stick from each leader of each tribe . One of the walking sticks belonged to Aaron .
ERV	Numbers	17	7	Moses put the walking sticks before the Lord in the Tent of the Agreement .
ERV	Numbers	17	8	The next day Moses entered the Tent . He saw that Aaron ’ s walking stick , the stick from the family of Levi , was the one that had grown new leaves . That walking stick had even grown branches and made almonds .
ERV	Numbers	17	9	So Moses brought out all the sticks from the Lord ’ s place . He showed the walking sticks to the Israelites . They all looked at the sticks , and each man took his own stick back .
ERV	Numbers	17	10	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Put Aaron ’ s walking stick back in front of the Box that holds the Agreement . [ a ] This will be a warning for these people who are always turning against me . This will stop their complaining against me so that I will not destroy them. ”
ERV	Numbers	17	11	So Moses did what the Lord commanded him .
ERV	Numbers	17	12	The Israelites said to Moses , “ We know that we will die ! We are lost ! We will all be destroyed !
ERV	Numbers	17	13	Anyone who even comes near the Lord ’ s holy place will die . Is it true that we will all die ? ” Footnotes - Numbers 17:10 Box that holds the Agreement Literally , “ Testimony. ” See “ Agreement ” in the Word List .

ERV	Numbers	18	6	I myself chose the Levites from among all the Israelites . They are as a gift to you . I gave them to you to serve the Lord and work in the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Numbers	18	7	But , Aaron , only you and your sons may serve as priests . You are the only ones who can go near the altar or behind the curtain into the Most Holy Place . I am giving you a gift—your service as a priest . Anyone else who tries to come too close must be killed. ”
ERV	Numbers	18	8	Then the Lord said to Aaron , “ I myself gave you responsibility over all the special gifts people give to me . All the holy gifts that the Israelites give to me , I give to you . You and your sons can share in these gifts . They will always belong to you .
ERV	Numbers	18	9	The people will bring gifts , grain offerings , sin offerings , and guilt offerings . These offerings are most holy . Your share in the most holy offerings will come from the parts that are not burned . All these things will be for you and your sons .
ERV	Numbers	18	10	Eat these things only in a very holy place . Every male in your family may eat them , but you must remember that these offerings are holy .
ERV	Numbers	18	11	“ The Israelites will bring special gifts that you will lift up to me . I give these gifts to you and your sons and daughters . That is your share . Everyone in your family who is clean will be able to eat it .
ERV	Numbers	18	12	“ And I give you all the best olive oil and all the best new wine and grain . These are the things that the Israelites give to me , the Lord . These are the first things that they gather in their harvest .
ERV	Numbers	18	13	When the people gather a harvest , they bring all the first things to the Lord . So these things I will give to you . And everyone in your family who is clean may eat it .
ERV	Numbers	18	14	“ Anything in Israel that is a special gift to God [ a ] is yours .
ERV	Numbers	18	15	“ A woman ’ s first baby and an animal ’ s first baby must be given to the Lord . That baby will belong to you . If the firstborn animal is unclean , then it must be bought back . If the baby is a child , that child must be bought back .

It is an agreement with the Lord that can not be broken . [ d ] I make this promise to you and to your descendants. ”
ERV	Numbers	18	21	“ The Israelites will give one-tenth of everything they have . So I give that one-tenth to the Levites . This is their payment for the work that they do while they serve at the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Numbers	18	22	But the other Israelites must never go near that Meeting Tent . If they do , they must be put to death !
ERV	Numbers	18	23	The Levites will do the work of caring for the Meeting Tent . They must bear the responsibility for anything done against it . This is a law that will continue forever . The Levites will not get any of the land that I promised to the other Israelites .
ERV	Numbers	18	24	But the Israelites will give one-tenth of everything they have to the Lord , and I will give that one-tenth to the Levites . That is why I said these words about the Levites : They will not get the land that I promised the Israelites. ”
ERV	Numbers	18	25	The Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	18	26	“ Speak to the Levites and tell them : The Israelites will give one-tenth of everything they own to the Lord . That one-tenth will belong to the Levites . But you must give one-tenth of that to the Lord as your offering .
ERV	Numbers	18	27	That tenth will be your offering to the Lord . It will be like grain from your own threshing floor or wine from your own winepress .
ERV	Numbers	18	28	In this way you will also give an offering to the Lord just as the other Israelites do . You will get the one-tenth that the Israelites give to the Lord , and then you will give one-tenth of that to Aaron the priest .
ERV	Numbers	18	29	When the Israelites give you one-tenth of everything that they own , then you must give the best and the holiest part of these things as your gift to the Lord .

ERV	Numbers	18	31	You and your families can eat all that is left . This is your payment for the work you do in the Meeting Tent .

ERV	Numbers	19	2	“ These are the laws from the teachings that the Lord gave to the Israelites . Get a red cow that has nothing wrong with it . That cow must not have any bruises . And it must never have worn a yoke .
ERV	Numbers	19	3	Give that cow to Eleazar , and he will take it outside the camp and kill it there .
ERV	Numbers	19	4	Then Eleazar the priest must put some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle some of the blood toward the Holy Tent . He must do this seven times .
ERV	Numbers	19	5	Then the whole cow must be burned in front of him ; the skin , the meat , the blood , and the intestines must all be burned .
ERV	Numbers	19	6	Then the priest must take a cedar stick , a hyssop branch , and some red string . He must throw these things into the fire where the cow is burning .
ERV	Numbers	19	7	Then the priest must wash himself and his clothes with water . Then he must come back into the camp . He will be unclean until evening .

ERV	Numbers	19	13	Those who touch the body of someone who has died are unclean . If they stay unclean and then go to the Lord ’ s Holy Tent , they make it unclean . So they must be separated from the Israelites . Because the special water was not thrown on them , they remain unclean .
ERV	Numbers	19	14	“ This is the rule about those who die in their tents : If someone dies in the tent , everyone in the tent will be unclean for seven days .
ERV	Numbers	19	15	And every jar or pot without a lid becomes unclean .

ERV	Numbers	20	2	There was not enough water for the people at that place . So the people met together to complain against Moses and Aaron .
ERV	Numbers	20	3	The people argued with Moses and said , “ Maybe we should have died in front of the Lord like our brothers did .
ERV	Numbers	20	4	Why did you bring the Lord ’ s people into this desert ? Do you want us and our animals to die here ?
ERV	Numbers	20	5	Why did you bring us from Egypt ? Why did you bring us to this bad place ? There is no grain . There are no figs , grapes , or pomegranates , and there is no water to drink. ”
ERV	Numbers	20	6	So Moses and Aaron left the crowd of people and went to the entrance of the Meeting Tent . They bowed down to the ground , and the Glory of the Lord appeared to them .
ERV	Numbers	20	7	The Lord spoke to Moses and said ,
ERV	Numbers	20	8	“ Get the special walking stick . Take your brother Aaron and the crowd of people and go to that rock . Speak to the rock in front of the people . Then water will flow from the rock , and you can give that water to the people and to their animals. ”

ERV	Numbers	20	10	Moses and Aaron told the people to meet together in front of the rock . Then Moses said , “ You people are always complaining . Now listen to me . I will cause water to flow from this rock. ”
ERV	Numbers	20	11	Moses lifted his arm and hit the rock twice . Water began flowing from the rock , and the people and their animals drank that water .
ERV	Numbers	20	12	But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron , “ You did not trust me enough to honor me and show the people that I am holy . You did not show the Israelites that the power to make the water came from me . So you will not lead the people into the land that I have given them. ”
ERV	Numbers	20	13	This place was called the waters of Meribah . [ a ] This is where the Israelites argued with the Lord and where he showed them that he was holy . Edom Will Not Let Israel Pass
ERV	Numbers	20	14	While Moses was at Kadesh , he sent some men with a message to the king of Edom . The message said , “ This is what your brothers , the Israelites , say to you : You know about all the troubles we have had .
ERV	Numbers	20	15	Many years ago our ancestors went down into Egypt , and we lived there for many years . The people of Egypt were cruel to us .
ERV	Numbers	20	16	But we asked the Lord for help , and he heard us and sent an angel to help us . The Lord has brought us out of Egypt . “ Now we are here at Kadesh , where your land begins .

ERV	Numbers	20	18	But the king of Edom answered , “ You may not travel through our land . If you try to travel through our land , we will come and fight you with swords. ”
ERV	Numbers	20	19	The Israelites answered , “ We will travel along the main road . If our animals drink any of your water , we will pay you for it . We only want to walk through your country . We don ’ t want to take it for ourselves. ”
ERV	Numbers	20	21	The king of Edom refused to let the Israelites travel through his country , so the Israelites turned around and went another way . Aaron Dies
ERV	Numbers	20	22	All the Israelites traveled from Kadesh to Mount Hor .
ERV	Numbers	20	23	Mount Hor was near the border of Edom . The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
ERV	Numbers	20	24	“ It is time for Aaron to die and go to be with his ancestors . Aaron will not enter the land that I promised to the Israelites . Moses , I say this to you because both you and Aaron did not fully obey the command I gave you at the waters of Meribah .

ERV	Numbers	21	21	The Israelites sent some men to King Sihon of the Amorites . The men said to the king ,

ERV	Numbers	21	3	The Lord listened to the Israelites and helped them defeat the Canaanites . They completely destroyed the Canaanites and their cities . So that place was named Hormah . [ a ] The Bronze Snake
ERV	Numbers	21	4	The Israelites left Mount Hor and traveled on the road that goes to the Red Sea . They did this to go around the country of Edom . But the people became impatient .
ERV	Numbers	21	5	They began complaining against God and Moses . The people said , “ Why did you bring us out of Egypt ? We will die here in the desert ! There is no bread and no water ! And we hate this terrible food ! ”
ERV	Numbers	21	6	So the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people . The snakes bit the people , and many of the Israelites died .
ERV	Numbers	21	7	The people came to Moses and said , “ We know that we sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you . Pray to the Lord . Ask him to take away these snakes. ” So Moses prayed for them .
ERV	Numbers	21	8	The Lord said to Moses , “ Make a bronze snake and put it on a pole . If anyone is bitten by a snake , that person should look at the bronze snake on the pole . Then that person will not die. ”

ERV	Numbers	21	23	But King Sihon would not allow the Israelites to travel through his country . He gathered together his army and marched out to the desert to fight against the Israelites . The king ’ s army fought against the Israelites at Jahaz .
ERV	Numbers	21	24	But the Israelites defeated the king and took his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River . The Israelites took the land as far as the Ammonite border . They stopped at that border because it was strongly defended by the Ammonites .
ERV	Numbers	21	25	Israel took all the Amorite cities and began living in them . They even defeated the city of Heshbon and all the small towns around it .
ERV	Numbers	21	26	Heshbon was the city where Sihon , the Amorite king , lived . In the past Sihon had fought with the king of Moab . Sihon had taken the land as far as the Arnon River .
ERV	Numbers	21	27	That is why the singers sing this song : “ Go in and rebuild Heshbon ! Make Sihon ’ s city strong .
ERV	Numbers	21	28	A fire began in Heshbon . That fire began in Sihon ’ s city . The fire destroyed Ar in Moab . It burned the hills above Arnon River .
ERV	Numbers	21	29	It is bad for you , Moab . You lost Chemosh ’ s people . His sons ran away . His daughters were taken prisoners by Sihon , king of the Amorites .
ERV	Numbers	21	30	But we defeated those Amorites . We destroyed their towns from Heshbon to Dibon , from Nashim to Nophah , near Medeba. ”
ERV	Numbers	21	31	So the Israelites made their camp in the land of the Amorites .
ERV	Numbers	21	32	Moses sent some men to look at the town of Jazer . Then the Israelites captured that town and the small towns that were around it . They forced the Amorites who were living there to leave .
ERV	Numbers	21	33	Then the Israelites traveled on the road toward Bashan . King Og of Bashan got his army and marched out to meet the Israelites . He fought against them at Edrei .
ERV	Numbers	21	34	But the Lord said to Moses , “ Don ’ t be afraid of that king . I will allow you to defeat him . You will take his whole army and all his land . Do the same to him as you did to Sihon , the Amorite king who lived in Heshbon. ”
ERV	Numbers	21	35	So the Israelites defeated Og and his army . They killed him , his sons , and all his army . Then the Israelites took all his land .

ERV	Numbers	22	22	Balaam was riding on his donkey . Two of his servants were with him . While Balaam was traveling , God became angry . So the Lord ’ s angel stood in the road in front of Balaam to stop [ d ] him .
ERV	Numbers	22	4	The king of Moab said to the leaders of Midian , “ This large group of people will destroy everything around us , the way an ox eats all the grass in a field. ” Balak son of Zippor was the king of Moab at this time .
ERV	Numbers	22	5	He sent some men to Balaam son of Beor . Balaam was at Pethor , near the Euphrates River . This was where Balaam ’ s people lived . [ a ] This was Balak ’ s message : “ A new nation of people has come out of Egypt . There are so many people that they cover all the land . They have camped next to me .
ERV	Numbers	22	6	Come and help me . These people are too powerful for me . I know that you have great power . If you bless people , good things happen to them . And if you curse people , bad things happen to them . So come and curse these people . Maybe then I will be able to defeat them and force them to leave my country. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	7	The leaders of Moab and Midian left . They went to talk to Balaam . They carried with them money to pay him for his service . [ b ] Then they told him what Balak had said .
ERV	Numbers	22	8	Balaam said to them , “ Stay here for the night . I will talk to the Lord and tell you the answer he gives me. ” So the leaders of Moab stayed there with Balaam that night .
ERV	Numbers	22	9	God came to Balaam and asked , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
ERV	Numbers	22	10	Balaam said to God , “ The king of Moab , Balak son of Zippor , sent them to give me a message .
ERV	Numbers	22	11	This is the message : A new nation of people has come out of Egypt . There are so many people that they cover the land . So come and curse these people . Then maybe I will be able to fight them and force them to leave my land. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	12	But God said to Balaam , “ Don ’ t go with them . You must not curse those people . They are my people. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	13	The next morning Balaam got up and said to leaders from Balak , “ Go back to your own country . The Lord will not let me go with you. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	14	So the leaders of Moab went back to Balak and told him this . They said , “ Balaam refused to come with us. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	15	So Balak sent other leaders to Balaam . This time he sent many more than the first time . And these leaders were much more important than the first ones he sent .
ERV	Numbers	22	16	They went to Balaam and said , “ This is what Balak son of Zippor says to you : Please don ’ t let anything stop you from coming .
ERV	Numbers	22	17	I will pay you very much , [ c ] and I will do whatever you ask . Come and curse these people for me. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	18	Balaam gave Balak ’ s officials his answer . He said , “ I must obey the Lord my God . I can not do anything , great or small , against his command . Even if King Balak gives me his beautiful home filled with silver and gold , I will not do anything against the Lord ’ s command .
ERV	Numbers	22	19	But you can stay here tonight like the other men did , and during the night I will learn what the Lord wants to tell me. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	20	That night , God came to Balaam . God said , “ These men have come again to ask you to go with them . So you can go with them . But do only what I tell you to do. ” Balaam and His Donkey
ERV	Numbers	22	21	The next morning , Balaam got up , put a saddle on his donkey , and went with the Moabite leaders .
ERV	Numbers	22	23	When Balaam ’ s donkey saw the Lord ’ s angel standing in the road with a sword in his hand , the donkey turned from the road and went into the field . Balaam could not see the angel , so he was very angry at the donkey . He hit the donkey and forced it to go back on the road .
ERV	Numbers	22	24	Later , the Lord ’ s angel stood at a place where the road became narrow . This was between two vineyards . There were walls on both sides of the road .
ERV	Numbers	22	25	Again the donkey saw the Lord ’ s angel . So the donkey walked very close to one wall . This crushed Balaam ’ s foot against the wall . So Balaam hit his donkey again .
ERV	Numbers	22	26	Later , the Lord ’ s angel stood at another place where the road became narrow . There was no place where the donkey could go around him . It could not turn to the left or to the right .
ERV	Numbers	22	27	The donkey saw the Lord ’ s angel . So the donkey lay down with Balaam sitting on top of it . Balaam was very angry at the donkey . So he hit it with his walking stick .
ERV	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord caused the donkey to speak . The donkey said to Balaam , “ Why are you angry at me ? What have I done to you ? You have hit me three times ! ”
ERV	Numbers	22	29	Balaam answered the donkey , “ You have made me look foolish . If I had a sword in my hand , I would kill you right now ! ”
ERV	Numbers	22	30	But the donkey said to Balaam , “ Look , I am your donkey . You have ridden me for so many years . And you know that I have never done this to you before ! ” “ That is true , ” Balaam said .
ERV	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord allowed Balaam to see the angel . The Lord ’ s angel was standing in the road , holding a sword in his hand . Balaam bowed low to the ground .
ERV	Numbers	22	32	. - Numbers 22:32 But just in time Or “ You should not be going this way , ” or “ You are not doing right. ” The Hebrew text here is hard to understand . - Numbers 22:36 Moabite town Or possibly , “ Ar Moab . ”
ERV	Numbers	22	33	your donkey saw me and turned away from me . That happened three times . If the donkey had not turned away , I probably would have killed you already . And I would have let your donkey live. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	34	Then Balaam said to the Lord ’ s angel , “ I have sinned . I did not know that you were standing in the road . If I am doing wrong , I will go back home. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	35	Then the Lord ’ s angel said to Balaam , “ No , you can go with these men . But be careful . Speak only the words that I will tell you to say. ” So Balaam went with the leaders that Balak had sent .
ERV	Numbers	22	36	Balak heard that Balaam was coming . So Balak went out to meet him at the Moabite town [ f ] near the Arnon River . This was at the northern border of his country .
ERV	Numbers	22	37	When Balak saw Balaam , he said to him , “ I asked you before to come . I told you it was very important . Why didn ’ t you come to me ? Did you think I might not be able to pay you ? ”
ERV	Numbers	22	38	Balaam answered , “ Well , I am here now . I came , but I might not be able to do what you asked . I can only say the words God tells me to say. ”
ERV	Numbers	22	39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth .
ERV	Numbers	22	40	Balak killed some cattle and some sheep as his sacrifice . He gave some of the meat to Balaam and some to the leaders who were with him .
ERV	Numbers	22	41	The next morning Balak took Balaam to the town of Bamoth Baal . From there they could see part of the Israelite camp . Footnotes - Numbers 22:5 This … lived Or “ This was the land of the Ammonites. ” - Numbers 22:7 for his service Or “ for the things he needed to make curses. ” In ancient times , when people asked bad things to happen to other people , they often wrote the curses on special bowls and used them in ceremonies . They did this to try to force these bad things to happen . See Deut . 18:10 . - Numbers 22:17 I will pay you very much Or “ I will honor you very much. ” - Numbers 22:22 stop Or “ oppose ” or “ accuse. ” Also in verse
ERV	Numbers	23	23	There is no power that can defeat the people of Jacob . There is no magic that can stop the Israelites . People will say this about Jacob and the Israelites : ‘ Look at the great things God did ! ’ [ b ]
ERV	Numbers	23	2	Balak did what Balaam asked . Then Balak and Balaam killed a ram and a bull on each of the altars .
ERV	Numbers	23	3	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Stay here near this altar . I will go to another place . Then the Lord will come to me , and he will tell me what I must say. ” Then Balaam went away to a higher place .
ERV	Numbers	23	4	God came to Balaam at that place , and Balaam said , “ I have prepared seven altars . And I have killed a bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	5	Then the Lord gave Balaam a message for Balak and said , “ Go back to Balak and say the things that I have given you to say. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	6	So Balaam went back to Balak . Balak was still standing near the altar , and all the leaders of Moab were standing there with them .
ERV	Numbers	23	7	Then Balaam spoke , and this was his message : “ Balak , the king of Moab , brought me here from the eastern mountains of Aram . Balak said to me , ‘ Come , curse Jacob for me . Come , speak against the Israelites. ’
ERV	Numbers	23	8	But God is not against them , so I can not speak against them either ! The Lord has not asked for bad things to happen to these people . So I can not do that either .
ERV	Numbers	23	9	I see these people from the mountain . I see them from the high hills . They live alone . They are not part of another nation .
ERV	Numbers	23	10	Who can count Jacob ’ s people ? They are as many as the grains of dust . No one can count even a fourth of the Israelites . Let me die like a good man . Let my life end as happy as theirs ! ”
ERV	Numbers	23	11	Balak said to Balaam , “ What have you done to me ? I brought you here to curse my enemies , but you have blessed them ! ”
ERV	Numbers	23	12	But Balaam answered , “ I must say the things that the Lord tells me to say. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	13	Then Balak said to him , “ So come with me to another place . At that place you can see more of these people . You can not see all of them—you can only see part of them . Maybe from that place you can curse them for me. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	14	So Balak led Balaam to Watchmen Hills . [ a ] This was on top of Mount Pisgah . There Balak built seven altars and killed a bull and a ram on each altar as a sacrifice .
ERV	Numbers	23	15	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Stay here by this altar while I go meet with God over there. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	16	So the Lord came to Balaam and told Balaam what to say . Then he told Balaam to go back to Balak and say these things .
ERV	Numbers	23	17	So Balaam went to Balak . Balak was still standing near the altar . The leaders of Moab were there with him . Balak saw Balaam coming and said , “ What did the Lord say ? ” Balaam ’ s Second Message
ERV	Numbers	23	18	Then Balaam said this : “ Stand up , Balak , and listen to me . Hear me , Balak son of Zippor .
ERV	Numbers	23	19	God is not a man ; he will not lie . God is not a human being ; his decisions will not change . If he says he will do something , then he will do it . If he makes a promise , then he will do what he promised .
ERV	Numbers	23	20	He told me to bless them . He blessed them , so I can not change that .
ERV	Numbers	23	21	God saw no wrong in Jacob ’ s people . He saw no sin in the Israelites . The Lord is their God , and he is with them . The Great King is with them !
ERV	Numbers	23	22	God brought them out of Egypt . They are as strong as a wild ox .
ERV	Numbers	23	24	The people are as strong as lions , and they fight like lions . And a lion will not rest until it eats what it has caught , until it drinks the blood of what it has killed. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ You didn ’ t ask for good things to happen to these people , but you didn ’ t ask for bad things to happen to them either ! ”
ERV	Numbers	23	26	Balaam answered , “ I told you before that I can only say what the Lord tells me to say. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	27	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ So come with me to another place . Maybe God will be pleased and will allow you to curse them from that place. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	28	So Balak led Balaam to the top of Mount Peor , which looks out over the desert .
ERV	Numbers	23	29	Balaam said , “ Build seven altars here . Then prepare seven bulls and seven rams for the altars. ”
ERV	Numbers	23	30	Balak did what Balaam asked . Balak offered the bulls and rams on the altars . Footnotes - Numbers 23:14 Watchmen Hills Or “ the fields of Zophim. ” - Numbers 23:23 Or “ There is no fortunetelling in Jacob , no magic in Israel . God tells them immediately what he plans to do . ”

ERV	Numbers	24	2	He looked out across the desert and saw all the Israelites . They were camped with the tribes in their different areas . Then the Spirit of God came on him ,
ERV	Numbers	24	3	and he gave this message : “ This message is from Balaam son of Beor . I am speaking about things I see clearly .
ERV	Numbers	24	4	These are the words I heard from God . I saw what God All-Powerful [ a ] showed me . I humbly tell what I clearly see .
ERV	Numbers	24	5	“ People of Jacob , your tents are beautiful ! Israelites , your homes are beautiful !
ERV	Numbers	24	6	You are like rows of palm trees planted by the streams . You are like gardens growing by the rivers . You are like sweet-smelling bushes planted by the Lord . You are like cedar trees growing by the water .

ERV	Numbers	24	9	Israel is like a lion , curled up and lying down . Yes , they are like a young lion , and no one wants to wake him ! Anyone who blesses you will be blessed . And anyone who curses you will have great troubles. ”
ERV	Numbers	24	10	When Balak heard this , he angrily struck his fist against his hand and said to Balaam , “ I called you to come and curse my enemies . But you have blessed them . You have blessed them three times .
ERV	Numbers	24	11	Now leave and go home ! I told you that I would give you a very good payment , but the Lord has caused you to lose your reward. ”
ERV	Numbers	24	12	Balaam said to Balak , “ You sent men to ask me to come . Don ’ t you remember what I told them ? I said ,
ERV	Numbers	24	13	‘ Even if Balak gives me his most beautiful house filled with silver and gold , I can still say only what the Lord commands me to say . I can not do anything myself , good or bad . I must say what the Lord commands. ’
ERV	Numbers	24	14	Now I am going back to my own people . But I will give you this warning . I will tell you what these Israelites will do to you and your people in the future. ” Balaam ’ s Last Message

ERV	Numbers	24	21	Then Balaam saw the Kenites and said this : “ You believe that your country is safe , like a bird ’ s nest [ d ] high on a mountain .
ERV	Numbers	24	22	But you Kenites will be destroyed , just as the Lord destroyed Cain . Assyria will make you prisoners. ”
ERV	Numbers	24	23	Then Balaam said this : “ No one can live when God does this .

ERV	Numbers	25	25	While the Israelites were camped near Acacia , the men committed sexual sins [ a ] with Moabite women . 2-3 The Moabite women invited the men to come and join in their sacrifices to their false gods . So the Israelites joined in worshiping these false gods—they ate the sacrifices and worshiped these gods . There the Israelites began worshiping the false god , Baal of Peor . And the Lord became very angry with them .
ERV	Numbers	25	4	The Lord said to Moses , “ Get all the leaders of these people . Then kill them so that all the people can see . [ b ] Lay their bodies before the Lord . Then the Lord will not show his anger against all the Israelites. ”
ERV	Numbers	25	5	So Moses said to Israel ’ s judges , “ Each of you must find the men in your tribe who have led people to worship the false god , Baal of Peor . Then you must kill these men. ”
ERV	Numbers	25	6	At the time Moses and all the elders of Israel were gathered together at the entrance to the Meeting Tent . An Israelite man brought a Midianite woman home to his brothers . [ c ] He did this where Moses and all the leaders could see . Moses and the leaders were very sad .
ERV	Numbers	25	7	Phinehas was the son of Eleazar and the grandson of Aaron the priest . Phinehas saw this man bring the woman into camp . So he left the meeting and got his spear .
ERV	Numbers	25	8	He followed the Israelite into the tent . Then he used the spear to kill the Israelite man and the Midianite woman in her tent . [ d ] He pushed the spear through both of their bodies . At that time there was a great sickness among the Israelites . But when Phinehas killed these two people , the sickness stopped .
ERV	Numbers	25	9	A total of 24,000 people died from that sickness .
ERV	Numbers	25	10	The Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	25	11	“ I was so angry with the Israelites that I wanted to kill them . But Phinehas , son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest , has saved them from my anger . He did this by showing that he feels strongly , just as I do , that my people must worship only me .
ERV	Numbers	25	12	Tell Phinehas that I am making a peace agreement with him .
ERV	Numbers	25	13	This is the agreement : He and all of his family who live after him will always be priests , because he had strong feelings for his God . And he did what was needed to make the Israelites pure. ”
ERV	Numbers	25	14	The Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son of Salu . He was the leader of a family in the tribe of Simeon .
ERV	Numbers	25	15	And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi . [ e ] She was the daughter of Zur . Zur was the head of a family and leader of a Midianite tribe .
ERV	Numbers	25	16	The Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	25	17	“ The Midianites are your enemies . You must kill them .
ERV	Numbers	25	18	They have already made you their enemies . They tricked you at Peor . And they tricked you with the woman named Cozbi . She was the daughter of a Midianite leader , but she was killed when the sickness came to the Israelites . That sickness was caused because the people were tricked into worshiping the false god Baal of Peor. ” Footnotes - Numbers 25:1 sexual sins Sexual sin was often connected with temples for false gods .

ERV	Numbers	26	54	A large tribe will get much land , and a small tribe will get less land . The land that they get will be equal to the number of people who were counted .
ERV	Numbers	26	55	But you must use lots to decide which tribe gets which part of the land . Each tribe will get its share of the land , and that land will be given the name of that tribe .

ERV	Numbers	27	3	“ Our father died while we were traveling through the desert . He died a natural death . He was not one of the men who joined Korah ’ s group . ( Korah was the man who turned against the Lord . ) But our father had no sons .
ERV	Numbers	27	4	This means that our father ’ s name will not continue . It is not fair that our father ’ s name will not continue . His name will end because he had no sons . So we ask you to give us some of the land that our father ’ s brothers will get. ”
ERV	Numbers	27	5	So Moses asked the Lord what he should do .
ERV	Numbers	27	6	The Lord said to him ,
ERV	Numbers	27	7	“ The daughters of Zelophehad are right . They should share the land with their father ’ s brothers . So give them the land that you would have given to their father .

ERV	Numbers	27	16	“ Lord , you are the God who knows what people are thinking . I pray that you will choose a leader for these people . [ b ]
ERV	Numbers	27	17	I pray that you will choose a leader who will lead them out of this land and bring them into the new land . Then your people will not be like sheep without a shepherd. ”
ERV	Numbers	27	18	So the Lord said to Moses , “ Joshua son of Nun is very wise . [ c ] You will place your hand on him and make him the new leader .
ERV	Numbers	27	19	Tell him to stand before Eleazar the priest and all the people . Then make him the new leader .
ERV	Numbers	27	20	“ Show the people that you are making him leader , [ d ] then all the people will obey him .
ERV	Numbers	27	21	If Joshua needs to make a decision , he will go to Eleazar the priest . Eleazar will use the Urim to learn the Lord ’ s answer . Then Joshua and all the Israelites will do the things God says . If he says , ‘ go to war , ’ they will go to war . And if he says , ‘ go home , ’ they will go home. ”
ERV	Numbers	27	22	Moses obeyed the Lord . Moses told Joshua to stand before Eleazar the priest and all the Israelites .

ERV	Numbers	31	20	You must wash all of your clothes . You must wash anything made with leather , wool , or wood . You must purify yourselves. ”

He said , “ These are the rules that the Lord gave to Moses for soldiers coming back from war . 22-23 You must put gold , silver , bronze , iron , tin , or lead into the fire and then wash these things with the special water to make them pure . If something can be put in the fire , you must put it in fire to purify it . If things can not be put in fire , you must still wash them with the special water .
ERV	Numbers	31	24	On the seventh day you must wash all of your clothes . Then you will be pure . After that you can come into camp. ”
ERV	Numbers	31	25	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	31	26	“ You , Eleazar the priest , and all the leaders should count all the prisoners , animals , and everything the soldiers took in war .
ERV	Numbers	31	27	Then divide these things between the soldiers who went to war and the rest of the Israelites .

ERV	Numbers	32	6	Moses told the people from the tribes of Reuben and Gad , “ Will you let your brothers go and fight while you settle here ?
ERV	Numbers	32	7	Why are you trying to discourage the Israelites ? You will make them not want to cross the river and take the land that the Lord has given to them !

ERV	Numbers	32	22	After the Lord helps us all take the land , you can go back home . Then the Lord and Israel will not think that you are guilty . And the Lord will let you have this land .
ERV	Numbers	32	23	But if you don ’ t do these things , you will be sinning against the Lord . And know for sure that you will be punished for your sin .
ERV	Numbers	32	24	Build cities for your children and barns for your animals . But then , you must do what you promised. ”
ERV	Numbers	32	25	Then the people from the tribes of Gad and Reuben said to Moses , “ We are your servants . You are our master , so we will do what you say .
ERV	Numbers	32	26	Our wives , children , and all our animals will stay in the cities of Gilead .
ERV	Numbers	32	27	But we , your servants , will cross the Jordan River . We will march before the Lord into battle , as our master says. ”
ERV	Numbers	32	28	So Moses , Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and all the leaders of the tribes of Israel heard them make that promise .
ERV	Numbers	32	29	Moses said to them , “ The people of Gad and Reuben will cross the Jordan River . They will march before the Lord into battle . They will help you take the land . And you will give the land of Gilead as their part of the country .
ERV	Numbers	32	30	But if they do not cross the river with you ready to fight , they will not get any land on this side . They will get only a share of the land of Canaan with the rest of you. ”
ERV	Numbers	32	31	The people of Gad and Reuben answered , “ We promise to do what the Lord commanded .
ERV	Numbers	32	33	So Moses gave that land to the people of Gad , to the people of Reuben , and to half the tribe of Manasseh . ( Manasseh was Joseph ’ s son . ) That land included the kingdom of Sihon the Amorite and the kingdom of King Og of Bashan and all the cities around that area .

ERV	Numbers	32	38	Nebo , Baal Meon , and Sibmah . They used the names of the cities that they rebuilt . But they changed the names of Nebo and Baal Meon .
ERV	Numbers	32	39	People from Makir ’ s family group went to Gilead . [ b ] ( Makir was Manasseh ’ s son . ) They defeated the city . They defeated the Amorites who lived there .
ERV	Numbers	32	41	Jair , from the family of Manasseh , defeated the small towns there . Then he called them Towns of Jair .
ERV	Numbers	32	42	Nobah defeated Kenath and the small towns near it . Then he called that place by his own name .

ERV	Numbers	33	49	They camped by the Jordan River in the Jordan Valley in Moab . Their camp went from Beth Jeshimoth to Acacia Field .
ERV	Numbers	33	50	There , the Lord spoke to Moses and said ,
ERV	Numbers	33	51	“ Speak to the Israelites and tell them this : You will cross the Jordan River . You will go into the land of Canaan .
ERV	Numbers	33	52	You will take the land from the people you find there . You must destroy all of their carved statues and idols . You must destroy all of their high places .
ERV	Numbers	33	53	You will take the land and you will settle there , because I am giving this land to you . It will belong to your family groups .
ERV	Numbers	33	54	Each of your family groups will get part of the land . You will throw lots to decide which family group gets each part of the country . Large family groups will get large parts of the land . Small family groups will get small parts of the land . The lots will show which family group gets which part of the land . Each tribe will get its part of the land .
ERV	Numbers	33	55	“ You must force these other people to leave the country . If you let them stay in your country , they will bring many troubles to you . They will be like a needle [ d ] in your eye and a thorn in your side . They will bring many troubles to the country where you will be living .

ERV	Numbers	34	34	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
ERV	Numbers	34	2	“ Speak to the Israelites and tell them this : You will soon enter the land of Canaan . I am giving you that land to be your very own . These will be its borders :
ERV	Numbers	34	3	On the south , you will get part of the desert of Zin near Edom . Your southern border will start at the south end of the Dead Sea .
ERV	Numbers	34	4	It will cross south of Scorpion Pass . It will go through the town of Zin to Kadesh Barnea and then to Hazar Addar , and then it will pass through Azmon .
ERV	Numbers	34	5	From Azmon the border will go to the River of Egypt , [ a ] and it will end at the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Numbers	34	6	Your western border will be the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Numbers	34	7	Your northern border will begin at the Mediterranean Sea and go to Mount Hor .
ERV	Numbers	34	8	From Mount Hor it will go to Lebo Hamath , and then to Zedad .
ERV	Numbers	34	9	Then that border will go to Ziphron and it will end at Hazar Enan . So that will be your northern border .
ERV	Numbers	34	10	Your eastern border will begin at Enan and it will go to Shepham .
ERV	Numbers	34	11	From Shepham the border will go east of Ain to Riblah . The border will continue along the hills by Lake Galilee . [ b ]
ERV	Numbers	34	12	Then the border will continue along the Jordan River . It will end at the Dead Sea . These are the borders around your country. ”
ERV	Numbers	34	13	So Moses gave this command to the Israelites , “ That is the land that you will get . You will throw lots to divide the land among the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh , as the Lord commanded .
ERV	Numbers	34	14	The tribes of Reuben and Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh have already taken their land .
ERV	Numbers	34	15	These two and a half tribes took the land near Jericho—they took the land east of the Jordan River. ”
ERV	Numbers	34	16	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
ERV	Numbers	34	17	“ These are the men who will help you divide the land : Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun ,
ERV	Numbers	34	18	and the leaders of all the tribes . There will be one leader from each tribe . These men will divide the land .
ERV	Numbers	34	19	These are the names of the leaders : from the tribe of Judah—Caleb son of Jephunneh ;
ERV	Numbers	34	20	from the tribe of Simeon—Shemuel son of Ammihud ;
ERV	Numbers	34	21	from the tribe of Benjamin—Elidad son of Kislon ;

ERV	Numbers	34	27	from the tribe of Asher—Ahihud son of Shelomi ;
ERV	Numbers	34	28	from the tribe of Naphtali—Pedahel son of Ammihud. ”
ERV	Numbers	34	29	The Lord chose these men to divide the land of Canaan among the Israelites . Footnotes - Numbers 34:5 River of Egypt That is , the stream called “ Wadi El-Arish. ” - Numbers 34:11 Lake Galilee Literally , “ Kinnereth Lake . ”
ERV	Numbers	35	35	The Lord spoke to Moses . This was in the Jordan Valley in Moab , near the Jordan River , across from Jericho . He said ,
ERV	Numbers	35	2	“ Tell the Israelites that they should give some of the cities in their part of the land to the Levites . The Israelites should give these cities and the pastures around them to the Levites .
ERV	Numbers	35	3	The Levites will be able to live in them . And all the cattle and other animals that belong to the Levites will be able to eat from the pastures around these cities .
ERV	Numbers	35	4	How much of your land should you give to the Levites ? From the walls of the cities , go out
ERV	Numbers	35	1500	feet Literally , “
ERV	Numbers	35	5	Measure off an area around the city for the Levites . Start at the northeast corner and measure
ERV	Numbers	35	3000	feet Literally , “
ERV	Numbers	35	6	Six of those cities will be cities of safety . If a person accidentally kills someone , that person can run to those towns for safety . In addition to those six cities , you will also give
ERV	Numbers	35	42	more cities to the Levites .
ERV	Numbers	35	7	So you will give a total of
ERV	Numbers	35	48	cities to the Levites . You will also give them the land around those cities .
ERV	Numbers	35	8	The large tribes of Israel will get large pieces of land . The small tribes of Israel will get small pieces of land . So the large tribes will give more cities and the small tribes will give fewer cities to the Levites. ”
ERV	Numbers	35	9	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
ERV	Numbers	35	10	“ Tell the people this : You will cross the Jordan River and go into the land of Canaan .
ERV	Numbers	35	11	You must choose towns to be cities of safety . If someone accidentally kills another person , that person can run to one of those towns for safety .
ERV	Numbers	35	12	That person will be safe from anyone from the dead man ’ s family who wants to punish the killer until that person is judged in court .
ERV	Numbers	35	13	There will be six cities of safety .
ERV	Numbers	35	14	Three of them will be east of the Jordan River and three of them will be in the land of Canaan , west of the Jordan River .
ERV	Numbers	35	15	These cities will be places of safety for citizens of Israel and for foreigners and travelers . Any of these people will be able to run to one of these cities if they accidentally kill someone .
ERV	Numbers	35	16	“ If you use an iron weapon [ c ] to kill someone , you are a murderer , and you must die .
ERV	Numbers	35	17	If you use a rock large enough to kill someone and you kill another person , you are a murderer , and you must die .
ERV	Numbers	35	18	If you use a piece of wood large enough to kill someone and you kill another person , you are a murderer , and you must die .
ERV	Numbers	35	19	A member of the dead person ’ s family [ d ] can chase you and kill you . 20-21 “ You might hit someone with your hand or push someone or throw something at them and kill them . If you did that from hate , you are a murderer , and you must be killed . A member of the dead person ’ s family can chase you and kill you .
ERV	Numbers	35	22	“ You might accidentally kill someone , maybe by pushing or by accidentally hitting them with a tool or weapon .
ERV	Numbers	35	23	Perhaps you threw a rock that was large enough to kill , but it hit someone you didn ’ t see and killed them . You didn ’ t plan to kill anyone . You didn ’ t hate the person you killed—it was only an accident .

ERV	Numbers	35	25	If the community decides to protect you from the dead person ’ s family , the community must take you back to your city of safety . You must stay there until the official high priest [ e ] dies . 26-27 “ You must never go outside the limits of your city of safety . If you do and if a member of the dead person ’ s family catches you and kills you , that family member will not be guilty of murder .
ERV	Numbers	35	28	Whoever accidentally killed someone must stay in their city of safety until the high priest dies . After the high priest dies , that person can go back to their own land .
ERV	Numbers	35	29	These rules will be the law forever in all the towns of your people .
ERV	Numbers	35	30	“ A killer should be put to death as a murderer only if there are witnesses . No one can be put to death if there is only one witness .
ERV	Numbers	35	31	“ A murderer must be put to death . Don ’ t take money to change the punishment . That murderer must be killed .
ERV	Numbers	35	32	“ If a person killed someone and then ran to one of the cities of safety , don ’ t take money to let that person go home . That person must stay in that city until the high priest dies .
ERV	Numbers	35	33	“ Don ’ t let your land be polluted with innocent blood . If a person murders someone , the only payment for that crime is that the murderer must be killed ! There is no other payment that will free the land from that crime .

ERV	Numbers	36	36	Manasseh was Joseph ’ s son . Makir was Manasseh ’ s son . Gilead was Makir ’ s son . The leaders of Gilead ’ s family went to talk to Moses and the leaders of the tribes of Israel .
ERV	Numbers	36	2	They said , “ Sir , the Lord commanded us to get our land by throwing lots . And sir , the Lord commanded that the land of Zelophehad our brother be given to his daughters .
ERV	Numbers	36	3	Maybe a man from one of the other tribes will marry one of Zelophehad ’ s daughters . Will that land leave our family ? Will the people of that other tribe get the land ? Will we lose the land that we got by throwing lots ?
ERV	Numbers	36	4	People might sell their land , but in the Jubilee year , all the land is returned to the tribe that really owns it . At that time who will get the land that belongs to Zelophehad ’ s daughters ? Will our tribe lose that land forever ? ”
ERV	Numbers	36	5	Moses gave this command from the Lord to the Israelites : “ These men from the tribe of Joseph are right .
ERV	Numbers	36	6	This is the Lord ’ s command to Zelophehad ’ s daughters : If you want to marry someone , you must marry someone from your own tribe .
ERV	Numbers	36	7	In this way land will not be passed from tribe to tribe among the Israelites . Each Israelite will keep the land that belonged to their own ancestors .
ERV	Numbers	36	8	And if a woman gets her father ’ s land , she must marry someone from her own tribe . That way everyone will keep the land that belonged to his ancestors .
ERV	Numbers	36	9	So the land must not be passed from tribe to tribe among the Israelites . Each Israelite will keep the land that belonged to their own ancestors. ”
ERV	Numbers	36	10	So Zelophehad ’ s daughters obeyed the Lord ’ s command to Moses .
ERV	Numbers	36	11	Zelophehad ’ s daughters—Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Noah—married their cousins on their father ’ s side of the family .
ERV	Numbers	36	12	Their husbands were from Manasseh ’ s family groups , so their land remained within their father ’ s family group and tribe .
ERV	Numbers	36	13	So these are the laws and commands that the Lord gave to Moses in the Jordan Valley in Moab by the Jordan River , across from Jericho .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the commands that Moses gave the Israelites while they were in the Jordan Valley , in the desert east of the Jordan River . This was across from Suph , between the desert of Paran and the cities Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	2	The trip from Mount Horeb through the mountains of Seir to Kadesh Barnea takes only eleven days .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	3	But it was
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	40	But you—you must turn around , take the road to the Red Sea and go back into the desert. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	4	This was after he defeated Sihon and Og . ( Sihon was the king of the Amorites and lived in Heshbon . Og was the king of Bashan and lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei . )
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	5	The Israelites were in Moab on the east side of the Jordan River when Moses began to explain what God had commanded :
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	6	“ At Mount Horeb the Lord our God spoke to us . He said , ‘ You have stayed at this mountain long enough .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	7	Go to the hill country where the Amorites live and to all the neighboring areas in the Jordan Valley , the hill country , the western slopes , the Negev , and the seacoast . Go throughout the land of Canaan and Lebanon as far as the great river , the Euphrates .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	8	Look , I am giving you this land . Go and take it . It is the land that I , the Lord , promised to give to your ancestors—Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I promised to give this land to them and to their descendants. ’ Moses Chooses Leaders
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	9	“ At that time I told you , ‘ I can ’ t take care of you by myself .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	10	people . I also gave you officers for each of your tribes .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	11	May the Lord , the God of your ancestors , give you
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	1000	people , over
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	12	But I can not take care of you and solve all your arguments by myself .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	13	So choose some men from each tribe , and I will make them leaders over you . Choose wise men with experience who understand people. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	14	“ And you said , ‘ That is a good thing to do. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	15	“ So I took the wise , experienced men you chose from your tribes , and I made them your leaders . In this way I gave you leaders over
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	100	people , over
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	50	people , and over
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	16	“ At that time I told these judges , ‘ Listen to the arguments between your people . Be fair when you judge each case . It doesn ’ t matter if the problem is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner . You must judge each case fairly .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	17	You must treat everyone the same when you judge . You must listen carefully to everyone—whether they are important or not . Don ’ t be afraid of anyone , because your decision is from God . But if there is a case too hard for you to judge , bring it to me and I will judge it. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	18	At that same time I also told you everything you must do . The Spies Go to Canaan
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	19	“ So we obeyed the Lord our God . We left Mount Horeb and went to the hill country of the Amorites . You remember that big , terrible desert that we walked through . We came as far as Kadesh Barnea .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	20	Then I said to you , ‘ You have now come to the hill country of the Amorites . The Lord our God will give us this country .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	21	Look , there it is ! Go up and take the land for your own . The Lord , the God of your ancestors , told you to do this , so don ’ t be afraid or worry about anything. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	22	“ But all of you came to me and said , ‘ Let ’ s send some men to look at the land first . They can spy out the land and come back and tell us the way we should go and which cities we will come to. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	23	“ I thought that was a good idea . So I chose twelve men from among you , one man from each tribe .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	24	Then they left and went up to the hill country . They came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	25	They took some of the fruit from that land and brought it back to us . They told us about the land and said , ‘ The Lord our God is giving us a good land. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	26	“ But you refused to go into the land . You refused to obey the Lord your God .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	27	You went to your tents and began to complain . You said , ‘ The Lord hates us ! He brought us out of the land of Egypt just to let the Amorites destroy us .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	28	Where can we go now ? The men we sent have frightened us with their report . They said , “ The people there are bigger and taller than we are . The cities are big and have walls as high as the sky . And we saw giants [ a ] there ! ” ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	29	“ So I said to you , ‘ Don ’ t be upset or afraid of those people .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord your God is in front , leading you . He will fight for you just as he did in Egypt .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	31	You saw what happened in the desert . You saw how the Lord your God carried you like a man carries his child . He brought you safely all the way to this place. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	32	“ But you didn ’ t trust the Lord your God then either .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	33	But he was always in front , going ahead to find a place for you to camp . At night , he was in the fire that showed you where to go . And during the day , he was in the cloud . People Not Allowed to Enter Canaan
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	34	“ The Lord heard what you said , and he was angry . He made a vow . He said ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	35	‘ Not one of you evil people who are alive now will go into the good land that I promised to your ancestors .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	36	Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will see that land . I will give Caleb the land he walked on , and I will give that land to his descendants , because he did all that I , the Lord , commanded. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	37	“ The Lord was also angry with me because of you . He said to me , ‘ Moses , you can not enter the land , either .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	38	But your helper , Joshua son of Nun , will go into the land . Encourage Joshua , because he will lead the Israelites to take the land for their own .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	39	You thought your little children would be taken by your enemies . But those children , who are still too young to know right from wrong , will go into the land . I will give it to them . Your children will take the land for their own .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	41	“ Then you said , ‘ Moses , we sinned against the Lord , but now we will do what the Lord our God commanded us before—we will go and fight. ’ “ Then each of you put on your weapons . You thought it would be easy to go and take the hill country .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	42	But the Lord said to me , ‘ Tell the people not to go up there and fight , because I will not be with them . Their enemies will defeat them ! ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	43	“ I spoke to you , but you did not listen . You refused to obey the Lord ’ s command . You thought you could use your own power , so you went up into the hill country .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	44	The Amorites who lived there came out like a swarm of bees and chased you all the way from Seir to Hormah .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	45	Then you came back crying to the Lord for help , but the Lord refused to listen to you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	1	46	So you stayed at Kadesh for such a long time . Footnotes - Deuteronomy 1:28 giants Literally , “ Anakites , ” descendants of Anak , a family famous for tall and powerful fighting men . See Num . 13:33 .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	2	Then the Lord said to me ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	3	‘ You have traveled around these mountains long enough . Turn north .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	4	Tell the people this : You will pass through the land of Seir . This land belongs to your relatives , the descendants of Esau . They will be afraid of you . Be very careful .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	5	Don ’ t fight them . I will not give you any of their land—not even a foot of it , because I gave the hill country of Seir to Esau to keep as his own .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	6	You must pay the people of Esau for any food you eat or water you drink there .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	7	Remember that the Lord your God has blessed you in everything you have done . He knows about everything that happened on the trip through this great desert . The Lord your God has been with you these
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	40	years . You have always had everything you needed. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	8	“ So we passed by our relatives , the people of Esau living there in Seir . We left the road that leads from the Jordan Valley to the towns of Elath and Ezion Geber . We turned onto the road that goes to the desert in Moab . Israel at Ar
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	9	“ The Lord said to me , ‘ Don ’ t bother the Moabites . Don ’ t start a war against them . I will not give you any of their land . They are the descendants of Lot , [ b ] and I gave them the city of Ar. ’ ”
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	10	( In the past , the Emites lived in Ar . They were strong people , and there were many of them . They were very tall , like the Anakites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	11	The Anakites were part of the Rephaites . People thought the Emites were also Rephaites , but the people of Moab called them Emites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horites also lived in Seir in the past . Then Esau ’ s people destroyed the Horites , took their land , and settled there , just as the Israelites did to the people in the land that the Lord gave them . )
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	13	“ The Lord told me , ‘ Now , go to the other side of Zered Valley. ’ So we crossed Zered Valley .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	14	It was
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	38	years from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until the time we crossed Zered Valley . As the Lord had promised , all the fighting men in our camp from that generation had died .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	15	The Lord had opposed those men until they were all dead and gone from our camp .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	16	“ After all the fighting men were dead and gone ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	17	the Lord said to me ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	18	‘ Today you must cross the border at Ar and go into Moab .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	19	You will be just across from the Ammonites . Don ’ t bother them or fight with them , because I will not give you their land . They are descendants of Lot , and I have given that land to them. ’ ”
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	20	( That country is also known as the Land of Rephaim . The Rephaites lived there in the past . The people of Ammon called them the Zamzummites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	21	There were many Rephaites , and they were very strong and tall like the Anakites . But the Lord helped the Ammonites destroy them . The Ammonites took that land and live there now .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	22	God did the same thing for Esau ’ s people . In the past the Horites lived in Seir . [ c ] But Esau ’ s people destroyed the Horites , and Esau ’ s descendants still live there today .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	23	God did the same thing for some people from Crete . The Avvites lived in the towns around Gaza , but the Cretans destroyed them , took the land , and live there now . ) Fighting the Amorites
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	24	“ The Lord told me , ‘ Get ready to go across Arnon Valley . I will let you defeat Sihon the Amorite , the king of Heshbon . I will let you take his country . So fight against him and take his land .

ERV	Deuteronomy	2	29	Let us go through your land until we go across the Jordan River into the land that the Lord our God is giving us . Other people have let us go through their land—the people of Esau living in Seir and the Moabites living in Ar. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	30	“ But King Sihon of Heshbon would not let us pass through his country . The Lord your God had made him very stubborn and ready to fight . The Lord did this so that he could help you defeat King Sihon . And today we know that is what happened .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	31	“ The Lord said to me , ‘ I am giving King Sihon and his country to you . Now , go take his land ! ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	32	“ Then King Sihon and all his people came out to fight against us at Jahaz .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	33	But the Lord our God gave him to us . We defeated King Sihon , his sons , and all his people .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	34	We captured all the cities that belonged to King Sihon at that time . We completely destroyed the people in every city—the men , women , and children . We did not leave anyone alive !
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	35	We took only the cattle and the valuable things from those cities .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	36	We defeated the town of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley and the other town in the middle of that valley . The Lord let us defeat all the cities between the Arnon Valley and Gilead . No city was too strong for us .
ERV	Deuteronomy	2	37	But you did not go near the land that belongs to the people of Ammon . You did not go near the shores of the Jabbok River or the cities of the hill country .

ERV	Deuteronomy	3	16	And to the tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad , I gave the land that begins at Gilead and goes from the Arnon Valley to the Jabbok River . The middle of the valley is one border . The Jabbok River is the border for the Ammonites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	3	17	The Jordan River near the desert is their western border . Lake Galilee [ b ] is north of this area and the Dead Sea [ c ] is to the south . It is at the bottom of the cliffs of Pisgah , which are to the east .

ERV	Deuteronomy	3	19	Your wives , your little children , and your cattle ( I know you have many cattle ) will stay here in the cities I have given you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	3	20	But you must help your Israelite relatives until they take the land that the Lord is giving them on the other side of the Jordan River . Help them until the Lord gives them peace there , just as he did for you here . Then you may come back to this land that I have given you. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	3	21	“ Then I told Joshua , ‘ You have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings . The Lord will do the same thing to all the kingdoms you will enter .

ERV	Deuteronomy	3	25	Please let me go across the Jordan River and see the good land on the other side . Let me see the beautiful hill country and Lebanon. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	3	26	“ But the Lord was angry with me because of you and refused to listen to me . The Lord said to me , ‘ That ’ s enough ! Don ’ t say another word about this .
ERV	Deuteronomy	3	27	Go up to the top of Mount Pisgah . Look to the west , to the north , to the south , and to the east . You may see these things with your eyes , but you can never go across the Jordan River .
ERV	Deuteronomy	3	28	You must give instructions to Joshua . Encourage him . Make him strong , because Joshua must lead the people across the Jordan River . You can see the land , but Joshua will lead them into that land . He will help them take the land and live in it. ’

ERV	Deuteronomy	4	4	But all of you who stayed with the Lord your God are alive today .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	2	You must not add to what I command you . And you must not take anything away . You must obey the commands of the Lord your God that I have given you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	3	“ You have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor . The Lord your God destroyed all your people who followed the false god Baal at that place .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	5	“ I taught you the laws and rules that the Lord my God commanded me . I did this so you could obey them in the land you are ready to enter and take for your own .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	6	Obey these laws carefully . This will show the people of the other nations that you are wise and sensible . They will hear about these laws and say , ‘ Truly , the people of this great nation are wise and sensible. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	7	“ The Lord our God is near when we ask him to help us . No other nation has a god like that !
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	8	And no other nation is great enough to have laws and rules as good as the teachings I give you today .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	9	But you must be careful ! Be sure that as long as you live you never forget what you have seen . You must teach these things to your children and grandchildren .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	10	Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Mount Horeb . The Lord said to me , ‘ Gather the people together to listen to what I have to say . Then they will learn to respect me as long as they live on earth . And they will teach these things to their children. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	11	You came near and stood at the bottom of the mountain . The mountain burned with fire that reached up to the sky . There were thick black clouds and darkness .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	12	Then the Lord spoke to you from the fire . You heard the sound of someone speaking , but you did not see any form . There was only a voice .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	13	The Lord told you about his agreement , which he commanded you to obey . He told you about the Ten Commandments , which he wrote on two stone tablets .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	14	At that time the Lord also commanded me to teach you the other laws and rules that you must follow in the land you are going to take and live in .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	15	“ On the day the Lord spoke to you from the fire at Mount Horeb , you did not see him—there was no shape for God .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	16	So be careful ! Don ’ t sin and destroy yourselves by making false gods or statues in the shape of any living thing . Don ’ t make an idol that looks like a man or a woman ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	17	or like an animal on the earth , or like a bird that flies in the sky .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	18	And don ’ t make an idol that looks like anything that crawls on the ground or like a fish in the sea .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	19	And be careful when you look up to the sky and see the sun , the moon , and the stars—all the many things in the sky . Be careful that you are not tempted to worship and serve them . The Lord your God lets the other people in the world do this .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	20	But the Lord brought you out of Egypt to make you his own special people . He saved you from Egypt . It was as if he pulled you from a hot furnace . [ a ] And now you are his people .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	21	“ The Lord was angry with me because of you . He swore that I could not go across the Jordan River into the good land that the Lord your God is giving you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	22	So I must die here in this land . I can not go across the Jordan River , but you will soon go across it and take that good land and live there .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	23	You must be careful not to forget the agreement that the Lord your God made with you . You must obey the Lord ’ s command . Don ’ t make any idols in any form ,

ERV	Deuteronomy	4	26	So I am warning you now . Heaven and earth are my witnesses ! If you do such an evil thing , you will quickly be destroyed ! You are crossing the Jordan River now to take that land . But if you make any idols , you will not live there very long . No , you will be destroyed completely !
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	27	The Lord will scatter you among the nations . And only a few of you will be left alive to go to the countries where the Lord will send you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will serve gods made by men—things made of wood and stone that can not see or hear or eat or smell !
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	29	But there in these other lands you will look for the Lord your God . And if you look for him with all your heart and soul , you will find him .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	30	When you are in trouble—when all these things happen to you—then you will come back to the Lord your God and obey him .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	31	The Lord your God is a merciful God ! He will not leave you there or destroy you completely . He will not forget the agreement that he made with your ancestors . Think About the Great Things God Did
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	32	“ Has anything this great ever happened before ? Never ! Look at the past . Think about everything that happened before you were born . Go all the way back to the time when God made people on the earth . Look at everything that has happened anywhere in the world . Has anyone ever heard about anything as great as this ? No !
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	33	You people heard God speaking to you from a fire , and you are still alive . Has that ever happened to anyone else ? No !
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	34	Has any other god ever tried to go and take a people for himself from inside another nation ? No ! But you yourselves have seen everything that the Lord your God did for you . He showed you his power and strength . You saw the troubles that tested the people . You saw miracles and wonders . You saw war and the terrible things that happened .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	35	The Lord showed you all this so that you would know that he is God . There is no other god like him .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	36	He let you hear his voice from heaven so that he could teach you a lesson . On earth he let you see his great fire , and he spoke to you from it .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	37	“ He loved your ancestors . That is why he chose you , their descendants . And that is why he brought you out of Egypt . He was with you and brought you out with his great power .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	38	When you moved forward , he forced out nations that were greater and more powerful than you . And he led you into their land . He gave you their land to live in , as he is still doing today .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	39	“ So today you must remember and accept that the Lord is God . He is God in heaven above and on the earth below . There is no other god !
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	40	And you must obey his laws and commands that I give you today . Then everything will go well with you and your children who live after you . And you will live a long time in the land the Lord your God is giving you—it will be yours forever. ” Moses Chooses the Cities of Safety

ERV	Deuteronomy	4	44	Moses gave God ’ s law to the Israelites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	4	45	Moses gave these teachings , laws , and rules to the people after they came out of Egypt .

ERV	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made an agreement with us at Mount Horeb .
ERV	Deuteronomy	5	3	The Lord did not make this agreement with our ancestors , but with us—yes , with all of us who are alive here today .
ERV	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord spoke with you face to face at that mountain . He spoke to you from the fire .

ERV	Deuteronomy	29	15	Yes , he is making this agreement with all of you who stand here with us today before the Lord our God . But this agreement is also for our descendants who are not here with us today .
ERV	Deuteronomy	29	16	You remember how we lived in the land of Egypt . And you remember how we traveled through the countries that were on our way here .

ERV	Deuteronomy	29	24	“ All the other nations will ask , ‘ Why did the Lord do this to this land ? Why was he so angry ? ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	29	25	The answer will be , ‘ This happened because the Israelites left the agreement of the Lord , the God of their ancestors . They stopped following the agreement he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt .
ERV	Deuteronomy	29	26	The Israelites started serving other gods—gods they never worshiped before . The Lord told his people not to worship those gods .
ERV	Deuteronomy	29	27	That is why the Lord became very angry with the people of this land . So he brought to them all the curses that are written in this book .
ERV	Deuteronomy	29	28	The Lord became very angry and upset with them . So he took them out of their land . He put them in another land , where they are today. ’

You must obey the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Then these good things will happen to you . Life or Death
ERV	Deuteronomy	30	11	“ This command that I give you today is not too hard for you . It is not a secret hidden in some far away land .

ERV	Deuteronomy	30	14	No , the word is very near to you . It is in your mouth and in your heart . So you can obey it .

ERV	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if you turn away from your God and refuse to listen , if you are led away to worship and serve other gods ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	30	18	you will be destroyed . I am warning you today , if you turn away from God , you will not live long in that land across the Jordan River that you are ready to enter and take for your own .
ERV	Deuteronomy	30	19	“ Today I am giving you a choice of two ways . And I ask heaven and earth to be witnesses of your choice . You can choose life or death . The first choice will bring a blessing . The other choice will bring a curse . So choose life ! Then you and your children will live .

ERV	Deuteronomy	31	31	Then Moses went and spoke these words to all the Israelites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	2	Moses said to them , “ I am now
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	120	years old . I can not lead you anymore . The Lord said to me , ‘ You will not go across the Jordan River. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	3	But the Lord your God will lead you people into that land . He will destroy these nations for you . You will take their land away from them . The Lord said that Joshua must lead you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	4	“ The Lord destroyed Sihon and Og . He destroyed those Amorite kings and he will do the same thing for you again !
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	5	The Lord will help you defeat these nations . But you must do to them everything I told you to do .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and be brave . Don ’ t be afraid of those people because the Lord your God is with you . He will not fail you or leave you. ”
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses called Joshua . All the Israelites watched while Moses said to Joshua , “ Be strong and brave . You will lead these people into the land that the Lord promised to give to their ancestors . You will help the Israelites take that land and divide it among them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	8	The Lord will lead you . He himself is with you . He will not fail you or leave you . Don ’ t worry . Don ’ t be afraid ! ” Moses Writes the Book of Teachings
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	9	Then Moses wrote this Book of Teachings and gave it to the priests , who are from the tribe of Levi . They have the work of carrying the Lord ’ s Box of the Agreement . Moses also gave it to all the elders of Israel .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	10	Then Moses spoke to the leaders . He said , “ At the end of every seven years , in the Year of Freedom , [ a ] read these teachings at the Festival of Shelters .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	11	At that time all the Israelites must come to meet with the Lord your God at the special place he will choose . Then you must read the teachings to the people so that they can hear them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	12	Bring together all the people—the men , the women , the little children , and the foreigners living in your cities . They will hear the teachings , and they will learn to respect the Lord your God . Then they will be able to do everything in this Book of Teachings .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	13	If their descendants don ’ t know the teachings , they will hear them , and they will learn to respect the Lord your God . They will respect him as long as you live in your country . You will soon go across the Jordan River and take that land to be your own. ” The Lord Calls Moses and Joshua
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	14	The Lord said to Moses , “ Now the time is near for you to die . Get Joshua and come to the Meeting Tent . I will tell Joshua what he must do. ” So Moses and Joshua went to the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	15	The Lord appeared at the Tent in a tall cloud . The tall cloud stood over the entrance of the Tent .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	16	The Lord said to Moses , “ You will die soon . And after you have gone to be with your ancestors , these people will not continue to be faithful to me . They will break the agreement I made with them . They will leave me and begin worshiping other gods—the false gods of the land where they are going .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	17	At that time I will become very angry with them , and I will leave them . I will refuse to help them , and they will be destroyed . Terrible things will happen to them , and they will have many troubles . Then they will say , ‘ These bad things happened to us because our God is not with us. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	18	And I will refuse to help them , because they have done evil and worshiped other gods .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ So write down this song , and teach it to the Israelites . Teach them to sing this song . Then this song will be a witness for me against the Israelites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	20	I will take them into the land that I promised to give to their ancestors—a land filled with many good things . [ b ] And they will have all they want to eat . They will have a rich life . But then they will turn to other gods and serve them . They will turn away from me and break my agreement .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	21	Then many terrible things will happen to them . They will have many troubles . At that time their descendants will still know this song , and it will show them how wrong they are . I have not yet taken them into the land I promised to give them . But I already know what they are planning to do there. ”
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	22	So that same day Moses wrote down the song and taught it to the Israelites .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	23	Then the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun and said , “ Be strong and brave . You will lead the Israelites into the land I promised them , and I will be with you. ” Moses Warns the Israelites
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	24	Moses carefully wrote all these teachings in a book . When he finished ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	25	he gave a command to the Levites . ( These men carry the Lord ’ s Box of the Agreement . ) Moses said ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this Book of Teachings and put it by the side of the Box of the Agreement of the Lord your God . Then it will be a witness against you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	27	I know you are very stubborn . I know you want to live your own way . Look , you refused to obey the Lord while I was with you . So I know you will refuse to obey him after I die .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	28	Bring together all the officers and leaders of your tribes . I will tell them these things . And I will call heaven and earth to be witnesses against them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	29	I know that after my death you will become evil . You will turn from the way I commanded you to follow . Terrible things will happen to you in the future , because you want to do what the Lord says is wrong . You will make him angry because of the evil things you do. ” The Song of Moses
ERV	Deuteronomy	31	30	All the Israelites were gathered together , and Moses sang this whole song for them : Footnotes - Deuteronomy 31:10 Year of Freedom That is , the year for canceling debts . - Deuteronomy 31:20 land … things Literally , “ land flowing with milk and honey . ”

ERV	Deuteronomy	32	3	Praise God [ a ] as I speak the Lord ’ s name !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	4	“ The Lord is the Rock , and his work is perfect ! Yes , all his ways are right ! God is true and faithful . He is good and honest .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	5	And you are not really his children . You are completely unfaithful to him . You are crooked liars .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	6	Is this the way you repay the Lord for all he has done for you ? You are stupid , foolish people . He is your Father and your Creator . He made you , and he supports you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	7	“ Remember the days of the past . Think about what happened so long ago . Ask your father ; he will tell you . Ask your leaders ; they will tell you .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	8	God Most High separated the people on earth and gave each nation its land . He set up borders for all people . He made as many nations as there are angels . [ b ]
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	9	The Lord chose his people to be his own . The people of Jacob belong to him .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	10	“ The Lord found them in the desert , in an empty , windy land . He surrounded them and watched over them . He protected them like the pupil of his eye ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	11	like an eagle when she makes her young leave the nest to fly . She stays close to them , ready to help . She spreads her wings to catch them when they fall and carries them to a safe place .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	12	The Lord alone led his people . They had no help from any foreign god .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	13	The Lord helped them take control of the hill country . They took the harvest in the fields . He gave them honey from the cliffs and olive oil from the rocky ground .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	14	He gave his people butter from the herd and milk from the flock . He gave them lambs and goats . They had the best rams from Bashan and the finest wheat . They drank the best wine made from the juice of red grapes .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	15	“ But Jeshurun [ c ] became fat and kicked like a bull . ( Yes , you people were fed well and became full and fat . ) They left the God who made them ! They ran away from the Rock who saved them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	16	They made him jealous by worshiping other gods . They made him angry with those disgusting idols .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	17	They offered sacrifices to demons—gods that are not God . These were new gods they had not known before , gods their ancestors never knew .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	18	You people left the Rock who made you ; you forgot the God who gave you life .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	19	“ The Lord saw this and became upset . His sons and daughters made him angry !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	20	So he said , ‘ I will turn away from them , then let ’ s see what happens ! They are a rebellious people . They are like children who will not learn their lessons .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	21	They made me jealous with things that are not really gods . They made me angry with their worthless idols . So I will use people who are not really a nation to make them jealous . I will use a worthless [ d ] nation to make them angry .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	22	My anger will burn like a fire , burning down to the deepest grave , burning the earth and all it produces , burning deep down below the mountains .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	23	“ ‘ I will bring troubles to the Israelites . I will shoot all my arrows at them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	24	They will become thin from hunger . Terrible diseases will destroy them . I will send wild animals against them . Poisonous snakes and lizards will bite them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	25	In the streets , soldiers will kill them . In their houses , terrible things will happen . Soldiers will kill young men and women . They will kill babies and old people .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	26	“ ‘ I thought about destroying the Israelites so that people would forget them completely !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	27	But I know what their enemies would say . The enemy would not understand . They would brag and say , “ The Lord did not destroy Israel . We won by our own power ! ” ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	28	“ They are foolish . They don ’ t understand .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	29	If they were wise , they would understand ; they would know what would happen to them .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	30	Can one person chase away
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	1000	men ? Can two men cause 10,000 men to run away ? It will happen only if the Lord gives them to their enemy . This will happen only if their Rock sells them like slaves .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	31	The ‘ rock ’ of our enemies is not strong like our Rock . Even our enemies know that .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is like the poison of deadly snakes .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	34	“ The Lord says , ‘ I am saving that punishment . I have it locked up in my storehouse !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	35	I will punish them for the bad things they did . But I am saving that punishment for when they slip and do bad things . Their time of trouble is near . Their punishment will come quickly. ’
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	36	“ The Lord will judge his people . They are his servants , and he will show them mercy . He will see that their power is gone . He will see that they are all helpless— the slaves and free people too .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	37	Then the Lord will say , ‘ Where are the false gods ? Where is the “ rock ” that you ran to for protection ?
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	38	Those false gods ate the fat of your sacrifices . And they drank the wine of your offerings . So let them get up and help you ! Let them protect you !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	39	“ ‘ Now , see that I , and only I , am God ! There is no other God ! I put people to death , and I let people live . I can hurt people , and I can make them well . No one can save another person from my power !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	40	I raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise . As surely as I live forever , these things will happen !
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	41	I swear , I will sharpen my flashing sword . I will use it to punish my enemies . I will give them the punishment they deserve .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	42	My enemies will be killed and taken as prisoners . My arrows will be covered with their blood . My sword will cut off the heads of their soldiers. ’

ERV	Deuteronomy	32	46	he said to them , “ You must be sure to pay attention to all the commands I tell you today . And you must tell your children to obey completely the commands in this Law .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	47	Don ’ t think these teachings are not important . They are your life ! Through these teachings you will live a long time in the land across the Jordan River that you are ready to take. ” Moses on Mount Nebo
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	48	The Lord spoke to Moses that same day . He said ,
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Go to the Abarim Mountains . Go up on Mount Nebo in the land of Moab across from the city of Jericho . Then you can look at the land of Canaan that I am giving to the Israelites to live in .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	50	You will die on that mountain . You will go to be with your people , the same as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	51	This is because you both sinned against me . You were at the waters of Meribah near Kadesh , in the desert of Zin . There , in front of the Israelites , you did not honor me and show that I am holy .
ERV	Deuteronomy	32	52	So now you may see the land that I am giving to the Israelites . But you can not go into that land. ” Footnotes - Deuteronomy 32:3 Praise God Or “ Give honor to God ” or “ Speak of the greatness of God. ” - Deuteronomy 32:8 angels This is from the ancient Greek version .

ERV	Deuteronomy	33	16	Let the earth give its best to Joseph . He was separated from his brothers . So may the Lord in the burning bush give his best to Joseph .

ERV	Deuteronomy	34	34	Moses climbed Mount Nebo . Moses went from the Jordan Valley in Moab to the top of Mount Pisgah . This was across the Jordan River from Jericho . The Lord showed Moses all the land from Gilead to Dan .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	2	He showed him all the land of Naphtali , Ephraim , and Manasseh . He showed him all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	3	He showed Moses the Negev and the valley that goes from Zoar to Jericho , the city of palm trees .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	4	The Lord said to Moses , “ This is the land I promised to Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . I said to them , ‘ I will give this land to your descendants . I have let you see the land , but you can not go there. ’ ”
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	5	Then Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , died there in the land of Moab . The Lord had told Moses this would happen .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	6	He buried Moses in Moab . This was in the valley across from Beth Peor . But even today , no one knows exactly where Moses ’ grave is .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	7	Moses was
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	120	years old when he died . He was as strong as ever , and his eyes were still good .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	8	The Israelites cried for Moses for
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	30	days . They stayed in the Jordan Valley in Moab until the time of sadness was finished . Joshua Becomes the New Leader
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	9	Moses had put his hands on Joshua and appointed him to be the new leader . Then Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom . So the Israelites began to obey Joshua , and they did what the Lord had commanded Moses .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	10	Israel never had another prophet like Moses : The Lord knew Moses face to face .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	11	The Lord sent Moses to do powerful miracles in the land of Egypt . Pharaoh , all his officers , and all the people in Egypt saw those miracles .
ERV	Deuteronomy	34	12	No other prophet ever did as many powerful and amazing things as Moses did for the Israelites to see .
ERV	Joshua	1	1	Moses was the Lord ’ s servant , and Joshua son of Nun was Moses ’ helper . After Moses died , the Lord spoke to Joshua and said ,
ERV	Joshua	1	2	“ My servant Moses is dead . Now you and all these people must go across the Jordan River . You must go into the land I am giving to the Israelites .
ERV	Joshua	1	3	I promised Moses that I would give you this land , so I will give you all the land wherever you go .
ERV	Joshua	1	4	All the land from the desert to Lebanon all the way to the great river ( that is , the Euphrates River ) and all the land of the Hittites will be yours . And all the land from here to the Mediterranean Sea in the west ( that is , the place where the sun sets ) will be within your borders .
ERV	Joshua	1	5	Just as I was with Moses , I will be with you . No one will be able to stop you all your life . I will not abandon you . I will never leave you .
ERV	Joshua	1	6	“ Joshua , you must be strong and brave ! You must lead these people so that they can take their land . I promised their fathers that I would give them this land .
ERV	Joshua	1	7	But you must be strong and brave about obeying the commands my servant Moses gave you . If you follow his teachings exactly , you will be successful in everything you do .
ERV	Joshua	1	8	Always remember what is written in that book of law . Speak about that book and study it day and night . Then you can be sure to obey what is written there . If you do this , you will be wise and successful in everything you do .
ERV	Joshua	1	9	Remember , I commanded you to be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid , because the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. ” Joshua Takes Command
ERV	Joshua	1	10	So Joshua gave orders to the leaders of the people :
ERV	Joshua	1	11	“ Go through the camp and tell the people , ‘ Get some food ready . Three days from now we will go across the Jordan River and take the land that the Lord our God is giving us. ’ ”
ERV	Joshua	1	12	Then Joshua said to the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh , 13-14 “ Remember what the Lord ’ s servant Moses told you . He said that the Lord your God would give you a place to live . So he has given you this land east of the Jordan River . But now you must help your relatives get their land . Your wives and children can stay here with your animals . But all your fighting men must prepare for battle and lead the men of the other tribes across the river .
ERV	Joshua	1	15	The Lord has given you a place to live , and he will do the same for your brothers . But you must help them until they take control of the land the Lord your God is giving them . Then you can come back and settle here on the east side of the river . This is the land that the Lord ’ s servant Moses said would be yours. ”
ERV	Joshua	1	16	Then the people answered Joshua , “ We will do whatever you command us to do . We will go wherever you tell us to go .
ERV	Joshua	1	17	We will obey whatever you say , just as we obeyed Moses . We only ask that the Lord your God be with you just as he was with Moses .
ERV	Joshua	1	18	Then anyone who refuses to obey your commands or turns against you will be killed . Just be strong and brave ! ”
ERV	Joshua	2	2	But someone told the king of Jericho , “ Last night some men from Israel came to look for weaknesses in our country. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	3	So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab : “ Do not hide the men who came and stayed in your house . Bring them out . They have come to spy on our country. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	4	Rahab had hidden the two men , but she said , “ They did come here , but I didn ’ t know where they came from .
ERV	Joshua	2	5	In the evening , when it was time to close the city gate , the men left . I don ’ t know where they went . But if you go quickly , maybe you can catch them. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	6	( Rahab said this , but really she had taken the men up to the roof and had hidden them in the flax [ b ] that she had piled up there . )
ERV	Joshua	2	7	So the king ’ s men went out of the city , and the people closed the city gates . The king ’ s men went to look for the two men from Israel . They went to the Jordan River and looked at all the places where people cross the river .
ERV	Joshua	2	8	The two men were ready to sleep for the night , but Rahab went to the roof to talk to them .
ERV	Joshua	2	9	She said , “ I know that the Lord has given this land to your people . You frighten us . Everyone living in this country is afraid of you .
ERV	Joshua	2	10	We are afraid because we have heard about the ways that the Lord helped you . We heard that he dried up the Red Sea when you came out of Egypt . We also heard what you did to the two Amorite kings , Sihon and Og . We heard how you destroyed those kings living east of the Jordan River .
ERV	Joshua	2	11	When we heard about this , we were very afraid . And now , not one of our men is brave enough to fight you , because the Lord your God rules the heavens above and the earth below !
ERV	Joshua	2	12	So now , I want you to make a promise to me . I was kind to you and helped you . So promise me before the Lord that you will be kind to my family . Please tell me that you will do this .
ERV	Joshua	2	13	Tell me that you will allow my family to live—my father , mother , brothers , sisters , and all their families . Promise me that you will save us from death. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	14	The men agreed and said , “ We will trade our lives for yours . Don ’ t tell anyone what we are doing . Then , when the Lord gives us the land , we will be kind to you . You can trust us. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	15	Rahab ’ s house was built into the city wall , so she used a rope to let the men down through a window .
ERV	Joshua	2	16	Then she said to them , “ Go into the hills so that the king ’ s men will not accidentally find you . Hide there for three days . After the king ’ s men come back , you can go on your way. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	17	The men said to her , “ We made a promise to you . But you must do one thing , or we will not be responsible for our promise .
ERV	Joshua	2	18	When we come back to this land , you must tie in your window this red rope you are using to help us escape . You must bring your father , your mother , your brothers , and all your family into your house with you .
ERV	Joshua	2	19	We will protect everyone who stays in this house . If anyone in your house is hurt , we will be responsible . But if they go out of your house and are killed , we will not be responsible . It will be their own fault .
ERV	Joshua	2	20	We are making this agreement with you . But if you tell anyone about what we are doing , we will be free from this agreement. ”
ERV	Joshua	2	21	Rahab answered , “ I will do just what you said. ” She said goodbye , and the men left her house . Then she tied the red rope in the window .
ERV	Joshua	2	22	The men left her house and went into the hills . They stayed there for three days . The king ’ s men looked all along the road . After three days , they stopped looking and went back to the city .
ERV	Joshua	2	23	Then the two men went back to Joshua . They left the hills and crossed the river . They went to Joshua and told him everything that they had learned .
ERV	Joshua	2	24	They said to him , “ The Lord really has given us all the land . All the people in that country are afraid of us. ” Footnotes - Joshua 2:1 Acacia Or “ Shittim , ” a town east of the Jordan River . Also in 3:1 . - Joshua 2:6 flax A plant used to make linen .
ERV	Joshua	3	3	They gave orders to the people : “ When you see the Levite priests carrying the Box of the Agreement of the Lord your God , follow them .
ERV	Joshua	3	2	After three days the leaders went through the camp .
ERV	Joshua	3	4	But do not follow too closely . Stay about
ERV	Joshua	3	1000	yards Literally , “
ERV	Joshua	3	5	Then Joshua told the people , “ Make yourselves pure . Tomorrow the Lord will do amazing things among us. ”
ERV	Joshua	3	6	Then Joshua said to the priests , “ Take the Box of the Agreement and go across the river in front of the people. ” So the priests lifted the Box and carried it in front of the people .
ERV	Joshua	3	7	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I will begin to make you a great man for all the Israelites to see . Then the people will know that I am with you just as I was with Moses .
ERV	Joshua	3	8	The priests will carry the Box of the Agreement . Tell them this , ‘ Walk to the shore of the Jordan River and stop just before you step into the water. ’ ”
ERV	Joshua	3	9	Then Joshua said to the Israelites , “ Come and listen to the words of the Lord your God .
ERV	Joshua	3	10	Here is proof that the living God is really with you and that he will surely defeat your enemies . He will defeat the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites , and Jebusites ; he will force them to leave their land .
ERV	Joshua	3	11	The Box of the Agreement of the Lord of the whole world will go before you as you cross the Jordan River .
ERV	Joshua	3	12	Now choose twelve men , one from each of the twelve tribes of Israel .
ERV	Joshua	3	13	The priests will carry the Holy Box of the Lord . He is the Lord of the whole world . They will carry that Box in front of you into the Jordan River . When they enter the water , the water of the Jordan River will stop flowing and fill behind that place like at a dam. ”
ERV	Joshua	3	14	The priests carried the Box of the Agreement , and the people left the place they had camped . The people started going across the Jordan River .
ERV	Joshua	3	15	( During harvest time the Jordan River overflows its banks , so the river was at its fullest . ) The priests who were carrying the Box came to the shore of the river . When they stepped into the water ,
ERV	Joshua	3	16	immediately the water stopped flowing and piled up like a wall . The water piled up high a long way up the river—all the way to Adam ( a town near Zarethan ) . And the water flowing down to the sea of Arabah ( the Dead Sea ) was completely cut off . The people crossed the river near Jericho .
ERV	Joshua	3	17	The ground at that place became dry , and the priests carried the Box of the Agreement of the Lord to the middle of the river and stopped . They waited there while all the Israelites walked across the Jordan River on dry land . Footnotes - Joshua 3:4
ERV	Joshua	3	2000	cubits ” (
ERV	Joshua	3	888	m ) .
ERV	Joshua	4	4	So Joshua chose one man from each tribe . Then he called the twelve men together .
ERV	Joshua	4	2	“ Choose twelve men , one from each tribe .
ERV	Joshua	4	3	Tell them to look in the river where the priests were standing and get twelve rocks from that place . Carry these rocks with you and put them where you stay tonight. ”
ERV	Joshua	4	5	He said to them , “ Go out into the river where the Holy Box of the Lord your God is . Each of you must find one rock . There will be one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel . Carry that rock on your shoulder .
ERV	Joshua	4	6	These rocks will be a sign for you . In the future , your children will ask you , ‘ What do these rocks mean ? ’
ERV	Joshua	4	7	You will tell them that the Lord stopped the water from flowing in the Jordan River . When the Holy Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement crossed the river , the water stopped flowing . These rocks will help the Israelites remember this forever. ”
ERV	Joshua	4	8	So the Israelites obeyed Joshua . They carried twelve rocks from the middle of the Jordan River . There was one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel . They did this as the Lord had commanded Joshua . The men carried the rocks with them . Then they put the rocks at the place where they made their camp .
ERV	Joshua	4	9	Joshua also put twelve rocks in the middle of the Jordan River . He put them at the place where the priests had stood while carrying the Holy Box . These rocks are still there today .
ERV	Joshua	4	10	The Lord had commanded Joshua to tell the people what to do . This is what Moses had said Joshua must do . So the priests carrying the Holy Box stood in the middle of the river until everything was done . Meanwhile , the people hurried across the river .
ERV	Joshua	4	11	After the people finished crossing the river , the priests carried the Lord ’ s Holy Box to the front of the people .
ERV	Joshua	4	12	The men from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh obeyed Moses . These men crossed the river in front of the other people . These men were prepared for war . They were going to help the rest of the Israelites take the land God had promised to give them .
ERV	Joshua	4	13	About 40,000 soldiers , prepared for war , passed before the Lord . They were marching toward the plains of Jericho .
ERV	Joshua	4	14	That day the Lord made Joshua a great man to all the Israelites . From that time on , they respected Joshua just as they had Moses .
ERV	Joshua	4	15	Then the Lord said to Joshua ,
ERV	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests carrying the Box that holds the Agreement [ a ] to come out of the river. ”
ERV	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua commanded the priests , “ Come out of the Jordan River. ”
ERV	Joshua	4	18	The priests obeyed Joshua . They carried the Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement with them and came out of the river . When their feet touched the land on the other side of the river , the water in the river began flowing again . The water again overflowed its banks just as it had before the people crossed .
ERV	Joshua	4	19	The people crossed the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal , east of Jericho .
ERV	Joshua	4	20	They carried with them the twelve rocks that they had taken from the Jordan River , and Joshua set them up at Gilgal .
ERV	Joshua	4	21	Then Joshua told the Israelites , “ In the future your children will ask you , ‘ What do these rocks mean ? ’
ERV	Joshua	4	22	Tell them , ‘ These rocks help us remember the way the people of Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry land. ’
ERV	Joshua	4	23	The Lord your God caused the water in the Jordan River to stop flowing so that you could cross it on dry land—just as the Lord had stopped the water at the Red Sea so that we could cross it on dry land .
ERV	Joshua	4	24	The Lord did this so that all the people in this country would know that he is very powerful . Then they will always be afraid of the Lord your God. ” Footnotes - Joshua 4:16 Box that holds the Agreement Literally , “ Testimony. ” See “ Agreement ” in the Word List .
ERV	Joshua	5	5	So the Lord dried up the Jordan River until the Israelites finished crossing it . The kings of the Amorites living west of the Jordan River and the Canaanites living by the Mediterranean Sea heard about this and became very frightened . After that they were not brave enough to stand and fight against the Israelites . The Israelites Are Circumcised
ERV	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , “ Make knives from flint rocks and circumcise the men of Israel. ”
ERV	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made knives from flint rocks and circumcised the men of Israel at Gibeath Haaraloth . [ a ] 4-7 This is why Joshua circumcised the men : After the Israelites left Egypt , all the men who were able to serve in the army were circumcised . While in the desert , many of the fighting men did not listen to the Lord . So the Lord promised that they would not see the “ land where much food grows. ” He promised our ancestors to give us that land , but because of those men , he forced the people to wander in the desert for
ERV	Joshua	5	40	years . That way all those fighting men would die . So all the fighting men died , and their sons took their place . But none of the boys who were born in the desert on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised . So Joshua circumcised them .
ERV	Joshua	5	8	Joshua finished circumcising all the men . The people camped at that place until all the men were healed . First Passover in Canaan
ERV	Joshua	5	9	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ You were slaves in Egypt , and this made you ashamed . But today I have taken away that shame. ” So Joshua named that place Gilgal . [ b ] And that place is still named Gilgal today .
ERV	Joshua	5	10	The Israelites celebrated Passover while they were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho . This was on the evening of the 14th day of the month .
ERV	Joshua	5	11	The day after Passover , the people ate food that grew in that land . They ate bread made without yeast and roasted grain .
ERV	Joshua	5	12	The next morning , the manna from heaven stopped coming . This happened the first day after the people ate the food that grew in the land of Canaan . From that time on , the Israelites did not get the manna from heaven . The Commander of the Lord ’ s Army
ERV	Joshua	5	13	When Joshua was near Jericho , he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him . The man had a sword in his hand . Joshua went to the man and asked , “ Are you a friend to our people or are you one of our enemies ? ”
ERV	Joshua	5	14	The man answered , “ I am not an enemy . I am the commander of the Lord ’ s army . I have just now come to you. ” Then Joshua bowed his face to the ground to show respect and said , “ I am your servant . Does my master have a command for me ? ”
ERV	Joshua	5	15	The commander of the Lord ’ s army answered , “ Take off your sandals . The place where you are standing is holy. ” So Joshua obeyed him . Footnotes - Joshua 5:3 Gibeath Haaraloth This name means “ Circumcision Hill. ” - Joshua 5:9 Gilgal This name is like the Hebrew word meaning “ to roll away . ”
ERV	Joshua	6	6	So Joshua son of Nun called the priests together and said to them , “ Carry the Holy Box of the Lord . Tell seven priests to carry the trumpets and march in front of it. ”
ERV	Joshua	6	2	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Look , I will let you defeat the city of Jericho . You will defeat the king and all the fighting men in the city .
ERV	Joshua	6	3	March around the city with your army once every day for six days .
ERV	Joshua	6	4	Tell seven of the priests to carry trumpets made from the horns of male sheep and to march in front of the priests who are carrying the Holy Box . On the seventh day march around the city seven times and tell the priests to blow the trumpets while they march .
ERV	Joshua	6	5	They will make one loud noise from the trumpets . When you hear that noise , tell all the people to begin shouting . When you do this , the walls of the city will fall down and your people will be able to go straight into the city. ” The Battle Against Jericho
ERV	Joshua	6	7	Then Joshua ordered the people , “ Now go ! March around the city . The soldiers with weapons will march in front of the Holy Box of the Lord. ”
ERV	Joshua	6	8	After Joshua finished speaking to the people , the seven priests with the trumpets began marching before the Lord , blowing the trumpets as they marched . The priests carrying the Lord ’ s Holy Box followed them .
ERV	Joshua	6	9	The soldiers with weapons marched in front of the priests who were blowing the horns . And the rest of the men walked behind the Holy Box , marching and blowing their trumpets .
ERV	Joshua	6	10	Joshua had told the people not to give a war cry . He said , “ Don ’ t shout . Don ’ t say a word until the day I tell you . Then you will shout. ”
ERV	Joshua	6	11	So Joshua made the priests carry the Holy Box of the Lord around the city one time . Then they went back to the camp and spent the night there .
ERV	Joshua	6	12	Early the next morning Joshua got up , and the priests carried the Lord ’ s Holy Box again .
ERV	Joshua	6	13	The seven priests with the trumpets marched in front of the Lord ’ s Holy Box , blowing their trumpets . The soldiers with weapons marched in front of them . The rest of the people marched behind the Lord ’ s Holy Box . During the whole time they marched , the priests were blowing the trumpets .
ERV	Joshua	6	14	On the second day , they all marched around the city one time . And then they went back to the camp . They continued to do this every day for six days .
ERV	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day , they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times . They marched in the same way they had marched on the days before , but on that day they marched around the city seven times .
ERV	Joshua	6	16	The seventh time they marched around the city , the priests blew their trumpets . Then Joshua gave the command : “ Now , shout ! The Lord is giving you this city !
ERV	Joshua	6	17	The city and everything is to be destroyed as an offering to the Lord . Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone in her house will be left alive . These people must not be killed because she helped the two spies .
ERV	Joshua	6	18	Remember , we must destroy everything else . Don ’ t take anything . If you take anything and bring it into our camp , you yourselves will be destroyed , and you will cause trouble for the rest of our people .
ERV	Joshua	6	19	All the things made from silver , gold , bronze , and iron belong to the Lord . They must be put in the Lord ’ s treasury. ”
ERV	Joshua	6	20	So then the priests blew the trumpets . When the people heard the trumpets , they began shouting . The walls fell down , and the people ran up into the city . So the Israelites defeated that city .
ERV	Joshua	6	21	The people destroyed everything in the city . They destroyed everything that was living there . They killed the young and old men , the young and old women , and the cattle , sheep , and donkeys .
ERV	Joshua	6	22	Joshua talked to the two spies . He said , “ You made a promise to the prostitute . So go to her house and bring her out and all those who are with her. ”
ERV	Joshua	6	23	So the two men went into the house and brought out Rahab , her father , mother , brothers , all her family , and all those who were with her . They put all the people in a safe place outside the camp of Israel .
ERV	Joshua	6	24	Then the Israelites burned the whole city and everything in it except for the things made from silver , gold , bronze , and iron . They put these things in the Lord ’ s treasury .
ERV	Joshua	6	25	Joshua saved Rahab the prostitute , her family , and all those who were with her . Joshua let them live because Rahab helped the spies Joshua had sent out to Jericho . Rahab still lives among the Israelites today .
ERV	Joshua	6	26	At that time Joshua made this important promise . He said , “ Whoever rebuilds Jericho will be in danger from the Lord . When he lays the foundation , he will lose his oldest son . When he sets up the gates , he will lose his youngest son. ” [ a ]
ERV	Joshua	6	27	So the Lord was with Joshua , and Joshua became famous throughout the whole country . Footnotes - Joshua 6:26 When he … son See
ERV	Joshua	6	1	Kings 16:34 .
ERV	Joshua	7	7	Joshua said , “ Lord God , you brought our people across the Jordan River . Why did you bring us this far and then allow the Amorites to destroy us ? We should have been satisfied and stayed on the other side of the Jordan River .
ERV	Joshua	7	2	After they defeated Jericho , Joshua sent some men to Ai . [ a ] Ai was near Beth Aven , east of Bethel . He told them , “ Go to Ai and look for weaknesses in that area. ” So the men went to spy on that land .
ERV	Joshua	7	3	Later , the men came back to Joshua . They said , “ Ai is a weak area . We will not need all of our people to defeat them . Send
ERV	Joshua	7	2000	or
ERV	Joshua	7	3000	men went to Ai , but the people of Ai killed about
ERV	Joshua	7	36	men of Israel . And the Israelites ran away . The people of Ai chased them from the city gates all the way to the quarries . [ b ] The people of Ai beat them badly . When the people from Israel saw this , they became very frightened and lost their courage .
ERV	Joshua	7	6	When Joshua heard about this , he tore his clothes to show his sadness . He bowed down to the ground before the Holy Box and stayed there until evening . The leaders of Israel did the same thing . They also threw dirt on their heads to show their sadness .
ERV	Joshua	7	8	I promise by my life , Lord ! There is nothing I can say now . Israel has surrendered to the enemy .
ERV	Joshua	7	9	The Canaanites and all the other people in this country will hear about what happened . Then they will attack us and kill all of us ! Then what will you do to protect your great name ? ”
ERV	Joshua	7	10	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Why are you down there with your face on the ground ? Stand up !
ERV	Joshua	7	11	The Israelites sinned against me . They have broken the agreement that I commanded them to obey . They took some of the things that I commanded them to destroy . They have stolen from me . They have lied . They have taken those things for themselves .
ERV	Joshua	7	12	That is why the army of Israel turned and ran away from the fight . They did that because they have done wrong . They should be destroyed . I will not continue to help you or be with you unless you destroy everything I commanded you to destroy .
ERV	Joshua	7	13	“ Now go and make the people pure . Tell them , ‘ Make yourselves pure . Prepare for tomorrow . The Lord , the God of Israel , says that some people are keeping things that he commanded to be destroyed . You will never be able to defeat your enemies until you throw away those things .
ERV	Joshua	7	14	“ Tomorrow morning you must all stand before the Lord . All the tribes will stand before the Lord , and he will choose one tribe . Only that tribe will stand before him . Then the Lord will choose one family group from that tribe . Only that family group must stand before him . Then he will look at each family in that family group , and the Lord will choose one family . Then he will look at each man in that family .
ERV	Joshua	7	15	The man who is keeping those things that we should have destroyed will be caught . Then he will be destroyed by fire , and everything that he owns will be destroyed with him . He broke the agreement with the Lord . He has done a very bad thing to the Israelites ! ”
ERV	Joshua	7	16	Early the next morning , Joshua led out all the Israelites . Each tribe came forward to stand before the Lord , and he chose the tribe of Judah .
ERV	Joshua	7	17	So then all the family groups of Judah stood before the Lord , and he chose the Zerah family group . Then all the families of the Zerah group stood before the Lord , and he chose the family of Zimri .
ERV	Joshua	7	18	Then Joshua told all the men in that family to come before the Lord . He chose Achan the son of Carmi . ( Carmi was the son of Zimri . And Zimri was the son of Zerah . )
ERV	Joshua	7	19	Then Joshua said to Achan , “ Son , you must honor the Lord , the God of Israel . Praise him and confess your sins to him . Tell me what you did , and don ’ t try to hide anything from me. ”
ERV	Joshua	7	20	Achan answered , “ It is true ! I sinned against the Lord , the God of Israel . This is what I did :
ERV	Joshua	7	21	In Jericho , I saw a beautiful coat from Babylonia , [ c ] about
ERV	Joshua	7	5	pounds Literally , “
ERV	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent some men to the tent . They ran to the tent and found the things hidden there . The silver was under the coat .
ERV	Joshua	7	23	The men brought the things out of the tent and took them to Joshua and all the Israelites . They threw them on the ground before the Lord .
ERV	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua and all the people led Achan son of Zerah to the Valley of Achor . They also took the silver , the coat , the gold , Achan ’ s sons and daughters , his cattle , his donkeys , his sheep , his tent , and everything he owned . They took all these things to the Valley of Achor with Achan .
ERV	Joshua	7	25	Then Joshua said , “ You caused much trouble for us , but now the Lord will bring trouble to you. ” Then all the people threw stones at Achan and his family until they died . Then the people burned them and everything he owned .
ERV	Joshua	7	26	After they burned Achan , they put many rocks over his body . The rocks are still there today . That is why it is called the Valley of Achor . [ f ] After this the Lord was not angry with the people .

ERV	Joshua	8	8	“ You must do what the Lord says . Watch me and I will give you the command to attack the city . When you have taken control of the city , burn it. ”
ERV	Joshua	8	2	You will do to Ai and its king the same thing you did to Jericho and its king . Only this time you can take all the wealth and animals and keep it for yourselves . You will share the wealth with your people . Now , tell some of your soldiers to hide behind the city. ”
ERV	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua led his whole army toward Ai . Then Joshua chose 30,000 of his best fighting men and sent them out at night .
ERV	Joshua	8	4	Joshua gave them this command : “ Listen carefully to what I tell you . You must hide in the area behind the city . Wait for the time to attack . Don ’ t go far from the city . Continue to watch and be ready .
ERV	Joshua	8	5	I will lead the men with me ; we will march toward the city . The men in the city will come out to fight against us . We will turn and run away from them as we did before .
ERV	Joshua	8	6	These men will chase us away from the city , so we will run away . They will think that we are running away from them as we did before .
ERV	Joshua	8	7	Then you should come out of your hiding place and take control of the city . The Lord your God will give you the power to win .
ERV	Joshua	8	9	Then Joshua sent them to their hiding place and waited . They went to a place west of Ai , between Bethel and Ai . But Joshua stayed the night with his people .
ERV	Joshua	8	10	Early the next morning Joshua gathered the men together . Then Joshua and the leaders of Israel led the men to Ai .
ERV	Joshua	8	11	All the soldiers who were with Joshua marched to Ai . They stopped in front of the city . The army made its camp north of the city . There was a valley between the army and Ai .
ERV	Joshua	8	12	Then Joshua chose about
ERV	Joshua	8	5000	men . He sent these men to hide in the area west of the city , between Bethel and Ai .
ERV	Joshua	8	13	So Joshua had prepared his men for the fight . The main camp was north of the city . The other men were hiding to the west . That night Joshua went down into the valley .
ERV	Joshua	8	14	Later , the king of Ai saw the army of Israel . The king and his people hurried out to fight the army of Israel . The king of Ai went out the east side of the city toward the Jordan Valley , so he did not see the soldiers hiding behind the city .
ERV	Joshua	8	15	Joshua and all the men of Israel let the army of Ai push them back . Joshua and his men began running east toward the desert .
ERV	Joshua	8	16	The people in the city began to shout and started to chase them . All the people left the city .
ERV	Joshua	8	17	All the men of Ai and Bethel chased the army of Israel . The city was left open—no one stayed to protect the city .
ERV	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Hold your spear toward the city of Ai , because I will give you that city. ” So Joshua held his spear toward the city of Ai .
ERV	Joshua	8	19	When the Israelites who were hiding saw this , they quickly came out from their hiding place and hurried toward the city . They entered the city and took control of it . Then the soldiers started fires to burn the city .
ERV	Joshua	8	20	The men from Ai looked back and saw their city burning . When they saw the smoke rising into the sky , they lost their strength and courage . They stopped chasing the men of Israel . The Israelites stopped running away . They turned and went to fight the men from Ai . There was no safe place for the men from Ai to run to .
ERV	Joshua	8	21	When Joshua and his men saw that his army had taken control of the city and that smoke was rising from it , they stopped running away and turned to fight the men of Ai .
ERV	Joshua	8	22	Then the men who were hiding came out of the city to help with the fight . The army of Israel was on both sides of the men of Ai—the men of Ai were trapped . Israel defeated them . They fought until none of the men from Ai were left alive—none of the enemy escaped .
ERV	Joshua	8	23	But the king of Ai was left alive . Joshua ’ s men brought him to Joshua . A Review of the Fighting
ERV	Joshua	8	24	During the fighting , the army of Israel chased the men from Ai into the fields and into the desert . So the army of Israel finished killing all the men from Ai in the fields and in the desert . Then the Israelites went back to Ai and killed all the people who were still alive in the city .
ERV	Joshua	8	25	All the people of Ai died that day ; there were 12,000 men and women .
ERV	Joshua	8	26	Joshua had held his spear toward Ai as a sign to his people to destroy the city . And he did not stop until all the people of Ai were destroyed .
ERV	Joshua	8	27	The Israelites kept the animals and other things from the city for themselves . This is what the Lord said they could do when he gave Joshua the commands .
ERV	Joshua	8	28	Then Joshua burned the city of Ai . That city became an empty pile of rocks . It is still like that today .
ERV	Joshua	8	29	Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left him hanging there until evening . At sunset Joshua told his men to take the king ’ s body down from the tree . They threw his body down at the city gate . Then they covered the body with many rocks . That pile of rocks is still there today . Reading the Blessings and Curses
ERV	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar for the Lord , the God of Israel . He built the altar on Mount Ebal .
ERV	Joshua	8	31	The Lord ’ s servant Moses told the Israelites how to build altars . So Joshua built the altar the way it was explained in the Book of the Law [ b ] of Moses . The altar was made from stones that were not cut . No tool had ever been used on those stones . They offered burnt offerings to the Lord on that altar . They also gave fellowship offerings .
ERV	Joshua	8	32	,
ERV	Joshua	8	33	The elders , officers , judges , and all the Israelites were standing around the Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement . They were standing in front of the priests , the Levites who carried the Holy Box . The Israelites and the other people with them were all standing there . Half of the people stood in front of Mount Ebal and the other half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim . The Lord ’ s servant Moses had told the people to do this . He told them to do this to be blessed .
ERV	Joshua	8	34	.
ERV	Joshua	8	35	All the Israelites were gathered together there . All the women and children and all the foreigners who lived with the Israelites were there . And Joshua read every command that Moses had given . Footnotes - Joshua 8:1 Ai See Josh . 7:2 . The name of this town means “ the ruins. ” - Joshua 8:31 Law Or “ Teachings. ” Also in verses
ERV	Joshua	9	9	The men answered , “ We are your servants . We have come from a faraway country . We came because we heard of the great power of the Lord your God . We heard about what he has done and about everything he did in Egypt .
ERV	Joshua	9	2	All these kings came together and made plans to fight against Joshua and the Israelites .
ERV	Joshua	9	3	The people from the city of Gibeon heard about the way Joshua had defeated Jericho and Ai .
ERV	Joshua	9	4	So they decided to try to trick the Israelites . This was their plan : They gathered together old wineskins that were cracked and broken . They put these old wineskins on the backs of their animals . They put old pieces of cloth on their animals to look as if they had traveled from far away .
ERV	Joshua	9	5	The men put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes . They found some old bread that was dry and moldy .
ERV	Joshua	9	6	Then they went to the camp of the Israelites . This camp was near Gilgal . The men went to Joshua and said to him , “ We have traveled from a faraway country . We want to make a peace agreement with you. ”
ERV	Joshua	9	7	The men of Israel said to these Hivite men , “ Maybe you are trying to trick us . Maybe you live near us . We can not make a peace agreement with you until we know where you are from. ”
ERV	Joshua	9	8	The Hivite men said to Joshua , “ We are your servants. ” But Joshua asked , “ Who are you ? Where do you come from ? ”
ERV	Joshua	9	10	And we heard that he defeated the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan River . This was King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan in the land of Ashtaroth .
ERV	Joshua	9	11	So our elders and our people said to us , ‘ Take enough food for your journey . Go and meet with the Israelites. ’ Tell them , ‘ We are your servants . Make a peace agreement with us. ’
ERV	Joshua	9	12	“ Look at our bread . When we left home , it was warm and fresh . But now you can see that it is dry and old .
ERV	Joshua	9	13	Look at our wineskins . When we left home , they were new and filled with wine . But now you can see that they are cracked and old . Look at our clothes and sandals . You can see that the long journey has almost destroyed the things we wear. ”
ERV	Joshua	9	14	The men of Israel wanted to know if these men were telling the truth . So they tasted the bread—but they did not ask the Lord what they should do .
ERV	Joshua	9	15	Joshua agreed to make peace with them . He agreed to let them live . The leaders of Israel agreed with this promise of Joshua .
ERV	Joshua	9	16	Three days later the Israelites learned that these men lived very near their camp .
ERV	Joshua	9	17	So the Israelites went to the place where they lived . On the third day the Israelites came to the cities of Gibeon , Kephirah , Beeroth , and Kiriath Jearim .
ERV	Joshua	9	18	But the army of Israel did not try to fight against those cities . They had made a peace agreement with them . They had made a promise to them before the Lord , the God of Israel . All the people complained against the leaders who made the agreement .
ERV	Joshua	9	19	But the leaders answered , “ We have given our promise . We promised before the Lord , the God of Israel . We can not fight against them now .
ERV	Joshua	9	20	This is what we must do . We must let them live . We can not hurt them or God will be angry with us because we broke the promise we made to them .
ERV	Joshua	9	21	So let them live , but they will be our servants . They will cut wood for us and carry water for all our people. ” So the leaders did not break their promise of peace to them .
ERV	Joshua	9	22	Joshua called the Gibeonites together . He said , “ Why did you lie to us ? Your land was near our camp . But you told us you were from a faraway country .
ERV	Joshua	9	23	Now , your people will have many troubles . All of your people will be slaves—they will have to cut wood and carry water for the house of God . [ a ] ”
ERV	Joshua	9	24	The Gibeonites answered , “ We lied to you because we were afraid you would kill us . We heard that God commanded his servant Moses to give you all this land . And God told you to kill all the people who lived in this land . That is why we lied to you .
ERV	Joshua	9	25	Now we are your servants . You can do whatever you think is right. ”
ERV	Joshua	9	26	So the Gibeonites became slaves , but Joshua let them live . He did not allow the Israelites to kill them .
ERV	Joshua	9	27	He made them slaves of the Israelites . They cut wood and carried water for the Israelites and for the altar of the Lord—wherever the Lord chose it to be . They are still slaves today . Footnotes - Joshua 9:23 house of God This might mean the “ family of God ” ( Israel ) , “ the Holy Tent , ” or “ the Temple . ”
ERV	Joshua	10	10	The Lord caused those armies to be very confused when Israel attacked . So Israel defeated them and won a great victory . Israel chased the enemy from Gibeon along the road going up to Beth Horon . The army of Israel killed men all the way to Azekah and Makkedah .
ERV	Joshua	10	2	So Adoni Zedek and his people were very frightened . Gibeon was not a small town like Ai . It was a very big city—as big as any royal city . [ a ] And all the men in that city were good fighters , so the king was afraid .
ERV	Joshua	10	3	King Adoni Zedek of Jerusalem talked with King Hoham of Hebron . He also talked with King Piram of Jarmuth , King Japhia of Lachish , and King Debir of Eglon . The king of Jerusalem begged these men ,
ERV	Joshua	10	4	“ Come with me and help me attack Gibeon . Gibeon has made a peace agreement with Joshua and the Israelites. ”
ERV	Joshua	10	5	So these five Amorite kings joined their armies together . ( The five kings were the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , and the king of Eglon . ) Their armies went to Gibeon , surrounded the city , and began fighting against it .
ERV	Joshua	10	6	The people in the city of Gibeon sent a message to Joshua at his camp at Gilgal : “ We are your servants ! Don ’ t leave us alone . Come and help us ! Hurry ! Save us ! All the Amorite kings from the hill country have brought their armies together to fight against us. ”
ERV	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua marched out of Gilgal with his whole army . His best fighting men were with him .
ERV	Joshua	10	8	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Don ’ t be afraid of those armies . I will allow you to defeat them . None of them will be able to defeat you. ”
ERV	Joshua	10	9	Joshua and his army marched all night to Gibeon , so it was a complete surprise when he attacked them .
ERV	Joshua	10	11	Then they chased the enemy down the road from Beth Horon to Azekah . While they were chasing the enemy , the Lord caused large hailstones to fall from the sky . Many of the enemy were killed by these large hailstones . More men were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the soldiers of Israel .
ERV	Joshua	10	12	On that day the Lord gave Israel the victory against the Amorites . Joshua stood before all the Israelites and said to the Lord : “ Sun , stop over Gibeon . Moon , stand still over the Valley of Aijalon. ”
ERV	Joshua	10	13	So the sun did not move , and the moon stopped until the people defeated their enemies . This story is written in the Book of Jashar . The sun stopped in the middle of the sky . It did not move for a full day .
ERV	Joshua	10	14	That had never happened before , and it has never happened again . That was the day the Lord obeyed a man . The Lord really was fighting for Israel !
ERV	Joshua	10	15	After this , Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal .
ERV	Joshua	10	16	But during the fight , the five kings ran away . They hid in a cave near Makkedah ,
ERV	Joshua	10	17	but someone found them hiding in that cave . Joshua learned about this .
ERV	Joshua	10	18	He said , “ Cover the entrance to the cave with large rocks . Put some men there to guard the cave .
ERV	Joshua	10	19	But don ’ t stay there yourselves . Continue chasing the enemy and attacking them from behind . Don ’ t let the enemy get back to their cities . The Lord your God has given you the victory over them. ”

ERV	Joshua	10	21	After the fighting , Joshua ’ s men came back to him at Makkedah . Not one of the people in that country was brave enough to say anything against the Israelites .
ERV	Joshua	10	22	Joshua said , “ Move the rocks that are covering the entrance to the cave . Bring the five kings to me. ”

ERV	Joshua	10	41	Joshua captured all the cities from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza . He captured all the cities from Goshen [ b ] to Gibeon .

ERV	Joshua	11	5	All these kings met together at the small river of Merom . They joined their armies together into one camp and made plans for the battle against Israel .

ERV	Joshua	11	14	The Israelites kept for themselves all the things and all the animals they found in the cities . But they killed all the people there . They left no one alive .

ERV	Joshua	14	6	One day some people from the tribe of Judah went to Joshua at Gilgal . One of them was Caleb , the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite .

ERV	Joshua	14	7	Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , sent me to look at the land where we were going . I was
ERV	Joshua	14	40	years old at that time . When I came back , I told Moses what I thought about the land .
ERV	Joshua	14	8	The other men who went with me told the people things that made them afraid . But I really believed that the Lord would allow us to take that land .
ERV	Joshua	14	9	So that day Moses made a promise to me . He said , ‘ The land where you went will become your land . Your children will own that land forever . I will give you that land because you really believed in the Lord , my God. ’
ERV	Joshua	14	10	“ Now the Lord has kept me alive for
ERV	Joshua	14	45	more years—as he said he would . During that time we all wandered in the desert . Now , here I am ,
ERV	Joshua	14	85	years old .
ERV	Joshua	14	11	I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out . I am as ready to fight as I was then .
ERV	Joshua	14	12	So give me the hill country that the Lord promised me that day long ago . At that time you heard that the strong Anakites lived there and the cities were very big and well protected . But now , maybe the Lord will be with me , and I will take that land just as the Lord said. ”
ERV	Joshua	14	13	Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh . Joshua gave him the city of Hebron as his own .

ERV	Joshua	15	3	The border went south to Scorpion Pass and continued on to Zin . Then the border continued south to Kadesh Barnea . It continued past Hezron to Addar . From Addar the border turned and continued to Karka .
ERV	Joshua	15	4	The border continued to Azmon , the brook of Egypt , and then to the Mediterranean Sea . All that land was on their southern border .
ERV	Joshua	15	5	Their eastern border was the shore of the Dead Sea to the area where the Jordan River flowed into the sea . Their northern border started at the area where the Jordan River flowed into the Dead Sea .

ERV	Joshua	15	11	Then the border went to the hill north of Ekron . From there the border turned to Shikkeron and went past Mount Baalah . The border continued on to Jabneel and ended at the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Joshua	15	12	The Mediterranean Sea was the western border . So the land of Judah was inside these four borders . The families of Judah lived in this area .
ERV	Joshua	15	13	The Lord had commanded Joshua to give Caleb son of Jephunneh part of the land in Judah . So Joshua gave Caleb the land God had commanded . Joshua gave him the town of Kiriath Arba , that is , Hebron . ( Arba was the father of Anak . )

ERV	Joshua	15	19	Acsah answered , “ Give me a blessing . [ b ] You gave me dry desert land in the Negev . Please give me some land with water on it. ” So Caleb gave her what she wanted . He gave her the upper and lower pools of water in that land .

ERV	Joshua	16	3	Then the border went west to the border of the Japhletites . The border continued to Lower Beth Horon . Then the border went to Gezer and continued to the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Joshua	16	4	So the people of Manasseh and Ephraim got their land . ( Manasseh and Ephraim were sons of Joseph . )
ERV	Joshua	16	5	This is the land that was given to the people of Ephraim : Their eastern border started at Ataroth Addar near Upper Beth Horon .
ERV	Joshua	16	6	And the western border started at Micmethath . The border turned to the east to Taanath Shiloh and continued east to Janoah .
ERV	Joshua	16	7	Then it went from Janoah down to Ataroth and to Naarah . The border continued until it touched Jericho and ended at the Jordan River .
ERV	Joshua	16	8	The border went from Tappuah west to Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea . This is all the land that was given to the Ephraimites . Each family in that tribe got a part of this land .
ERV	Joshua	16	9	Many of the border towns of Ephraim were actually in Manasseh ’ s borders , but the Ephraimites got the towns and the fields around them .
ERV	Joshua	16	10	But the Ephraimites were not able to force the Canaanites to leave the town of Gezer . So the Canaanites still live among the Ephraimites today , although they did become slaves of the Ephraimites .
ERV	Joshua	17	17	Then Joshua said to the people of Joseph , the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh , “ You have many people and you are very strong , so you should get more than one share of the land .
ERV	Joshua	17	2	Land was also given to the other families in the tribe of Manasseh . These families were Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher , and Shemida . All these men were the other sons of Manasseh , the son of Joseph . The families of these men got their share of the land .
ERV	Joshua	17	3	Zelophehad was the son of Hepher . Hepher was the son of Gilead . Gilead was the son of Makir , and Makir was the son of Manasseh . Zelophehad did not have any sons , but he had five daughters . The daughters were named Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milcah , and Tirzah .
ERV	Joshua	17	4	The daughters went to Eleazar the priest , Joshua son of Nun , and all the leaders . The daughters said , “ The Lord told Moses to give us land the same as our male relatives. ” So Eleazar obeyed the Lord and gave the daughters some land , just like their uncles .
ERV	Joshua	17	5	So the tribe of Manasseh had ten areas of land west of the Jordan River and two more areas of land , Gilead and Bashan , on the other side of the Jordan River .
ERV	Joshua	17	6	So these women from the tribe of Manasseh got land the same as the men . The land of Gilead was given to the rest of the families of Manasseh .
ERV	Joshua	17	7	The lands of Manasseh were in the area between Asher and Micmethath . This is near Shechem . The border went south to the En Tappuah area .
ERV	Joshua	17	8	The land around Tappuah belonged to Manasseh , but the town itself did not . The town of Tappuah was at the border of Manasseh ’ s land , and it belonged to the people of Ephraim .
ERV	Joshua	17	9	The border of Manasseh continued south to Kanah Ravine . This area belonged to the tribe of Manasseh , but the cities belonged to the people of Ephraim . Manasseh ’ s border was on the north side of the river and it continued west to the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Joshua	17	10	The land to the south belonged to Ephraim . And the land to the north belonged to Manasseh . The Mediterranean Sea was the western border . The border touched Asher ’ s land in the north and Issachar ’ s land in the east .
ERV	Joshua	17	11	The people of Manasseh had towns in the area of Issachar and Asher . Beth Shean , Ibleam , and the small towns around them also belonged to them . The people of Manasseh also lived in Dor , Endor , Taanach , Megiddo , and the small towns around these cities . They also lived in the three towns of Naphoth .
ERV	Joshua	17	12	The people of Manasseh were not able to defeat those cities . So the Canaanites continued to live there .
ERV	Joshua	17	13	But the Israelites grew strong . When this happened , they forced the Canaanites to work for them . But they did not force them to leave that land .
ERV	Joshua	17	14	The tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua and said , “ You gave us only one area of land , but we are many people . Why did you give us only one part of all the land that the Lord gave his people ? ”
ERV	Joshua	17	15	Joshua answered them , “ If you have too many people , go up to the wooded area in the hill country and clear that land for a place to live . That land now belongs to the Perizzites and the Rephaites . But if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you , go take that land. ”
ERV	Joshua	17	16	The people of Joseph said , “ It is true that the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for us . But the Canaanites living there have powerful weapons—they have iron chariots ! And they control Jezreel Valley , Beth Shean , and all the small towns in that area. ”
ERV	Joshua	17	18	You will take these mountains . It is a forest , but you can cut down the trees and make it a good place to live . You can take it from the Canaanites and force them to leave . You can defeat them , even if they are strong and have iron chariots. ” Footnotes - Joshua 17:1 father of Gilead Or “ the leader of the area of Gilead . ”
ERV	Joshua	18	18	It continued to the northern part of Beth Arabah . Then the border went down into the Jordan Valley .
ERV	Joshua	18	2	But at this time there were still seven tribes of Israel that had not yet received their land .
ERV	Joshua	18	3	So Joshua said to the Israelites , “ Why do you wait so long to take your land ? The Lord , the God of your ancestors , has given this land to you .
ERV	Joshua	18	4	So each of your tribes should choose three men . I will send them out to study the land . They will describe that land , and then they will come back to me .
ERV	Joshua	18	5	They will divide the land into seven parts . The people of Judah will keep their land in the south . The people of Joseph will keep their land in the north .
ERV	Joshua	18	6	But you should describe the land and divide it into seven parts . Bring the map to me , and we will throw lots to let the Lord our God decide how to divide the land among the tribes .
ERV	Joshua	18	7	The Levites don ’ t get a share of the land . Their share is to serve the Lord as priests . Gad , Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the land that was promised to them . They are on the east side of the Jordan River . Moses , the Lord ’ s servant , gave them that land. ”
ERV	Joshua	18	8	So the men who were chosen went to look at the land and write down what they saw . Joshua told them , “ Go through the land and describe it in writing . Then come back to me at Shiloh . I will throw lots and let the Lord decide how you will share the land. ”
ERV	Joshua	18	9	So the men went into the land . As they walked through it , they wrote down what they saw . They listed all the cities and divided the land into seven parts . Then they went back to Joshua at Shiloh .
ERV	Joshua	18	10	Joshua threw lots for them in front of the Lord at Shiloh . In this way Joshua divided the land and gave each tribe its part of the land . Land for Benjamin
ERV	Joshua	18	11	The tribe of Benjamin was given the land that was between the areas of Judah and Joseph . Each family in the tribe of Benjamin got its land . This is the land that was chosen for Benjamin :

ERV	Joshua	18	17	There it turned north , went to En Shemesh , and then continued on to Geliloth . ( Geliloth is near the Adummim Pass in the mountains . ) The border went down to the Great Stone that was named for Bohan , the son of Reuben .
ERV	Joshua	18	19	Then it went to the northern part of Beth Hoglah and ended at the north shore of the Dead Sea . This is where the Jordan River flows into that sea . That was the southern border .

So the people of Dan went to the northern part of Israel and fought against Laish . [ b ] They defeated Laish and killed the people who lived there . So the people of Dan lived in the town of Laish .

Footnotes - Joshua 19:28 Abdon Or “ Ebron. ” - Joshua 19:47 Laish Or “ Leshem. ” - Joshua 19:50 Timnath Serah Or “ Timnath Heres . ”
ERV	Joshua	20	20	Then the Lord said to Joshua :
ERV	Joshua	20	2	“ Through Moses , I told you to choose some cities to be cities of safety .
ERV	Joshua	20	3	Anyone who kills someone accidentally can go to a city of safety to hide from the relatives who want to kill him .
ERV	Joshua	20	4	“ If you accidentally kill someone and you run away to one of those cities , you must stop at the entrance of the city and tell the leaders of the people what happened . Then the leaders can allow you to enter the city . They will give you a place to live among them .
ERV	Joshua	20	5	If someone chases you and follows you to that city , the leaders of the city must not give you up . They must protect you because you came to them for safety after killing someone by accident—you were not angry and did not plan to kill the person . It was something that just happened .
ERV	Joshua	20	6	You should stay in that city until the court has judged you and until the high priest dies . Then you may go back to your hometown. ”
ERV	Joshua	20	7	So the Israelites chose some cities to be called cities of safety . These are the cities : Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali ; Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim ; Kiriath Arba ( Hebron ) in the hill country of Judah ;
ERV	Joshua	20	8	Bezer , east of the Jordan River across from Jericho , in the desert area in the land of Reuben ; Ramoth in Gilead in the land of Gad ; and Golan in Bashan in the land of Manasseh .
ERV	Joshua	20	9	All Israelites or any foreigners living among them who killed someone by accident were allowed to run away to one of these cities of safety . They could be safe there and not be killed by anyone chasing them . The court in that city would judge them .
ERV	Joshua	21	21	the city of Shechem from the hill country of Ephraim ( which was a city of safety ) , Gezer ,
ERV	Joshua	21	2	At Shiloh in the land of Canaan , the Levite rulers said to them , “ The Lord gave Moses a command . He commanded that you give us towns to live in and that you give us fields where our animals can eat. ”
ERV	Joshua	21	3	So the Israelites obeyed this command from the Lord and gave the Levites these towns and the land around them for their animals :
ERV	Joshua	21	4	The Kohath family groups were descendants of Aaron the priest from the tribe of Levi . Part of the Kohath family was given

ERV	Joshua	21	7	The people from the Merari family were given
ERV	Joshua	21	12	towns .
ERV	Joshua	21	8	So the Israelites gave the Levites these towns and the fields around them , just as the Lord had told Moses .
ERV	Joshua	21	9	These are the names of the towns that were in the areas that belonged to Judah and Simeon .
ERV	Joshua	21	10	The first choice of towns was given to the Levites from the Kohath family group .
ERV	Joshua	21	11	They gave them Kiriath Arba . ( This is Hebron . It was named for a man named Arba . Arba was the father of Anak . ) They also gave them some land near the town for their animals .
ERV	Joshua	21	14	Jattir , Eshtemoa ,
ERV	Joshua	21	15	Holon , Debir ,
ERV	Joshua	21	16	Ain , Juttah , and Beth Shemesh . They also gave them some of the land near these towns for their animals . These two tribes gave them nine towns .
ERV	Joshua	21	17	They also gave Aaron ’ s descendants cities that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin . These cities were Gibeon , Geba ,
ERV	Joshua	21	18	Anathoth , and Almon . They gave them these four towns and some of the land near the towns for their animals .
ERV	Joshua	21	19	In all , they gave
ERV	Joshua	21	20	The other people from the Kohathite family groups were given towns that were in the areas that belonged to the tribe of Ephraim . They got these towns :
ERV	Joshua	21	22	Kibzaim , and Beth Horon . In all , Ephraim gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
ERV	Joshua	21	23	The tribe of Dan gave them Eltekeh , Gibbethon ,

ERV	Joshua	21	26	In all , the rest of the people from the Kohath family groups got ten towns and some land around each town for their animals .
ERV	Joshua	21	27	The Gershon family groups were also from the tribe of Levi . They got these towns : Half the tribe of Manasseh gave them Golan in Bashan . ( Golan was a city of safety . ) Manasseh also gave them Be Eshtarah . In all , this half of Manasseh gave them two towns and some land around each town for their animals .
ERV	Joshua	21	28	The tribe of Issachar gave them Kishion , Daberath ,
ERV	Joshua	21	29	Jarmuth , and En Gannim . In all , Issachar gave them four towns and some land around each town for their animals .
ERV	Joshua	21	30	The tribe of Asher gave them Mishal , Abdon ,

ERV	Joshua	21	33	In all , the Gershon family groups got
ERV	Joshua	21	40	In all , the last family of Levites , the Merari family , got
ERV	Joshua	21	41	So the Levites were given a total of
ERV	Joshua	21	48	towns and some land around each town for their animals . All these towns were in areas that belonged to the other tribes .
ERV	Joshua	21	42	Each of these towns had some land in it for their animals . That was true for every town .
ERV	Joshua	21	43	So the Lord kept the promise that he had made to the Israelites and gave the people all the land that he had promised . The people took the land and lived there .
ERV	Joshua	21	44	And the Lord allowed them to have peace on all sides of their land , just as he had promised their ancestors . None of their enemies defeated them . The Lord allowed the Israelites to defeat every enemy .
ERV	Joshua	21	45	The Lord kept every promise that he made to the Israelites . There were no promises that he failed to keep . Every promise came true .
ERV	Joshua	22	22	“ The Lord is our God ! [ a ] Again we say that the Lord is our God ! And God knows why we did this thing . We want you to know also . You can judge what we did . If you think we did it because we are against the Lord or refuse to obey him , you can kill us today .
ERV	Joshua	22	2	Joshua said to them , “ Moses was the Lord ’ s servant . You obeyed everything that Moses told you to do . And you also obeyed all of my commands .
ERV	Joshua	22	3	All this time you have supported all the other Israelites . You carefully obeyed all the commands that the Lord your God gave you .
ERV	Joshua	22	4	The Lord your God promised to give the Israelites peace . And now , he has kept his promise , so now you can go home . The Lord ’ s servant Moses gave you the land on the east side of the Jordan River . Now you can go home to that land .
ERV	Joshua	22	5	But remember—continue to obey the law that the Lord ’ s servant Moses gave you . You must love the Lord your God and obey his commands . You must continue to follow him and serve him the very best that you can. ”
ERV	Joshua	22	6	Then Joshua said goodbye to them , and they left and went home .
ERV	Joshua	22	7	Moses had given the land of Bashan to half of the Manasseh tribe . Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan River to the other half of the Manasseh tribe . Joshua blessed them and sent them home .
ERV	Joshua	22	8	He said , “ You have become very rich . You have many animals . You have gold , silver , and expensive jewelry . You have many beautiful clothes . You have taken many things from your enemies . Go home and divide these things among yourselves. ”
ERV	Joshua	22	9	So the people from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh left the other Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan . They went back home to Gilead . This was their own land , the land that Moses gave them , as the Lord had commanded .
ERV	Joshua	22	10	They went to the place called Geliloth , near the Jordan River in the land of Canaan . There they built a beautiful altar .
ERV	Joshua	22	11	But the other Israelites who were still at Shiloh heard about the altar that these three tribes built . They heard that the altar was at the border of Canaan at the place called Geliloth . It was near the Jordan River on Israel ’ s side .
ERV	Joshua	22	12	All the Israelites became very angry with these three tribes . They met together and decided to fight against them .
ERV	Joshua	22	13	So the Israelites sent some men to talk to the people of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh . The leader of these men was Phinehas , son of Eleazar the priest .
ERV	Joshua	22	14	They also sent ten of the leaders of the tribes there . There was one man from each family group of Israel who was at Shiloh .
ERV	Joshua	22	15	So these eleven men went to Gilead . They went to talk to the people of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh . The eleven men said to them ,
ERV	Joshua	22	16	“ All the Lord ’ s people sent us to ask you this : ‘ Why did you do this thing against the God of Israel ? Why did you stop following the Lord ? Why did you build an altar for yourselves ? You know that this is against the Lord ’ s command .
ERV	Joshua	22	17	Remember what happened at Peor ? Was the sin we committed there not bad enough ? Because of that sin , the Lord punished his people with a terrible sickness . And we are still suffering from that sin .
ERV	Joshua	22	18	And now you are doing the same thing . You are turning against the Lord . Will you refuse to follow the Lord ? If you don ’ t stop what you are doing , he will be angry with everyone in Israel .
ERV	Joshua	22	19	“ ‘ If your land is not a good place to worship God , come over to the Lord ’ s land . This is where the Lord ’ s Tent is . You can have some of the land and live here . But don ’ t turn against the Lord or against us by building another altar . We already have the altar of the Lord our God at the Meeting Tent .
ERV	Joshua	22	20	“ ‘ Remember how Achan son of Zerah refused to obey the command about things that must be destroyed . That one man broke God ’ s law , but all the Israelites were punished . Achan died because of his sin , but also many other people died. ’ ”
ERV	Joshua	22	21	The people from the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh answered the eleven men . They said ,
ERV	Joshua	22	23	Do you think we built our own altar because we want to turn away from the Lord ? Do you think we built another altar for burnt offerings , grain offerings , and fellowship offerings ? If that is why we built this altar , we ask the Lord himself to punish us .
ERV	Joshua	22	24	But that is not why we built it . We built it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants might not accept us as part of God ’ s people . So your children might say to our children , ‘ You people have no reason to worship the Lord , the God of Israel .
ERV	Joshua	22	25	The Lord separated you people of Reuben and Gad from us by giving you the land on the other side of the Jordan River . So you are not part of the Lord ’ s people. ’ If your children said that , it might make our children stop worshiping the Lord .
ERV	Joshua	22	26	“ So we decided to build this altar . But we did not plan to use it for burning offerings and sacrifices .
ERV	Joshua	22	27	The real reason we wanted our altar was to show our people that we worship the same God you do . This altar will be the proof to you and us and to all our future children that we worship the Lord . We give our sacrifices , grain offerings , and fellowship offerings to the Lord . We wanted your children to grow up and know that we are also Israelites like yourselves .
ERV	Joshua	22	28	In the future , if it happens that your children say that we don ’ t belong to Israel , then our children can say , ‘ Look , our fathers who lived before us made an altar . That altar is exactly like the Lord ’ s altar at the Holy Tent . We don ’ t use this altar for sacrifices—this altar is proof that we are part of Israel. ’
ERV	Joshua	22	29	“ The truth is , we don ’ t want to be against the Lord . We don ’ t want to stop following him now . We know that the only true altar is the one that is in front of the Holy Tent . That altar belongs to the Lord our God. ”
ERV	Joshua	22	30	Phinehas the priest and the leaders with him heard what the people from Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh said . They were satisfied that they were telling the truth .
ERV	Joshua	22	31	So Phinehas the priest said , “ Now we know that the Lord is with us and that you did not turn against him . We are happy that the Israelites will not be punished by the Lord. ”
ERV	Joshua	22	32	Then Phinehas and the leaders left that place and went home . They left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and went back to Canaan . They went back to the Israelites and told them what had happened .
ERV	Joshua	22	33	The Israelites were also satisfied . They were happy and thanked God . They decided not to go and fight against the people of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh . They decided not to destroy the land where those people live .
ERV	Joshua	22	34	The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar “ Proof That We Believe the Lord is God. ” Footnotes - Joshua 22:22 The Lord is our God Or “ Yahweh is the true God ! ” Literally , “ El Elohim Yahweh ! ”
ERV	Joshua	23	23	The Lord gave Israel peace from their enemies around them . He made Israel safe . Many years passed , and Joshua became very old .
ERV	Joshua	23	2	At this time Joshua called a meeting of all the older leaders , heads of families , judges , and officers of the Israelites . Joshua said , “ I have grown very old .
ERV	Joshua	23	3	You have seen what the Lord did to our enemies . He did this to help us . The Lord your God fought for you .
ERV	Joshua	23	4	Remember that I told you that your people could have the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea in the west . I promised to give you that land , but you don ’ t control it yet . I have taken the land away from those nations , but they are still living there .
ERV	Joshua	23	5	But the Lord your God will force the people living there to leave . You will take that land . The Lord will force them to leave , just as he promised .
ERV	Joshua	23	6	“ You must be careful to obey every command written in the Book of the Law [ a ] of Moses . Never turn away from that law .
ERV	Joshua	23	7	There are still some people living among us who are not Israelites . They worship their own gods . Don ’ t become friends with them . Don ’ t serve or worship their gods .
ERV	Joshua	23	8	You must continue to follow the Lord your God . You have done this in the past , and you must continue to do it .
ERV	Joshua	23	9	“ The Lord helped you defeat many great and powerful nations . He forced them to leave . No nation has been able to defeat you .
ERV	Joshua	23	10	With his help , one man from Israel could defeat
ERV	Joshua	23	1000	enemy soldiers , because the Lord your God fights for you , as he promised .
ERV	Joshua	23	11	So you must continue to love the Lord your God .
ERV	Joshua	23	12	“ Never stop following him . Don ’ t become friends with those people who did not leave when you took the land . They are not part of Israel . Don ’ t marry any of their people . If you become friends with those people ,
ERV	Joshua	23	13	the Lord your God will not help you defeat your enemies . They will become like a trap for you . They will cause you pain—like smoke and dust in your eyes . And you will be forced to leave this good land . The Lord your God gave you this land . But you can lose it if you don ’ t obey this command .
ERV	Joshua	23	14	“ It is almost time for me to die . You know and really believe that the Lord has done many great things for you . You know that the Lord your God has not failed in any of his promises . He has kept every promise that he has made to us .
ERV	Joshua	23	15	Every good promise that the Lord your God made to us has come true . But in the same way , the Lord will make his other promises come true : If you do wrong , bad things will happen to you . You will be forced to leave this good land that the Lord your God has given to you .
ERV	Joshua	23	16	This will happen if you refuse to keep your agreement with the Lord your God . You will lose this land if you go and serve other gods . You must not worship those other gods . If you do , the Lord will become very angry with you . Then you will quickly be forced to leave this good land that he gave you. ” Footnotes - Joshua 23:6 Law Or “ Teachings . ”
ERV	Joshua	24	24	Then the people said to Joshua , “ We will serve the Lord our God . We will obey him. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	2	Then Joshua spoke to all the people . He said , “ I am telling you what the Lord , the God of Israel , says to you : ‘ A long time ago , your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River . I am talking about men like Terah , the father of Abraham and Nahor . At that time they worshiped other gods .
ERV	Joshua	24	3	But I took your father Abraham out of the land on the other side of the River . I led him through the land of Canaan and gave him many children . I gave Abraham his son Isaac .
ERV	Joshua	24	4	And I gave Isaac two sons , Jacob and Esau . To Esau , I gave the land around the mountains of Seir . Jacob and his sons did not live there . They went to live in the land of Egypt .
ERV	Joshua	24	5	“ ‘ Then I sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt . I wanted them to bring my people out of Egypt . I caused many terrible things to happen to the people of Egypt . Then I brought your people out of Egypt .
ERV	Joshua	24	6	When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt , they came to the Red Sea , and the men of Egypt were chasing them . There were chariots and men on horses .
ERV	Joshua	24	7	So the people asked me , the Lord , for help . And I caused great trouble to come to the men of Egypt . I caused the sea to cover them . You yourselves saw what I did to the army of Egypt . “ ‘ After that you lived in the desert for a long time .
ERV	Joshua	24	8	Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites , east of the Jordan River . Those people fought against you , but I allowed you to defeat them . I gave you the power to destroy them , and you took control of that land .
ERV	Joshua	24	9	“ ‘ Then Balak , the son of Zippor , the king of Moab , prepared to fight against the Israelites . The king sent for Balaam the son of Beor to curse you ,
ERV	Joshua	24	10	but I refused to listen to Balaam ’ s prayer . So he asked me to bless you , and I saved you from the enemy .
ERV	Joshua	24	11	“ ‘ Then you went across the Jordan River to the city of Jericho . The people in Jericho fought against you . Also , the Amorites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hittites , Girgashites , Hivites , and Jebusites fought against you . But I allowed you to defeat them all .
ERV	Joshua	24	12	As your army went forward , I sent the Hornet [ a ] ahead of them and made the people leave the land , as I did to the two Amorite kings . [ b ] It was not your swords and bows that brought you victory !
ERV	Joshua	24	13	“ ‘ I , the Lord , gave that land to you . You didn ’ t work for that land—I gave it to you . You did not build those cities—I gave them to you . And now you live in that land and in those cities . You have vineyards and olive trees , but you did not have to plant those gardens. ’ ”
ERV	Joshua	24	14	Then Joshua said to the people , “ Now you have heard the Lord ’ s words . So you must respect the Lord and sincerely serve him . Throw away the false gods that your ancestors worshiped . That was something that happened a long time ago on the other side of the Euphrates River and in Egypt . Now you must serve only the Lord .
ERV	Joshua	24	15	“ But maybe you don ’ t want to serve the Lord . You must choose for yourselves today . Today you must decide who you will serve . Will you serve the gods that your ancestors worshiped when they lived on the other side of the Euphrates River ? Or will you serve the gods of the Amorites who lived in this land ? You must choose for yourselves . But as for me and my family , we will serve the Lord. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	16	Then the people answered , “ We will never stop following the Lord . We will never serve other gods !
ERV	Joshua	24	17	We know that it was the Lord God who brought our people out of Egypt . We were slaves in that land , but he did great things for us there . He brought us out of that land and protected us while we traveled through other lands .
ERV	Joshua	24	18	The Lord helped us defeat the people living in these lands . He helped us defeat the Amorites who lived in this land where we are now . So we will continue to serve the Lord , because he is our God. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	19	Then Joshua said , “ You will not be able to continue serving the Lord . God is holy . And God hates his people worshiping other gods . He will not forgive you if you turn against him like that .
ERV	Joshua	24	20	If you leave the Lord and serve other gods , he will cause terrible things to happen to you . He will destroy you . He has been good to you , but if you turn against him he will destroy you. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	21	Then the people said to Joshua , “ No , we will serve the Lord ! ”
ERV	Joshua	24	22	Then Joshua said , “ Look around at yourselves and the people with you . Do you all know and agree that you have chosen to serve the Lord ? Are you all witnesses to this ? ” The people answered , “ Yes , it is true . We all see that we have chosen to serve the Lord. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	23	Then Joshua said , “ So throw away the false gods that you have among you . Love the Lord , the God of Israel , with all your heart. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	25	So that day Joshua made an agreement for the people . He made this agreement at the town called Shechem . It became a law for them to follow .
ERV	Joshua	24	26	Joshua wrote these things in the Book of the Law of God . Then he found a large stone to be the proof of this agreement . He put the stone under the oak tree near the Lord ’ s Holy Tent .
ERV	Joshua	24	27	Then Joshua said to all the people , “ This stone will help you remember what we said today . This stone was here when the Lord was speaking to us today . So this stone will be something that helps you remember what happened today . The stone will be a witness against you . It will stop you from turning against your God. ”
ERV	Joshua	24	28	Then Joshua told the people to go home . So everyone went back to his own land . Joshua Dies

ERV	Judges	1	3	The men of Judah went to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon and asked for help . They said , “ Brothers , if you will come and help us fight for the land God gave us , we will go and help you fight for your land. ” The men of Simeon agreed and went with them .

ERV	Judges	2	21	So I will no longer defeat the nations and clear the way for the Israelites . Those nations were still in this land when Joshua died , and I will let them stay in this land .
ERV	Judges	2	22	I will use them to test the Israelites . I will see if the Israelites can keep the Lord ’ s commands as their ancestors did. ”

ERV	Judges	4	4	There was a woman prophet named Deborah . She was the wife of a man named Lappidoth . She was judge of Israel at that time .
ERV	Judges	4	2	So the Lord allowed King Jabin of Canaan to defeat the Israelites . Jabin ruled in a city named Hazor . A man named Sisera was the commander of King Jabin ’ s army . Sisera lived in a town called Harosheth Haggoyim .
ERV	Judges	4	3	Sisera had
ERV	Judges	4	900	iron chariots and all the men with him , and they marched from the city of Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River .
ERV	Judges	4	20	Then Sisera said to Jael , “ Go stand at the entrance to the tent . If anyone comes by and asks you , ‘ Is anyone in there ? ’ say , ‘ No. ’ ”
ERV	Judges	4	5	One day Deborah was sitting under the Palm Tree of Deborah , and the Israelites came up to her to ask what to do about Sisera . ( The Palm Tree of Deborah is between the cities of Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim . )
ERV	Judges	4	6	Deborah sent a message to a man named Barak and asked him to come meet with her . Barak was the son of a man named Abinoam . Barak lived in the city of Kedesh , which is in the area of Naphtali . Deborah said to Barak , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , commands you : ‘ Go and gather 10,000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun . Lead them to Mount Tabor .
ERV	Judges	4	7	I will make Sisera , the commander of King Jabin ’ s army , come to you . I will make Sisera , his chariots , and his army come to the Kishon River . [ a ] I will help you defeat Sisera there. ’ ”
ERV	Judges	4	8	Then Barak said to Deborah , “ I will go and do this if you will go with me . But if you will not go with me , I will not go. ”
ERV	Judges	4	9	“ Of course I will go with you , ” Deborah answered . “ But because of your attitude , you will not be honored when Sisera is defeated . The Lord will allow a woman to defeat Sisera. ” So Deborah went with Barak to the city of Kedesh .
ERV	Judges	4	10	At the city of Kedesh , Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali together . He gathered 10,000 men to follow him from these tribes , and Deborah also went with him .
ERV	Judges	4	11	There was a man named Heber who was from the Kenites . The Kenites were descendants of Moses ’ father-in-law , [ b ] Hobab . Heber had left the other Kenites and had made his home by the oak tree in Zaanannim , near the city of Kedesh .
ERV	Judges	4	12	Someone told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam was at Mount Tabor .
ERV	Judges	4	13	So Sisera gathered his
ERV	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , “ Today the Lord will help you defeat Sisera . Surely you know that the Lord has already cleared the way for you. ” So Barak led the 10,000 men down from Mount Tabor .
ERV	Judges	4	15	Barak and his men attacked Sisera . During the battle , the Lord confused Sisera and his army and chariots . They did not know what to do . Barak and his men defeated Sisera ’ s army , but Sisera left his chariot and ran away on foot .
ERV	Judges	4	16	Barak continued fighting Sisera ’ s army . He and his men chased Sisera ’ s chariots and army all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim . They used their swords to kill all of Sisera ’ s men . Not one of Sisera ’ s men was left alive .
ERV	Judges	4	17	But Sisera ran away to the tent where a woman named Jael lived . Jael was the wife of Heber the Kenite . His family was at peace with King Jabin of Hazor . That is why Sisera ran to Jael ’ s tent .
ERV	Judges	4	18	Jael saw him coming , so she went out to meet him and said , “ Sir , come into my tent . Come in . Don ’ t be afraid. ” So Sisera went into Jael ’ s tent , and she covered him with a blanket .
ERV	Judges	4	19	But first , Sisera asked Jael for a drink of water . Jael had some milk in a bottle made from animal skin . So she gave him a drink of the milk and then covered him up .
ERV	Judges	4	21	But Jael found a tent peg and a hammer . She quietly went to Sisera . Sisera was very tired , so he was sleeping . She put the tent peg to the side of Sisera ’ s head and hit it with a hammer . The tent peg went through the side of his head and into the ground . Sisera died .
ERV	Judges	4	22	Just then Barak came by Jael ’ s tent , looking for Sisera . Jael went out to meet Barak and said , “ Come in here , and I will show you the man you are looking for. ” So Barak entered the tent with Jael . There Barak found Sisera lying dead on the ground , with the tent peg through the side of his head .
ERV	Judges	4	23	On that day God defeated King Jabin of Canaan for the Israelites .
ERV	Judges	4	24	So the Israelites became stronger and stronger until they defeated King Jabin of Canaan . The Israelites finally destroyed him . Footnotes - Judges 4:7 Kishon River A river about ten miles from Mount Tabor . - Judges 4:11 father-in-law Or possibly , “ son-in-law . ”

ERV	Judges	6	6	The Israelites became very poor because of the Midianites . So the Israelites cried to the Lord for help .
ERV	Judges	6	2	The Midianites were very powerful and were cruel to the Israelites . So the Israelites made many hiding places in the mountains . They hid their food in caves and places that were hard to find .
ERV	Judges	6	3	They did that because the Midianites and Amalekites from the east always came and destroyed their crops .
ERV	Judges	6	4	They camped in the land and destroyed the crops that the Israelites had planted . They ruined the crops of the Israelites as far as the land near the city of Gaza . They did not leave anything for the Israelites to eat . They did not even leave them any sheep , cattle , or donkeys .
ERV	Judges	6	5	The Midianites came with their families , animals , and tents . They were like a swarm of locusts ! They and their camels were too many to count . They came into the land and ruined it .
ERV	Judges	6	7	[ a ] The Midianites did all these bad things , so the Israelites cried to the Lord for help .
ERV	Judges	6	8	The Lord sent a prophet to them . He said , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You were slaves in the land of Egypt . I made you free and brought you out of that land .
ERV	Judges	6	9	I saved you from the powerful Egyptians . Then the Canaanites hurt you , so I saved you again . I made them leave their land . And I gave their land to you. ’
ERV	Judges	6	10	Then I said to you , ‘ I am the Lord your God . You will live in the land of the Amorites , but you must not worship their false gods. ’ But you did not obey me. ” The Angel of the Lord Visits Gideon 11-12 One time the angel of the Lord came to a place called Ophrah and sat under an oak tree . This oak tree belonged to a man named Joash from the Abiezer family . His son Gideon was beating some wheat [ b ] in a winepress . He was hiding so that the Midianites could not see the wheat . The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon and said , “ The Lord be with you , brave soldier. ”
ERV	Judges	6	13	Then Gideon said , “ Pardon me , sir , but if the Lord is with us , why are we having so many troubles ? We heard that he did wonderful things for our ancestors . They tell us that the Lord took them out of Egypt . But now it seems the Lord has left us and is letting the Midianites defeat us. ”
ERV	Judges	6	14	The Lord turned toward Gideon and said , “ Then use your great power and go save the Israelites from the Midianites . I am sending you to save them. ”
ERV	Judges	6	15	But Gideon answered and said , “ Pardon me , sir . [ c ] How can I save Israel ? My family group is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh , and I am the youngest one in my family. ”
ERV	Judges	6	16	The Lord answered Gideon and said , “ I will be with you , so you can defeat the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man. ”
ERV	Judges	6	17	Then Gideon said to him , “ If you would , please give me some proof that you really are the Lord .
ERV	Judges	6	18	Please wait here . Don ’ t go away until I come back to you . Let me bring my offering and set it down in front of you. ” And the Lord said , “ I will wait until you come back. ”

The standard Hebrew text has “ Take the bull of the bull [ s ] , the second bull , the seven-year-old one. ” Adding different vowels to the Hebrew text gives a meaning similar to that in the translation above . - Judges 6:32 Jerub-Baal This is like the Hebrew words meaning “ Let Baal argue. ” The same verb is translated “ take one ’ s side ” and “ defend ” in verse
ERV	Judges	6	23	But the Lord said to Gideon , “ Calm down ! [ e ] Don ’ t be afraid ! You will not die ! ” [ f ]
ERV	Judges	6	24	So Gideon built an altar there to worship the Lord and named it “ The Lord is Peace. ” It still stands in the city of Ophrah , where the Abiezer family lives . Gideon Tears Down the Altar of Baal
ERV	Judges	6	25	That same night the Lord said to Gideon , “ Choose your father ’ s best bull , the one that is seven years old . [ g ] First , use it to pull down the altar your father built to worship Baal . Also , cut down the Asherah pole beside the altar .
ERV	Judges	6	26	Then build the right kind of altar for the Lord your God . Build it on this high ground . Then kill and burn the bull on this altar . Use the wood from the Asherah pole to burn your offering. ”
ERV	Judges	6	27	So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the Lord had told him to do . But Gideon was afraid that his family and the men of the city might see what he was doing , so he did it all at night , not in the daytime .
ERV	Judges	6	28	The men of the city got up the next morning and saw that the altar for Baal had been destroyed ! They also saw that the Asherah pole had been cut down . It had been sitting next to the altar for Baal . They also saw the altar that Gideon had built . And they saw the bull that had been sacrificed on that altar .
ERV	Judges	6	29	The men of the city looked at each other and asked , “ Who pulled down our altar ? Who cut down our Asherah pole ? Who sacrificed this bull on this new altar ? ” They asked many questions and tried to learn who did this . Someone told them , “ Gideon son of Joash did this. ”
ERV	Judges	6	30	So the men of the city came to Joash and said , “ You must bring your son out . He pulled down the altar for Baal , and he cut down the Asherah pole that was beside it . So your son must die. ”
ERV	Judges	6	31	.
ERV	Judges	6	32	Joash said , “ If Gideon pulled Baal ’ s altar down , let Baal argue with him. ” On that day Joash gave Gideon a new name . He called him Jerub-Baal . [ h ] Gideon Defeats the Midianites
ERV	Judges	6	33	The Midianites , Amalekites , and other people from the east joined together to fight against the Israelites . They went across the Jordan River and camped in the Jezreel Valley .
ERV	Judges	6	34	The Spirit of the Lord filled Gideon . So Gideon blew a trumpet to call the family of Abiezer to follow him .
ERV	Judges	6	35	He sent messengers to all the people of the tribe of Manasseh and told them to get their weapons and prepare for battle . Gideon also sent messengers to the tribes of Asher , Zebulun , and Naphtali . The messengers took the same message to them . So they also went up to meet Gideon and his men .
ERV	Judges	6	36	Then Gideon said to God , “ You said that you would help me save the Israelites . Give me proof .
ERV	Judges	6	37	I will put a sheepskin on the threshing floor . If there is dew only on the sheepskin , while all the ground is dry , I will know that you will use me to save Israel , as you said. ”
ERV	Judges	6	38	And that is exactly what happened . Gideon got up early the next morning and squeezed the sheepskin . He was able to drain a bowl full of water from it .
ERV	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , “ Don ’ t be angry with me . Let me ask just one more thing . Let me test you one more time with the sheepskin . This time let the sheepskin be dry , while the ground around it gets wet with dew. ”
ERV	Judges	6	40	That night God did that very thing . Just the sheepskin was dry , but the ground around it was wet with dew .

ERV	Judges	7	2	Then the Lord said to Gideon , “ I am going to help your men defeat the Midianites , but you have too many men . I don ’ t want the Israelites to forget me and brag that they saved themselves .
ERV	Judges	7	3	So make an announcement to your men . Tell them , ‘ Anyone who is afraid may leave Mount Gilead and go back home. ’ ” At that time 22,000 men left Gideon and went back home , but 10,000 still remained .
ERV	Judges	7	4	Then the Lord said to Gideon , “ There are still too many men . Take the men down to the water , and I will test them for you there . If I say , ‘ This man will go with you , ’ he will go . But if I say , ‘ That one will not go with you , ’ then he will not go. ”
ERV	Judges	7	5	So Gideon led the men down to the water . There the Lord said to him , “ Separate the men like this : Those who drink the water by using their tongue to lap it up like a dog will be in one group . And those who bend down to drink will be in the other group. ”
ERV	Judges	7	6	There were
ERV	Judges	7	300	men blew their trumpets , the Lord caused the men of Midian to kill each other with their swords . The enemy army ran away to the city of Beth Shittah , which is toward the city of Zererah . They ran as far as the border of the city of Abel Meholah , which is near the city of Tabbath .
ERV	Judges	7	8	So Gideon sent the other men of Israel home . He kept the
ERV	Judges	7	9	During the night the Lord spoke to Gideon and said , “ Get up . I will let you defeat the Midianite army . Go down to their camp .
ERV	Judges	7	10	If you are afraid to go alone , take your servant Purah with you . Go into the camp of the Midianites .
ERV	Judges	7	11	Listen to what they are saying . After that you will not be afraid to attack them. ” So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp .
ERV	Judges	7	12	The Midianites , the Amalekites , and all the other people from the east were camped in that valley . There were so many people that they seemed like a swarm of locusts . It seemed like they had as many camels as there are grains of sand on the seashore .
ERV	Judges	7	13	Gideon came to the enemy camp , and he heard a man talking . That man was telling his friend about a dream that he had . He was saying , “ I dreamed that a round loaf of bread came rolling into the camp of the Midianites . That loaf of bread hit the tent so hard that the tent turned over and fell flat. ”
ERV	Judges	7	14	The man ’ s friend knew the meaning of the dream . He said , “ Your dream can only have one meaning . Your dream is about that man from Israel . It is about Gideon son of Joash . It means that God will let Gideon defeat the whole army of Midian. ”
ERV	Judges	7	15	After he heard the men talking about the dream and what it meant , Gideon bowed down to God . Then Gideon went back to the camp of the Israelites and called out to the people , “ Get up ! The Lord will help us defeat the Midianites. ”
ERV	Judges	7	16	Then Gideon divided the
ERV	Judges	7	17	Then Gideon told the men , “ Watch me and do what I do . Follow me to the edge of the enemy camp . When I get to the edge of the camp , do exactly what I do .
ERV	Judges	7	18	You men surround the enemy camp . I and all the men with me will blow our trumpets . When we blow our trumpets , you blow your trumpets too . Then shout these words : ‘ For the Lord and for Gideon ! ’ ”
ERV	Judges	7	19	So Gideon and the
ERV	Judges	7	100	men with him went to the edge of the enemy camp . They came there just after the enemy changed guards . It was during the middle watch of the night . Gideon and his men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars .
ERV	Judges	7	20	Then all three groups of Gideon ’ s men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars . The men held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands . As they blew their trumpets , they shouted , “ A sword for the Lord and a sword for Gideon ! ”
ERV	Judges	7	21	Gideon ’ s men stayed where they were . But inside the camp , the men of Midian began shouting and running away .
ERV	Judges	7	22	When Gideon ’ s
ERV	Judges	7	23	Then soldiers from the tribes of Naphtali , Asher , and all of Manasseh were told to chase the Midianites .
ERV	Judges	7	24	Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim . The messengers said , “ Come down and attack the Midianites . Take control of the river as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan River . Do this before the Midianites get there. ” So they called all men from the tribe of Ephraim . They took control of the river as far as Beth Barah .
ERV	Judges	7	25	The men of Ephraim caught two of the Midianite leaders named Oreb and Zeeb . They killed Oreb at a place named the Rock of Oreb and Zeeb at a place named the Winepress of Zeeb . They continued chasing the Midianites , but first they cut off the heads of Oreb and Zeeb and took the heads to Gideon . Gideon was at the place where people cross the Jordan River .
ERV	Judges	8	8	Gideon left the city of Succoth and went to the city of Penuel . He asked the men of Penuel for food , just as he had asked the men of Succoth . But the men of Penuel gave Gideon the same answer that the men of Succoth had given .
ERV	Judges	8	2	But Gideon answered the men of Ephraim , “ I have not done as well as you . You people of Ephraim have a much better harvest than my family , the Abiezers . At harvest time you leave more grapes in the vineyard than my family gathers ! Isn ’ t that true ?
ERV	Judges	8	3	In the same way you have a better harvest now . God allowed you to capture Oreb and Zeeb , the leaders of Midian . How can I compare my success with what you did ? ” When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon ’ s answer , they were not as angry as they had been . Gideon Captures Two Kings of Midian
ERV	Judges	8	4	Then Gideon and his
ERV	Judges	8	300	men came to the Jordan River and went across to the other side , but they were tired and hungry . [ a ]
ERV	Judges	8	5	Gideon said to the men of the city of Succoth , “ Give my soldiers something to eat . They are very tired . We are still chasing Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian. ”
ERV	Judges	8	6	But the leaders of the city of Succoth said to Gideon , “ Why should we give your soldiers something to eat ? You haven ’ t caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet. ”
ERV	Judges	8	7	Then Gideon said , “ The Lord will help me capture Zebah and Zalmunna . And since you would not give us any food , I will come back and beat you with thorns and briers from the desert. ”
ERV	Judges	8	9	So Gideon said to the men of Penuel , “ After I win the victory , I will come back here and pull this tower down. ”
ERV	Judges	8	10	Zebah and Zalmunna and their army were in the city of Karkor . Their army had 15,000 soldiers in it . These soldiers were all who were left of the army of the people of the east . 120,000 strong soldiers of that army had already been killed .
ERV	Judges	8	11	Gideon and his men used Tent Dwellers ’ Road , which is east of the cities of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the enemy at Karkor . The enemy army did not expect the attack .
ERV	Judges	8	12	Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of the Midianites , ran away . But Gideon chased and caught them . Gideon and his men defeated the enemy army .
ERV	Judges	8	13	Then Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle . He and his men returned by going through a mountain pass called the Pass of Heres .
ERV	Judges	8	14	Gideon captured a young man from the city of Succoth . He asked the young man some questions . The young man wrote down some names for Gideon . The young man wrote down the names of the leaders and elders of the city of Succoth . He gave Gideon the names of
ERV	Judges	8	77	men .
ERV	Judges	8	15	When Gideon came to the city of Succoth , he said to the men of that city , “ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna . You made fun of me by saying , ‘ Why should we give food to your tired soldiers ? You have not caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet. ’ ”
ERV	Judges	8	16	Gideon took the elders of the city of Succoth and beat them with thorns and briers from the desert .
ERV	Judges	8	17	Gideon also pulled down the tower in the city of Penuel and killed the men living in that city .
ERV	Judges	8	18	Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna , “ You killed some men on Mount Tabor . What were the men like ? ” Zebah and Zalmunna answered , “ They were like you . Each one of them seemed like a prince. ”
ERV	Judges	8	19	Gideon said , “ Those men were my brothers , my mother ’ s sons ! As the Lord lives , if you had not killed them , I would not kill you now. ”
ERV	Judges	8	20	Then Gideon turned to Jether , his oldest son , and said , “ Kill these kings. ” But Jether was only a boy and was afraid , so he would not take out his sword .

Don ’ t eat any food that is unclean , because the boy will be dedicated to God in a special way . The boy will be God ’ s special person from before he is born until the day he dies. ’ ”
ERV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord . He said , “ Lord , I beg you to send the man of God to us again . We want him to teach us what we should do for the boy who will soon be born. ”
ERV	Judges	13	9	God heard Manoah ’ s prayer . The angel of God came to the woman again . She was sitting in a field and her husband Manoah was not with her .
ERV	Judges	13	10	So the woman ran to tell her husband , “ The man is back ! The man who came to me the other day is here. ”
ERV	Judges	13	11	Manoah got up and followed his wife . When he came to the man , he said , “ Are you the same man who spoke to my wife before ? ” The angel said , “ I am. ”
ERV	Judges	13	12	So Manoah said , “ May what you say happen . Tell me , what kind of life will the boy live ? What will he do ? ”
ERV	Judges	13	14	She must not eat anything that grows on a grapevine . She must not drink any wine or strong drink . She must not eat any food that is unclean . She must do everything that I have commanded her to do. ”
ERV	Judges	13	15	Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ We would like for you to stay a while . We want to cook a young goat for you to eat. ”
ERV	Judges	13	16	The angel of the Lord said to Manoah , “ Even if you keep me from leaving , I will not eat your food . But if you want to prepare something , offer a burnt offering to the Lord. ” ( Manoah did not understand that the man was really the angel of the Lord . )
ERV	Judges	13	17	Then Manoah asked the angel of the Lord , “ What is your name ? We want to know so that we can honor you when what you have said really happens. ”
ERV	Judges	13	18	The angel of the Lord said , “ Why do you ask my name ? It is too amazing for you to believe . [ a ] ”
ERV	Judges	13	19	Then Manoah sacrificed a young goat on a rock . He offered the goat and a grain offering as a gift to the Lord and to the One Who Does Amazing Things . [ b ]
ERV	Judges	13	20	Manoah and his wife were watching what happened . As the flames went up to the sky from the altar , the angel of the Lord went up to heaven in the fire . When Manoah and his wife saw that , they bowed down with their faces to the ground .
ERV	Judges	13	21	He finally understood that the man was really the angel of the Lord . The angel of the Lord did not appear to Manoah and his wife again .
ERV	Judges	13	22	Manoah said to his wife , “ We have seen God . Surely we will die because of this. ”
ERV	Judges	13	23	But his wife said to him , “ The Lord does not want to kill us . If he wanted to kill us , he would not have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering . He would not have shown us all these things or told us this. ”
ERV	Judges	13	24	So the woman had a boy . She named him Samson . He grew and the Lord blessed him .
ERV	Judges	13	25	The Spirit of the Lord began to work in Samson while he was in the city of Mahaneh Dan . That city is between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol . Footnotes - Judges 13:18 It is … believe Or “ It is Pelei. ” This means “ amazing ” or “ wonderful. ” This is like the name “ Wonderful Counselor ” in Isa . 9:6 . - Judges 13:19 the Lord … Amazing Things Or “ the Lord Who Does Amazing Things. ” Both of these are names for God , but Manoah didn ’ t know the man was really the angel of the Lord .
ERV	Judges	14	14	Samson told them this riddle : “ Out of the eater came something to eat . Out of the strong came something sweet. ” The
ERV	Judges	14	2	When he returned home , he said to his father and mother , “ I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah . I want you to get her for me . I want to marry her. ”
ERV	Judges	14	3	His father and his mother answered , “ But surely there is a woman from the Israelites you can marry . Do you have to marry a woman from the Philistines ? Their men are not even circumcised. ” But Samson said , “ Get that woman for me ! She is the one I want ! ”
ERV	Judges	14	4	( Samson ’ s parents did not know that the Lord wanted this to happen . He was looking for a way to do something against the Philistines . They were ruling over the Israelites at that time . )
ERV	Judges	14	5	Samson went down with his father and mother to the city of Timnah . They went as far as the vineyards near that city . There a young lion suddenly roared and jumped at Samson !
ERV	Judges	14	6	The Spirit of the Lord came on Samson with great power . He tore the lion apart with his bare hands . It seemed easy to him . It was as easy as tearing apart a young goat . But Samson did not tell his father or mother what he had done .
ERV	Judges	14	7	So Samson went down to the city and talked to the Philistine woman . She pleased him .
ERV	Judges	14	8	Several days later , Samson came back to marry her . On his way , he went over to look at the dead lion . He found a swarm of bees in its body . They had made some honey .
ERV	Judges	14	9	Samson got some of the honey with his hands . He walked along eating the honey . When he came to his parents , he gave them some of the honey , and they ate it too . But Samson did not tell his parents that he had taken the honey from the body of the dead lion .
ERV	Judges	14	10	Samson ’ s father went down to see the Philistine woman . The custom was for the bridegroom to give a party . So Samson gave a party .
ERV	Judges	14	11	When the Philistines saw that he was having a party , they sent
ERV	Judges	14	30	Philistine men . He took all the clothes and property from the dead bodies and gave them to the men who had answered his riddle . Then he went to his father ’ s house .
ERV	Judges	14	12	Then Samson said to the
ERV	Judges	14	13	But if you can not find the answer , you must give me
ERV	Judges	14	15	On the fourth day , [ a ] the men came to Samson ’ s wife . They said , “ Did you invite us here just to make us poor ? You must trick your husband into telling us the answer to the riddle . If you don ’ t get the answer for us , we will burn you and everyone in your father ’ s house to death. ”
ERV	Judges	14	16	So Samson ’ s wife went to him and began crying . She said , “ You just hate me ! You don ’ t really love me ! You told my people a riddle , and you will not tell me the answer. ” Samson said to her , “ Look , I have not even told my father and mother . So why should I tell you ? ”
ERV	Judges	14	17	Samson ’ s wife cried for the rest of the seven days of the party . So he finally gave her the answer to the riddle on the seventh day . He told her because she kept bothering him . Then she went to her people and told them the answer to the riddle .
ERV	Judges	14	18	So before the sun went down on the seventh day of the party , the Philistine men had the answer . They came to Samson and said , “ What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? ” Then Samson said to them , “ If you had not plowed with my cow , you would not have solved my riddle ! ”
ERV	Judges	14	19	Samson was very angry . The Spirit of the Lord came on Samson with great power . He went down to the city of Ashkelon and killed
ERV	Judges	14	20	So Samson ’ s wife was given to his best man . Footnotes - Judges 14:15 fourth day This is from the ancient Greek version . The standard Hebrew text has “ seventh day . ”
ERV	Judges	15	15	Samson found a jawbone of a dead donkey and killed
ERV	Judges	15	2	He said , “ I thought you hated her , so I let her marry the best man at the wedding . Her younger sister is more beautiful . Take her younger sister. ”
ERV	Judges	15	3	But Samson said to him , “ Now I have a good reason to hurt you Philistines . No one will blame me now. ”
ERV	Judges	15	4	So Samson went out and caught
ERV	Judges	15	300	foxes . He took two foxes at a time and tied their tails together to make pairs . Then he tied a torch between the tails of each pair of foxes .
ERV	Judges	15	5	He lit the torches that were between the foxes ’ tails and let them run through the grain fields of the Philistines . In this way he burned up the plants growing in their fields and the stacks of grain they had cut . He also burned up their vineyards and their olive trees .
ERV	Judges	15	6	The Philistines asked , “ Who did this ? ” Someone told them , “ Samson , the son-in-law of the man from Timnah , did this . He did this because his father-in-law gave Samson ’ s wife to the best man at his wedding. ” So the Philistines burned Samson ’ s wife and her father to death .
ERV	Judges	15	7	Then Samson said to the Philistines , “ You did this bad thing to me , so now I will do bad things to you . Then I will be finished with you ! ”
ERV	Judges	15	8	Samson attacked the Philistines and killed many of them . Then he went and stayed in a cave in a place named the Rock of Etam .
ERV	Judges	15	9	The Philistines went to the land of Judah and stopped near a place named Lehi . Their army camped there .
ERV	Judges	15	10	The men of the tribe of Judah asked them , “ Why have you Philistines come here to fight us ? ” They answered , “ We have come to get Samson . We want to make him our prisoner . We want to punish him for what he has done to our people. ”
ERV	Judges	15	11	Then
ERV	Judges	15	3000	men from the tribe of Judah went to the cave near the Rock of Etam and said to Samson , “ What have you done to us ? Don ’ t you know that the Philistines rule over us ? ” Samson answered , “ I only punished them for what they did to me. ”
ERV	Judges	15	12	Then they said to Samson , “ We have come to tie you up . We will give you to the Philistines. ” Samson said to the men from Judah , “ Promise me that you yourselves will not hurt me. ”
ERV	Judges	15	13	The men from Judah said , “ We agree . We will just tie you up and give you to the Philistines . We promise that we will not kill you. ” So they tied Samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock .
ERV	Judges	15	14	When Samson came to the place called Lehi , the Philistines came to meet him . They were shouting with joy . Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Samson with great power . Samson broke the ropes—they were like burned strings falling from his arms and the ropes on his hands seemed to melt away .
ERV	Judges	15	1000	men ! With a donkey ’ s jawbone , I piled [ a ] them into a tall pile. ”
ERV	Judges	15	16	Then Samson said , “ With a donkey ’ s jawbone , I killed
ERV	Judges	15	17	When Samson finished speaking , he threw the jawbone down . So that place was named Ramath Lehi . [ b ]
ERV	Judges	15	18	Samson was very thirsty . So he cried to the Lord . He said , “ I am your servant . You gave me this great victory . Please don ’ t let me die from thirst now . Please don ’ t let me be captured by men who are not even circumcised. ”
ERV	Judges	15	19	There is a hole in the ground at Lehi . God made that hole crack open , and water came out . Samson drank the water and felt better . He felt strong again . So he named that water spring En Hakkore . [ c ] It is still there in the city of Lehi today .
ERV	Judges	15	20	years during the time of the Philistines . Footnotes - Judges 15:16 piled In Hebrew , the word “ pile ” is like the word “ donkey. ” - Judges 15:17 Ramath Lehi This name means “ Jawbone Heights. ” - Judges 15:19 En Hakkore This name means “ The spring of the one who calls . ”
ERV	Judges	16	16	She kept bothering Samson day after day . He got so tired of her asking him about his secret that he felt like he was going to die .
ERV	Judges	16	2	Someone told the people of Gaza , “ Samson has come here. ” They wanted to kill him , so they surrounded the city . They hid near the city gate and waited all night for him . They were very quiet all night long . They had said to each other , “ When morning comes , we will kill Samson. ”
ERV	Judges	16	3	But Samson only stayed with the prostitute until midnight . Then he got up and grabbed the doors of the city gate and pulled them loose from the wall . He pulled down the doors , the two posts , and the bars that lock the doors shut . He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill near the city of Hebron . Samson and Delilah
ERV	Judges	16	4	Later , Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah , who was from Sorek Valley .
ERV	Judges	16	5	The rulers of the Philistines went to Delilah and said , “ We want to know what makes Samson so strong . Try to trick him into telling you his secret . Then we will know how to capture him and tie him up . Then we will be able to control him . If you do this , each one of us will give you
ERV	Judges	16	28	pounds Literally , “
ERV	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , “ Tell me why you are so strong . How could someone tie you up and make you helpless ? ”
ERV	Judges	16	7	Samson answered , “ Someone would have to tie me up with seven fresh , new bowstrings . [ b ] If someone did that , I would be as weak as any other man. ”
ERV	Judges	16	8	Then the rulers of the Philistines brought seven fresh , new bowstrings to Delilah , and she tied Samson with the bowstrings .
ERV	Judges	16	9	Some men were hiding in the next room . Delilah said to Samson , “ Samson , the Philistine men are going to capture you ! ” But Samson easily broke the bowstrings . They snapped like a string when it comes too close to a flame . So the Philistines did not find out the secret of Samson ’ s strength .
ERV	Judges	16	10	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ You lied to me . You made me look foolish . Please tell me the truth . How could someone tie you up ? ”
ERV	Judges	16	11	Samson said , “ Someone would have to tie me up with new ropes . They would have to tie me with ropes that have not been used before . If someone did that , I would become as weak as any other man. ”
ERV	Judges	16	12	So Delilah took some new ropes and tied up Samson . Some men were hiding in the next room . Then Delilah called out to him , “ Samson , the Philistine men are going to capture you ! ” But he broke the ropes easily as if they were threads .
ERV	Judges	16	13	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ You lied to me again . You made me look foolish . Now , tell me how someone could tie you up. ” Samson said , “ If you use the loom to weave the seven braids of hair on my head and tighten it with a pin , I will become as weak as any other man. ”
ERV	Judges	16	14	Later , Samson went to sleep , so Delilah used the loom to weave the seven braids of hair on his head . [ c ] Then Delilah fastened the loom to the ground with a tent peg . Again she called out to him , “ Samson , the Philistine men are going to capture you ! ” Samson pulled up the tent peg , the loom , and the shuttle . [ d ]
ERV	Judges	16	15	Then Delilah said to Samson , “ How can you say , ‘ I love you , ’ when you don ’ t even trust me ? You refuse to tell me your secret . This is the third time you made me look foolish . You haven ’ t told me the secret of your great strength. ”
ERV	Judges	16	17	Finally , Samson told Delilah everything . He said , “ I have never had my hair cut . I was dedicated to God before I was born . If someone shaved my head , I would lose my strength . I would become as weak as any other man. ”
ERV	Judges	16	18	Delilah saw that Samson had told her his secret . She sent a message to the rulers of the Philistines . She said , “ Come back again . Samson has told me everything. ” So the rulers of the Philistines came back and brought the money that they had promised to give her .
ERV	Judges	16	19	Delilah got Samson to go to sleep with his head lying in her lap . Then she called in a man to shave off the seven braids of Samson ’ s hair . In this way she made Samson weak , and his strength left him .
ERV	Judges	16	20	years . Footnotes - Judges 16:5
ERV	Judges	16	21	The Philistine men captured Samson . They tore out his eyes and took him down to the city of Gaza . Then they put chains on him to keep him from running away . They put him in prison and made him work grinding grain .
ERV	Judges	16	22	But his hair began to grow again .
ERV	Judges	16	23	The Philistine rulers came together to celebrate . They were going to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon . They said , “ Our god helped us defeat Samson our enemy. ”
ERV	Judges	16	24	When the Philistines saw Samson , they praised their god . They said , “ This man destroyed our people ! He killed many of our people ! But our god helped us take our enemy ! ”
ERV	Judges	16	25	The people were having a good time at the celebration . So they said , “ Bring Samson out . We want to make fun of him. ” So they brought Samson from the prison and made fun of him . They made him stand between the columns in the temple of the god Dagon .
ERV	Judges	16	26	A servant was holding his hand . Samson said to him , “ Put me where I can feel the columns that hold this temple up . I want to lean against them. ”
ERV	Judges	16	27	The temple was crowded with men and women . All the Philistine rulers were there . There were about
ERV	Judges	16	3000	men and women on the roof of the temple . They were laughing and making fun of Samson .
ERV	Judges	16	29	Then Samson took hold of the two columns in the center of the temple that supported the whole temple . He braced himself between the two columns . One column was at his right side and the other at his left side .
ERV	Judges	16	30	Samson said , “ Let me die with these Philistines ! ” Then he pushed as hard as he could , and the temple fell on the rulers and everyone in it . In this way Samson killed many more Philistines when he died than when he was alive .
ERV	Judges	16	31	Samson ’ s brothers and all the people in his father ’ s family went down to get his body . They brought him back and buried him in his father ’ s tomb , which is between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol . Samson was a judge for the Israelites for

ERV	Judges	17	17	There was a man named Micah who lived in the hill country of Ephraim .
ERV	Judges	17	2	Micah said to his mother , “ Do you remember that someone stole
ERV	Judges	17	28	pounds Literally , “
ERV	Judges	17	3	. - Judges 17:4 about
ERV	Judges	17	4	ounces Literally , “
ERV	Judges	17	5	pounds Literally , “
ERV	Judges	17	6	( At that time the Israelites did not have a king , so everyone did what they thought was right . )
ERV	Judges	17	7	There was a young man who was a Levite from the city of Bethlehem in Judah . He had been living among the tribe of Judah .
ERV	Judges	17	8	He left Bethlehem to look for another place to live . As he was traveling , he came to Micah ’ s house in the hill country of the land of Ephraim .
ERV	Judges	17	9	Micah asked him , “ Where have you come from ? ” The young man answered , “ I am a Levite from the city of Bethlehem in Judah . I am looking for a place to live. ”
ERV	Judges	17	10	shekels ” (
ERV	Judges	17	11	The young Levite agreed to live with Micah . He became like one of Micah ’ s own sons .
ERV	Judges	17	12	Micah chose him to be his priest . So the young man became a priest and lived in Micah ’ s house .
ERV	Judges	17	13	And Micah said , “ Now I know that the Lord will be good to me . I know this because I have a man from the tribe of Levi to be my priest. ” Footnotes - Judges 17:2
ERV	Judges	17	1100	shekels ” ( 12.6 kg ) . Also in verse
ERV	Judges	17	200	shekels ” ( 2.3 kg ) . - Judges 17:4 silversmith A person who makes things from silver . - Judges 17:5 ephod This may have been a special vest or coat like that worn by the high priest ( see Ex . 28:2-14 ) , or it may have been a kind of idol . Also in 18:14 . - Judges 17:10
ERV	Judges	17	115	g ) .
ERV	Judges	18	18	At that time the Israelites did not have a king . And the tribe of Dan was still looking for a place to live . They did not have their own land yet . The other tribes of Israel already had their land , but the tribe of Dan had not taken their land yet .
ERV	Judges	18	2	So the tribe of Dan sent five soldiers to look for some land . They went to search for a good place to live . These five men were from the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol . They were chosen because they were from all the families of Dan . They were told , “ Go , look for some land. ” The five men came to the hill country of Ephraim . They came to Micah ’ s house and spent the night there .
ERV	Judges	18	3	When the five men came close to Micah ’ s house , they heard the voice of the young Levite . They recognized his voice , so they stopped at Micah ’ s house . They asked the young man , “ Who brought you to this place ? What are you doing ? Why are you here ? ”
ERV	Judges	18	4	The young man told them what Micah had done for him . “ Micah hired me , ” he said . “ I am his priest. ”
ERV	Judges	18	5	So they said to him , “ Please ask God if our search for a place to live will be successful. ”
ERV	Judges	18	6	The priest said to the five men , “ Yes . Go in peace . The Lord will lead you on your way. ”
ERV	Judges	18	7	So the five men left . They came to the city of Laish and saw that the people of that city lived in safety . They were ruled by the people of Sidon . Everything was peaceful and quiet . The people had plenty of everything , and they didn ’ t have any enemies nearby to hurt them . Also they lived a long way from the city of Sidon , and they did not have any agreements with the people of Aram . [ a ]
ERV	Judges	18	8	The five men went back to the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol . Their relatives asked them , “ What did you learn ? ”
ERV	Judges	18	9	The five men answered , “ We have found some land , and it is very good . We should attack them . Don ’ t wait ! Let ’ s go and take that land !
ERV	Judges	18	10	When you come to that place , you will see that there is plenty of land . There is plenty of everything there . You will also see that the people are not expecting an attack . Surely God has given that land to us. ”
ERV	Judges	18	11	So
ERV	Judges	18	600	men from the tribe of Dan and the Levite priest turned and left Micah ’ s house . They put their little children , their animals , and all their things in front of them .
ERV	Judges	18	12	On their way to the city of Laish , they stopped near the city of Kiriath Jearim in the land of Judah . They set up a camp there . That is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is named Mahaneh Dan [ b ] to this very day .
ERV	Judges	18	13	From there the
ERV	Judges	18	14	So the five men who had explored the land around Laish spoke . They said to their relatives , “ There is an ephod in one of these houses . And there are also household gods , a carved statue , and a silver idol . You know what to do. ”
ERV	Judges	18	15	So they stopped at Micah ’ s house , where the young Levite lived . They asked the young man how he was .
ERV	Judges	18	16	The
ERV	Judges	18	19	The five men answered , “ Be quiet ! Don ’ t say a word . Come with us . Be our father and our priest . You must choose . Is it better for you to be a priest for just one man or for a whole tribe of Israelites with many family groups ? ”
ERV	Judges	18	20	This made the Levite happy . So he took the ephod , the household idols , and the idol . He went with the men from the tribe of Dan .
ERV	Judges	18	21	Then the
ERV	Judges	18	22	The men from the tribe of Dan went a long way from that place . But the people living near Micah met together . Then they began chasing the men of Dan and caught up with them .
ERV	Judges	18	23	The men with Micah were shouting at the men of Dan . The men of Dan turned around and said to Micah , “ What ’ s the problem ? Why are you shouting ? ”
ERV	Judges	18	24	Micah answered , “ You men from Dan took my idols . I made them for myself . You have also taken my priest . What do I have left now ? How can you ask me , ‘ What ’ s the problem ? ’ ”
ERV	Judges	18	25	The men from the tribe of Dan answered , “ You had better not argue with us . Some of our men become angry easily . If you shout at us , they will attack you . You and your families will be killed. ”
ERV	Judges	18	26	Then the men of Dan turned around and went on their way . Micah knew that these men were too strong for him , so he went back home .
ERV	Judges	18	27	So the men of Dan took the idols that Micah made . They also took the priest who had been with Micah . Then they came to Laish . They attacked the people living in Laish . Those people were at peace . They were not expecting an attack . The men of Dan killed them with their swords and then burned the city .
ERV	Judges	18	28	The people living in Laish did not have anyone to rescue them . They lived too far from the city of Sidon for the people there to help . And the people of Laish did not have any agreements with the people of Aram—so they did not help them . The city of Laish was in a valley , which belonged to the town of Beth Rehob . The people from Dan built a new city in that place , and it became their home .
ERV	Judges	18	29	The people of Dan gave the city a new name . That city had been called Laish , but they changed the name to Dan . They named the city after their ancestor Dan , one of the sons of Israel .
ERV	Judges	18	30	The people of the tribe of Dan set up the idol in the city of Dan . They made Jonathan son of Gershom their priest . Gershom was the son of Moses . [ c ] Jonathan and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time when the Israelites were taken into captivity .
ERV	Judges	18	31	The people of Dan set up for themselves the idol that Micah had made . That idol was there the whole time that the house of God was in Shiloh . Footnotes - Judges 18:7 they did not have … Aram Or “ they did not have any dealings with people. ” - Judges 18:12 Mahaneh Dan This name means “ The Camp of Dan. ” - Judges 18:30 Moses Or “ Manasseh . ”
ERV	Judges	19	19	We already have straw and food for our donkeys . There is also bread and wine for me , the young woman , and my servant . We don ’ t need anything. ”
ERV	Judges	19	2	But his slave woman had an argument with him . She left him and went back to her father ’ s house in Bethlehem in Judah . She stayed there for four months .
ERV	Judges	19	3	Then her husband went after her . He wanted to speak kindly to her so that she would come back to him . He took with him his servant and two donkeys . The Levite came to her father ’ s house . Her father saw the Levite and came out to greet him . The father was very happy .
ERV	Judges	19	4	The woman ’ s father led the Levite into his house . The Levite ’ s father-in-law invited him to stay . So he stayed for three days . He ate , drank , and slept in his father-in-law ’ s house .
ERV	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day , they got up early in the morning . The Levite was getting ready to leave . But the young woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , “ Eat something first . After you eat , you can go. ”
ERV	Judges	19	6	So the Levite and his father-in-law sat down to eat and drink together . After that the young woman ’ s father said to the Levite , “ Please stay tonight . Relax and enjoy yourself. ” So the two men ate together .
ERV	Judges	19	7	The Levite got up to leave , but his father-in-law persuaded him to stay the night again .
ERV	Judges	19	8	Then , on the fifth day , the Levite got up early in the morning . He was ready to leave . But the woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , “ Eat something first . Relax and stay until this afternoon. ” So they both ate together again .
ERV	Judges	19	9	Then the Levite , his slave woman , and his servant got up to leave . But the young woman ’ s father said , “ It is almost dark . The day is almost gone . So stay the night here and enjoy yourself . Tomorrow morning you can get up early and go on your way. ”
ERV	Judges	19	10	But the Levite did not want to stay another night . He took his two donkeys and his slave woman . He traveled as far as the city of Jebus ( that is , Jerusalem ) .
ERV	Judges	19	11	The day was almost over . They were near the city of Jebus . So the servant said to his master , the Levite , “ Let ’ s stop at this Jebusite city . Let ’ s stay the night here. ”
ERV	Judges	19	12	parts of the woman to each of the areas where the Israelites lived .
ERV	Judges	19	13	The Levite said , “ Come on . Let ’ s try to make it to Gibeah or Ramah . We can stay the night in one of those cities. ”
ERV	Judges	19	14	So the Levite and those with him traveled on . The sun was going down just as they entered the city of Gibeah . Gibeah is in the area that belongs to the tribe of Benjamin .
ERV	Judges	19	15	They planned to stop there and stay the night . They came to the city square and sat down , but no one invited them home to stay the night .
ERV	Judges	19	16	That evening an old man came into the city from the fields . His home was in the hill country of Ephraim , but now he was living in the city of Gibeah . ( The men of Gibeah were from the tribe of Benjamin . )
ERV	Judges	19	17	The old man saw the traveler in the public square and asked , “ Where are you going ? Where did you come from ? ”
ERV	Judges	19	18	The Levite answered , “ We have come from Bethlehem in Judah , where I went for a visit . Now I am on my way home , [ b ] which is a long way into the hill country of Ephraim . I expected that someone here would invite us in for the night , but no one has .
ERV	Judges	19	20	The old man said , “ You are welcome to stay at my house . I will give you anything you need , but don ’ t stay the night in the public square. ”
ERV	Judges	19	21	Then the old man took the Levite and the people with him to his house . He fed their donkeys . They washed their feet and then had something to eat and drink .
ERV	Judges	19	22	While the Levite and those who were with him were enjoying themselves , some very bad men from the city surrounded the house . They began beating on the door . They shouted at the old man who owned the house . They said , “ Bring out the man who came to your house . We want to have sex with him. ”
ERV	Judges	19	23	The old man went outside and said to them , “ My friends , don ’ t do such an evil thing ! This man is a guest in my house . [ c ] Don ’ t commit this terrible sin .
ERV	Judges	19	24	Look , here is my daughter . She has never had sex before . I will bring her out to you now . This man also has a slave woman . You can use them any way you want , but don ’ t do such a terrible sin against this man. ”
ERV	Judges	19	25	But those evil men would not listen to the old man . So the Levite took his slave woman and put her outside with them . They hurt her and raped her all night long . Then , at dawn , they let her go .
ERV	Judges	19	26	At dawn , the woman came back to the house where her master was staying . She fell down at the front door and lay there until it was daylight .
ERV	Judges	19	27	The Levite got up early the next morning . He wanted to go home . He opened the door to go outside , and a hand fell across the threshold of the door . There was his slave woman . She had fallen down against the door .
ERV	Judges	19	28	The Levite said to her , “ Get up ; let ’ s go. ” But there was no answer . The Levite put her body on his donkey and went home .
ERV	Judges	19	29	When he arrived at his house , he took a knife and cut her body into
ERV	Judges	19	30	Everyone who saw this said , “ Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel before . We haven ’ t seen anything like this from the time we came out of Egypt . Discuss this and tell us what to do. ” Footnotes - Judges 19:12 Gibeah Gibeah was a few miles north of Jebus . Jebus was the old name for Jerusalem . - Judges 19:18 home This is from the ancient Greek version , which has “ to my house. ” The standard Hebrew text has “ to the Lord ’ s house. ” - Judges 19:23 This man … my house At this time it was a custom that if you invited people to be your guests , you had to protect and care for those people .
ERV	Judges	20	20	Then the army of Israel took their positions for battle against the army of Benjamin at the city of Gibeah .
ERV	Judges	20	2	The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were there . They took their places in the public meeting of God ’ s people . There were 400,000 soldiers with swords in that place .
ERV	Judges	20	3	The people from the tribe of Benjamin heard that the Israelites were meeting together in Mizpah . The Israelites said , “ Tell us how this terrible thing happened. ”
ERV	Judges	20	4	So the Levite , the husband of the woman who had been murdered , told them the story . He said , “ My slave woman and I came to the city of Gibeah in the area of Benjamin . We spent the night there .
ERV	Judges	20	5	But during the night the men of the city of Gibeah came to the house where I was staying . They surrounded the house , and they wanted to kill me . They raped my slave woman , and she died .
ERV	Judges	20	6	So I took her and cut her into pieces . Then I sent one piece to each of the tribes of Israel . I sent the
ERV	Judges	20	12	The tribes of Israel sent men to the tribe of Benjamin with this message : “ What about this terrible thing that some of your men have done ?
ERV	Judges	20	7	Now , all you men of Israel , speak up . Give your decision about what we should do. ”
ERV	Judges	20	8	Then all the people stood up at the same time . They said together , “ None of us will go home . No , not one of us will go back to his house .
ERV	Judges	20	9	Now this is what we will do to the city of Gibeah . We will throw lots to let God show us who will lead the attack .
ERV	Judges	20	10	We will choose ten men from every
ERV	Judges	20	100	men from every
ERV	Judges	20	1000	men from every 10,000 . These men we have chosen will get supplies for the army . Then the army will go to the city of Gibeah in the area of Benjamin . The army will punish those people for the terrible thing they did among the Israelites. ”
ERV	Judges	20	11	So all the men of Israel gathered together at the city of Gibeah , united together and in agreement as to what they were doing .
ERV	Judges	20	13	Send the bad men from the city of Gibeah to us so that we can put them to death . We must remove the evil from among the Israelites. ” But the people from the tribe of Benjamin would not listen to the messengers from their relatives , the other Israelites .
ERV	Judges	20	14	The people from the tribe of Benjamin left their cities and went to the city of Gibeah . They went to Gibeah to fight against the other tribes of Israel .
ERV	Judges	20	15	The people from the tribe of Benjamin got 26,000 soldiers together who were trained for war . They also had
ERV	Judges	20	700	trained soldiers who were trained to fight with their left hand . [ c ] Each one of them could use a sling with great skill . They all could use a sling to throw a stone at a hair and not miss !
ERV	Judges	20	16	There were also
ERV	Judges	20	17	All the tribes of Israel , except Benjamin , gathered together 400,000 fighting men with swords . Each one was a trained soldier .
ERV	Judges	20	18	The Israelites went up to the city of Bethel . At Bethel they asked God , “ Which tribe will be first to attack the tribe of Benjamin ? ” The Lord answered , “ The tribe of Judah will go first. ”
ERV	Judges	20	19	The next morning the Israelites got up . They made a camp near the city of Gibeah .
ERV	Judges	20	21	Then the army of Benjamin came out of the city of Gibeah . The army of Benjamin killed 22,000 men in the army of Israel during the battle that day . 22-23 The Israelites went to the Lord and cried until evening . They asked the Lord , “ Should we go to fight the people of Benjamin again ? They are our relatives. ” The Lord answered , “ Go fight against them. ” The men of Israel encouraged each other . So they again went out to fight , as they had done the first day .
ERV	Judges	20	24	Then the army of Israel came near the army of Benjamin . This was the second day of the war .
ERV	Judges	20	25	The army of Benjamin came out of the city of Gibeah to attack the army of Israel on the second day . This time , the army of Benjamin killed another 18,000 men from the army of Israel . All the men in the army of Israel were trained soldiers .
ERV	Judges	20	26	Then all the Israelites went up to the city of Bethel . There they sat down and cried to the Lord . They did not eat anything all day , until evening . They also offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord .
ERV	Judges	20	27	The men of Israel asked the Lord a question . ( In those days God ’ s Box of the Agreement was there at Bethel .
ERV	Judges	20	28	Phinehas was the priest who served God there . Phinehas was the son of Eleazar . Eleazar was the son of Aaron . ) The Israelites asked , “ The people of Benjamin are our relatives . Should we again go to fight against them ? Or should we stop fighting ? ” The Lord answered , “ Go . Tomorrow I will help you defeat them. ”
ERV	Judges	20	29	Then the army of Israel hid some men all around the city of Gibeah .
ERV	Judges	20	30	Israelite soldiers . So the men of Benjamin were saying , “ We are winning , as before. ” But then a big cloud of smoke began to rise from the city . The men of Benjamin turned around and saw the smoke . The whole city was on fire . Then the army of Israel stopped running away . They turned around and began to fight . The men of Benjamin were afraid because they knew that a terrible thing had happened to them .
ERV	Judges	20	31	The army of Benjamin came out of the city of Gibeah to fight the army of Israel . The army of Israel backed up and let the army of Benjamin chase them . In this way the army of Benjamin was tricked into leaving the city far behind them . The army of Benjamin began to kill some of the men in the army of Israel , as they had done before . They killed about
ERV	Judges	20	32	The men of Benjamin said , “ We are winning as before ! ” The men of Israel were running away , but it was a trick . They wanted to lead the men of Benjamin away from their city and onto the roads .
ERV	Judges	20	33	So all the men ran away . They stopped at a place named Baal Tamar . Some of the men of Israel were hiding west of Gibeah . They ran from their hiding places .
ERV	Judges	20	34	10,000 of Israel ’ s best-trained soldiers attacked the city of Gibeah . The fighting was very heavy . But the army of Benjamin did not know that a terrible thing was about to happen to them .
ERV	Judges	20	35	The Lord used the army of Israel and defeated the army of Benjamin . On that day the army of Israel killed 25,100 soldiers from Benjamin . All of them had been trained for war .
ERV	Judges	20	36	So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated . The army of Israel had moved back because they were depending on the surprise attack . They had men hiding near Gibeah .
ERV	Judges	20	37	The men who were hiding rushed into the city of Gibeah . They spread out and killed everyone in the city with their swords .
ERV	Judges	20	38	Now the men of Israel had made a plan with the men who were hiding . The men who were hiding were supposed to send a special signal . They were supposed to make a big cloud of smoke . 39-41 The army of Benjamin had killed about
ERV	Judges	20	42	So the army of Benjamin ran away from the army of Israel . They ran toward the desert . But they could not escape the fighting . And the men of Israel came out of the cities and killed them .
ERV	Judges	20	43	The men of Israel surrounded the men of Benjamin and began chasing them . They did not let them rest . They defeated them in the area east of Gibeah .
ERV	Judges	20	44	So 18,000 brave and strong fighters from the army of Benjamin were killed .
ERV	Judges	20	45	The army of Benjamin turned around and ran toward the desert . They ran to a place called the Rock of Rimmon , but the army of Israel killed
ERV	Judges	20	5000	soldiers from Benjamin along the roads . They kept chasing the men of Benjamin . They chased them as far as a place named Gidom . The army of Israel killed
ERV	Judges	20	2000	more men from Benjamin in that place .
ERV	Judges	20	46	On that day 25,000 men of the army of Benjamin were killed . All of them fought bravely with their swords .
ERV	Judges	20	47	But
ERV	Judges	20	600	men from Benjamin ran into the desert to the place called the Rock of Rimmon and stayed there for four months .
ERV	Judges	20	48	The men of Israel went back to the land of Benjamin . They killed the people and all the animals in every city . They destroyed everything they could find and burned every city they came to . Footnotes - Judges 20:1 from everywhere in Israel Literally , “ from Dan to Beersheba. ” - Judges 20:1 Gilead This area was east of the Jordan River . - Judges 20:16 trained … left hand Literally , “ restrained in their right hand . ”
ERV	Judges	21	21	Watch for the time during the festival when the young women from Shiloh come out to join the dancing . Then run out from where you are hiding in the vineyards . Each of you should take one of the young women from the city of Shiloh . Take them to the land of Benjamin and marry them .
ERV	Judges	21	2	The Israelites went to the city of Bethel . There they sat before God until evening . They cried loudly as they sat there .
ERV	Judges	21	3	They said to God , “ Lord , you are the God of the Israelites . Why has this terrible thing happened to us ? Why has one tribe of the Israelites been taken away ? ”
ERV	Judges	21	4	Early the next day , the Israelites built an altar . They put burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to God on that altar .
ERV	Judges	21	5	Then the Israelites said , “ Are there any tribes of Israel who did not come here to meet with us before the Lord ? ” They asked this question because they had made a serious promise . They had promised that anyone who did not come together with the other tribes at the city of Mizpah would be killed .
ERV	Judges	21	6	Then the Israelites felt sorry for their relatives , the people of Benjamin . They said , “ Today , one tribe has been separated from Israel .
ERV	Judges	21	7	We made a promise with an oath before the Lord . We promised not to allow our daughters to marry a man from Benjamin . How can we make sure that the men of Benjamin will have wives ? ”
ERV	Judges	21	8	Then the Israelites asked , “ Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come here to Mizpah ? We have come together before the Lord . Surely one family was not here ! ” Then they found that no one from the city of Jabesh Gilead had met together with the other Israelites .
ERV	Judges	21	9	The Israelites counted everyone to see who was there and who was not . They found that no one from Jabesh Gilead was there .
ERV	Judges	21	10	So the Israelites sent 12,000 soldiers to the city of Jabesh Gilead . They told the soldiers , “ Go to Jabesh Gilead , and use your swords to kill everyone who lives there , even the women and children .
ERV	Judges	21	11	You must do this ! You must kill every man in Jabesh Gilead and every woman who has had sexual relations with a man . But do not kill any woman who has never had sex with a man. ” So the soldiers did these things . [ a ]
ERV	Judges	21	12	The 12,000 soldiers found
ERV	Judges	21	400	young women in the city of Jabesh Gilead who had never had sex with a man . They brought these women to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan .
ERV	Judges	21	13	Then the Israelites sent a message to the men of Benjamin . They offered to make peace with the men of Benjamin . The men of Benjamin were at the place named the Rock of Rimmon .
ERV	Judges	21	14	So the men of Benjamin came back to Israel . The Israelites gave them the women from Jabesh Gilead who they had not killed . But there were not enough women for all the men of Benjamin .
ERV	Judges	21	15	The Israelites felt sorry for the men of Benjamin . They felt sorry for them because the Lord had separated them from the other tribes of Israel .
ERV	Judges	21	16	The elders of the Israelites said , “ The women of the tribe of Benjamin have been killed . Where can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are still alive ?
ERV	Judges	21	17	The men of Benjamin who are still alive must have children to continue their families . This must be done so that a tribe in Israel will not die out !
ERV	Judges	21	18	But we can not allow our daughters to marry the men of Benjamin . We have made this promise : ‘ Bad things will happen to anyone who gives a wife to a man of Benjamin. ’
ERV	Judges	21	19	We have an idea ! This is the time for the festival of the Lord at the city of Shiloh . This festival is celebrated every year there. ” ( The city of Shiloh is north of the city of Bethel and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem . And it is also to the south of the city of Lebonah . )
ERV	Judges	21	20	So the elders told the men of Benjamin about their idea . They said , “ Go and hide in the vineyards .
ERV	Judges	21	22	The fathers or brothers of the young women will come and complain to us . But we will say , ‘ Be kind to the men of Benjamin . Let them marry the women . We could not get wives for each of them during the war . And you did not willingly give the women to the men of Benjamin , so you did not break your promise. ’ ”
ERV	Judges	21	23	So that is what the men of the tribe of Benjamin did . While the young women were dancing , each man caught one of them . They took them away and married them . Then they went back to their land . The men of Benjamin built cities again in that land , and they lived in them .
ERV	Judges	21	24	Then the Israelites went home . They went to their own land and tribe .
ERV	Judges	21	25	In those days the Israelites did not have a king , so everyone did whatever they thought was right . Footnotes - Judges 21:11 But do not kill … these things This is from the ancient Greek version .
ERV	Ruth	1	1	Long ago , during the time the judges ruled , there was a famine in the land , and a man named Elimelech left the town of Bethlehem in Judah . He , his wife , and his two sons moved to the country of Moab .
ERV	Ruth	1	2	The man ’ s wife was named Naomi , and his two sons were named Mahlon and Kilion . They were from the Ephrathah family of Bethlehem in Judah . The family traveled to the hill country of Moab and stayed there .
ERV	Ruth	1	3	Later , Naomi ’ s husband , Elimelech , died , so only Naomi and her two sons were left .
ERV	Ruth	1	4	Her sons married women from the country of Moab . One wife ’ s name was Orpah , and the other wife ’ s name was Ruth . They lived in Moab about ten years ;
ERV	Ruth	1	5	then Mahlon and Kilion also died . So Naomi was left alone without her husband or her two sons . Naomi Goes Home
ERV	Ruth	1	6	While Naomi was in the country of Moab , she heard that the Lord had helped his people . He had given food to his people in Judah . So Naomi decided to leave the hill country of Moab and go back home . Her daughters-in-law also decided to go with her .
ERV	Ruth	1	7	They left the place where they had been living and started walking back to the land of Judah .
ERV	Ruth	1	8	Then Naomi told her daughters-in-law , “ Each of you should go back home to your mother . You have been very kind to me and my sons who are now dead . So I pray that the Lord will be just as kind to you .
ERV	Ruth	1	9	I pray that the Lord will help each of you find a husband and a good home. ” Naomi kissed her daughters-in-law , and they all started crying .
ERV	Ruth	1	10	Then the daughters said , “ But we want to come with you and go to your family. ”
ERV	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said , “ No , daughters , go back to your own homes . Why should you go with me ? I can ’ t have any more sons to be your husbands .
ERV	Ruth	1	12	Go back home . I am too old to have a new husband . Even if I thought I could be married again , I could not help you . If I became pregnant tonight and had two sons ,
ERV	Ruth	1	13	you would have to wait until they grew to become men before you could marry them . I can not make you wait that long for husbands . That would make me very sad . And I am already sad enough—the Lord has done many things to me ! ”
ERV	Ruth	1	14	So again they cried very much . Then Orpah kissed Naomi goodbye , but Ruth hugged her and stayed .
ERV	Ruth	1	15	Naomi said , “ Look , your sister-in-law has gone back to her own people and her own gods . You should do the same. ”
ERV	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth said , “ Don ’ t force me to leave you ! Don ’ t force me to go back to my own people . Let me go with you . Wherever you go , I will go . Wherever you sleep , I will sleep . Your people will be my people . Your God will be my God .
ERV	Ruth	1	17	Where you die , I will die , and that is where I will be buried . I ask the Lord to punish me if I don ’ t keep this promise : Only death will separate us. ” [ a ] The Homecoming
ERV	Ruth	1	18	Naomi saw that Ruth wanted very much to go with her . So Naomi stopped arguing with her .
ERV	Ruth	1	19	Naomi and Ruth traveled until they came to the town of Bethlehem . When the two women entered Bethlehem , all the people were very excited . They said , “ Is this Naomi ? ”
ERV	Ruth	1	20	But Naomi told the people , “ Don ’ t call me Naomi [ b ] ; call me Marah . [ c ] Use this name because God All-Powerful has made my life very sad .
ERV	Ruth	1	21	I had everything I wanted when I left , but now , the Lord brings me home with nothing . The Lord has made me sad , so why should you call me ‘ Happy ’ [ d ] ? God All-Powerful has given much trouble to me. ”
ERV	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth , the Moabite , came back from the hill country of Moab . These two women came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest .
ERV	Ruth	2	2	One day Ruth , the Moabite , said to Naomi , “ I think I will go to the fields . Maybe I can find someone who will be kind to me and let me gather the grain they leave in their field. ” Naomi said , “ Fine , daughter , go ahead. ”
ERV	Ruth	2	3	So Ruth went to the fields . She followed the workers who were cutting the grain and gathered the grain that was left . [ b ] It happened that part of the field belonged to Boaz , the man from Elimelech ’ s family .
ERV	Ruth	2	4	Later , Boaz came to the field from Bethlehem and greeted his workers . He said , “ The Lord be with you ! ” And the workers answered , “ And may the Lord bless you ! ”
ERV	Ruth	2	5	Then Boaz spoke to his servant who was in charge of the workers . He asked , “ Whose girl is that ? ”
ERV	Ruth	2	6	The servant answered , “ She is the Moabite woman who came with Naomi from the country of Moab .
ERV	Ruth	2	7	She came early this morning and asked me if she could follow the workers and gather the grain that was left on the ground . She rested only a short time in that shelter. ” [ c ]
ERV	Ruth	2	8	Then Boaz said to Ruth , “ Listen , child . Stay here in my field to gather grain for yourself . There is no need for you to go to any other field . Continue following behind my women workers .
ERV	Ruth	2	9	Watch to see which fields they go into to cut the grain and follow them . I have warned the young men not to bother you . When you are thirsty , go and drink from the same water jug my men drink from. ”
ERV	Ruth	2	10	Then Ruth bowed very low to the ground . She said to Boaz , “ I am a foreigner , so I am surprised you even noticed me. ”
ERV	Ruth	2	11	Boaz answered her , “ I know about all the help you have given to your mother-in-law Naomi . I know you helped her even after your husband died . And I know that you left your father and mother and your own country and came here to this country . You did not know anyone from this country , but you came here with Naomi .
ERV	Ruth	2	12	The Lord will reward you for all the good things you have done . The Lord , the God of Israel , will pay you in full . You have come to him for safety , [ d ] and he will protect you. ”
ERV	Ruth	2	13	Then Ruth said , “ I hope I can continue to please you , sir . You are very kind . I am only a servant and not even one of your own servants . But you have said kind words to me and comforted me. ”
ERV	Ruth	2	14	At mealtime , Boaz told Ruth , “ Come and eat some of our bread . Here , dip your bread in our vinegar. ” So Ruth sat down with the workers . Boaz gave her some roasted grain . Ruth ate until she was full , and there was some food left .
ERV	Ruth	2	15	Then Ruth got up and went back to work . Then Boaz told his servants , “ Let Ruth gather even around the piles of grain . Don ’ t stop her .
ERV	Ruth	2	16	And make her work easier by dropping some full heads of grain for her . Let her gather that grain . Don ’ t tell her to stop. ” Naomi Hears About Boaz
ERV	Ruth	2	17	Ruth worked in the fields until evening . Then she separated the grain from the chaff . There was about one-half bushel [ e ] of barley .
ERV	Ruth	2	18	Ruth carried the grain into town to show her mother-in-law what she had gathered . She also gave her the food that was left from lunch .
ERV	Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law asked her , “ Where did you gather all this grain ? Where did you work ? Bless the man who noticed you. ” Then Ruth told her who she had worked with . She said , “ The man I worked with today is a man named Boaz. ”
ERV	Ruth	2	20	Naomi told her daughter-in-law , “ The Lord bless him ! He has continued showing his kindness to the living as well as the dead. ” Then Naomi told her daughter-in-law , “ Boaz is one of our relatives . He is one of our protectors . [ f ] ”
ERV	Ruth	2	21	Then Ruth said , “ Boaz also told me to come back and continue working . He said that I should work closely with his servants until the harvest is finished. ”

ERV	Ruth	2	23	So Ruth continued working closely with the women servants of Boaz . She gathered grain until the barley harvest was finished . She also worked there through the end of the wheat harvest . Ruth continued living with her mother-in-law Naomi . Footnotes - Ruth 2:1 close relatives If a man died without children , one of his close relatives would take the dead man ’ s wife so that she could have children . He would care for this family , but this family and their property would not belong to him . They would all be in the dead man ’ s name . - Ruth 2:3 There was a law that a farmer must leave some grain in his field during harvest , so poor people and travelers could find something to eat . See Lev . 19:9 ; 23:22 . - Ruth 2:7 She … shelter Or “ That is her house over there. ” - Ruth 2:12 You have … for safety Literally , “ You have come under his wings for safety. ” - Ruth 2:17 one-half bushel Literally , “ one ephah ” (
ERV	Ruth	3	3	,
ERV	Ruth	3	2	Boaz is our close relative . [ a ] You worked with his women servants . Tonight he will be working at the threshing floor .
ERV	Ruth	3	4	After he eats , he will lie down to rest . Watch him so that you will know where he lies down . Go there and lift the cover off his feet . [ b ] Then lie down there with Boaz . He will tell you what you should do about marriage. ”
ERV	Ruth	3	5	Then Ruth answered , “ I will do what you say. ”
ERV	Ruth	3	6	. - Ruth 3:4 lift the cover off his feet Literally , “ uncover his legs. ” This showed that Ruth was asking Boaz to be her protector . - Ruth 3:9 Spread your cover over me Or “ Spread your wing over me. ” This showed that Ruth was asking for help and protection . See Ruth 2:12 . - Ruth 3:13 help Or “ redeem. ” This meant the close relative would care for and protect the dead man ’ s family and property , but that property would not be his . - Ruth 3:13 I will marry … you Literally , “ I will redeem you. ” - Ruth 3:15 bushel of barley Literally , “ six measures of barley . ”
ERV	Ruth	3	7	After eating and drinking , Boaz was very satisfied . He went to lie down near the pile of grain . Then Ruth went to him very quietly and lifted the cover from his feet and lay down by his feet .
ERV	Ruth	3	8	About midnight , Boaz rolled over in his sleep and woke up . He was very surprised . There was a woman lying near his feet .
ERV	Ruth	3	9	Boaz said , “ Who are you ? ” She said , “ I am Ruth , your servant girl . Spread your cover over me . [ c ] You are my protector. ”
ERV	Ruth	3	10	Then Boaz said , “ May the Lord bless you , young woman . You have been very kind to me . Your kindness to me is greater than the kindness you showed to Naomi in the beginning . You could have looked for a young man to marry , rich or poor . But you did not .
ERV	Ruth	3	11	Now , young woman , don ’ t be afraid . I will do what you ask . All the people in our town know that you are a very good woman .
ERV	Ruth	3	12	; 4:1 ,

ERV	Ruth	3	14	So Ruth lay near Boaz ’ s feet until morning . She got up while it was still dark , before it was light enough for people to recognize each other . Boaz said to her , “ We will keep it a secret that you came here to me last night. ”
ERV	Ruth	3	15	Then he said , “ Bring me your coat . Now , hold it open. ” So Ruth held her coat open , and Boaz measured out about a bushel of barley [ f ] as a gift to Naomi , her mother-in-law . Boaz then wrapped it in Ruth ’ s coat , and put it on her back . Then he went to the city .

ERV	Ruth	4	4	I decided to tell you about this in front of the people living here and in front of the elders of our people . If you want to pay the widow for the land and keep it in the family , then pay her for it . If you don ’ t want to buy the land , tell me , because I am the next one in the family who has the right to buy it . If you don ’ t buy the land from her , I will. ” Naomi ’ s closest relative said , “ I will buy the land from her. ”
ERV	Ruth	4	2	Boaz also gathered ten of the elders of the city . He told them , “ Sit here ! ” So they sat down .
ERV	Ruth	4	3	Then Boaz spoke to Naomi ’ s close relative . He said , “ Naomi came back from the hill country of Moab . She wants to sell the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech .
ERV	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said , “ If you buy the land from her , you must also marry the dead man ’ s wife , Ruth , the Moabite woman . Then the first child will get the land , and it will stay in the dead man ’ s family. ”
ERV	Ruth	4	6	The close relative answered , “ Then I can not buy the land . If I do , I might lose my own land . So I can not do it . You buy the land. ”
ERV	Ruth	4	7	Then he gave Boaz something to show that he was serious . During that time in Israel , when people bought property , one person took off a sandal and gave it to the other person . This was like signing an agreement .
ERV	Ruth	4	8	So when the close relative said to Boaz , “ You buy the land , ” he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz . [ a ]
ERV	Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people , “ You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech , Kilion , and Mahlon .
ERV	Ruth	4	10	I also take Ruth to be my wife . Then the dead man ’ s property will continue to belong to his family . And he will always be remembered by his family and the people in his hometown . You are all witnesses of what I am doing today. ”
ERV	Ruth	4	11	So all the elders and the people who were near the city gates said , “ We are witnesses to all of this . And may the Lord bless this woman who is coming into your home to be like Rachel and Leah . They are the ones who had many children to make the people of Israel strong . And may you become powerful in the tribe of Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem !
ERV	Ruth	4	12	May the Lord bless you with many children through Ruth . May your family become great like the family of Perez , [ b ] the son Tamar bore for Judah. ”
ERV	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz married Ruth . The Lord allowed Ruth to become pregnant , and she had a son .
ERV	Ruth	4	14	The women there said to Naomi , “ Praise the Lord who gave you this child . [ c ] May he become famous in Israel .
ERV	Ruth	4	15	He will make you alive again and care for you in your old age . Your daughter-in-law made it happen because she bore this child for you . She loves you , and she is better for you than seven sons. ”
ERV	Ruth	4	16	Naomi took the boy , held him in her arms , and cared for him .

ERV	1%20Samuel	2	14	and use it to get some meat out of the pot or kettle . The priest is supposed to take whatever his helper removes from the pot with the special fork . This is what the priests should have done for the Israelites who came to offer sacrifices at Shiloh .
ERV	1%20Samuel	2	15	But that is not what the sons of Eli did . Even before the fat was burned on the altar , their servant would go to the people offering sacrifices and say , “ Give the priest some meat to roast . The priest won ’ t accept boiled meat from you. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	2	16	Maybe the man offering the sacrifice would say , “ Burn the fat [ f ] first , and then you can take whatever you want. ” But the servant would answer : “ No , give me the meat now . If you don ’ t give it to me , I ’ ll take it from you ! ”

ERV	1%20Samuel	2	29	So why don ’ t you respect these gifts and sacrifices ? You honor your sons more than me . You become fat eating the best parts of the meat that the Israelites bring to me. ’
ERV	1%20Samuel	2	30	“ The Lord , the God of Israel , promised that your father ’ s family would serve him forever . But now the Lord says , ‘ That will never be ! I will honor people who honor me , but bad things will happen to those who refuse to respect me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	2	31	The time is coming when I will destroy all your descendants . No one in your family will live to be an old man .
ERV	1%20Samuel	2	32	Good things will happen to Israel , but you will see bad things happening at home . [ h ] No one in your family will live to be an old man .
ERV	1%20Samuel	2	33	There is only one man I will save to serve as priest at my altar . He will live until his eyes wear out and his strength is gone . But all of your descendants will die by the sword . [ i ]

ERV	1%20Samuel	2	35	I will choose a priest I can trust . This priest will listen to me and do what I want . I will make his family strong , and he will always serve before my chosen king . [ j ]

ERV	1%20Samuel	13	3	Jonathan defeated the Philistines at their camp in Geba . The Philistines heard about this . They said , “ The Hebrews have rebelled. ” [ c ] Saul said , “ Let the Hebrew people hear what happened. ” So Saul told the men to blow trumpets through all the land of Israel .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	4	All the Israelites heard this news : “ Saul has killed the Philistine leader . Now the Philistines will really hate the Israelites ! ” The Israelites were called to join Saul at Gilgal .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	5	The Philistines gathered to fight Israel . The Philistines camped at Micmash , east of Beth Aven . They had
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	6000	horse soldiers . There were so many Philistines that they were like sand on the seashore .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	6	The Israelites saw that they were in trouble . They felt trapped . They ran away to hide in caves and cracks in the rock . They hid among the rocks , in wells , and in other holes in the ground .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	7	Some Hebrews even went across the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead . Saul was still at Gilgal . All the men in his army were shaking with fear .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	8	Samuel said he would meet Saul at Gilgal . Saul waited there seven days . But Samuel had not yet come to Gilgal , and the soldiers began to leave Saul .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	9	So Saul said , “ Bring me the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings. ” Then Saul offered the burnt offering .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	10	As soon as Saul finished offering that sacrifice , Samuel arrived . Saul went out to meet him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	11	Samuel asked , “ What have you done ? ” Saul answered , “ I saw the soldiers leaving me . You were not here on time , and the Philistines were gathering at Micmash .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	12	I thought to myself , ‘ The Philistines will come here and attack me at Gilgal , and I haven ’ t asked the Lord to help us yet. ’ So I forced myself to offer the burnt offering. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	14	But now your kingdom won ’ t continue . The Lord was looking for a man who wants to obey him . [ e ] He has found that man—and the Lord has chosen him to be the new leader of his people , because you didn ’ t obey his command. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	15	Then Samuel got up and left Gilgal . The Battle at Micmash Saul and the rest of his army left Gilgal [ f ] and went to Gibeah in Benjamin . Saul counted the men who were still with him . There were about

ERV	1%20Samuel	13	16	Saul , his son Jonathan , and the soldiers went to Geba in Benjamin . The Philistines were camped at Micmash .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	17	So their best soldiers began the attack . The Philistine army split into three groups . One group went north on the road to Ophrah , near Shual .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	18	The second group went southeast on the road to Beth Horon , and the third group went east on the road to the border . That road looks over the Valley of Zeboim toward the desert .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	19	There were no blacksmiths in Israel . The Philistines would not allow them because they were afraid the Israelites would make iron swords and spears .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	20	Only the Philistines could sharpen iron tools . So if the Israelites needed to sharpen their plows , hoes , axes , or sickles , they had to go to the Philistines .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	21	The Philistine blacksmiths charged 1/3 ounce [ g ] of silver for sharpening plows and hoes and 1/6 ounce [ h ] of silver for sharpening picks , axes , and the iron tip on ox goads .
ERV	1%20Samuel	13	22	So on the day of battle , none of the Israelite soldiers with Saul had iron swords or spears . Only Saul and his son Jonathan had such weapons .

ERV	1%20Samuel	14	14	That day , Saul ’ s son Jonathan was talking with the young man who carried his weapons . Jonathan said , “ Let ’ s go to the Philistine camp on the other side of the valley. ” But Jonathan did not tell his father .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	2	Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree at the threshing floor [ a ] at the edge of the hill . [ b ] Saul had about
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	600	men with him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	3	One of the men was named Ahijah . Ahijah was a son of Ichabod ’ s brother Ahitub . Ahitub was the son of Phinehas . Phinehas was the son of Eli . Eli had been the Lord ’ s priest at Shiloh . Now Ahijah was the priest who wore the ephod . These men did not know that Jonathan had left .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	4	Jonathan was planning to go through a pass to get to the Philistine camp . There was a large rock on each side of the pass . The large rock on one side was named Bozez . The large rock on the other side was named Seneh .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	5	One of the rocks faced north toward Micmash , and the other faced south toward Geba .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	6	Jonathan said to his young helper who carried his weapons , “ Come on , let ’ s go to the camp of those foreigners . [ c ] Maybe the Lord will use us to defeat them . Nothing can stop the Lord—it doesn ’ t matter if we have many soldiers or just a few soldiers. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	7	The young man who carried Jonathan ’ s weapons said to him , “ Do what you think is best . Whatever you decide , I am with you all the way. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	8	Jonathan said , “ Let ’ s go ! We ’ ll cross the valley and go to the Philistine guards . We ’ ll let them see us .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say to us , ‘ Stay there until we come to you , ’ we will stay where we are . We won ’ t go up to them .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	10	But if the Philistine men say , ‘ Come up here , ’ then we will climb up to them . That will be a sign from God . That will mean that the Lord will allow us to defeat them. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	11	So Jonathan and his helper let the Philistines see them . The Philistine guards said , “ Look ! The Hebrews are coming out of the holes they were hiding in. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	12	The Philistines in the fort shouted to Jonathan and his helper , “ Come up here . We ’ ll teach you a lesson. ” Jonathan said to his helper , “ Follow me up the hill . The Lord is letting Israel defeat the Philistines. ” 13-14 So Jonathan climbed up the hill with his hands and feet , and his helper was right behind him . Jonathan and his helper attacked them . In the first attack , they killed
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	20	Saul gathered his army together and went to the battle . The Philistine soldiers were very confused . They were even fighting each other with their swords .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	15	Great fear spread among the Philistine soldiers—those in the field , in the camp , and at the fort . Even the bravest soldiers were afraid . The ground began to shake , and they were completely overcome with fear .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	16	Saul ’ s guards at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin saw the Philistine soldiers running away in different ways .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	17	Saul said to the army with him , “ Count the men . I want to know who left camp. ” They counted the men . Jonathan and his helper were gone .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	18	Saul said to Ahijah , “ Bring God ’ s Holy Box ! ” ( At that time God ’ s Holy Box was there with the Israelites . ) [ d ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	19	Saul was talking to Ahijah the priest waiting for advice from God . But the noise and confusion in the Philistine camp was growing and growing . Saul was becoming impatient . Finally , he said to Ahijah the priest , “ That ’ s enough . Put your hand down and stop praying. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	21	There were Hebrews who served the Philistines in the past and who stayed in the Philistine camp . But now these Hebrews joined the Israelites with Saul and Jonathan .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	22	All the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard the Philistine soldiers were running away . So these Israelites also joined in the battle and began chasing the Philistines .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	23	So the Lord saved the Israelites that day . The battle moved on past Beth Aven . The whole army was with Saul—he now had about 10,000 men . The battle spread to every city in the hill country of Ephraim . [ e ] Saul Makes Another Mistake
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	24	But Saul made a big mistake that day . [ f ] He made this oath : “ If any man eats food before evening comes , before I finish defeating my enemies , he will be under a curse. ” He made the soldiers promise not to eat . So none of them ate anything . 25-26 Because of the fighting , the people went into some woods . Then they saw a honeycomb on the ground . The Israelites went up to the honeycomb , but they didn ’ t eat any of it . They were afraid to break the promise .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan didn ’ t know about the oath . He didn ’ t hear his father make the soldiers promise not to eat . Jonathan had a stick in his hand , so he dipped the end of the stick into the honeycomb and pulled out some honey . He ate the honey and began to feel much better .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	28	One of the soldiers told Jonathan , “ Your father forced the soldiers to make a special promise . He said that any man who eats today will be under a curse . So the men have not eaten anything . That ’ s why they are weak. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	29	Jonathan said , “ My father has brought a lot of trouble to the land . See how much better I feel after tasting just a little of this honey .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	30	It would have been much better for the men to eat the food that they took from their enemies today . We could have killed more Philistines. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	31	That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines . They fought them all the way from Micmash to Aijalon . So the people were very tired and hungry .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	32	They had taken sheep , cattle , and calves from the Philistines . Now they were so hungry that they killed the animals on the ground and ate them . And the blood was still in the animals .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	33	Someone said to Saul , “ Look , the men are sinning against the Lord . They ’ re eating meat that still has blood in it ! ” Saul said , “ You have sinned . Roll a large stone over here now ! ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	34	Then Saul said , “ Go to the men and tell them that each one must bring his bull and sheep to me . Then the men must kill their bulls and sheep here . Don ’ t sin against the Lord ! Don ’ t eat meat that still has blood in it. ” That night everyone brought their animals and killed them there .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	35	Then Saul built an altar for the Lord . Saul himself began building that altar for the Lord .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	36	Saul said , “ Let ’ s go after the Philistines tonight . We will take everything from them . We will kill them all ! ” The army answered , “ Do whatever you think is best. ” But the priest said , “ Let ’ s ask God. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul asked God , “ Should I go chase the Philistines ? Will you let us defeat the Philistines ? ” But God did not answer Saul that day .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	38	So Saul said , “ Bring all the leaders to me ! Let ’ s find who committed the sin today .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	39	I swear by the Lord who saves Israel , that even if my own son Jonathan sinned , he must die. ” None of the people said a word .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then Saul said to all the Israelites , “ You stand on this side . I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side. ” The soldiers answered , “ As you wish , sir. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	41	Then Saul prayed , “ Lord , God of Israel , why haven ’ t you answered me today ? Show us who sinned . If it was I or my son Jonathan , give Urim . But if it was your people Israel who sinned , give Thummim. ” [ g ] Saul and Jonathan were shown to be the ones who sinned , and the people went free .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	42	Saul said , “ Throw them again to show the guilty one—me or my son Jonathan. ” Jonathan was shown to be the one .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	43	Saul said to Jonathan , “ Tell me what you have done. ” Jonathan told Saul , “ I only tasted a little honey from the end of my stick . Should I die for doing that ? ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	44	Saul said , “ I made an oath and asked God to punish me if I didn ’ t keep it . Jonathan , you must die. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the soldiers said to Saul , “ Jonathan led Israel to a great victory today . Must Jonathan die ? Never ! As surely as the Lord lives , not one hair of Jonathan ’ s head will fall to the ground ! God helped Jonathan fight against the Philistines today. ” So the people saved Jonathan from death .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	46	Saul did not chase the Philistines . The Philistines went back to their place . Saul Fights Israel ’ s Enemies
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	47	Saul took full control of Israel and fought all the enemies who lived around Israel . Saul fought Moab , the Ammonites , Edom , the king of Zobah , and the Philistines . He defeated Israel ’ s enemies wherever he went .
ERV	1%20Samuel	14	48	Saul was very brave . He saved Israel from all the enemies who tried to take things from the Israelites . He even defeated the Amalekites .

ERV	1%20Samuel	14	52	Saul was brave all his life . He fought hard against the Philistines . Any time Saul saw a man who was strong or brave , he took that man and put him into the group of soldiers who stayed near the king and protected him . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Samuel	15	2	The Lord All-Powerful says : ‘ When the Israelites came out of Egypt , the Amalekites tried to stop them from going to Canaan . I saw what the Amalekites did .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go fight against the Amalekites . You must completely destroy the Amalekites and everything that belongs to them . Don ’ t let anything live ; you must kill all the men and women and all of their children and little babies . You must kill all of their cattle and sheep and all of their camels and donkeys. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	4	Saul gathered the army together at Telaim . There were 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 other men , including the men from Judah .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	5	Then Saul went to the city of Amalek and waited in the valley .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	6	He said to the Kenites , “ Go away ! Leave the Amalekites . Then I won ’ t destroy you with the Amalekites . You showed kindness to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt. ” So the Kenites left the Amalekites .

ERV	1%20Samuel	15	8	Agag was the king of the Amalekites . Saul captured Agag alive . Saul let Agag live , but he killed all the men in Agag ’ s army .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	9	Saul and the Israelite soldiers felt bad about destroying everything . So they let Agag live . They also kept the fat cattle , the best sheep , and the lambs . They kept everything that was worth keeping . They didn ’ t want to destroy those things . They destroyed only what was not worth keeping . Samuel Tells Saul About His Sin
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then Samuel received this message from the Lord :
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ Saul has stopped following me , so I am sorry that I made him king . He is not doing what I tell him. ” Samuel became angry and cried to the Lord all night .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	12	Samuel got up early the next morning and went to meet Saul . But the people told Samuel , “ Saul went to Carmel . He went there to set up a stone monument to honor himself . Then he left there and went down to Gilgal. ” So Samuel went to Saul . Saul had just offered the first part of the things he took from the Amalekites as a burnt offering to the Lord . [ a ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	13	When Samuel came near to Saul , Saul greeted him and said , “ The Lord bless you ! I have obeyed the Lord ’ s commands. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	14	But Samuel said , “ Then what is that sound I hear ? Why do I hear sheep and cattle ? ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	16	Samuel said to Saul , “ Stop ! Let me tell you what the Lord told me last night. ” Saul answered , “ Tell me what he said. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	17	Samuel said , “ In the past you didn ’ t think that you were important , but the Lord chose you to be the king . So you became the leader of the tribes of Israel .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	18	The Lord sent you on a special mission . He said , ‘ Go and destroy all the Amalekites . They are evil people . Destroy them all ! Fight them until they are completely finished. ’
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	19	So why didn ’ t you listen to the Lord ? You did what the Lord said is wrong because you wanted to keep what you took in battle. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	20	Saul said , “ But I did obey the Lord ! I went where the Lord sent me . I destroyed all the Amalekites . I brought back only one—their king Agag .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	21	And the soldiers took the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God at Gilgal. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	22	But Samuel answered , “ Which pleases the Lord more : burnt offerings and sacrifices or obeying his commands ? It is better to obey the Lord than to offer sacrifices to him . It is better to listen to him than to offer the fat from rams .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	23	Refusing to obey is as bad as the sin of sorcery . Being stubborn and doing what you want is like the sin of worshiping idols . You refused to obey the Lord ’ s command , so he now refuses to accept you as king. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	24	Then Saul said to Samuel , “ I have sinned . I did not obey the Lord ’ s commands , and I did not do what you told me . I was afraid of the people , and I did what they said .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now I beg you , forgive me for doing this sin . Come back with me , so I may worship the Lord. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Samuel said to Saul , “ I won ’ t go back with you . You rejected the Lord ’ s command , and now the Lord rejects you as king of Israel. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	27	When Samuel turned to leave , Saul caught Samuel ’ s robe . The robe tore .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	28	Samuel said to Saul , “ In this same way the Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today . He has given the kingdom to one of your friends , a man who is a better person than you .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	29	The one who lives forever , the God of Israel , does not lie and will not change his mind . He is not like a man who is always changing his mind. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	30	Saul answered , “ All right , I sinned ! But please come back with me . Show me some respect in front of the leaders and the Israelites . Come back with me so that I may worship the Lord your God. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	31	Samuel went back with Saul , and Saul worshiped the Lord .
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	32	Samuel said , “ Bring King Agag of the Amalekites to me. ” Agag came to Samuel . Agag was tied with chains and thought , “ Surely he won ’ t kill me. ” [ b ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	15	33	But Samuel said to Agag , “ Your sword took babies from their mothers . So now , your mother will have no children. ” And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the Lord at Gilgal .

ERV	1%20Samuel	16	12	Jesse sent someone to get his youngest son . This son was a good-looking , healthy [ b ] young man . He was very handsome . The Lord said to Samuel , “ Get up and anoint him . He is the one. ”

It doesn ’ t matter how important it is , my father always tells me . Why would my father refuse to tell me that he wants to kill you ? No , it is not true ! ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	20	3	But David answered , “ Your father knows very well that I am your friend . Your father said to himself , ‘ Jonathan must not know about it . If he knows , he will tell David. ’ [ a ] But as surely as you and the Lord are alive , I am very close to death. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	20	4	Jonathan said to David , “ I will do anything you want me to do. ”

ERV	1%20Samuel	20	28	Jonathan answered , “ David asked me to let him go to Bethlehem .
ERV	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , ‘ Let me go . Our family is having a sacrifice in Bethlehem . My brother ordered me to be there . Now if I am your friend , please let me go and see my brothers. ’ That is why David has not come to the king ’ s table. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	20	30	Saul was very angry with Jonathan and said to him , “ You son of a twisted , rebellious woman ! I know that you have chosen to support that son of Jesse . [ d ] This will bring shame to you and to your mother .

ERV	1%20Samuel	21	12	David paid close attention to what they said . He was afraid of King Achish of Gath ,
ERV	1%20Samuel	21	13	so he pretended to be crazy in front of Achish and his officers . While David was with them , he acted like a crazy man . He spat on the doors of the gate . He let spit fall down his beard .
ERV	1%20Samuel	21	14	Achish said to his officers , “ Look at the man ! He is crazy . Why did you bring him to me ?
ERV	1%20Samuel	21	15	I have enough crazy men . I don ’ t need you to bring this man to my house to act crazy in front of me . Don ’ t let this man come into my house again. ” Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Samuel	22	22	Then David told Abiathar , “ I saw Doeg the Edomite at Nob that day . I knew he would tell Saul ! I am responsible for the death of your father ’ s family .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	2	Many people joined David . There were men who were in some kind of trouble , men who owed a lot of money , and men who were just not satisfied with life . All kinds of people joined David , and he became their leader . He had about
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	400	men with him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	3	David left Adullam and went to Mizpah in Moab . David said to the king of Moab , “ Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God is going to do to me. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	4	So David left his parents with the king of Moab . They stayed with the king of Moab as long as David was at the fort .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	5	But the prophet Gad said to David , “ Don ’ t stay in the fort . Go to the land of Judah. ” So David left and went to Hereth Forest . Saul Destroys Ahimelech ’ s Family
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	6	Saul heard the report about David and his men while sitting under the tree on the hill at Gibeah . Saul had his spear in his hand . All of his officers were standing around him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	7	Saul said to his officers who were standing around him , “ Listen , men of Benjamin . Do you think that son of Jesse [ b ] will give you fields and vineyards ? He is not one of us , so don ’ t think he will give you anything or make you officers over
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	1000	or even
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	100	men !
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	8	No , but all of you are plotting against me . None of you told me about my son Jonathan and the agreement he made with the son of Jesse . None of you cares enough about me to tell me that my own son Jonathan encouraged David to turn against me and attack me . And that is what David is doing now. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	9	Doeg the Edomite was standing there with Saul ’ s officers . Doeg said , “ I saw Jesse ’ s son at Nob . David came to see Ahimelech son of Ahitub .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	10	Ahimelech prayed to the Lord for David and gave him some food . He even gave David the sword of Goliath the Philistine. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then King Saul ordered some men to bring the priest to him . Saul told them to bring Ahimelech son of Ahitub and all his relatives who were priests at Nob . So all of them came to the king .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	12	Saul said to Ahimelech , “ Listen now , son of Ahitub. ” Ahimelech answered , “ Yes , sir. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	13	Saul said to him , “ Why did you and Jesse ’ s son make secret plans against me ? You gave David bread and a sword . You prayed to God for him . And right now , David is waiting to attack me. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	14	Ahimelech answered , “ David is very faithful to you . Not one of your other officers is as faithful as David . He is your own son-in-law and the captain of your bodyguards . Your own family respects David .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	15	That was not the first time I prayed to God for David . Not at all ! Don ’ t blame me or any of my relatives . We are your servants . I know nothing about what is happening. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	16	But the king said , “ Ahimelech , you and all your relatives must die. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	17	Then the king told the guards at his side , “ Go and kill the priests of the Lord because they are on David ’ s side too . They knew he was running away , but they didn ’ t tell me. ” The king ’ s officers refused to hurt the priests of the Lord .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	18	So the king gave the order to Doeg . Saul said , “ Doeg , you go kill the priests. ” So Doeg the Edomite went and killed the priests . That day he killed
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	85	men who were priests . [ c ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	19	Nob was the city of the priests . Doeg killed all the people of Nob . He used his sword and killed men , women , children and small babies . He even killed their cattle , donkeys , and sheep .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	20	But Abiathar son of Ahimelech escaped . He ran away and joined David .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	21	Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the Lord ’ s priests .
ERV	1%20Samuel	22	23	Stay with me . Don ’ t be afraid , because the man who tried to kill you is the same man who wants to kill me . I will protect you if you stay with me. ” Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Samuel	23	2	David asked the Lord , “ Should I go and fight these Philistines ? ” The Lord answered David , “ Yes , go attack the Philistines . Save Keilah. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said to him , “ Look , our men are afraid here in Judah . Just think how afraid we will be if we go to Keilah , where the Philistine army is lined up and ready for battle. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	4	David again asked the Lord . And the Lord answered David , “ Go down to Keilah . I will help you defeat the Philistines. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	5	So David and his men went to Keilah . David ’ s men fought the Philistines . They defeated them and took their cattle . In this way David saved the people of Keilah .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	6	( When Abiathar ran away to David , Abiathar took an ephod with him . [ a ] )
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	7	People told Saul that David was now at Keilah . Saul said , “ God has given David to me . David trapped himself when he went into a city surrounded by a wall with gates and bars to lock them. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	8	Saul called all his army together for battle . They prepared to go down to Keilah to attack David and his men .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	9	David learned that Saul was making plans against him . David then said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring the ephod. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	10	David prayed , “ Lord , God of Israel , I have heard that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town because of me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will Saul come to Keilah ? Will the people of Keilah give me to Saul ? Lord , God of Israel , I am your servant . Please tell me ! ” The Lord answered , “ Saul will come. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	12	Again David asked , “ Will the people of Keilah give me and my men to Saul ? ” The Lord answered , “ They will. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his men left Keilah . There were about
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	600	men who went with David . They kept moving from place to place . Saul learned that David had escaped from Keilah , so he did not go to that city . Saul Chases David
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	14	David went into the desert of Ziph and stayed in the mountains and fortresses there . Saul looked for David the whole time , but the Lord [ b ] didn ’ t let Saul catch him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	15	David was at Horesh in the desert of Ziph . He was afraid because Saul was coming to kill him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	16	But Saul ’ s son Jonathan went to see David at Horesh and encouraged him to have a stronger faith in God .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	17	Jonathan told David , “ Don ’ t be afraid . My father Saul won ’ t hurt you . You will become the king of Israel , and I will be second to you . Even my father knows this. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	18	Jonathan and David both made an agreement before the Lord . Then Jonathan went home , and David stayed at Horesh . The People of Ziph Tell Saul About David
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	19	Some people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and told him , “ David is hiding in our area . He is at the fortresses of Horesh on Hakilah Hill , south of Jeshimon .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	20	Now , King , come down any time you want . It is our duty to give David to you. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	21	Saul answered , “ May the Lord bless you for helping me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go and learn more about David . Keep track of where he goes and who goes to see him . I am told that David is smart and that he is trying to trick me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	24	So those people went back to Ziph before Saul . David and his men were in the desert of Maon , south of Jeshimon .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	25	Saul and his men went to look for David , but the people warned him . They told David that Saul was looking for him . So David then went down to “ The Rock ” in the desert of Maon . Saul heard that David had gone there , so Saul went to that place to find him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul was on one side of the mountain . David and his men were on the other side of the same mountain . David was moving as quickly as possible to get away from Saul . But Saul and his soldiers were going around the mountain to cut them off and trap David and his men .
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	27	Then a messenger arrived and told Saul , “ Come quickly ! The Philistines are attacking. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	28	So Saul stopped chasing David and went to fight the Philistines . That is why people call this place “ Slippery Rock. ” [ c ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	23	29	David left the desert of Maon and went to the fortresses near En Gedi . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel 24:6 chosen king Literally , “ anointed one. ” Also in verse
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	24	After Saul had chased the Philistines away , people told him , “ David is in the desert area near En Gedi. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	2	So Saul chose
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	3000	men from all over Israel and began searching for David and his men . They looked near Wild Goat Rocks .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	3	Saul came to some sheep pens beside the road . There was a cave near there , so Saul went in to relieve himself . David and his men were deep inside that same cave .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	4	David ’ s men told him , “ This is day the Lord told you about when he said , ‘ I will give your enemy to you , and you can do whatever you want to him. ’ ” So David crawled closer and closer to Saul and cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe . Saul didn ’ t notice what happened .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	5	Later , David felt bad about what he did .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	6	He said to his men , “ I pray the Lord never lets me do anything like that to my master again . I must not do anything against Saul , because he is the Lord ’ s chosen king . [ a ] ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	7	David said these things to stop his men . He would not let his men hurt Saul . Saul left the cave and went on his way .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	8	Later , David came out of the cave and called out to Saul , “ My lord the king ! ” Saul looked back . David bowed with his face to the ground to show his respect .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	9	David said to Saul , “ Why do you listen when people say , ‘ David plans to hurt you ’ ?
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	10	.
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	11	Look at this piece of cloth in my hand . I cut off the corner of your robe . I could have killed you , but I didn ’ t . Now , I want you to understand this . I want you to know that I am not planning anything against you . I did nothing wrong to you , but you are hunting me and trying to kill me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	12	Let the Lord be the judge . I hope the Lord will punish you for the wrong you did to me , but I won ’ t fight you myself .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	13	There is an old saying : ‘ Bad things come from bad people. ’ “ I haven ’ t done anything bad , and I won ’ t hurt you .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	14	Who are you chasing ? Did the king of Israel bring an army to chase a single flea or a dying dog ?
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	15	Let the Lord be the judge . Let him decide between you and me . He will support me and show that I am right . He will save me from you. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	16	When David finished speaking , Saul asked , “ Is that your voice , David my son ? ” Then Saul lifted his voice and began to cry .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	17	He said , “ You are right , and I am wrong . You were good to me , even though I have been bad to you .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	18	You yourself said it when you told me about the good things you did . The Lord put my life in your hands , but you did not kill me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	19	This shows that you are not my enemy . A man doesn ’ t catch his enemy , and then just let him go . He doesn ’ t do good things for his enemy . May the Lord reward you for being good to me today .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	20	Now , I know that you will become the new king . You will rule the kingdom of Israel .
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	21	Now make a promise to me with an oath using the Lord ’ s name . Promise that you will not kill my descendants , even after I die . Promise me that you will not erase my name from my father ’ s family. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	24	22	So David made a promise to Saul . He promised that he would not kill Saul ’ s family . Then Saul went back home . David and his men went back up to the fort . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Samuel	25	9	David ’ s men went to Nabal . They gave his message to Nabal ,
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	10	but Nabal said , “ Who is David ? Who is this son of Jesse ? There are many slaves who have run away from their masters these days .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	11	I have bread and water , and I have the meat I killed for my servants who cut the wool from my sheep . But I won ’ t give them to men I don ’ t even know. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	12	David ’ s men went back and told him everything that Nabal had said .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	13	David ’ s response was , “ Put on your swords. ” So David and his men put on their swords . About
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	400	men went with David while

ERV	1%20Samuel	25	14	One of Nabal ’ s servants spoke to Nabal ’ s wife Abigail . The servant said , “ David sent messengers from the desert to meet our master , but Nabal was rude to them .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	15	These men were very good to us while we were out in the fields with the sheep . David ’ s men were with us the whole time , and they never did anything wrong to us . They did not take anything from us .

ERV	1%20Samuel	25	17	Nabal was foolish to say what he did . Terrible trouble is coming to our master and all his family . You need to think of something to do. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	18	Abigail quickly gathered up
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	19	Then Abigail told her servants , “ Go on . I ’ ll follow you. ” But she did not tell her husband .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	20	Abigail rode her donkey down to the other side of the mountain . She met David and his men coming from the other direction .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	21	David was saying , “ I protected Nabal ’ s property in the desert . I made sure not one of his sheep was missing . I did all that for nothing . I was good to him , but he was rude to me .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	22	I swear , [ f ] I won ’ t let even one man in Nabal ’ s family live until tomorrow morning. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	23	Just then Abigail arrived . When she saw David , she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down with her face to the ground in front of him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	24	Abigail fell at his feet and said , “ Sir , please let me talk to you . Listen to what I say . Blame me for what happened .

ERV	1%20Samuel	25	38	About ten days later , the Lord gave him a stroke and Nabal died .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	39	When David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , “ Praise the Lord ! He judged Nabal to be wrong for insulting me and kept me from doing something wrong . The Lord made Nabal pay for what he did. ” Then David sent a message to Abigail and asked her to be his wife .
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	40	His servants went to Carmel with this message , “ David sent us to get you . He wants you to be his wife. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	41	Abigail bowed her face to the ground . She said , “ I am willing to be your slave woman , even if it is only to wash the feet of my master ’ s servants. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	25	42	Abigail quickly got on a donkey and brought five of her maids with her . They followed David ’ s messengers . So Abigail became David ’ s wife .

ERV	1%20Samuel	26	26	The people of Ziph went to see Saul at Gibeah and said to him , “ David is hiding on Hakilah Hill , across from Jeshimon. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	2	Saul gathered
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	3000	of the best soldiers in Israel and went down to the desert of Ziph to search for David there .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	3	Saul set up his camp by the road at Hakilah Hill , across from Jeshimon . David was out in the desert and saw that Saul had come out into the desert after him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	4	So David sent out spies to know for certain that Saul had come after him again .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	5	Then David went to where Saul had set up his camp . David saw where Saul and Abner were sleeping . ( Abner son of Ner was the commander of Saul ’ s army . ) Saul was sleeping in the center of a circle of men that surrounded him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	6	David talked to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah . ( Abishai was Joab ’ s brother . ) He asked them , “ Who would like to go down into the camp with me after Saul ? ” Abishai answered , “ I ’ ll go with you. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	7	When night came , David and Abishai went into Saul ’ s camp . Saul was asleep in the middle of the circle of men . His spear was stuck in the ground near his head . Abner and the other soldiers were asleep around Saul .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	8	Abishai said to David , “ Today God has given your enemy to you . Let me pin Saul to the ground with his spear . I ’ ll only do it once ! ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , “ Don ’ t kill Saul ! Anyone who hurts the Lord ’ s chosen king [ a ] must be punished .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	10	As surely as the Lord lives , the Lord himself will punish Saul . Maybe Saul will die naturally or maybe he will be killed in battle .

ERV	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and water jug that were near Saul ’ s head , and then David and Abishai left Saul ’ s camp . No one knew what had happened . No one saw it . No one even woke up . Saul and all of his soldiers slept because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep . David Shames Saul Again
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	13	David crossed over to the other side of the valley . He stood on top of the mountain across the valley from Saul ’ s camp . David and Saul ’ s camp were far apart .

ERV	1%20Samuel	26	15	David said , “ You are an important man , aren ’ t you ? You are better than any other man in Israel . Is that right ? So why didn ’ t you guard your master , the king ? An ordinary man came into your camp to kill your master , the king .
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	16	,
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul knew David ’ s voice and said , “ Is that your voice , David my son ? ” David answered , “ Yes , it is my voice , my lord the king .

ERV	1%20Samuel	26	19	My lord the king , listen to me . If the Lord caused you to be angry with me , let him accept an offering .

ERV	1%20Samuel	26	20	Now don ’ t make me die far away from the Lord ’ s presence . The king of Israel has come out looking for a flea . You are like a man hunting partridges in the mountains. ” [ b ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , “ David , my son ! I have sinned . Come back . Today you showed me that my life is important to you , so I won ’ t try to hurt you . I have acted foolishly . I have made a big mistake. ”

ERV	1%20Samuel	27	4	People told Saul that David had run away to Gath , so Saul stopped looking for him .
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	5	David said to Achish , “ If you are pleased with me , give me a place in one of the country towns . I am only your servant . I should live there , not here with you in this royal city. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	6	That day Achish gave David the town of Ziklag . And Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since .
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	7	David lived with the Philistines one year and four months . David Fools King Achish
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	8	David and his men went to fight the Amalekites and Geshurites who lived in the area from Telem [ a ] near Shur all the way to Egypt . David ’ s men defeated them and took their wealth .
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	9	David defeated the people in that area . He took all their sheep , cattle , donkeys , camels , and clothes and brought them back to Achish . But David didn ’ t let any of those people live .
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	10	David did this many times . Each time Achish asked David where he fought and took those things . David said , “ I fought against the southern part of Judah , ” or “ I fought against the southern part of Jerahmeel , ” or “ I fought against the southern part of the Kenizzites. ” [ b ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	11	David never brought a man or woman alive to Gath . He thought , “ If we let anyone live , they might tell Achish what I really did. ” David did this all the time he lived in the Philistine land .
ERV	1%20Samuel	27	12	Achish began to trust David and said to himself , “ Now David ’ s own people hate him . The Israelites hate him very much . Now he will serve me forever. ” Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Samuel	28	2	David answered , “ Certainly , then you can see for yourself what I can do. ” Achish said , “ Fine , I will make you my permanent bodyguard. ” Saul and the Woman at Endor
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	3	After Samuel died , all the Israelites mourned for him and buried him in Ramah , his hometown . Saul had removed the mediums and fortunetellers from Israel .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines prepared for war . They came to Shunem and made their camp at that place . Saul gathered all the Israelites together and made his camp at Gilboa .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	5	Saul saw the Philistine army , and he was afraid . His heart pounded with fear .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	6	He prayed to the Lord , but the Lord did not answer him . God did not talk to Saul in dreams . God did not use the Urim to give him an answer , and God did not use prophets to speak to Saul .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	7	Finally , Saul said to his officers , “ Find me a woman who is a medium . Then I can go ask her what will happen. ” His officers answered , “ There is a medium at Endor . [ a ] ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	8	That night , Saul put on different clothes so that no one would know who he was . Then Saul and two of his men went to see the woman . Saul said to her , “ I want you to bring up a ghost who can tell me what will happen in the future . You must call for the ghost of the person I name. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	9	But the woman said to him , “ You know that Saul forced all the mediums and fortunetellers to leave the land of Israel . You are trying to trap me and kill me. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	10	Saul used the Lord ’ s name to make a promise to the woman . He said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , you won ’ t be punished for doing this. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	11	The woman asked , “ Who do you want me to bring up for you ? ” Saul answered , “ Bring up Samuel. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	12	And it happened—the woman saw Samuel and screamed . She said to Saul , “ You tricked me ! You are Saul. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	13	The king said to the woman , “ Don ’ t be afraid ! What do you see ? ” The woman said , “ I see a spirit coming up out of the ground . [ b ] ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	14	Saul asked , “ What does he look like ? ” The woman answered , “ He looks like an old man wearing a special robe. ” Then Saul knew it was Samuel , and he bowed down . His face touched the ground .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	15	Samuel said to Saul , “ Why did you bother me ? Why did you bring me up ? ” Saul answered , “ I am in trouble ! The Philistines have come to fight me , and God has left me . God won ’ t answer me anymore . He won ’ t use prophets or dreams to answer me , so I called you . I want you to tell me what to do. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	16	Samuel said , “ The Lord left you and is now your enemy , so why are you asking me for advice ?
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	17	The Lord used me to tell you what he would do , and now he is doing what he said he would do . He is tearing the kingdom out of your hands and giving it to your neighbor , David .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	18	The Lord was angry with the Amalekites and told you to destroy them . But you did not obey him . That ’ s why the Lord is doing this to you today .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	19	The Lord will let the Philistines defeat you and the army of Israel today . Tomorrow , you and your sons will be here with me. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	20	Saul quickly fell to the ground and lay stretched out there . Saul was afraid because of what Samuel said . Saul was also very weak because he had not eaten any food all that day and night .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	21	The woman came over to Saul and saw how afraid he was . She said , “ Look , I am your servant . I have obeyed you . I risked my life and did what you told me to do .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	22	Please , listen to me . You need to eat . Let me get you some food . Then you will have enough strength to go on your way. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	23	But Saul refused . He said , “ I won ’ t eat. ” Saul ’ s officers joined the woman and begged him to eat . Finally , Saul listened to them . He got up from the ground and sat on the bed .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	24	The woman had a calf that she had been fattening . She quickly killed the calf . She took some flour and pressed it with her hands . Then she baked some bread without yeast .
ERV	1%20Samuel	28	25	The woman put the food before Saul and his officers and they ate . Then they got up and left during the night . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Samuel	29	3	The Philistine captains asked , “ What are these Hebrews doing here ? ” Achish told the Philistine captains , “ This is David . He was one of Saul ’ s officers , but he has been with me for a long time . I found nothing wrong in David since the time he left Saul and came to me. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the Philistine captains were angry with Achish . They said , “ Send him back . Let him go back to the city you gave him , but he can ’ t go into battle with us . As long as he is here , we have an enemy in our own camp . He would make his king happy by killing our men .
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	5	Isn ’ t David the one the Israelites sing about ? They dance and sing this song : ‘ Saul has killed thousands of enemies , but David has killed tens of thousands. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Achish called David and said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , you are loyal to me . I would be pleased to have you serve in my army . I haven ’ t found anything wrong with you since the day you came to me . The Philistine rulers also think you are a good man . [ a ]
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	7	Go back in peace . Don ’ t do anything against the Philistine rulers. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	8	David asked , “ What have I done wrong ? Have you found anything wrong with me since the day I came to you ? So why won ’ t you let me go to fight the enemies of my lord the king ? ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	9	Achish answered , “ I believe that you are a good man . You are like an angel from God . But the Philistine captains still say , ‘ David can ’ t go with us into battle. ’
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	10	Early in the morning , you and your men should go back to the city I gave you . Don ’ t pay attention to the bad things the captains say about you . You are a good man , but you must leave as soon as there is enough light in the morning. ”
ERV	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David and his men got up early in the morning and went back to the country of the Philistines , and the Philistines went up to Jezreel . Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Samuel	15	20	You came to join me only yesterday . You don ’ t need to wander from place to place with me . Take your brothers and go back . Go with my faithful , loving kindness. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	21	But Ittai answered the king , “ As the Lord lives , and as long as you live , I will stay with you , in life or death ! ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	22	David said to Ittai , “ Then come , let ’ s go cross Kidron Brook. ” So Ittai from Gath and all of his people and their children crossed over Kidron Brook .
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	23	All the people [ c ] were crying loudly . Then King David crossed over Kidron Brook , and all the people went out to the desert .

ERV	2%20Samuel	15	31	Someone told David , “ Ahithophel is one who joined in Absalom ’ s plot against you. ” Then David prayed , “ Lord , I ask you to make Ahithophel give only foolish advice. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	32	When David got to the top of the mountain , he bowed down to worship God . Then David noticed Hushai the Arkite . Hushai ’ s coat was torn , and there was dust on his head . [ f ]
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	33	David said to Hushai , “ If you go with me , you will be just one more person to care for .
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	34	But if you go back to Jerusalem , you can disagree with Ahithophel and make his advice useless . Tell Absalom , ‘ King , I am your servant . I served your father , but now I will serve you. ’
ERV	2%20Samuel	15	35	The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you . You must tell them everything you hear in the king ’ s palace .

ERV	2%20Samuel	16	5	As David came to Bahurim , a man from Saul ’ s family , Shimei son of Gera , came out cursing David again and again .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	6	Shimei began throwing stones at David and his officers . Both the people and the soldiers gathered around David to protect him—they were all around him .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	7	Shimei cursed David . He said , “ Get out , get out , you no-good murderer [ b ] !
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	8	The Lord is punishing you because you killed people in Saul ’ s family . You stole Saul ’ s place as king . But now the same bad things are happening to you . The Lord has given the kingdom to your son Absalom , because you are a murderer. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	9	Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king , “ Why should this dying dog curse you , my lord the king ? Let me go over and cut off Shimei ’ s head. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	10	But the king answered , “ What can I do , sons of Zeruiah ? Yes , Shimei is cursing me , but the Lord told him to curse me . And who can ask him why he did that ? ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	11	David also said to Abishai and all his servants , “ Look , my very own son is trying to kill me , so why shouldn ’ t this man from the tribe of Benjamin want to do the same ? Leave him alone . Let him continue to curse me . The Lord told him to do this .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	12	Maybe the Lord will see the wrong things that are happening to me and give me something good for every bad thing that Shimei says today. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men went on their way down the road . Shimei kept following David . He walked on the other side of the road by the side of the hill . He kept cursing David on his way . Shimei also threw stones and dirt at David .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	14	King David and all his people came to the Jordan River . They were tired , so they rested and refreshed themselves there .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	15	Meanwhile , Absalom , Ahithophel , and all the Israelites came to Jerusalem .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	17	Absalom answered , “ Why are you not loyal to your friend David ? Why did you not leave Jerusalem with your friend ? ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	18	Hushai said , “ I belong to the one that the Lord chooses . These people and the people of Israel chose you . I will stay with you .

ERV	2%20Samuel	16	20	Absalom said to Ahithophel , “ Please tell us what we should do. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	21	Ahithophel said to Absalom , “ Your father left some of his slave women here to take care of the house . Go and have sexual relations with them . Then all the Israelites will hear how you humiliated your father , and they will be encouraged to give you more support. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	22	Then they put up a tent for Absalom up on the roof of the house . Absalom had sexual relations with his father ’ s wives [ c ] so that all the Israelites could see what happened .
ERV	2%20Samuel	16	23	So in those days Ahithophel ’ s advice was very important . Both David and Absalom accepted his advice as though it were the word of God . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	2	Samuel 17:25 His mother … Zeruiah Literally , “ Ithra had sexual relations with Abigail , the daughter of Nahash sister of Zeruiah . ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	17	The priests ’ sons , Jonathan and Ahimaaz , did not want to be seen going into the town , so they waited at En Rogel . A servant girl went out to them and gave them the message . Then Jonathan and Ahimaaz carried the message to King David .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	3	Then I will bring all the people back to you . If David is dead , all the people will come back in peace. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	4	This plan seemed good to Absalom and all the leaders of Israel .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	5	But Absalom said , “ Now call Hushai the Arkite . I also want to hear what he says. ” Hushai Ruins Ahithophel ’ s Advice
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	6	Hushai came to Absalom . Absalom said to Hushai , “ This is the plan Ahithophel gave . Should we follow it ? If not , tell us. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	7	Hushai said to Absalom , “ Ahithophel ’ s advice is not good this time. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	8	Hushai added , “ You know that your father and his men are strong men . They are as dangerous as a wild bear when something has taken its cubs . Your father is a skilled fighter . He will not stay all night with the people .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	9	He is probably already hiding in a cave or some other place . If your father attacks your men first , people will hear the news and think , ‘ Absalom ’ s followers are losing ! ’
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	10	Then even your bravest men will be frightened , because all the Israelites know that your father is a powerful soldier and that his men are very brave .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	11	“ This is what I suggest : You must gather all the Israelites together from Dan to Beersheba . [ a ] Then there will be many people , like the sand by the sea . Then you yourself must go into the battle .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	12	We will catch David wherever he is hiding and attack him with so many soldiers that they will be like the dew that covers the ground . We will kill David and all of his men—no one will be left alive .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	13	But if David escapes into a city , all the Israelites can bring ropes to that city and pull its walls down into the valley . Not even a small stone will be left in that city. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	14	Absalom and all the Israelites said , “ Hushai ’ s advice is better than Ahithophel ’ s. ” Actually , Ahithophel ’ s advice was good , but they said this because the Lord had decided to make Ahithophel ’ s advice useless . He did this to punish Absalom . Hushai Sends a Warning to David
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	15	Hushai told the priests , Zadok and Abiathar , what was said . He told them what Ahithophel suggested to Absalom and the leaders of Israel . Hushai also told them what he himself had suggested . He said ,
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	16	“ Send a message to David now ! Tell him not to spend the night at the places where people cross into the desert . Tell him to go across the Jordan River at once . If he crosses the river , the king and all his people will not be caught. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a boy saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and ran to tell Absalom . Jonathan and Ahimaaz ran away quickly . They arrived at a man ’ s house in Bahurim . The man had a well in his courtyard . [ b ] Jonathan and Ahimaaz went down into this well .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	19	The man ’ s wife spread a sheet over the mouth of the well and covered it with grain . The well looked like a pile of grain , so no one would know to look there .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	20	Absalom ’ s servants came to the woman at the house . They asked , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” The woman said to Absalom ’ s servants , “ They have already crossed over the brook. ” Absalom ’ s servants then went to look for Jonathan and Ahimaaz , but they could not find them . So Absalom ’ s servants went back to Jerusalem .
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	21	After Absalom ’ s servants left , Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well and went to King David . They said to David , “ Hurry , go across the river . Ahithophel is planning to do something to you. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	22	So David and his people crossed over the Jordan River . By sunrise , all of David ’ s people had crossed the Jordan River . No one was left behind . Ahithophel Kills Himself
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	23	When Ahithophel saw that the Israelites did not do what he suggested , he saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown . He made plans for his family and then hanged himself . They buried him in his father ’ s tomb . Absalom Crosses the Jordan River
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	24	David arrived at Mahanaim just as Absalom and the Israelites who were with him crossed over the Jordan River . 25-26 Absalom and the Israelites made their camp in the land of Gilead . Absalom had made Amasa the new captain of the army . He took Joab ’ s place . [ c ] Amasa was the son of Ithra the Ishmaelite . [ d ] His mother was Abigail , the daughter of Nahash , the sister of Joab ’ s mother , Zeruiah . [ e ] Shobi , Makir , and Barzillai
ERV	2%20Samuel	17	27	When David arrived at Mahanaim , Shobi , Makir , and Barzillai were there . Shobi son of Nahash was from the Ammonite town of Rabbah . Makir son of Ammiel was from Lo Debar . Barzillai was from Rogelim in Gilead . 28-29 These three men said , “ The people are tired , hungry , and thirsty from the desert. ” So they brought many things to David and those with him . They brought beds , bowls , and other kinds of dishes . They also brought wheat , barley , flour , roasted grain , beans , lentils , dried seeds , honey , butter , sheep , and cheese made from cow ’ s milk . Footnotes -

The branches were thick , and Absalom ’ s head got caught in the tree . His mule ran out from under him , so Absalom was left hanging above the ground . [ a ]
ERV	2%20Samuel	18	10	Someone saw this happen and told Joab , “ I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree. ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	18	11	Joab said to the man , “ Why didn ’ t you kill him and let him fall to the ground ? I would have given you a belt and ten pieces of silver ! ”
ERV	2%20Samuel	18	12	The man said to Joab , “ I would not try to hurt the king ’ s son even if you gave me

ERV	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia , “ Go , tell the king what you have seen. ” So the Ethiopian bowed to Joab and ran to tell David .
ERV	2%20Samuel	18	22	But Ahimaaz son of Zadok begged Joab again , “ No matter what happens , please let me also run after the Ethiopian ! ” Joab said , “ Son , why do you want to carry the news ? You will not get any reward for the news you bring. ”

ERV	1%20Kings	1	3	So the king ’ s servants began looking everywhere in the country of Israel for a beautiful young woman to keep the king warm . They found a young woman named Abishag , from the town of Shunem , and brought her to the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	4	She was very beautiful . She cared for the king and served him , but King David did not have sexual relations with her . 5-6 Adonijah was the son of King David and his wife Haggith . He was born after Absalom . Adonijah was a very handsome man . King David never corrected his son Adonijah , and he never made him explain his actions . Adonijah became very proud and decided that he would be the next king . He wanted very much to be the king , so he got himself a chariot , horses , and
ERV	1%20Kings	1	50	Adonijah was also afraid of Solomon , so he went to the altar and held onto the horns of the altar .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	7	Adonijah talked with Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest . They decided to help make him the new king ,
ERV	1%20Kings	1	8	but several important men did not join Adonijah . They were Zadok the priest , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , Nathan the prophet , Shimei , Rei , and King David ’ s special guard . [ a ]
ERV	1%20Kings	1	9	One day , at Zoheleth Rock near En Rogel , [ b ] Adonijah sacrificed some sheep , cattle , and fat calves as a fellowship offering . He invited his brothers ( the other sons of King David ) and all the officers from Judah .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	10	But he did not invite his brother Solomon , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah , or the men in the king ’ s special guard . Nathan Advises Bathsheba
ERV	1%20Kings	1	11	When Nathan heard about this , he went to Solomon ’ s mother Bathsheba and asked her , “ Have you heard what Haggith ’ s son , Adonijah , is doing ? He is making himself king . And our master , King David , knows nothing about it .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	12	You and your son Solomon are in danger , but I will tell you what to do to save yourself .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	13	Go to King David and tell him , ‘ My lord and king , you promised me that my son Solomon would be the next king after you . So why is Adonijah becoming the new king ? ’
ERV	1%20Kings	1	14	Then while you are still talking with him , I will come in . After you leave I will tell the king what has happened . This will show that what you said is true. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went in to see the king in his bedroom . The king was very old . Abishag , the girl from Shunem , was caring for him there .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed down before the king . The king asked , “ What can I do for you ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	17	Bathsheba answered , “ Sir , you used the name of the Lord your God and made a promise to me . You said , ‘ Your son Solomon will be the next king after me . He will sit on my throne. ’
ERV	1%20Kings	1	18	Now , you don ’ t know this , but Adonijah is making himself king .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	19	He is giving a big fellowship meal . He has killed many cattle and the best sheep , and he has invited all of your sons to the meal . He also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab , the commander of your army , but he did not invite your faithful son Solomon .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	20	Now , my lord and king , all the Israelites are watching you . They are waiting for you to decide who will be the next king after you .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	21	If you don ’ t decide , then after you are buried , these men will say that Solomon and I are criminals. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	22	While Bathsheba was still talking with the king , Nathan the prophet came to see him .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	23	The servants told the king , “ Nathan the prophet is here. ” Nathan went in to speak to the king . He bowed down before the king
ERV	1%20Kings	1	24	and said , “ My lord and king , did you announce that Adonijah will be the new king after you ? Have you decided that he will rule the people now ?
ERV	1%20Kings	1	25	Today he went down into the valley to offer many cattle and the best sheep as fellowship offerings . He invited all your other sons , the commanders of the army , and Abiathar the priest . They are now eating and drinking with him . And they are saying , ‘ Long live King Adonijah ! ’
ERV	1%20Kings	1	26	But he did not invite me , or Zadok the priest , or Benaiah son of Jehoiada , or your son Solomon .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	27	My lord and king , did you do this without telling us ? Please tell us , who will be the next king after you ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	28	Then King David said , “ Tell Bathsheba to come in ! ” So she came in and stood before the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	29	Then the king made a promise : “ The Lord has saved me from every danger . As surely as he lives , I make this promise to you .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	30	Today I will do what I promised you in the past . I made that promise by the power of the Lord , the God of Israel . I promised that your son Solomon would be the next king after me . I promised that he would take my place on my throne , and I will keep my promise ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed down before the king and said , “ Long live King David ! ” Solomon Is Anointed King
ERV	1%20Kings	1	32	Then King David said , “ Tell Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah son of Jehoiada to come in here. ” So the three men came in to meet with the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	33	Then the king said to them , “ Take my officers with you . Put my son Solomon on my mule and take him to Gihon Spring . [ c ]
ERV	1%20Kings	1	34	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet will anoint him to be the new king of Israel . Blow the trumpet and announce , ‘ This is the new king , Solomon ! ’
ERV	1%20Kings	1	35	Then come back here with him . Solomon will sit on my throne and be the new king in my place . I have chosen him to be the ruler of Israel and Judah. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king , “ Amen ! It is as true as if the Lord God himself had said it , my lord and king .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	37	My lord and king , the Lord has been with you , and now I pray that he will be with Solomon ! And I pray that King Solomon ’ s kingdom will grow and be even more powerful than yours , my lord and king. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok , Nathan , Benaiah , and the king ’ s officers obeyed King David . They put Solomon on David ’ s mule and went with him down to Gihon Spring .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	39	Zadok the priest carried the oil from the Holy Tent and poured it on Solomon ’ s head to show that he was the new king . They blew the trumpet and all the people shouted , “ Long live King Solomon ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	40	Then all the people followed Solomon back into the city . They were very happy and excited . They were playing flutes and making so much noise that the ground shook .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	41	Meanwhile , Adonijah and his guests were just finishing their meal . They heard the sound of the trumpet , and Joab asked , “ What is that noise ? What is happening in the city ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	42	While Joab was still speaking , Jonathan , son of Abiathar the priest , arrived . Adonijah said , “ Come here ! You are a good man , [ d ] so you must be bringing good news. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	43	But Jonathan answered , “ No , it is not good news for you ! King David has made Solomon the new king .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	44	King David sent Zadok the priest , Nathan the prophet , Benaiah son of Jehoiada , and all the king ’ s officers with Solomon out to Gihon Spring . They put Solomon on the king ’ s mule .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	45	Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed Solomon at Gihon Spring and then went back into the city . The people followed them , and now everyone in the city is celebrating . That is the noise you hear . 46-47 Solomon is sitting on the king ’ s throne and the king ’ s officers are congratulating King David , saying , ‘ King David , you are a great king ! ’ And now we pray that your God will make Solomon a great king too . We pray your God will make him even more famous than you . And we pray that his kingdom will be even greater than yours is ! Even King David was there . From his bed , the king bowed before Solomon
ERV	1%20Kings	1	48	and said , ‘ Praise the Lord , the God of Israel . He has put one of my own sons on my throne , and he has let me live to see it. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	49	All of Adonijah ’ s guests were afraid and left very quickly .
ERV	1%20Kings	1	51	Then someone told Solomon , “ Adonijah is afraid of you , King Solomon . He is at the Holy Tent holding onto the horns of the altar , and he refuses to leave . Adonijah says , ‘ Tell King Solomon to promise that he will not kill me. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	52	So Solomon answered , “ If Adonijah shows that he is a good man , I promise that not a hair on his head will be hurt . But if he does anything wrong , he will die. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	1	53	Then King Solomon sent some men to get Adonijah and brought him in . He approached the king and bowed before him . Then Solomon said , “ Go home. ” Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Kings	2	1	Sam . 2:27-36 .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	2	“ I am about to die , like all men must . But you are growing stronger and becoming a man .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	3	Now , carefully obey all the commands of the Lord your God . Carefully obey all his laws , commands , decisions , and agreements . Obey everything that is written in the Law of Moses . If you do this , you will be successful at whatever you do and wherever you go .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	4	And if you obey the Lord , he will keep his promise about me . He said , ‘ If your sons carefully live the way I tell them , sincerely , with all their heart , the king of Israel will always be a man from your family. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	5	David also said , “ You remember what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me . He killed two of the commanders of Israel ’ s army , Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether . Remember , it was during a time of peace when he spilled the blood that splattered onto his sword belt and army boots . I should have punished him then .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	6	Use your wisdom , but don ’ t let him die peacefully of old age .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	7	“ Also , be kind to the children of Barzillai from Gilead . Be friends with them , and let them eat at your table , because they helped me when I ran away from your brother Absalom .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	8	“ And remember , Shimei son of Gera is still around . He is the Benjamite from Bahurim who cursed me when I ran away to Mahanaim . But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan River , I made a promise to him before the Lord that I would not kill him .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	9	Now , don ’ t leave him unpunished . You are a wise man . You will know what you must do , but don ’ t let him die peacefully of old age. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	10	Then David died and was buried in the City of David .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	11	David ruled Israel
ERV	1%20Kings	2	40	so he saddled his donkey and went to King Achish at Gath to find them . He found them there and brought them back home .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	33	He and his family will always be guilty for their deaths . But the Lord will bring peace to David , his descendants , his family of kings , and his kingdom forever. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	12	Now Solomon was king . He sat on the throne of his father David and was in complete control of his kingdom .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	13	One day Adonijah , the son of Haggith , went to Solomon ’ s mother , Bathsheba . She asked him , “ Do you come in peace ? ” Adonijah answered , “ Yes , this is a peaceful visit .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	14	I have something to ask you. ” Bathsheba said , “ Then speak. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	15	Adonijah said , “ You know that at one time the kingdom was mine . All the people of Israel wanted me to be their king . But things have changed , and now my brother is the king . The Lord chose him to be king .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	16	But now I have one thing to ask you . Please don ’ t refuse me. ” Bathsheba answered , “ What do you want ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	17	Adonijah said , “ I know that King Solomon will do whatever you ask . So please ask him to let me marry Abishag , the woman from Shunem. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	18	Then Bathsheba said , “ Very well , I will speak to the king for you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk with him . When the king saw her , he stood up , bowed before her , and then sat back down . He told some servants to bring another throne for his mother , and she sat down at his right side .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	20	Bathsheba said to him , “ I have one small thing to ask you . Please don ’ t refuse me. ” The king answered , “ Ask whatever you want , mother . I will not refuse you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	21	So Bathsheba said , “ Let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag , the woman from Shunem. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother , “ Why are you asking me to give Abishag to Adonijah ? Why don ’ t you just ask me to give him the whole kingdom ! After all , he is my older brother , and both Abiathar the priest and Joab support him ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	23	Then Solomon said , “ By the Lord , I swear I ’ ll make Adonijah pay for this with his life !
ERV	1%20Kings	2	24	The Lord made me the king of Israel . He gave me the throne of my father David . The Lord kept his promise and gave the kingdom to me and my family . Now , as surely as the Lord lives , I swear Adonijah will die today ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	25	King Solomon gave the command to Benaiah , and Benaiah went out and killed Adonijah .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	26	Then King Solomon said to Abiathar the priest , “ I should kill you , but I will let you go back to your home in Anathoth . I will not kill you now because you helped carry the Holy Box of the Lord God while marching with my father David . And I know that you shared in the hard times with my father. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon told Abiathar that he could not continue to serve as a priest of the Lord . This happened as the Lord said it would when he told Eli the priest what would happen to him and his family . [ a ]
ERV	1%20Kings	2	28	Joab had supported Adonijah , but not Absalom . But when Joab heard what happened to Abiathar , he was frightened and ran to the tent of the Lord to hold onto the horns of the altar .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	29	Someone told King Solomon that Joab was at the altar in the Lord ’ s Tent . So Solomon ordered Benaiah to go and kill him .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	30	Benaiah went into the Lord ’ s Tent and said to Joab , “ The king says , ‘ Come out ! ’ ” But Joab answered , “ No , I will die here. ” Benaiah went back to the king and told him what Joab had said .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	31	The king commanded Benaiah , “ Do as he says ! Kill him there and take him out to bury him . Then my family and I will be free of Joab ’ s guilt from killing innocent people .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	32	Joab killed two men who were much better than he was . He killed Abner son of Ner , the commander of the army of Israel , and Amasa son of Jether , the commander of the army of Judah . He did this without my father ’ s knowledge . But now the Lord will punish Joab for the men he killed .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada killed Joab , and he was buried near his home in the desert .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	35	Solomon then made Benaiah son of Jehoiada the commander of the army in Joab ’ s place . Solomon also made Zadok the new high priest in Abiathar ’ s place .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	36	Next , the king sent for Shimei and said to him , “ Build yourself a house here in Jerusalem to live in and don ’ t leave the city .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	37	If you leave the city and go any further than Kidron Brook , you will be killed , and it will be your own fault. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	38	Shimei answered , “ Yes , my king . I will obey you. ” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	39	But three years later , two of Shimei ’ s slaves ran away . They went to King Achish of Gath , who was the son of Maacah . Shimei heard that his slaves were in Gath ,
ERV	1%20Kings	2	41	But someone told Solomon that Shimei had left Jerusalem and gone to Gath and back .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	42	So Solomon sent for him and said , “ I made you promise in the Lord ’ s name not to leave Jerusalem . And I warned you that if you went anywhere , you would die . And you agreed to what I said . You said that you would obey me .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	43	So why didn ’ t you obey me ? Why did you break your promise to the Lord ?
ERV	1%20Kings	2	44	You know all the bad things you did to my father David . Now the Lord will punish you for it .
ERV	1%20Kings	2	45	But the Lord will bless me and keep David ’ s throne before him forever. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	2	46	Then the king ordered Benaiah to kill Shimei , and he did . So Solomon had full control of his kingdom . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Kings	3	3	Solomon showed that he loved the Lord by obeying everything his father David told him to do , except that Solomon continued to go to the high places to offer sacrifices and to burn incense .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	2	The Temple to honor the Lord had not yet been finished , so people were still making animal sacrifices on altars at the high places .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	4	King Solomon went to Gibeon to offer a sacrifice because that was the most important high place . He offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	5	While Solomon was at Gibeon , the Lord came to him at night in a dream . God said , “ Solomon , ask me what you want me to give you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon answered , “ You were very kind and loyal to your servant , my father David . He was faithful to you and lived a good , honest life . And you showed him the greatest kindness when you let his son take his place as king .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	7	Lord my God , you have made me the king in my father ’ s place , but I am like a small child . I don ’ t have the wisdom I need to do what I must do .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	8	I am your servant here among your chosen people . There are so many that they can not be counted .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	9	So I ask you to give me the wisdom to rule and judge them well and to help me know the difference between right and wrong . Without such great wisdom , it would be impossible to rule this great nation. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	10	The Lord was happy that Solomon asked for wisdom .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	11	So God said to him , “ You did not ask for long life and riches for yourself . You did not ask for the death of your enemies . You asked for the wisdom to listen and make the right decisions .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	12	So I will give you what you asked for . I will make you wise and intelligent . I will make you wiser than anyone who ever lived or ever will live .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	13	And I will also give you what you did not ask for . You will have riches and honor all your life . There will be no other king in the world as great as you .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	14	And I will give you a long life if you follow me and obey my laws and commands as your father David did. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	15	Solomon woke up and knew that God had spoken to him in the dream . Then Solomon went to Jerusalem and stood before the Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement . He offered a burnt offering and fellowship offerings to the Lord and then gave a party for all of his officials . Proof of Solomon ’ s Wisdom
ERV	1%20Kings	3	16	One day two prostitutes came to Solomon and stood before the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	17	One of the women said , “ Sir , this woman and I live in the same house . We were both pregnant and ready to give birth to our babies . I had my baby while she was there with me .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	18	Three days later she also gave birth to her baby . There was no one else in the house with us , just the two of us .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	19	One night while this woman was asleep with her baby , the baby died .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	20	That night while I was asleep , she took my son from my bed and carried him to her bed . Then she put the dead baby in my bed .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	21	In the morning I woke up and was about to feed the baby when I saw he was dead . When I looked at him more closely , I saw that he was not my baby. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	22	But the other woman said , “ No ! The dead baby is yours , and the one still alive is mine ! ” But the first woman said , “ No , you are wrong ! The dead baby is yours ! The one that is still alive is mine. ” So the two women argued in front of the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	23	Then King Solomon said , “ Each of you says that the living baby is your own and that the dead baby belongs to the other woman. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	24	Then King Solomon sent his servant to get a sword .
ERV	1%20Kings	3	25	He told the servant , “ Cut the living baby in two and give one half of the baby to each woman. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	26	The second woman said , “ Yes , cut him in two . Then neither of us will have him. ” But the first woman , the real mother , loved her son and said to the king , “ Please , sir , don ’ t kill the baby ! Give him to her. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	27	Then King Solomon said , “ Stop , don ’ t kill the baby . Give him to this woman . She is the real mother. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	3	28	The people of Israel respected the king when they heard about this decision . They saw he had the wisdom of God [ a ] to make the right decisions . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Kings	5	5	“ The Lord made a promise to my father David . He said , ‘ I will make your son king after you , and he will build a temple to honor me. ’ Now , I plan to build that temple to honor the Lord my God .
ERV	1%20Kings	5	2	This is what Solomon said to King Hiram :
ERV	1%20Kings	5	3	“ You remember that my father , King David , had to fight many wars all around him . So he was never able to build a temple to honor the Lord his God . King David was waiting until the Lord allowed him to defeat all his enemies .
ERV	1%20Kings	5	4	But now the Lord my God has given me peace along all the borders of my country . I have no enemies , and my people are in no danger .
ERV	1%20Kings	5	6	And so I ask you to help me . Send your men to Lebanon to cut down cedar trees for me . My servants will work with yours . I will pay you any price that you decide as your servants ’ wages , but I need your help . Our carpenters [ a ] are not as good as the carpenters of Sidon. ”

ERV	1%20Kings	5	9	My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea . Then I will tie them together and float them down the shore to the place you choose . There I will separate the logs , and you can take them from there . As payment for this , you will give food to all those who live in my palace. ”

ERV	1%20Kings	11	11	So the Lord said to Solomon , “ You have chosen to break your agreement with me . You have not obeyed my commands . So I promise that I will tear your kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	2	In the past the Lord had said to the Israelites , “ You must not marry people from other nations . If you do , they will cause you to follow their gods. ” But Solomon fell in love with these women .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	3	He had
ERV	1%20Kings	11	700	wives who were the daughters of leaders from other nations . He also had
ERV	1%20Kings	11	300	slave women who were like wives to him . His wives caused him to turn away from God .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	4	When Solomon was old , his wives caused him to follow other gods , so he did not follow the Lord completely as his father David did .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	5	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth , the goddess of Sidon , and Milcom , the horrible god of the Ammonites .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	6	So Solomon did what the Lord said was wrong . He did not follow the Lord completely as his father David did .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	7	On the mountain next to Jerusalem , Solomon built a place for worshiping Chemosh , that horrible idol of the Moabites . On the same mountain , Solomon built a place for worshiping Molech , that horrible idol of the Ammonites .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	8	Solomon did the same thing for all of his other foreign wives who burned incense and gave sacrifices to their gods .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	9	So Solomon did not remain faithful to the Lord , the God of Israel , even though God had appeared to him twice . The Lord became angry with him .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	10	He had told Solomon that he must not follow other gods , but Solomon did not obey the Lord ’ s command .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	12	But I loved your father David , so I will not take your kingdom away from you while you are alive . I will wait until your son becomes king . Then I will take it from him .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	13	Still , I will not tear away all the kingdom from your son . I will leave him one tribe to rule . I will do this for my servant David and for Jerusalem , the city I chose. ” Solomon ’ s Enemies
ERV	1%20Kings	11	14	Then the Lord raised up Hadad the Edomite to become Solomon ’ s enemy . Hadad was from the royal family of Edom .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	15	This is how it happened . In the past David fought against Edom . Joab was the commander of David ’ s army . Joab went to Edom to bury his dead soldiers . While there Joab killed all the Edomite men who were still alive .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	16	Joab and the men of Israel stayed in Edom for six months until they killed all the men of Edom .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	17	At the time Hadad was only a young boy . He and some of his father ’ s servants ran away to Egypt .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	18	They left Midian and went to Paran . In Paran some other people joined them and the whole group went to Egypt . They went to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and asked for help . Pharaoh gave Hadad a house , some land , and food to eat .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	19	Pharaoh liked Hadad so much that he gave Hadad a wife . She was Pharaoh ’ s sister-in-law . ( Pharaoh ’ s wife was Queen Tahpenes . )
ERV	1%20Kings	11	20	Hadad and the sister of Tahpenes had a son named Genubath . Queen Tahpenes let Genubath grow up in Pharaoh ’ s house with his children .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	21	In Egypt Hadad heard that David had died and that Joab , the commander of the army , was dead . So Hadad said to Pharaoh , “ Let me go home to my own country. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	11	22	But Pharaoh answered , “ I have given you everything you need here . Why do you want to go back to your own country ? ” Hadad answered , “ Please , just let me go home. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	11	23	God also raised up another man to become one of Solomon ’ s enemies . This man was Rezon , son of Eliada . Rezon ran away from his master , King Hadadezer of Zobah .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	24	After David defeated the army of Zobah , Rezon gathered some men and became the leader of a small army . He went to Damascus and stayed there to rule from Damascus .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	25	Rezon became the king of Aram . He was an enemy of Israel throughout Solomon ’ s life and added to the trouble that Hadad created for Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	26	There was also another person who became an enemy of Solomon . He was Jeroboam son of Nebat . He was an Ephraimite from the town of Zeredah . His mother was a widow named Zeruah . He was one of Solomon ’ s servants , but he rebelled against the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	27	This is the story about how Jeroboam turned against the king . Solomon was building the Millo and repairing the wall around the city of David , his father .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	28	Jeroboam was a free man . [ a ] Solomon saw that this young man was a skilled worker , so he made him the supervisor over all the workers from the tribes that descended from Joseph .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	29	One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem , the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him on the road . They were alone out in the country , and Ahijah was wearing a new coat .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	30	Ahijah took his new coat and tore it into twelve pieces .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	31	Then he said to Jeroboam , “ Take ten pieces of this coat for yourself because the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I will tear the kingdom away from Solomon , and I will give you ten of the tribes .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	32	I will let David ’ s family keep only one tribe . I will do this because of my servant David and because of Jerusalem , the city that I chose from among all the tribes of Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	33	I will take the kingdom from Solomon because he stopped following me and began worshiping Ashtoreth , the goddess of Sidon ; Chemosh , the god of Moab ; and Milcom , the god of the Ammonites . Solomon stopped following my ways and doing what I say is right . He does not obey my laws and commands as his father David did .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	34	So I will take the kingdom away from Solomon ’ s family . I chose David because he obeyed all my laws and commands . So for my servant David , I will let Solomon be the king for the rest of his life .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	35	But Jeroboam , I will take the ten tribes away from his son and give them to you .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	36	I will let Solomon ’ s son keep one tribe to rule over . I will do this for my servant David , so he will always have someone to rule near me in Jerusalem , the city that I chose to be my own .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	37	But I will make you king of Israel . [ b ] You will rule over everything you want .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	38	If you live right and obey all my commands as David did , I will be with you and make your family a family of kings , just as I did for David . And you will have Israel as your kingdom .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	39	I will punish David ’ s descendants because of what Solomon did , but not forever. ’ ” Solomon ’ s Death
ERV	1%20Kings	11	40	years .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	41	Everything else Solomon did , from the beginning to the end , is written in the book , The History of Solomon .
ERV	1%20Kings	11	42	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for
ERV	1%20Kings	11	43	Then he died [ c ] and was buried in the city of David , his father . Then Solomon ’ s son , Rehoboam , became the next king after him . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings 12:32 the festival Probably the Festival of Shelters . See “ Festival of Shelters ” in the Word List .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	12	Three days later , Jeroboam and all the people came back as Rehoboam had said .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father forced us to work very hard . Now , make it easier for us . Stop the heavy work that your father forced us to do and we will serve you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	5	Rehoboam answered , “ Come back to me in three days , and I will answer you. ” So the people left .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	6	There were some older men who had helped Solomon make decisions when he was alive . So King Rehoboam asked these men what he should do . He said , “ How do you think I should answer the people ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	7	They answered , “ If you are like a servant to them today , they will sincerely serve you . If you speak kindly to them , they will always work for you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam did not listen to the advice from the older men . He asked the young men who were his friends .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	9	Rehoboam asked them , “ The people said , ‘ Give us easier work than your father gave us. ’ How do you think I should answer them ? What should I tell them ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	10	Then the young men who grew up with him answered , “ Those people came to you and said , ‘ Your father forced us to work very hard . Now make our work easier. ’ So you should tell them , ‘ My little finger is stronger than my father ’ s whole body .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	11	My father forced you to work hard , but I will make you work much harder ! My father punished you with whips , but I will punish you with whips that have sharp metal tips. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	13	King Rehoboam did not listen to the advice from the older men , and he was rude to the people .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	14	He did what his friends told him to do and said , “ My father forced you to work hard , but I will make you work much harder ! My father punished you with whips , but I will punish you with whips that have sharp metal tips. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king did not do what the people wanted . The Lord caused this to happen . He did this in order to keep the promise he made to Jeroboam son of Nebat when he sent the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh to speak to him .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	16	The Israelites saw that the new king refused to listen to them , so they said to him , “ We are not part of David ’ s family are we ? We don ’ t get any of Jesse ’ s land , do we ? So , people of Israel , let ’ s go home and let David ’ s son rule his own people ! ” So the Israelites went home .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	18	A man named Adoniram was one of the men who directed the workers . King Rehoboam sent Adoniram to talk to the people , but the Israelites threw stones at him until he died . King Rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	19	So Israel rebelled against the family of David , and this is how things are even today .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	20	When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had come back , they called him to a meeting and made him king over all Israel . The tribe of Judah was the only tribe that continued to follow the family of David .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	21	Rehoboam went back to Jerusalem and gathered together an army of 180,000 men from the families of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin . Rehoboam wanted to go fight against the Israelites and take back his kingdom .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	22	But God spoke to a prophet named Shemaiah . He said ,
ERV	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Talk to Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and to men of Judah and Benjamin .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	24	Say to them , ‘ The Lord says that you must not go to war against your brothers . Everyone , go home ! I made all this happen. ’ ” So all the men in Rehoboam ’ s army obeyed the Lord . They went home , just as the Lord had commanded .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	25	Jeroboam rebuilt the city of Shechem , in the hill country of Ephraim , and lived there . Later he went to the city of Penuel [ b ] and rebuilt it . 26-27 Jeroboam said to himself , “ If the people keep going to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Lord ’ s Temple , someday they will want to be ruled by their old masters . They will want to be ruled by King Rehoboam of Judah . And then they will kill me. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	28	So the king asked his advisors what to do . They gave him their advice , and King Jeroboam made two golden calves . He said to the people , “ You don ’ t have to go to Jerusalem to worship anymore . Israel , these are the gods that brought you out of Egypt . [ c ] ”
ERV	1%20Kings	12	29	King Jeroboam put one golden calf in Bethel and the other one in the city of Dan . [ d ]
ERV	1%20Kings	12	30	What a terrible sin this was , because the Israelites started going to the cities of Dan and Bethel [ e ] to worship the calves .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	31	Jeroboam also built temples at the high places and chose priests from among the different tribes of Israel . ( He did not choose priests only from the tribe of Levi . )
ERV	1%20Kings	12	32	Then King Jeroboam started a new festival that was like the festival [ f ] in Judah , but it was on the 15th day of the eighth month . At this time the king offered sacrifices on the altar at Bethel . He and the priests he chose offered the sacrifices to the calves that he had set up at the high places he had made .
ERV	1%20Kings	12	33	So King Jeroboam chose his own time for a festival for the Israelites , the 15th day of the eighth month . And during that time he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the altar he had built at Bethel . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings 13:33 people … priests The Law taught that only people from the tribe of Levi could become priests .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	13	The old prophet told his sons to saddle his donkey . They put the saddle on the donkey , and the prophet left .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	2	The Lord had commanded the man of God to speak against the altar . He said , “ Altar , the Lord says to you : ‘ David ’ s family will have a son . His name will be Josiah . The priests of the high places are now burning incense on you , but Josiah will offer the priests on you and burn human bones on you , so you can never be used again ! ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	3	The man of God gave proof to the people that this would happen . He said , “ This is the proof that the Lord told me about . He said , ‘ This altar will break apart , and the ashes on it will fall onto the ground. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	4	When King Jeroboam heard the message from the man of God about the altar in Bethel , he took his hand off the altar and pointed at the man . He said , “ Arrest that man ! ” But when the king said this , his arm became paralyzed . He could not move it .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	5	Then the altar broke into pieces , and all its ashes fell onto the ground . This proved that what the man of God had said came from the Lord .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	6	Then King Jeroboam said to the man of God , “ Please pray to the Lord your God for me . Ask him to heal my arm. ” So the man of God prayed to the Lord , and the king ’ s arm was healed , as it was before .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	7	Then the king said to the man of God , “ Please come home with me . Come and eat with me . I will give you a gift. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	8	But the man of God said to the king , “ I will not go home with you , even if you give me half of your kingdom ! I will not eat or drink anything in this place .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	9	The Lord commanded me not to eat or drink anything here . He also commanded me not to go back the same way I came. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	10	So he took a different road home . He did not go back the same way he came to Bethel .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	11	There was an old prophet living in Bethel . His sons came and told him what the man of God did in Bethel and what he said to King Jeroboam .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	12	The old prophet said , “ Which way did he go when he left ? ” So the sons showed their father which road the man of God from Judah had taken .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	14	The old prophet went after the man of God . He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked him , “ Are you the man of God who just came from Judah ? ” The man of God answered , “ Yes , I am. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	15	So the old prophet said , “ Please come home and eat with me. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	16	But the man of God said , “ I can not go home with you . I can not eat or drink anything in this place .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	17	The Lord said to me , ‘ You must not eat or drink anything in that place , and you must go back on a different road. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	18	The old prophet lied to him and said , “ But I am a prophet like you . And an angel from the Lord came to me and told me to bring you home and give you something to eat and drink. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	19	So the man of God went to the old prophet ’ s house and ate and drank with him .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	20	While they were sitting at the table , the Lord spoke to the old prophet ,
ERV	1%20Kings	13	21	and the old prophet spoke to the man of God from Judah . He said , “ The Lord said that you did not obey him ! You did not do what he commanded .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	22	He told you not to eat or drink anything in this place , but you came back here and ate and drank . So your body will not be buried in your family grave. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	23	The man of God finished eating and drinking . Then the old prophet saddled the man ’ s donkey for him and the man left .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	24	On the way home , a lion attacked and killed the man of God . His body was lying on the road while the lion stood next to it . The donkey stood nearby .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	25	Some people came walking by and saw the body and the lion standing by it . They went into the city where the old prophet lived and told people what they had seen on the road .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	26	The old prophet heard the story and said , “ This is the man of God who did not obey the Lord ’ s command , so the Lord sent a lion to attack him . The lion has killed him , just as the Lord said would happen. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	27	Then the prophet told his sons to saddle his donkey , and they did so .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	28	The old prophet went to find the body lying on the road . The donkey and the lion were still standing near it . The lion had not eaten the body or hurt the donkey .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	29	The old prophet put the body on his donkey and carried it back to the city to cry for him and bury him .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	30	The old prophet buried the man in his own family grave . The old prophet cried for him and said , “ Oh , my brother , I am sorry for you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	31	So the old prophet buried the body . Then he said to his sons , “ When I die , bury me in this same grave . Put my bones next to his .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	32	The Lord used him to speak against the altar at Bethel and against the high places in the other towns in Samaria . And what he said will certainly happen. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	13	33	King Jeroboam did not change . He continued doing evil . He continued to choose people from different tribes to serve as priests [ a ] at the high places . Whoever wanted to be a priest was allowed to be one .
ERV	1%20Kings	13	34	This is the sin that caused the ruin and destruction of his kingdom . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Kings	14	1	Kings 14:31 died Literally , “ slept with his ancestors . ”
ERV	1%20Kings	14	14	Soon , the Lord will put a new king over Israel who will destroy Jeroboam ’ s family .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	2	Jeroboam said to his wife , “ Go to Shiloh and see the prophet Ahijah . He is the one who said that I would become king of Israel . Dress yourself so that people will not know that you are my wife .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	3	Give the prophet ten loaves of bread , some cakes , and a jar of honey . Then ask him what will happen to our son , and he will tell you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	14	4	So the king ’ s wife did what he said . She went to the home of Ahijah the prophet in Shiloh . Ahijah was very old and had become blind .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	5	But the Lord said to him , “ Jeroboam ’ s wife is coming to ask you about her son because he is sick . I will tell you what to say to her. ” When she came to Ahijah ’ s house , she pretended to be someone else .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	6	But when Ahijah heard her coming to the door , he said , “ Come in ! I know who you are . You are Jeroboam ’ s wife . Why are you pretending to be someone else ? I have some bad news for you .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	7	Go back and tell Jeroboam that this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Jeroboam , I chose you from among all the Israelites . I made you the ruler of my people .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	8	David ’ s family was ruling the kingdom of Israel , but I took the kingdom away from them and gave it to you . But you are not like my servant David . He always obeyed my commands and followed me with his whole heart . He did only what I accepted .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	9	But you have sinned worse than anyone who ruled before you . You stopped following me and made other gods for yourself . You made those statues to make me angry .
ERV	1%20Kings	14	10	So Jeroboam , I will bring troubles to your family . I will kill all the men in your family . I will destroy your family completely , like fire burning up dung .

ERV	1%20Kings	14	13	All Israel will cry for him . They will bury him , but he is the only one from Jeroboam ’ s family who will be buried . This is because he is the only one in Jeroboam ’ s family who pleased the Lord , the God of Israel .

ERV	1%20Kings	15	13	King Asa also took away the right of his mother Maacah to be queen mother . He did this because she had set up one of those awful Asherah poles . Asa cut down the pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley .

ERV	1%20Kings	17	17	Some time later the woman ’ s son became sick . He became worse and worse until he stopped breathing .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	2	Then the Lord said to Elijah ,
ERV	1%20Kings	17	3	“ Leave this place and go east . Hide near Kerith Ravine , east of the Jordan River .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	4	You can get your water from that stream , and I have commanded ravens to bring food to you there. ”

ERV	1%20Kings	17	6	Ravens brought Elijah food every morning and every evening , and he drank water from the stream .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	7	There was no rain , so after a while the stream became dry .

ERV	1%20Kings	17	9	“ Go to Zarephath in Sidon and stay there . There is a widow there that I commanded to take care of you. ”

ERV	1%20Kings	17	11	As she was going to get the water , Elijah said , “ Bring me a piece of bread too , please. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	12	The woman answered , “ I promise you , before the Lord your God , that I have nothing but a handful of flour in a jar and a little bit of olive oil in a jug . I came here to gather a few pieces of wood for a fire to cook our last meal . My son and I will eat it and then die from hunger. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	13	Elijah said to the woman , “ Don ’ t worry . Go home and cook your food as you said . But first make a small piece of bread from the flour that you have and bring it to me . Then cook some for yourself and your son .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	14	The Lord , the God of Israel , says , ‘ That jar of flour will never be empty and the jug will always have oil in it . This will continue until the day the Lord sends rain to the land. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	15	So the woman went home and did what Elijah told her to do . And Elijah , the woman , and her son had enough food for a long time .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	16	The jar of flour and the jug of oil were never empty . This happened just as the Lord said through Elijah .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	18	Then the woman said to Elijah , “ You are a man of God . Can you help me ? Or did you come here only to remind me of my sins and to make my son die ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	19	Elijah said to her , “ Give me your son. ” He took the boy from her and carried him upstairs . He laid him on the bed in the room where he was staying .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	20	Then Elijah cried out to the Lord . He said , “ Lord my God , this widow is letting me stay in her house . Will you do this bad thing to her ? Will you cause her son to die ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	21	Then Elijah lay on top of the boy three times . He prayed , “ Lord my God , let this boy live again ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	22	The Lord answered Elijah ’ s prayer . The boy began breathing again and was alive .
ERV	1%20Kings	17	23	Elijah carried the boy downstairs , gave him to his mother , and said , “ Look , your son is alive ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	17	24	The woman answered , “ Now I know that you really are a man from God . I know that the Lord really speaks through you ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings 18:32 about
ERV	1%20Kings	18	18	Elijah answered , “ I have not made trouble for Israel . You and your father ’ s family caused all the problems when you stopped obeying the Lord ’ s commands and began following the false gods .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	2	seahs of seed ” ( 14.6 l ) .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	3	So King Ahab told Obadiah to come to him . Obadiah was the man in charge of the king ’ s palace . ( Obadiah was a true follower of the Lord .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	4	gallons Literally , “
ERV	1%20Kings	18	100	of the Lord ’ s prophets in caves . I put
ERV	1%20Kings	18	50	in another . I brought them food and water .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	5	King Ahab said to Obadiah , “ Come with me . We will look at every spring and every stream in the land . We will see if we can find enough grass to keep our horses and mules alive . Then we will not have to kill our animals. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	6	They decided where each of them would go to look for water . Ahab went in one direction by himself , and Obadiah went in another direction by himself .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	7	As Obadiah was walking along the road by himself , he looked up , and there was Elijah . Obadiah recognized him and bowed down to show his respect . He said , “ Elijah ? Is it really you , master ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	8	Elijah answered , “ Yes , it is me . Now , go and tell your master , the king , that I am here. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	9	Obadiah said , “ If I tell Ahab that I know where you are , he will kill me ! I have done nothing wrong to you . Why do you want me to die ?
ERV	1%20Kings	18	10	As surely as the Lord your God lives , the king has been looking for you everywhere . He has sent people to every country to find you . He even made the rulers of those countries swear that you were not there .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	11	Now you want me to go and tell him that you are here !
ERV	1%20Kings	18	12	If I go tell King Ahab that you are here , the Spirit of the Lord might carry you away . Then when King Ahab comes here and can not find you , he will kill me ! I have followed the Lord since I was a boy .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	13	Surely you have heard what I did when Jezebel was killing the Lord ’ s prophets . I hid
ERV	1%20Kings	18	14	Now you want me to go and tell the king that you are here . The king will kill me ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	15	Elijah answered , “ I serve the Lord All-Powerful . As surely as he lives , I promise that I will stand before the king today. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	16	So Obadiah went to King Ahab and told him where Elijah was . King Ahab went to meet Elijah .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	17	When Ahab saw Elijah he said , “ Is that really you , the troublemaker of Israel ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	19	Now tell all the people of Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel . Also bring the
ERV	1%20Kings	18	450	prophets of Baal .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	400	prophets of the goddess Asherah , who get their support from Queen Jezebel. ” [ a ]
ERV	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab called all the Israelites and those prophets to Mount Carmel .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	21	Elijah came to all the people and said , “ You must decide what you are going to do . How long will you keep jumping from one side to the other ? If the Lord is the true God , follow him . But if Baal is the true God , then follow him ! ” The people said nothing .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	22	So Elijah said , “ I am the only prophet of the Lord here , but there are
ERV	1%20Kings	18	23	So bring us two bulls . Let the prophets of Baal have one bull . Let them kill it , cut it into pieces , and then put the meat on the wood . But don ’ t start the fire . I will do the same with the other bull , and I will not start the fire either .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	24	Prophets of Baal , pray to your god , and I will pray to the Lord . Whichever god answers the prayer and starts the fire is the true God. ” All the people agreed that this was a good idea .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ There are many of you , so you go first . Choose a bull and prepare it , but don ’ t start your fire. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	26	So the prophets took the bull that was given to them and prepared it . They started praying to Baal and prayed until noon . They said , “ Baal , please answer us ! ” But there was no sound . No one answered . Then they began jumping around on the altar they had built .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	27	At noon Elijah began to make fun of them . He said , “ If Baal really is a god , maybe you should pray louder ! Maybe he is busy . Maybe he is thinking about something , or maybe he stepped out for a moment ! He could be sleeping ! Maybe you should pray louder and wake him up ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	28	So the prophets prayed louder . They cut themselves with swords and spears . ( This was the way they worshiped . ) They cut themselves until they were bleeding all over .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	29	The afternoon passed but the fire still had not started . The prophets were out of control and continued to act this way until the time came for the evening sacrifice . But nothing happened—there was no answer from Baal . There was no sound . There was no one listening .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Now come here. ” So they gathered around Elijah . The Lord ’ s altar had been torn down , so Elijah repaired it .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	31	Elijah found twelve stones . There was one stone for each of the twelve tribes . These twelve tribes were named for the twelve sons of Jacob , the man who the Lord had named Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	32	Elijah used these stones to repair the altar to honor the Lord . He dug a small ditch around the altar . It was wide enough and deep enough to hold about
ERV	1%20Kings	18	33	Then Elijah put the wood on the altar . He cut the bull into pieces and laid the pieces on the wood .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	34	Then he said , “ Fill four jars with water . Pour the water on the pieces of meat and on the wood. ” Then Elijah said , “ Do it again. ” Then he said , “ Do it a third time. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	35	The water ran down off the altar and filled the ditch .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	36	At about the time for the afternoon sacrifice , the prophet Elijah approached the altar and prayed , “ Lord , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , I ask you now to prove that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant . Show these people that it was you who commanded me to do all these things .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	37	Lord , answer my prayer . Show these people that you , Lord , are God and that you are the one who is bringing them back to you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	38	Then fire came down from the Lord and burned the sacrifice , the wood , the stones , and the ground around the altar . Then it dried up all the water in the ditch .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	39	All the people saw this happen and bowed down to the ground and began saying , “ The Lord is God ! The Lord is God ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	40	Then Elijah said , “ Get the prophets of Baal ! Don ’ t let any of them escape ! ” So the people captured all the prophets . Then Elijah led them down to Kishon Creek and killed them all . The Rain Comes Again
ERV	1%20Kings	18	41	Then Elijah said to King Ahab , “ Now go eat and drink . A heavy rain is coming. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	42	So King Ahab went to eat . At the same time Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel . At the top of the mountain , Elijah bent down . He put his head between his knees .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	43	Then Elijah said to his servant , “ Go up higher and look toward the sea. ” The servant went and looked . He came back and said , “ I saw nothing. ” Elijah told him to go look again . This happened seven times .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	44	The seventh time , the servant came back and said , “ I saw a small cloud the size of a man ’ s fist that was coming in from the sea. ” Elijah told the servant , “ Go tell King Ahab to get his chariot ready and go home now . If he does not leave now , the rain will stop him. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	18	45	After a short time the sky was covered with dark clouds . The wind began to blow , and a heavy rain began to fall . Ahab got in his chariot and started back to Jezreel .
ERV	1%20Kings	18	46	The power of the Lord came to Elijah . He used his belt to hold up the bottom of his robe away from his feet . Then he ran ahead of King Ahab all the way to Jezreel . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Kings	19	19	So Elijah left that place and went to find Elisha son of Shaphat . Elisha was plowing
ERV	1%20Kings	19	2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah and said , “ I swear that by this time tomorrow , you will be just as dead as those prophets . If I don ’ t succeed , may the gods do the same or worse to me. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	3	When Elijah heard this , he was afraid . So he ran away to save his life . He took his servant with him , and they went to Beersheba in Judah . Then Elijah left his servant in Beersheba
ERV	1%20Kings	19	4	and walked for a whole day into the desert . Then he sat down under a bush and asked to die . He said , “ I have had enough , Lord ! Take my life . I am no better than my ancestors. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	5	Then Elijah lay down under the bush and went to sleep . An angel came to him and touched him . The angel said , “ Get up and eat ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	6	Elijah looked around , and by his head there was a cake that had been baked over coals and a jar of water . He ate and drank and then went back to sleep .
ERV	1%20Kings	19	7	Later the Lord ’ s angel came to him again , touched him , and said , “ Get up and eat ! If you don ’ t , you will not be strong enough to make the long trip. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	8	So Elijah got up . He ate and drank and felt strong . Then Elijah walked for
ERV	1%20Kings	19	40	days and nights to Mount Horeb , the mountain of God .
ERV	1%20Kings	19	9	There Elijah went into a cave and spent the night . Then the Lord said to him , “ Elijah , why are you here ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	10	Elijah answered , “ Lord God All-Powerful , I have always served you the best I can , but the Israelites have broken their agreement with you . They destroyed your altars and killed your prophets . I am the only prophet left alive , and now they are trying to kill me ! ”

ERV	1%20Kings	19	13	When Elijah heard the voice , he used his coat to cover his face and went to the entrance to the cave and stood there . Then a voice said to him , “ Elijah , why are you here ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	14	Elijah said , “ Lord God All-Powerful , I have always served you the best that I can , but the Israelites broke their agreement with you . They destroyed your altars and killed your prophets . I am the only prophet left alive , and now they are trying to kill me. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	15	The Lord said , “ Go back . Take the road that leads to the desert around Damascus . Go into Damascus and anoint Hazael as king over Aram .
ERV	1%20Kings	19	16	Then anoint Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel . Next , anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah . He will be the prophet who takes your place .
ERV	1%20Kings	19	17	Jehu will kill anyone who escapes Hazael ’ s sword , and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes from Jehu ’ s sword .
ERV	1%20Kings	19	18	I still have
ERV	1%20Kings	19	7000	people in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed that idol. ” Elisha Becomes a Prophet
ERV	1%20Kings	19	20	Elisha immediately left his oxen and ran after Elijah . Elisha said , “ Let me kiss my mother and father goodbye . Then I will follow you. ” Elijah answered , “ You can do that . I will not stop you . [ e ] ”
ERV	1%20Kings	19	21	Elisha turned away from him and went back . He killed the oxen and used the yoke for firewood . He boiled the meat , gave it to the people , and they all ate together . Then Elisha went to follow Elijah and became his helper . Footnotes -

ERV	1%20Kings	20	20	Each of the men of Israel killed the man who had come against him . So the men from Aram began to run away and the army of Israel chased them . King Ben-Hadad escaped on a horse with the chariots .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	32	They dressed in rough cloth with ropes on their heads . They came to the king of Israel . They said , “ Your servant , Ben-Hadad , says , ‘ Please let me live. ’ ” Ahab said , “ Is he still alive ? He is my brother . [ c ] ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	2	The king sent messengers to King Ahab of Israel who was inside the city .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	3	The message was , “ Ben-Hadad says , ‘ Your silver and your gold are mine , and so are the best of your wives and children. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	4	The king of Israel answered , “ Yes , my lord and king , I am yours now , and everything I have belongs to you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	5	Then the messengers came back to Ahab . They said , “ Ben-Hadad says , ‘ I told you before that all of your silver and gold and your wives and children belong to me . So give them to me !
ERV	1%20Kings	20	6	Tomorrow I will send my men to search through your house and through the houses of your officials . Give my men all of your valuables , and they will bring them back to me. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	7	So King Ahab called a meeting of all the elders of his country and said , “ Look , Ben-Hadad is looking for trouble . First he told me that I must give him my wives and children and my silver and gold . I agreed to give them to him. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	8	But the elders and all the people said , “ Don ’ t obey him or do what he says. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	9	So Ahab sent a message to Ben-Hadad that said , “ I will do what you said at first , but I can not obey your second command. ” King Ben-Hadad ’ s men carried the message to the king .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	10	Then they came back with another message from Ben-Hadad that said , “ I will completely destroy Samaria . I promise that there will be nothing left of that city ! There will not be enough of that city left for my men to find any souvenirs [ a ] to take home . May the gods destroy me if I don ’ t do this ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	11	King Ahab answered , “ Tell Ben-Hadad that the man who puts on his armor should not boast as much as the man who lives long enough to take it off. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	12	King Ben-Hadad was drinking in his tent with the other rulers when the messengers came back and gave him the message from King Ahab . King Ben-Hadad commanded his men to prepare to attack the city , so the men moved into their places for the battle .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	13	Then a prophet went to King Ahab and said , “ King Ahab , the Lord says to you , ‘ Do you see that great army ? I will defeat that army for you today . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	14	Ahab said , “ Who will you use to defeat them ? ” The prophet answered , “ The Lord says , ‘ The young men who carry the weapons for the government officials. ’ ” Then the king asked , “ Who should command the main army ? ” The prophet answered , “ You will. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	15	So Ahab gathered the young helpers of the government officials . There were
ERV	1%20Kings	20	232	of these young men . Then the king called together the army of Israel . The total number was
ERV	1%20Kings	20	7000	.
ERV	1%20Kings	20	16	King Ahab began his attack at noon , while King Ben-Hadad and the
ERV	1%20Kings	20	17	The young helpers went out first . King Ben-Hadad ’ s men told him that some soldiers had come out of Samaria .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	18	So Ben-Hadad said , “ They might be coming to fight or they might be coming to ask for peace . Capture them alive. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	19	The young men of King Ahab were the first to come out , but the rest of the army of Israel was following them .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	21	King Ahab led the army and attacked all the horses and chariots . So King Ahab made the Arameans suffer a great defeat .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	22	Then the prophet went to King Ahab and said , “ The king of Aram will come back to fight again next spring . So go back and strengthen your army and make careful plans to defend yourself against him. ” Ben-Hadad Attacks Again
ERV	1%20Kings	20	23	King Ben-Hadad ’ s officers said to him , “ The gods of Israel are mountain gods . We fought in a mountain area , so the Israelites won . If we fight them on level ground , we will win .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	24	Also , don ’ t let the
ERV	1%20Kings	20	25	Let ’ s gather an army like the one that was destroyed . Gather as many men , horses , and chariots as before , and fight the Israelites on level ground . Then we will win. ” Ben-Hadad followed their advice and did what they said .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	26	So in the spring , Ben-Hadad gathered the men of Aram and went to Aphek to fight against Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	27	The Israelites also prepared for war and went to fight the army of Aram . They made their camp opposite the camp of Aram . The Aramean soldiers filled the land , but Israel ’ s army looked like two small flocks of goats .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	28	A man of God came to the king of Israel with this message : “ The Lord said , ‘ The people of Aram said that I , the Lord , am a god of the mountains and not a god of the valleys . So I will let you defeat this great army . Then all of you will know that I am the Lord , wherever you are ! ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	29	The armies were camped across from each other for seven days . On the seventh day the battle began . The Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean soldiers in one day .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	30	The survivors ran away to the city of Aphek . The wall of the city fell on 27,000 of those soldiers . Ben-Hadad also ran away to the city and hid in a room .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	31	His servants said to him , “ We heard that the kings of Israel are merciful . Let ’ s dress in rough cloth with ropes on our heads . [ b ] Then let ’ s go to the king of Israel . Maybe he will let us live. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	33	Ben-Hadad ’ s men wanted King Ahab to say something to show that he would not kill King Ben-Hadad . When Ahab called Ben-Hadad his brother , the advisors quickly said , “ Yes ! Ben-Hadad is your brother. ” Ahab said , “ Bring him to me. ” So Ben-Hadad came to King Ahab . King Ahab asked him to get in the chariot with him .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	34	Ben-Hadad said to him , “ Ahab , I will give you the towns that my father took from your father . And you can put shops in Damascus , as my father did in Samaria. ” Ahab answered , “ If you agree to this , I will let you go free. ” So the two kings made a peace agreement . Then King Ahab let King Ben-Hadad go free . A Prophet Speaks Against Ahab
ERV	1%20Kings	20	35	One of the prophets told another prophet , “ Hit me ! ” He said that because the Lord had commanded it . But the other prophet refused to hit him .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	36	So the first prophet said , “ You did not obey the Lord ’ s command . So a lion will kill you when you leave this place. ” When the second prophet left , a lion killed him .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	37	The first prophet went to another man and said , “ Hit me ! ” This man hit him and hurt the prophet .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	38	So the prophet wrapped his face with a cloth . This way no one could see who he was . The prophet went and waited for the king by the road .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	39	The king came by and the prophet said to him , “ I went to fight in the battle . One of our men brought an enemy soldier to me . The man said , ‘ Guard this man . If he runs away , you will have to give your life in his place or you will have to pay a fine of
ERV	1%20Kings	20	75	pounds Literally , “
ERV	1%20Kings	20	40	While I was busy doing other things , the man ran away. ” The king of Israel answered , “ You admitted that you are guilty , so you know the answer . You must do what the man said. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	41	Then the prophet quickly took the cloth from his face , and the king of Israel saw that he was one of the prophets .
ERV	1%20Kings	20	42	Then the prophet said to the king , “ The Lord says to you , ‘ You set free the man I said should die . So you will take his place—you and your people will die ! ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	20	43	Then the king went back home to Samaria . He was worried and upset . Footnotes -
ERV	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings
ERV	1%20Kings	21	21	So this is what he says to you : ‘ I will make something bad happen to you . I will kill you and every male in your family .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	2	One day Ahab said to Naboth , “ Give me your vineyard that is near my palace . I want to make it a vegetable garden . I will give you a better vineyard in its place . Or , if you prefer , I will pay you for it. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	3	Naboth answered , “ By the Lord , I will never give my land to you . This land belongs to my family. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went home angry and upset because Naboth told him , “ I will not give you my family ’ s land. ” Ahab went to bed , turned away from everyone , and refused to eat .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	5	His wife Jezebel went to him and asked him , “ Why are you upset ? Why do you refuse to eat ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	6	Ahab answered , “ I asked Naboth from Jezreel to give me his vineyard . I told him that I would pay him the full price . Or , if he preferred , I would give him another vineyard . But he refused to give it to me. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	7	Jezebel answered , “ But you are the king over Israel ! Get out of bed and eat something , and you will feel better . I will get Naboth ’ s vineyard for you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	8	Then Jezebel wrote some letters . She signed Ahab ’ s name to them and used his seal to seal the letters . Then she sent them to the elders and important men who lived in the same town as Naboth .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	9	This is what the letter said : “ Announce that there will be a day of fasting when the people will eat nothing . Then call all the people of the town together for a meeting . At the meeting we will talk about Naboth .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	10	Find some men who will tell lies about Naboth . They should say that they heard Naboth speak against the king and against God . Then take Naboth out of the city and kill him with stones. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	11	So the elders and important men of Jezreel obeyed the command .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	12	The leaders announced that there would be a day when all the people would eat nothing . On that day they called all the people together for a meeting . They put Naboth in a special place before the people .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	13	Then two men told the people that they heard Naboth speak against God and the king . So the people carried Naboth out of the city and killed him with stones .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	14	Then the leaders sent a message to Jezebel that said : “ Naboth has been killed. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	15	When Jezebel heard this , she said to Ahab , “ Naboth is dead . Now you can go and take the vineyard that you wanted. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	16	So Ahab went to the vineyard and took it for his own .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	17	Then the Lord spoke to Elijah , the prophet from Tishbe :
ERV	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Go to King Ahab in Samaria . He will be at Naboth ’ s vineyard . He is there to take the vineyard as his own .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	19	Tell Ahab that I , the Lord , say to him , ‘ Ahab ! You killed the man Naboth and now you are taking his land . So I , the Lord , tell you this : Where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth , they will lick up your blood as well. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	20	So Elijah went to Ahab . When Ahab saw him , he said , “ Well , my enemy has found me again ! ” Elijah answered , “ Yes , I found you , because you have again sold yourself out to do what the Lord says is evil .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	22	I will destroy your family just as I destroyed the families of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and King Baasha . I will do this to you because you have made me angry and you have caused the Israelites to sin. ’
ERV	1%20Kings	21	23	The Lord also says this about your wife Jezebel : ‘ Dogs will eat the body of Jezebel by the wall of the city of Jezreel .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	24	As for the family of Ahab , whoever dies in the city will be eaten by dogs , and whoever dies in the fields will be eaten by birds. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	21	25	So Ahab sold himself out to do what the Lord says is evil . There is no one who did as much evil as Ahab and his wife Jezebel , who caused him to do these things .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	26	Ahab committed the terrible sin of worshiping those filthy idols , just as the Amorites did . And that is why the Lord took the land from them and gave it to the Israelites .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	27	When Ahab heard what Elijah said , he tore his clothes to show how sad he was . Then he put on sackcloth and refused to eat . He even slept in these clothes . He was very sad and upset .
ERV	1%20Kings	21	28	The Lord said to the prophet Elijah from Tishbe ,
ERV	1%20Kings	21	29	“ Look , Ahab has humbled himself before me . So I will not make that disaster happen during his lifetime . I will wait until his son is king . Then I will destroy his family . ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	1	Kings 22:49 King Ahaziah … ships Jehoshaphat controlled the port of Ezion Geber which was Israel ’ s only way to the Red Sea and the coasts of Africa , the Arabian Peninsula , and the coasts leading to the Persian Gulf and India . Ahaziah thought he could get control of that area by “ helping ” Jehoshaphat .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	22	The spirit answered , ‘ I will go to Ahab ’ s prophets and cause them to tell lies. ’ So the Lord said , ‘ Yes , that will fool Ahab . Go out and do that. ’
ERV	1%20Kings	22	2	Then during the third year , King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	3	Ahab asked his officials , “ Remember when the king of Aram took Ramoth Gilead from us ? That city is ours , so why have we done nothing to get it back ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	4	So Ahab asked King Jehoshaphat , “ Will you join with us to go fight the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead ? ” Jehoshaphat answered , “ Yes , you and I will be as one—my men and my horses will be as yours .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	5	But first let ’ s ask the Lord for advice. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	6	So Ahab called a meeting of the prophets . There were about
ERV	1%20Kings	22	400	prophets at that time . Ahab asked the prophets , “ Should I go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not ? ” The prophets answered Ahab , “ Yes , because the Lord will let you defeat Ramoth Gilead. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat said , “ Doesn ’ t the Lord have another prophet here ? Let ’ s ask him the same question. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	8	King Ahab answered , “ Yes , there is another prophet . His name is Micaiah son of Imlah . But I hate him because he will not say anything good about me when he speaks for the Lord . He always says things that I don ’ t like. ” Jehoshaphat said , “ The king should not say that ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	9	So King Ahab told one of his officers to go and find Micaiah .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	10	At that time the two kings were sitting on their thrones , with their royal robes on , at the judgment place near the gates of Samaria . All the prophets were standing before them , prophesying .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	11	One of the prophets was named Zedekiah son of Kenaanah . Zedekiah made some iron horns [ a ] and said to Ahab , “ The Lord says , ‘ You will use these iron horns to fight against the army of Aram . You will defeat them and destroy them. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	12	All the other prophets agreed with Zedekiah and said , “ Your army should march now to go fight against the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead . You will win the battle . The Lord will let you defeat them. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	13	While this was happening , the officer went to find Micaiah . When he found him , the officer told him , “ All the other prophets have said that the king will succeed , so you should say the same thing. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah answered , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I can say only what the Lord says. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	15	Micaiah went and stood before King Ahab . The king asked him , “ Micaiah , should we go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not ? ” Micaiah answered , “ Yes , go and be successful ! The Lord will let you take the city. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	16	But Ahab answered , “ How many times do I have to tell you ? Tell me the truth . What does the Lord say ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	17	So Micaiah answered , “ I can see the army of Israel scattered all over the hills , like sheep with no one to lead them . This is what the Lord says : ‘ These men have no leaders . Let them go home in peace. ’ ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	18	Then Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ See , I told you ! This prophet never says anything good about me . He always says something bad. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	19	But Micaiah said , “ Listen to this message from the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne . All of heaven ’ s army was standing around him , some on his left side and some on his right side .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	20	The Lord said , ‘ Which of you will go fool Ahab into attacking the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead so that he will be killed ? ’ The angels discussed many different plans .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	21	Then a spirit [ b ] went and stood before the Lord and said , ‘ I will fool him ! ’ The Lord asked , ‘ How will you do it ? ’
ERV	1%20Kings	22	23	“ So that is what has happened here . The Lord made your prophets lie to you . The Lord himself decided to bring this disaster to you. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	24	Then the prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and hit him on the face . Zedekiah said , “ How is it that the Spirit of the Lord left me to speak through you ? ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	25	years . His mother was Azubah , the daughter of Shilhi .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	26	Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers to arrest Micaiah . Ahab said , “ Arrest him and take him to Amon the governor of the city and prince Joash .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	27	Tell them to put Micaiah in prison . Give him nothing but bread and water to eat . Keep him there until I come home from the battle. ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	28	Micaiah said , “ Listen to me , everyone ! Ahab , if you come back alive from the battle , the Lord has not spoken through me. ” The Battle at Ramoth Gilead
ERV	1%20Kings	22	29	King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to fight the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	30	Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ Disguise yourself when you go into battle , but wear your own clothes . And I will disguise myself. ” The king of Israel went into battle dressed like an ordinary soldier .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	31	The king of Aram had
ERV	1%20Kings	22	32	When the commanders saw King Jehoshaphat , they thought he was the king of Israel , and so they went to kill him . Jehoshaphat started shouting .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	33	When the commanders saw that he was not King Ahab , they stopped chasing him .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	34	Then a soldier in the distance pulled back as far as he could on his bow and shot an arrow into the air . The arrow happened to hit the king of Israel in a small hole where his armor was fastened together . King Ahab said to his chariot driver , “ I ’ ve been hit ! Turn the chariot around and take me off the battlefield ! ”
ERV	1%20Kings	22	35	years old when he became king , and he ruled in Jerusalem for
ERV	1%20Kings	22	36	At sunset all the Israelites cheered when they were told to go home . So they all went back to their hometowns .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	37	And that is how King Ahab died . Some men carried his body to Samaria and buried him there .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	38	They took his chariot to the large pool in Samaria to clean it . The dogs licked up Ahab ’ s blood while the prostitutes washed the chariot . This happened just as the Lord said it would .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	39	The rest of what King Ahab did during the time he ruled is written in the book , The History of the Kings of Israel . That book tells about all the cities he built and about all the ivory that he used to decorate his palace .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	40	Ahab died and was buried with his ancestors . His son Ahaziah became the next king after him . Summary of Jehoshaphat ’ s Rule
ERV	1%20Kings	22	41	Jehoshaphat son of Asa became the king of Judah in Ahab ’ s fourth year as king of Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was
ERV	1%20Kings	22	43	Like his father Asa , Jehoshaphat was good and did everything that the Lord wanted , but he did not destroy the high places . The people continued offering sacrifices and burning incense there .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	44	Jehoshaphat made a peace agreement with the king of Israel .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	45	Jehoshaphat was very brave and fought many wars . The rest of what he did is written in the book , The History of the Kings of Judah .
ERV	1%20Kings	22	46	Jehoshaphat forced all the men and women who sold their bodies for sex to leave the places of worship . They had served in these places of worship while his father Asa was king .

ERV	2%20Kings	16	10	King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath Pileser of Assyria . Ahaz saw the altar at Damascus . He sent a model and pattern of this altar to Uriah the priest .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	11	Then Uriah the priest built an altar just like the model King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus . Uriah the priest built the altar this way before King Ahaz came back from Damascus .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	12	When the king arrived from Damascus , he saw the altar . He offered sacrifices on the altar .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	13	Ahaz burned his burnt offerings and grain offerings on it . He poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on this altar .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	14	Ahaz took the bronze altar that was before the Lord from the front of the Temple . This bronze altar was between Ahaz ’ s altar and the Temple of the Lord . Ahaz put the bronze altar on the north side of his own altar .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	15	He commanded Uriah the priest , “ Use the large altar to burn the morning burnt offerings , the evening grain offerings , and the drink offerings from all the people of this country . Sprinkle all the blood from the burnt offering and other sacrifices on the large altar . But I will use the bronze altar to get answers from God. ”
ERV	2%20Kings	16	17	There were carts with bronze panels and basins for the priests to wash their hands . King Ahaz removed the panels and basins and cut up the carts . He also took the large tank [ b ] off the bronze bulls that stood under it . He put the large tank on a stone pavement .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	18	Workers had built a covered place inside the Temple area for the Sabbath meetings . But Ahaz removed the covered place and the outside entrance for the king . He removed all these from the Lord ’ s Temple . Ahaz did this because of the king of Assyria .
ERV	2%20Kings	16	19	All the great things that Ahaz did are written in the book , The History of the Kings of Judah .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	2	Kings 17:11 places for worship Or “ high places , ” places for worshiping God or false gods . These places were often on the hills and mountains .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	17	They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire . They used magic and witchcraft to try to learn the future . They sold themselves to do what the Lord said was evil . They did this to make him angry .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	3	King Shalmaneser of Assyria came to fight against Hoshea and defeated him . So Hoshea paid tribute to Shalmaneser .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	4	Later , Hoshea sent messengers to the king of Egypt to ask for help . That king ’ s name was So . That year Hoshea did not pay tribute to the king of Assyria as he did every other year . The king of Assyria learned that Hoshea had made plans against him . So he arrested Hoshea and put him in jail .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	5	The king of Assyria attacked many places in Israel . Then he came to Samaria and fought against it for three years .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	6	The king of Assyria took Samaria during the ninth year that Hoshea was king of Israel . He captured many Israelites and took them as prisoners to Assyria . He made them live in Halah by the Habor River at Gozan and in other cities of the Medes .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	7	These things happened because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God . And it was the Lord who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt ! He saved them from the power of Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . But the Israelites began worshiping other gods .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	8	They began doing the same things that other people did . And the Lord had forced those people to leave their land when the Israelites came . The Israelites also chose to be ruled by kings .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	9	The Israelites secretly did things against the Lord their God , and those things were wrong ! The Israelites built high places in all their cities—from the smallest town to the largest city .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	10	They put up memorial stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	11	They burned incense there in all those places for worship . [ a ] They did these things like the nations that the Lord forced out of the land before them . The Israelites did evil things that made the Lord angry .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	12	They served idols , and the Lord had said to them , “ You must not do this. ”
ERV	2%20Kings	17	13	The Lord used every prophet and every seer to warn Israel and Judah . He said , “ Turn away from the evil things you do . Obey my commands and laws . Follow all the law that I gave to your ancestors . I used my servants the prophets to give this law to you. ”
ERV	2%20Kings	17	14	But the people would not listen . They were very stubborn like their ancestors . Their ancestors did not believe the Lord their God .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	15	They refused to follow his laws and the agreement he made with their ancestors . They would not listen to his warnings . They worshiped idols that were worth nothing and they themselves became worth nothing . The Lord had warned them not to do the evil things that the people in the nations around them did . But they lived the same way those people lived .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	16	The people stopped following the commands of the Lord their God . They made two gold statues of calves . They made Asherah poles . They worshiped all the stars of heaven and served Baal .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	18	So the Lord became very angry with Israel and removed them from his sight . There were no Israelites left , except the tribe of Judah . The People of Judah Are Also Guilty
ERV	2%20Kings	17	19	But even the people of Judah did not obey the commands of the Lord their God . They lived just as the Israelites had .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	20	The Lord rejected all the Israelites . He brought them many troubles . He let people destroy them . Finally , he threw them away and removed them from his sight .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	21	He tore them from the family of David , and they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king . Jeroboam pulled the Israelites away from following the Lord . He caused them to commit a great sin .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	22	So the Israelites sinned in all the ways Jeroboam did . And they did not stop committing these sins
ERV	2%20Kings	17	23	until the Lord took Israel away from his sight . And he said this would happen . He sent his prophets to tell the people this would happen . So the Israelites were taken out of their country into Assyria . And they have been there to this day . Foreigners Settle in Israel
ERV	2%20Kings	17	24	The king of Assyria took the Israelites out of Samaria and brought in other people from Babylon , Cuthah , Avva , Hamath , and Sepharvaim . They took over Samaria and lived in the cities around it .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	25	When these people began to live in Samaria , they did not honor the Lord , so the Lord sent lions to attack them . The lions killed some of them .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	26	Some people said to the king of Assyria , “ The people who you took away and put in the cities of Samaria don ’ t know the law of the god of that country . So that god sent lions to attack them . The lions killed them because they don ’ t know the law of the god of that country. ”
ERV	2%20Kings	17	27	So the king of Assyria gave this command : “ You took some priests from Samaria . Send one of them who I captured back to Samaria . Let that priest go and live there . Then he can teach the people the law of the god of that country. ”
ERV	2%20Kings	17	28	So one of the priests who the Assyrians had carried away from Samaria came to live in Bethel . He taught the people how they should honor the Lord .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	29	But all those people made gods of their own . They put them in the temples at the high places that the people of Samaria had made . They did this wherever they lived .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	30	The people of Babylon made the false god Succoth Benoth . The people of Cuthah made the false god Nergal . The people of Hamath made the false god Ashima .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	31	The people of Avva made the false gods Nibhaz and Tartak . The people from Sepharvaim also burned their children in the fire to honor their false gods , Adrammelech and Anammelech .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	32	But they also worshiped the Lord . They chose priests for the high places from among the people . These priests made sacrifices for the people in the temples at those places of worship .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	33	They respected the Lord but also served their own gods , just as they did in their own countries .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	34	Even today , they live the same way they did in the past . They don ’ t honor the Lord . They don ’ t obey the rules and commands of the Israelites . They don ’ t obey the law or the commands that the Lord gave to the children of Jacob .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	35	The Lord made an agreement with the Israelites . He commanded them , “ You must not honor other gods . You must not worship them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	36	But you must follow the Lord , who brought you out of Egypt . He used his great power to save you . You must worship him and make sacrifices to him .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	37	You must obey the rules , laws , teachings , and commands that he wrote for you . You must obey these things all the time . You must not respect other gods .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	38	You must not forget the agreement that I made with you . You must not respect other gods .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	39	No , you must respect only the Lord your God . Then he will save you from all your enemies. ”
ERV	2%20Kings	17	40	But the Israelites did not listen . They kept on doing the same things they did before .
ERV	2%20Kings	17	41	So now those other nations respected the Lord , but they also served their own idols . Their children and grandchildren did the same thing their ancestors did . They still do these things to this day . Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Kings	19	20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah . Isaiah said , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , says this : You prayed to me about the message that came from King Sennacherib of Assyria . I have heard you .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	7	King Solomon also dedicated the middle of the courtyard , the part that is in front of the Temple of the Lord . There he offered burnt offerings , grain offerings , and the fat from the animals that were used as fellowship offerings . He did this because the bronze altar he had built was too small to hold all these offerings .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Then the Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him , “ Solomon , I have heard your prayer , and I have chosen this place for myself to be a house for sacrifices .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then I will make you a strong king and your kingdom will be great . That is the agreement I made with David your father when I told him that Israel would always be ruled by one of his descendants .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	19	“ But if you don ’ t obey my laws and commands that I gave you , and if you worship other gods and serve them ,
ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	20	then I will take the Israelites out from my land that I gave them . And I will leave this Temple that I have made holy for my name . I will make this Temple something that all the nations will speak evil about .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	21	Everyone who sees it will be amazed . They will ask , ‘ Why did the Lord do this terrible thing to this land and to this temple ? ’
ERV	2%20Chronicles	7	22	People will say , ‘ This happened because they left the Lord , the God of their ancestors . He brought them out of Egypt , but they decided to follow other gods . They began to worship and to serve those gods . That is why he caused all these bad things to happen to them. ’ ” Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	7	King Ahab answered , “ Yes , there is another prophet . His name is Micaiah son of Imlah . But I hate him . He never says anything good about me when he speaks for the Lord . He always says things that I don ’ t like. ” Jehoshaphat said , “ The king shouldn ’ t say things like that ! ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	8	So King Ahab told one of his officers to go and find Micaiah .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	9	At that time the two kings were sitting on their thrones , with their royal robes on , at the judgment place near the gates of Samaria . All the prophets were standing before them , prophesying .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	12	While this was happening , the officer went to find Micaiah . When he found him , the officer told him , “ All the other prophets have said that the king will succeed , so you should say the same thing. ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Micaiah answered , “ As surely as the Lord lives , I can say only what my God says. ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	14	Micaiah went and stood before King Ahab . The king asked him , “ Micaiah , should we go and attack the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead or not ? ” Micaiah answered , “ Yes , go and be successful ! You will take the city. ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	15	But Ahab answered , “ How many times do I have to tell you ? Tell me the truth . What does the Lord say ? ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	16	So Micaiah answered , “ I can see the army of Israel scattered all over the hills , like sheep with no one to lead them . This is what the Lord says : ‘ These men have no leaders . Let them go home in peace. ’ ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	17	Then Ahab said to Jehoshaphat , “ See , I told you ! This prophet never says anything good about me . He always says something bad. ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	19	The Lord said , ‘ Which of you will go fool Ahab into attacking the Arameans at Ramoth Gilead so that he will be killed ? ’ The angels discussed many different plans .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Then a spirit went and stood before the Lord . He said , ‘ I will fool him ! ’ The Lord asked , ‘ How will you do it ? ’
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	21	He answered , ‘ I will go out and become a spirit of lies in the mouths of Ahab ’ s prophets—they will all speak lies. ’ So the Lord said , ‘ Yes , that will fool Ahab . Go out and do that ! ’
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	22	“ So that is what has happened here . The Lord made your prophets lie to you . The Lord himself decided to bring this disaster to you. ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then the prophet Zedekiah went to Micaiah and hit him on the face . Zedekiah said , “ How is it that the Spirit of the Lord left me to speak through you ? ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Micaiah answered , “ Look , what I said will happen ! And when you see it , you will go into the deepest part of your house to hide ! ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	25	Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers to arrest Micaiah . Ahab said , “ Arrest him and take him to Amon the governor of the city and prince Joash .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	26	Tell them to put Micaiah in prison . Give him nothing but bread and water to eat . Keep him there until I come home from the battle. ”

ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	33	Then a soldier pulled back on his bow and shot an arrow into the air . By chance it hit the king of Israel between two pieces of his armor . King Ahab said to his chariot driver , “ I ’ ve been hit ! Turn the chariot around and take me off the battlefield ! ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	18	34	The armies continued fighting all that day . King Ahab leaned against the side of his chariot to hold himself up , facing the Arameans . He watched until evening . Then , just as the sun was setting , he died . Footnotes -

ERV	2%20Chronicles	19	19	King Jehoshaphat of Judah came back safely to his house in Jerusalem .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day Jehoshaphat and his army met in the Valley of Beracah . [ d ] They praised the Lord . That is why people still call that place , “ The Valley of Beracah. ”

ERV	2%20Chronicles	21	10	Since that time and until now the country of Edom has been rebellious against Judah . The people from the town of Libnah also turned against Jehoram . This happened because Jehoram left the Lord God . He is the God Jehoram ’ s ancestors followed .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	28	3	He burned incense in the Valley of Ben Hinnom [ a ] and sacrificed his own sons by burning them in the fire . He did the same terrible sins that the peoples living in that land did . The Lord had forced them out when the Israelites entered that land .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	28	4	Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense in the high places , on the hills , and under every green tree . 5-6 Because Ahaz did these things , the Lord his God let the king of Aram defeat him .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now you plan to keep the people of Judah and Jerusalem as slaves . But you are as guilty as they are for sinning against the Lord your God .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Now listen to me . Send back all those you captured , your own brothers and sisters , because the Lord ’ s terrible anger is against you. ”

ERV	2%20Chronicles	28	23	He offered sacrifices to the gods the people of Damascus worshiped . The people of Damascus had defeated Ahaz . So he thought to himself , “ The gods the people of Aram worship helped them . So if I offer sacrifices to them , maybe they will help me also. ” Ahaz worshiped these gods . In this way he sinned , and he made the people of Israel sin .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	28	24	Ahaz gathered the things from God ’ s Temple and broke them to pieces . Then he closed the doors of the Lord ’ s Temple . He made altars and put them on every street corner in Jerusalem .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They shut the doors of the porch of the Temple and let the fire go out in the lamps . They stopped burning incense and offering burnt offerings in the Holy Place to the God of Israel .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	8	So the Lord became very angry with the people of Judah and Jerusalem . He punished them so badly that it shocks and scares people to hear about it . But then they just laugh and shout their own insults against Judah . You know this is true . You have seen it happen .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	9	That is why our ancestors were killed in battle . Our sons , daughters , and wives were made prisoners .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	10	So now I , Hezekiah , have decided to make an agreement with the Lord , the God of Israel . Then he will not be angry with us anymore .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	11	So my sons , [ b ] don ’ t be lazy or waste any more time . The Lord chose you to serve him in the Temple and to burn incense. ” 12-14 This is a list of the Levites who started to work : From the Kohath family there were Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	19	During the time that Ahaz was king , he rebelled against God . He threw away many of the things that were in the Temple . But we repaired all those things and made them ready for their special use . They are now in front of the Lord ’ s altar. ”

Then they killed the rams and sprinkled the rams ’ blood on the altar .

They did this so that God would forgive the sins of the Israelites . The king said that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all the Israelites .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	26	So the Levites stood ready with David ’ s instruments of music , and the priests stood ready with their trumpets .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar . When the burnt offering began , singing to the Lord also began . The trumpets were blown , and the instruments of David king of Israel were played .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	29	28	All the assembly bowed down , the musicians sang , and the trumpet players blew their trumpets until the burnt offering was finished .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	32	19	Then they insulted the God of Jerusalem just as they had insulted all the gods of the people from other nations—even though those gods are only things people made with their hands .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	32	20	Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this problem . They prayed very loudly to heaven .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	22	Hilkiah and the king ’ s servants [ d ] went to the newer part of Jerusalem to see Huldah the prophetess . She was the wife of Shallum , the son of Tokhath , whose father was Hasrah . Shallum had the job of taking care of the king ’ s clothes . Hilkiah and the king ’ s servants told Huldah what had happened .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	23	Huldah said to them , “ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Tell King Josiah that
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	24	the Lord says , ‘ I will bring trouble to this place and to the people living here . I will bring all the terrible things that are written in the book that was read in front of the king of Judah .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	25	I will do this because the people left me and burned incense to other gods . They made me angry because of all the bad things they have done . So I will pour out my anger on this place . Like a hot burning fire , my anger will not be put out ! ’
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	26	“ Go back to King Josiah of Judah , who sent you to ask what the Lord wants . Tell him , ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says about the words you heard being read :
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	27	. -
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	28	I will take you to be with your ancestors . [ e ] You will go to your grave in peace . You will not have to see any of the trouble that I will bring on this place and on the people living here. ’ ” Hilkiah and the king ’ s servants brought back this message to King Josiah .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	29	Then King Josiah called for all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to come and meet with him .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	30	The king went up to the Lord ’ s Temple . All the people from Judah , the people living in Jerusalem , the priests , the Levites , and all the people , both important and not important , were with Josiah . He read to them all the words in the Book of the Agreement . That book was found in the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	32	Then Josiah made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin promise to accept the agreement . The people of Jerusalem obeyed the agreement of God , the God their ancestors obeyed .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	34	33	The Israelites had idols from many different countries , but Josiah destroyed all the terrible idols . He made all the people in Israel serve the Lord their God . And as long as Josiah was alive , the people continued to serve the Lord , the God of their ancestors . Footnotes -
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	2	Josiah chose the priests to do their duties . He encouraged the priests while they were serving in the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	35	King Josiah celebrated the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem . The Passover lamb was killed on the 14th day of the first month .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	3	He spoke to the Levites who taught the Israelites and who were made holy for service to the Lord . He said to the Levites , “ Put the Holy Box in the Temple that Solomon built . Solomon was David ’ s son . David was king of Israel . Don ’ t carry the Holy Box from place to place on your shoulders again . Now serve the Lord your God and his people , the Israelites .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	4	Make yourselves ready for service in the Temple by your tribes . Do the jobs that King David and his son King Solomon gave you to do .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	5	Stand in the Holy Place with a group of Levites . Do this for each different tribe of the people so that you can help them .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	6	Kill the Passover lambs and make yourselves holy to the Lord . Get ready to help your fellow Israelites . Do everything the Lord commanded us in the laws he gave to Moses. ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	7	Josiah gave the Israelites 30,000 sheep and goats to kill for the Passover sacrifices . He also gave
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	3000	cattle to the people . All these animals were from King Josiah ’ s own animals .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	8	Josiah ’ s officials also freely gave animals and things to the people , to the priests , and Levites to use for the Passover . Hilkiah the high priest , Zechariah , and Jehiel were the officials in charge of the Temple . They gave the priests
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	2600	lambs and goats and
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	300	bulls for Passover sacrifices .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	9	Also Conaniah with Shemaiah and Nethanel , his brothers , and Hashabiah , Jeiel and Jozabad gave
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	500	bulls for Passover sacrifices to the Levites . These men were leaders of the Levites .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	10	When everything was ready for the Passover service to begin , the priests and Levites went to their places . This is what the king commanded .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	11	The Passover lambs were killed . Then the Levites skinned the animals and gave the blood to the priests . The priests sprinkled the blood on the altar .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	12	Then they gave the animals to be used for burnt offerings to the different tribes . This was done so that the burnt offerings could be offered to the Lord the way the Law of Moses taught . And they did the same with the bulls .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	13	The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire in the way they were commanded . And they boiled the holy offerings in pots , kettles , and pans . Then they quickly gave the meat to the people .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	14	After this was finished , the Levites got meat for themselves and for the priests who were descendants of Aaron . These priests were kept very busy , working until it got dark . They worked hard burning the burnt offerings and the fat of the sacrifices .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	15	The Levite singers from Asaph ’ s family got in the places that King David had chosen for them to stand . They were Asaph , Heman , and Jeduthun the king ’ s prophet . The gatekeepers at each gate did not have to leave their places because their brother Levites made everything ready for them for the Passover .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So everything was done that day for the worship of the Lord as King Josiah commanded . The Passover was celebrated and the burnt offerings were offered on the Lord ’ s altar .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	17	The Israelites who were there celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	18	Passover hadn ’ t been celebrated like this since the time of Samuel the prophet ! None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated a Passover like this . King Josiah , the priests , the Levites , and the people of Judah and Israel who were there with all the people in Jerusalem celebrated the Passover in a very special way .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	19	They celebrated this Passover in Josiah ’ s 18th year as king . The Death of Josiah
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	20	Josiah did all these good things for the Temple . Later , King Neco of Egypt led an army to fight against the town of Carchemish on the Euphrates River . King Josiah went out to fight against Neco .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But Neco sent messengers to Josiah . They said , “ King Josiah , this war is not your problem . I didn ’ t come to fight against you . I came to fight my enemies . God told me to hurry . He is on my side , so don ’ t bother me . If you fight against me , God will destroy you ! ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah did not go away . He put on different clothes to hide who he was and went to fight the battle . Josiah refused to listen to the warning Neco had received from God and went to fight on the plain of Megiddo .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	23	Then King Josiah was shot by arrows while he was in the battle . He told his servants , “ Take me away , I am wounded badly ! ”
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	24	So the servants took Josiah out of his chariot and put him in another chariot he had brought with him to the battle . Then they took Josiah to Jerusalem . He died there and was buried in the tombs where his ancestors were buried . All the people of Judah and Jerusalem were very sad because Josiah was dead .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Jeremiah wrote and sang some funeral songs for Josiah . And the men and women singers still sing these sad songs today . It became something the people of Israel always do—they sing a sad song for Josiah . These songs are written in the book , Funeral Songs . 26-27 Everything else Josiah did while he was king , from the beginning to the end of his rule , is written in the book , The History of the Kings of Israel and Judah . The book tells about the way he served God faithfully by obeying the law of the Lord .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	25	years old when he became the new king of Judah . He was king in Jerusalem for eleven years . Jehoiakim did not obey God . He did what the Lord his God considered evil .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	6	King Nebuchadnezzar from Babylon attacked Judah . He made Jehoiakim a prisoner and put bronze chains on him . Then Nebuchadnezzar took King Jehoiakim to Babylon .

ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	18	Nebuchadnezzar carried all the things in God ’ s Temple away to Babylon . He took all the valuable things from the Lord ’ s Temple , from the king , and from the king ’ s officials .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	10	In the spring , King Nebuchadnezzar sent some servants to get Jehoiachin . They brought Jehoiachin and some valuable treasures from the Lord ’ s Temple to Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar chose Zedekiah to be the new king of Judah and Jerusalem . Zedekiah was one of Jehoiachin ’ s relatives . Zedekiah , King of Judah
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	11	Zedekiah was
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	21	The land of Judah became an empty desert and stayed that way for
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	12	Zedekiah did what the Lord his God considered evil . Jeremiah the prophet told him messages from the Lord . But Zedekiah did not humble himself and obey what Jeremiah said . Jerusalem Is Destroyed
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	13	Zedekiah turned against King Nebuchadnezzar . In the past Nebuchadnezzar forced Zedekiah to make a promise to be faithful to him . Zedekiah used God ’ s name and promised to be faithful to Nebuchadnezzar . But Zedekiah was stubborn and would not change his life . He refused to obey the Lord , the God of Israel .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	14	Also , all the leaders of the priests and the leaders of the people of Judah sinned worse and became more unfaithful to the Lord . They followed the evil example of the other nations . They ruined the Temple that the Lord had made holy in Jerusalem .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	15	The Lord , the God of their ancestors , sent prophets again and again to warn his people . He did this because he felt sorry for them and for his Temple . He didn ’ t want to destroy them or his Temple .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But they made fun of God ’ s prophets and refused to listen to them . They hated God ’ s messages . Finally , the Lord could not hold his anger any longer . He became angry with his people and there was nothing that could be done to stop it .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	17	So God brought the king of Babylon to attack the people of Judah and Jerusalem . [ c ] The king of Babylon killed the young men even when they were in the Temple . He didn ’ t have mercy on the people of Judah and Jerusalem . The king of Babylon killed young and old people . He killed men and women . He killed sick and healthy people . God permitted Nebuchadnezzar to punish the people of Judah and Jerusalem .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	19	Nebuchadnezzar and his army burned the Temple . They broke down Jerusalem ’ s wall and burned all the houses that belonged to the king and his officials . They took or destroyed every valuable thing in Jerusalem .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	20	Nebuchadnezzar took the people who were still alive back to Babylon and forced them to be slaves . They stayed in Babylon as slaves until the Persian kingdom defeated the kingdom of Babylon .
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	70	years . All this time the land rested to make up for the Sabbath rests [ d ] that the people had not kept . This is just what the Lord said would happen in the warning he gave through the prophet Jeremiah . [ e ]
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	22	During the first year that Cyrus [ f ] was king of Persia , the Lord caused Cyrus to make a special announcement . He did this so that what the Lord promised through Jeremiah the prophet would really happen . Cyrus sent messengers to every place in his kingdom . They carried this message :

ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	1	talent ” ( 34.5 kg ) . -
ERV	2%20Chronicles	36	586	B.C. , when Jerusalem was finally destroyed by King Nebuchadnezzar from Babylon . -
ERV	Ezra	1	1	During the first year [ a ] that Cyrus was king of Persia , the Lord caused him to make an announcement . It was written down , and Cyrus ordered that it be read throughout his kingdom . This was done so that what the Lord had told Jeremiah [ b ] years before would now happen . This was the announcement :
ERV	Ezra	1	2	From King Cyrus of Persia : The Lord , the God of heaven , gave all the kingdoms on earth to me . And he chose me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in the country of Judah .
ERV	Ezra	1	3	If any of God ’ s people are living among you , I pray God will bless them . You must let them go to Jerusalem in the country of Judah . You must let them go build the Temple of the Lord , the God of Israel , the God who is in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	1	4	And so in any place where there might be survivors of Israel , the men in that place must support these survivors . Give them silver , gold , animals , and other things . Give them gifts for God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	1	5	So the family leaders from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin prepared to go up to Jerusalem . They were going to Jerusalem to build the Lord ’ s Temple . Also everyone who God had encouraged prepared to go to Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	1	6	All their neighbors gave them many gifts . They gave them silver , gold , animals , and other expensive things . Their neighbors freely gave them all those things .
ERV	Ezra	1	7	Also , King Cyrus brought out the things that belonged in the Lord ’ s Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had taken away from Jerusalem . He had put them in his temple where he kept his false gods .
ERV	Ezra	1	8	King Cyrus of Persia told Mithredath , the man who keeps his money , to bring those things out . So Mithredath brought them out to Sheshbazzar , the leader of Judah .
ERV	Ezra	1	9	This is what Mithredath brought out of the Lord ’ s Temple :
ERV	Ezra	1	30	gold bowls ,
ERV	Ezra	1	1000	other dishes .

ERV	Ezra	2	652	""
ERV	Ezra	2	61	From the family of priests there were descendants of Hobaiah , Hakkoz , and Barzillai . ( If a man married a daughter of Barzillai from Gilead , he was counted as a descendant of Barzillai . )
ERV	Ezra	2	62	These people searched for their family histories , but they could not find them . Their names were not included in the list of priests . They could not prove that their ancestors were priests , so they could not serve as priests .
ERV	Ezra	2	63	The governor ordered them not to eat any of the holy food until there was a priest who could use the Urim and Thummim to ask God what to do . 64-65 All together , there were 42,360 people in the group who came back . This is not counting their
ERV	Ezra	2	7337	men and women slaves . They also had
ERV	Ezra	2	200	men and women singers with them . 66-67 They had

ERV	Ezra	2	68	When the group arrived at the place in Jerusalem where the Lord ’ s Temple had been , the family leaders gave their gifts for building this house of God again . They wanted to build it in this same place .
ERV	Ezra	2	69	They gave as much as they were able . These are the things they gave for building the Temple :
ERV	Ezra	2	1100	pounds [ a ] of gold , about
ERV	Ezra	2	100	coats that priests wear .
ERV	Ezra	2	70	So the priests , Levites , and some of the other people moved to Jerusalem and the area around it . This group included the Temple singers , gatekeepers , and the Temple servants . The other Israelites settled in their own hometowns .
ERV	Ezra	3	3	They were afraid of the other people living near them , but that didn ’ t stop them . They built the altar on its old foundation and offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord . They offered sacrifices in the morning and in the evening .
ERV	Ezra	3	2	Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and the priests with him , along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , and the people with him , built the altar of the God of Israel . They built the altar of the God of Israel so that they could offer sacrifices on it . They built it just as it says in the Law of Moses . Moses was God ’ s special servant .
ERV	Ezra	3	4	Then they celebrated the Festival of Shelters just as the Law of Moses said . They offered the right number of burnt offerings for each day of the festival .
ERV	Ezra	3	5	After that they began offering the continual burnt offerings each day and the offerings for the New Moon and all the other festivals that were commanded by the Lord . The people also began giving any other gifts they wanted to give to the Lord .
ERV	Ezra	3	6	So on the first day of the seventh month , these Israelites again began offering sacrifices to the Lord . This was done , even though the Lord ’ s Temple had not been rebuilt . Rebuilding the Temple
ERV	Ezra	3	7	Then those who had come back from captivity gave money to the stonecutters and carpenters . They also gave food , wine , and olive oil . They used these things to pay the people of Tyre and Sidon to bring cedar logs from Lebanon . They wanted to bring the logs in ships to the seacoast town of Joppa as they did for the first Temple . King Cyrus of Persia gave permission for them to do this .
ERV	Ezra	3	8	So in the second month [ b ] of the second year after they came to the Temple in Jerusalem , Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began the work . Their brothers , the priests , Levites , and everyone who came back to Jerusalem from captivity began working with them . They chose Levites who were
ERV	Ezra	3	20	years old and older to be the leaders in the building of the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	Ezra	3	9	These were the men who supervised the work of building the Lord ’ s Temple : Jeshua and his sons , Kadmiel and his sons ( the descendants of Judah ) , the sons of Henadad and their brothers , the Levites .
ERV	Ezra	3	10	The builders finished laying the foundation for the Lord ’ s Temple . When the foundation was finished , the priests put on their special clothing . Then they got their trumpets , and the sons of Asaph got their cymbals . They all took their places to praise the Lord . This was done the way King David of Israel had ordered in the past .
ERV	Ezra	3	11	They sang songs of praise and thanksgiving , taking turns in singing each part . [ c ] They sang , “ The Lord is good . His faithful love will last forever. ” Then all the people cheered—they gave a loud shout and praised the Lord because the foundation of the Lord ’ s Temple had been laid .
ERV	Ezra	3	12	But many of the older priests , Levites , and family leaders , who could remember seeing the first Temple , began to cry aloud . They cried while the others there shouted for joy .
ERV	Ezra	3	13	The sound could be heard far away . All of them made so much noise that no one could tell the difference between the shouts of joy and the crying . Footnotes - Ezra 3:1 seventh month That is , September–October ,

ERV	Ezra	3	536	B.C . - Ezra 3:11 taking turns … part These songs were sung in two parts . One group ( the Levites ) sang the first part and the other group ( the people ) responded with the second part . Here , these are probably Ps . 111-118 and Ps .
ERV	Ezra	3	136	.
ERV	Ezra	4	4	So the enemies began to discourage them and tried to frighten them in order to stop them from building the Temple .
ERV	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel , Jeshua , and the other family leaders of Israel answered , “ No , you people can not help us build a temple for our God . Only we can build the Temple for the Lord . He is the God of Israel . This is what King Cyrus of Persia commanded us to do. ”
ERV	Ezra	4	5	These enemies hired government officials to work against the people of Judah . The officials constantly did things to stop the Jews ’ plans to build the Temple . This continued the whole time that Cyrus was the king until Darius became the king of Persia .
ERV	Ezra	4	6	These enemies even wrote letters to the king of Persia trying to stop the Jews . They wrote a letter the year that Xerxes [ a ] became the king of Persia . Enemies Against Rebuilding Jerusalem
ERV	Ezra	4	7	Later , when Artaxerxes became the new king of Persia , some of these men wrote another letter complaining about the Jews . The men who wrote the letter were Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the other people in their group . The letter was written in Aramaic and translated . [ b ]
ERV	Ezra	4	8	[ c ] Then Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against the people of Jerusalem . They wrote the letter to Artaxerxes the king . This is what they wrote :
ERV	Ezra	4	9	From Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary , and from the judges and important officials over the men from Tripolis , Persia , Erech , and Babylon , and from the Elamites from Susa ,
ERV	Ezra	4	10	and from the other people who the great and powerful Ashurbanipal moved to the city of Samaria and other places in the country west of the Euphrates River .
ERV	Ezra	4	11	This is the copy of the letter sent to King Artaxerxes : From your servants living in the area west of the Euphrates River .
ERV	Ezra	4	12	King Artaxerxes , we wish to inform you that the Jews you sent from there are now in Jerusalem . They are trying to rebuild that terrible city . The people there have always rebelled against other kings . Now they have almost finished repairing the foundations and building the walls . [ d ]
ERV	Ezra	4	13	Also , King Artaxerxes , you should know that if Jerusalem and its walls are rebuilt , the people of Jerusalem will stop paying their taxes . They will stop sending money to honor you . They also will stop paying customs fees , and the king will lose all that money .
ERV	Ezra	4	14	We have a responsibility to the king . We don ’ t want to see this happen , so we are sending this letter to inform the king .
ERV	Ezra	4	15	King Artaxerxes , we suggest that you search the writings of the kings who ruled before you . You will see in the writings that Jerusalem always rebelled against other kings . It has caused much trouble for other kings and nations . Many rebellions have started in this city since ancient times . That is why Jerusalem was destroyed .
ERV	Ezra	4	16	King Artaxerxes , we wish to inform you that if this city and its walls are rebuilt , you will lose control of the area west of the Euphrates River .
ERV	Ezra	4	17	Then King Artaxerxes sent this answer : To Rehum the commanding officer , Shimshai the secretary , and all the people with them living in Samaria and other places west of the Euphrates River . Greetings :
ERV	Ezra	4	18	The letter you sent us has been translated and read to me .
ERV	Ezra	4	19	I gave an order for the writings of the kings before me to be searched . The writings were read , and we found out that Jerusalem has a long history of rebellion against kings . Jerusalem has been a place where rebellion and revolt has happened often .
ERV	Ezra	4	20	Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over it and over the whole area west of the Euphrates River . Their kings received taxes , customs , fees , and tribute .
ERV	Ezra	4	21	Now , you must give an order for these men to stop work . That order must be given to keep Jerusalem from being rebuilt until I say so .
ERV	Ezra	4	22	Be careful not to overlook this matter . We should not let the building of Jerusalem continue . If that work continues , I will not get any more money from Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	4	23	So a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes sent was read to Rehum , Shimshai the secretary , and the people with them . They went very quickly to the Jews in Jerusalem and forced them to stop building . The Work on the Temple Stopped
ERV	Ezra	4	24	So the work stopped [ e ] on God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem . The work did not continue until the second year [ f ] that Darius was king of Persia . Footnotes - Ezra 4:6 Xerxes King of Persia about 485–465 B.C . - Ezra 4:7 The letter … translated Or “ The letter was written in the local language , but with Aramaic characters , and then translated into Aramaic. ” This would mean the scribe used the “ modern ” Aramaic alphabet rather than the older alphabet that was still being used in Judah . - Ezra 4:8 Here , the original language changes from Hebrew to Aramaic . - Ezra 4:12 building the walls This was a way of protecting a city . These men wanted the king to think that the Jews were preparing to rebel against the king . - Ezra 4:24 the work stopped Here , this refers to the time of Xerxes , when work on the Temple was stopped , not to the time of Artaxerxes , when work on the walls around Jerusalem was stopped . - Ezra 4:24 second year That is ,
ERV	Ezra	4	520	B.C .
ERV	Ezra	5	5	But God was watching over the Jewish leaders . The builders didn ’ t have to stop working until a report could be sent to King Darius . They continued working until the king sent his answer back .
ERV	Ezra	5	2	So Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak again started working on the Temple in Jerusalem . All of God ’ s prophets were with them and were supporting the work .
ERV	Ezra	5	3	At that time Tattenai was the governor of the area west of the Euphrates River . Tattenai , Shethar Bozenai , and the men with them went to Zerubbabel , Jeshua , and the others who were building . Tattenai and the people with him asked Zerubbabel and the people with him , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and repair it like new ? ”
ERV	Ezra	5	4	They also asked Zerubbabel , “ What are the names of the men who are working on this building ? ”
ERV	Ezra	5	6	Tattenai the governor of the area west of the Euphrates River , Shethar Bozenai , and the important people with them sent a letter to King Darius .
ERV	Ezra	5	7	This is a copy of that letter : To King Darius . Greetings :
ERV	Ezra	5	8	King Darius , you should know that we went to the province of Judah . We went to the Temple of the great God . The people in Judah are building that Temple with large stones . They are putting big wooden timbers in the walls . The work is being done with much care and the people of Judah are working very hard . They are building very fast ; it will soon be done .
ERV	Ezra	5	9	We asked their leaders some questions about the work they are doing . We asked them , “ Who gave you permission to rebuild this temple and repair it like new ? ”
ERV	Ezra	5	10	We also asked for their names . We wanted to write down the names of their leaders so that you would know who they are .
ERV	Ezra	5	11	This is the answer they gave us : “ We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth . We are rebuilding the Temple that a great king of Israel built and finished many years ago .
ERV	Ezra	5	12	But our ancestors made the God of heaven angry , so God gave our ancestors to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar destroyed this Temple , and he forced the people to go to Babylon as prisoners .
ERV	Ezra	5	13	But , in the first year that Cyrus was king of Babylon , King Cyrus gave a special order for God ’ s Temple to be rebuilt .
ERV	Ezra	5	14	And Cyrus brought out from his false god ’ s temple in Babylon the gold and silver things that were taken from God ’ s Temple in the past . Nebuchadnezzar took them from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought them to his false god ’ s temple in Babylon . Then King Cyrus gave those gold and silver things to Sheshbazzar. ” Cyrus chose Sheshbazzar to be governor .
ERV	Ezra	5	15	Then Cyrus said to Sheshbazzar , “ Take these gold and silver things and put them back in the Temple in Jerusalem . Rebuild God ’ s Temple in the same place it was in the past. ”
ERV	Ezra	5	16	So Sheshbazzar came and built the foundations of God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem . From that day until now , the work has continued , but it is not yet finished .
ERV	Ezra	5	17	Now , if it pleases the king , please search the official records of the king . See if it is true that King Cyrus gave an order to rebuild God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem . And then , sir , please send us a letter to let us know what you have decided to do about this .
ERV	Ezra	6	6	So King Darius sent this message to his officials : To Tattenai , governor of the area west of the Euphrates River , to Shethar Bozenai , and to all the officials living in that province . I order you to stay away from Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	6	2	A scroll was found in the fortress of Ecbatana . ( Ecbatana is in the province of Media . ) This is what was written on that scroll : Official Note :
ERV	Ezra	6	3	During the first year that Cyrus was king , he gave an order about the Temple of God in Jerusalem . The order said : Let the Temple of God be rebuilt . It will be a place to offer sacrifices . Let its foundations be built . The Temple must be
ERV	Ezra	6	60	cubits
ERV	Ezra	6	4	Its wall will be in layers that have three rows of large stones [ b ] and one row of wooden timbers . The cost of building the Temple must be paid for from the king ’ s treasury .
ERV	Ezra	6	5	Also , the gold and silver things from God ’ s Temple must be put back in their places . Nebuchadnezzar took them from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon . They must be put back in God ’ s Temple .
ERV	Ezra	6	7	Don ’ t bother the workers . Don ’ t try to stop the work on this Temple of God . Let the Jewish governor and the Jewish leaders rebuild it . Let them rebuild God ’ s Temple in the same place it was in the past .
ERV	Ezra	6	8	Now I give this order . You must do this for the Jewish leaders building God ’ s Temple : The cost of the building must be fully paid from the king ’ s treasury . The money will come from the taxes collected from the provinces in the area west of the Euphrates River . Do these things quickly , so the work will not stop .
ERV	Ezra	6	9	Give them anything they need . If they need young bulls , rams , or male lambs for sacrifices to the God of heaven , give these things to them . If the priests of Jerusalem ask for wheat , salt , wine , and oil , give these things to them every day without fail .
ERV	Ezra	6	10	Give them to the Jewish priests so that they may offer sacrifices that please the God of heaven . Give these things so that the priests may pray for me and my sons .
ERV	Ezra	6	11	Also , I give this order : If anyone changes this order , a wooden beam must be pulled from their house and pushed through their body . Then their house must be destroyed until it is only a pile of rocks .
ERV	Ezra	6	12	God put his name there in Jerusalem . May God defeat any king or other person who tries to change this order . If anyone tries to destroy this Temple in Jerusalem , may God destroy that person . I , Darius , have ordered it . This order must be obeyed quickly and completely . The Temple Completed and Dedicated
ERV	Ezra	6	13	So Tattenai the governor of the area west of the Euphrates River , Shethar Bozenai , and the men with them obeyed King Darius ’ order . They obeyed the order quickly and completely .
ERV	Ezra	6	14	So the Jewish leaders continued to build . Encouraged by the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo , they had great success . They finished building the Temple as the God of Israel had commanded and as Cyrus , Darius , and Artaxerxes , the kings of Persia , had ordered .
ERV	Ezra	6	15	The Temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar . [ c ] That was in the sixth year of the rule of King Darius . [ d ]
ERV	Ezra	6	16	Then the Israelites celebrated the dedication of God ’ s Temple with much happiness . The priests , the Levites , and all the other people who came back from captivity joined in the celebration .
ERV	Ezra	6	17	This is the way they dedicated God ’ s Temple : They offered
ERV	Ezra	6	100	bulls ,
ERV	Ezra	6	200	rams , and
ERV	Ezra	6	400	male lambs . And they offered twelve male goats for all Israel for a sin offering . That is one goat for each of the twelve tribes of Israel .
ERV	Ezra	6	18	Then they chose the priests in their groups and the Levites in their groups to serve in God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem . They did these things as it is written in the Book of Moses . The Passover
ERV	Ezra	6	19	[ e ] On the fourteenth day of the first month , [ f ] the Jews who came back from captivity celebrated the Passover .
ERV	Ezra	6	20	The priests and Levites made themselves pure . They all made themselves clean and ready to celebrate the Passover . The Levites killed the Passover lamb for all the Jews who came back from captivity . They did that for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
ERV	Ezra	6	21	So all the Israelites who came back from captivity ate the Passover meal . Other people washed themselves and made themselves pure from the unclean things of the people living in that country . These pure people also shared in the Passover meal . They did this so that they could go to the Lord , the God of Israel , for help .
ERV	Ezra	6	22	They celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread with much joy for seven days . The Lord made them very happy because he had changed the attitude of the king of Assyria . [ g ] So the king of Assyria had helped them do the work on God ’ s Temple . Footnotes - Ezra 6:3

ERV	Ezra	7	10	Ezra had always given his time and attention to studying and obeying the law of the Lord . He also loved to teach its rules and commandments to others in Israel . King Artaxerxes ’ Letter to Ezra
ERV	Ezra	7	11	Ezra was a priest and teacher . He knew much about the commands and laws the Lord gave Israel . This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the teacher :
ERV	Ezra	7	12	[ d ] From King Artaxerxes , To Ezra the priest , a teacher of the law of the God of heaven : Greetings !
ERV	Ezra	7	13	I give this order : Any of the Israelites living in my kingdom , including priests and Levites , who want to go with you to Jerusalem , may go .
ERV	Ezra	7	14	I and my seven advisors send you to Judah and Jerusalem . Go and see how your people are doing in obeying the law of your God . You have that law with you .
ERV	Ezra	7	15	I and my advisors are giving gold and silver to the God of Israel , who lives in Jerusalem . You must take this gold and silver with you .
ERV	Ezra	7	16	You must also go through all the provinces of Babylonia . Collect the gifts from your people , from the priests , and from the Levites . The gifts are for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	7	17	Use this money to buy bulls , rams , and male lambs . Buy the grain offerings and drink offerings that go with these sacrifices . Then sacrifice them on the altar in the Temple of your God in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	7	18	Then you and the other Jews may spend the silver and gold left over any way you want to . Use it in a way that is pleasing to your God .
ERV	Ezra	7	19	Take all these things to the God of Jerusalem . They are for the worship in the Temple of your God .
ERV	Ezra	7	20	And you may get any other things that you need for the Temple of your God . Use the money in the king ’ s treasury to buy anything you need .
ERV	Ezra	7	21	Now I , King Artaxerxes , give this order : I order all the men who keep the king ’ s money in the area west of the Euphrates River to give Ezra anything he wants . Ezra is a priest and a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven . Do this quickly and completely .
ERV	Ezra	7	22	Give this much to Ezra :
ERV	Ezra	7	600	gallons Literally , “
ERV	Ezra	7	23	Anything that the God of heaven has ordered for Ezra to get , you must give to Ezra quickly and completely . Do this for the Temple of the God of heaven . We don ’ t want God to be angry with my kingdom or my sons .
ERV	Ezra	7	24	I want you men to know that it is against the law to make the priests , Levites , singers , gatekeepers , Temple servants , and other workers in God ’ s Temple pay taxes . They don ’ t have to pay taxes , money to honor the king , or any customs fees .
ERV	Ezra	7	25	Ezra , I give you the authority to use the wisdom you have from your God and choose civil and religious judges . These men will be judges for all the people living in the area west of the Euphrates River . They will judge all the people who know the laws of your God and they will teach those who don ’ t know those laws .
ERV	Ezra	7	26	Anyone who does not obey the law of your God , or the law of the king , must be punished . Depending on the crime , they must be punished with death , or sent away to another country , or their property taken away , or put into prison . Ezra Praises God
ERV	Ezra	7	27	[ h ] Blessed is the Lord , the God of our ancestors . He put the idea into the king ’ s heart to honor the Lord ’ s Temple in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	7	28	God showed his faithful love to me in front of the king , his advisors , and the king ’ s important officials . The Lord my God was with me , and that gave me courage . I gathered together the leaders of Israel to go with me to Jerusalem . Footnotes - Ezra 7:1 After these things There is a time period of

ERV	Ezra	8	160	other men ;
ERV	Ezra	8	11	from the descendants of Bebai : Zechariah son of Bebai , and
ERV	Ezra	8	28	Then I said to the twelve priests : “ You and these things are holy to the Lord . People gave this silver and gold to the Lord , the God of your ancestors .
ERV	Ezra	8	12	from the descendants of Azgad : Johanan son of Hakkatan , and
ERV	Ezra	8	110	other men ;

ERV	Ezra	8	60	other men ;
ERV	Ezra	8	14	from the descendants of Bigvai : Uthai , Zaccur , and
ERV	Ezra	8	15	I called all these people to meet together at the river that flows toward Ahava . We camped at that place for three days . I learned there were priests in the group , but there were no Levites .
ERV	Ezra	8	16	So I called these leaders : Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan , Jarib , Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah , and Meshullam , and I called Joiarib and Elnathan . ( These men were teachers . )
ERV	Ezra	8	17	I sent the men to Iddo , leader in the town of Casiphia . I told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives , who are the Temple workers in Casiphia . I told the men to ask Iddo and his relatives to send us workers to serve in God ’ s Temple .
ERV	Ezra	8	18	men in all .
ERV	Ezra	8	19	pounds . [ c ] And I gave them two beautiful dishes made from polished bronze that were as valuable as gold .
ERV	Ezra	8	20	gold bowls . The bowls weighed about
ERV	Ezra	8	220	Temple workers whose ancestors had been chosen by David and his officials to help the Levites . The names of all these men were written on the list .
ERV	Ezra	8	21	There near the Ahava River , I announced that we all should fast . We should fast to make ourselves humble before our God . We wanted to ask God for a safe trip for ourselves , our children , and for everything we owned .
ERV	Ezra	8	22	I was embarrassed to ask King Artaxerxes for soldiers and horsemen to protect us as we traveled . There were enemies on the road . The reason I was embarrassed to ask for protection was because of what we had told the king . We had said to King Artaxerxes , “ Our God is with everyone who trusts him , but he is very angry with everyone who turns away from him. ”
ERV	Ezra	8	23	So we fasted and prayed to our God about our trip . He answered our prayers .
ERV	Ezra	8	24	Then I chose twelve of the priests who were leaders . I chose Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brothers .
ERV	Ezra	8	25	tons [ a ] of silver . There were also
ERV	Ezra	8	26	I weighed all these things . There were
ERV	Ezra	8	7500	pounds [ b ] of silver dishes and things . There were
ERV	Ezra	8	27	And I gave them
ERV	Ezra	8	29	So guard these things carefully . You are responsible for them until you give them to the Temple leaders in Jerusalem . You will give them to the leading Levites and the family leaders of Israel . They will weigh them and put them in the rooms of the Lord ’ s Temple in Jerusalem. ”
ERV	Ezra	8	30	So the priests and Levites accepted the silver , gold , and special things that Ezra had weighed and given to them . They were told to take them to God ’ s Temple in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	8	31	On the twelfth day of the first month , [ d ] we left the Ahava River and started toward Jerusalem . God was with us , and he protected us from enemies and robbers along the way .
ERV	Ezra	8	32	Then we arrived in Jerusalem . We rested there for three days .
ERV	Ezra	8	33	On the fourth day , we went to the Temple and weighed the silver , gold , and special things . We gave them to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest . Eleazar son of Phinehas was with Meremoth . The Levites , Jozabad son of Jeshua , and Noadiah son of Binnui were with them also .
ERV	Ezra	8	34	We counted and weighed everything and we wrote down the total weight .
ERV	Ezra	8	35	Then the Jewish people who came back from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel . They offered twelve bulls for all Israel ,
ERV	Ezra	8	96	rams ,
ERV	Ezra	8	77	male lambs , and twelve male goats for a sin offering . All this was a burnt offering to the Lord .
ERV	Ezra	8	36	Then the people gave the letter from King Artaxerxes to the royal satraps and to the governors of the area west of the Euphrates River . Then the leaders gave their support to the Israelites and to the Temple .
ERV	Ezra	9	9	Yes , we were slaves , but you would not let us be slaves forever . You were kind to us . You made the kings of Persia be kind to us . Your Temple was ruined , but you gave us new life so that we can rebuild your Temple and repair it like new . God , you helped us build a wall to protect Judah and Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	9	2	The Israelites have married the people living around us . The Israelites are supposed to be special , but now they are mixed with the other people living around them . The leaders and important officials of the Israelites have set a bad example in this thing. ”
ERV	Ezra	9	3	When I heard about this , I tore my robe and my coat to show I was upset . I pulled hair from my head and beard . I sat down , shocked and upset .
ERV	Ezra	9	4	Then everyone who respected God ’ s Law shook with fear . They were afraid because the Israelites who came back from captivity were not faithful to God . I was shocked and upset . I sat there until the evening sacrifice , and the people gathered around me .
ERV	Ezra	9	5	Then , when it was time for the evening sacrifice , I got up . I had made myself look shameful while I was sitting there . My robe and coat were torn , and I fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the Lord my God .
ERV	Ezra	9	6	Then I prayed this prayer : “ My God , I am too ashamed and embarrassed to look at you . I am ashamed because our sins are higher than our heads . Our guilt has reached all the way up to the heavens .
ERV	Ezra	9	7	We have been guilty of many sins from the days of our ancestors until now . We sinned so our kings and priests were punished . Foreign kings attacked us and took our people away . They took away our wealth and made us ashamed . It is the same even today .
ERV	Ezra	9	8	“ But now , finally , you have been kind to us . You have let a few of us escape captivity and come to live in this holy place . Lord , you gave us new life and relief from our slavery .
ERV	Ezra	9	10	“ Now , God , what can we say to you ? We have stopped obeying you again .
ERV	Ezra	9	11	You used your servants the prophets to give these commands to us . You said , ‘ The land you are going to live in and own is a ruined land . It has been ruined by evil things the people living there have done . They have done very bad things in every place in this land . They have made this land dirty with their sins .
ERV	Ezra	9	12	So Israelites , don ’ t let your children marry their children . Don ’ t join them . Don ’ t want the things they have . Obey my commands so that you will be strong and enjoy the good things of the land . And then you can keep this land and give it to your children. ’
ERV	Ezra	9	13	“ What has happened to us is our own fault . We have done evil things , and we have much guilt . But you , our God , have punished us much less than we should have been . We have done many terrible sins , and we should have been punished worse . And you have even let some of our people escape captivity .
ERV	Ezra	9	14	So we know that we must not break your commands . We must not marry those people . They do very bad things . God , if we continue to marry these bad people , we know you will destroy us . Then there would be no one from the Israelites left alive .
ERV	Ezra	9	15	“ Lord , God of Israel , you are good , and you still have let some of us live . Yes , we are guilty , and because of our guilt , not one of us should be allowed to stand in front of you . ”
ERV	Ezra	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them , “ You people have not been faithful to God . You have married foreign women . You have made Israel more guilty by doing that .
ERV	Ezra	10	2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel , one of the descendants of Elam , spoke to Ezra and said , “ We have not been faithful to our God . We have married the people living around us . But , even though we have done this , there is still hope for Israel .
ERV	Ezra	10	3	Now let us make an agreement before our God to send away all these women and their children . We will do that to follow the advice of Ezra and the people who respect the laws of our God . We will obey God ’ s law .
ERV	Ezra	10	4	Get up , Ezra . This is your responsibility , but we will support you . So be brave and do it. ”
ERV	Ezra	10	5	So Ezra got up . He made the leading priests , the Levites , and all the Israelites promise to do what he said .
ERV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra went away from the front of God ’ s house . He went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib . While Ezra was there , he didn ’ t eat food or drink water . He did that because he was still very sad . He was very sad about the Israelites who came back to Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	10	7	Then he sent a message to every place in Judah and Jerusalem . The message told all the Jewish people who had come back from captivity to meet together in Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezra	10	8	Those who did not come to Jerusalem in three days like the officials and elders said would lose their property and be removed from the group .
ERV	Ezra	10	9	So in three days all the men from the families of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem . And on the twentieth day of the ninth month , [ a ] all the people met together in the Temple yard . They were very upset because of the reason for the meeting and because of the heavy rain .
ERV	Ezra	10	11	Now you must confess your sins to the Lord , the God of your ancestors . You must obey his command . Separate yourselves from the people living around you and from your foreign wives. ”
ERV	Ezra	10	12	Then the whole group who met together answered Ezra . They shouted , “ Ezra , you are right ! We must do what you say .
ERV	Ezra	10	13	But there are many people here . And it is the rainy time of year , so we can not stay outside . This problem can not be solved in a day or two because we have sinned in a very bad way .
ERV	Ezra	10	14	Let our leaders decide for the whole group meeting here . Then let every man in our towns who married a foreign woman come here to Jerusalem at a planned time . Let them come here with the elders and judges of their towns . Then God will stop being angry with us. ”

ERV	Nehemiah	1	1	These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah : I , Nehemiah , was in the capital city of Susa in the month of Kislev . This was in the 20th year [ a ] that Artaxerxes was king .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	2	While I was in Susa , one of my brothers named Hanani and some other men came from Judah . I asked them about the Jews who had escaped captivity and still lived in Judah . I also asked them about the city of Jerusalem .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	3	They answered , “ Nehemiah , the Jews who escaped captivity and are in the land of Judah are in much trouble . They are having many problems and are full of shame because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down , and its gates have been burned with fire. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	1	4	When I heard this about the people of Jerusalem and about the wall , I sat down and cried . I was very sad . I fasted and prayed to the God of heaven for several days .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	5	Then I prayed this prayer : “ Lord , God of heaven , you are the great and powerful God . You are the God who keeps his agreement of love with people who love you and obey your commands .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	6	“ Please open your eyes and ears and listen to the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night . I am praying for your servants , the Israelites . I confess the sins we Israelites have done against you . I am confessing that I have sinned against you and that the other people in my father ’ s family have sinned against you .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	7	We Israelites have been very bad to you . We have not obeyed the commands , rules , and laws you gave your servant Moses .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	8	“ Please remember the teaching you gave your servant Moses . You said to him , ‘ If you Israelites are not faithful , I will force you to be scattered among the other nations .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	9	But if you Israelites come back to me and obey my commands , this is what I will do : Even if your people have been forced to leave their homes and go to the ends of the earth , I will gather them from there . And I will bring them back to the place I have chosen to put my name. ’
ERV	Nehemiah	1	10	“ The Israelites are your servants and your people . You used your great power and rescued them .
ERV	Nehemiah	1	11	So , Lord , please listen to my prayer . And listen to the prayers of all your other servants who are happy to honor you . Help me today as I ask the king for help . Make him pleased with me so that he will be kind and give me what I ask for. ” At that time , I was the king ’ s wine servant . [ b ] Footnotes - Nehemiah 1:1 Kislev … 20th year This was about December ,
ERV	Nehemiah	1	444	B.C . - Nehemiah 1:11 wine servant This important official was always close to the king and tasted the food and wine to make sure they were safe for the king to eat and drink .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	2	So the king asked me , “ Are you sick ? Why do you look sad ? I think your heart is full of sadness. ” Then I was very afraid .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	3	But even though I was afraid , I said to the king , “ May the king live forever ! I am sad because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins , and the gates of that city have been destroyed by fire. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	2	4	Then the king said to me , “ What do you want me to do ? ” Before I answered , I prayed to the God of heaven .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	5	Then I answered the king , “ If it would please the king , and if I have been good to you , please send me to Jerusalem , the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried . I want to go there and rebuild that city. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	2	6	The king and the queen who was sitting next to him asked me , “ How long will your trip take ? When will you get back here ? ” The king was happy to send me , so I gave him a certain time .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	7	I also said to the king , “ If it would please the king to do something else for me , let me ask . Please give me some letters to show the governors of the area west of the Euphrates River . I need these letters so that the governors will give me permission to pass safely through their lands on my way to Judah .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	8	I also need lumber for the heavy wooden beams for the gates , the walls , the walls around the Temple , and my house . So I need a letter from you to Asaph , who is in charge of your forests. ” The king gave me the letters and everything I asked for . The king did that because my God was kind to me .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	9	So I went to the governors of the area west of the Euphrates River and gave them the letters from the king . The king had also sent army officers and soldiers on horses with me .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	10	Sanballat from Horon and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about what I was doing . They were very upset and angry that someone had come to help the Israelites . Nehemiah Inspects the Walls of Jerusalem 11-12 I went to Jerusalem and stayed there three days . Then at night I started out with a few men . I had not said anything to anyone about what my God had put on my heart to do for Jerusalem . There were no horses with me except the horse I was riding .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	13	While it was dark I went out through the Valley Gate . I rode toward the Dragon Well and the Gate of the Ash Piles . I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates in the wall that had been burned with fire .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	14	Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King ’ s Pool . As I got close , I could see there was not enough room for my horse to get through .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	15	So I went up the valley in the dark , inspecting the wall . Finally , I turned back and went back in through the Valley Gate .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	16	The officials and important Israelites didn ’ t know where I had gone . They didn ’ t know what I was doing . I had not yet said anything to the Jews , the priests , the king ’ s family , the officials , or any of the other people who would be doing the work .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	17	Then I said to them , “ You can see the trouble we have here : Jerusalem is a pile of ruins , and its gates have been burned with fire . Come , let ’ s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem . Then we will not be ashamed anymore. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	2	18	I also told them that my God had been kind to me . I told them what the king had said to me . Then they answered , “ Let ’ s start to work , now ! ” So we began this good work .
ERV	Nehemiah	2	19	But Sanballat from Horon , Tobiah the Ammonite official , and Geshem the Arab heard that we were building again . They made fun of us in a very ugly way . They said , “ What are you doing ? Are you turning against the king ? ”
ERV	Nehemiah	2	20	But this is what I said to them : “ The God of heaven will help us succeed . We are God ’ s servants and we will rebuild this city . You can not help us in this work because none of your family lived here in Jerusalem . You don ’ t own any of this land , and you have no right to be in this place. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 2:1 20th year That is ,

ERV	Nehemiah	4	4	Nehemiah prayed and said , “ Our God , listen to our prayer . These men hate us . Sanballat and Tobiah are insulting us . Make bad things happen to them . Make them ashamed , like people taken away as prisoners .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	2	Sanballat talked with his friends and the army at Samaria and said , “ What are these weak Jews doing ? Do they think we will leave them alone ? Do they think they will offer sacrifices ? Maybe they think they can finish building in only one day . They can not bring stones back to life from these piles of trash and dirt . These are just piles of ashes and dirt ! ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	3	Tobiah the Ammonite was with Sanballat . Tobiah said , “ What do these Jews think they are building ? If even a small fox climbed up on it , he would break down their wall of stones ! ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	5	Don ’ t take away their guilt or forgive the sins they have done in your sight . They have insulted and discouraged the builders. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	6	We built the wall of Jerusalem all the way around the city . But it was only half as tall as it should be . We did this much because the people worked with all their heart .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	7	But Sanballat , Tobiah , the Arabs , the Ammonites , and the men from Ashdod were very angry . They heard that the people continued working on the walls of Jerusalem . They heard the people were repairing the holes in the wall .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	8	So all these men got together and made plans against Jerusalem . They planned to stir up trouble against Jerusalem . They planned to come and fight against the city .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	9	But we prayed to our God . And we put guards on the walls to watch day and night so that we could be ready to meet them .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	10	And so at that time the people of Judah said , “ The workers are becoming tired . There is too much dirt and trash in the way . We can not continue to build the wall .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	11	And our enemies are saying , ‘ Before the Jews know it or see us , we will be right there among them . We will kill them and that will stop the work. ’ ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	12	Then the Jews living among our enemies came and said this to us ten times , “ Our enemies are all around us . They are everywhere we turn. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	13	So I put some of the people behind the lowest places along the wall , and I put them by the holes in the wall . I put families together , with their swords , spears , and bows .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	14	After looking over everything , I stood up and spoke to the important families , the officials , and the rest of the people . I said , “ Don ’ t be afraid of our enemies . Remember the Lord , who is great and powerful ! You must fight for your brothers , your sons , and your daughters ! You must fight for your wives and your homes ! ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	15	Then our enemies heard that we knew about their plans . They knew that God ruined their plans . So we all went back to work on the wall . Everyone went back to their own place and did their part .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	16	From that day on , half of my men worked on the wall . The other half of my men were on guard , ready with spears , shields , bows , and armor . The army officers stood behind all the people of Judah who were building the wall .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	17	The builders and their helpers had their tools in one hand and a weapon in the other hand .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	18	Each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked . The man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	19	Then I spoke to the leading families , the officials , and the rest of the people . I said , “ This is a very big job and we are spread out along the wall . We are far from one another .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	20	So if you hear the trumpet , run to that place . We will all meet together there , and our God will fight for us ! ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	21	So we continued to work on the wall of Jerusalem , and half the men held spears . We worked from the first light of the morning until the stars came out at night .
ERV	Nehemiah	4	22	At that time I also said this to the people , “ Every builder and his helper must stay inside Jerusalem at night . Then they can be guards at night and workers during the day. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	4	23	So none of us took off our clothes—not me , not my brothers , not my men , and not the guards . Each of us had our weapon ready at all times , even when we went to get water .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	5	We are as good as the others . Our sons are as good as their sons . But we will have to sell our sons and daughters as slaves . Some of us have already had to sell our daughters as slaves . There is nothing we can do . We have already lost our fields and vineyards . Other people own them now. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	5	2	Some of them were saying , “ We have many children . We must get some grain if we are going to eat and stay alive. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	5	3	Other people were saying , “ This is a time of famine . We have to use our fields , vineyards , and homes to pay for grain. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	5	4	And still other people were saying , “ We have to pay the king ’ s tax on our fields and vineyards . But we can not afford to pay , so we are borrowing money to pay the tax .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	6	When I heard their complaints , I was very angry .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	7	I calmed myself down , and then I went to the rich families and the officials . I told them , “ You are forcing your own people to pay interest on the money you loan them . You must stop doing that ! ” Then I called for all the people to meet together
ERV	Nehemiah	5	8	and said to them , “ Our fellow Jews were sold as slaves to people in other countries . We did our best to buy them back and make them free . And now , you are selling them like slaves again ! ” The rich people and officials kept quiet . They could not find anything to say .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	9	So I continued speaking . I said , “ What you people are doing is not right ! You know that you should fear and respect our God . You should not do the shameful things other people do !
ERV	Nehemiah	5	10	My men , my brothers , and I are also lending money and grain to the people . But let ’ s stop forcing them to pay interest on these loans .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	11	You must give their fields , vineyards , olive fields , and houses back to them , right now ! And you must give back the interest you charged them . You charged them one percent for the money , grain , new wine , and oil that you loaned them. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	5	12	Then the rich people and the officials said , “ We will give it back and not demand anything more from them . Nehemiah , we will do as you say. ” Then I called the priests . I made the rich people and the officials promise to God that they would do what they said .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	13	Then I shook out the folds of my clothes . I said , “ God will do the same thing to everyone who does not keep their promise . God will shake them out of their houses and they will lose everything they worked for . They will lose everything ! ” I finished saying these things and all the people agreed . They all said , “ Amen ” and praised the Lord . So the people did as they had promised .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	14	And also , during the whole time that I was appointed to be governor in the land of Judah , neither my brothers nor I ate the food that was allowed for the governor . I never forced the people to pay taxes to buy my food . I was governor from the 20th year until the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was king . [ a ] I was governor of Judah for twelve years .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	15	But the governors who ruled before me made life hard for the people . The governors forced everyone to pay
ERV	Nehemiah	5	1	pound Literally , “
ERV	Nehemiah	5	16	I worked hard at building the wall of Jerusalem . All my men gathered there to work on the wall . We didn ’ t take any land from anyone .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	17	Also , I regularly fed
ERV	Nehemiah	5	150	Jews who were always welcome at my table , and I fed those who came to us from the nations around us .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	18	Every day I prepared this much food for the people who ate at my table : one ox , six good sheep , and different kinds of birds . Every ten days all kinds of wine were brought to my table . But I never demanded that they give me the food that was allowed for the governor . I knew that the work the people were doing was very hard .
ERV	Nehemiah	5	19	My God , remember all the good I have done for these people . Footnotes - Nehemiah 5:14 the 20th year … king This was from 444–432 B.C . - Nehemiah 5:15

ERV	Nehemiah	6	6	This is what the letter said : “ There is a rumor going around . People are talking about it everywhere . And , by the way , Geshem says it is true . People are saying that you and the Jews are planning to turn against the king . This is why you are building the wall of Jerusalem . People are also saying that you will be the new king of the Jews .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	2	So Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message : “ Come , Nehemiah , let ’ s meet together . We can meet in the town of Kephirim on the plain of Ono. ” But they were planning to hurt me .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	3	So I sent messengers to them with this answer : “ I am doing important work , so I can not come down . I don ’ t want the work to stop just so I can come down and meet with you. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	6	4	Sanballat and Geshem sent the same message to me four times , and I sent the same answer back to them each time .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	5	Then , the fifth time , Sanballat sent his helper to me with the same message . And he had a letter in his hand that was not sealed .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	7	And the rumor is that you have chosen prophets to announce this about you in Jerusalem : ‘ There is a king in Judah ! ’ “ Now I warn you , Nehemiah , King Artaxerxes will hear about this . So come , let ’ s meet and talk about this together. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	6	8	So I sent this answer back to Sanballat : “ Nothing you are saying is happening . You are just making all that up in your own head. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	6	9	Our enemies were only trying to make us afraid . They are thinking to themselves , “ The Jews will be afraid and too weak to keep on working . Then the wall will not be finished. ” But I prayed , “ God , make me strong. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	6	10	One day I went to the house of a man named Shemaiah son of Delaiah . Delaiah was the son of Mehetabel . Shemaiah had to stay in his house . He said , “ Nehemiah , let ’ s meet in God ’ s Temple . Let ’ s go inside the Holy Place [ a ] and lock the doors . Men are coming to kill you . Tonight they are coming to kill you. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	6	11	But I said to Shemaiah , “ Should a man like me run away ? You know that an ordinary man like me can not go into the Holy Place without being put to death . I will not go ! ”
ERV	Nehemiah	6	12	I knew that God had not sent Shemaiah . I knew that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to do that .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	13	They hired Shemaiah to scare me and make me sin by going into that part of the Temple . They were planning those bad things against me so that they could shame me .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	14	My God , please remember Tobiah and Sanballat and the bad things they have done . Also remember the woman prophet Noadiah and the other prophets who have been trying to scare me . The Wall Is Finished
ERV	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall of Jerusalem was completed on the 25th day of the month of Elul . [ b ] It had taken
ERV	Nehemiah	6	52	days to finish building the wall .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	16	Then all our enemies heard that we had completed the wall , and all the nations around us saw that it was finished . So they lost their courage , because they understood that this work had been done with the help of our God .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	17	Also in those days after the wall had been completed , the rich people of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah , and he was answering their letters .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	18	They sent those letters because many people in Judah had promised to be loyal to him . The reason for this is that Tobiah was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah . And Tobiah ’ s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam . Meshullam is the son of Berekiah .
ERV	Nehemiah	6	19	And in the past , those people had made a special promise to Tobiah . So they kept telling me how good Tobiah was . And they kept telling Tobiah what I was doing . Tobiah kept sending me letters to make me afraid .

ERV	Nehemiah	7	7	They returned with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , and Baanah . This is the list of names and numbers of men from Israel who came back :
ERV	Nehemiah	7	2	. - Nehemiah 7:43 Hodeiah Or “ Hodaviah. ” - Nehemiah 7:70
ERV	Nehemiah	7	3	Then I said to Hanani and Hananiah , “ Each day you must wait until the sun has been up for several hours before you open the gates of Jerusalem . You must shut and lock the gates before the sun goes down . Also choose people who live in Jerusalem as guards . Put some of them at special places to guard the city , and put the other people near their own houses. ” The List of Captives Who Returned
ERV	Nehemiah	7	4	Now the city was large and there was plenty of room . But there were few people in it , and the houses had not yet been rebuilt .
ERV	Nehemiah	7	5	So my God put it in my heart to have all the people meet together . I called together all the important people , the officials , and the common people . I did this so that I could make a list of all the families . I found the family lists [ a ] of the people who had been the first to return from captivity . This is what I found written there :
ERV	Nehemiah	7	6	These are the people of the province who came back from captivity . In the past , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took them as prisoners to Babylon . These people came back to Jerusalem and Judah . They all went to their own towns .

ERV	Nehemiah	7	65	The governor ordered them not to eat any of the most holy food until a priest could use the Urim and Thummim to ask God what to do . 66-67 All together , there were 42,360 people in the group who came back . This is not counting their

ERV	Nehemiah	8	8	They read the Book of the Law of God . They made it easy to understand , and explained what it meant . They did this so that the people could understand what was being read .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	2	So Ezra the priest brought the law before those who had met together . This was on the first day of the month . [ a ] It was the seventh month of the year . Men , women , and anyone old enough to listen and understand were at the meeting .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	3	Ezra read in a loud voice from the Book of the Law from early morning until noon . He was facing the open place that was in front of the Water Gate . He read to all the men and women , and to everyone old enough to listen and understand . All the people listened carefully and paid attention to the Book of the Law .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	4	Ezra stood on a high wooden stage . It had been built just for this special time . On his right side stood Mattithiah , Shema , Anaiah , Uriah , Hilkiah , and Maaseiah . And on his left side stood Pedaiah , Mishael , Malkijah , Hashum , Hashbaddanah , Zechariah , and Meshullam .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	5	So Ezra opened the book . All the people could see him because he was standing above them on the high stage . As he opened the Book of the Law , all the people stood up .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	6	Ezra praised the Lord , the great God , and all the people held up their hands and said , “ Amen ! Amen ! ” Then all the people bowed down and put their faces low to the ground and they worshiped the Lord .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	7	These men from the tribe of Levi taught the people about the law as they were all standing there . The Levites were Jeshua , Bani , Sherebiah , Jamin , Akkub , Shabbethai , Hodiah , Maaseiah , Kelita , Azariah , Jozabad , Hanan , and Pelaiah .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	9	Then Nehemiah the governor , Ezra the priest and teacher , and the Levites who were teaching the people spoke . They said , “ Today is a special day [ b ] to the Lord your God . Don ’ t be sad and cry. ” They said that because all the people had begun to cry as they were listening to the messages of God in the law .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	10	Nehemiah said , “ Go and enjoy the good food and sweet drinks . Give some food and drinks to those who didn ’ t prepare any food . Today is a special day to our Lord . Don ’ t be sad , because the joy of the Lord will make you strong. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	8	11	The Levites helped the people to calm down . They said , “ Be quiet , calm down , this is a special day . Don ’ t be sad. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	8	12	Then all the people went to eat the special meal . They shared their food and drinks . They celebrated that special day . They were happy that they could hear the reading of God ’ s law and were now able to understand it .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	13	Then on the second day of the month , [ c ] the leaders of all the families went to meet with Ezra , the priests , and the Levites . They all gathered around Ezra the teacher to study the words of the law . 14-15 They studied and found these commands in the law . The Lord gave this command to the people through Moses : In the seventh month of the year , the Israelites must go to Jerusalem to celebrate a special festival . They must live in temporary shelters . And the people are supposed to go through all of their towns and Jerusalem and say this : “ Go out into the hill country and get branches from different kinds of olive trees . Get branches from myrtle trees , palm trees , and shade trees . Use the branches to make temporary shelters . Do what the law says. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	8	16	So the people went out and got tree branches . Then they built temporary shelters for themselves . They built shelters on their own roofs and in their own yards . And they built shelters in the Temple yard , in the open place near the Water Gate , and near Ephraim Gate .
ERV	Nehemiah	8	17	The whole group that had come back from captivity built shelters . They lived in the shelters they had built . Since the days of Joshua son of Nun up until that day , the Israelites had not celebrated the Festival of Shelters like this . Everyone was very happy !
ERV	Nehemiah	8	18	Ezra read to them from the Book of the Law every day of the festival from the first day of the festival to the last day . The Israelites celebrated the festival for seven days . Then on the eighth day , the people met together for a special meeting , as the law says . Footnotes - Nehemiah 8:2 first day of the month This was a special day of worship . The people met together and shared a fellowship meal . - Nehemiah 8:9 special day The first and second days of each month were special days of worship . The people met together and shared a fellowship meal . - Nehemiah 8:13 second day of the month The first and second days of each month were special days of worship .

ERV	Nehemiah	9	9	You saw our ancestors suffering in Egypt and heard them call for help by the Red Sea .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	2	Those people who were true Israelites separated themselves from foreigners . The Israelites stood and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	3	They stood there for about three hours , and the people read the Book of the Law of the Lord their God . Then for three more hours they confessed their sins and bowed down to worship the Lord their God .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	4	Then these Levites stood on the stairs : Jeshua , Bani , Kadmiel , Shebaniah , Bunni , Sherebiah , Bani , and Kenani . They called out to the Lord their God with loud voices .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	5	Then these Levites spoke again : Jeshua , Bani , Kadmiel , Bani , Hashabneiah , Sherebiah , Hodiah , Shebaniah , and Pethahiah . They said , “ Stand up and praise the Lord your God ! God has always lived and will live forever . “ People should praise your glorious name . May your name be lifted above all blessing and praise .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	6	You are God . Lord , only you are God . You made the sky and the highest heavens and everything in them . You made the earth and everything on it . You made the seas and everything in them . You give life to everything . All the heavenly angels bow down and worship you .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	7	You are the Lord , the God who chose Abram . You led him from Ur in Babylonia . You changed his name to Abraham .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	8	You saw he was true and loyal to you , and you made an agreement with him . You promised to give him the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Jebusites , and Girgashites . But you promised to give that land to Abraham ’ s descendants . And you kept your promise because you are good .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	10	You showed the miracles to Pharaoh . You did amazing things to his officials and his people . You knew that the Egyptians thought they were better than our ancestors . But you proved how great you are , and they remember that even today .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	11	You split the Red Sea in front of them , and they walked through on dry land . The Egyptian soldiers were chasing them , but you threw that enemy into the sea . And they sank like a rock into the sea .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	12	With the tall cloud , you led them by day , and at night you used the column of fire . That is the way you lit their path and showed them where to go .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	13	Then you came down to Mount Sinai . You spoke to them from heaven . You gave them good laws . You gave them true teachings . You gave them laws and commands that were very good .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	14	You told them about your special day of rest—the Sabbath . Through your servant Moses , you gave them commands , laws , and teachings .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	15	They were hungry , so you gave them food from heaven . They were thirsty , so you gave them water from a rock . You told them , ‘ Come , take this land. ’ You used your power , and took the land for them .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	16	But our ancestors became proud and stubborn . They refused to obey your commands .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	17	They refused to listen . They forgot the amazing things you did with them . They became stubborn . They decided to return to Egypt and become slaves again . “ But you are a forgiving God ! You are kind and full of mercy . You are patient and full of love . So you didn ’ t leave them !
ERV	Nehemiah	9	18	You didn ’ t leave them even when they made golden calves and said , ‘ These are the gods that led us out of Egypt. ’
ERV	Nehemiah	9	19	You are very kind , so you didn ’ t leave them in the desert . You didn ’ t take the tall cloud away from them by day . You continued to lead them . You didn ’ t take the column of fire away from them at night . You continued to light their path and to show them which way to go .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	20	You gave them your good Spirit to make them wise . You gave them manna for food . You gave them water for their thirst .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	21	You took care of them for
ERV	Nehemiah	9	40	years . They had all they needed in the desert . Their clothes didn ’ t wear out , and their feet didn ’ t swell and hurt .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	22	You gave them kingdoms and nations , and you gave them faraway places where few people live . They got the land of King Sihon of Heshbon . They got the land of King Og of Bashan .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	23	You made their descendants as many as the stars in the sky . You brought them to the land you promised to give their ancestors . They went in and took that land .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	24	Their children took the land . They defeated the Canaanites living there . You let them defeat those people . You let them do whatever they wanted to those nations , people , and kings .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	25	They defeated powerful cities . They took the fertile land . They got houses filled with good things . They got wells that were already dug . They got vineyards , olive trees , and plenty of fruit trees . They ate until they were full and fat . They enjoyed all the wonderful things you gave them .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	26	And then they turned against you . They threw away your teachings . They killed your prophets . Those prophets warned the people . They tried to bring them back to you . But our ancestors said terrible things against you .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	27	So you let their enemies have them . The enemy caused them much trouble . When trouble came , our ancestors called to you for help . And in heaven , you heard them . You are very kind , so you sent people to save them . And they rescued them from their enemies .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	28	Then as soon as our ancestors were rested , they started doing terrible things again ! So you let the enemy defeat them and punish them . They called to you for help , and in heaven you heard them and helped them . You are so kind . That happened so many times .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	29	You warned them . You told them to come back , but they were too proud . They refused to listen to your commands . If people obey your laws , they will live . But our ancestors broke your laws . They were stubborn . They turned their backs on you . They refused to listen .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	30	“ You were very patient with our ancestors . You let them mistreat you for many years . You warned them with your Spirit . You sent the prophets to warn them . But our ancestors didn ’ t listen . So you gave them to people in other countries .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	31	“ But you are so kind ! You didn ’ t completely destroy them . You didn ’ t leave them . You are such a kind and merciful God !
ERV	Nehemiah	9	32	Our God , you are the great God , the awesome , powerful soldier ! You are kind and loyal . You keep your agreement . We have had many troubles , and our troubles are important to you . Bad things happened to all our people , and to our kings and leaders , and to our priests and prophets . Those terrible things have happened from the days of the king of Assyria until today !
ERV	Nehemiah	9	33	But God , you were right about everything that happened to us . You were right , and we were wrong .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings , leaders , priests , and fathers did not obey your law . They didn ’ t listen to your commands . They ignored your warnings .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	35	Our ancestors didn ’ t serve you even when they were living in their own kingdom . They didn ’ t stop doing evil . They enjoyed all the wonderful things you gave them . They enjoyed the rich land and had plenty of room , but they didn ’ t stop their evil ways .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	36	And now , we are slaves . We are slaves in this land , the land you gave our ancestors so they could enjoy its fruit and all the good things that grow here .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	37	The harvest is big in this land . But we sinned , so that harvest goes to the kings you put over us . They control us and our cattle . They do anything they want . We are in a lot of trouble .
ERV	Nehemiah	9	38	“ Because of all these things , we are making an agreement that can not be changed . We are putting this agreement in writing . Our leaders , Levites , and priests are signing their names to this agreement and sealing it with a seal . ”

All these people promise to follow the law of God . That law of God was given to us through Moses his servant . These people promise with an oath to carefully obey all the commands , rules , and teachings of our Lord God . Now , these are the people who are making this promise : The rest of the people—the priests , Levites , gatekeepers , singers , Temple servants , and all the Israelites who separated themselves from the people living around them . They have separated themselves to obey God ’ s law . Their wives , sons , and daughters who are able to listen and understand also did this . All these people joined their brothers and the important people to accept for themselves the promise to obey God ’ s law . And they accepted the curse that asks for bad things to happen to them if they don ’ t obey God ’ s law .

ERV	Nehemiah	10	33	This money will pay for the special bread that the priests put on the table in the Temple . It will pay for the daily grain offerings and burnt offerings . It will pay for the offerings on the Sabbaths , New Moon celebrations , and other special meeting days . It will pay for the holy offerings and for the sin offerings that make the Israelites pure . It will pay for any work needed on the Temple of our God .
ERV	Nehemiah	10	34	“ We , the priests , the Levites , and the people have thrown lots to decide when each of our families is to bring a gift of wood to the Temple of our God at certain times each year . The wood is to burn on the altar of the Lord our God . We must do that just as it is written in the law .
ERV	Nehemiah	10	35	“ We also accept the responsibility of bringing the first part of our harvest , whether from the grain in our fields or the fruit from our trees . We will bring them to the Lord ’ s Temple each year .
ERV	Nehemiah	10	36	“ Just as it is also written in the law , this is what we will do : We will bring our firstborn sons and our firstborn cattle , sheep , and goats . We will bring these to the Temple of our God , to the priests who are serving there .
ERV	Nehemiah	10	37	“ And we will also bring the first part of our harvest to priests to put in the storage rooms of our God ’ s Temple . We will bring the first of our ground meal , the first of our grain offerings , the first fruit from our trees , and the first of our new wine and oil . And we will bring a tenth of our crops to the Levites , because they are the ones who collect these things in all the towns where we work .
ERV	Nehemiah	10	38	A priest from the family of Aaron must be with the Levites when they receive the crops . Then the Levites must bring the crops to the Temple of our God and put them in the storerooms of the Temple treasury .
ERV	Nehemiah	10	39	The Israelites and the Levites must bring their gifts to the storerooms . They are to bring their gifts of grain , new wine , and oil . All the things for the Temple are kept in the storerooms , and that is where the priests who are on duty stay . The singers and gatekeepers also stay there . “ We all promise that we will take care of the Temple of our God. ” Footnotes - Nehemiah 10:31 seventh year See Ex . 23:10 ,

ERV	Nehemiah	12	23	The family leaders among the descendants of the Levites and up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were written in the history book .

ERV	Nehemiah	12	25	The gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms next to the gates were Mattaniah , Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , and Akkub .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	26	They served in the days of Joiakim . Joiakim was the son of Jeshua , who was the son of Jozadak . And the gatekeepers also served in the days of Nehemiah the governor and in the days of Ezra the priest and teacher . Dedication of the Wall of Jerusalem
ERV	Nehemiah	12	27	The people dedicated the wall of Jerusalem . They brought all the Levites to Jerusalem . The Levites came from the towns they lived in . They came to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem . They came to sing songs of praise and thanks to God . They played their cymbals , harps , and lyres . 28-29 And all the singers also came to Jerusalem . They came from the towns all around Jerusalem . They came from the town of Netophah , from Beth Gilgal , Geba , and Azmaveth . The singers had built small towns for themselves in the area around Jerusalem .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	30	So the priests and Levites made themselves pure in a ceremony . Then they also made the people , the gates , and the wall of Jerusalem pure in a ceremony .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	31	I told the leaders of Judah to go up and stand on top of the wall . I also chose two large singing groups to give thanks to God . One group was to start going up on top of the wall on the right side , toward the Ash Pile Gate .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	32	Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed the singers .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	33	Also following them were Azariah , Ezra , Meshullam ,
ERV	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah , Benjamin , Shemaiah , and Jeremiah .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	35	And some of the priests with trumpets also followed them up to the wall . Zechariah also followed them . ( Zechariah was the son of Jonathan , who was the son of Shemaiah , who was the son of Mattaniah , who was the son of Micaiah , who was the son of Zaccur , who was the son of Asaph . )
ERV	Nehemiah	12	36	There were also Asaph ’ s brothers , who were Shemaiah , Azarel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethanel , Judah , and Hanani . They had the musical instruments that David , the man of God , had made . Ezra the teacher led the group of people who were there to dedicate the wall .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	37	They went to the Fountain Gate and walked up the stairs all the way to the City of David . They were on top of the city wall . They walked over the house of David and went toward the Water Gate .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	38	The second group of singers started out in the other direction , to the left . I followed them as they went up to the top of the wall . Half of the people also followed them . They went past the Tower of Ovens to the Broad Wall .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	39	Then they went over these gates : the Gate of Ephraim , the Old Gate , and the Fish Gate . And they went over the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred . They went as far as the Sheep Gate and stopped at the Guard Gate .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	40	Then the two singing groups went to their places in God ’ s Temple . And I stood in my place . And half the officials stood in their places in the Temple .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	41	Then these priests stood in their places : Eliakim , Maaseiah , Mijamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , and Hananiah . These priests had their trumpets with them .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	42	Then these priests stood in their places in the Temple : Maaseiah , Shemaiah , Eleazar , Uzzi , Jehohanan , Malkijah , Elam , and Ezer . Then two singing groups began singing with Jezrahiah leading them .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	43	So on that special day , the priests offered many sacrifices . Everyone was very happy because God had made them happy . Even the women and children were excited and happy . People far away could hear the happy sounds coming from Jerusalem .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	44	Men were chosen to be in charge of the storerooms on that day . People brought the first part of the harvest and a tenth of their crops . So the men in charge put these things in the storerooms . The Jewish people were very happy about the priests and Levites on duty . So they brought many things to be put in the storerooms .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	45	The priests and Levites did their work for their God . They did the ceremonies that made people pure , and the singers and gatekeepers did their part . They did everything that David and Solomon had commanded .
ERV	Nehemiah	12	46	( Long ago , in the days of David , Asaph had been the director . And he had many songs of praise and thanks to God . )
ERV	Nehemiah	12	47	So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah , all the Israelites gave every day to support the singers and gatekeepers . The people also set aside the money for the other Levites . And the Levites set aside the money for the descendants of Aaron .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	13	I put these men in charge of the storerooms : Shelemiah the priest , Zadok the teacher , and a Levite named Pedaiah . And I made Hanan son of Zaccur , son of Mattaniah , their helper . I knew I could trust these men . They were responsible for giving the supplies to their relatives .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	2	That law was written because those people didn ’ t give the Israelites food and water . And they had paid Balaam to say a curse against the Israelites . But our God changed that curse and made it a blessing for us .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	3	So when the Israelites heard that law , they obeyed it . They separated themselves from the people who were descendants of foreigners . 4-5 But , before that happened , Eliashib had given a room in the Temple to Tobiah . Eliashib was the priest in charge of the storerooms in our God ’ s Temple . And he was a close friend of Tobiah . That room had been used for storing the grain offerings , incense , and the Temple dishes and things . They also kept the tenth of grain , new wine , and oil for the Levites , singers , and gatekeepers in that room . And they also kept the gifts for the priests in that room . But Eliashib gave that room to Tobiah .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	6	I was not in Jerusalem while all of this was happening . I had gone back to the king of Babylon . I went back to Babylon in the 32nd year that Artaxerxes was king of Babylon . [ a ] Later , I asked the king for permission to go back to Jerusalem .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	7	So I came back to Jerusalem . There I heard about the sad thing that Eliashib had done . He had given Tobiah a room in the Temple of God !
ERV	Nehemiah	13	8	I was very angry about what Eliashib had done , so I threw all of Tobiah ’ s things out of the room .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	9	I gave commands for the rooms to be made pure and clean . Then I put the Temple dishes and things , the grain offerings , and the incense back into the rooms .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	10	I also heard that the people had not given the Levites their share . So the Levites and singers had gone back to work in their own fields .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	11	So I told the officials that they were wrong . I asked them , “ Why didn ’ t you take care of God ’ s Temple ? ” Then I called all Levites together and told them to go back to their places and duties in the Temple .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	12	Then everyone in Judah brought their tenth of grain , new wine , and oil to the Temple . These things were put into the storerooms .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	14	My God , please remember me for these things I have done . Don ’ t forget all I have faithfully done for the Temple of my God and for its services .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days in Judah , I saw people working on the Sabbath day . I saw people pressing grapes to make wine . I saw people bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys . I saw people carrying grapes , figs , and all kinds of things in the city . They were bringing all these things into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day , so I warned them about this . I told them they must not sell food on the Sabbath day .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	16	There were some men from the city of Tyre living in Jerusalem . They were bringing fish and all kinds of things into Jerusalem and selling them on the Sabbath day . And the Jews were buying them .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	17	I told the important people of Judah that they were wrong . I said , “ You are doing a very bad thing . You are ruining the Sabbath day .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	18	You know that your ancestors did the same things . That is why our God brought all the troubles and disaster to us and to this city . Now you people are making it so that more of these bad things will happen to Israel . They are doing this because you are breaking the Sabbath by treating it just as if it were any other day. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	13	19	So this is what I did : Every Friday evening , just before dark , I commanded the gatekeepers to shut and lock the gates to Jerusalem . They were not to be opened until the Sabbath day was over . I put some of my own men at the gates . They were commanded to make sure that no load was brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	20	One or two times , traders and merchants had to stay the night outside Jerusalem .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	21	But I warned them , “ Don ’ t stay the night in front of the wall . If you do that again , I will arrest you. ” So from that time on they didn ’ t come on the Sabbath day to sell their things .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	22	Then I commanded the Levites to make themselves pure . After they did that , they were to go and guard the gates . This was done to make sure the Sabbath day was kept a holy day . My God , please remember me for doing this . Be kind to me and show me your great love !
ERV	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days I also noticed that some Jewish men had married women from the countries of Ashdod , Ammon , and Moab .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	24	And half of the children from those marriages didn ’ t know how to speak the Jewish language . They spoke the language of Ashdod , Ammon , or Moab .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	25	So I told the men that they were wrong . I said bad things to them . I hit some of them , and I pulled out their hair . I forced them to make a promise in God ’ s name . I said to them , “ You must not marry the daughters of these foreigners . Don ’ t let their daughters marry your sons , and don ’ t let your daughters marry the sons of these foreigners .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	26	You know that marriages like this caused Solomon to sin . In all the many nations , there was not a king as great as Solomon . God loved him and made him king over the whole nation of Israel . But even Solomon was made to sin because of foreign women .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	27	And now , we hear that you also are doing this terrible sin . You are not being true to our God . You are marrying foreign women. ”
ERV	Nehemiah	13	28	Joiada was the son of Eliashib the high priest . One of Joiada ’ s sons was a son-in-law of Sanballat from Horon . I forced him to leave this place . I forced him to run away .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	29	My God , punish these people . They made the priesthood unclean . They treated it as if it was not important . They did not obey the agreement that you made with the priests and Levites .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	30	So I made the priests and Levites clean and pure . I took away all the foreigners and the strange things they taught . And I gave the Levites and priests their own duties and responsibilities .
ERV	Nehemiah	13	31	And I made sure that people will bring gifts of wood and the first part of their harvest at the right times . My God , remember me for doing these good things . Footnotes - Nehemiah 13:6 the 32nd year … Babylon That is ,
ERV	Nehemiah	13	432	B.C .
ERV	Esther	1	1	This is what happened during the time when Xerxes [ a ] was king . Xerxes ruled over the
ERV	Esther	1	127	provinces from India to Ethiopia .
ERV	Esther	1	2	King Xerxes ruled from his throne in the capital city of Susa .
ERV	Esther	1	3	In the third year of Xerxes ’ rule , he gave a party for his officers and leaders . The army leaders and important leaders from all of Persia and Media were there .
ERV	Esther	1	4	The party continued for
ERV	Esther	1	180	days were over , King Xerxes gave another party that continued for seven days . It was held in the inside garden of the palace . All the people who were in the capital city of Susa were invited , from the most important to the least important .
ERV	Esther	1	5	And when the
ERV	Esther	1	6	The inside garden had white and blue linen hangings around the room . They were held in place with cords of white linen and purple material on silver rings and marble pillars . There were couches made of gold and silver . They were sitting on mosaic pavement made of porphyry , [ b ] marble , mother-of-pearl , and other expensive stones .
ERV	Esther	1	7	Wine was served in golden cups , and every cup was different . There was plenty of the king ’ s wine , because the king was very generous .
ERV	Esther	1	8	The king had given a command to his servants . He told them that each guest must be given as much wine as he wanted , and the wine server obeyed the king .
ERV	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a party for the women in the king ’ s palace . 10-11 On the seventh day of the party , King Xerxes was in high spirits from drinking wine . He gave a command to the seven eunuchs who served him . The eunuchs were Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas . He commanded them to bring Queen Vashti to him wearing her royal crown . She was to come so that she could show her beauty to the leaders and important people . She was very beautiful .
ERV	Esther	1	12	But when the eunuchs told Queen Vashti about the king ’ s command , she refused to come . Then the king was very angry . 13-14 It was the custom for the king to ask the advice of the experts about the law and punishments . So King Xerxes spoke with the wise men who understood the laws . They were very close to the king . Their names were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , and Memucan . They were the seven most important officials of Persia and Media . They had special privileges to see the king . They were the highest officials in the kingdom .
ERV	Esther	1	15	The king asked them , “ What does the law say must be done to Queen Vashti ? She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs had taken to her. ”
ERV	Esther	1	16	Then Memucan answered the king with the other officials listening , “ Queen Vashti has done wrong . She has done wrong against the king and also against all the leaders and people of all the provinces of King Xerxes .
ERV	Esther	1	17	I say this , because all the other women will hear about what Queen Vashti did . Then they will stop obeying their husbands . They will say to their husbands , ‘ King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought to him , but she refused to come. ’
ERV	Esther	1	18	“ Today the wives of the Persian and Median leaders have heard what the queen did , and these women will be influenced by what she did . They will do the same thing to the king ’ s important leaders . And there will be plenty of disrespect and anger .
ERV	Esther	1	19	“ So if it pleases the king , here is a suggestion : Let the king give a royal command and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media . The laws of Persia and Media can not be changed . The royal command should be that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes . Let the king also give her royal position to someone else who is better than she is .
ERV	Esther	1	20	Then when the king ’ s command is announced in all parts of his large kingdom , all the women will respect their husbands . From the most important to the least important , all the women will respect their husbands. ”
ERV	Esther	1	21	The king and his important officials were happy with this advice , so King Xerxes did as Memucan suggested .
ERV	Esther	1	22	King Xerxes sent letters to all parts of the kingdom . He sent them to each province , written in its own language . He sent them to each nation in its own language . These letters announced in each person ’ s language that every man was to be the ruler over his own family . Footnotes - Esther 1:1 Xerxes Hebrew , “ Ahasuerus. ” He was king of Persia about 485-465 B.C . - Esther 1:6 porphyry A dark red or purple stone .
ERV	Esther	2	2	Then the king ’ s personal servants had a suggestion . They said , “ Search for beautiful young virgins for the king .
ERV	Esther	2	3	Let the king choose leaders in every province of his kingdom . Then let the leaders bring every beautiful young virgin to the capital city of Susa . These young women will be put with the group of the king ’ s women . They will be under the care of Hegai , the king ’ s eunuch , who is in charge of the women . Then give beauty treatments to all of them .
ERV	Esther	2	4	Then let the one who is pleasing to the king become the new queen in Vashti ’ s place. ” The king liked this suggestion , so he accepted it .
ERV	Esther	2	5	Now there was a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai . Mordecai was the son of Jair , and Jair was the son of Shimei , and Shimei was the son of Kish . Mordecai was in the capital city , Susa .
ERV	Esther	2	6	Mordecai had been carried into captivity from Jerusalem by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . He was with the group that was taken into captivity with King Jehoiachin of Judah .
ERV	Esther	2	7	Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah . She didn ’ t have a father or a mother , so Mordecai took care of her . Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter when her father and mother died . Hadassah was also called Esther . She had a very pretty face and a good figure .
ERV	Esther	2	8	When the king ’ s command had been heard , many young women were brought to the capital city of Susa . They were put under the care of Hegai . Esther was one of these women . She was taken to the king ’ s palace and put into Hegai ’ s care . Hegai was in charge of the king ’ s women .
ERV	Esther	2	9	He liked Esther . She became his favorite , so he quickly gave Esther beauty treatments and special food . He chose seven slave women from the king ’ s palace and gave them to Esther . Then he moved Esther and her seven women servants into the best place where the king ’ s women lived .
ERV	Esther	2	10	Esther didn ’ t tell anyone she was a Jew . She didn ’ t tell anyone about her family background , because Mordecai had told her not to .
ERV	Esther	2	11	Every day Mordecai walked back and forth near the area where the king ’ s women lived . He did this because he wanted to find out how Esther was , and what was happening to her .
ERV	Esther	2	12	Before a young woman could take her turn to go in before King Xerxes , she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments—six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics .
ERV	Esther	2	13	When her time came to go in to the king , she could choose to wear or take whatever she wanted from the women ’ s living area .
ERV	Esther	2	14	In the evening the young woman would go to the king ’ s palace . And in the morning she would return to another area where the king ’ s women lived . Then she would be placed under the care of a man named Shaashgaz . He was the king ’ s eunuch in charge of the slave women . She would not go back to the king again unless he was pleased with her . Then he would call her by name to come back to him .
ERV	Esther	2	15	The time came for Esther to go to the king . She was the one Mordecai had adopted , the daughter of his uncle Abihail . All she wanted to take with her was what Hegai , the king ’ s officer in charge of the women , suggested . Everyone who saw Esther liked her .
ERV	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to King Xerxes in the palace . This happened in the tenth month , the month of Tebeth , in the seventh year of his rule .
ERV	Esther	2	17	The king loved Esther more than any of the other young women , and she became his favorite . He approved of her more than any of the others . So King Xerxes put a crown on Esther ’ s head and made her the new queen in place of Vashti .
ERV	Esther	2	18	And the king gave a big party for Esther . It was for all his important people and leaders . He announced a festival in all the provinces and sent out gifts to people , because he was a generous king . Mordecai Learns About an Evil Plan
ERV	Esther	2	19	Mordecai was sitting next to the king ’ s gate at the time the young women were gathered together the second time .
ERV	Esther	2	20	Esther had still kept it a secret that she was a Jew . She had not told anyone about her family background . This is what Mordecai had told her to do . She still obeyed Mordecai just as she had done when he was taking care of her .
ERV	Esther	2	21	During the time Mordecai was sitting next to the king ’ s gate , this happened : Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king ’ s officers who guarded the doorway , became angry with the king . They began to make plans to kill King Xerxes .
ERV	Esther	2	22	But Mordecai learned about these plans and told Queen Esther . Then she told the king . She also told him that Mordecai was the one who had learned about the evil plan .
ERV	Esther	2	23	Then the report was checked out . It was learned that Mordecai ’ s report was true . The two guards who had planned to kill the king were hanged on a post . All these things were written down in a book of the king ’ s histories in front of the king .
ERV	Esther	3	3	Then the king ’ s leaders at the gate asked Mordecai , “ Why don ’ t you obey the king ’ s command to bow down to Haman ? ”
ERV	Esther	3	2	All the king ’ s leaders at the king ’ s gate would bow down and give honor to Haman . This is what the king commanded them to do . But Mordecai refused to bow down or give honor to Haman .
ERV	Esther	3	4	Day after day , the king ’ s leaders spoke to Mordecai , but he refused to obey the command to bow down to Haman . So they told Haman about it . They wanted to see what Haman would do about Mordecai . Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew .
ERV	Esther	3	5	When Haman saw that Mordecai refused to bow down to him or give him honor , he was very angry .
ERV	Esther	3	6	Haman had learned that Mordecai was a Jew . But he was not satisfied to kill only Mordecai . He also wanted to find a way to destroy all of Mordecai ’ s people , the Jews , in all of Xerxes ’ kingdom .
ERV	Esther	3	7	In the twelfth year of King Xerxes ’ rule , in the first month , the month of Nisan , Haman threw lots to choose a special day and month . And the twelfth month , the month of Adar was chosen . ( At that time the lot was called “ pur. ” )
ERV	Esther	3	8	Then Haman came to King Xerxes and said , “ King Xerxes , there is a certain group of people scattered among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom . They keep themselves separate from other people . Their customs are different from those of all other people . And they don ’ t obey the king ’ s laws . It is not right for the king to allow them to continue to live in your kingdom .
ERV	Esther	3	9	“ If it pleases the king , I have a suggestion : Give a command to destroy these people . And I will put 750,000 pounds [ a ] of silver into the king ’ s treasury . This money could be used to pay the men who do these things. ”
ERV	Esther	3	10	So the king took the official ring off his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite . Haman was the enemy of the Jews .
ERV	Esther	3	11	Then the king said to Haman , “ Keep the money . Do what you want with them. ”
ERV	Esther	3	12	Then on the 13th day of the first month , the king ’ s secretaries were called . They wrote out all of Haman ’ s commands in the language of each province . And they wrote them in the language of each group of people . They wrote to the king ’ s satraps , the governors of the different provinces , and the leaders of the different groups of people . They wrote with the authority of King Xerxes himself , and sealed the commands with the king ’ s own ring .
ERV	Esther	3	13	Messengers carried the letters to all the king ’ s provinces . The letters were the king ’ s command to ruin , kill , and completely destroy all the Jews . This meant young people and old people , women , and little children too . The command was to kill all the Jews on a single day . The day was to be the 13th day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar . And the command was to take everything that belonged to the Jews .
ERV	Esther	3	14	A copy of the letters with the command was to be given as a law . It was to be a law in every province and announced to the people of every nation living in the kingdom . Then everyone would be ready for that day .
ERV	Esther	3	15	At the king ’ s command the messengers hurried off . The command was given in the capital city of Susa . The king and Haman sat down to drink , but the city of Susa was in confusion . Footnotes - Esther 3:9 750,000 pounds Literally , “ 10,000 talents ” ( 340,000 kg ) .
ERV	Esther	4	4	Esther ’ s slave women and eunuchs came to her and told her about Mordecai . This made Queen Esther very sad and upset . She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on instead of the sackcloth , but he would not accept them .
ERV	Esther	4	2	But Mordecai went only as far as the king ’ s gate . No one was allowed to enter the gate dressed in sackcloth .
ERV	Esther	4	3	In every province where the king ’ s command had come , there was much crying and sadness among the Jews . They were fasting and crying loudly . Many Jews were lying on the ground dressed in sackcloth with ashes on their heads .
ERV	Esther	4	5	Then Esther called Hathach , one of the king ’ s eunuchs who had been chosen to serve her . She commanded him to find out what was bothering Mordecai , and why .
ERV	Esther	4	6	So Hathach went out to where Mordecai was in the open place of the city in front of the king ’ s gate .
ERV	Esther	4	7	Then Mordecai told Hathach everything that had happened to him . Mordecai told him about the exact amount of money Haman had promised to put into the king ’ s treasury for killing Jews .
ERV	Esther	4	8	Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the king ’ s command to kill the Jews . The command had been sent out all over the city of Susa . He wanted Hathach to show it to Esther and tell her everything . And he told him to encourage Esther to go to the king and beg him for mercy for Mordecai and her people .
ERV	Esther	4	9	Hathach went back and told Esther everything Mordecai had said .
ERV	Esther	4	10	Then Esther told Hathach to say this to Mordecai :
ERV	Esther	4	11	“ Mordecai , all the king ’ s leaders and all the people of the king ’ s provinces know this : The king has one law for any man or woman who goes to the king without being called . That person must be put to death unless the king holds out his gold scepter to them . If the king does this , that person ’ s life will be saved . And I have not been called to go see the king for
ERV	Esther	4	30	days. ” 12-13 Then Esther ’ s message was given to Mordecai . When he got her message , Mordecai sent his answer back : “ Esther , don ’ t think that just because you live in the king ’ s palace you will be the only Jew to escape .
ERV	Esther	4	14	If you keep quiet now , help and freedom for the Jews will come from another place . But you and your father ’ s family will all die . And who knows , maybe you have been chosen to be the queen for such a time as this. ” 15-16 Then Esther sent this answer to Mordecai : “ Mordecai , go and get all the Jews in Susa together , and fast for me . Don ’ t eat or drink for three days and nights . I and my women servants will fast too . After we fast , I will go to the king . I know it is against the law to go to the king if he didn ’ t call me , but I will do it anyway . If I die , I die. ”
ERV	Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went away and did everything Esther told him to do .
ERV	Esther	5	5	Then the king said , “ Bring Haman quickly so that we may do what Esther asks. ” So the king and Haman went to the party Esther had prepared for them .
ERV	Esther	5	2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court , he was very pleased . He held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand . So Esther went in to the room and went near the king . Then she touched the end of the king ’ s gold scepter .
ERV	Esther	5	3	Then the king asked , “ What is bothering you Queen Esther ? What do you want to ask me ? I will give you anything you ask for , even half my kingdom. ”
ERV	Esther	5	4	Esther said , “ I have prepared a party for you and Haman . Will you and Haman please come to the party today ? ”
ERV	Esther	5	6	While they were drinking wine , the king asked her again , “ Now Esther , what do you want to ask for ? Ask for anything , I will give it to you . So what is it you want ? I will give you anything you want , up to half my kingdom. ”
ERV	Esther	5	7	Esther answered , “ This is what I want to ask for :
ERV	Esther	5	8	If the king is pleased with me and thinks it good to give me what I ask for , let the king and Haman come tomorrow . I will prepare another party for them . Then I will tell what I really want. ” Haman ’ s Anger at Mordecai
ERV	Esther	5	9	Haman left the king ’ s palace that day very happy and in a good mood . But when he saw Mordecai at the king ’ s gate , he became very angry . Haman was very mad at him because Mordecai didn ’ t show any respect when Haman walked by . Mordecai was not afraid of Haman , and this made Haman mad .
ERV	Esther	5	10	But Haman controlled his anger and went home . Then Haman called together his friends and his wife , Zeresh .
ERV	Esther	5	11	Haman started bragging about how rich he was . He was bragging to his friends about his many sons , and about all the ways the king had honored him . And he was bragging about how the king had promoted him higher than all the other leaders .
ERV	Esther	5	12	“ And that ’ s not all , ” Haman added . “ I ’ m the only one Queen Esther invited to be with the king at the party she gave . And the Queen also has invited me to be with the king again tomorrow .
ERV	Esther	5	13	But all this means nothing to me . I can not be happy as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king ’ s gate. ”
ERV	Esther	5	14	Then Haman ’ s wife Zeresh and all his friends had a suggestion . They said , “ Tell someone to build a post to hang him on . Make it
ERV	Esther	5	75	feet Literally , “
ERV	Esther	5	50	cubits ” (
ERV	Esther	5	22	m ) .
ERV	Esther	6	6	When Haman came in , the king asked him a question . He said , “ Haman , what should be done for a man the king wants to honor ? ” Haman thought to himself , “ Who is there that the king would want to honor more than me ? I ’ m sure that the king is talking about honoring me. ”
ERV	Esther	6	2	The servant read the book to the king . He read about the evil plan to kill King Xerxes . That was when Mordecai had learned about Bigthana and Teresh . These two men were the king ’ s officers who guarded the doorway . They had planned to kill the king , but Mordecai learned about the plan and told someone about it .
ERV	Esther	6	3	Then the king asked , “ What honor and good things have been given to Mordecai for this ? ” The servants answered the king , “ Nothing has been done for Mordecai. ”
ERV	Esther	6	4	Haman had just entered the outer area of the king ’ s palace . He had come to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the hanging post Haman had commanded to be built . The king said , “ Who just came into the courtyard ? ”
ERV	Esther	6	5	The king ’ s servants said , “ Haman is standing in the courtyard. ” So the king said , “ Bring him in. ”
ERV	Esther	6	7	So Haman answered the king , “ Do this for the man the king loves to honor :
ERV	Esther	6	8	Have the servants bring a special robe the king himself has worn and a horse the king himself has ridden . Have the servants put the king ’ s special mark on the horse ’ s head .
ERV	Esther	6	9	Then put one of the king ’ s most important leaders in charge of the robe and the horse , and let the leader put the robe on the man the king wants to honor . Then let him lead him on the horse through the city streets . As he leads him , let him announce , ‘ This is done for the man the king wants to honor ! ’ ”
ERV	Esther	6	10	“ Go quickly , ” the king commanded Haman . “ Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew . He is sitting near the king ’ s gate . Do everything that you suggested. ”
ERV	Esther	6	11	So Haman got the robe and the horse . Then he put the robe on Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city streets . Haman announced ahead of Mordecai , “ This is done for the man the king wants to honor ! ”
ERV	Esther	6	12	After that Mordecai went back to the king ’ s gate , but Haman hurried home with his head covered because he was embarrassed and ashamed .
ERV	Esther	6	13	Then Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him . His wife and the men who gave him advice said , “ If Mordecai is a Jew , you can not win . You have already started to fall . Surely you will be ruined ! ”
ERV	Esther	6	14	While they were still talking to Haman , the king ’ s eunuchs came to Haman ’ s house . They made Haman hurry to the party that Esther had prepared .
ERV	Esther	7	7	The king was very angry . He got up , left his wine , and went out into the garden . But Haman stayed inside to beg Queen Esther to save his life . He begged for his life because he knew that the king had already decided to kill him .
ERV	Esther	7	2	Then as they were drinking wine on the second day of the party , the king again asked Esther a question , “ Queen Esther , what is it you want to ask for ? Ask anything and it will be given to you . What do you want ? I will give you anything , even half my kingdom. ”
ERV	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered , “ King , if you like me and it pleases you , please let me live . And I ask you to let my people live too . This is what I ask for .
ERV	Esther	7	4	I ask this because my people and I have been sold to be destroyed—to be killed and wiped out completely . If we had just been sold as slaves , I would have kept quiet , because that would not be enough of a problem to bother the king. ”
ERV	Esther	7	5	Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther , “ Who did this to you ? Where is the man who dared to do such a thing to your people ? ”
ERV	Esther	7	6	Esther said , “ The man against us , our enemy , is this wicked Haman. ” Then Haman was filled with terror before the king and queen .
ERV	Esther	7	8	Just as the king was coming back in from the garden to the party room , he saw Haman falling on the couch where Esther was lying . The king said with anger in his voice , “ Will you attack the queen even while I am in the house ? ” As soon as the king had said this , servants came in and killed Haman . [ a ]
ERV	Esther	7	9	One of the eunuchs who served the king was named Harbona . He said , “ A hanging post
ERV	Esther	7	75	feet Literally , “
ERV	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the hanging post he had built for Mordecai . Then the king stopped being angry . Footnotes - Esther 7:8 killed Haman Literally , “ covered Haman ’ s face. ” - Esther 7:9
ERV	Esther	7	50	cubits ” (
ERV	Esther	7	22	m ) .
ERV	Esther	8	8	Now write another command by the authority of the king . Write it to help the Jews in a way that seems best to you . Then seal the order with the king ’ s special ring . No official letter written by the authority of the king and sealed with the king ’ s ring can be canceled. ”
ERV	Esther	8	2	The king had gotten his ring back from Haman . The king took the ring off his finger and gave it to Mordecai . Then Esther put Mordecai in charge of everything that belonged to Haman .
ERV	Esther	8	3	Then Esther spoke to the king again . She fell at the king ’ s feet and began crying . She begged the king to cancel the evil plan of Haman the Agagite . Haman had thought up the plan to hurt the Jews .
ERV	Esther	8	4	Then the king held out the gold scepter to Esther . Esther got up and stood in front of the king .
ERV	Esther	8	5	Then she said , “ King , if you like me and if it pleases you , please do this for me . Please do this if you think it is a good idea . If the king is happy with me , please write a command that would stop the command Haman sent out . Haman the Agagite thought of a plan to destroy the Jews in all the king ’ s provinces , and he sent out commands for this to happen .
ERV	Esther	8	6	I am begging the king because I could not bear to see these terrible things happen to my people . I could not bear to see my family killed. ”
ERV	Esther	8	7	King Xerxes answered Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew , “ Because Haman was against the Jews , I have given his property to Esther . And my soldiers have hanged him on the hanging post .
ERV	Esther	8	9	Very quickly the king ’ s secretaries were called . This was done on the 23rd day of the third month , the month of Sivan . They wrote out all of Mordecai ’ s commands to the Jews , and to the satraps , the governors , and officials of the
ERV	Esther	8	127	provinces . These provinces reached from India to Ethiopia . The commands were written in the language of each province and translated into the language of each group of people . The commands were written to the Jews in their own language and alphabet .
ERV	Esther	8	10	Mordecai wrote commands by the authority of King Xerxes . Then he sealed the letters with the king ’ s ring and sent them by messengers on horses . The messengers rode fast horses , which were raised especially for the king .
ERV	Esther	8	11	The king ’ s commands in the letters said this : The Jews in every city have the right to gather together to protect themselves . They have the right to ruin , kill , and completely destroy any army from any group who might attack them and their women and children . And the Jews have the right to take and destroy the property of their enemies .
ERV	Esther	8	12	The day set for the Jews to do this was the 13th day of the twelfth month , the month of Adar . They were permitted to do this in all King Xerxes ’ provinces .
ERV	Esther	8	13	A copy of the letter with the king ’ s command was to be sent out . It became a law in every province . They announced it to all the people of every nation living in the kingdom . They did this so that the Jews would be ready for that special day . They would be allowed to pay their enemies back .
ERV	Esther	8	14	The messengers hurried out , riding on the king ’ s horses . The king commanded them to hurry . And the command was also put in the capital city of Susa .
ERV	Esther	8	15	Mordecai left the king . He was wearing special clothes from the king . His clothes were blue and white , and he had on a large gold crown . He also had a purple robe made of the best linen . There was a special celebration in Susa . The people were very happy .
ERV	Esther	8	16	It was an especially happy day for the Jews , a day of great joy and happiness .
ERV	Esther	8	17	Wherever the king ’ s command went in every province and every city , there was joy and gladness among the Jews . They were having parties and celebrating . Many of the common people from other groups became Jews . They did this because they were very afraid of the Jews .
ERV	Esther	9	9	Parmashta , Arisai , Aridai , and Vaizatha .
ERV	Esther	9	2	The Jews met together in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes so that they would be strong enough to attack the people who wanted to destroy them . No one was strong enough to stand against them . They were afraid of the Jews .
ERV	Esther	9	3	And all the officials of the provinces , the satraps , the governors , and the king ’ s administrators helped the Jews . All the leaders helped them because they were afraid of Mordecai .
ERV	Esther	9	4	Mordecai had become a very important man in the king ’ s palace . Everyone in the provinces knew his name and knew how important he was . And Mordecai became more and more powerful .
ERV	Esther	9	5	The Jews defeated all their enemies . They used swords to kill and destroy them . They did what they wanted to the people who hated them .
ERV	Esther	9	6	They killed and destroyed
ERV	Esther	9	500	men in Susa , including Haman ’ s ten sons . Now , what do you want done in the other provinces of the king ? Tell me , and I will have it done . Ask , and I will do it. ”
ERV	Esther	9	7	They also killed these men : Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
ERV	Esther	9	8	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
ERV	Esther	9	10	These men were the ten sons of Haman . Haman son of Hammedatha was the enemy of the Jews . The Jews killed all the men , but they didn ’ t take anything that belonged to them .
ERV	Esther	9	11	That day the king heard how many men had been killed in the capital city of Susa .
ERV	Esther	9	12	So the king said to Queen Esther , “ The Jews have killed
ERV	Esther	9	13	Esther said , “ If it pleases the king , please let the Jews in Susa do the same thing again tomorrow . Also , hang the bodies of Haman ’ s ten sons on posts. ”
ERV	Esther	9	14	So the king gave the command that it should be done . So the law was given in Susa , and they hanged Haman ’ s ten sons .
ERV	Esther	9	15	The Jews in Susa met together on the 14th day of the month of Adar . They killed
ERV	Esther	9	300	men in Susa , but they didn ’ t take the things that belonged to them .
ERV	Esther	9	16	At the same time , the Jews living in the other provinces also met together . They met together so that they would be strong enough to protect themselves . And so they got rid of their enemies . They killed 75,000 of their enemies . But the Jews didn ’ t take anything that belonged to them .
ERV	Esther	9	17	This happened on the 13th day of the month Adar . On the 14th day the Jews rested and made that day a happy day of feasting . The Festival of Purim
ERV	Esther	9	18	The Jews in Susa had met together on the 13th and 14th days of the month of Adar . And then on the 15th day they rested . So they made the 15th day a happy day of feasting .
ERV	Esther	9	19	So those who live in the country and small villages celebrate Purim on the 14th day of Adar . They keep the 14th day as a happy day of feasting . On this day they have parties and give presents to each other .
ERV	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote everything down that had happened , and then he sent letters to all the Jews in all of King Xerxes ’ provinces . He sent letters far and near .
ERV	Esther	9	21	He did this to tell the Jews to celebrate Purim every year on the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar .
ERV	Esther	9	22	They were to celebrate those days because on those days the Jews got rid of their enemies . And they were also to celebrate that month as the month when their sadness was turned into joy . It was a month when their crying was changed into a day of celebration . Mordecai wrote letters to all the Jews and told them to celebrate those days as a happy day of feasting . They should have parties , give gifts to each other , and give presents to the poor .
ERV	Esther	9	23	So the Jews agreed to do what Mordecai had written to them . And they agreed to continue the celebration they had begun .
ERV	Esther	9	24	Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite was the enemy of all the Jews . He had made an evil plan against the Jews to destroy them . And Haman had thrown the lot to choose a day to ruin and to destroy the Jews . At that time the lot was called a “ pur. ”
ERV	Esther	9	25	Haman did this , but Esther went to talk to the king . So he sent out new commands . These commands not only ruined Haman ’ s plans , but these commands caused those bad things to happen to Haman and his family ! So Haman and his sons were hanged on the posts . 26-27 At this time lots were called “ purim. ” So this festival is called “ Purim. ” Mordecai wrote a letter and told the Jews to celebrate this festival . And so the Jews started the custom of celebrating these two days every year .
ERV	Esther	9	28	They do this to help them remember what they had seen happen to them . The Jews and all the people who join them celebrate these two days every year at the right time in just the right way . Every generation and every family remembers these two days . They celebrate this festival in each and every province and in each and every town . And the Jews will never stop celebrating the days of Purim . Their descendants will always remember this festival .
ERV	Esther	9	29	So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail , along with Mordecai the Jew , wrote an official letter about Purim . They wrote with full authority of the king to prove that the second letter was true .
ERV	Esther	9	30	So Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the
ERV	Esther	9	127	provinces of King Xerxes ’ kingdom . He told the people that the festival should bring peace and make people trust [ a ] each other .
ERV	Esther	9	31	He wrote these letters to tell the people to start celebrating Purim . And he told them when to celebrate this new festival . Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had sent out the command for the Jews to establish this two-day festival for themselves and their descendants . They will remember this festival just as they remember the other festivals when they fast and cry about the bad things that had happened .
ERV	Esther	9	32	Esther ’ s letter made the rules for Purim official , and these things were written down in a book . Footnotes - Esther 9:30 peace … trust Or “ fellowship and truth. ” Zech . 8:19 teaches that this is how people should celebrate the festivals and why God gave them .

ERV	Job	1	5	The day after each of these parties , Job got up early in the morning , sent for his children , and offered a burnt offering for each of them . He thought , “ Maybe my children were careless and sinned against God at their party. ” Job always did this so that his children would be forgiven of their sins .
ERV	Job	1	6	Then the day came for the angels [ a ] to meet with the Lord . Even Satan was there with them .
ERV	Job	1	7	The Lord said to Satan , “ Where have you been ? ” Satan answered the Lord , “ I have been roaming around the earth , going from place to place. ”
ERV	Job	1	8	Then the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you noticed my servant Job ? There is no one on earth like him . He is a good , faithful man . He respects God and refuses to do evil. ”
ERV	Job	1	9	Satan answered the Lord , “ But Job has a good reason to respect you .
ERV	Job	1	10	You always protect him , his family , and everything he has . You have blessed him and made him successful in everything he does . He is so wealthy that his herds and flocks are all over the country .
ERV	Job	1	11	But if you were to destroy everything he has , I promise you that he would curse you to your face. ”
ERV	Job	1	12	The Lord said to Satan , “ All right , do whatever you want with anything that he has , but don ’ t hurt Job himself. ” Then Satan left the meeting . Job Loses Everything
ERV	Job	1	13	One day Job ’ s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother ’ s house .
ERV	Job	1	14	A messenger came to Job and said , “ We were plowing the fields with the oxen and the donkeys were eating grass nearby ,
ERV	Job	1	15	when some Sabeans [ b ] attacked us and took your animals ! They killed the other servants . I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news ! ”
ERV	Job	1	16	That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said , “ A bolt of lightning [ c ] struck your sheep and servants and burned them up . I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news ! ”
ERV	Job	1	17	That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said , “ The Chaldeans [ d ] sent out three raiding parties that attacked us and took the camels ! They killed the other servants . I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news ! ”
ERV	Job	1	18	That messenger was still speaking when another one came in and said , “ Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at the oldest brother ’ s house .
ERV	Job	1	19	A strong wind suddenly came in from across the desert and blew the house down . It fell on your sons and daughters , and they are all dead . I am the only one who escaped to come and tell you the news ! ”
ERV	Job	1	20	When Job heard this , he got up , tore his clothes , and shaved his head to show his sadness . Then he fell to the ground to bow down before God
ERV	Job	1	21	and said , “ When I was born into this world , I was naked and had nothing . When I die and leave this world , I will be naked and have nothing . The Lord gives , and the Lord takes away . Praise the name of the Lord ! ”
ERV	Job	1	22	Even after all this , Job did not sin . He did not accuse God of doing anything wrong . Footnotes - Job 1:6 angels Literally , “ sons of God. ” - Job 1:15 Sabeans A group of people from the Arabian Desert , probably south of Uz . - Job 1:16 A bolt of lightning Or “ God ’ s fire fell from the sky. ” - Job 1:17 Chaldeans Tribes of people who moved from place to place in the area between the Euphrates and Jordan rivers .
ERV	Job	2	2	The Lord said to Satan , “ Where have you been ? ” Satan answered the Lord , “ I have been roaming around the earth , going from place to place. ”
ERV	Job	2	3	Then the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you noticed my servant Job ? There is no one on earth like him . He is a good , faithful man . He respects God and refuses to do evil . He is still faithful , even though you asked me to let you destroy , without reason , everything he has. ”
ERV	Job	2	4	Satan answered , “ Skin for skin ! [ b ] A man will give everything he has to protect himself .
ERV	Job	2	5	I swear , if you attack his flesh and bones , he will curse you to your face ! ”
ERV	Job	2	6	So the Lord said to Satan , “ All right , Job is in your hands , but you are not allowed to kill him. ”
ERV	Job	2	7	So Satan left the meeting with the Lord and gave Job painful sores all over his body , from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head .
ERV	Job	2	8	Job sat on the pile of ashes where he was mourning and used a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores .
ERV	Job	2	9	His wife said to him , “ Are you still holding on to your faith ? Why don ’ t you just curse God and die ! ”
ERV	Job	2	10	Job answered , “ You sound like one of those fools on the street corner ! How can we accept all the good things that God gives us and not accept the problems ? ” So even after all that happened to Job , he did not sin . He did not accuse God of doing anything wrong . Job ’ s Three Friends Come to See Him
ERV	Job	2	11	Job ’ s three friends heard about all the bad things that happened to him , so Eliphaz came from Teman , Bildad from Shuah , and Zophar from Naamah . They met together and went to comfort Job and show him their sympathy .
ERV	Job	2	12	But his friends didn ’ t even recognize him when they first saw him in the distance ! They began to cry loudly . They tore their clothes and threw dirt in the air over their heads to show how sad they were .
ERV	Job	2	13	Then they sat on the ground with Job for seven days and seven nights . They didn ’ t say a word , because they saw he was in so much pain .
ERV	Job	3	3	“ I wish the day I was born would be lost forever . I wish the night they said , ‘ It ’ s a boy ! ’ had never happened .
ERV	Job	3	2	He said ,
ERV	Job	3	4	I wish that day had remained dark . I wish God above had forgotten that day and not let any light shine on it .
ERV	Job	3	5	I wish that bitter day had remained as dark as death , covered with the darkest clouds .
ERV	Job	3	6	I wish the darkness had carried away that night , that it was left off the calendar and not included in any of the months .
ERV	Job	3	7	I wish that night had produced nothing and no happy shouts had been heard .
ERV	Job	3	8	Some magicians think they can wake Leviathan . [ a ] So let them say their curses and curse the day I was born .
ERV	Job	3	9	Let that day ’ s morning star be dark . Let that night wait for a morning that never comes . I wish it had never seen the first rays of sunlight .
ERV	Job	3	10	I wish it had stopped me from being born and kept me from seeing all these troubles .
ERV	Job	3	11	Why didn ’ t I die when I was born ? Why didn ’ t I die as I came from my mother ’ s womb ?
ERV	Job	3	12	Why did my mother hold me on her knees ? Why did her breasts feed me ?
ERV	Job	3	13	If I had died when I was born , I would be at peace now . I wish I were asleep and at rest
ERV	Job	3	14	with the kings and their advisors who built palaces that are now in ruins .
ERV	Job	3	15	I wish I were buried with rulers who filled their graves with gold and silver .
ERV	Job	3	16	Why wasn ’ t I a child who died at birth and was put in the ground ? I wish I had been buried like a baby who never saw the light of day .
ERV	Job	3	17	There the wicked stop causing trouble , and the weary find rest .
ERV	Job	3	18	Even prisoners find relief there ; they no longer hear their guards shouting at them .
ERV	Job	3	19	Everyone—from the greatest to the least important—will be there , and even the slave is free from his master .
ERV	Job	3	20	“ Why must a suffering person continue to live ? Why let anyone live such a bitter life ?
ERV	Job	3	21	Such people want to die , but death does not come . They search for death more than for hidden treasure .
ERV	Job	3	22	They would be happy to find their grave . They would rejoice to find their tomb .
ERV	Job	3	23	But God keeps their future a secret and builds a wall around them to protect them .
ERV	Job	3	24	When it is time to eat , all I can do is sigh with sadness , not joy . My groans pour out like water .
ERV	Job	3	25	I was afraid something terrible would happen , and what I feared most has happened .
ERV	Job	3	26	I can not calm down or relax . I am too upset to rest ! ” Footnotes - Job 3:8 Leviathan Here , this is probably a giant sea monster . Some people thought magicians were able to make it “ swallow the sun , ” that is , cause an eclipse .
ERV	Job	4	4	Your words helped those who were ready to fall . You gave strength to those who could not stand by themselves .
ERV	Job	4	2	“ I must say something . Would it upset you if I speak ?
ERV	Job	4	3	Job , you have taught many people . You encouraged those who were ready to quit .
ERV	Job	4	5	But now trouble comes to you , and you are discouraged . Trouble hits you , and you are upset .
ERV	Job	4	6	You worship God . You trust him . You are a good man , so let that be your hope .
ERV	Job	4	7	Can you think of any innocent person who was ever destroyed ? Do you know of any place where good people are punished ?
ERV	Job	4	8	Yes , I have seen people whose lives were cut short , but they were evil troublemakers .
ERV	Job	4	9	They lost the breath God gave them . They were cut off from his breath of life .
ERV	Job	4	10	They were like roaring lions , like growling lions with broken teeth—
ERV	Job	4	11	like a lioness that can not find prey . They died , and their cubs starved to death .
ERV	Job	4	12	“ I happened to hear a message . My ears caught a whisper of it .
ERV	Job	4	13	Like a bad dream [ a ] in the night , it ruined my sleep .
ERV	Job	4	14	It frightened me , and I trembled down to my bones .
ERV	Job	4	15	A spirit passed by my face . The hair on my body stood up !
ERV	Job	4	16	The spirit stood still , but I could not see what it was . A shape stood before my eyes , and there was silence . Then I heard a quiet voice :
ERV	Job	4	17	‘ A person can not be more right than God . People can not be more pure than their Maker .
ERV	Job	4	18	Look , God can not even trust his heavenly servants . He sees faults even in his angels .
ERV	Job	4	19	So surely people are worse ! They live in houses of clay [ b ] built on dust . They can be crushed as easily as a moth !
ERV	Job	4	20	From dawn to sunset people are destroyed . They die—gone forever—and no one even notices .
ERV	Job	4	21	The ropes of their tent are pulled up , and they die before gaining wisdom . ’
ERV	Job	5	5	Hungry people ate all his crops , even the grain growing among the thorns , and greedy people took all he had .
ERV	Job	5	2	A fool ’ s anger will kill him . His jealousy will destroy him .
ERV	Job	5	3	I saw a fool who thought he was safe , but suddenly he died . [ a ]
ERV	Job	5	4	There was no one to help his children . No one defended them in court .
ERV	Job	5	6	Bad times don ’ t come up from the dirt . Trouble does not grow from the ground .
ERV	Job	5	7	But people are born to have trouble , as surely as sparks rise from a fire .
ERV	Job	5	8	If I were you , I would turn to God and tell him about my problems .
ERV	Job	5	9	People can not understand the wonderful things God does . His miracles are too many to count .
ERV	Job	5	10	He sends rain all over the earth and waters the fields .
ERV	Job	5	11	He raises up the humble and makes sad people happy .
ERV	Job	5	12	He spoils the plans of even the smartest people so that they will not succeed .
ERV	Job	5	13	He catches those who think they are wise in their own clever traps and brings to an end their evil plans .
ERV	Job	5	14	Daylight will be like darkness for them . Even at noon they will have to feel their way as in the dark .
ERV	Job	5	15	God saves the poor from the hurtful words of the wicked . He saves them from those who are powerful .
ERV	Job	5	16	So the poor have hope ; God shuts the mouths of those who would cause them harm .
ERV	Job	5	17	“ You are fortunate when God corrects you . So don ’ t complain when God All-Powerful punishes you .
ERV	Job	5	18	God might injure you , but he will bandage those wounds . He might hurt you , but his hands also heal .
ERV	Job	5	19	He will save you again and again . No evil will harm you . [ b ]
ERV	Job	5	20	God will save you from death when there is famine . He will protect you from the sword when there is war .
ERV	Job	5	21	People might say bad things about you with their sharp tongues . But God will protect you . You will not be afraid when bad things happen !
ERV	Job	5	22	You will laugh at destruction and famine . You will not be afraid of wild animals !
ERV	Job	5	23	It is as if you have a peace treaty with the wild animals and the rocks in the field .
ERV	Job	5	24	You will live in peace because your tent is safe . You will count your property and find nothing missing .
ERV	Job	5	25	You will have many children . They will be as many as the blades of grass on the earth .
ERV	Job	5	26	You will be like the wheat that grows until harvest time . Yes , you will live to a ripe old age .
ERV	Job	5	27	“ We have studied this and know it is true . So listen to us , and learn for yourself . ”
ERV	Job	6	6	Food without salt does not taste good , and the white of an egg has no taste .
ERV	Job	6	2	“ I wish my suffering could be weighed and all my trouble be put on the scales .
ERV	Job	6	3	They would be heavier than all the sand of the sea ! That is why my words are so crazy .
ERV	Job	6	4	God All-Powerful has shot me with his arrows . My spirit feels their poison ! God ’ s terrible weapons are lined up against me .
ERV	Job	6	5	Even a wild donkey does not complain when it has grass to eat . And a cow is quiet when it has food .
ERV	Job	6	7	I refuse to touch that kind of food ; it makes me sick !
ERV	Job	6	8	“ I wish I could have what I ask for . I wish God would give me what I want .
ERV	Job	6	9	I wish he would crush me— just go ahead and kill me !
ERV	Job	6	10	Then I would be comforted by this one thing : Even through all this pain , I never refused to obey the commands of the Holy One .
ERV	Job	6	11	“ With my strength gone , I have no hope to go on living . With nothing to look forward to , why should I be patient ?
ERV	Job	6	12	I am not strong like a rock . My body is not made from bronze .
ERV	Job	6	13	I don ’ t have the power to help myself , because all hope of success has been taken away from me .
ERV	Job	6	14	“ Friends should be loyal to you in times of trouble , even if you turn away from God All-Powerful . [ a ]
ERV	Job	6	15	But I can not depend on you , my brothers . You are like a stream that has no water when the weather is dry but is flooded when the rains come .
ERV	Job	6	16	In the winter , it is choked with ice and melting snow .
ERV	Job	6	17	But when the weather is hot and dry , the water stops flowing , and the stream disappears .
ERV	Job	6	18	It twists and turns along the way and then disappears into the desert .
ERV	Job	6	19	Traders from Tema search for it . Travelers from Sheba hope to find it .
ERV	Job	6	20	They are sure they can find water , but they will be disappointed .
ERV	Job	6	21	Now , you are like those streams . You see my troubles and are afraid .
ERV	Job	6	22	But have I ever asked you to help me ? Did I ask you to offer a bribe for me from your wealth ?
ERV	Job	6	23	No , and I never said , ‘ Save me from my enemies ! ’ or ‘ Save me from those who are cruel ! ’
ERV	Job	6	24	“ So now , teach me , and I will be quiet . Show me what I have done wrong .
ERV	Job	6	25	Honest words are powerful , but your arguments prove nothing .
ERV	Job	6	26	Do you plan to criticize me ? Will you speak more tiring words ?
ERV	Job	6	27	Are you the kind of people who would gamble for orphans and sell out your own friends ?
ERV	Job	6	28	Now , look me in the face , and see that I am telling the truth !
ERV	Job	6	29	You need to start over and stop being so unfair ! Think again , because I am innocent .
ERV	Job	6	30	I am not lying . I know right from wrong . Footnotes - Job 6:14 Or “ People who fail to be loyal to their friends have also failed to respect God All-Powerful . ”
ERV	Job	7	7	God , remember , my life is like a breath . I will not get a second chance to enjoy it .
ERV	Job	7	2	They are like a slave looking for cool shade or a hired worker waiting for payday .
ERV	Job	7	3	Month after frustrating month has gone by . I have suffered night after night .
ERV	Job	7	4	When I lie down , I think , ‘ How long before it ’ s time to get up ? ’ The night drags on . I toss and turn until the sun comes up .
ERV	Job	7	5	My skin is covered with worms and scabs . It is cracked and covered with sores .
ERV	Job	7	6	“ My days pass by faster than a weaver ’ s shuttle , [ a ] and my life will end without hope .
ERV	Job	7	8	Those who see me now will never see me again . You watch me for a while , but then I am gone .
ERV	Job	7	9	Just as clouds that come and go , people are put in the grave , never to rise again .
ERV	Job	7	10	They don ’ t come back to their old homes . The people there would not know them .
ERV	Job	7	11	“ So I will not be quiet ! I will let my suffering spirit speak ! I will let my bitter soul complain !
ERV	Job	7	12	Am I one of your enemies ? Is that why you put a guard over me ? [ b ]
ERV	Job	7	13	My bed should bring me comfort . My couch should give me rest and relief .
ERV	Job	7	14	But when I lie down , you scare me with dreams ; you frighten me with visions .
ERV	Job	7	15	So I would rather be choked to death than to live like this .
ERV	Job	7	16	I hate my life—I give up . I don ’ t want to live forever . Leave me alone ! My life means nothing .
ERV	Job	7	17	God , why are people so important to you ? Why do you even notice them ?
ERV	Job	7	18	Why do you visit them every morning and test them at every moment ?
ERV	Job	7	19	You never look away from me or leave me alone for a second .
ERV	Job	7	20	You are always watching us ! If I sinned , would that hurt you ? Why have you made me your target ? Have I become a problem for you ?
ERV	Job	7	21	Why don ’ t you just pardon me for doing wrong ? Why don ’ t you just forgive me for my sins ? Soon I will die and be in my grave . You will search for me , but I will be gone . ”
ERV	Job	8	8	“ Ask those who are now old . Find out what their ancestors learned .
ERV	Job	8	2	“ How long will you talk like that ? Your words are nothing but hot air !
ERV	Job	8	3	God is always fair . God All-Powerful does what is right .
ERV	Job	8	4	If your children sinned against God , he punished them . They paid for their sins .
ERV	Job	8	5	But now , look to God and pray to the All-Powerful .
ERV	Job	8	6	If you are pure and good , he will quickly come to help you . He will give your family back to you .
ERV	Job	8	7	Then you will have a lot more than you had in the beginning !
ERV	Job	8	9	It seems as though we were born yesterday . We are too young to know anything . Our days on earth are very short , like a shadow .
ERV	Job	8	10	Maybe the old people can tell you something . Maybe they will teach you what they learned .
ERV	Job	8	11	“ Can papyrus grow tall on a dry land ? Can reeds grow without water ?
ERV	Job	8	12	No , they will dry up before harvest . They will be too small to cut and use .
ERV	Job	8	13	People who forget God are like that . Those who oppose him have no hope .
ERV	Job	8	14	They have put their trust in something weak . It is like a spider ’ s web .
ERV	Job	8	15	When they lean against it , it will break . When they reach out for it , it will not hold them up .
ERV	Job	8	16	Such people are like a vine that gets plenty of water and sunshine , and its branches spread throughout the garden .
ERV	Job	8	17	Its roots spread among the rocks , searching for good soil .
ERV	Job	8	18	But if you move it , it will die , and no one can tell it was ever there .
ERV	Job	8	19	Everything might have been going well , but another vine will take its place .
ERV	Job	8	20	God does not support evil people , and he does not abandon the innocent .
ERV	Job	8	21	So perhaps you might laugh again . Maybe shouts of joy will come from your lips .
ERV	Job	8	22	Maybe your enemies will be humiliated and the homes of the wicked destroyed . ”
ERV	Job	9	9	“ God made the Bear , Orion , and the Pleiades . [ a ] He made the planets that cross the southern sky . [ b ]
ERV	Job	9	2	“ Of course , I know that this is true . But how can a human being win an argument with God ?
ERV	Job	9	3	Anyone who chose to argue with him could not answer one question in a thousand !
ERV	Job	9	4	God is so wise and powerful that no one could oppose him and survive .
ERV	Job	9	5	When God is angry , he moves mountains before they know what happened .
ERV	Job	9	6	He can shake the earth , and it will tremble down to its foundations .
ERV	Job	9	7	With one command he can stop the sun from rising . He can lock up the stars and keep them from shining .
ERV	Job	9	8	He alone made the skies , and he walks on the ocean waves .
ERV	Job	9	10	He does things too marvelous for people to understand . He does too many miracles to count !
ERV	Job	9	11	When he passes by , I can not see him . He goes right past me , and I don ’ t notice .
ERV	Job	9	12	If he takes something away , no one can stop him . No one can say to him , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
ERV	Job	9	13	God will not hold back his anger . Even Rahab ’ s helpers are afraid of him .
ERV	Job	9	14	So I can not argue with God . I would not know what to say to him .
ERV	Job	9	15	I am innocent , but I can not give him an answer . All I can do is beg my Judge for mercy .
ERV	Job	9	16	Even if I called and he answered , I can not believe he would listen to me .
ERV	Job	9	17	He would just send storms to crush me . He would give me more wounds for no reason .
ERV	Job	9	18	He would not let me catch my breath again . He would just give me more trouble .
ERV	Job	9	19	I can not defeat God . He is too powerful ! I can not take him to court for justice . Who could force him to come ?
ERV	Job	9	20	I am innocent , but anything I say makes me seem guilty . I am innocent , but if I speak , my mouth proves me wrong .
ERV	Job	9	21	I am innocent , but I don ’ t know what to think . I hate my own life .
ERV	Job	9	22	So I say , ‘ Does it make any difference ? God destroys the innocent as well as the guilty. ’
ERV	Job	9	23	Is it God who laughs when a disaster kills innocent people ?
ERV	Job	9	24	Is it God who keeps the leaders from seeing when an evil person takes control ? If it is not God , then who is it ?
ERV	Job	9	25	“ My days are passing faster than a runner . They are flying by without any joy .
ERV	Job	9	26	They go by as quickly as papyrus boats , as fast as an eagle swooping down on its prey .
ERV	Job	9	27	“ I could say , ‘ I will not complain . I will forget my pain and put a smile on my face. ’
ERV	Job	9	28	But the suffering still frightens me . I know that God will not see me as innocent .
ERV	Job	9	29	I will be found guilty , so why should I even think about it ?
ERV	Job	9	30	Even if I scrubbed my hands with soap and washed myself whiter than snow ,
ERV	Job	9	31	God would still push me into the slime pit , [ c ] and even my clothes would hate to touch me .
ERV	Job	9	32	God is not a human like me , so I can not argue with him . I can not take him to court .
ERV	Job	9	33	I wish there were someone who could listen to both sides , [ d ] someone to judge both of us in a fair way .
ERV	Job	9	34	I wish someone could take away the threat of God ’ s punishment . Then he would not frighten me anymore .
ERV	Job	9	35	Then I could say what I want without being afraid of him . But I can not do that now .

ERV	Job	10	10	You poured me out like milk . You spun me around and squeezed me like someone making cheese .
ERV	Job	10	2	I will say to God , ‘ Don ’ t just say I am guilty ! Tell me what you have against me .
ERV	Job	10	3	Do you enjoy hurting me ? Do you enjoy ignoring me while smiling at what evil people say ?
ERV	Job	10	4	Do you have human eyes ? Do you see things the way people do ?
ERV	Job	10	5	Is your life as short as ours ? Is your life as short as a man ’ s life ?
ERV	Job	10	6	You look for my wrong and search for my sin .
ERV	Job	10	7	You know I am innocent , but no one can save me from your power !
ERV	Job	10	8	Your hands made me and shaped my body . But now they are closing around me and squeezing me to death !
ERV	Job	10	9	Remember , you molded me like clay . Will you turn me into clay again ?
ERV	Job	10	11	You put me together with bones and muscles , and then you clothed me with skin and flesh .
ERV	Job	10	12	You gave me life and were very kind to me . You cared for me and watched over my spirit .
ERV	Job	10	13	But this is what you hid in your heart . Now I know what you were planning for me .
ERV	Job	10	14	If I sinned , you would be watching me so that you could punish me for doing wrong .
ERV	Job	10	15	If I sin , I am guilty and should be cursed . But even when I am innocent , I can not lift up my head . I am so ashamed because of all the troubles I have .
ERV	Job	10	16	If I have any success and feel proud , you hunt me down like a lion and show your power over me .
ERV	Job	10	17	You bring witness after witness to prove that I am wrong . Again and again you show your anger as you send army after army against me .
ERV	Job	10	18	So why did you let me be born ? I wish I had died before anyone saw me .
ERV	Job	10	19	I wish I had never lived . I wish they had carried me from my mother ’ s womb straight to the grave .
ERV	Job	10	20	My life is almost finished . So leave me alone ! Let me enjoy the little time I have left .
ERV	Job	10	21	I am going soon to the land of no return , the place of death and darkness—
ERV	Job	10	22	that land of darkest night , of shadows and confusion , where even the light is darkness . ’ ”
ERV	Job	11	11	God knows who is worthless . When he sees evil , he remembers it .
ERV	Job	11	2	“ This flood of words should be answered ! Does all this talking make Job right ?
ERV	Job	11	3	Do you think we don ’ t have an answer for you ? Do you think no one will warn you when you laugh at God ?
ERV	Job	11	4	You say to God , ‘ My arguments are right , and you can see I am pure. ’
ERV	Job	11	5	I wish God would answer you and tell you that you are wrong .
ERV	Job	11	6	He could tell you the secret of wisdom . He would tell you that every story has two sides . You can be sure of this : God is not punishing you as much as he should .
ERV	Job	11	7	“ Do you think you really understand God ? Do you completely understand God All-Powerful ?
ERV	Job	11	8	That knowledge is higher than the heavens and deeper than the place of death . So what can you do ? How can you learn it all ?
ERV	Job	11	9	It is greater than the earth and bigger than the seas .
ERV	Job	11	10	“ If God decides to arrest you and take you to court , no one could stop him .
ERV	Job	11	12	A wild donkey can not give birth to a man , and a stupid person will never become wise .
ERV	Job	11	13	Prepare your heart to serve only God . Lift your arms and pray to him .
ERV	Job	11	14	Put away the sin that you still hold on to . Don ’ t keep evil in your tent .
ERV	Job	11	15	If you will do that , you could look to God without shame . You can stand strong and not be afraid .
ERV	Job	11	16	Then you can forget your troubles , like water that has already passed by .
ERV	Job	11	17	Your life will be brighter than the sunshine at noon . Life ’ s darkest hours will shine like the morning sun .
ERV	Job	11	18	You will feel safe because there is hope . God will protect you and give you rest .
ERV	Job	11	19	You will lie down without fear of anyone . Many people will come to you for help .
ERV	Job	11	20	Evil people might look for help , but they will not escape their troubles . Their hope leads only to death . ”
ERV	Job	12	12	People say , ‘ Wisdom is to be found in those who are old . Long life brings understanding. ’
ERV	Job	12	2	“ I ’ m sure you think you are the only wise people left . You think that when you die , wisdom will be gone with you .
ERV	Job	12	3	But my mind is as good as yours . You aren ’ t any smarter than I am . You haven ’ t said anything that people don ’ t already know .
ERV	Job	12	4	“ My friends laugh at me now . They say , ‘ He prayed to God and got his answer. ’ I am a good , innocent man , but still they laugh at me .
ERV	Job	12	5	Those who have no troubles make fun of those who do . They hit a man when he is down .
ERV	Job	12	6	But robbers ’ tents are not bothered . Those who make God angry live in peace , even though God has them in his power .
ERV	Job	12	7	“ But ask the animals , and they will teach you . Or ask the birds of the air , and they will tell you .
ERV	Job	12	8	Or speak to the earth , and it will teach you . Or let the fish in the sea tell you their wisdom .
ERV	Job	12	9	Everyone knows that the Lord made these things .
ERV	Job	12	10	Every animal that lives and everyone who breathes— they are all under God ’ s power .
ERV	Job	12	11	But just as the tongue tastes food , the ears test the words they hear .
ERV	Job	12	13	But wisdom and power belong to God . Good advice and understanding are his .
ERV	Job	12	14	Anything God tears down can not be rebuilt . Anyone he puts in prison can not be set free .
ERV	Job	12	15	If he holds back the rain , the earth will dry up . If he lets the rain loose , it will flood the land .
ERV	Job	12	16	God is strong and always wins . He controls those who fool others and those who are fooled .
ERV	Job	12	17	He strips advisors of their wisdom and makes leaders act like fools .
ERV	Job	12	18	He strips kings of their authority and makes them slaves .
ERV	Job	12	19	He strips priests of their power and removes those who feel so secure in their position .
ERV	Job	12	20	He makes trusted advisors be silent . He takes away the wisdom of the older leaders .
ERV	Job	12	21	He brings disgrace to important people . He takes power away from rulers .
ERV	Job	12	22	He exposes even the darkest secrets . He sends light into places that are as dark as death .
ERV	Job	12	23	God makes nations great , and then he destroys them . He makes nations grow large , and then he scatters their people .
ERV	Job	12	24	He makes their leaders foolish . He makes them wander around in the desert .
ERV	Job	12	25	They are like someone feeling their way in the dark . They are like drunks who don ’ t know where they are going .
ERV	Job	13	13	“ Be quiet and let me talk ! I accept whatever happens to me .
ERV	Job	13	2	I know as much as you do . I am as smart as you are .
ERV	Job	13	3	But I don ’ t want to argue with you . I want to speak to God All-Powerful . I want to argue with God about my troubles .
ERV	Job	13	4	But you men try to cover up your ignorance with lies . You are like worthless doctors who can not heal anyone .
ERV	Job	13	5	I wish you would just be quiet . That would be the wisest thing you could do .
ERV	Job	13	6	“ Now , listen to my argument . Listen to what I have to say .
ERV	Job	13	7	Will you speak lies for God ? Do you really believe your lies are what God wants you to say ?
ERV	Job	13	8	Are you trying to defend God against me ? You are not being fair . You are choosing God ’ s side simply because he is God .
ERV	Job	13	9	If God checked you very closely , would he see that you are right ? Do you really think you can fool God the same as you fool people ?
ERV	Job	13	10	You know that God would criticize you if you chose someone ’ s side simply because they were important .
ERV	Job	13	11	God ’ s majesty frightens you . You are afraid of him .
ERV	Job	13	12	The wise sayings you quote are worthless . Your arguments are as weak as clay .
ERV	Job	13	14	I will put myself in danger and take my life in my own hands .
ERV	Job	13	15	I will continue to trust God even if he kills me . [ a ] But I will defend myself to his face .
ERV	Job	13	16	And if he lets me live , it will be because I had the confidence to speak . No guilty person would dare meet God face to face .
ERV	Job	13	17	Listen carefully to what I say . Let me explain .
ERV	Job	13	18	I am ready now to defend myself . I will carefully present my arguments . I know I will be shown to be right .
ERV	Job	13	19	If anyone can prove I am wrong , I will shut up and wait to die .
ERV	Job	13	20	“ God , just give me two things , and then I will not hide from you :
ERV	Job	13	21	Stop punishing me , and don ’ t frighten me with your terrors .
ERV	Job	13	22	Then call to me , and I will answer you . Or let me speak , and you answer me .
ERV	Job	13	23	How many sins have I committed ? What wrongs have I done ? Show me where I went wrong or how I sinned .
ERV	Job	13	24	God , why do you avoid me and treat me like your enemy ?
ERV	Job	13	25	Are you trying to scare me ? I am only a leaf blowing in the wind . You are attacking a piece of straw !
ERV	Job	13	26	You have a list of terrible charges against me . Are you making me suffer for the sins I did when I was young ?
ERV	Job	13	27	You have put chains on my feet . You watch every step I take . You see every move I make .
ERV	Job	13	28	So I am becoming weaker and weaker , like a piece of wood rotting away , like a piece of cloth eaten by moths . Footnotes - Job 13:15 I will … kills me Or “ If he decides to kill me , I have no hope . ”
ERV	Job	14	14	If a man dies , will he live again ? If so , I would gladly suffer through this time waiting for my release . [ b ]
ERV	Job	14	2	Our life is like a flower that grows quickly and then dies away . Our life is like a shadow that is here for a short time and then is gone .
ERV	Job	14	3	God , do you need to keep an eye on something so small ? Why bother to bring charges against me ?
ERV	Job	14	4	“ No one can make something clean from something so dirty .
ERV	Job	14	5	The length of our life has been decided . You alone know how long that is . You have set the limits for us and nothing can change them .
ERV	Job	14	6	So stop watching us ; leave us alone , and let us enjoy this hard life until we have put in our time .
ERV	Job	14	7	“ There is always hope for a tree . If it is cut down , it can grow again . It will keep sending out new branches .
ERV	Job	14	8	Its roots might grow old in the ground and its stump die in the dirt ,
ERV	Job	14	9	but with water , it will grow again . It will grow branches like a new plant .
ERV	Job	14	10	But when a man dies , he becomes weak and sick , and then he is gone !
ERV	Job	14	11	Like a lake that goes dry or a river that loses its source ,
ERV	Job	14	12	so people lose their lives , never to live again . The skies will all pass away before they rise from death . The skies will all disappear before anyone wakes up from that sleep !
ERV	Job	14	13	“ I wish you would hide me in my grave . I wish you would hide me there , until your anger is gone . Then you could pick a time to remember me .
ERV	Job	14	15	God , you would call me , and I would answer you . Then I , the one you made , would be important to you .
ERV	Job	14	16	You would still watch every step I take , but you would not remember my sins .
ERV	Job	14	17	It would be as if you had sealed my sins in a bag . It would be as if you had covered my guilt with plaster .
ERV	Job	14	18	“ Mountains fall and crumble away . Large rocks break loose and fall .
ERV	Job	14	19	Water flowing over stones wears them down . Floods wash away the soil on the ground . In the same way , God , you destroy the hope people have .
ERV	Job	14	20	You defeat them completely and then they are gone . You change the way they look and send them away forever to the place of death .
ERV	Job	14	21	If their sons are honored , they will never know it . If their sons do wrong , they will never see it .
ERV	Job	14	22	They only feel the pain in their bodies , and they alone cry for themselves . ”
ERV	Job	15	15	God does not even trust his angels . [ b ] He does not even think the sky is pure .
ERV	Job	15	2	“ If you were really wise , you would not answer with your worthless personal opinions ! A wise man would not be so full of hot air .
ERV	Job	15	3	Do you think a wise man would use empty words and meaningless speeches to win his arguments ?
ERV	Job	15	4	If you had your way , no one would respect God and pray to him .
ERV	Job	15	5	What you say clearly shows your sin . Job , you are trying to hide your sin by using clever words .
ERV	Job	15	6	I don ’ t need to prove to you that you are wrong . The words from your own mouth show that you are wrong . Your own lips speak against you .
ERV	Job	15	7	“ Do you think you were the first person ever to be born ? Were you born before the hills ?
ERV	Job	15	8	Did you listen to God ’ s secret plans ? Do you think you are the only wise person ?
ERV	Job	15	9	We know as much as you do ! We understand as well as you .
ERV	Job	15	10	The old , gray-haired men agree with us . People older than your father are on our side .
ERV	Job	15	11	God tries to comfort you , but that is not enough for you . We have spoken his message to you in a gentle way .
ERV	Job	15	12	Why will you not understand ? Why can you not see the truth ?
ERV	Job	15	13	You are expressing your anger against God when you say these things .
ERV	Job	15	14	“ People can not really be pure . They [ a ] can not be more right than God !
ERV	Job	15	16	People are even worse . They are disgusting and dirty . They drink up evil like water .
ERV	Job	15	17	“ Listen to me , and I will explain it to you . Let me tell you what I have seen .
ERV	Job	15	18	I will tell you what wise men would say , things they heard from their fathers and then freely passed on . They didn ’ t hide any secrets from me .
ERV	Job	15	19	These are important people in our country ! Everyone knows who they are .
ERV	Job	15	20	And they said that an evil man suffers all his life . A cruel man suffers all his numbered years .
ERV	Job	15	21	Every noise scares him . His enemy will attack him when he thinks he is safe .
ERV	Job	15	22	An evil man has no hope of escaping the darkness . There is a sword somewhere waiting to kill him .
ERV	Job	15	23	He wanders from place to place , looking for food . But he knows a dark day is coming , which he brought on himself .
ERV	Job	15	24	He lives in fear , with worry and suffering threatening him like a king ready to attack .
ERV	Job	15	25	That is because that evil man shook his fist at God , refusing to obey . He dared to attack God All-Powerful ,
ERV	Job	15	26	like a soldier with a thick , strong shield who runs at his enemy to strike him in the neck .
ERV	Job	15	27	He might be rich and fat ,
ERV	Job	15	28	but his town will be ruined ; his home will be destroyed ; his house will be empty .
ERV	Job	15	29	He will not be rich for long . His wealth will not last . His crops will not grow large .
ERV	Job	15	30	He will not escape the darkness . He will be like a tree whose leaves die from disease and are blown away by the wind .
ERV	Job	15	31	That evil man should not fool himself by trusting in worthless things , because he will keep nothing .
ERV	Job	15	32	He will die before his time , like a tree whose top branches have already begun to die .
ERV	Job	15	33	He will be like a vine that loses its grapes before they ripen . He will be like an olive tree that loses its buds .
ERV	Job	15	34	That is because people without God have nothing . Those who take bribes will have their homes destroyed by fire .
ERV	Job	15	35	They are always thinking of ways to do evil and cause trouble . They are always planning how they might cheat others . ”
ERV	Job	16	16	My face is red from crying . There are dark rings around my eyes .
ERV	Job	16	2	“ I have heard all these things before . You men give me trouble , not comfort .
ERV	Job	16	3	Your long speeches never end ! Why do you continue arguing ?
ERV	Job	16	4	I also could say the same things you say , if you had my troubles . I could say wise things against you and shake my head at you .
ERV	Job	16	5	But I would say things to encourage you and give you hope .
ERV	Job	16	6	“ Nothing I say makes my pain go away . But keeping quiet does not help either .
ERV	Job	16	7	God , you surely took away my strength . You destroyed my whole family .
ERV	Job	16	8	You have made me thin and weak , and people think that means I am guilty .
ERV	Job	16	9	“ God attacks me ; he is angry with me and tears my body apart . He grinds his teeth against me . My enemy looks at me with hate .
ERV	Job	16	10	People have crowded around me . They make fun of me and slap my face .
ERV	Job	16	11	God has given me to evil people . He let the wicked hurt me .
ERV	Job	16	12	I was enjoying a quiet , peaceful life , but then God crushed me . Yes , he took me by the neck and broke me into pieces . He has made me his target .
ERV	Job	16	13	With his archers all around me , he shoots arrows into my kidneys . He shows no mercy and spills my gall [ a ] on the ground .
ERV	Job	16	14	Again and again he attacks me . He runs at me like a soldier in battle .
ERV	Job	16	15	“ I am very sad , so I wear this sackcloth . I sit here in dust and ashes , feeling defeated .
ERV	Job	16	17	I was never cruel to anyone , and my prayers are pure .
ERV	Job	16	18	“ Earth , don ’ t hide the wrong things that were done to me . [ b ] Don ’ t let my begging for fairness be stopped .
ERV	Job	16	19	Even now there is someone in heaven who will speak for me . There is someone above who will testify for me .
ERV	Job	16	20	My friend speaks for me , while my eyes pour out tears to God .
ERV	Job	16	21	He speaks to God for me , like someone [ c ] presenting an argument for a friend .
ERV	Job	16	22	“ In only a few years I will go to that place of no return .
ERV	Job	17	17	My spirit is broken ; I am ready to give up . My life is almost gone ; the grave is waiting for me .
ERV	Job	17	2	People stand around me and laugh at me . I watch them as they tease and insult me .
ERV	Job	17	3	“ God , give me some support . No one else will !
ERV	Job	17	4	You have closed my friends ’ minds , and they don ’ t understand . Please don ’ t let them win .
ERV	Job	17	5	You know what people say : ‘ A man neglects his own children to help his friends. ’ [ a ] But my friends have turned against me .
ERV	Job	17	6	God has made my name a bad word to everyone . People spit in my face .
ERV	Job	17	7	My eyes are almost blind from my grief . My whole body is as thin as a shadow .
ERV	Job	17	8	Good people wonder how this could happen . The innocent are upset with anyone who is against God .
ERV	Job	17	9	But those who do right will continue to do what is right . Those who are not guilty grow stronger and stronger .
ERV	Job	17	10	“ But come on , all of you , and try to prove me wrong . I don ’ t find any of you to be wise .
ERV	Job	17	11	My life is passing away , and my plans are destroyed . My hope is gone .
ERV	Job	17	12	Everything is confused— night is day , and evening comes when it should be dawn .
ERV	Job	17	13	“ I might hope for the grave to be my new home . I might hope to make my bed in the dark grave .
ERV	Job	17	14	I might say to the grave , ‘ You are my father , ’ and to the worms , ‘ my mother ’ or ‘ my sister. ’
ERV	Job	17	15	But you can ’ t really call that hope , can you ? Does anyone see any hope for me ?
ERV	Job	17	16	Will hope go down with me to the place of death ? Will we go down into the dirt together ? ” Footnotes - Job 17:5 You know … friends Literally , “ He promises a share to his friends and his children ’ s eyes go blind . ”
ERV	Job	18	18	They will be forced from light into darkness . They will be chased out of this world .
ERV	Job	18	2	“ When will you stop talking ? Be sensible ; let us say something .
ERV	Job	18	3	Why do you think we are stupid , like dumb cows ?
ERV	Job	18	4	Your anger is hurting no one but you . Do you think this world was made for you alone ? Do you think God should move mountains just to satisfy you ?
ERV	Job	18	5	“ Yes , the light of those who are evil will go out . Their fire will stop burning .
ERV	Job	18	6	The light in their houses will become dark . The lamps next to them will go out .
ERV	Job	18	7	Their steps , once strong and fast , become weak . Their own evil plans make them fall .
ERV	Job	18	8	Their own feet lead them into a net . They fall into its hidden pit and are caught .
ERV	Job	18	9	A trap catches them by the heel , and it holds them tight .
ERV	Job	18	10	A rope is hidden on the ground to trip them . A trap is waiting in their path .
ERV	Job	18	11	On every side terrors frighten them . Fears follow every step they take .
ERV	Job	18	12	Disaster is hungry for them . Ruin stands close by , waiting for them to fall .
ERV	Job	18	13	Diseases will eat away their skin . Death itself [ a ] will eat their arms and legs .
ERV	Job	18	14	They will be taken away from the safety of their tents and be led away to meet death , the king of terrors .
ERV	Job	18	15	Nothing will be left in their tents , which will be sprinkled with burning sulfur .
ERV	Job	18	16	Their roots below will dry up , and their branches above will die .
ERV	Job	18	17	People on earth will not remember them . Their names will be forgotten .
ERV	Job	18	19	They will leave behind no children , no descendants . None of their people will be left alive .
ERV	Job	18	20	People in the west will be shocked at what happened to them . People in the east will be numb with fear .
ERV	Job	18	21	This is what will happen to the homes of those who are evil . This is the place of those who don ’ t know God ! ” Footnotes - Job 18:13 Death itself Literally , “ Death ’ s firstborn , ” a name for a deadly disease , or the worms that eat a dead body .
ERV	Job	19	19	All my close friends hate me . Even my loved ones have turned against me .
ERV	Job	19	2	“ How long will you hurt me and crush me with your words ?
ERV	Job	19	3	You have insulted me ten times now . You have attacked me without shame !
ERV	Job	19	4	Even if I have sinned , it is my problem , not yours !
ERV	Job	19	5	You want me to look bad to make yourselves look good . You say my troubles are proof that I did wrong .
ERV	Job	19	6	I want you to know it was God who did this . He set this trap for me .
ERV	Job	19	7	I shout , ‘ He hurt me ! ’ but get no answer . No one hears my cry for fairness .
ERV	Job	19	8	God has blocked my way to keep me from getting through . He has hidden my path in darkness .
ERV	Job	19	9	He took away my honor . He took the crown from my head .
ERV	Job	19	10	He hits me on every side until I am worn out . He takes away my hope . It is like a tree pulled up by the roots .
ERV	Job	19	11	His anger burns against me . He treats me like an enemy .
ERV	Job	19	12	He sends his army to attack me . They build attack towers around me . They camp around my tent .
ERV	Job	19	13	“ God has made my brothers hate me . Those who knew me have become strangers .
ERV	Job	19	14	My relatives have left me . My friends have forgotten me .
ERV	Job	19	15	My servant girls and visitors in my home look at me as if I am a stranger and a foreigner .
ERV	Job	19	16	I call for my servant , but he does not answer . Even if I beg for help , he will not answer .
ERV	Job	19	17	My wife hates the smell of my breath . My own brothers hate me .
ERV	Job	19	18	Even little children make fun of me . When I get up , they say bad things about me .
ERV	Job	19	20	“ I am so thin , my skin hangs loose on my bones . I have little life left in me .
ERV	Job	19	21	“ Pity me , my friends , pity me , because God is against me .
ERV	Job	19	22	Why do you persecute me as God does ? Don ’ t you get tired of hurting me ?
ERV	Job	19	23	“ I wish someone would write down everything I say . I wish my words were written on a scroll .
ERV	Job	19	24	I wish they were carved with an iron tool into lead or scratched on a rock so that they would last forever .
ERV	Job	19	25	I know that there is someone to defend me and that he lives ! And in the end , he will stand here on earth and defend me .
ERV	Job	19	26	even after my skin has been destroyed . But I want to see God while I am still in my body .
ERV	Job	19	27	I want to see him with my own eyes , not through someone else ’ s eyes . And I can not tell you how much I want this to happen ! ”
ERV	Job	19	28	“ Maybe you will say , ‘ How can we push Job a little harder and make him realize that he is the source of his problems ? ’
ERV	Job	19	29	But you need to worry about your own punishment . God might use the sword against you ! Then you will know there is a time for judgment. ” Footnotes - Job 19:27 Or “ And in the end , he will stand here on earth and defend me ,
ERV	Job	20	20	“ The evil man is never satisfied . But the things he wants can not save him .
ERV	Job	20	2	“ You upset me , so I must answer you . I must tell you what I am thinking .
ERV	Job	20	3	You insulted me with your answers ! But I am wise and know how to answer you . 4-5 “ You know that the joy of the wicked does not last long . That has been true a long time , ever since Adam was [ a ] put on earth . Those who don ’ t know God are happy for only a short time .
ERV	Job	20	6	Maybe an evil man ’ s pride will reach up to the sky , and his head will touch the clouds .
ERV	Job	20	7	But he will be gone forever like his own body waste . People who knew him will say , ‘ Where is he ? ’
ERV	Job	20	8	Like a dream , he will fly away , never to be found . He will be chased away like a bad dream . [ b ]
ERV	Job	20	9	Those who knew him before will not see him again . His family will never again get to see him .
ERV	Job	20	10	His children will have to give back what he took from the poor . His own hands will give up his wealth .
ERV	Job	20	11	When he was young , his bones were strong , but , like the rest of his body , they will soon lie in the dirt .
ERV	Job	20	12	“ Evil tastes sweet in his mouth . He keeps it under his tongue to enjoy it fully .
ERV	Job	20	13	He hates to let it go and holds it in his mouth .
ERV	Job	20	14	But that evil will turn sour in his stomach . It will be like a snake ’ s bitter poison inside him .
ERV	Job	20	15	The evil man will spit out the riches he has swallowed . God will make him vomit them up .
ERV	Job	20	16	What he drank will be like a snake ’ s poison ; it will kill him like the bite of a deadly snake .
ERV	Job	20	17	He will never again enjoy so much wealth— rivers flowing with honey and cream . [ c ]
ERV	Job	20	18	He will be forced to give back his profits . He will not be allowed to enjoy what he worked for ,
ERV	Job	20	19	because he hurt the poor and left them with nothing . He took houses he did not build .
ERV	Job	20	21	After filling himself , there is nothing left . His success will not continue .
ERV	Job	20	22	Even while he has plenty , he will be pressed down with trouble . His problems will come down on him !
ERV	Job	20	23	If he does get all he wants , God will throw his burning anger against him . God will attack him and rain down punishment on him .
ERV	Job	20	24	Maybe he will run away from an iron sword , but then a bronze arrow [ d ] will strike him down .
ERV	Job	20	25	It will go through his body and stick out of his back . Its shining point will pierce his liver , and he will be shocked with terror .

ERV	Job	21	21	When their life is finished and they are dead , they will not care about the family they leave behind .
ERV	Job	21	2	“ Listen to what I say . Let this be your way of comforting me .
ERV	Job	21	3	Be patient while I speak . Then after I have finished speaking , you may make fun of me .
ERV	Job	21	4	“ My complaint is not against people . There is a good reason why I am not patient .
ERV	Job	21	5	Look at me and be shocked . Put your hand over your mouth , and stare at me in shock !
ERV	Job	21	6	When I think about what happened to me , I feel afraid and my body shakes !
ERV	Job	21	7	Why do evil people live long lives ? Why do they grow old and successful ?
ERV	Job	21	8	They watch their children grow up and live to see their grandchildren .
ERV	Job	21	9	Their homes are safe and free from fear . God does not punish them .
ERV	Job	21	10	Their bulls never fail to mate . Their cows have healthy calves .
ERV	Job	21	11	They send their children out to play like lambs . Their children dance around .
ERV	Job	21	12	They sing and dance to the sound of harps and flutes .
ERV	Job	21	13	Evil people enjoy success during their lives and then go to the grave without suffering .
ERV	Job	21	14	They say to God , ‘ Leave us alone ! We don ’ t care what you want us to do ! ’
ERV	Job	21	15	And they say , ‘ Who is God All-Powerful ? We don ’ t need to serve him ! It will not help to pray to him ! ’
ERV	Job	21	16	“ Of course , evil people don ’ t make their own success . I would never follow their advice .
ERV	Job	21	17	But how often does God blow out their light ? How often does trouble come to them ? How often does God get angry with them and punish them ?
ERV	Job	21	18	Does God blow them away , as the wind blows straw or as strong winds blow the grain husks ?
ERV	Job	21	19	But you say , ‘ God is saving their punishment for their children. ’ No ! Let God punish the evil people themselves so that they will know what they have done !
ERV	Job	21	20	Let them see their own punishment . Let them feel the anger of God All-Powerful .
ERV	Job	21	22	“ No one can teach God anything he doesn ’ t already know . God judges even those in high places .
ERV	Job	21	23	One person dies after living a full and successful life , a life completely safe and comfortable ,
ERV	Job	21	24	with a body that was well fed and bones that were still strong .
ERV	Job	21	25	But another person dies after a hard life that has made them bitter , never having enjoyed anything good .
ERV	Job	21	26	In the end , both of these people will lie together in the dirt . The worms will cover them both .
ERV	Job	21	27	“ But I know what you are thinking , and I know you want to hurt me .
ERV	Job	21	28	You might say , ‘ Show me a good man ’ s house . Now , show me where evil people live. ’ [ a ]
ERV	Job	21	29	“ Surely you have talked with travelers . Surely you will accept their stories .
ERV	Job	21	30	Evil people are spared when disaster comes . They survive when God shows his anger .
ERV	Job	21	31	No one criticizes them to their faces for how they lived . No one punishes them for the evil they have done .
ERV	Job	21	32	When they are carried to the grave , they will have someone to watch over the place they are buried .
ERV	Job	21	33	So even the soil in the valley will be pleasant for them , and thousands of people will join their funeral procession .
ERV	Job	21	34	“ So your empty words are no comfort to me . There is no truth at all in your answers ! ” Footnotes - Job 21:28 Show me … live Or “ Show me a wicked ruler ’ s house . Show me where evil people live . ”
ERV	Job	22	22	Accept his teaching . Pay attention to what he says .
ERV	Job	22	2	“ Does God need our help ? Even the wisest of us is not really useful to him .
ERV	Job	22	3	Does your living right benefit him ? Does God All-Powerful gain anything if you follow him ?
ERV	Job	22	4	Why does God blame and punish you ? Is it because you worship him ?
ERV	Job	22	5	No , it is because you sin so much . You never stop sinning .
ERV	Job	22	6	Maybe to guarantee loans you took things from people for no reason . Maybe you took a poor man ’ s clothes to make sure he paid you back . [ a ]
ERV	Job	22	7	Maybe you failed to give water or food to people who were tired or hungry .
ERV	Job	22	8	You have a lot of farmland , and people respect you .
ERV	Job	22	9	But maybe you sent widows away without giving them anything . And maybe you took advantage of orphans .
ERV	Job	22	10	That is why traps are all around you , and sudden trouble makes you afraid .
ERV	Job	22	11	That is why it is so dark you can not see , and why a flood of water covers you .
ERV	Job	22	12	“ God lives in the highest part of heaven and looks down on the highest stars .
ERV	Job	22	13	But you might say , ‘ What does God know ? Can he see through the dark clouds to judge us ?
ERV	Job	22	14	Thick clouds hide us from his eyes , so he can not see us as he walks around the edge of the sky. ’
ERV	Job	22	15	“ Job , you are walking on the old path that evil people walked on long ago .
ERV	Job	22	16	They were destroyed before it was their time to die . They were washed away by the flood .
ERV	Job	22	17	They told God , ‘ Leave us alone ! ’ and said , ‘ God All-Powerful can not do anything to us ! ’
ERV	Job	22	18	And it was God who filled their houses with good things . No , I would never follow the advice of evil people .
ERV	Job	22	19	Those who do what is right are happy to see them destroyed . The innocent laugh at them and say ,
ERV	Job	22	20	‘ Surely our enemies are destroyed ! Their wealth burned up in the fire ! ’
ERV	Job	22	21	“ Now , Job , give yourself to God and make peace with him . Do this , and you will get many good things .
ERV	Job	22	23	If you return to God All-Powerful , you will be restored . But remove the evil from your house .
ERV	Job	22	24	Think of your gold as nothing but dirt . Think of your finest gold as rocks from a stream .
ERV	Job	22	25	And let God All-Powerful be your gold . Let him be your pile of silver .
ERV	Job	22	26	Then you will enjoy God All-Powerful , and you will look up to him .
ERV	Job	22	27	When you pray , he will hear you . And you will be able to do all that you promised him .
ERV	Job	22	28	If you decide to do something , it will be successful . And your future will be very bright !
ERV	Job	22	29	When people are brought down and you ask God to help them , he will rescue those who have been humbled .
ERV	Job	22	30	Even those who are guilty will be forgiven . They will be saved because you did what was right. ” Footnotes - Job 22:6 paid you back See Deut . 24:12-13 for rules about making loans to the poor .
ERV	Job	23	23	Then Job answered :
ERV	Job	23	2	“ I am still complaining today . I groan because God is still making me suffer .
ERV	Job	23	3	I wish I knew where to find him . I wish I knew how to go to where he lives .
ERV	Job	23	4	I would present my case to him . I would make my arguments to show that I am innocent .
ERV	Job	23	5	He could give his response , and I would understand . I would listen closely to what he says .
ERV	Job	23	6	Would God use his power against me ? No , he would listen to me !
ERV	Job	23	7	Since I am an honest man , he would let me tell my story . Then my Judge would set me free !
ERV	Job	23	8	“ If I go to the east , God is not there . If I go to the west , I still don ’ t see him .
ERV	Job	23	9	When he is working in the north , I don ’ t see him . When he turns to the south , I still don ’ t see him .
ERV	Job	23	10	But God knows me . He is testing me and will see that I am as pure as gold .
ERV	Job	23	11	I have always lived the way God wants . I have never stopped following him .
ERV	Job	23	12	I always obey his commands . I love the words from his mouth more than I love my food .
ERV	Job	23	13	“ But God never changes , and who can stand against him ? He does anything he wants .
ERV	Job	23	14	He will do to me what he planned , and he has many other plans for me .
ERV	Job	23	15	That is why I am terrified to stand before him . Just thinking about it makes me afraid .
ERV	Job	23	16	The fear of God has made me lose my courage . God All-Powerful makes me afraid .
ERV	Job	23	17	What has happened to me is like a dark cloud over my face . But the darkness will not keep me quiet .
ERV	Job	24	24	They might be successful for a while , but then they will be gone . Like everyone else , they will be cut down like grain. ’
ERV	Job	24	2	“ People move property markers to get more of their neighbor ’ s land . People steal flocks and lead them to other grasslands .
ERV	Job	24	3	They steal a donkey that belongs to an orphan . They take a widow ’ s cow until she pays what she owes them .
ERV	Job	24	9	[ a ] They take a nursing baby from its mother . They take a poor person ’ s child to guarantee a loan .
ERV	Job	24	4	They force the poor to move out of their way and to get off the road .
ERV	Job	24	5	“ The poor are like wild donkeys that go out to the desert to find food . From morning to night they work to gather food for their children .
ERV	Job	24	6	They have to work in the fields , harvesting grain . They work for the rich , [ b ] gathering grapes in their vineyards .
ERV	Job	24	7	They must sleep all night without clothes . They have no covers to protect them from the cold .
ERV	Job	24	8	They are soaked with rain in the mountains . They stay close to the large rocks for shelter .
ERV	Job	24	10	They have no clothes , so they work naked . They carry piles of grain for others , but they go hungry .
ERV	Job	24	11	They press out olive oil and walk on grapes in the winepress , but they have nothing to drink .
ERV	Job	24	12	In the city you can hear the sad sounds of dying people . Those who are hurt cry out for help , but God does not listen .
ERV	Job	24	13	“ Some people rebel against the light . They don ’ t know what God wants . They don ’ t live the way he wants .
ERV	Job	24	14	A murderer gets up at dawn and kills poor , helpless people . And at night he becomes a thief .
ERV	Job	24	15	A man who commits adultery waits for the night to come . He thinks , ‘ No one will see me , ’ but still , he covers his face .
ERV	Job	24	16	When it is dark , evil people go out and break into houses . But during the day they lock themselves in their homes to avoid the light .
ERV	Job	24	17	The darkest night is their morning . They are friends with the terrors of darkness .
ERV	Job	24	18	“ You say , ‘ Evil people are taken away like things carried away in a flood . The land they own is cursed , so no one goes to work in their vineyards .
ERV	Job	24	19	As hot , dry weather melts away the winter snows , so the grave takes away those who have sinned .
ERV	Job	24	20	Their own mothers will forget them . Only the worms will want them . No one will remember them . They will be broken like a rotten stick !
ERV	Job	24	21	These evil people hurt women who have no children to protect them , and they refuse to help widows .
ERV	Job	24	22	By his power God removes the powerful . Even if they have a high position , they can not be sure of their lives .
ERV	Job	24	23	They might feel safe and secure , but God is watching how they live .
ERV	Job	24	25	“ I swear these things are true ! Who can prove that I lied ? Who can show that I am wrong ? ”
ERV	Job	25	25	Then Bildad from Shuah answered :
ERV	Job	25	2	“ God is the ruler . He makes people fear and respect him . He keeps peace in his kingdom above .
ERV	Job	25	3	No one can count his stars . [ a ] His sun rises on all people .
ERV	Job	25	4	How can anyone claim to be right before God ? No human being [ b ] can really be pure .
ERV	Job	25	5	In God ’ s eyes even the moon is not pure and bright ; even the stars are not pure .
ERV	Job	25	6	People are much less pure . They are like maggots , as worthless as worms ! ” Bible Gateway Recommends ERV Duotone Bible , Blue/Grey - Case of

ERV	Job	26	26	Then Job answered :
ERV	Job	26	2	“ Bildad , what a great help you are to this tired , weary man ! You have really supported me !
ERV	Job	26	3	You have given such wonderful advice to this foolish man ! You have provided so much useful information ! [ a ]
ERV	Job	26	4	Who helped you say these things ? Whose spirit inspired you to speak ?
ERV	Job	26	5	“ The ghosts and their neighbors in the underworld [ b ] shake with fear .
ERV	Job	26	6	But God can see clearly into that place of death . Death [ c ] is not hidden from God .
ERV	Job	26	7	God stretched the northern sky over empty space . He hung the earth on nothing .
ERV	Job	26	8	He fills the thick clouds with water . But he does not let its heavy weight break the clouds open .
ERV	Job	26	9	He covers the face of the full moon . He spreads his clouds over it and hides it .
ERV	Job	26	10	He drew the horizon on the ocean , like a circle where light and darkness meet .
ERV	Job	26	11	The foundations that hold up the sky shake with fear when God threatens them .
ERV	Job	26	12	With his own power God calmed the sea . With his wisdom he destroyed Rahab .
ERV	Job	26	13	His breath made the skies clear . His hand destroyed the snake that tried to get away . [ d ]
ERV	Job	26	14	These are only a few of the amazing things God has done . We hear only a small whisper of God ’ s thundering power. ” Footnotes - Job 26:3 Job is being sarcastic here—showing by the way he speaks that he does not really mean it . - Job 26:5 The ghosts … underworld Literally , “ The ghosts under the water. ” This refers to Sheol , the place of death . - Job 26:6 Death Or “ Abaddon , ” a Hebrew name meaning “ death ” or “ destruction. ” See Rev . 9:11 . - Job 26:13 snake … get away Or “ the escaping monster. ” This might be another name for Rahab . See Isa . 27:1 .
ERV	Job	27	27	Job continued his answer :
ERV	Job	27	2	“ God All-Powerful has been unfair to me ; he has made my life bitter . But I swear by his life ,
ERV	Job	27	3	as long as I have life in me , as long as breath from God is in my nostrils ,
ERV	Job	27	4	I will not be a hypocrite . I will not lie .
ERV	Job	27	5	You will never hear me say you men are right ! Until the day I die I will not be untrue to myself .
ERV	Job	27	6	I will hold on to my innocence and never let go ! My conscience will always be clear !
ERV	Job	27	7	May my enemies be punished like those who are evil . May those who stood against me end up like all who have done wrong .
ERV	Job	27	8	What hope do people without God have when it is time to die , when God takes their life away ?
ERV	Job	27	9	When they have troubles and cry out for help , God will not listen to them !
ERV	Job	27	10	It will be too late for them to enjoy talking with God All-Powerful . They should have prayed to God all the time .
ERV	Job	27	11	“ I will teach you about God ’ s power . I will not hide anything about God All-Powerful .
ERV	Job	27	12	But you have seen it all with your own eyes . So why do you say such useless things ?
ERV	Job	27	13	[ a ] “ Here is what God has planned for those who are evil . This is what cruel people will get from God All-Powerful .
ERV	Job	27	14	They may have many children , but all of them will be killed in war . Or their children will not have enough to eat .
ERV	Job	27	15	All those who are left will die , and the widows will not even cry for them .
ERV	Job	27	16	Evil people collect silver as easily as dirt . They may have so many clothes that they are piled up like clay .
ERV	Job	27	17	But their piles of clothes will be worn by those who have lived right . All that silver will be given to those who have done no wrong .
ERV	Job	27	18	Evil people might build houses , but they will not last long . They will be like a spider ’ s web or a guard ’ s tent .
ERV	Job	27	19	They might be rich when they go to bed , but when they open their eyes , all their riches will be gone .
ERV	Job	27	20	Terrible fears will come over them like a flood , like a storm in the night that blows everything away .
ERV	Job	27	21	The east wind will carry them away , and they will be gone . The storm will sweep them out of their homes .
ERV	Job	27	22	They may try to run away from the power of the storm , but it will come down on them without mercy .
ERV	Job	27	23	It will make a sound like clapping hands as they run away . It will whistle at them as they run from their homes. ” Footnotes - Job 27:13 Though Zophar is not mentioned in the text , many scholars think he answers Job in verses 13-23 .
ERV	Job	28	28	Then he said to humans , ‘ To fear and respect the Lord is wisdom . To turn away from evil is understanding . ’ ”
ERV	Job	28	2	Iron is dug out of the ground , and copper is melted out of the rocks .
ERV	Job	28	3	Miners carry lights deep into caves to search for these rocks in the deepest darkness .
ERV	Job	28	4	Far from where people live , they dig deep into the ground , down where no one else has been before . There they work all alone , hanging from ropes .
ERV	Job	28	5	Food grows on the ground above . But underground it is different , as if everything were melted by fire .
ERV	Job	28	6	In the rocks there are sapphires and grains of pure gold .
ERV	Job	28	7	Wild birds know nothing about the way to these places . No falcon [ a ] has ever seen it .
ERV	Job	28	8	Wild animals have never been there . Lions have not traveled that way .
ERV	Job	28	9	Miners dig the hardest rocks . They dig away at the mountains and make them bare .
ERV	Job	28	10	They cut tunnels through the rocks and see all the treasures they hold .
ERV	Job	28	11	They even find places where rivers begin . They bring to light what once was hidden .
ERV	Job	28	12	“ But where can anyone find wisdom ? Where can we get understanding ?
ERV	Job	28	13	People don ’ t know where wisdom is . It can not be found by anyone on earth .
ERV	Job	28	14	The deep ocean says , ‘ It ’ s not here with me. ’ The sea says , ‘ It ’ s not here with me. ’
ERV	Job	28	15	You can not buy wisdom with even the purest gold . There ’ s not enough silver in the world to pay for it .
ERV	Job	28	16	You can not buy it with gold from Ophir or with precious onyx or sapphires .
ERV	Job	28	17	Wisdom is worth more than gold or crystal . It can not be bought with expensive jewels set in gold .
ERV	Job	28	18	It is far more valuable than coral and jasper , more precious than rubies .
ERV	Job	28	19	The topaz from Ethiopia can not match its value , which is greater than the purest gold .
ERV	Job	28	20	“ So where does wisdom come from ? Where can we find understanding ?
ERV	Job	28	21	Wisdom is hidden from every living thing on earth . Even birds in the sky can not see it .
ERV	Job	28	22	Death and destruction [ b ] say , ‘ We have never seen wisdom ; we have only heard rumors about it. ’
ERV	Job	28	23	“ Only God knows the way to wisdom . Only he knows where wisdom is .
ERV	Job	28	24	He can see to the very ends of the earth . He sees everything under the sky .
ERV	Job	28	25	God gave the wind its power . He decided how big to make the oceans .
ERV	Job	28	26	He decided where to send the rain and where the thunderstorms should go .
ERV	Job	28	27	He looked at wisdom and discussed it . He examined it and saw how much it is worth .
ERV	Job	29	29	Job continued to speak :
ERV	Job	29	2	“ I wish my life could be the same as it was a few months ago , when God watched over me and cared for me .
ERV	Job	29	3	God ’ s light shined above me , so I could walk through the darkness .
ERV	Job	29	4	I wish for the days when I was successful , when I enjoyed God ’ s friendship and blessing in my home .
ERV	Job	29	5	God All-Powerful was still with me then , and my children were all around me .
ERV	Job	29	6	Life was so good that I washed my feet in cream and had plenty of the finest oils . [ a ]
ERV	Job	29	7	“ Those were the days when I went to the city gate and sat in the public meeting of the elders .
ERV	Job	29	8	When the young men saw me coming , they stepped out of my way . And the old men stood up to show they respected me .
ERV	Job	29	9	The leaders of the people stopped talking and put their hands over their mouths .
ERV	Job	29	10	Even the most important leaders were quiet , as if their tongues were stuck to the roof of their mouths .
ERV	Job	29	11	All who heard me said good things about me . Those who saw what I did praised me ,
ERV	Job	29	12	because I helped the poor when they cried out . I helped the orphans who had no one to care for them .
ERV	Job	29	13	People who were dying asked God to bless me . My help brought joy to widows in need .
ERV	Job	29	14	Right living was my clothing . Fairness was my robe and turban .
ERV	Job	29	15	I was like eyes for the blind , like feet for the crippled .
ERV	Job	29	16	I was like a father to the poor . I helped people I didn ’ t even know win their case in court .
ERV	Job	29	17	I stopped evil people from abusing their power and saved innocent people from them . [ b ]
ERV	Job	29	18	“ I always thought I would live a long life , growing old with my family around me .
ERV	Job	29	19	I was like a healthy plant with roots that have plenty of water and branches that are wet with dew .
ERV	Job	29	20	I thought each new day would bring more honor and be full of new possibilities . [ c ]
ERV	Job	29	21	“ In the past people listened to me . They waited quietly for my advice .
ERV	Job	29	22	When I finished speaking , they had nothing more to say . My words fell gently on their ears .
ERV	Job	29	23	They waited for my words as they would for rain . They drank them in like rain in the springtime .
ERV	Job	29	24	I smiled at them , and they could hardly believe it . My smile made them feel better .
ERV	Job	29	25	I was their leader and made decisions about their future . I was like a king among his troops , comforting those who were sad . Footnotes - Job 29:6 had plenty of the finest oils Literally , “ Around the anointed rock near me were streams of oil. ” This probably means Job had so much olive oil that there were streams of oil running down the altar from the part Job gave as a gift to God . - Job 29:17 Literally , “ I shattered the teeth of the crooked and snatched the victims from their teeth. ” - Job 29:20 Literally , “ My glory is new with me and my bow in my hand renewed. ” The words “ glory ” and “ bow ” might both refer to a rainbow—the promise of good weather after a storm . Or this might be understood as , “ My soul feels new every day , my hand always strong enough to shoot a new bow . ”
ERV	Job	30	30	My skin is burned and peeling away . My body is hot with fever .
ERV	Job	30	2	Their fathers are still too weak to be of any use to me . All their strength is gone .
ERV	Job	30	3	They are starving with nothing to eat , so they chew on the dry , ruined land .
ERV	Job	30	4	They pull up salt plants in the desert and eat the roots from the broom tree .
ERV	Job	30	5	They are forced away from other people , who shout at them as if they were thieves .
ERV	Job	30	6	They must live in the dry riverbeds , hillside caves , and holes in the ground .
ERV	Job	30	7	They howl in the bushes and huddle together under thornbushes .
ERV	Job	30	8	They are a bunch of worthless people without names , who were forced to leave their country .
ERV	Job	30	9	“ Now their sons sing songs to make fun of me . My name has become a bad word to them .
ERV	Job	30	10	They hate me and stay far away from me , except when they come to spit in my face !
ERV	Job	30	11	God has taken the string from my bow and made me weak , so they feel free to do whatever they want to me .
ERV	Job	30	12	They attack me on my right side . They knock my feet out from under me . They build ramps to attack and destroy me like a city .
ERV	Job	30	13	They guard the road so that I can not escape . They succeed in destroying me , without help from anyone .
ERV	Job	30	14	They break a hole in the wall and come rushing through it , and the crashing rocks fall on me .
ERV	Job	30	15	I am shaking with fear . They chased my honor away like dust in the wind . My safety disappears like a cloud .
ERV	Job	30	16	“ Now my life is almost gone , and soon I will die . Days of suffering have grabbed me .
ERV	Job	30	17	All my bones ache at night . Pain never stops chewing on me .
ERV	Job	30	18	God grabbed the collar of my coat and twisted my clothes out of shape .
ERV	Job	30	19	He threw me into the mud , and I became like dust and ashes .
ERV	Job	30	20	“ God , I cry out to you for help , but you don ’ t answer . I stand up and pray , but you don ’ t pay attention to me .
ERV	Job	30	21	You have become cruel to me ; you use your power to hurt me .
ERV	Job	30	22	You let the strong wind blow me away . You throw me around in the storm .
ERV	Job	30	23	I know you will lead me to my death , to that place where all the living must go .
ERV	Job	30	24	“ Surely no one would attack a man who is already ruined , when he is hurt and crying for help .
ERV	Job	30	25	God , you know that I cried for those who were in trouble . You know that I mourned for the poor .
ERV	Job	30	26	But when I hoped for good , trouble came instead . When I looked for light , darkness came .
ERV	Job	30	27	I constantly feel upset . And my suffering has only just begun .
ERV	Job	30	28	I am always sad and depressed , without any relief . I stand up in the public meeting and cry for help ,
ERV	Job	30	29	making sad sounds like the wild dogs , like the ostriches in the desert .
ERV	Job	30	31	My harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow . My flute makes sad sounds like someone crying .
ERV	Job	31	31	The people in my house know that I have never let anyone go hungry .
ERV	Job	31	2	What does God above have for us ? How does God All-Powerful repay people from his home high in heaven ? [ a ]
ERV	Job	31	3	He sends trouble to the wicked and disaster to those who do wrong .
ERV	Job	31	4	God is the one who knows what I do and sees every step I take .
ERV	Job	31	5	“ I have not lied to anyone . I never tried to cheat people .
ERV	Job	31	6	If God would use accurate scales , [ b ] he would know that I am innocent .
ERV	Job	31	7	If I ever stepped off the right path , if my eyes led my heart to do evil , or if my hands are dirty with sin ,
ERV	Job	31	8	then let others eat what I planted . Let my crops be pulled up by the roots .
ERV	Job	31	9	“ If I have desired another woman or waited at my neighbor ’ s door to sin with his wife ,
ERV	Job	31	10	then let my wife serve someone else , and let other men sleep with her .
ERV	Job	31	11	To do such a thing would be shameful , a sin that must be punished .
ERV	Job	31	12	Such sin is like a fire that burns until it destroys everything . It would completely ruin my life ’ s work .
ERV	Job	31	13	“ If I refused to be fair to my slaves when they had a complaint against me ,
ERV	Job	31	14	then what will I do when I must face God ? What will I say when he asks me to explain what I did ?
ERV	Job	31	15	The one who made me in my mother ’ s womb also made them . God shaped us all inside our mothers .
ERV	Job	31	16	“ I have never refused to help the poor . I always gave widows what they needed .
ERV	Job	31	17	I have never been selfish with my food . I shared what I had with orphans .
ERV	Job	31	18	All my life I have been like a father to orphans and have taken care of widows .
ERV	Job	31	19	Whenever I found people suffering because they didn ’ t have clothes or saw a poor man with no coat ,
ERV	Job	31	20	I always gave them something to wear . I used the wool from my own sheep to make them warm . And they thanked me with all their heart .
ERV	Job	31	21	I never threatened an orphan , even when I knew I had support in court . [ c ]
ERV	Job	31	22	If I ever did that , may my arm be pulled from its socket and fall from my shoulder !
ERV	Job	31	23	But I didn ’ t do any of these bad things . I fear God ’ s punishment too much . His majesty scares me . [ d ]
ERV	Job	31	24	“ I have never trusted in riches . I never said even to pure gold , ‘ You are my hope. ’
ERV	Job	31	25	I have been wealthy , but that didn ’ t make me proud . I earned a lot of money , but that is not what made me happy .
ERV	Job	31	26	I have never worshiped the bright sun or the beautiful moon .
ERV	Job	31	27	I was never foolish enough to worship the sun and the moon .
ERV	Job	31	28	This is also a sin that must be punished . If I had worshiped them , I would have been unfaithful to God All-Powerful .
ERV	Job	31	29	“ I have never been happy when my enemies were destroyed . I have never laughed at my enemies when bad things happened to them .
ERV	Job	31	30	I have never let my mouth sin by cursing my enemies and wishing for them to die .
ERV	Job	31	32	I always invited strangers into my home so that they would not have to sleep in the streets .
ERV	Job	31	33	I have not tried to hide my sins as some people do . I have never hidden my guilt .
ERV	Job	31	34	I was never so afraid of what people might say or of making enemies that I kept my sins secret and avoided going out .
ERV	Job	31	35	“ How I wish someone would listen to me ! I will sign my name to all I have said . Now let God All-Powerful answer me . Let him make a list of what he thinks I did wrong .
ERV	Job	31	36	I would wear it around my neck . I would put it on my head like a crown .
ERV	Job	31	37	Then I could explain everything I have done . I could come to God with my head held high like a prince .
ERV	Job	31	38	“ I did not use my land in a wrong way . I never caused it to suffer .
ERV	Job	31	39	I always paid the workers for the food I got from the land . I never let any of them starve .
ERV	Job	31	40	If I ever did any of these bad things , let thorns and weeds grow in my fields instead of wheat and barley ! ” Job ’ s words are finished . Footnotes - Job 31:2 Or possibly , “ I made an agreement with my eyes not to look with desire at the Virgin or the sacred things that belong to God All-Powerful. ” Here , “ the Virgin ” refers to a goddess worshiped by the Canaanites . - Job 31:6 accurate scales Literally , “ scales of righteousness. ” As a wordplay , this could mean either “ accurate scales ” or “ scales that show a person is good. ” - Job 31:21 Or “ I never shook my fist at an orphan who was at the gate asking for help. ” - Job 31:23 His majesty … me Or “ I could not stand before his majesty . ”
ERV	Job	32	32	Then Job ’ s three friends gave up trying to answer him , because he was so sure that he was innocent .
ERV	Job	32	2	But there was a young man there named Elihu son of Barakel . He was a descendant of a man named Buz . Elihu was from the family of Ram . He became very angry because Job kept saying he was innocent—that he was right and God was wrong .
ERV	Job	32	3	Elihu was also angry with Job ’ s three friends because they could not answer him , and yet they still considered him guilty of doing wrong .
ERV	Job	32	4	Elihu was the youngest one there , so he had waited until everyone finished talking .
ERV	Job	32	5	But when he saw that Job ’ s three friends had nothing more to say , his anger forced him to speak .
ERV	Job	32	6	So here ’ s what Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said : “ I am only a young man , and you are all older . That is why I was afraid to tell you what I think .
ERV	Job	32	7	I thought to myself , ‘ Older people should speak first . They have lived many years , so they have learned many things. ’
ERV	Job	32	8	But it is the spirit in people , the breath from God All-Powerful , that makes them understand .
ERV	Job	32	9	Old men are not the only wise people . They are not the only ones who understand what is right .
ERV	Job	32	10	“ So please listen to me , and I will tell you what I think .
ERV	Job	32	11	I waited patiently while you men talked . I listened to the answers you gave as you searched for the right words .
ERV	Job	32	12	I listened carefully to what you said . Not one of you proved Job wrong . Not one of you answered his arguments .
ERV	Job	32	13	You men can not say that you have found wisdom . The answer to Job ’ s arguments must come from God , not people .
ERV	Job	32	14	Job was arguing with you , not me , so I will not use your arguments to answer him .
ERV	Job	32	15	“ Job , these men lost the argument . They don ’ t have anything more to say . They don ’ t have any more answers .
ERV	Job	32	16	I waited for them to answer you . But now they are quiet . They stand there with nothing more to say .
ERV	Job	32	17	So now I will give you my answer . Yes , I will tell you what I think .
ERV	Job	32	18	I have so much to say that I can not hold it in .
ERV	Job	32	19	I feel like a jar of wine that has never been opened . I am like a new wineskin ready to burst .
ERV	Job	32	20	I must speak so that I will feel better . I must answer your arguments .
ERV	Job	32	21	I will treat you the same as I would treat anyone else . I will not praise you to win your favor .
ERV	Job	32	22	I can not treat one person better than another . If I did , God my Maker would punish me !
ERV	Job	33	33	But if you have nothing to say , then listen to me . Be quiet , and I will teach you wisdom . ”
ERV	Job	33	2	I am ready to speak .
ERV	Job	33	3	My heart is honest , so my words are sincere . I will speak the truth about what I know .
ERV	Job	33	4	God ’ s Spirit made me . My life comes from God All-Powerful .
ERV	Job	33	5	Listen to me and answer if you can . Get your arguments ready to face me .
ERV	Job	33	6	You and I are the same before God . He used clay to make us both .
ERV	Job	33	7	Don ’ t be afraid of me . I will not be hard on you .
ERV	Job	33	8	“ But , Job , I heard what you said . These were your very words :
ERV	Job	33	9	‘ I am pure and innocent ; I did nothing wrong ; I am not guilty !
ERV	Job	33	10	But God found an excuse to attack me . He treats me like an enemy .
ERV	Job	33	11	He put chains on my feet and watches everything I do. ’
ERV	Job	33	12	“ But you are wrong about this , and I will prove it to you . God knows more than any of us . [ a ]
ERV	Job	33	13	You are arguing with God ! Why do you think he should explain everything to you ?
ERV	Job	33	14	But maybe God does explain what he does but speaks in ways that people don ’ t understand .
ERV	Job	33	15	He may speak in a dream , or in a vision at night , when people are in a deep sleep lying in their beds .
ERV	Job	33	16	He may whisper something in their ear , and they are frightened when they hear his warnings .
ERV	Job	33	17	God warns people to stop them from doing wrong and to keep them from becoming proud .
ERV	Job	33	18	He does this to save them from death . [ b ] He wants to keep them from being destroyed .
ERV	Job	33	19	“ Or those who are sick in bed might be suffering punishment from God . The pain that makes their bones ache might be a warning from him .
ERV	Job	33	20	They feel so bad they can not eat . Even the best food makes them sick .
ERV	Job	33	21	Their bodies might waste away until they become thin and all their bones stick out .
ERV	Job	33	22	They might be close to death , their lives about to end .
ERV	Job	33	23	But maybe one of God ’ s thousands of angels is watching over them , to speak for them and tell about the good things they have done .
ERV	Job	33	24	Maybe the angel will be kind and say to God , ‘ Save this one from the place of death ! I have found a way to pay for his life. ’
ERV	Job	33	25	Then that person ’ s body will become young and strong again . He will be as he was when he was young .
ERV	Job	33	26	He will pray and God will answer . He will worship God and shout with joy . He will again stand as right before God .
ERV	Job	33	27	He will tell everyone , ‘ I sinned . I changed good into bad , but God didn ’ t give me the punishment I deserved !
ERV	Job	33	28	God saved me from going down to the place of death . Now I can enjoy life again. ’
ERV	Job	33	29	“ God does all these things for people again and again .
ERV	Job	33	30	He wants them to be saved from death so that they can enjoy life .
ERV	Job	33	31	“ Job , pay attention and listen to me . Be quiet and let me talk .
ERV	Job	33	32	But if you have an answer , go ahead and speak . Tell me your argument . I would be happy to know that you are innocent !
ERV	Job	34	34	A wise person would listen to me . A wise person would say ,
ERV	Job	34	2	“ Listen to what I say , you wise men . Pay attention , you who know so much .
ERV	Job	34	3	Your tongue tastes the food it touches , and your ear tests the words it hears .
ERV	Job	34	4	So let us test these arguments and decide for ourselves what is right . Together we will learn what is good .
ERV	Job	34	5	Job says , ‘ I am innocent , and God is not being fair to me .
ERV	Job	34	6	I am right , but I am judged to be a liar . I have done no wrong , but I am badly hurt. ’
ERV	Job	34	7	“ Would anyone but Job say such things ? He has more thirst for insulting God than for water .
ERV	Job	34	8	He is a friend of evil people . He likes to spend time with the wicked .
ERV	Job	34	9	I know this because he says , ‘ You will gain nothing if you try to please God. ’
ERV	Job	34	10	“ You men can understand , so listen to me . God would never do what is evil ! God All-Powerful would never do wrong .
ERV	Job	34	11	He pays us back for what we have done . He gives us what we deserve .
ERV	Job	34	12	The truth is that God does no wrong . God All-Powerful is always fair .
ERV	Job	34	13	No one chose God to be in charge of the earth . No one gave him responsibility for the whole world .
ERV	Job	34	14	If God decided to take away his spirit and the breath of life he gave us ,
ERV	Job	34	15	then everything on earth would die . We would all become dust again .
ERV	Job	34	16	“ If you men are wise , you will listen to what I say .
ERV	Job	34	17	Can someone be a ruler if he hates justice ? Job , God is not only powerful , but he is fair . Do you think you can judge him guilty ?
ERV	Job	34	18	God is the one who says to kings , ‘ You are worthless ! ’ He says to leaders , ‘ You are evil ! ’
ERV	Job	34	19	He does not respect leaders more than other people . And he does not respect the rich more than the poor . God made everyone .
ERV	Job	34	20	Any of us can die suddenly , in the middle of the night . Anyone can get sick and pass away . Even powerful people die for no reason we can see .
ERV	Job	34	21	“ God watches what people do . He sees every step they take .
ERV	Job	34	22	There is no place dark enough for evil people to hide from God .
ERV	Job	34	23	God does not need to set a time for people to come before him and be judged .
ERV	Job	34	24	He does not have to ask questions when people do wrong , even if they are powerful leaders . He simply destroys them and chooses others to take their place .
ERV	Job	34	25	When he learns what people have done , he defeats them , and overnight they are gone .
ERV	Job	34	26	He will punish them for the evil they have done , and he will do it where everyone can see .
ERV	Job	34	27	He will do this because they rebelled against him and ignored what he wanted .
ERV	Job	34	28	They hurt the poor and made them cry to God for help . And he hears their cry !
ERV	Job	34	29	But if God decides not to help them , no one can judge him guilty . If he hides himself , no one can find him . He is the ruler over every person and nation .
ERV	Job	34	30	He keeps the wicked from ruling so that they will not bring harm to the people .
ERV	Job	34	31	“ A person should say to God , ‘ I am guilty ; I will not sin anymore .
ERV	Job	34	32	Show me the sins I am not able to see . If I have done wrong , I will not do it again. ’
ERV	Job	34	33	Job , you want God to reward you , but you refuse to change . It is your decision , not mine . Tell me what you think .
ERV	Job	34	35	‘ Job talks like an ignorant person . What he says doesn ’ t make sense ! ’
ERV	Job	34	36	I think Job should be punished even more , because he answers us like someone who is evil !
ERV	Job	34	37	He adds rebellion to his other sins . He sits there insulting us and arguing with God ! ”
ERV	Job	35	35	Elihu continued talking and said ,
ERV	Job	35	2	“ Job , it is not fair for you to say , ‘ I am more right than God , ’
ERV	Job	35	3	because you also ask him , ‘ What ’ s the use of trying to please you ? What good will it do me if I don ’ t sin ? ’
ERV	Job	35	4	“ Job , I want to answer you and your friends here with you .
ERV	Job	35	5	Look up at the sky . Look at the clouds , which are so much higher than you .
ERV	Job	35	6	If you sin , it does not hurt God . Even if your sins are too many to count , that does nothing to God .
ERV	Job	35	7	And if you are good , that does not help God . He gets nothing from you .
ERV	Job	35	8	Job , the good and bad things you do affect only other people like yourself .
ERV	Job	35	9	“ If people are being hurt , they cry out and beg for protection from those who hurt them .
ERV	Job	35	10	But they forget to say , ‘ Where is God , the one who made me ? He is the one who gives us songs to sing in the night .
ERV	Job	35	11	He is the one who makes us smarter than any animal on earth and wiser than any bird. ’
ERV	Job	35	12	“ Or if evil people ask God for help , he will not answer them , because they are too proud .
ERV	Job	35	13	God will not listen to their worthless begging . God All-Powerful will not pay attention to them .
ERV	Job	35	14	So , Job , God will not listen to you when you say that you don ’ t see him . You say you are waiting for your chance to meet with him and prove that you are innocent .
ERV	Job	35	15	“ Job thinks that God does not punish evil and that he pays no attention to sin .
ERV	Job	35	16	So he continues his worthless talking . Everything he has said shows he does not know what he is talking about . ”
ERV	Job	36	36	Elihu continued talking and said ,
ERV	Job	36	2	“ Be patient with me a little longer . God has a few more words that he wants me to say .
ERV	Job	36	3	I will share my knowledge with everyone . I will prove that my Maker is right .
ERV	Job	36	4	Job , I am telling the truth . I know what I am talking about .
ERV	Job	36	5	“ God is very powerful , but he does not hate people . He is very powerful , but he is also very wise .
ERV	Job	36	6	He will not let evil people live . He brings justice to the poor .
ERV	Job	36	7	He watches over those who live right . He lets them rule in high places .
ERV	Job	36	8	So if people are punished , if they are tied with chains and ropes , they did something wrong .
ERV	Job	36	9	And God will tell them what they did , that they sinned and were proud .
ERV	Job	36	10	He will force them to listen to his warning . He will command them to stop sinning .
ERV	Job	36	11	If they serve and obey him , he will make them successful and they will live a happy life .
ERV	Job	36	12	But if they refuse to obey him , they will be destroyed . They will die like fools .
ERV	Job	36	13	“ People who don ’ t care about God are always bitter . Even when he punishes them , they refuse to pray to him for help .
ERV	Job	36	14	They will die while they are still young , like the male prostitutes .
ERV	Job	36	15	God saves those who suffer by using their suffering . He uses their troubles to speak in a way that makes them listen .
ERV	Job	36	16	“ In fact , God wants to help you out of your troubles . He wants to take away your burdens that are crushing you . He wants to load your table with plenty of food .
ERV	Job	36	17	But you are full of this talk about guilt , judgment , and justice !
ERV	Job	36	18	Job , don ’ t let your anger fill you with doubt about God . And don ’ t let the price of forgiveness turn you away .
ERV	Job	36	19	Do you think your wealth will keep you out of trouble ? Will your great strength be of any help to you now ?
ERV	Job	36	20	Don ’ t be like those who wish darkness would come and hide them . They try to disappear into the night . [ a ]
ERV	Job	36	21	Job , don ’ t let your suffering cause you to choose evil . Be careful not to do wrong .
ERV	Job	36	22	“ Look , God ’ s power makes him great ! He is the greatest teacher of all .
ERV	Job	36	23	No one can tell him what to do . No one can say , ‘ God , you have done wrong. ’
ERV	Job	36	24	Remember to praise him for what he has done , as many others have done in song .
ERV	Job	36	25	Everyone can see what he has done , even people in faraway countries .
ERV	Job	36	26	Yes , God is great , but we can not understand his greatness . We don ’ t know how long he has lived .
ERV	Job	36	27	“ God takes up water from the earth and changes it into mist and rain .
ERV	Job	36	28	So the clouds pour out the water , and the rain falls on many people .
ERV	Job	36	29	No one can understand how he spreads the clouds out or how the thunder rumbles from his home in the sky .
ERV	Job	36	30	Look , he spreads lightning all over the sky and covers the deepest part of the ocean .
ERV	Job	36	31	He uses them to control the nations and to give them plenty of food .
ERV	Job	36	32	He grabs the lightning with his hands , and commands it to strike where he wants .
ERV	Job	36	33	The thunder warns that a storm is coming . So even the cattle know it is near . Footnotes - Job 36:20 The Hebrew text here is hard to understand .
ERV	Job	37	37	“ The thunder and lightning frighten me ; my heart pounds in my chest .
ERV	Job	37	2	Listen to God ’ s thundering voice ! Listen to the sound coming from his mouth .
ERV	Job	37	3	He sends his lightning to flash across the whole sky . It lights up the earth from one end to the other .
ERV	Job	37	4	After the flashes of lightning you can hear his roaring voice . He thunders with his wonderful voice ! And while his voice thunders , the lightning flashes continue .
ERV	Job	37	5	God ’ s thundering voice is amazing ! He does great things that we can not understand .
ERV	Job	37	6	He says to the snow , ‘ Fall on the earth. ’ And he says to the rain , ‘ Pour down on the earth. ’
ERV	Job	37	7	God does this to stop everyone ’ s work and to show the people he made what he can do .
ERV	Job	37	8	The animals run into their dens and stay there .
ERV	Job	37	9	Whirlwinds come from the south . The cold winds come from the north .
ERV	Job	37	10	God ’ s breath makes ice and freezes even large bodies of water .
ERV	Job	37	11	He fills the clouds with water and scatters his lightning through them .
ERV	Job	37	12	He orders the clouds to be blown all around the earth . The clouds do whatever he commands .
ERV	Job	37	13	He causes the clouds to punish people with floods or to water his earth and show his love .
ERV	Job	37	14	“ Job , stop for a minute and listen . Think about the wonderful things God does .
ERV	Job	37	15	Do you know how God controls the clouds ? Do you know how he makes his lightning flash ?
ERV	Job	37	16	Do you know how the clouds hang in the sky ? This is just one of the amazing works of the one who knows everything .
ERV	Job	37	17	All you know is that you sweat , your clothes stick to you , and all is still and quiet when the heat wave comes from the south .
ERV	Job	37	18	Can you help God spread out the sky and make it shine like polished brass ?
ERV	Job	37	19	“ Job , tell us what we should say to God ! We can not think of what to say because of our ignorance . [ a ]
ERV	Job	37	20	I would not tell God that I wanted to talk to him . That would be like asking to be destroyed .
ERV	Job	37	21	A person can not look at the sun . It is too bright as it shines in the sky after the wind blows the clouds away .
ERV	Job	37	22	In the same way God ’ s golden glory shines from the Holy Mountain . [ b ] He is surrounded by the brightest light .
ERV	Job	37	23	We have seen that God All-Powerful really is all powerful ! But he is just and never treats anyone unfairly . [ c ]
ERV	Job	37	24	That is why people fear and respect him . He shows no respect for those who think they are wise . ”
ERV	Job	38	38	The rain makes the dust become mud , and the clumps of dirt stick together .
ERV	Job	38	2	“ Who is this ignorant person saying these foolish things ? [ a ]
ERV	Job	38	3	Prepare yourself for an attack ! Get ready to answer the questions I will ask you .
ERV	Job	38	4	“ Where were you when I made the earth ? If you are so smart , answer me .
ERV	Job	38	5	And who decided how big the earth should be ? Who measured it with a measuring line ?
ERV	Job	38	6	What is the earth resting on ? Who put the first stone in its place
ERV	Job	38	7	when the morning stars sang together and the angels [ b ] shouted with joy ?
ERV	Job	38	8	“ Who closed the flood gates as the sea gushed from the womb ?
ERV	Job	38	9	Who covered it with clouds and wrapped it in darkness ?
ERV	Job	38	10	I set the limits for the sea and put it behind locked gates .
ERV	Job	38	11	I said to the sea , ‘ You can come this far , but no farther . This is where your proud waves will stop. ’
ERV	Job	38	12	“ Did you ever in your life command the morning to begin or the day to dawn ?
ERV	Job	38	13	Did you ever tell the morning light to grab the earth and shake those who are evil out of their hiding places ?
ERV	Job	38	14	The morning light makes the hills and valleys easy to see . When the daylight comes to the earth , the shapes of these places stand out like the folds of a coat . They take shape like soft clay that is pressed with a stamp .
ERV	Job	38	15	Evil people don ’ t like the daylight . When it shines bright , it keeps them from doing the bad things they do .
ERV	Job	38	16	“ Have you ever gone to the deepest parts of the sea ? Have you ever walked on the ocean bottom ?
ERV	Job	38	17	Has anyone shown you the gates to the world of the dead ? Have you ever seen those gates that lead to the dark place of death ?
ERV	Job	38	18	Do you really understand how big the earth is ? Tell me , if you know all this .
ERV	Job	38	19	“ Where does light come from ? Where does darkness come from ?
ERV	Job	38	20	Can you take them back to where they belong ? Do you know how to get there ?
ERV	Job	38	21	Surely you know these things , since you are so old and wise . You were alive when I made them , weren ’ t you ? [ c ]
ERV	Job	38	22	“ Have you ever gone into the storerooms where I keep the snow and the hail ?
ERV	Job	38	23	I save them there for times of trouble , for the times of war and battle .
ERV	Job	38	24	Have you ever gone to the place where the sun comes up , where it makes the east wind blow all over the earth ? [ d ]
ERV	Job	38	25	Who dug ditches in the sky for the heavy rain ? Who made a path for the thunderstorm ?
ERV	Job	38	26	Who makes it rain even in desert places where no one lives ?
ERV	Job	38	27	The rain gives that dry empty land all the water it needs , and grass begins to grow .
ERV	Job	38	28	Does the rain have a father ? Who produces the drops of dew ?
ERV	Job	38	29	Does ice have a mother ? Who gives birth to the frost ?
ERV	Job	38	30	That ’ s when the water freezes as hard as a rock . Even the deep sea freezes over !
ERV	Job	38	31	“ Can you tie up the Pleiades [ e ] ? Can you unfasten the belt of Orion [ f ] ?
ERV	Job	38	32	Can you bring out the other constellations [ g ] at the right times ? Can you lead out the Bear [ h ] with its cubs ?

ERV	Job	38	34	“ Can you shout at the clouds and command them to cover you with rain ?
ERV	Job	38	35	Can you give a command to the lightning ? Will it come to you and say , ‘ Here we are ; what do you want , sir ? ’ Will it go wherever you want it to go ?

ERV	Job	38	37	Who is wise enough to count the clouds and tip them over to pour out their rain ?
ERV	Job	38	39	“ Do you find food for the lions ? Do you feed their hungry babies ?
ERV	Job	38	40	No , they hide in their caves or wait in the grass , ready to attack their prey .

ERV	Job	39	2	Do you know how many months they must carry their babies ? Do you know when it is the right time for them to be born ?
ERV	Job	39	3	These animals lie down , they feel their birth pains , and their babies are born .
ERV	Job	39	4	Their babies grow strong out in the wild . Then they leave their mothers and never come back .
ERV	Job	39	5	“ Who let the wild donkeys go free ? Who untied their ropes and let them loose ?
ERV	Job	39	6	I let the wild donkey have the desert for a home . I gave the salt lands to them for a place to live .
ERV	Job	39	7	They are happy to be away from the noise of the city . They never have to listen to their drivers shouting at them .
ERV	Job	39	8	They live in the mountains . That is their pasture . That is where they look for food to eat .
ERV	Job	39	9	“ Will a wild bull agree to serve you ? Will he stay in your barn at night ?
ERV	Job	39	10	Will he let you put ropes on him to plow your fields ?
ERV	Job	39	11	A wild bull is very strong , but can you trust him to do your work ?
ERV	Job	39	12	Can you trust him to gather your grain and bring it to your threshing place ?
ERV	Job	39	13	“ An ostrich gets excited and flaps its wings , but it can not fly . Its wings and feathers are not like the wings of a stork .
ERV	Job	39	14	An ostrich lays her eggs on the ground and lets the sand keep them warm .
ERV	Job	39	15	The ostrich forgets that someone might step on her eggs or that a wild animal might break them .
ERV	Job	39	16	An ostrich leaves her little babies . She treats them as if they were not her own . If her babies die , she does not care that all her work was for nothing .
ERV	Job	39	17	That ’ s because I did not give wisdom to the ostrich . She is foolish , and I made her that way .
ERV	Job	39	18	But when the ostrich gets up to run , she laughs at the horse and its rider , because she can run faster than any horse .
ERV	Job	39	19	“ Did you give the horse its strength ? Did you put the mane [ a ] on its neck ?
ERV	Job	39	20	Did you make it able to jump like a locust or snort [ b ] so loudly that it scares people ?
ERV	Job	39	21	A horse is happy to be so strong . It scratches the ground with its foot and runs into battle .
ERV	Job	39	22	It laughs at fear ; nothing makes it afraid ! It does not run away from battle .
ERV	Job	39	23	The soldier ’ s quiver shakes on the horse ’ s side . The spear and weapons its rider carries shine in the sun .
ERV	Job	39	24	The horse gets very excited and races over the ground . [ c ] When it hears the trumpet blow , it can not stand still .
ERV	Job	39	25	When the trumpet sounds , it snorts , ‘ Hurray ! ’ It can smell the battle from far away and hear the shouts of commanders with all the other sounds of battle .
ERV	Job	39	26	“ Did you teach the hawk how to spread its wings and fly south [ d ] ?
ERV	Job	39	27	Are you the one who told the eagle [ e ] to fly high into the sky ? Did you tell it to build its nest high in the mountains ?
ERV	Job	39	28	It lives high on a peak at the top of a cliff . That is its fortress .
ERV	Job	39	29	From there it looks far into the distance , searching for its food .
ERV	Job	39	30	The eagles gather around dead bodies , and their young eat the blood . ”
ERV	Job	40	40	Then the Lord said to Job ,
ERV	Job	40	2	“ You wanted to argue with God All-Powerful . You wanted to correct me and prove that I was wrong . So give me your answer ! ”
ERV	Job	40	3	Then Job answered the Lord :
ERV	Job	40	4	“ I am not worthy to speak ! What can I say to you ? I can not answer you ! I will put my hand over my mouth .
ERV	Job	40	5	I spoke once , but I will not speak again . I spoke twice , but I will not say anything more. ”
ERV	Job	40	6	Then the Lord spoke to Job again from the storm :
ERV	Job	40	7	“ Brace yourself [ a ] and get ready to answer the questions I will ask you .
ERV	Job	40	8	“ Are you trying to show that I am unfair ? Are you trying to look innocent by saying that I am guilty ?
ERV	Job	40	9	Are your arms as strong as mine ? Do you have a voice like mine that is as loud as thunder ?
ERV	Job	40	10	If so , you can be proud and wear glory and honor like clothes .
ERV	Job	40	11	If you are as powerful as God , then show your anger ! Punish those who are proud and humble them .
ERV	Job	40	12	Yes , just look at the proud and make them humble . Crush those evil people where they stand .
ERV	Job	40	13	Bury them all in the dirt . Wrap their bodies up and put them in their graves .
ERV	Job	40	14	If you can do any of these things , then even I will praise you . And I will admit that you can save yourself by your own power .
ERV	Job	40	15	“ Look at the behemoth . [ b ] I made the behemoth , and I made you . He eats grass like a cow .
ERV	Job	40	16	But he has great strength in his body . The muscles in his stomach are powerful .
ERV	Job	40	17	His tail stands strong like a cedar tree . His leg muscles are very strong .
ERV	Job	40	18	His bones are as strong as bronze . His legs are like iron bars .
ERV	Job	40	19	The behemoth is the most amazing animal I made , but I can defeat him .
ERV	Job	40	20	He eats the grass that grows on the hills where the wild animals play .
ERV	Job	40	21	He lies under the lotus plants . He hides among the reeds of the swamp .
ERV	Job	40	22	The lotus plants hide him in their shade . He lives under the willow trees that grow near the river .
ERV	Job	40	23	If the river floods , the behemoth will not run away . He is not afraid if the Jordan River splashes on his face .
ERV	Job	40	24	No one can blind his eyes and capture him . No one can catch him in a trap .
ERV	Job	41	41	“ Can you catch Leviathan [ a ] with a fishhook ? Can you tie his tongue with a rope ?
ERV	Job	41	2	Can you put a rope through his nose or a hook through his jaw ?
ERV	Job	41	3	Will he beg you to let him go free ? Will he speak to you with gentle words ?
ERV	Job	41	4	Will he make an agreement with you and promise to serve you forever ?
ERV	Job	41	5	Will you play with Leviathan as you would play with a bird ? Will you put a rope on him so that your girls can play with him ?
ERV	Job	41	6	Will fishermen try to buy him from you ? Will they cut him into pieces and sell him to the merchants ?
ERV	Job	41	7	Can you throw spears into his skin or head ?
ERV	Job	41	8	“ If you ever lay a hand on Leviathan , you will never do it again ! Just think about the battle that would be !
ERV	Job	41	9	Do you think you can defeat him ? Well , forget it ! There is no hope . Just looking at him will scare you !
ERV	Job	41	10	No one is brave enough to wake him up and make him angry . “ Well , no one can challenge me either ! [ b ]
ERV	Job	41	11	I owe nothing to anyone . Everything under heaven belongs to me . [ c ]
ERV	Job	41	12	“ I will tell you about Leviathan ’ s legs , his strength , and his graceful shape .
ERV	Job	41	13	No one can pierce his skin . It is like armor ! [ d ]
ERV	Job	41	14	No one can force him to open his jaws . The teeth in his mouth scare people .
ERV	Job	41	15	His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together .
ERV	Job	41	16	They are so close to each other that no air can pass between them .
ERV	Job	41	17	The shields are joined to each other . They hold together so tightly that they can not be pulled apart .
ERV	Job	41	18	When Leviathan sneezes , it is like lightning flashing out . His eyes shine like the light of dawn .
ERV	Job	41	19	Burning torches come from his mouth . Sparks of fire shoot out .
ERV	Job	41	20	Smoke pours from his nose like burning weeds under a boiling pot .
ERV	Job	41	21	His breath sets coals on fire , and flames shoot from his mouth .
ERV	Job	41	22	His neck is very powerful . People are afraid and run away from him .
ERV	Job	41	23	There is no soft spot in his skin . It is as hard as iron .
ERV	Job	41	24	His heart is like a rock ; he has no fear . It is as hard as a millstone .
ERV	Job	41	25	When he gets up , even the strongest people [ e ] are afraid . They run away when he swings his tail .
ERV	Job	41	26	Swords , spears , and darts only bounce off when they hit him . These weapons don ’ t hurt him at all !
ERV	Job	41	27	He breaks iron as easily as straw . He breaks bronze like rotten wood .
ERV	Job	41	28	Arrows don ’ t make him run away . Rocks thrown at him seem as light as chaff .
ERV	Job	41	29	When a wood club hits him , it feels to him like a piece of straw . He laughs when anyone throws a spear at him .
ERV	Job	41	30	The skin on his belly is like sharp pieces of broken pottery . He leaves tracks in the mud like a threshing board .
ERV	Job	41	31	He stirs up the water like a boiling pot . He makes it bubble like a pot of boiling oil .
ERV	Job	41	32	When he swims , he leaves a sparkling path behind him . He stirs up the water and makes it white with foam .
ERV	Job	41	33	No animal on earth is like him . He is an animal made without fear .
ERV	Job	41	34	He looks down on the proudest of creatures . He is king over all the wild animals. ” Footnotes - Job 41:1 Leviathan This animal might be a crocodile or a giant sea monster . - Job 41:10 Well , no one … either Or “ No one can stand and fight him. ” - Job 41:11 Or “ No one has come near to Leviathan and survived—no one under heaven ! ” - Job 41:13 It is like armor Or “ No one can approach him with a bridle. ” - Job 41:25 strongest people Or “ gods . ”
ERV	Job	42	42	Then Job answered the Lord :
ERV	Job	42	2	“ I know you can do everything . You make plans , and nothing can change or stop them .
ERV	Job	42	3	You asked , ‘ Who is this ignorant person saying these foolish things ? ’ [ a ] I talked about things I did not understand . I talked about things too amazing for me to know .
ERV	Job	42	4	“ You said to me , ‘ Listen , and I will speak . I will ask you questions , and you will answer me. ’
ERV	Job	42	5	In the past I heard about you , but now I have seen you with my own eyes .
ERV	Job	42	6	And I am ashamed of myself . [ b ] I am so sorry . As I sit in the dust and ashes , [ c ] I promise to change my heart and my life. ” The Lord Gives Job ’ s Wealth Back
ERV	Job	42	7	After the Lord finished talking to Job , he spoke to Eliphaz from Teman . He said , “ I am angry with you and your two friends , because you did not tell the truth about me , as my servant Job did .
ERV	Job	42	8	So now , Eliphaz , get seven bulls and seven rams . Take them to my servant Job . Kill them and offer them as a burnt offering for yourselves . My servant Job will pray for you , and I will answer his prayer . Then I will not give you the punishment you deserve . You should be punished , because you were very foolish . You did not say what is right about me , as my servant Job did. ”
ERV	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz from Teman , Bildad from Shuah , and Zophar from Naamah obeyed the Lord . Then the Lord answered Job ’ s prayer .
ERV	Job	42	10	Job prayed for his friends , and the Lord made Job successful again . The Lord gave him twice as much as he had before .
ERV	Job	42	11	Then all his brothers and sisters and all the people who knew him before came to his house . They all ate a big meal with him . They comforted him and were sorry that the Lord had brought him so much trouble . Each person gave Job a piece of silver and a gold ring .
ERV	Job	42	12	The Lord blessed Job with even more than he had in the beginning . Job got 14,000 sheep ,
ERV	Job	42	6000	camels ,
ERV	Job	42	2000	oxen , and
ERV	Job	42	1000	female donkeys .
ERV	Job	42	13	He also got seven sons and three daughters .
ERV	Job	42	14	He named the first daughter Jemimah and the second daughter Keziah . He named the third daughter Keren Happuch .
ERV	Job	42	15	Job ’ s daughters were among the most beautiful women in all the country . And , like their brothers , they each got a share of their father ’ s property . [ d ]
ERV	Job	42	16	So Job lived for
ERV	Job	42	140	years more . He lived to see his children , his grandchildren , his great-grandchildren , and his great-great-grandchildren .
ERV	Job	42	17	Job lived to be a very old man who had lived a good , long life . Footnotes - Job 42:3 Who … things Or “ Who is this person darkening advice with ignorant words. ” - Job 42:6 I am ashamed of myself Or “ I take back what I said. ” - Job 42:6 dust and ashes People sat in dust and ashes to show that they were very sad about something . - Job 42:15 And … property Usually a person ’ s property was divided only among the sons , but here , even Job ’ s daughters got part of his property .
ERV	Psalms	1	1	Great blessings belong to those who don ’ t listen to evil advice , who don ’ t live like sinners , and who don ’ t join those who make fun of God . [ a ]
ERV	Psalms	1	2	Instead , they love the Lord ’ s teachings and think about them day and night .
ERV	Psalms	1	3	So they grow strong , like a tree planted by a stream— a tree that produces fruit when it should and has leaves that never fall . Everything they do is successful .
ERV	Psalms	1	4	But the wicked are not like that . They are like chaff that the wind blows away .
ERV	Psalms	1	5	When the time for judgment comes , the wicked will be found guilty . Sinners have no place among those who do what is right . [ b ]

ERV	Ecclesiastes	1	15	If something is crooked , you can not say it is straight . And if something is missing , you can not say it is there .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I said to myself , “ I am very wise . I am wiser than all the kings who ruled Jerusalem before me . I know what wisdom and knowledge really are. ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	1	17	.
ERV	Ecclesiastes	1	18	With much wisdom comes frustration . The one who gains more wisdom also gains more sorrow . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 1:2 meaningless … a waste of time The Hebrew word means “ vapor or breath ” or “ something that is useless , meaningless , empty , wrong , or a waste of time. ” - Ecclesiastes 1:3 in this life Literally , “ under the sun. ” Also in verses
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	2	It is foolish to laugh all the time . Having fun does not do any good .

ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	4	Then I began doing great things . I built houses , and I planted vineyards for myself .

ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made pools of water for myself , and I used them to water my growing trees .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I bought men and women slaves , and there were slaves born in my house . I owned many great things . I had herds of cattle and flocks of sheep . I owned more things than any other person in Jerusalem did .

ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	11	But then I looked at everything I had done and the wealth I had gained . I decided it was all a waste of time ! It was like trying to catch the wind . [ a ] There is nothing to gain from anything we do in this life . [ b ] Maybe Wisdom Is the Answer
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	12	Then I decided to think about what it means to be wise or to be foolish or to do crazy things . And I thought about the one who will be the next king . The new king will do the same as the kings before him . [ c ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	13	I saw that wisdom is better than foolishness in the same way that light is better than darkness .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	14	Wise people use their minds like eyes to see where they are going . But for fools , it is as if they are walking in the dark . I also saw that fools and wise people both end the same way .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	15	I thought to myself , “ The same thing that happens to a fool will also happen to me . So why have I tried so hard to become wise ? ” I said to myself , “ Being wise is also useless. ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	16	Whether people are wise or foolish , they will still die , and no one will remember either one of them forever . In the future , people will forget everything both of them did . So the two are really the same . Is There Real Happiness in Life ?
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	17	,
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	18	I began to hate all the hard work I had done , because I saw that the people who live after me would get the things that I worked for . I will not be able to take them with me .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	19	Some other person will control everything I worked and studied for . And I don ’ t know if that person will be wise or foolish . This is also senseless .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	20	So I became sad about all the work I had done .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	21	People can work hard using all their wisdom and knowledge and skill . But they will die and other people will get the things they worked for . They did not do the work , but they will get everything . That makes me very sad . It is also not fair and is senseless .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	22	. - Ecclesiastes 2:12 And I thought … before him The Hebrew text here is hard to understand . - Ecclesiastes 2:24 Or “
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	23	Throughout their life , they have pain , frustrations , and hard work . Even at night , a person ’ s mind does not rest . This is also senseless . 24-25 There is no one who has tried to enjoy life more than I have . And this is what I learned : The best thing people can do is eat , drink , and enjoy the work they must do . I also saw that this comes from God . [ d ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	26	. - Ecclesiastes 2:11 in this life Literally , “ under the sun. ” Also in verses
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	24	The best people can do is eat , drink , and enjoy their work . I also saw that this comes from God .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	2	25	No one can eat or enjoy life without God . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	3	There is a time to kill and a time to heal . There is a time to destroy and a time to build .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	2	There is a time to be born and a time to die . There is a time to plant and a time to pull up plants .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	4	There is a time to cry and a time to laugh . There is a time to be sad and a time to dance with joy .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	5	There is a time to throw weapons down and a time to pick them up . [ a ] There is a time to hug someone and a time to stop holding so tightly .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	6	There is a time to look for something and a time to consider it lost . There is a time to keep things and a time to throw things away .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	7	There is a time to tear cloth and a time to sew it . There is a time to be silent and a time to speak .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	8	There is a time to love and a time to hate . There is a time for war and a time for peace . God Controls His World
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	9	Do people really gain anything from their hard work ?
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I saw all the hard work God gave us to do .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	11	God gave us the ability to think about his world , [ b ] but we can never completely understand everything he does . And yet , he does everything at just the right time .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I learned that the best thing for people to do is to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	13	God wants everyone to eat , drink , and enjoy their work . These are gifts from God .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I learned that anything God does will continue forever . People can not add anything to the work of God , and they can not take anything away from it . God did this so that people would respect him .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	15	What happened in the past has happened , and what will happen in the future will happen . But God wants to help those who have been treated badly . [ c ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	16	I also saw these things in this life [ d ] : I saw that the courts should be filled with goodness and fairness , but there is evil there now .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	17	So I said to myself , “ God has planned a time for everything , and he has planned a time to judge everything people do . He will judge good people and bad people. ” Are People Like Animals ?
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I thought about what people do to each other . And I said to myself , “ God wants people to see that they are like animals .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	19	The same thing happens to animals and to people—they die . People and animals have the same ‘ breath. ’ [ e ] Is a dead animal different from a dead person ? It is all so senseless !
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	20	The bodies of people and animals end the same way . They came from the earth , and , in the end , they will go back to the earth .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knows what happens to a person ’ s spirit ? Who knows if a human ’ s spirit goes up to God while an animal ’ s spirit goes down into the ground ? ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So I saw that the best thing people can do is to enjoy what they do , because that is all they have . Besides , no one can help another person see what will happen in the future . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 3:5 Literally , “ There is a time to throw stones away and a time to gather stones. ” - Ecclesiastes 3:11 the ability … world Or “ a desire to know the future. ” - Ecclesiastes 3:15 Or “ What happens now also happened in the past . What happens in the future has also happened before . God makes things happen again and again. ” - Ecclesiastes 3:16 in this life Literally , “ under the sun. ” - Ecclesiastes 3:19 breath Or “ spirit . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	4	Then I thought , “ Why do people work so hard ? ” I saw people try to succeed and be better than other people . They do this because they are jealous . They don ’ t want other people to have more than they have . This is senseless . It is like trying to catch the wind . [ b ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	2	I decided that it is better for those who have died than for those who are still alive .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	3	And it is even better for those who die at birth , because they never saw the evil that is done in this world . [ a ] Why Work So Hard ?
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Some people say , “ It is foolish to fold your hands and do nothing . If you don ’ t work , you will starve to death. ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Maybe that is true . But I say it is better to be satisfied with the few things you have than to always be struggling to get more .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Again I saw something else that didn ’ t make sense :
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	8	I saw a man who has no family , not a son or even a brother . But he continues to work very hard . He is never satisfied with what he has . And he works so hard that he never stops and asks himself , “ Why am I working so hard ? Why don ’ t I let myself enjoy my life ? ” This is also a very bad and senseless thing . Friends and Family Give Strength
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two people are better than one . When two people work together , they get more work done .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	10	If one person falls , the other person can reach out to help . But those who are alone when they fall have no one to help them .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	11	If two people sleep together , they will be warm . But a person sleeping alone will not be warm .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	12	An enemy might be able to defeat one person , but two people can stand back-to-back to defend each other . And three people are even stronger . They are like a rope that has three parts wrapped together—it is very hard to break . People , Politics , and Popularity
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	13	A young leader who is poor but wise is better than a king who is old but foolish . That old king does not listen to warnings .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	14	Maybe the young ruler was born a poor man in the kingdom . And maybe he came from prison to rule the country .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	15	But I have watched people in this life , [ c ] and I know this : People will follow that young man . He will become the new king .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	4	16	. - Ecclesiastes 4:15 in this life Literally , “ under the sun . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	5	It is better to promise nothing than to promise something and not be able to do it .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Be careful when you make promises to God . Be careful about what you say to him . Don ’ t let your feelings cause you to speak too soon . God is in heaven , and you are on the earth . So you need to say only a few things to him . This saying is true :
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	3	Bad dreams come from too many worries , and too many words come from the mouth of a fool .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	4	If you make a promise to God , keep your promise . Don ’ t be slow to do what you promised . God is not happy with fools . Give God what you promised to give him .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	6	So don ’ t let your words cause you to sin . Don ’ t say to the priest , [ a ] “ I didn ’ t mean what I said. ” If you do this , God might become angry with your words and destroy everything you have worked for .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	7	You should not let your useless dreams and bragging bring you trouble . You should respect God . For Every Ruler There Is a Ruler
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	8	In some country you will see poor people who are forced to work very hard . You will see that this is not fair to them . It is against their rights . But don ’ t be surprised ! The ruler who forces them to work has another ruler who forces him . And there is still another ruler who forces both of these rulers .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	9	Even the king gets his share of the profit . The wealth of the country is divided among them. ” - Ecclesiastes 5:13 in this life Literally , “ under the sun. ” Also in 6:1 . - Ecclesiastes 5:13 for the future Or “ to their harm. ” - Ecclesiastes 5:20 God … to do Or “ God will do whatever he wants to them . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	10	Those who love money will never be satisfied with the money they have . Those who love wealth will not be satisfied when they get more and more . This is also senseless .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	11	The more wealth people have , the more “ friends ” they have to help spend it . So the rich really gain nothing . They can only look at their wealth .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	12	Those who work hard all day come home and sleep in peace . It is not important if they have little or much to eat . But the rich worry about their wealth and are not able to sleep .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	13	There is a very sad thing that I have seen happen in this life . [ c ] People save their money for the future . [ d ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	14	Then something bad happens and they lose everything . So they have nothing to give to their children .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	15	People come into the world with nothing . And when they die , they leave with nothing . They might work hard to get things , but they can not take anything with them when they die .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	16	It is very sad that people leave the world just as they came . So what does a person gain from “ trying to catch the wind ” ?
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	17	They only get days that are filled with sadness and sorrow . In the end , they are troubled , sick , and angry . Enjoy Your Life ’ s Work
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	18	I have seen what is best for people to do on earth : They should eat , drink , and enjoy the work they have during their short time here . God has given them these few days , and that is all they have .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	19	If God gives some people wealth , property , and the power to enjoy those things , they should enjoy them . They should accept the things they have and enjoy their work—that is a gift from God .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	5	20	People don ’ t have many years to live , so they must remember these things all their life . God will keep them busy with the work they love to do . [ e ] Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 5:6 priest Or “ angel ” or “ messenger. ” This might be an angel , a priest , or a prophet . - Ecclesiastes 5:9 The ruler … owns him Or “ One ruler is cheated by a higher ruler . And they are cheated by an even higher ruler .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	6	He might live
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	2	God gives some people great wealth , riches , and honor . They have everything they need and everything they could ever want . But then God does not let them enjoy those things . Some stranger comes and takes everything . This is a very bad and senseless thing .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	3	A man might live a long time and have
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	100	children . But if he is not satisfied with those good things , and if no one remembers him after his death , I say that a baby who dies at birth is better off than that man .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	4	It is senseless when a baby is born dead . The baby is quickly buried in a dark grave , without even a name .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	5	The baby never saw the sun and never knew anything . But the baby finds more rest than the man who never enjoyed what God gave him .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	2000	years . But if he does not enjoy life , then the baby who was born dead has found the easiest way to the same end . [ a ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	7	People work and work to feed themselves , but they are never satisfied .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	8	In the same way a wise person is no better than a fool is . It is better to be a poor person who knows how to accept life as it is .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	9	It is better to be happy with what you have than to always want more and more . Always wanting more and more is useless . It is like trying to catch the wind . [ b ] 10-11 You are only what you were created to be—a human , and it is useless to argue about it . People can not argue with God about this because he is more powerful than they are , and a long argument will not change that fact .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	6	12	Who knows what is best for people during their short life on earth ? Their life passes like a shadow . No one can tell them what will happen later . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 6:6 then the baby … the same end Or “ Isn ’ t it true that all go to the same place ? ” - Ecclesiastes 6:9 Or “ Having what you can see is better than chasing after the things you want . This is also like trying to catch the wind . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Even the wise will forget their wisdom , if someone pays them enough . That money destroys their understanding .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to a funeral than to a party , because everyone must die , and the living need to remember this .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Sorrow is even better than laughter , because when our face is sad , our heart becomes good .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	4	A wise person thinks about death , but a fool thinks only about having a good time .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better to be criticized by the wise than praised by the foolish .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	6	The laughter of fools is such a waste . It is like thorns burning under a pot . The thorns burn so quickly that the pot does not get hot . [ b ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	8	It is better to finish something than to start it . It is better to be gentle and patient than to be proud and impatient .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Don ’ t become angry quickly , because anger is foolish .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Don ’ t say , “ Life was better in the ‘ good old days. ’ What happened ? ” Wisdom does not lead us to ask that question .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is better if you also have property . Wise people [ c ] will get more than enough wealth .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom and money can protect you . But knowledge gained through wisdom is even better—it can save your life .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Look at what God has made . You can not change a thing , even if you think it is wrong .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When life is good , enjoy it . But when life is hard , remember that God gives us good times and hard times . And no one knows what will happen in the future . People Can not Really Be Good
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	15	In my short life , I have seen everything . I have seen good people die young , and I have seen evil people live long lives . 16-17 So why ruin your life ? Don ’ t be too good or too bad , and don ’ t be too wise or too foolish . Why should you die before your time ?
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	18	Try to be a little of this and a little of that . [ d ] Even God ’ s followers will do some good things and some bad things . 19-20 Surely there is no one on earth who always does good and never sins . But wisdom can make one person stronger than ten leaders in a city .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Don ’ t listen to everything people say . You might hear your own servant saying bad things about you .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	22	And you know that many times you too have said bad things about other people .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	23	I used my wisdom and thought about all these things . I wanted to be wise , but I couldn ’ t do it .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	24	I can not understand why things are as they are . It is too hard for anyone to understand .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I studied and I tried very hard to find true wisdom . I tried to find a reason for everything . I did learn that it is foolish to be evil , and it is crazy to act like a fool .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	26	I also found that some women are dangerous like traps . Their hearts are like nets , and their arms are like chains . It is worse than death to be caught by these women . God ’ s followers should run away from them . Let the sinners be caught by them . 27-28 The Teacher says , “ I added all this together to see what answer I could find . I am still looking for answers , but I did find this : I found one good man in a thousand . But I did not find even one good woman .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	7	29	“ There is one other thing I have learned . God made people good , but they have found many ways to be bad. ” Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 7:1 A good reputation … pleasures Literally , “ better a name than good perfume. ” This is a wordplay in Hebrew . The word for “ name ” and the word for “ perfume ” sound alike . - Ecclesiastes 7:6 Or “ The cackling of fools , like the crackling of thorns under a pot , is senseless. ” - Ecclesiastes 7:11 Wise people Literally , “ People who see the sun. ” This means wise people can see and plan what they should do . - Ecclesiastes 7:18 Try … of that Or “ Hold onto this , but don ’ t let go of that . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	8	No one has the power to keep their spirit from leaving or to stop their death . During war , no soldier has the freedom to go wherever he wants . In the same way evil does not allow anyone who does wrong to go free .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	2	I say you should always obey the king ’ s command . Do this because you made a promise to God .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Don ’ t be afraid to give suggestions to the king , and don ’ t support something that is wrong . But remember , the king gives the commands that please him .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	4	He has the authority to give commands , and no one can tell him what to do .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	5	People will be safe if they obey his command . But wise people know the right time to do this , and they also know when to do the right thing .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	6	There is a right time and a right way to do everything . You must decide what you should do , even when it might cause problems
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	7	and you are not sure what will happen . No one can tell you what will happen in the future .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	9	,
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	I also saw great and beautiful funerals for evil people . While the people were going home after the funeral services , they said good things about the evil people who had died . This happened even in the same towns where the evil people had done many bad things . This is senseless . Justice , Rewards , and Punishment
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	,
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	A sinner might do a hundred evil things and still live a long time . But I know that it is still better to obey and respect God .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	13	.
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is something else that happens on earth that does not seem fair . Bad things should happen to bad people , and good things should happen to good people . But sometimes bad things happen to good people , and good things happen to bad people . This is not fair .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I decided it was more important to enjoy life because the best thing people can do in this life [ a ] is to eat , drink , and enjoy life . At least that will help people enjoy the hard work God gave them to do during their life on earth . We Can not Understand All God Does
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	16	and 9:3 ,
ERV	Ecclesiastes	8	17	I also saw that no one can understand all that God does . People can try and try to understand the things that happen here on earth , but they can not . There may be wise people who claim to understand the meaning of these things , but they are wrong . No one can understand it all . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 8:15 in this life Literally , “ under the sun. ” Also in verse
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Enjoy life with the wife you love . Enjoy every day of your short life . God has given you this short life on earth—and it is all you have . So enjoy the work you have to do in this life .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	2	But , there is one thing that happens to everyone—we all die ! Death comes to good people and bad people . Death comes to those who are pure and to those who are not pure . Death comes to those who give sacrifices and to those who don ’ t give sacrifices . Good people will die just as sinners do . Those who make promises to God will die just as those who are afraid to make those promises .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	Of all the things that happen in this life , the worst thing is that all people end life the same way . But it is also very bad that people always think evil and foolish thoughts . And those thoughts lead to death .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	4	There is hope for those who are still alive—it does not matter who they are . But this saying is true : A living dog is better than a dead lion .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	5	The living know that they will die , but the dead don ’ t know anything . They have no more reward . People will soon forget them .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	6	After people are dead , their love , hate , and jealousy are all gone . And they will never again share in what happens on earth . Enjoy Life While You Can
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	7	So go and eat your food now and enjoy it . Drink your wine and be happy . It is all right with God if you do these things .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Wear nice clothes and make yourself look good .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Every time you find work to do , do it the best you can . In the grave there is no work . There is no thinking , no knowledge , and there is no wisdom . And we are all going to the place of death . Life Is Not Fair
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I also saw other things in this life that were not fair . The fastest runner does not always win the race ; the strongest soldier does not always win the battle ; wise people don ’ t always get the food ; smart people don ’ t always get the wealth ; educated people don ’ t always get the praise they deserve . When the time comes , bad things can happen to anyone !
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	You never know when hard times will come . Like fish in a net or birds in a snare , people are often trapped by some disaster that suddenly falls on them . The Power of Wisdom
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	I also saw a person doing a wise thing in this life , and it seemed very important to me .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a small town with a few people in it . A great king fought against that town and put his armies all around it .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	But there was a wise man in that town . He was poor , but he used his wisdom to save his town . After everything was finished , the people forgot about the poor man .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	16	But I still say that wisdom is better than strength . They forgot about the poor man ’ s wisdom , and the people stopped listening to what he said . But I still believe that wisdom is better .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	17	Words spoken by the wise are heard more clearly than those shouted by a leader among fools .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war , but one fool [ a ] can destroy much good . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 9:18 fool Literally , “ sinner . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	10	But wisdom will make any job easier . It is very hard to cut with a dull knife . But if you sharpen the knife , the job is easier .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	2	The thoughts of the wise lead them the right way , but the thoughts of the foolish lead them the wrong way .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Fools show how foolish they are , just walking down the road . Their minds are empty , and everyone knows it .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	4	Don ’ t quit your job simply because the boss is angry with you . If you remain calm and helpful , you can correct even great mistakes . [ a ]
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	5	Here is something else that I have seen in this life [ b ] that isn ’ t fair . It is the kind of mistake that rulers make .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	6	Fools are given important positions , while the rich get jobs that are not important .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants riding on horses , while rulers were walking beside them like slaves . Every Job Has Its Dangers
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	8	If you dig a hole , you might fall into it . If you break down a wall , you might be bitten by a snake .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	9	If you are moving large stones , you might be hurt by them . If you cut down a tree , you are in danger of it falling on you .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	11	Someone might know how to control snakes . But that skill is useless if a snake bites when that person is not around .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	12	Words from the wise bring praise , but words from a fool bring destruction .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	13	Fools begin by saying something foolish . But in the end , they speak nonsense .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	14	Fools are always talking about what they will do , but you never know what will happen . People can not tell what will happen in the future .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	15	Fools aren ’ t smart enough to find their way home , so they must work hard all their lives . The Value of Work
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	16	It is very bad for a country if the king is like a child . And it is very bad for a country if its rulers use all their time eating .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	17	But it is very good for a country if the king comes from a good family . [ c ] And it is very good for a country if the rulers control their eating and drinking . They eat and drink to become strong , not to become drunk .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	18	If someone is too lazy to work , their house will begin to leak , and the roof will fall in .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	19	People enjoy eating , and wine makes life happier . But money solves a lot of problems . Gossip
ERV	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Don ’ t say bad things about the king . Don ’ t even think bad things about him . And don ’ t say bad things about rich people , even if you are alone in your home . A little bird might fly and tell them everything you said . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 10:4 If you … great mistakes Literally , “ A healer can put to rest great sins. ” The word “ healer ” means a person who is forgiving and tries to help other people . - Ecclesiastes 10:5 in this life Literally , “ under the sun. ” - Ecclesiastes 10:17 comes from a good family Literally , “ is a son of freedmen. ” This is a person who was never a slave and whose parents were not slaves .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	11	Do good wherever you go . [ a ] After a while , the good you do will come back to you .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Invest what you have in several different things . [ b ] You don ’ t know what bad things might happen on earth .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	3	There are some things you can be sure of . If clouds are full of rain , they will pour water on the earth . If a tree falls—to the south or to the north—then it will stay where it falls .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	4	But there are some things that you can not be sure of . You must take a chance . If you wait for perfect weather , you will never plant your seeds . If you are afraid that every cloud will bring rain , you will never harvest your crops .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	5	You don ’ t know where the wind blows . And you don ’ t know how a baby grows in its mother ’ s womb . In the same way , you don ’ t know what God will do—and he makes everything happen .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	6	So begin planting early in the morning , and don ’ t stop working until evening . You don ’ t know what might make you rich . Maybe everything you do will be successful .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	7	It is good to be alive . It is nice to see the light from the sun .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	8	You should enjoy every day of your life , no matter how long you live . But remember that you will die , and you will be dead much longer than you were alive . And after you are dead , you can not do anything . Serve God While You Are Young
ERV	Ecclesiastes	11	9	So young people , enjoy yourselves while you are young . Be happy . Do whatever your heart leads you to do . Do whatever you want , but remember that God will judge you for everything you do .

Protect yourself from troubles . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	12	So , son , study these sayings , but be careful about other teachings . People are always writing books , and too much study will make you very tired . 13-14 Now , what should we learn from everything that is written in this book ? [ e ] The most important thing a person can do is to respect God and obey his commands , because he knows about everything people do—even the secret things . He knows about all the good and all the bad , and he will judge people for everything they do . Footnotes - Ecclesiastes 12:1 I have wasted my life Literally , “ I take no pleasure in them. ” This might mean “ I don ’ t like the things I did when I was young ” or “ I don ’ t enjoy life now that I am old. ” - Ecclesiastes 12:5 desire Or “ appetite ” or “ sexual desire. ” The Hebrew text here is hard to understand . - Ecclesiastes 12:8 meaningless … a waste of time The Hebrew word means “ vapor , ” “ breath , ” or “ something that is useless , meaningless , empty , wrong , or a waste of time. ” - Ecclesiastes 12:9 arranged This Hebrew word means “ to make straight , ” “ arrange , ” “ correct , ” or “ edit. ” - Ecclesiastes 12:13 Now … book Literally , “ The sum of the matter , when all is heard , is … . ”
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	2	Remember your Creator while you are young , before the time comes when the sun and the moon and the stars become dark to you—before problems come again and again like one storm after another .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	3	At that time your arms will lose their strength . Your legs will become weak and bent . Your teeth will fall out , and you will not be able to chew your food . Your eyes will not see clearly .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	4	You will become hard of hearing . You will not hear the noise in the streets . Even the stone grinding your grain will seem quiet to you . You will not be able to hear the women singing . But even the sound of a bird singing will wake you early in the morning because you will not be able to sleep .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	5	You will be afraid of high places . You will be afraid of tripping over every small thing in your path . Your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree . You will drag yourself along like a grasshopper when you walk . You will lose your desire , [ b ] and then you will go to your eternal home . The mourners will gather in the streets as they carry your body to the grave . Death
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	6	Remember your Creator while you are young , before the silver rope snaps and the golden bowl is crushed like a jar broken at the well , like a stone cover on a well that breaks and falls in .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	7	Your body came from the earth . And when you die , it will return to the earth . But your spirit came from God , and when you die , it will return to him .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	8	Everything is so meaningless . The Teacher says that it is all a waste of time ! [ c ] Final Words of Advice
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	9	The Teacher was very wise . He used his wisdom to teach the people . He very carefully studied and arranged [ d ] many wise teachings .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	10	The Teacher tried very hard to find the right words , and he wrote the teachings that are true and dependable .
ERV	Ecclesiastes	12	11	Words from the wise are like sharp goads . When these sayings are written down and saved , they can be used to guide people , just as a shepherd uses a sharp stick to make his sheep go the right way .

ERV	Isaiah	27	7	Israel was not hurt as badly as the enemy who tried to hurt it . Not as many of its people were killed as those who tried to kill them .
ERV	Isaiah	27	8	The Lord will settle his argument with Israel by sending the people far away . He will speak harshly to Israel . His words will burn like the hot desert wind .
ERV	Isaiah	27	9	How will Jacob ’ s guilt be forgiven ? What will happen so his sins can be taken away ? The rocks of the altar will be crushed to dust ; the statues [ d ] and altars for worshiping false gods will all be destroyed .

ERV	Isaiah	28	28	People grind grain to make flour , but they don ’ t grind it forever . As God does in punishing people , a worker might drive his wagon over the grain to remove the hulls , but he does not allow the horses [ g ] to crush it .

ERV	Isaiah	28	4	That city sits on a hill with a rich valley around it . But that beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant . It will be like the first figs of summer . As soon as someone sees a ripe one , they pick it and eat it .
ERV	Isaiah	28	5	At that time the Lord All-Powerful will become the “ Beautiful Crown. ” He will be the “ Wonderful Crown of Flowers ” for his people who are left .
ERV	Isaiah	28	6	Then he will give wisdom to the judges who rule his people . He will give strength to the people who are in battles at the city gates .

ERV	Isaiah	28	11	So God will use this strange way of talking , and he will use other languages to speak to these people .
ERV	Isaiah	28	12	In the past he spoke to them and said , “ Here is a resting place . Let those who are tired come and rest . This is the place of peace. ” But they would not listen to him .

ERV	Isaiah	28	17	“ Workers use a string and weight to show their work is straight and true . I will use justice as the string and goodness as the weight when I lay that foundation . But your safe places were built on lies . So they will be destroyed and washed away when the troubles come against you like hail storms and floods .
ERV	Isaiah	28	18	Your agreement with death will be erased . Your contract with Sheol will not help you . “ Someone will come and punish you . He will make you like the dirt he walks on .

ERV	Isaiah	28	23	Listen closely to the message I am telling you .
ERV	Isaiah	28	24	Does a farmer plow his field all the time ? No , he doesn ’ t work the soil all the time .
ERV	Isaiah	28	25	A farmer prepares the ground , and then he plants the seed . He plants different kinds of seeds different ways . He scatters dill seeds , he throws cumin seeds on the ground , and he plants wheat in rows . A farmer plants barley in its special place , and he plants spelt seeds at the edge of his field .
ERV	Isaiah	28	26	Our God is using this to teach you a lesson . This example shows us that God is fair when he punishes his people .
ERV	Isaiah	28	27	Does a farmer use large boards with sharp teeth to crush dill seeds ? No , and he doesn ’ t use a wagon to crush cumin seeds . A farmer uses a small stick to break the hulls from these seeds of grain .

ERV	Isaiah	29	12	Or you can give the book to someone who can not read and tell that person to read it . That person will say , “ I can not read the book because I don ’ t know how to read. ”
ERV	Isaiah	29	13	The Lord says , “ These people come to honor me with words , but I am not really important to them . The worship they give me is nothing but human rules they have memorized .
ERV	Isaiah	29	14	So I will continue to amaze them by doing powerful and amazing things . Their wise men will lose their wisdom . Even the most intelligent among them will not be able to understand. ”
ERV	Isaiah	29	15	Look at them ! They try to hide things from the Lord . They think he will not understand . They do their evil things in darkness . They tell themselves : “ No one can see us . No one will know who we are. ”
ERV	Isaiah	29	16	You turn things upside down . You think the clay is equal to the potter . You think that something that is made can tell the one who made it , “ You did not make me ! ” This is like a pot telling its maker , “ You know nothing. ” A Better Time Is Coming

ERV	Isaiah	30	26	At that time the light from the moon will be as bright as the sun , and the light from the sun will be seven times brighter than it is now .

ERV	Isaiah	36	36	During Hezekiah ’ s 14th year as king , Sennacherib king of Assyria went to fight against all the strong cities of Judah . Sennacherib defeated those cities .
ERV	Isaiah	36	2	He sent his commander with a large army to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem . The commander and his army left Lachish and went to Jerusalem . They stopped near the aqueduct [ a ] by the Upper Pool , [ b ] on the street that leads up to Laundryman ’ s Field .
ERV	Isaiah	36	3	Three men from Jerusalem went out to talk with the commander . These men were Eliakim son of Hilkiah , Joah son of Asaph , and Shebna . Eliakim was the palace manager , Joah was the record keeper , and Shebna was the royal secretary .
ERV	Isaiah	36	4	The commander told them , “ Tell Hezekiah this is what the great king , the king of Assyria says : “ ‘ What are you trusting in to help you ?
ERV	Isaiah	36	5	I tell you , if you are trusting in power and great battle plans , that is useless . Those are nothing but empty words . Now I ask you , who do you trust so much that you are willing to rebel against me ?
ERV	Isaiah	36	6	Are you depending on Egypt to help you ? Egypt is like a broken walking stick . If you lean on it for support , it will only stab you and hurt you . Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , can not be trusted by anyone who depends on him for help .
ERV	Isaiah	36	7	“ ‘ So maybe you will say , “ We trust the Lord our God to help us. ” But Hezekiah destroyed the altars and high places where people worshiped your God , right ? Hezekiah told the people of Judah and Jerusalem , “ You must worship only at this one altar here in Jerusalem. ”
ERV	Isaiah	36	8	“ ‘ If you still want to fight , my master , the king of Assyria , will make this agreement with you . I promise that I will give you
ERV	Isaiah	36	2000	horses if you can find enough men to ride them into battle .
ERV	Isaiah	36	9	But even then , you couldn ’ t beat even one of my master ’ s lowest ranking officers . So why do you still depend on Egypt ’ s chariots and horse soldiers ?
ERV	Isaiah	36	10	“ ‘ Now , do you think I came to this country to destroy it without the Lord ’ s help . No , it was the Lord who said to me , “ Go up against this country and destroy it ! ” ’ ”
ERV	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna , and Joah said to the commander , “ Please , speak to us in Hebrew . [ c ] We understand that language . Don ’ t speak to us in the language of Judah . If you use our language , the people on the city walls will understand you. ”
ERV	Isaiah	36	12	But the commander said , “ My master sent me to speak to everyone , not just to you and your master . I must also speak to those people sitting there on the wall . When we surround your city , they will suffer too . Like you , they will become so hungry they will eat their own waste and drink their own urine ! ”
ERV	Isaiah	36	13	Then the commander , shouting loudly in Hebrew , [ d ] gave this warning to them all : Hear this message from the great king , the king of Assyria !
ERV	Isaiah	36	14	This is what the king says : Don ’ t let Hezekiah fool you ! He can not save you from my power .
ERV	Isaiah	36	15	Don ’ t listen to him when he tells you to trust in the Lord . Don ’ t believe him when he says , “ The Lord will save us . He will not let the king of Assyria defeat the city. ”
ERV	Isaiah	36	16	Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah ! This is what the king of Assyria says : Come out here and show me that you want peace . Then you will all be free to have grapes from your own vines , figs from your own trees , and water from your own well .
ERV	Isaiah	36	17	After some time , I will come and take you to a land like your own . In that new land , you will have plenty of grain for making bread and vineyards for producing wine .
ERV	Isaiah	36	18	Don ’ t believe Hezekiah when he tells you , “ The Lord will save us. ” He is wrong . Did any of the gods of other nations save their land from the king of Assyria ?
ERV	Isaiah	36	19	When I destroyed the cities of Hamath and Arpad , where were their gods ? What about the gods of Sepharvaim ? Were any gods able to save Samaria from my power ?
ERV	Isaiah	36	20	None of the gods of these other places were able to save their land from me ! So why do you think the Lord can save Jerusalem from me ?
ERV	Isaiah	36	21	But the people were silent . They did not say a word to the commander , because King Hezekiah had commanded them , “ Don ’ t say anything to him. ”
ERV	Isaiah	36	22	Then the palace manager ( Eliakim son of Hilkiah ) , the royal secretary ( Shebna ) , and the record keeper ( Joah son of Asaph ) went to Hezekiah . Their clothes were torn to show they were upset . They told Hezekiah everything the Assyrian commander had said . Footnotes - Isaiah 36:2 aqueduct A ditch or pipe that carries water from one place to another . Here , this is the Shiloah , a channel that carried water from Gihon Spring to the Old Pool and the Pool of Siloam . - Isaiah 36:2 Upper Pool The Pool of Siloam at the southern tip of the City of David ( Jerusalem ) , just above the older pool now called Birket al Hamrah . - Isaiah 36:11 Hebrew Literally , “ Judean , ” the language of Judah and Israel . - Isaiah 36:13 Hebrew Literally , “ Judean , ” the language of Judah and Israel .
ERV	Isaiah	37	37	So King Sennacherib of Assyria went back to Nineveh and stayed there .
ERV	Isaiah	37	2	Kings 19:20 . - Isaiah 37:22 The virgin daughter Zion The city of Jerusalem , which is in danger of attack by the Assyrians . See “ Zion ” in the Word List . - Isaiah 37:32 strong love The Hebrew word can mean strong feelings such as zeal , jealousy , or love .
ERV	Isaiah	37	3	They said to Isaiah , “ King Hezekiah has commanded that today will be a special day for sorrow and sadness . It will be a very sad day—as sad as when a baby should be born , but there is not enough strength for the birth .
ERV	Isaiah	37	4	The commander ’ s master , the king of Assyria , has sent him to say bad things about the living God . Maybe the Lord your God will hear it and prove the enemy is wrong . So pray for those who are still left alive. ”
ERV	Isaiah	37	5	When King Hezekiah ’ s officers came to Isaiah ,
ERV	Isaiah	37	6	he said to them , “ Give this message to your master , Hezekiah : The Lord says , ‘ Don ’ t be afraid of what you heard from the commanders ! Don ’ t believe what those “ boys ” from the king of Assyria said to make fun of me .
ERV	Isaiah	37	7	Look , I will send a spirit against the king of Assyria . He will get a report that will make him return to his own country . And I will cut him down with a sword in his own country. ’ ” The Assyrian Army Leaves Jerusalem
ERV	Isaiah	37	8	The commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish . He found him at Libnah , fighting against that city .
ERV	Isaiah	37	9	Then the king of Assyria got a report that said , “ King Tirhakah [ a ] of Ethiopia is coming to fight you. ” So the king of Assyria sent messengers to Hezekiah again .
ERV	Isaiah	37	10	He told them , “ Tell King Hezekiah of Judah these things : ‘ Don ’ t be fooled by the god you trust when he says , “ Jerusalem will not be defeated by the king of Assyria. ”
ERV	Isaiah	37	11	You have heard what the kings of Assyria did to all the other countries . We destroyed them completely . Will you be saved ? No !
ERV	Isaiah	37	12	Did the gods of those people save them ? No , my ancestors destroyed them all . They destroyed the cities of Gozan , Haran , Rezeph , and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar .
ERV	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamath ? The king of Arpad ? The king of the city of Sepharvaim ? The kings of Hena and Ivvah ? ’ ” Hezekiah Prays to the Lord
ERV	Isaiah	37	14	Hezekiah received the letters from the messengers and read them . Then he went up to the Lord ’ s Temple and laid the letters out in front of the Lord .
ERV	Isaiah	37	15	He prayed to the Lord :
ERV	Isaiah	37	16	“ Lord All-Powerful , God of Israel , you sit as King above the Cherub angels . You alone are the God who rules all the kingdoms on earth . You made heaven and earth .
ERV	Isaiah	37	17	Lord , please pay attention and hear this . Open your eyes , Lord , and see what is happening . Listen to all the insults against the living God in the message Sennacherib sent !
ERV	Isaiah	37	18	It is true , Lord . The kings of Assyria did destroy all those nations .
ERV	Isaiah	37	19	They did throw the gods of those nations into the fire , but they were not real gods . They were only wood and stone—statues that people made . That is why the kings of Assyria could destroy them .
ERV	Isaiah	37	20	But you are the Lord our God , so please save us from the king of Assyria . Then all the other nations will know that you are the Lord , the only God. ” God Answers Hezekiah
ERV	Isaiah	37	21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah : “ The Lord , the God of Israel , says , ‘ You prayed to me about the message that came from King Sennacherib of Assyria . I have heard you . [ b ] ’
ERV	Isaiah	37	22	“ So this is the Lord ’ s message against Sennacherib : ‘ The virgin daughter Zion [ c ] does not think you are important . She makes fun of you . Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head at you and laughs behind your back .
ERV	Isaiah	37	23	But who was it that you insulted and made fun of ? Who was it that you spoke against ? You were speaking against the Holy One of Israel . You acted like you were great and he was nothing .
ERV	Isaiah	37	24	You sent your officers to insult the Lord . This is what you said : “ I took my many chariots up the high mountains deep inside Lebanon . I cut down its tallest cedars and its best fir trees . I have been on its highest mountain and deep inside its forests .
ERV	Isaiah	37	25	I dug wells and drank water from new places . I dried up the rivers of Egypt and walked where the water was. ”
ERV	Isaiah	37	26	‘ How could you say this , Sennacherib ? Did no one ever tell you that I , the Lord , planned these things long ago ? From ancient times I decided what would happen . And now I have made it happen . I let you tear down strong cities and change them into piles of rocks .
ERV	Isaiah	37	27	The people living there had no power . They were afraid and confused . They were about to be cut down like grass and plants in the field . They were like grass growing on the housetops , dying before it grows tall .
ERV	Isaiah	37	28	I know all about your battles ; I know when you rested , when you went out to war , and when you came home . I also know when you got upset at me .
ERV	Isaiah	37	29	Yes , you were upset at me . I heard your proud insults . So I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth . Then I will turn you around and lead you back the way you came. ’ ” The Lord ’ s Message for Hezekiah
ERV	Isaiah	37	30	Then the Lord said , “ I will give you a sign to show you that these words are true . You will not be able to plant seeds this year , so next year you will eat grain that grew wild from the previous year ’ s crop . But in the third year , you will eat grain from seeds that you planted . You will harvest your crops , and you will have plenty to eat . You will plant vineyards and eat grapes from them .
ERV	Isaiah	37	31	“ The people from the family of Judah who have escaped and are left alive will be like plants that send their roots deep into the ground and produce fruit above the ground .
ERV	Isaiah	37	32	That is because a few people will come out of Jerusalem alive . There will be survivors coming from Mount Zion. ” The strong love [ d ] of the Lord All-Powerful will do this .
ERV	Isaiah	37	33	So the Lord says this about the king of Assyria : “ He will not come into this city or shoot an arrow here . He will not bring his shields up against this city or build up a hill of dirt to attack its walls .
ERV	Isaiah	37	34	He will go back the way he came . He will not come into this city . The Lord says this !
ERV	Isaiah	37	35	I will protect this city and save it . I will do this for myself and for my servant David. ” The Assyrian Army Is Destroyed
ERV	Isaiah	37	36	That night the angel of the Lord went out and killed 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp . When the people got up in the morning , they saw all the dead bodies .
ERV	Isaiah	37	38	One day Sennacherib was in the temple of his god Nisroch , worshiping him . His sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword and ran away to Ararat . So Sennacherib ’ s son Esarhaddon became the new king of Assyria . Footnotes - Isaiah 37:9 Tirhakah This is probably Taharqa , the Pharaoh of Egypt about 690–664 B.C . - Isaiah 37:21 I have heard you This is from the ancient Greek version and
ERV	Isaiah	38	38	At that time Hezekiah became sick and almost died . The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him , “ The Lord told me to tell you this : ‘ You will die soon . So you should tell your family what they should do when you die . You will not get well. ’ ”
ERV	Isaiah	38	2	Kings 20:6-9 . - Isaiah 38:8 steps of Ahaz The steps of a special building that Hezekiah used like a clock . When the sun shone on the steps , the shadows showed what time of the day it was . - Isaiah 38:11 the Lord Yah Or “ Yahweh , ” a Hebrew name for God . See “ Yahweh ” in the Word List .
ERV	Isaiah	38	3	“ Lord , remember that I have faithfully served you with all my heart . I have done what you say is good. ” Then Hezekiah cried very hard .
ERV	Isaiah	38	4	Then Isaiah received this message from the Lord :
ERV	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go to Hezekiah and tell him that the Lord , the God of your ancestor David , says , ‘ I heard your prayer , and I saw your tears . I will add
ERV	Isaiah	38	15	What can I say ? He told me what would happen , and he will make it happen . I have had these troubles in my soul , so now I will be humble all my life .
ERV	Isaiah	38	6	I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria . I will protect this city. ’ ”
ERV	Isaiah	38	21	[ a ] Then Isaiah told Hezekiah , “ Crush figs together and put them on your sore . Then you will get well. ”
ERV	Isaiah	38	22	Hezekiah asked Isaiah , “ What is the sign that proves I will get well and go to the Lord ’ s Temple ? ”
ERV	Isaiah	38	7	This is the sign from the Lord to show you that he will do what he says :
ERV	Isaiah	38	8	“ Look , I am causing the shadow that is on the steps of Ahaz [ b ] to move back ten steps . The sun ’ s shadow will go back up the ten steps that it has already been on. ” Hezekiah ’ s Song
ERV	Isaiah	38	9	This is the letter from Hezekiah when he became well :
ERV	Isaiah	38	10	I thought I would live a full life . But now , in the middle of my life , the time has come for me to die .
ERV	Isaiah	38	11	So I said , “ I will not see the Lord Yah [ c ] in the land of the living again . I will not see the people living on earth .
ERV	Isaiah	38	12	My home , my shepherd ’ s tent , is being pulled down and taken from me . I am finished like the cloth someone rolls up and cuts from the loom . You ended my life in such a short time .
ERV	Isaiah	38	13	All night I cried as loud as a lion , but my hopes were crushed like a lion eating bones . You finished my life in such a short time .
ERV	Isaiah	38	14	I cried like a bird and moaned like a dove . My eyes became tired , but I continued looking to the heavens . Lord , I am so depressed . Promise to help me. ”
ERV	Isaiah	38	16	Lord , use this hard time to make my spirit live again . Help my spirit become strong and healthy . Help me become well ! Help me live again !
ERV	Isaiah	38	17	Look , my troubles are gone ! I now have peace . You love me very much . You did not let me rot in the grave . You took my sins and threw them away .
ERV	Isaiah	38	18	The dead can not praise you . People in Sheol can not sing praises to you . Those who have died and gone below are not trusting in your faithfulness .
ERV	Isaiah	38	19	People who are alive , people like me , are the ones who will praise you . Fathers should tell their children about how faithful you are .
ERV	Isaiah	38	20	So I say , “ The Lord saved me . So we will sing and play songs in the Lord ’ s Temple all our lives. ” Footnotes - Isaiah 38:21 These verses fit better here than at the end of the chapter , where they appear in the standard Hebrew text . See
ERV	Isaiah	39	39	At that time Merodach Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon . He sent some men with letters and a gift to Hezekiah when he heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
ERV	Isaiah	39	2	This made Hezekiah very happy , so he showed them all the valuable things in his storehouses . He showed them the silver , the gold , the spices , and the expensive perfumes . He showed them the building where he stored the weapons . He showed them everything in his treasuries and everything in his house and throughout his kingdom .
ERV	Isaiah	39	3	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him , “ What did these men say ? Where did they come from ? ” Hezekiah said , “ These men came all the way from Babylon just to see me. ”
ERV	Isaiah	39	4	So Isaiah asked him , “ What did they see in your house ? ” Hezekiah said , “ They saw everything in my palace . I showed them all my wealth. ”
ERV	Isaiah	39	5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to this message from the Lord All-Powerful :
ERV	Isaiah	39	6	‘ The time is coming when everything in your house and everything your ancestors have saved until today will be carried away to Babylon . Nothing will be left ! ’ The Lord All-Powerful said this .
ERV	Isaiah	39	7	The Babylonians will take your own sons , and your sons will become officers [ a ] in the palace of the king of Babylon. ”
ERV	Isaiah	39	8	Then Hezekiah told Isaiah , “ This message from the Lord is good. ” ( Hezekiah said this because he thought , “ There will be real peace and security during my lifetime. ” ) Footnotes - Isaiah 39:7 officers Or “ eunuchs. ” See “ eunuch ” in the Word List .

ERV	Isaiah	40	3	Listen , there is someone shouting : “ Prepare a way in the desert for the Lord . Make a straight road there for our God .
ERV	Isaiah	40	4	Every valley must be filled . Every mountain and hill should be made flat . The crooked roads should be made straight , and the rough ground made smooth .
ERV	Isaiah	40	5	Then the Glory of the Lord will be shown to everyone . Together , all people will see it . Yes , this is what the Lord himself said ! ”
ERV	Isaiah	40	6	A voice said , “ Speak ! ” So the man said , “ What should I say ? ” The voice said , “ People are like grass . Any glory they enjoy is like a wildflower .
ERV	Isaiah	40	7	When a wind from the Lord blows on them , the grass dies and the flower falls . Yes , all people are like grass .
ERV	Isaiah	40	8	Grass dies and flowers fall , but the word of our God lasts forever. ” Salvation : God ’ s Good News
ERV	Isaiah	40	9	Zion , you have good news to tell . Go up on a high mountain and shout the good news . Jerusalem , you have good news to tell . Don ’ t be afraid ; speak loudly . Tell this news to all the cities of Judah : “ Look , here is your God ! ”
ERV	Isaiah	40	10	The Lord God is coming with power . He will use his power to rule all the people . He will bring rewards for his people . He will have their payment with him .

ERV	Isaiah	40	12	Who measured the oceans in the palm of his hand ? Who used his hand to measure the sky ? Who used a bowl to measure all the dust of the earth ? Who used scales to measure the mountains and hills ?
ERV	Isaiah	40	13	Who could know the Lord ’ s mind ? Who could be his teacher or give him advice ?
ERV	Isaiah	40	14	Did the Lord ask for anyone ’ s help ? Did anyone teach him to be fair ? Did anyone teach him knowledge ? Did anyone teach him to be wise ?

ERV	Isaiah	40	18	Can you compare God to anything ? Can you make a picture of God ?
ERV	Isaiah	40	19	No , but some people make statues from rock or wood , and they call them gods . One worker makes a statue . Then another worker covers it with gold and makes silver chains for it .
ERV	Isaiah	40	20	For the base he chooses special wood , a kind of wood that will not rot . Then he finds a good wood worker , and the worker makes a “ god ” that will not fall over .

ERV	Isaiah	40	26	Look up to the skies . Who created all those stars ? Who created all those “ armies ” in the sky ? Who knows every star by name ? He is very strong and powerful , so not one of these stars is lost .
ERV	Isaiah	40	27	People of Jacob , this is true . Israel , you should believe it . So why do you say , “ The Lord can not see the way I live ; he will not find me and punish me ” [ a ] ?
ERV	Isaiah	40	28	Surely you know the truth . Surely you have heard . The Lord is the God who lives forever ! He created all the faraway places on earth . He does not get tired and weary . You can not learn all he knows .
ERV	Isaiah	40	29	He helps tired people be strong . He gives power to those without it .
ERV	Isaiah	40	30	Young men get tired and need to rest . Even young boys stumble and fall .
ERV	Isaiah	40	31	But those who trust in the Lord will become strong again . They will be like eagles that grow new feathers . [ b ] They will run and not get weak . They will walk and not get tired .

ERV	Isaiah	41	6	“ Workers help each other . They encourage each other to be strong .
ERV	Isaiah	41	7	One worker cuts wood to make a statue . He encourages the man who works with gold . Another worker uses a hammer and makes the metal smooth . Then he encourages the man at the anvil .

ERV	Isaiah	41	25	“ I called someone in the north [ f ] to come . He is coming from the east where the sun rises , and he honors my name . He tramples kings the way a potter softens clay with his feet .

ERV	Isaiah	43	24	So you did not use your money to buy things to honor me . But you did force me to be like your slave . You sinned until the bad things you did made me very tired .
ERV	Isaiah	43	25	“ I , I am the one who wipes away all your sins . I do this to please myself . I will not remember your sins .

ERV	Isaiah	44	12	One worker uses his tools to heat iron over hot coals . Then he uses his hammer to beat the metal to shape it into a statue . He uses his own powerful arms , but when he gets hungry , he loses his strength . If he does not drink water , he becomes weak .
ERV	Isaiah	44	13	Another worker uses his string line [ d ] and compass [ e ] to draw lines on the wood to show where he should cut . Then he uses his chisels [ f ] and cuts a statue from the wood . He uses his calipers [ g ] to measure the statue . In this way the worker makes the wood look exactly like a man , and this statue of a man does nothing but sit in the house .

ERV	Isaiah	44	17	There is a little of the wood left , so he makes a statue and calls it his god . He bows down before it and worships it . He prays to it and says , “ You are my god , save me ! ”
ERV	Isaiah	44	18	People like that don ’ t know what they are doing ! They don ’ t understand . It is as if they have mud in their eyes so they can not see . Their minds can not understand .
ERV	Isaiah	44	19	They don ’ t realize what they are doing . They aren ’ t smart enough to think , “ I burned half of the wood in the fire . I used the hot coals to bake my bread and cook the meat I ate . And I used the wood that was left to make this terrible thing . I am worshiping a block of wood ! ”

ERV	Isaiah	49	3	He told me , “ Israel , you are my servant . I will do wonderful things with you. ”
ERV	Isaiah	49	4	I said , “ I worked hard for nothing . I wore myself out , but I did nothing useful . I used all my power , but I did not really do anything . So the Lord must decide what to do with me . He must decide my reward. ”

ERV	Isaiah	50	2	I came home and found no one there . I called and called , but no one answered . Do you think I can not get you back ? Do you think I can not save you ?

ERV	Isaiah	51	19	Troubles came to you , Jerusalem , in pairs : Your land was destroyed and lies in ruins , and your people suffered from famine and war . But no one felt sorry for you or showed you mercy .
ERV	Isaiah	51	20	Your people became weak . They fell on the ground and lay there . They were lying on every street corner , like animals caught in a net .

ERV	Isaiah	53	5	But he was being punished for what we did . He was crushed because of our guilt . He took the punishment we deserved , and this brought us peace . We were healed because of his pain .

ERV	Isaiah	65	2	“ All day long I stood ready to accept those who turned against me . But they kept doing whatever they wanted to do , and all they did was wrong .
ERV	Isaiah	65	3	They keep doing things , right in front of me , that make me angry . They offer sacrifices and burn incense in their special gardens . [ b ]
ERV	Isaiah	65	4	They sit among the graves , waiting to get messages from the dead . They eat the meat of pigs , and their pots are full of soup made from unclean meat .
ERV	Isaiah	65	5	But they tell others , ‘ Don ’ t come near me ! Don ’ t touch me because I am holy ! ’ They are like smoke in my eyes , and their fire burns all the time. ” Israel Must Be Punished
ERV	Isaiah	65	6	“ Look , here is a letter that lists all your sins . I will not be quiet until I pay you back for these sins . I will do it by punishing you .
ERV	Isaiah	65	7	I , the Lord , am doing this because of your sins and the sins of your ancestors . They did these sins when they burned incense in the mountains . They shamed me on those hills , and I punished them first. ”
ERV	Isaiah	65	8	The Lord says , “ When there is new wine in the grapes , people squeeze out the wine . But they don ’ t completely destroy the grapes because the grapes can still be used . I will do the same thing to my servants . I will not destroy them completely .
ERV	Isaiah	65	9	I will keep some of the people of Jacob . Some of the people of Judah will get my mountains . I will choose the people who will get the land . My servants will live there .
ERV	Isaiah	65	10	Then Sharon Valley will be a field for sheep . The Valley of Achor [ c ] will be a place for cattle to rest . All this will be for my people—for the people who come to me for help .
ERV	Isaiah	65	11	“ But you people left the Lord , so you will be punished . You forgot about my holy mountain . [ d ] You began to worship Luck . You held feasts for the false god , Fate . [ e ]
ERV	Isaiah	65	12	But I decided what would happen to you : you will be killed with a sword . You will all be killed because I called to you , but you refused to answer me . I spoke to you , but you would not listen . You did what I said is evil and chose to do what I did not like. ”
ERV	Isaiah	65	13	So this is what the Lord God says : “ My servants will eat , but you evil people will be hungry . My servants will drink , but you will be thirsty . My servants will be happy , but you will suffer shame .
ERV	Isaiah	65	14	My servants will shout for joy , but you will cry out in pain . [ f ] Your spirits will be broken , and you will be very sad .
ERV	Isaiah	65	15	Your names will be like curses to my chosen servants. ” The Lord God will kill you , and then he will call his servants by a new name .
ERV	Isaiah	65	16	The Lord says , “ People now ask blessings from the earth . But in the future they will ask blessings from the faithful God . People now trust in the power of the earth when they make a promise . But in the future they will trust in the God who is faithful . That ’ s because the troubles in the past will all be forgotten . They will be hidden from my sight. ” A New Time Is Coming
ERV	Isaiah	65	17	“ I am creating a new heaven and a new earth . The troubles of the past will be forgotten . No one will remember them .
ERV	Isaiah	65	18	My people will be happy and rejoice forever and ever because of what I will make . I will make a Jerusalem that is full of joy , and I will make her people happy .
ERV	Isaiah	65	19	“ Then I will rejoice with Jerusalem . I will be happy with my people . There will never again be crying and sadness in that city .
ERV	Isaiah	65	20	In that city there will never be a baby who lives only a few days , and every older person will live for a long , long time . A person who lives
ERV	Isaiah	65	100	years will be called young . And whoever doesn ’ t live that long will be considered cursed .
ERV	Isaiah	65	21	“ In that city whoever builds a house will live there ; whoever plants a vineyard will eat the grapes from that garden .
ERV	Isaiah	65	22	Never again will one person build a house and another person live there . Never again will one person plant a garden and another eat the fruit from it . My people will live as long as the trees . My chosen people will get full use of whatever they make .
ERV	Isaiah	65	23	Never again will a woman suffer childbirth and have her baby die . Women will not fear childbirth . I , the Lord , will bless all my people and their children .
ERV	Isaiah	65	24	I will answer them before they call for help . I will help them before they finish asking .
ERV	Isaiah	65	25	Wolves and little lambs will eat together . Lions will eat hay like cattle , and snakes will eat only dust . They will not hurt or destroy each other on my holy mountain. ” This is what the Lord said . Footnotes - Isaiah 65:1 I helped … me Or “ I was ready to answer those who did not come to me for advice .

ERV	Isaiah	66	2	I am the one who made all things . They are all here because I made them , ” says the Lord . “ These are the people I care for : the poor , humble people who obey my commands .
ERV	Isaiah	66	3	Some people kill bulls as a sacrifice , but they also beat people . They kill sheep as a sacrifice , but they also break the necks of dogs . They offer up grain offerings , but they also offer the blood of pigs . [ a ] They burn incense , but they also love their worthless idols . They choose their own ways , and they love their terrible idols .
ERV	Isaiah	66	4	So I decided to use their own tricks . I will punish them using what they are most afraid of . I will do this because I called to them , but they did not answer . I spoke to them , but they did not listen . They did what I said is evil . They chose to do what I did not like. ”
ERV	Isaiah	66	5	You who obey the Lord ’ s commands , listen to what he says : “ Your brothers hated you . They turned against you because you followed me . Your brothers said , ‘ When the Lord shows his glory , then we will rejoice with you. ’ But they will be punished. ” Punishment and a New Nation
ERV	Isaiah	66	6	Listen ! There is a loud noise coming from the city and from the Temple . It is the Lord punishing his enemies . He is giving them the punishment they deserve . 7-8 “ A woman does not give birth before she feels the pain . A woman must feel the pain of childbirth before she can see the boy she gives birth to . Who ever heard of such a thing ? In the same way , no one ever saw a new world begin in one day . No one has ever heard of a new nation that began in one day . But when Zion feels the pain , she will give birth to her children .
ERV	Isaiah	66	9	In the same way , I will not cause pain without allowing something new to be born. ” The Lord says this : “ I promise that if I cause you the pain of birth , I will not stop you from having your new nation. ” Your God said this .

ERV	Isaiah	66	12	This is what the Lord says : “ Look , I will give Jerusalem peace that will flow in like a river . Wealth from all the nations will come flowing into her like a flood . And like little babies , you will drink that ‘ milk. ’ I will hold you in my arms , and bounce you on my knees .
ERV	Isaiah	66	13	I will comfort you like a mother comforting her child . You will be comforted in Jerusalem. ”
ERV	Isaiah	66	14	When you see these things , you will be happy . You will be free and grow like grass . The Lord ’ s servants will see his power , but his enemies will see his anger .
ERV	Isaiah	66	15	Look , the Lord is coming with fire . His armies are coming with clouds of dust . He is angry , and he will punish his enemies with flames .
ERV	Isaiah	66	16	The Lord will judge the people and will punish them with fire and his sword . There will be many people killed by the Lord .
ERV	Isaiah	66	17	The Lord says , “ These are the people who wash themselves and make themselves pure so that they can go into their special gardens [ b ] to worship their idols . They follow each other into the gardens to eat meat from pigs , rats , and other dirty things . But they will all be destroyed together .
ERV	Isaiah	66	18	“ They have evil thoughts and do evil things , so I am coming to punish them . I will gather all nations and all people . Everyone will be gathered together to see my Glory . [ c ]
ERV	Isaiah	66	19	I will put a mark on some of the people . I will send some of these saved people to the nations of Tarshish , Libya , [ d ] Lud [ e ] ( the land of archers ) , Tubal , [ f ] Greece , and all the faraway lands . Those people have never heard my teachings . They have never seen my Glory . So the saved people will tell the nations about my glory .
ERV	Isaiah	66	20	And they will bring all your brothers and sisters from those other nations to my holy mountain [ g ] Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord . Your brothers and sisters will ride on horses , mules , camels , and in chariots and wagons . They will be like the gifts that the Israelites bring on clean plates to the Temple of the Lord .
ERV	Isaiah	66	21	I will also choose some of these people to be priests and Levites. ” The Lord himself said this . The New Heavens and the New Earth

ERV	Jeremiah	1	5	“ Before I made you in your mother ’ s womb , I knew you . Before you were born , I chose you for a special work . I chose you to be a prophet to the nations. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	1	6	Then I said , “ But , Lord God , I don ’ t know how to speak . I am only a boy. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	1	7	But the Lord said to me , “ Don ’ t say , ‘ I am only a boy. ’ You must go everywhere I send you and say everything I tell you to say .
ERV	Jeremiah	1	8	Don ’ t be afraid of anyone . I am with you , and I will protect you. ” This message is from the Lord .

ERV	Jeremiah	1	13	The Lord ’ s message came to me again : “ Jeremiah , what do you see ? ” I answered , “ I see a pot of boiling water . That pot is tipping over from the north. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	1	14	The Lord said to me , “ Something terrible will come from the north . It will happen to all the people who live in this country .
ERV	Jeremiah	1	15	In a short time I will call all the people in the northern kingdoms. ” This is what the Lord said . “ The kings of those countries will come and set up their thrones near the gates of Jerusalem . They will attack the city walls of Jerusalem . They will attack all the cities in Judah .

ERV	Jeremiah	1	17	“ As for you , Jeremiah , get ready . Stand up and speak to the people . Tell them everything that I tell you to say . Don ’ t be afraid of the people . If you are afraid of them , I will give you good reason to be afraid of them .
ERV	Jeremiah	1	18	As for me , today I will make you like a strong city , an iron column , a bronze wall . You will be able to stand against everyone in the land , against the kings of the land of Judah , the leaders of Judah , the priests of Judah , and against the people of the land of Judah .

You followed me like a young bride . You followed me through the desert , through a land that had never been used for farmland .

ERV	Jeremiah	2	5	This is what the Lord says : “ Do you think that I was not fair to your ancestors ? Is that why they turned away from me ? Your ancestors worshiped worthless idols , and they became worthless themselves .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	6	Your ancestors did not say , ‘ The Lord brought us out of Egypt . He led us through the desert , through a dry and rocky land . He led us through a dark and dangerous land . No one lives there ; people don ’ t even travel through that land . But the Lord led us through that land . So where is he now ? ’
ERV	Jeremiah	2	7	“ I brought you into a good land , a land filled with many good things . I did this so that you could eat the fruit and crops that grow there . But you only made my land ‘ dirty. ’ I gave that land to you , but you made it a bad place .

ERV	Jeremiah	2	17	This trouble is your own fault . The Lord your God was leading you the right way , [ f ] but you turned away from him .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	18	People of Judah , think about this : How did it help you to go to Egypt and drink from the Nile River ? How did it help you to go to Assyria and drink from the Euphrates River ?
ERV	Jeremiah	2	19	You have done wrong , and that will only bring punishment to you . Trouble will come to you , and it will teach you a lesson . Think about it and understand how bad it is to turn away from the Lord your God . It is wrong not to fear and respect me. ” This message is from Lord God All-Powerful .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	20	“ Judah , long ago you broke free from me , like an ox that breaks its yoke and the ropes that held it . You said to me , ‘ I will not serve you ! ’ On every high hill and under every green tree , you acted like a prostitute . [ g ]

ERV	Jeremiah	2	23	“ Judah , how can you say to me , ‘ I am not guilty because I have not worshiped the Baal idols ’ ? Think about what you did in the valley . Think about what you have done . You are like a fast she-camel that runs from place to place .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	24	You are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert . At mating time , she sniffs the wind . No one can control her when she is in heat . At mating time , every male that wants her will get her . She is easy to find .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	25	Judah , stop chasing after idols ! Stop wanting those other gods . But you say , ‘ It is no use ! I can not stop ! I love those other gods . I can ’ t stop chasing them. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	2	26	“ A thief is ashamed when people catch him stealing . The people of Israel should be ashamed too and so should their kings and leaders , priests and prophets .

ERV	Jeremiah	2	28	But where are the idols you made for yourselves ? Let ’ s see if they come and save you when you are in trouble ! People of Judah , you have as many idols as you have cities !
ERV	Jeremiah	2	29	“ Why do you argue with me ? You have all turned against me. ” This message was from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	30	“ I punished you people of Judah , but it did not help . You did not come back when you were punished . With your swords you killed the prophets who came to you . Like a dangerous lion , you killed the prophets. ”

My people say , ‘ We are free to go our own way . We will not come back to you ! ’ Why do they say these things ?
ERV	Jeremiah	2	32	A young woman does not forget her jewelry . A bride does not forget to wear her wedding dress . But my people have forgotten me too many times to count .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	33	“ Judah , you have become so good at finding lovers . Even the worst women could learn some evil ways from you .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	34	You have blood on your hands ! It is the blood of poor , innocent people . You did not catch them breaking into your house . You killed them for no reason !
ERV	Jeremiah	2	35	But still , you say , ‘ I am innocent . God is not angry with me. ’ So I will also judge you guilty of lying , because you say , ‘ I have done nothing wrong. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	2	36	You go from one place to another looking for help , always changing your mind . But Egypt will also disappoint you , just as Assyria did .
ERV	Jeremiah	2	37	So you will eventually leave Egypt too , and you will hide your face in shame . You trusted these countries , but the Lord rejected them , so they can not help you win .

ERV	Jeremiah	3	4	But didn ’ t you just call me ‘ Father ’ ? Didn ’ t you say , ‘ You have been my friend since I was a child ’ ?
ERV	Jeremiah	3	5	You also said , ‘ God will not always be angry with me . His anger will not continue forever. ’ “ Judah , you say that , but you do as much evil as you can. ” The Two Bad Sisters : Israel and Judah
ERV	Jeremiah	3	6	The Lord spoke to me during the time King Josiah was ruling the nation of Judah . He said , “ Jeremiah , you saw the bad things Israel [ b ] did ! You saw how she was unfaithful to me . She was unfaithful to me with every idol on every hill and under every green tree .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	7	I said to myself , ‘ Israel will come back to me after she has finished doing these evil things. ’ But she did not come back to me . And Israel ’ s unfaithful sister , Judah , saw what she did .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	8	Israel was unfaithful , and she knew why I sent her away . Israel knew that I divorced her because she committed the sin of adultery . But that did not make her unfaithful sister afraid . Judah was not afraid . She also went out and acted like a prostitute .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	9	Judah did not care that she was acting like a prostitute . So she made her country ‘ dirty. ’ She committed the sin of adultery by worshiping idols made out of stone and wood .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	10	Israel ’ s unfaithful sister did not come back to me with her whole heart . She only pretended that she came back to me. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	11	The Lord said to me , “ Israel was not faithful to me , but she had a better excuse than unfaithful Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	12	Jeremiah , look toward the north and speak this message : “ ‘ Come back , you faithless people of Israel. ’ This message is from the Lord . ‘ I will stop frowning at you . I am full of mercy. ’ The Lord says , ‘ I will not be angry with you forever .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	13	But you must recognize your sin . You turned against the Lord your God . That is your sin . You worshiped the idols of other nations . You worshiped them under every green tree . You did not obey me. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	14	The Lord says , “ You people are unfaithful , but come back to me because I am your master . I will take one person from every city and two people from every family and bring you to Zion .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	15	Then I will give you new rulers who will be faithful to me . They will lead you with knowledge and understanding .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	16	In those days there will be many of you in the land. ” This message is from the Lord . “ At that time people will never again say , ‘ I remember the days when we had the Box of the Lord ’ s Agreement. ’ They will not even think about the Holy Box anymore . They will not even remember or miss it . They will never make another Holy Box .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time the city of Jerusalem will be called the ‘ Lord ’ s Throne. ’ All nations will come together in the city of Jerusalem to give honor to the name of the Lord . They will not follow their stubborn , evil hearts anymore .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the family of Judah will join the family of Israel . They will come together from a land in the north to the land I gave to their ancestors. ” 19-20 This message is from the Lord : “ I want to treat you like my own children . I want to give you a pleasant land , a land more beautiful than any other nation . I thought you would call me ‘ Father. ’ I thought you would always follow me . But you have been unfaithful to me , family of Israel ! You have been like an unfaithful wife who leaves her husband .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	21	You can hear crying on the bare hills . The people of Israel are crying and praying for mercy . They became very evil . They forgot the Lord their God .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	22	“ People of Israel , you are unfaithful to me , but come back to me . Come back and I will forgive [ c ] you for being unfaithful . “ Just say , ‘ Yes , we will come back , because you are the Lord our God .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	23	It was foolish to worship idols on the hills . All the loud parties on the mountains were wrong . Surely the salvation of Israel comes from the Lord our God .
ERV	Jeremiah	3	24	That terrible false god Baal has eaten everything our fathers owned . This has happened since we were children . That terrible false god took our fathers ’ sheep and cattle and their sons and daughters .

ERV	Jeremiah	4	2	If you do these things , you will be able to use my name to make a promise . You will be able to say , ‘ As the Lord lives. ’ You will be able to use these words in a truthful , honest , and right way . If you do these things , the nations will be blessed by the Lord . They will brag about what the Lord has done. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	4	3	This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem : “ Your fields have not been plowed . Plow those fields ! Don ’ t plant seeds among the thorns .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	5	“ Give this message to the people of Judah : Tell everyone in the city of Jerusalem : ‘ Blow the trumpet all over the country. ’ Shout out loud and say , ‘ Come together ! Let us all escape to the strong cities for protection. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	4	6	Raise the signal flag toward Zion . Run for your lives ! Don ’ t wait ! Do this because I am bringing disaster from the north . [ b ] I am bringing terrible destruction. ”

ERV	Jeremiah	4	8	The Lord is angry with us , so put on sackcloth and cry out loud !
ERV	Jeremiah	4	9	The Lord says , “ When this happens , the king and his officers will lose their courage . The priests will be filled with fear , and the prophets will be shocked. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I , Jeremiah , said , “ Lord God , you have tricked the people of Judah and Jerusalem . You said to them , ‘ You will have peace. ’ But now the sword is pointing at their throats ! ”
ERV	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time this message will be given to the people of Judah and Jerusalem : “ A hot wind blows from the bare hills . It comes from the desert to my people . It is not like the gentle wind that is used to separate the grain from the chaff .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	12	It is a stronger wind than that , and it comes from me . Now I will announce my judgment against the people of Judah. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	4	13	Look ! The enemy rises up like a cloud . His chariots look like a windstorm . His horses are faster than eagles . It will be very bad for us ! We are ruined !
ERV	Jeremiah	4	14	People of Jerusalem , wash the evil from your hearts . Make your hearts pure so that you can be saved . Don ’ t continue making evil plans .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	15	Listen ! The voice of a messenger from the land of Dan [ c ] is speaking . Someone is bringing bad news from the hill country of Ephraim [ d ] :
ERV	Jeremiah	4	16	“ Report it to this nation . [ e ] Spread the news to the people in Jerusalem . Enemies are coming from a faraway country . They are shouting words of war against the cities of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	17	The enemy has surrounded Jerusalem like men guarding a field . Judah , you turned against me , so the enemy is coming against you. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	18	“ The way you lived and the things you did brought this trouble to you . It is your evil that made your life so hard . Your evil life brought the pain that hurts deep in your heart. ” Jeremiah ’ s Cry
ERV	Jeremiah	4	19	My sadness and worry is making my stomach hurt . I am bent over in pain . I am so afraid . My heart is pounding inside me . I can not keep quiet , because I have heard the trumpet blow . The trumpet is calling the army to war .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	20	Disaster follows disaster . The whole country is destroyed . Suddenly my tents are destroyed . My curtains are torn down !
ERV	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must I see the war flags ? How long must I hear the war trumpets ?
ERV	Jeremiah	4	22	The Lord said , “ My people are foolish . They don ’ t know me . They are stupid children . They don ’ t understand . They are skillful at doing evil , but they don ’ t know how to do good. ” Disaster Is Coming
ERV	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked at the earth . It was empty ; there was nothing on it . I looked at the sky , and its light was gone . [ f ]
ERV	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains , and they were shaking . All the hills were trembling .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked , but there were no people . All the birds of the sky had flown away .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked , and the good land had become a desert . All the cities in that land were destroyed by the Lord and his great anger .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	27	This is what the Lord says : “ The whole country will be ruined , but I will not completely destroy the land .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	28	So the people in the land will cry for the dead . The sky will grow dark . I have spoken and will not change . I have made a decision , and I will not change my mind. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	4	29	The people of Judah will hear the sound of the horse soldiers and the archers , and the people will run away ! Some of them will hide in caves ; [ g ] some will hide in the bushes ; some will climb up into the rocks . All the cities of Judah will be empty . No one will live in them .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	30	Judah , you have been destroyed . So what are you doing now ? Why are you putting on your best red dress ? Why are you putting on your gold jewelry ? Why are you putting on your eye makeup ? You make yourself beautiful , but it is a waste of time . Your lovers hate you . They are trying to kill you .
ERV	Jeremiah	4	31	I hear a cry like a woman in labor , a scream like a woman giving birth to her first baby . It is the cry of daughter Zion . [ h ] She is lifting her hands in prayer , saying , “ Oh ! I am about to faint ! Murderers are all around me ! ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 4:4 Change your hearts Literally , “ Be circumcised to the Lord . Cut away the foreskin of your hearts. ” See “ circumcise , circumcision ” in the Word List . Jeremiah is saying that real circumcision must be from inside a person ’ s heart ( mind ) . - Jeremiah 4:6 north The Babylonian army came from this direction to attack Judah . Armies from countries north and east of Israel often came this way to attack Judah and Israel . - Jeremiah 4:15 land of Dan The people from the tribe of Dan lived near the border in the northern part of Israel .

ERV	Jeremiah	5	5	So I will go to the leaders of Judah . I will talk to them . Surely the leaders know the way of the Lord . Surely they know the law of their God. ” But the leaders had all joined together to break away from serving God .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	2	The people make promises and say , ‘ As the Lord lives. ’ But they don ’ t really mean it ! ”
ERV	Jeremiah	5	3	Lord , I know that you want people to be loyal to you . You hit the people of Judah , but they did not feel any pain . You destroyed them , but they refused to learn their lesson . They became very stubborn . They refused to be sorry for the bad things they did .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	4	But I said to myself , “ It must be only the poor who are so foolish . They have not learned the way of the Lord . They don ’ t know the teachings of their God .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	6	So a lion from the forest will attack them . A wolf from the desert will kill them . A leopard is hiding near their cities , to tear to pieces anyone who comes out . That ’ s because the people have sinned again and again . Many times they have wandered away from God .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	7	God says , “ People of Judah , why should I forgive you ? Your children have abandoned me . They made promises to idols that are not really gods ! I gave your children everything they needed , but they were still unfaithful to me ! They spent their time with prostitutes .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	8	They are like horses that have had plenty to eat and are ready to mate . They are like a horse that is calling its neighbor ’ s wife .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	9	Should I punish the people of Judah for doing these things ? ” This message is from the Lord . “ You know I should punish a nation such as this . I should give it the punishment it deserves .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	10	“ Go along the rows of Judah ’ s grapevines . Cut down the vines . ( But don ’ t completely destroy them . ) Cut off all their branches , because they don ’ t belong to the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	11	The family of Israel and the family of Judah have been unfaithful to me in every way. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	12	“ Those people lied about the Lord . They said , ‘ He will not do anything to us . Nothing bad will happen to us . We will never see an army attack us . We will never starve. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets are only empty wind . [ a ] The word of God is not in them . [ b ] Bad things will happen to them. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	5	14	The Lord God All-Powerful said these things : “ The people said I would not punish them . So , Jeremiah , the words I give you will be like fire , and these people will be like wood . That fire will burn them up completely. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	5	15	Family of Israel , this message is from the Lord . “ I will soon bring a nation from far away to attack you . It is an old nation ; it is an ancient nation . The people of that nation speak a language that you do not know . You can not understand what they say .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	16	Their arrow bags are like open graves . All their men are strong soldiers .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	17	They will eat all the crops that you gathered . They will eat all your food . They will destroy your sons and daughters . They will eat your flocks and your herds . They will eat your grapes and your figs . They will destroy your strong cities with their swords . They will destroy the strong cities that you trust in. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	5	18	This message is from the Lord : “ But , Judah , when these terrible days come , I will not fully destroy you .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	19	The people of Judah will ask you , ‘ Jeremiah , why has the Lord our God done this bad thing to us ? ’ Give them this answer : ‘ You people of Judah have left me , and you have served foreign idols in your own land . You did these things , so now you will serve foreigners in a land that does not belong to you. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	5	20	“ Tell this message to the family of Jacob , and tell it in the nation of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	21	Hear this message , you foolish people who have no sense . You have eyes , but you don ’ t see ! You have ears , but you don ’ t listen !
ERV	Jeremiah	5	22	Surely you are afraid of me. ” This message is from the Lord . “ You should shake with fear in front of me . I am the one who made the sandy shores to hold back the sea . I made it that way to keep the water in its place forever . The waves may pound the beach , but they will not destroy it . The waves may roar as they come in , but they can not go beyond the beach .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	23	But the people of Judah are stubborn . They are always planning ways to turn against me . They turned away from me and left me .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	24	The people of Judah never say to themselves , ‘ Let ’ s fear and respect the Lord our God . He gives us autumn and spring rains at just the right time . He makes sure that we have the harvest at just the right time. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	5	25	You don ’ t have these blessings because you have done wrong . Your sins have kept these good things away from you .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	26	There are evil men among my people . They are like men who make nets for catching birds . [ c ] They set their traps , but they catch people instead of birds .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	27	Their houses are full of lies , like a cage full of birds . Their lies made them rich and powerful .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	28	They have grown big and fat from the evil they have done . There is no end to the evil they do . They will not plead the case of children who have no parents . They will not help these orphans . They will not let the poor be judged fairly .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	29	Should I punish the people of Judah for doing these things ? ” This message is from the Lord . “ You know I should punish a nation such as this . I should give it the punishment it deserves .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	30	“ A terrible and shocking thing has happened in the land of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	5	31	The prophets tell lies . The priests will not do what they were chosen to do , [ d ] and my people love it this way ! But what will you people do when your punishment comes ? Footnotes - Jeremiah 5:13 wind This is a wordplay . The Hebrew word for wind is like the word for spirit . - Jeremiah 5:13 The word … them Literally , “ And the ‘ He said ’ is not in them. ” - Jeremiah 5:26 men … birds The Hebrew text here is hard to understand . - Jeremiah 5:31 priests … were chosen to do The Hebrew text here is hard to understand .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	6	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Cut down the trees around Jerusalem , and build a siege mound [ d ] against it . This city should be punished because inside there is no justice—only slavery .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	2	Jerusalem , [ b ] you are like a beautiful meadow . [ c ] But I will destroy you !
ERV	Jeremiah	6	3	Enemy shepherds will surround you with all their flocks . They will set up their tents all around you , and each one will let his sheep eat the grass .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	4	“ Get ready to fight against Jerusalem . Get up ! We will attack the city at noon . But it is already getting late . The evening shadows are growing long .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	5	So get up ! We will attack the city at night ! Let ’ s destroy the strong walls that are around Jerusalem. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	6	7	As a well keeps its water fresh , so Jerusalem keeps its wickedness fresh . I hear about the robbing and violence in this city all the time . I see nothing but pain and sickness there all the time .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	8	Listen to this warning , Jerusalem , or I will turn my back on you . I will make your land an empty desert . No one will be able to live there. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	6	9	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Gather [ e ] the people of Israel who were left on their land . Gather them the way you would gather the last grapes on a grapevine . Check each vine , like the workers check each vine when they pick the grapes. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	6	10	Who can I speak to ? Who can I warn ? Who will listen to me ? The people of Israel have closed their ears , so they can not hear my warnings . They don ’ t like the Lord ’ s teachings . They don ’ t want to hear his message .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	11	But I am full of the Lord ’ s anger , and I am tired of holding it in ! “ Pour out my anger on the children playing in the streets and on the young soldiers gathered there as well . A man and his wife will both be captured as well as all the old people .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	12	Their houses will be given to others . Their fields and their wives will be given to other people . I will raise my hand and punish the people of Judah. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	13	“ All the people of Israel want more and more money . All of them , from the least important to the most important , are like that . Even the prophets and priests tell lies .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	14	They should bandage the wounds my people have suffered , but they treat their wounds like small scratches . They say , ‘ It ’ s all right , everything is all right. ’ But it is not all right !
ERV	Jeremiah	6	15	They should be ashamed of the evil things they do , but they are not ashamed at all . They don ’ t know enough to be embarrassed by their sins . So they will be punished with everyone else . They will be thrown to the ground when I punish the people. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	16	This is what the Lord says : “ Stand at the crossroads and look . Ask where the old road is . Ask where the good road is , and walk on that road . If you do , you will find rest for yourselves . But you people have said , ‘ We will not walk on the good road. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	6	17	I chose watchmen to watch over you . I told them , ‘ Listen for the sound of the war trumpet. ’ But they said , ‘ We will not listen ! ’
ERV	Jeremiah	6	18	So listen , all you nations , and pay attention , you people in those countries . [ f ]
ERV	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear this , people of the earth : I am going to bring disaster to the people of Judah because of all the evil they planned , and because they ignored my messages . They refused to obey my law .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	20	“ Why do you bring me incense from the country of Sheba [ g ] ? Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway country ? Your burnt offerings don ’ t make me happy . Your sacrifices don ’ t please me. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	6	21	So this is what the Lord says : “ I will give the people of Judah problems . They will be like stones that make people fall . Fathers and sons will stumble over them . Friends and neighbors will die. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	6	22	This is what the Lord says : “ An army is coming from the north . [ h ] A great nation is coming from faraway places on earth .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	23	The soldiers carry bows and spears . They are cruel ; they have no mercy . They are so powerful . They sound like the roaring ocean as they ride their horses . That army is coming , ready for battle . It is coming to attack you , Jerusalem . [ i ] ”
ERV	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard the news about that army , and we are paralyzed with fear . We feel trapped by our troubles , in pain like a woman giving birth .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	25	Don ’ t go out into the fields . Don ’ t go on the roads because the enemy has swords , and there is danger everywhere .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	26	My people , put on sackcloth and roll in the ashes . [ j ] Cry loudly for the dead . Cry as if you lost an only son . Do this because the destroyer will come against us very quickly .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	27	“ Jeremiah , I want you to be like a worker who tests metals . You will test my people and watch how they live .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	28	My people have turned against me , and they are very stubborn . They say bad things about people . They are like bronze and iron that are covered with rust and tarnish .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	29	They are like a worker who tried to make silver pure . The bellows [ k ] blew strongly , and the fire became hotter , but only lead came from the fire . [ l ] The worker wasted his time trying to make that silver pure . In the same way the evil was not removed from my people .
ERV	Jeremiah	6	30	My people will be called ‘ Rejected Silver. ’ They will be given that name because the Lord did not accept them. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 6:1 north The Babylonian army came from this direction to attack Judah .

ERV	Jeremiah	7	7	If you obey me , I will let you live in this place . I gave this land to your ancestors for them to keep forever .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	2	“ Jeremiah , stand at the gate of the Lord ’ s house . Teach this message at the gate : “ ‘ Hear the message from the Lord , all you people of the nation of Judah . All you who come through these gates to worship the Lord , hear this message .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	3	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : Change your lives and do good things . If you do this , I will let you live in this place . [ a ]
ERV	Jeremiah	7	4	. - Jeremiah 7:29 cut … away This showed that Jeremiah was sad .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	5	If you change your lives and do good things , I will let you live in this place . You must be fair to each other .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	6	You must be fair to strangers . You must help widows and orphans . Don ’ t kill innocent people ! And don ’ t follow other gods , because they will only ruin your lives .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	8	“ ‘ But you are trusting lies that are worthless .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	9	Will you steal and murder ? Will you commit adultery ? Will you falsely accuse other people ? Will you worship the false god Baal and follow other gods that you have not known ?
ERV	Jeremiah	7	10	If you commit these sins , do you think that you can stand before me in this house that is called by my name ? Do you think you can stand before me and say , “ We are safe , ” just so you can do all these terrible things ?
ERV	Jeremiah	7	11	This Temple is called by my name . Is this Temple nothing more to you than a hideout for robbers ? I have been watching you. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	12	“ ‘ You people of Judah , go now to the town of Shiloh . Go to the place where I first made a house for my name . The people of Israel also did evil things . Go and see what I did to that place because of the evil they did . [ c ]
ERV	Jeremiah	7	13	You people of Israel were doing all these evil things . This message is from the Lord ! I spoke to you again and again , but you refused to listen to me . I called to you , but you did not answer .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	14	So I will destroy the house called by my name in Jerusalem . I will destroy that Temple as I destroyed Shiloh . And that house in Jerusalem that is called by my name is the Temple you trust in . I gave that place to you and to your ancestors .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	15	I will throw you away from me just as I threw away all your brothers from Ephraim. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	7	16	“ As for you , Jeremiah , don ’ t pray for these people of Judah . Don ’ t beg for them or pray for them . Don ’ t beg me to help them . I will not listen to your prayer for them .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	17	I know you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah . You can see what they are doing in the streets of the city of Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	18	This is what the people of Judah are doing : The children gather wood . The fathers use the wood to make a fire . The women make the dough and then make cakes of bread to offer to the Queen of Heaven . The people of Judah pour out drink offerings to worship other gods . They do this to make me angry .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	19	But I am not the one they are really hurting. ” This message is from the Lord . “ They are only hurting themselves . They are bringing shame on themselves. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	7	20	So this is what the Lord God says : “ I will show my anger against this place . I will punish people and animals . I will punish the trees in the field and the crops that grow in the ground . My anger will be like a hot fire—no one will be able to stop it. ” Obedience Is Better Than Sacrifice
ERV	Jeremiah	7	21	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ Go and offer as many burnt offerings and sacrifices as you want . Eat the meat of those sacrifices yourselves .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	22	I brought your ancestors out of Egypt . I spoke to them , but I did not give them any commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	23	I only gave them this command : ‘ Obey me and I will be your God , and you will be my people . Do all that I command , and good things will happen to you. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	7	24	“ But your ancestors did not listen to me . They did not pay attention to me . They were stubborn and did what they wanted to do . They did not become good . They became even more evil—they went backward , not forward .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	25	From the day that your ancestors left Egypt to this day , I have sent my servants to you . My servants are the prophets . I sent them to you again and again .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	26	But your ancestors did not listen to me . They did not pay attention to me . They were very stubborn and did evil even worse than their fathers did .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	27	“ Jeremiah , you will tell these things to the people of Judah . But they will not listen to you . You call to them , but they will not answer you .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	28	So you must tell them these things : ‘ This is the nation that did not obey the Lord its God . These people did not listen to God ’ s teachings . They don ’ t know the true teachings. ’ The Valley of Slaughter
ERV	Jeremiah	7	29	“ Jeremiah , cut off your hair and throw it away . [ d ] Go up to the bare hilltop and cry , because the Lord has rejected this generation of people . He has turned his back on these people . And in anger he will punish them .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	30	Do this because I have seen the people of Judah doing evil things. ” This message is from the Lord . “ They have set up their idols , and I hate those idols . They have set up idols in the Temple that is called by my name . They have made my house ‘ dirty ’ !
ERV	Jeremiah	7	31	The people of Judah built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom where they killed their own sons and daughters and burned them as sacrifices . This is something I never commanded . Something like this never even entered my mind !
ERV	Jeremiah	7	32	So I warn you . The days are coming , ” says the Lord , “ when people will not call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom anymore . No , they will call it the Valley of Slaughter . They will give it this name because they will bury the dead people in Topheth until there is no more room to bury anyone else .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	33	Then the bodies of the dead people will become food for the birds of the sky . Wild animals will eat the bodies of those people . There will be no one left alive to chase the birds or animals away .
ERV	Jeremiah	7	34	I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and happiness in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . There will be no more sounds of the bride and bridegroom in Judah or Jerusalem . The land will become an empty desert. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 7:3 I will … place This can also mean “ I will live with you. ” - Jeremiah 7:4 This is … Lord Many people in Jerusalem thought the Lord would always protect the city where his Temple was , so it didn ’ t matter how evil they were . - Jeremiah 7:12 Go … they did Shiloh was probably destroyed by the Philistines in the time of Eli and Samuel . See
ERV	Jeremiah	7	1	Sam .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	8	“ ‘ You keep saying , “ We have the Lord ’ s teachings . So we are wise ! ” But this is not true , because the scribes have lied with their pens .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	2	They will spread the bones on the ground under the sun , the moon , and the stars . The people of Jerusalem love to worship the sun , the moon , and the stars . No one will gather the bones and bury them again . So the bones of those people will be like dung thrown on the ground .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	3	“ I will force the people of Judah to leave their homes and their land . They will be taken away to foreign lands . Some of the people of Judah who were not killed in the war will wish that they had been killed. ” This message is from the Lord All-Powerful . Sin and Punishment
ERV	Jeremiah	8	4	“ Jeremiah , say this to the people of Judah : ‘ This is what the Lord says : “ ‘ You know if a man falls down , he gets up again . And if a man goes the wrong way , he turns around and comes back .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	5	The people of Judah went the wrong way . But why do the people of Jerusalem continue going the wrong way ? They believe their own lies . They refuse to turn around and come back .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	6	I have listened to them very carefully , but they don ’ t say what is right . They are not sorry for their sins . They don ’ t think about the evil they have done . They do things without thinking . They are like horses running into a battle .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	7	Even the birds in the sky know the right time to do things . The storks , doves , swifts , and thrushes know when it is time to fly to a new home . But my people don ’ t know what the Lord wants them to do .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	9	These “ wise people ” refused to listen to the Lord ’ s teachings . So they are not really wise at all . These “ wise people ” were trapped . They became shocked and ashamed .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	10	So I will give their wives to other men . I will give their fields to new owners . All the people of Israel want more and more money . All of them , from the least important to the most important , are like that . Even the prophets and priests tell lies .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	11	They should bandage the wounds my people have suffered , but they treat their wounds like small scratches . They say , “ It ’ s all right , everything is all right. ” But it is not all right !
ERV	Jeremiah	8	12	They should be ashamed of the evil things they do , but they are not ashamed at all . They don ’ t know enough to be embarrassed by their sins . So they will be punished with everyone else . They will be thrown to the ground when I punish the people. ’ ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	13	“ ‘ I will take away their fruit and crops so that there will be no harvest , says the Lord . There will be no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig tree . Even the leaves will become dry and die . I will take away the things I gave them. ’ ” [ a ]
ERV	Jeremiah	8	14	“ They will say , ‘ Why are we just sitting here ? Come , let ’ s run to the strong cities . If the Lord our God is going to make us die , then let ’ s die there . We have sinned against the Lord , so he has given us poisoned water to drink .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	15	We hoped to have peace , but nothing good has come . We hoped that he would forgive us , but only disaster has come .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	16	From the land of the tribe of Dan , we hear the snorting [ b ] of the enemy ’ s horses . The ground shakes from the pounding of their hooves . They have come to destroy the land and everything in it . They have come to destroy the city and all the people who live there. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	8	17	“ People of Judah , I am sending poisonous snakes [ c ] to attack you . These snakes can not be controlled . They will bite you. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	18	God , I am very sad and afraid .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	19	Listen to my people . Everywhere in this country , people are crying for help . They say , “ Is the Lord still at Zion ? Is Zion ’ s King still there ? ” But God says , “ The people of Judah worshiped their worthless foreign idols . That made me very angry ! Why did they do that ? ”
ERV	Jeremiah	8	20	And the people say , “ Harvest time is over . Summer is gone , and still we have not been saved. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	8	21	My people are hurt , so I am hurt . I am too sad to speak .
ERV	Jeremiah	8	22	Surely there is some medicine in Gilead . Surely there is a doctor in Gilead . So why are the wounds of my people not healed ?

ERV	Jeremiah	9	9	Should I punish the people of Judah for doing these things ? ” This message is from the Lord . “ You know I should punish a nation such as this . I should give it the punishment it deserves. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	2	If only I had a place in the desert— a house where travelers spend the night— so I could leave my people . I could go away from them , because they are all unfaithful to God . They have all turned against him .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	3	“ They use their tongues like a bow ; lies fly from their mouths like arrows . Lies , not truth , have grown strong in this land . They go from one sin to another . They don ’ t know me. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	4	“ Watch your neighbors ! Don ’ t trust your own brothers , because every brother is a cheat . Every neighbor talks behind your back .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	5	Everyone lies to their neighbor . No one speaks the truth . The people of Judah have taught their tongues to lie . They sinned until they were too tired to come back .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	6	One bad thing followed another , and lies followed lies . The people refused to know me. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	7	So the Lord All-Powerful says , “ A worker heats metal in a fire to test it and see if it is pure . I will test the people of Judah like that . I have no other choice . My people have sinned .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	8	The people of Judah have tongues as sharp as arrows . Their mouths speak lies . They all speak kindly to their neighbors , but they are secretly planning ways to attack them .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	10	I , Jeremiah , will cry for the mountains . I will sing a funeral song for the empty fields , because all the animals were taken away . No one travels there now . The sounds of cattle can not be heard . The birds have flown away , and the animals are gone .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	11	The Lord says , [ a ] “ I will make the city of Jerusalem a pile of garbage . It will be a home for jackals . I will destroy the cities in the land of Judah , so no one will live there. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	12	Is there a man who is wise enough to understand these things ? Is there someone who has been taught by the Lord ? Can anyone explain his message ? Why was the land ruined ? Why was it made like an empty desert where no one goes ?
ERV	Jeremiah	9	13	The Lord answered , “ It is because the people of Judah stopped following my teachings . I gave them my teachings , but they refused to listen to me . They did not follow my teachings .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	14	The people of Judah lived their own way . They were stubborn . They followed the false god Baal . Their fathers taught them to follow those false gods. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	15	So the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says , “ I will soon make the people of Judah eat bitter food and drink poisoned water .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter the people of Judah throughout other nations . They will live in strange nations that they and their fathers never knew about . I will send men with swords . They will kill the people of Judah . They will kill them until all the people are gone. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	17	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Now think about these things ! Call for the women who get paid to cry at funerals . Send for the people who are good at that job .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	18	The people say , ‘ Let those women come quickly and cry for us . Then our eyes will fill with tears that flow over our eyelids like streams of water. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	9	19	“ The sound of loud crying is heard from Zion : ‘ We are really ruined ! We are so ashamed ! We must leave our land , because our houses have been destroyed . Now our houses are only piles of rock. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	20	Now , women of Judah , listen to the message from the Lord . Listen to the words from his mouth . Teach your daughters how to cry loudly . Each of them must learn to sing this funeral song :
ERV	Jeremiah	9	21	“ Death has climbed in through our windows and has come into our palaces . Death has come to our children who play in the streets and to the young men who meet in the public places. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	22	This is what you should say : “ The Lord says , ‘ Dead bodies will lie in the fields like dung . Their bodies will lie on the ground like grain a farmer has cut . But there will be no one to gather them. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	9	23	This is what the Lord says : “ The wise must not brag about their wisdom . The strong men must not brag about their strength . The rich must not brag about their money .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	24	But if someone wants to brag , then let them brag about this : Let them brag that they learned to know me . Let them brag that they understand that I am the Lord , that I am kind and fair , and that I do good things on earth . I love this kind of bragging. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	25	This is what the Lord says : “ The time is coming when I will punish all those who are circumcised only in the body .
ERV	Jeremiah	9	26	I am talking about the people of the nations of Egypt , Judah , Edom , Ammon , Moab , and all those who live in the desert . The circumcision they do is not the kind the Lord wants . But the people of Israel are not really circumcised either . They are not circumcised in their hearts . [ b ] ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 9:11 The Lord says This is implied from the context . - Jeremiah 9:26 circumcised in their hearts See the note at Jer . 4:4 .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	10	But the Lord is the only true God . He is the only God who is alive . He is the King who rules forever . The earth shakes when he is angry . The people of the nations can not stop his anger .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	2	This is what the Lord says : “ Don ’ t live like people from other nations . Don ’ t be afraid of special signs in the sky . [ a ] The other nations are afraid of what they see in the sky . But you must not be afraid of them .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	3	The customs of other people are worth nothing . Their idols are nothing but wood from the forest . Their idols are made by workers with their chisels . [ b ]
ERV	Jeremiah	10	4	They make their idols beautiful with silver and gold . They use hammers and nails to fasten their idols down so that they will not fall over .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	5	The idols of the other nations are like a scarecrow in a cucumber field . They can not walk . They can not talk , and the people must carry them . So don ’ t be afraid of their idols . They can not hurt you . And they can not help you either. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	10	6	Lord , there is no one like you . You are great ! Your name is great and powerful !
ERV	Jeremiah	10	7	Everyone should respect you , King of all the nations . You deserve their respect . There are many wise men among the nations , but not one of them is as wise as you .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	8	All the people of the other nations are stupid and foolish . Their teachings come from worthless wooden statues .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	9	They use silver from the city of Tarshish and gold from the city of Uphaz and make their statues . Carpenters and metalworkers make the idols . They put blue and purple clothes on them . “ Wise men ” make these “ gods. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	10	11	The Lord says , “ Tell them this message : ‘ These false gods did not make heaven and earth . They will be destroyed and disappear from heaven and earth. ’ ” [ c ]
ERV	Jeremiah	10	12	God is the one who used his power and made the earth . He used his wisdom and built the world . With his understanding he stretched the sky over the earth .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	13	God causes the loud thunder , and he causes great floods of water to fall from the sky . He makes clouds rise in the sky every place on earth . He sends lightning with the rain . He brings out the wind from his storehouses .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	14	People are so stupid ! Metalworkers are fooled by the idols that they themselves made . These statues are nothing but lies . They are stupid . [ d ]
ERV	Jeremiah	10	15	These idols are worth nothing . They are something to make fun of . In the time of judgment they will be destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	16	But Jacob ’ s God [ e ] is not like the idols . He made everything , and Israel is the family that God chose to be his own people . His name is Lord All-Powerful . Destruction Is Coming
ERV	Jeremiah	10	17	Get everything you own and prepare to leave . People of Judah , you are trapped in the city , and the enemy is all around it .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	18	This is what the Lord says : “ This time , I will throw the people of Judah out of this country . I will bring pain and trouble to them . I will do this so that they will learn their lesson. ” [ f ]
ERV	Jeremiah	10	19	I am hurt badly . I am injured and I can not be healed . But I told myself , “ This is my sickness ; I must suffer through it. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	10	20	My tent is ruined . All its ropes are broken . My children left me . They are gone . No one is left to put up my tent . No one is left to fix a shelter for me .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	21	The shepherds are stupid . They don ’ t try to find the Lord . They are not wise , so their flocks are scattered and lost .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! A loud noise ! The noise is coming from the north . [ g ] It will destroy the cities of Judah . Judah will become an empty desert . It will be a home for jackals .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	23	Lord , I know that our lives do not belong to us . We have no control over what happens .
ERV	Jeremiah	10	24	So correct us , Lord ! But please be fair . Don ’ t punish us in anger , or you will destroy us !
ERV	Jeremiah	10	25	If you are angry , then punish the other nations . They don ’ t know or respect you . They don ’ t worship you . Those nations destroyed Jacob ’ s family . They destroyed Israel completely . They destroyed Israel ’ s homeland .

ERV	Jeremiah	11	11	So this is what the Lord says : “ I will soon make something terrible happen to the people of Judah . They will not be able to escape . They will be sorry and cry to me for help , but I will not listen to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	2	“ Jeremiah , listen to the words of this agreement and tell them to the people living in Jerusalem and the rest of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	3	Tell them that this is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Bad things will happen to anyone who does not obey this agreement .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	4	I am talking about the agreement I made with your ancestors when I brought them out of that furnace [ a ] called Egypt. ’ At that time I told them , ‘ Listen to me and obey all the commands I give you . Then you will be my people and I will be your God. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	11	5	“ I did this to keep the promise that I had made to your ancestors . I promised to give them a very fertile land—a land flowing with milk and honey . And you are living in that country today. ” I answered , “ Amen , Lord. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	11	6	The Lord said to me , “ Jeremiah , tell this message in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem : ‘ Listen to the words of this agreement , and then obey these laws .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	7	I gave a warning to your ancestors at the time I brought them out of the land of Egypt . I have warned them again and again to this day . I told them to obey me .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	8	But your ancestors did not listen to me . They were stubborn and did what their own evil hearts wanted . The agreement says that bad things will happen to them if they don ’ t obey . So I made all the bad things happen to them . I commanded them to obey the agreement , but they did not. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	11	9	The Lord said to me , “ Jeremiah , I know that the people of Judah and the people living in Jerusalem have made secret plans .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	10	They are committing the same sins that their ancestors did . Their ancestors refused to listen to my message . They followed and worshiped other gods . The family of Israel and the family of Judah have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	11	12	The people in the towns of Judah and in the city of Jerusalem will go and pray to their idols for help . They burn incense to those idols . But their idols will not be able to help the people of Judah when that terrible disaster comes .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	13	“ People of Judah , you have many idols—there are as many idols as there are towns in Judah . You have built many altars for worshiping that disgusting god Baal—there are as many altars as there are streets in Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	14	“ As for you , Jeremiah , don ’ t pray for these people of Judah . Don ’ t beg for them . Don ’ t say prayers for them . I will not listen . They will suffer and then call to me for help , but I will not listen .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	15	“ Judah is the one I love , but why is she in my temple ? She has done too many evil things . Judah , do you think vows and sacrifices will keep you from being destroyed ? Will I then allow you to enjoy your evil ways ? ”
ERV	Jeremiah	11	16	The Lord gave you a name . He called you , “ A green olive tree , beautiful to look at. ” But with a powerful storm , he will set that tree on fire , and its branches will be burned up . [ b ]
ERV	Jeremiah	11	17	The Lord All-Powerful planted you , and he said that disaster will come to you . That is because the family of Israel and the family of Judah have done evil things . They offered sacrifices to Baal , and that made him angry ! Evil Plans Against Jeremiah
ERV	Jeremiah	11	18	The Lord showed me that the men of Anathoth [ c ] were making plans against me . He showed me what they were doing , so I knew they were against me .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	19	Before he showed me this , I was like a gentle lamb waiting to be butchered . I did not understand that they were against me . They were saying this about me : “ Let us destroy the tree and its fruit ! Let us kill him ! Then people will forget him. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	11	20	So I prayed , “ Lord All-Powerful , you are a fair judge . You know how to test people ’ s hearts and minds . I will tell you my arguments , and I will let you give them the punishment they deserve. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	11	21	The Lord said to me , “ Those people from Anathoth are planning to take your life . They are telling you not to prophesy in the name of the Lord or they will kill you . This is what I have to say about them :
ERV	Jeremiah	11	22	I , the Lord All-Powerful , promise that I will soon punish those people . Their young men will die in war . Their sons and daughters will die from hunger .
ERV	Jeremiah	11	23	No one from the city of Anathoth will be left . No one will survive . I will punish them and cause something bad to happen to them. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 11:4 furnace Literally , “ iron furnace. ” That is , an oven hot enough to soften iron so that it can be hammered into something useful . - Jeremiah 11:16 The meaning of these verses is uncertain . - Jeremiah 11:18 men of Anathoth Anathoth was Jeremiah ’ s hometown . The people who were plotting against him there included his own relatives . See Jer . 12:6 .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	12	The empty hills are covered with soldiers who have come to destroy everything . The Lord is using them to punish that land from one end to the other . No one is safe .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	2	You have put these wicked people here like plants with strong roots . They grow and produce fruit . With their mouths they say that you are near and dear to them , but in their hearts they are really far away from you .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	3	But you know my heart , Lord . You see me and test my mind . Drag the evil people away like sheep to be killed . Choose them for the day of slaughter .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	4	How much longer will the land be dry ? How long will the grass be dry and dead ? The birds and the animals of this land have all died , and it is the fault of the wicked . But they are saying , “ Jeremiah will not live long enough to see what happens to us. ” God ’ s Answer to Jeremiah
ERV	Jeremiah	12	5	“ Jeremiah , if running in a race against men makes you tired , how will you race against horses ? If you trip and fall in a safe place , what will you do in a dangerous place ? What will you do in the thornbushes that grow along the Jordan River ?
ERV	Jeremiah	12	6	These men are your own brothers . Members of your own family are making plans against you . People from your own family are shouting at you . Don ’ t trust them , even when they speak to you like friends . The Lord Rejects Judah
ERV	Jeremiah	12	7	“ I have abandoned my house . I have left my own property . [ a ] I have given Judah , the one I love , to her enemies .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	8	My own people turned against me like a wild lion . They roared at me , so I turned away from them .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	9	My own people have become like a dying animal surrounded by vultures . These birds are circling around her . Come on , wild animals . Come get something to eat .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard . They have trampled the plants in my field . They have made my beautiful field a desert .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	11	They have turned it into an empty desert . It is dry and dead . The whole land has been ruined , and no one is left to care for it .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	13	The people will plant wheat , but they will harvest only thorns . They will work hard until they are very tired , but they will get nothing for all their work . They will be ashamed of their crop . The Lord ’ s anger caused this. ” The Lord ’ s Promise to Israel ’ s Neighbors
ERV	Jeremiah	12	14	This is what the Lord says : “ I will tell you what I will do for all those who live around the land of Israel . They are very wicked . They have destroyed the land I gave to the people of Israel . I will pull the evil people up and throw them out of their land , and I will pull the people of Judah up with them .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	15	But after I pull them up out of their land , I will feel sorry for them . I will bring each family back to its own property and to its own land .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	16	I want these people to learn their lessons well . In the past they taught my people to use Baal ’ s name to make promises . Now , I want them to learn to use my name . I want them to say , ‘ As the Lord lives …. ’ If they do that , I will allow them to be successful , and I will let them live among my people .
ERV	Jeremiah	12	17	But if a nation does not listen to my message , I will completely destroy it . I will pull it up like a dead plant. ” This message is from the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 12:7 house … my own property That is , the people of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	13	Then you will say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I will make everyone who lives in this land helpless , like a drunken man . I am talking about the kings who sit on David ’ s throne . I am also talking about the priests , the prophets , and all the people who live in Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a linen loincloth , just as the Lord told me to do , and I put it around my waist .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	3	Then the message from the Lord came to me a second time .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	4	This was the message : “ Jeremiah , take the loincloth you bought and are wearing , and go to Perath . [ b ] Hide the loincloth there in a crack in the rocks. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went to Perath and hid the loincloth there , just as the Lord told me to do .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	6	Many days later the Lord said to me , “ Now , Jeremiah , go to Perath . Get the loincloth that I told you to hide there. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	13	7	So I went to Perath and dug the loincloth out of the crack in the rocks where I had hidden it . But now I could not wear the loincloth , because it was ruined . It was not good for anything .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	8	Then the message from the Lord came to me .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	9	This is what the Lord said : “ The loincloth is ruined and not good for anything . In the same way , I will ruin the proud people of Judah and Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	10	I will ruin them because they refuse to listen to my messages . They are stubborn and do only what they want to do . They follow and worship other gods . They will be like this linen loincloth . They will be ruined and not good for anything .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	11	A loincloth is wrapped tightly around a man ’ s waist . In the same way , I wrapped the family of Israel and the family of Judah around me. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I did that so that they would be my people and bring me fame , praise , and honor . But my people did not listen to me. ” Warnings to Judah
ERV	Jeremiah	13	12	“ Jeremiah , say to the people of Judah : ‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : Every wineskin should be filled with wine. ’ They will laugh and say to you , ‘ Of course , we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	13	14	I will make them stumble and fall against each other , even the fathers and sons. ’ This message is from the Lord . ‘ I will not feel sorry or have pity for them . I will not allow compassion to stop me from destroying the people of Judah. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	13	15	Listen and pay attention . The Lord has spoken to you . Do not be proud .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	16	Honor the Lord your God . Praise him or he will bring darkness . Praise him before you fall on the dark hills . You people of Judah are hoping for light , but the Lord will turn the light into thick darkness . He will change it into the deepest gloom .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	17	If you people of Judah don ’ t listen to him , I will hide and cry . Your pride will cause me to cry . I will cry very hard . My eyes will overflow with tears , because the Lord ’ s flock [ c ] will be captured .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	18	Tell these things to the king and his wife , “ Come down from your thrones . Your beautiful crowns have fallen from your heads. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities in the Negev are locked . No one can open them . All the people of Judah have been taken away as captives . They were carried away as prisoners .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	20	Jerusalem , look ! The enemy is coming from the north [ d ] ! Where is the flock [ e ] you were once in charge of ? That beautiful flock is gone now .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	21	I will let your enemies become your rulers— people you once trusted with your secrets . What will you say then ? Surely you will feel great pain , like a woman giving birth .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	22	You might ask yourself , “ Why has this bad thing happened to me ? ” It happened because of your many sins . Because of your sins , your skirt was torn off , and your sandals were taken away . They did this to embarrass you .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	23	A black man can not change the color of his skin , and a leopard can not change its spots . In the same way , Jerusalem , you can not change and do good . You always do bad things .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	24	“ I will force you to leave your homes . You will run in all directions . You will be like chaff blown away by the desert wind .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	25	This is what will happen to you . This is your part in my plans. ” This message is from the Lord . “ Why will this happen ? Because you forgot me . You trusted false gods .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	26	Jerusalem , I will pull your skirt up over your face . Everyone will see you , and you will be ashamed .
ERV	Jeremiah	13	27	I saw the terrible things you did . [ f ] I saw you laughing and having sex with your lovers . I know about your plans to be like a prostitute . I have seen you on the hills and in the fields . It will be very bad for you , Jerusalem . How long will you continue doing your dirty sins ? ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 13:1 loincloth A common undergarment in ancient Judah . It was a short skirt that was wrapped around the hips . It reached about halfway down the thighs . - Jeremiah 13:4 Perath Probably a village near Jerusalem . This town is called Parah in the list of the cities of the land of Benjamin in Josh . 18:23 . But this name also means the Euphrates River . - Jeremiah 13:17 Lord ’ s flock This is a figurative name for the people of Judah . The Lord is thought of as a shepherd , while his people are seen as his flock of sheep . - Jeremiah 13:20 north The Babylonian army came from this direction to attack Judah . Armies from countries north and east of Israel often came this way to attack Judah and Israel . - Jeremiah 13:20 flock Here , the word “ flock ” refers to all the towns around Jerusalem , as if Jerusalem were the shepherd and the towns of Judah were her flock . - Jeremiah 13:27 I saw … you did This is probably talking about worshiping false gods . But part of that worship was having sex with temple prostitutes .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said to me , “ Jeremiah , those prophets are telling lies in my name . I did not send them or command them or speak to them . Their prophecies came from false visions , worthless magic , and their own wishful thinking .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	2	“ The nation of Judah cries for people who have died . The people in the cities of Judah grow weaker and weaker . They lie on the ground . People in Jerusalem , cry to God for help .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	3	The leaders of the people send their servants to get water . The servants go to the water storage places , but they don ’ t find any water . The servants come back with empty jars , so they are ashamed and embarrassed . They cover their heads from shame .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	4	No one prepares the ground for crops . [ b ] No rain falls on the land . The farmers are depressed . So they cover their heads from shame .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	5	Even the mother deer in the field leaves her newborn baby alone , because there is no grass .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	6	Wild donkeys stand on the bare hills . They sniff the wind like jackals . But their eyes can not find any food , because there are no plants to eat .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	7	“ We know that this is our fault . We are now suffering because of our sins . Lord , do something to help us for the good of your name . We admit that we have left you many times . We have sinned against you .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	8	God , you are the hope of Israel ! You save Israel in times of trouble . But now it seems like you are a stranger in the land , like a traveler who only stays one night .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	9	You seem like a man who has been attacked by surprise , like a soldier who does not have the power to save anyone . But , Lord , you are with us . We are called by your name , so don ’ t leave us without help ! ”
ERV	Jeremiah	14	10	This is what the Lord says about the people of Judah : “ The people of Judah really love to leave me . They don ’ t stop themselves from leaving me . So now the Lord will not accept them . Now he will remember the evil they do . He will punish them for their sins. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	14	11	Then the Lord said to me , “ Jeremiah , don ’ t pray for good things to happen to the people of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	12	They might begin to fast and pray to me , but I will not listen to their prayers . Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings to me , I will not accept them . I will destroy the people of Judah with war . I will take away their food , and they will starve . And I will destroy them with terrible diseases. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	14	13	But I said , “ Lord God , the prophets were telling the people something different . They were telling the people of Judah , ‘ You will not suffer from war or from hunger . The Lord will give you peace in this land. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	14	15	So this is what I , the Lord , say about the prophets who are speaking in my name . I did not send them . They said , ‘ No enemy will ever attack this country . There will never be hunger in this land. ’ So those prophets will die from hunger or by an enemy ’ s sword .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people they spoke to will be thrown into the streets . The people will die from hunger and war . I will punish them , and no one will be there to bury them , their wives , their sons , or their daughters .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	17	“ Jeremiah , speak this message to the people of Judah : ‘ My eyes fill with tears night and day without stopping . I cry for my virgin daughter , [ c ] and for my dear people , because someone hit them and crushed them . They have been hurt very badly .
ERV	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go into the country , I see the bodies of those killed in war . If I go into the city , I see people sick from hunger . The priests and prophets continue their work , but they don ’ t understand what is happening. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	14	19	Lord , have you completely rejected the nation of Judah ? Do you hate Zion ? You hurt us so badly that we can not be made well again . Why did you do that ? We were hoping for peace , but nothing good has come . We were hoping for a time of healing , but only terror came .

Jeremiah Complains to God Again
ERV	Jeremiah	15	10	Mother , I am sorry that you gave birth to me . I am the one who must accuse and criticize the whole land . I have not loaned or borrowed anything , but everyone curses me .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	11	Surely , Lord , I have served you well . In times of disaster and trouble , I prayed to you about my enemies . God Answers Jeremiah
ERV	Jeremiah	15	12	“ Jeremiah , you know that no one can shatter a piece of iron . I mean the kind of iron that is from the north . [ c ] And no one can shatter a piece of bronze either .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	13	The people of Judah have many treasures . I will give these riches to other people . They will not have to buy them , because Judah has many sins . The people sinned in every part of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	14	People of Judah , I will make you slaves of your enemies . You will be slaves in a land that you never knew . I am very angry . My anger is like a hot fire , and you will be burned. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	15	16	Your words came to me , and I ate them up . They made me very happy . I was glad to be called by your name , Lord God All-Powerful .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	17	I never sat with the crowd as they laughed and had fun . I sat by myself because of your influence on me . You filled me with anger at the evil around me .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	18	I don ’ t understand why I still hurt . I don ’ t understand why my wound is not cured and can not be healed . I think you have changed . You are like a spring of water that became dry . You are like a spring whose water has stopped flowing .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	19	Then the Lord said , “ Jeremiah , if you change and come back to me , I will not punish you . If you change and come back to me , then you may serve me . If you speak important things , not worthless words , then you may speak for me . The people of Judah should change and come back to you . But don ’ t you change and be like them .
ERV	Jeremiah	15	20	I will make you strong . The people will think you are strong , like a wall made of bronze . The people of Judah will fight against you , but they will not defeat you . They will not defeat you , because I am with you . I will help you , and I will save you. ” This message is from the Lord .

After that happens , I will send for many hunters [ a ] to come to this land . They will hunt the people of Judah on every mountain and hill and in the cracks of the rocks .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	2	“ Jeremiah , you must not get married . You must not have sons or daughters in this place. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	16	3	This is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters who are born in the land of Judah and about their mothers and fathers :
ERV	Jeremiah	16	4	“ They will die from terrible disease . And no one will cry for them or bury them . Their bodies will lie on the ground like dung . Or they will die in war or starve to death . Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the earth. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	16	5	So the Lord says , “ Jeremiah , don ’ t go into a house where people are eating a funeral meal . Don ’ t go there to cry for the dead or to show your sorrow . Don ’ t do these things , because I have taken back my blessing . I will not be kind to the people of Judah . I will not feel sorry for them. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	6	“ Important people and common people will die in the land of Judah . No one will bury them or cry for them . No one will cut himself or shave his head to show sorrow for them .

ERV	Jeremiah	16	8	“ Jeremiah , don ’ t go into a house where the people are having a party . Don ’ t go into that house and sit down to eat and drink .

ERV	Jeremiah	16	10	“ Jeremiah , you will tell the people of Judah these things , and the people will ask you , ‘ Why has the Lord said these terrible things to us ? What have we done wrong ? What sin have we done against the Lord our God ? ’
ERV	Jeremiah	16	11	You must tell them : ‘ Terrible things will happen to you because your ancestors stopped following me. ’ This message is from the Lord . ‘ They stopped following me and began to follow and serve other gods . They worshiped those other gods . Your ancestors left me and stopped obeying my law .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	12	But you people have sinned more than your ancestors . You are very stubborn , and you are doing only what you want to do . You are not obeying me . Because you do only what you want to do ,
ERV	Jeremiah	16	13	I will throw you out of this country . I will force you to go to a foreign land . You will go to a land that you and your ancestors never knew . There you can serve false gods all you want to . I will not help you or show you any favors. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	16	14	“ People make promises and say , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives—the Lord who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt …. ’ But the time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when people will not say that .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	15	They will say something new . They will say , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives—the Lord who brought the Israelites out of the northern land , who brought them out of all the countries where he had sent them …. ’ Why will they say that ? Because I will bring the Israelites back to the land that I gave to their ancestors .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	17	I see everything they do . The people of Judah can not hide the things they do . Their sin is not hidden from me .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	18	I will pay the people of Judah back for the evil things they did—I will punish them two times for every sin . I will do this because they have made my land ‘ dirty. ’ They made my land ‘ dirty ’ with their terrible idols . I hate those idols , but they have filled my country with their idols. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	16	19	Lord , you are my strength and my protection . You are a safe place to run to in time of trouble . The nations will come to you from all around the world . They will say , “ Our fathers had false gods . They worshiped those worthless idols , but the idols did not help them .
ERV	Jeremiah	16	20	Can people make real gods for themselves ? No , they can only make statues that are not really gods. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	16	21	“ So I will teach those who make idols . Right now I will teach them about my power and my strength . Then they will know that I am God . They will know that I am the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 16:16 fishermen … hunters This means the enemy soldiers from Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	17	Please don ’ t make me afraid of you . I depend on you in times of trouble .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	2	Their children remember the altars that were dedicated to false gods . They remember the wooden poles that were dedicated to Asherah . They remember those things under the green trees and on the hills .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	3	They remember those things on the mountains in the open country . The people of Judah have many treasures . I will give those things to other people . People will destroy all the high places in your country . You worshiped there , and that was a sin .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	4	You will lose the land I gave you . I will let your enemies take you to be their slaves . That is because I am very angry . My anger is like a hot fire , and you will be burned forever. ” Trusting in People and Trusting in God
ERV	Jeremiah	17	5	This is what the Lord says : “ Bad things will happen to those who put their trust in people . Bad things will happen to those who depend on human strength . That is because they have stopped trusting the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	6	They are like a bush in a desert where no one lives . It is in a hot and dry land . It is in bad soil . That bush does not know about the good things that God can give .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	7	“ But those who trust in the Lord will be blessed . They know that the Lord will do what he says .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	8	They will be strong like trees planted near a stream that send out roots to the water . They have nothing to fear when the days get hot . Their leaves are always green . They never worry , even in a year that has no rain . They always produce fruit .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	9	“ Nothing can hide its evil as well as the human mind . It can be very sick , and no one really understands it .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	10	But I am the Lord , and I can look into a person ’ s heart . I can test a person ’ s mind and decide what each one should have . I can give each person the right payment for what they do .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	11	Sometimes a bird will hatch an egg that it did not lay . Those who cheat to get money are like that bird . But when their lives are half finished , they will lose the money . At the end of their lives , it will be clear that they were fools. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	17	12	From the very beginning , our Temple has been a glorious throne for God . It is a very important place .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	13	Lord , you are the hope of Israel . You are like a spring of living water . Those who stop following the Lord will have a very short life . [ b ] Jeremiah ’ s Third Complaint
ERV	Jeremiah	17	14	Lord , if you heal me , I surely will be healed . Save me , and I surely will be saved . Lord , I praise you !
ERV	Jeremiah	17	15	The people of Judah continue to ask me questions . They say , “ Jeremiah , what about the message from the Lord ? Let ’ s see that message come true. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	17	16	Lord , I did not run away from you . I followed you . I became the shepherd [ c ] you wanted . I did not want the terrible day to come . You know what I said . You see all that is happening .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	18	People are hurting me . Make them ashamed , but don ’ t disappoint me . Let them be filled with fear , but don ’ t give me any reason to fear . Bring the terrible day of disaster to my enemies . Break them , and break them again . Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy
ERV	Jeremiah	17	19	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Jeremiah , go and stand at the People ’ s Gate , [ d ] where the kings of Judah go in and out . Tell the people my message , and then go to all the other gates of Jerusalem and do the same. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	17	20	Say to the people , “ Listen to this message from the Lord . Listen , kings of Judah . Listen , all you people of Judah . All you who come through these gates into Jerusalem , listen to me !
ERV	Jeremiah	17	21	This is what the Lord says : ‘ Be careful that you don ’ t carry a load on the Sabbath day . And don ’ t bring a load through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	22	Don ’ t bring a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day . Don ’ t do any work on that day . You must make the Sabbath day a holy day . I gave this same command to your ancestors ,
ERV	Jeremiah	17	23	but they did not obey me . They did not pay attention to me . Your ancestors were very stubborn . I punished them , but it did not do any good . They did not listen to me .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	24	But you must be careful to obey me , says the Lord . You must not bring a load through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath . You must make the Sabbath day a holy day . You will do this by not doing any work on that day .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	25	“ ‘ If you obey this command , the kings and leaders will be from David ’ s family . It will be the kings who sit on David ’ s throne and the leaders from Judah and Jerusalem who come through the gates of Jerusalem riding on chariots and on horses . And Jerusalem will have people living in it forever .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	26	People will come to Jerusalem from the towns and villages of Judah , from the land where the tribe of Benjamin lives , [ e ] from the western foothills , from the hill country , and from the Negev . All these people will bring burnt offerings , sacrifices , grain offerings , incense , and thank offerings to the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	17	27	“ ‘ But if you don ’ t listen to me and obey me , bad things will happen . If you carry loads into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day , you are not keeping it as a holy day . So I will start a fire that can not be put out . That fire will start at the gates of Jerusalem , and it will burn until it burns even the palaces. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 17:1 horns of their altars The corners of altars were shaped like horns , and the blood of sacrifices was smeared on them . So Jeremiah may mean that the people ’ s sins have made their altars unfit for sacrifices . - Jeremiah 17:13 will have a very short life Literally , “ he will be written in the dirt. ” This might mean that a person ’ s name was written on a list of people who would soon die , or that a person ’ s life will soon be gone—like a name written in the sand . - Jeremiah 17:16 shepherd God ’ s people are sometimes called his “ sheep , ” and the person who takes care of them is called the “ shepherd. ” - Jeremiah 17:19 People ’ s Gate This might be one of the gates into Jerusalem or perhaps one of the southern gates into the Temple area used by those who were not priests . - Jeremiah 17:26 the land where … Benjamin lives The land of Benjamin was just north of the land of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	18	Then the enemies of Jeremiah said , “ Come , let us make plans against Jeremiah . We will always have a priest to tell us what the law says . We will still have wise men to advise us and prophets to tell us a message from God . So who needs Jeremiah ? Let ’ s tell lies to ruin him and stop listening to what he says. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Jeremiah , go down to the potter ’ s house . I will give you my message there. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to the potter ’ s house and saw him working with clay at the wheel .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	4	He was making a pot from clay . But there was something wrong with the pot . So the potter used that clay to make another pot . With his hands he shaped the pot the way he wanted it to be .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	5	Then this message from the Lord came to me :
ERV	Jeremiah	18	6	“ Family of Israel , you know that I can do the same thing with you . You are like the clay in the potter ’ s hands , and I am the potter. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	7	“ There may come a time when I will speak about a nation or a kingdom that I will pull up by its roots or tear down and destroy it .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	8	But if the people of that nation change their hearts and lives and stop doing evil things , I will change my mind and not bring on them the disaster I planned .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	9	There may come another time when I speak about a nation that I will build up or plant .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	10	But if I see that nation doing evil things and not obeying me , I will think again about the good I had planned to do for them .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	11	“ So , Jeremiah , say to the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem , ‘ This is what the Lord says : I am the potter preparing troubles for you and making plans against you . So stop doing the evil things you are doing . Each person must change and start doing good. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	18	12	But the people of Judah will answer , ‘ We don ’ t care what you say . We will continue to do what we want . We will do the evil our stubborn hearts want. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	18	13	Listen to what the Lord says : “ Ask the other nations this question : ‘ Have you ever heard of anything so bad ? ’ Israel , who is as dear to me as a young daughter , has done this terrible thing !
ERV	Jeremiah	18	14	It is as strange as not finding snow on Lebanon ’ s mountains or seeing the cool streams that come from there stop flowing . That just does not happen !
ERV	Jeremiah	18	15	But my people have forgotten me . They burn offerings to worthless idols . They have left the right way that their ancestors followed , and they stumble on the path they have chosen . Instead of staying on the good road I showed them , they prefer to walk on bumpy paths .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	16	So their land will become an empty desert , a place for people from now on to make fun of . All who pass by there will be shocked by what has happened . They will just shake their heads at what they see .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	17	Like a strong east wind , I will scatter my people . I will use their enemies to scatter them like dust . When disaster comes upon them , they will see me leaving , not coming to help. ” The People Plan Evil and Jeremiah Prays
ERV	Jeremiah	18	19	Lord , listen to me ! Listen to what my enemies are saying .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	20	I have done only good to them . It is not right for them to pay me back with evil . But they are preparing a death trap for me ! Remember that I prayed to you for them . I asked only good for them . I tried to keep you from punishing them in anger .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	21	So now make their children starve to death ! Let their enemies kill them with swords . Let their wives lose their children and husbands . Let their men die from disease , and let their young men be killed in battle .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	22	Let them cry out in their houses , when you suddenly bring an enemy against them . Let it happen because they prepared a death trap for me . They hid traps for me to step in .
ERV	Jeremiah	18	23	Lord , you know about their plans to kill me . So don ’ t forgive their crimes or erase their sins . Make them fall down in defeat . Punish them in your anger !
ERV	Jeremiah	19	19	The Lord said to me , “ Jeremiah , go and buy a clay jar from a potter . Take some of the elders of the people and some priests with you .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	2	Go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom , near the front of the Potsherd Gate . [ a ] I have a message I want you to announce there .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	3	Say to those who are with you , ‘ King of Judah and people of Jerusalem , listen to this message from the Lord ! This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : I will soon make a terrible thing happen to this place ! Everyone who hears about it will be amazed and full of fear .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	4	I will do these things because the people of Judah have stopped following me . They have made this a place for foreign gods . The people of Judah have burned sacrifices in this place to other gods . The people long ago did not worship those gods . Their ancestors did not worship them . These are new gods from other countries . The kings of Judah filled this place with the blood of innocent children .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	5	The kings of Judah built high places for the god Baal . They use those places to burn their sons in the fire . They burned their sons as burnt offerings to the god Baal . I did not tell them to do that . I did not ask them to offer their sons as sacrifices . I never even thought of such a thing .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	6	Now people call this place Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom . But I give you this warning . This message is from the Lord : The days are coming , when people will call this place the Valley of Slaughter .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	7	At this place , I will ruin the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem . The enemy will chase them , and I will let the people of Judah be killed with swords in this place . I will make their dead bodies food for the birds and wild animals .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	8	I will completely destroy this city . People will whistle and shake their heads when they pass by Jerusalem . They will be shocked when they see how the city was destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	9	The enemy will bring its army around the city . That army will not let people go out to get food , so the people in the city will begin to starve . They will become so hungry that they will eat the bodies of their own sons and daughters , and then they will begin to eat each other. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	19	10	“ Jeremiah , tell this to the people , and while they are watching , break the jar .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	11	Then say this : ‘ The Lord All-Powerful says , I will break the nation of Judah and the city of Jerusalem , just as someone breaks a clay jar ! And like a broken jar , the nation of Judah can not be put together again . It will be the same for the nation of Judah . The dead people will be buried here in Topheth until there is no more room .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	12	I will do this to these people and to this place . I will make this city like Topheth. ’ This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	19	13	‘ The houses in Jerusalem will become as “ dirty ” as this place , Topheth . The kings ’ palaces will be ruined like this place , Topheth , because the people worshiped false gods on the roofs of their houses . [ b ] They worshiped the stars and burned sacrifices to honor them . They gave drink offerings to false gods. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	19	14	Then Jeremiah left Topheth where the Lord had told him to speak . Jeremiah went to the Lord ’ s Temple and stood in the courtyard of the Temple . Jeremiah said to all the people :
ERV	Jeremiah	19	15	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel says : ‘ I said I would bring many disasters to Jerusalem and the villages around it . I will soon make this happen because the people are very stubborn . They refuse to listen and obey me. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 19:2 Potsherd Gate The exact location of this gate is not known , though it was probably at the southwestern part of the city . - Jeremiah 19:13 roofs of their houses People built their houses with flat roofs that were used as an extra room .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	20	Pashhur son of Immer was a priest . He was the highest officer in the Temple of the Lord . When he heard Jeremiah say those things in the Temple yard ,
ERV	Jeremiah	20	2	he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten . And he had Jeremiah ’ s hands and feet locked between large blocks of wood . This was at the Upper Gate of Benjamin of the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day Pashhur took Jeremiah out from between the blocks of wood . Then Jeremiah said to him , “ The Lord ’ s name for you is not Pashhur . Now his name for you is ‘ Surrounded by Terror. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	20	4	That is your name because of what the Lord says : ‘ I will soon make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends . You will watch enemies killing your friends with swords . I will give all the people of Judah to the king of Babylon . He will take them away to the country of Babylon , and his army will kill the people of Judah with their swords .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	5	The people of Jerusalem worked hard to build things and become wealthy , but I will give all these things to their enemies . The king in Jerusalem has many treasures , but I will give all the treasures to the enemy . The enemy will take them and carry them away to the country of Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	6	And , Pashhur , you and all the people living in your house will be taken away . You will be forced to go and live in the country of Babylon . You will die in Babylon , and you will be buried in that foreign country . You told lies to your friends . You said these things would not happen . But all your friends will also die and be buried in Babylon. ’ ” Jeremiah ’ s Fifth Complaint
ERV	Jeremiah	20	7	Lord , you tricked me , and I certainly was fooled . You are stronger than I am , so you won . I have become a joke . People laugh at me and make fun of me all day long .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	8	Every time I speak , I shout . I am always shouting about violence and destruction . I tell the people about the message that I received from the Lord . But they only insult me and make fun of me .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	9	Sometimes I say to myself , “ I will forget about him . I will not speak anymore in his name. ” But when I say that , his message is like a fire burning inside me ! It feels like it is burning deep in my bones ! I get tired of trying to hold his message inside . And finally , I am not able to hold it in .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	10	I hear people whispering against me . Everywhere , I hear things that frighten me . Even my friends are speaking against me . People are just waiting for me to make a mistake . They are saying , “ Let us lie and say that he did something bad . Maybe we can trick Jeremiah . Then we will have him . We will finally be rid of him . Then we will grab him and take our revenge on him. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	20	11	But the Lord is with me . He is like a strong soldier . So those who are chasing me will fall . They will not defeat me . They will fail . They will be disappointed . They will be ashamed , and they will never forget that shame .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	12	Lord All-Powerful , you test good people . You look deeply into a person ’ s mind . I told you my arguments against these people . So let me see you give them the punishment they deserve .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing to the Lord ! Praise the Lord ! He saves the lives of the poor ! He saves them from the wicked ! Jeremiah ’ s Sixth Complaint
ERV	Jeremiah	20	14	Curse the day that I was born ! Don ’ t bless the day my mother had me .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	15	Curse the man who told my father the news that I was born . “ It ’ s a boy ! ” he said . “ You have a son. ” He made my father very happy when he told him the news .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	16	Let that man be like the cities the Lord destroyed . [ a ] He had no pity on them . Let him hear shouts of war in the morning ; let him hear battle cries at noontime ,
ERV	Jeremiah	20	17	because he did not kill me while I was in my mother ’ s womb . If he had killed me then , my mother would have been my grave , and I would not have been born .
ERV	Jeremiah	20	18	Why did I have to come out of her body ? All I have seen is trouble and sorrow , and my life will end in shame . Footnotes - Jeremiah 20:16 cities the Lord destroyed That is , Sodom and Gomorrah . See Gen.
ERV	Jeremiah	20	19	.
ERV	Jeremiah	21	21	This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord . This was when King Zedekiah of Judah sent Pashhur [ a ] son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah . They brought a message for Jeremiah .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	2	They said to Jeremiah , “ Pray to the Lord for us . Ask him what will happen . We want to know , because King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is attacking us . Maybe the Lord will do great things for us , as he did in the past . Maybe he will make Nebuchadnezzar stop attacking us and leave. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	21	3	Then Jeremiah answered Pashhur and Zephaniah . He said , “ Tell King Zedekiah ,
ERV	Jeremiah	21	4	‘ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says : You have weapons of war in your hands that you are using to defend yourselves from the Babylonians and their king . But I will make those weapons worthless . “ ‘ The army from Babylon is outside the wall all around the city . Soon I will bring that army into Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	5	I myself will fight against you people of Judah . I will fight against you with my own powerful hand . I am very angry with you , so I will fight against you with my own powerful arm . I will fight very hard against you and show how angry I am .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	6	I will kill everything living in Jerusalem , both people and animals . They will die from a terrible disease that will spread all through the city .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	7	After that happens , ’ ” says the Lord , “ ‘ I will give King Zedekiah of Judah and all his officials to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . And I will give to Nebuchadnezzar the people who remain alive in Jerusalem—those who did not die from the terrible disease and the people who did not die in war or from hunger . I will give them all to King Nebuchadnezzar . The people of Judah will be captured by their enemies who want to kill them . Nebuchadnezzar ’ s army will use their swords to kill the people of Judah and Jerusalem . Nebuchadnezzar will not show any mercy . He will not feel sorry for them. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	21	8	“ Also tell the people of Jerusalem , ‘ This is what the Lord says : Understand that I will let you choose to live or die .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	9	Anyone who stays in Jerusalem will die in war or from hunger or disease . But anyone who goes out of Jerusalem and surrenders to the Babylonians attacking you will live . Only those who leave the city will win anything in this war—their lives !
ERV	Jeremiah	21	10	I have decided to make trouble for the city of Jerusalem . I will not help this city ! I will give it to the king of Babylon , who will burn it with fire. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	11	“ Say this to Judah ’ s royal family : ‘ Listen to the message from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	12	Family of David , this is what the Lord says : “ ‘ You must judge people fairly every day . Protect the victims from the criminals . If you don ’ t do that , I will become very angry . My anger will be like a fire that no one will be able to put out . This will happen because you have done evil things. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	21	13	“ Jerusalem , I am against you . You sit on top of the mountain . You sit like a queen over this valley . You people of Jerusalem say , ‘ No one can attack us . No one can come into our strong city. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	21	14	“ You will get the punishment you deserve . I will start a fire in your forests that will completely burn everything around you. ” This message is from the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 21:1 Pashhur This is not the same Pashhur as the man in Jer . 20:1 .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	22	Judah , the punishment I give will come like a storm , and it will blow all your shepherds away . You thought some of the other nations would help you . But these nations will also be defeated . Then you will really be disappointed . You will be ashamed of all the evil things you did .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	2	‘ Listen to this message from the Lord , King of Judah . You rule from David ’ s throne , so listen . King , you and your officials must listen well . All of your people who come through the gates of Jerusalem must listen to the message from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	3	This is what the Lord says : Do what is right and fair . Protect those who have been robbed from the ones who robbed them . Don ’ t hurt or do anything wrong to orphans or widows . Don ’ t kill innocent people .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	4	If you obey these commands , kings who sit on David ’ s throne will continue to come through the gates into the city of Jerusalem . They will come through the gates with their officials . The kings , their officials , and their people will come riding in chariots and on horses .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	5	But I , the Lord , tell you that if you don ’ t obey these commands , then I promise with an oath in my own name that this king ’ s palace will be destroyed—it will become a pile of rocks. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	22	6	This is what the Lord says about the palace where the king of Judah lives : “ The palace is tall like the forests of Gilead , like the mountains of Lebanon . But I will make it like a desert , as empty as a city where no one lives .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	7	I will send men to destroy the palace , each armed with weapons . They will cut up your strong , beautiful cedar beams and throw them into the fire .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	8	“ People from many nations will pass by this city . They will ask one another , ‘ Why has the Lord done such a terrible thing to Jerusalem ? Jerusalem was such a great city. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	22	9	This will be the answer to that question : ‘ God destroyed Jerusalem because the people of Judah stopped following the agreement of the Lord their God . They worshiped and served other gods. ’ ” Judgment Against King Jehoahaz
ERV	Jeremiah	22	10	Don ’ t cry for the king who has died . [ a ] Don ’ t cry for him . But cry very hard for the king who must leave this place . [ b ] Cry for him because he will never return or see his homeland again .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	11	This is what the Lord says about Jehoahaz [ c ] son of Josiah , who became king of Judah after his father Josiah died : “ Jehoahaz has gone away from Jerusalem . He will never return .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	12	Jehoahaz will die in the place where the Egyptians have taken him , and he will not see this land again. ” Judgment Against King Jehoiakim
ERV	Jeremiah	22	13	“ It will be very bad for King Jehoiakim . He is doing wrong so that he can build his palace . He is cheating people so that he can build rooms upstairs . He is not paying his own people . He is making them work for nothing .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	14	“ Jehoiakim says , ‘ I will build myself a great palace , with huge rooms upstairs. ’ So he built it with large windows . He used cedar wood for paneling , and he painted it red .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	15	“ Jehoiakim , having a lot of cedar in your house does not make you a great king . Your father Josiah was satisfied to have food and drink . He did what was right and fair , so everything went well for him .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	16	Josiah helped poor and needy people , so everything went well for him . Jehoiakim , what does it mean “ to know God ” ? It means living right and being fair . That is what it means to know me . This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	17	“ Jehoiakim , your eyes look only for what benefits yourself . You are always thinking about getting more for yourself . You are willing to kill innocent people . You are willing to steal things from other people. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	22	18	So this is what the Lord says to King Jehoiakim son of Josiah : “ The people of Judah will not cry for Jehoiakim . They will not say to each other , ‘ Brother , I am so sad ! Sister , I am so sad ! ’ They will not cry for Jehoiakim . They will not say about him , ‘ Master , I am so sad ! King , I am so sad ! ’
ERV	Jeremiah	22	19	The people of Jerusalem will bury Jehoiakim like a donkey . They will drag his body away and throw it outside the gates of Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	20	“ Judah , go up to the mountains of Lebanon and cry out . Let your voice be heard in the mountains of Bashan . Cry out in the mountains of Abarim , because all your ‘ lovers ’ will be destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	21	“ Judah , you felt safe , but I warned you . I warned you , but you refused to listen . You have lived like this from the time you were young . And from the time you were young , you have not obeyed me , Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	23	“ King , you seem so safe in your palace of cedar . It ’ s as if you live in Lebanon ! [ d ] But when your punishment comes , you will groan . You will be in pain like a woman giving birth ! ” Judgment Against King Jehoiachin
ERV	Jeremiah	22	24	“ As surely as I live , ” says the Lord , “ I will do this to you , Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , king of Judah : Even if you were a signet ring on my right hand , I would still pull you off .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	25	Jehoiachin , I will give you to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Babylonians . Those are the people you are afraid of . They want to kill you .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	26	I will throw you and your mother into another country where neither of you was born . You and your mother will die in that country .
ERV	Jeremiah	22	27	Jehoiachin , you will want to come back to your land , but you will never be allowed to come back. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	22	28	Jehoiachin is like a broken pot that someone threw away . He is like a pot that no one wants . Why will Jehoiachin and his children be thrown out and sent away into a foreign land ?
ERV	Jeremiah	22	29	Land , land , land of Judah ! Listen to this message from the Lord !
ERV	Jeremiah	22	30	The Lord says , “ Write this down about Jehoiachin : ‘ He does not have children anymore ! Jehoiachin will not be successful because none of his children will sit on the throne of David . None of his children will rule in Judah. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 22:10 the king who has died That is , King Josiah who was killed in battle against the Egyptians in
ERV	Jeremiah	22	609	B.C . - Jeremiah 22:10 the king … place This means Josiah ’ s son , Jehoahaz . He became king after Josiah died . He is also called Shallum . King Neco of Egypt defeated Josiah . And Neco took Jehoahaz off the throne of Judah and made him a prisoner in Egypt . - Jeremiah 22:11 Jehoahaz The Hebrew text has “ Shallum , ” another name for Jehoahaz . - Jeremiah 22:23 It ’ s as if … Lebanon The king ’ s palace in Jerusalem was built with wood from the mountains of Lebanon , which was famous for its cedar trees .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	23	This message is from the Lord . “ I am God , and I am always near . I am not far away .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	2	. - Jeremiah 23:33 heavy load This is a wordplay . The Hebrew word for “ announcement ” is like the word translated “ heavy load . ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	3	“ I sent my sheep to other countries . But I will gather together my sheep that are left , and I will bring them back to their pasture . When my sheep are back in their pasture , they will have many children and grow in number .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	4	I will place new shepherds over my sheep . They will take care of my sheep , and my sheep will never again feel afraid . None of my sheep will be lost. ” This message is from the Lord . The Good “ Branch ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	5	This message is from the Lord : “ The time is coming , when I will raise up a good ‘ branch ’ from David ’ s family . He will be a king who will rule in a wise way . He will do what is fair and right in the land .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	6	When he rules , Judah will be saved , and Israel will live in safety . This will be his name : The Lord Makes Things Right for Us . [ a ]
ERV	Jeremiah	23	7	“ So the time is coming , ” says the Lord , “ when people will not make a promise by saying , ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , the one who brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt …. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	23	8	But people will say something new : ‘ As surely as the Lord lives , the one who brought the Israelites out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had sent them …. ’ Then the people of Israel will live in their own land. ” Judgments Against False Prophets
ERV	Jeremiah	23	9	A message to the prophets : I am very sad—my heart is broken . All my bones are shaking . Because of the Lord and his holy words , I am like a man who is drunk .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	10	The land of Judah is full of people who commit adultery . They are unfaithful in many ways . So God cursed the land , and it became very dry . The plants are dried and dying in the pastures . The fields have become like the desert . The prophets are evil . They use their influence and power in the wrong way .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	11	This message is from the Lord : “ The prophets and even the priests are evil . I have seen them doing evil things in my own Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	12	I will stop giving my messages to them . They will walk in darkness . The road will be slippery for those prophets and priests , and they will fall in that darkness . I will bring disaster on them ; I will punish them. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	13	“ I saw the prophets of Samaria doing wrong things . I saw them prophesy in the name of the false god Baal . They led the people of Israel away from me .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	14	I have even seen the prophets of Jerusalem doing sinful things . They are committing adultery and living a life of lies . They support their fellow prophets and never stop doing evil . They have become like Sodom ; they are all like Gomorrah. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	15	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful says about those Jerusalem prophets : “ I will make them suffer . Their food will be bitter , their water like poison . I will punish them because they started a spiritual sickness that spread through the whole country. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	16	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Don ’ t pay attention to what those prophets are saying to you . They are trying to fool you . They talk about visions , but they did not get their visions from me . Their visions come from their own minds .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	17	Some of the people hate the real messages from the Lord , so the prophets give them a different message . They say , ‘ You will have peace. ’ Some of the people are very stubborn . They do only what they want to do . So the prophets say , ‘ Nothing bad will happen to you ! ’
ERV	Jeremiah	23	18	But none of these prophets has stood in the heavenly council . [ b ] None of them has seen or heard the message from the Lord . None of them has paid close attention to his message .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	19	Now the punishment from the Lord will come like a storm . His anger will be like a tornado . It will come crashing down on the heads of those wicked people .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	20	The Lord ’ s anger will not stop until he finishes what he plans to do . When that day is over , you will understand this clearly .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	21	I did not send those prophets , but they ran to tell their messages . I did not speak to them , but they spoke in my name .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	22	If they had stood in my heavenly council , then they would have told my messages to the people of Judah . They would have stopped the people from doing bad things . They would have stopped them from doing evil. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	24	Someone might try to hide from me in some hiding place . But it is easy for me to see that person , says the Lord , because I am everywhere in heaven and earth. ” This message is from the Lord :
ERV	Jeremiah	23	25	“ There are prophets who tell lies in my name . They say , ‘ I have had a dream ! I have had a dream ! ’ I heard them say those things .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will this continue ? They think up lies and then they teach them to the people .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	27	They are trying to make the people of Judah forget my name by telling each other these false dreams . They are trying to make my people forget me , just as their ancestors forgot me and worshiped the false god Baal .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	28	Straw is not the same as wheat ! In the same way , the dreams of those prophets are not messages from me . If people want to tell about their dreams , let them . But those who hear my message must speak it truthfully. ” This is what the Lord says .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	29	Yes , the Lord says , “ You must treat my message carefully , like a fire or like a hammer that can smash a rock. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	30	This message is from the Lord : “ So I am against the false prophets . They keep stealing my words from each other. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	23	31	Yes , the Lord says , “ I am against the false prophets . They use their own words and pretend that it is a message from me .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	32	I am against the false prophets who tell false dreams. ” This message is from the Lord . “ They mislead my people with their lies and false teachings . I did not send them to teach the people . I never commanded them to do anything for me . They can not help the people of Judah at all. ” This message is from the Lord . The Sad Message From the Lord
ERV	Jeremiah	23	33	“ The people of Judah , or a prophet , or a priest may ask you , ‘ Jeremiah , what is the announcement of the Lord ? ’ You will answer them and say , ‘ You are a heavy load [ c ] , and I will throw down this heavy load. ’ This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	34	“ A prophet , or a priest , or maybe one of the people might say , ‘ This is an announcement from the Lord …. ’ Because of that lie , I will punish that person and their whole family .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	35	This is what you will say to one another : ‘ What did the Lord answer ? ’ or ‘ What did the Lord say ? ’
ERV	Jeremiah	23	36	But you will never again use the expression , ‘ The announcement of the Lord. ’ That is because his message should not be a heavy load for anyone . But you changed the words of our God . He is the living God , the Lord All-Powerful !
ERV	Jeremiah	23	37	“ If you want to learn about God ’ s message , ask a prophet , ‘ What answer did the Lord give you ? ’ or ‘ What did the Lord say ? ’
ERV	Jeremiah	23	38	But don ’ t say , ‘ What was the announcement from the Lord ? ’ If you use these words , the Lord will say this to you : ‘ You should not have called my message an “ announcement from the Lord. ” I told you not to use those words .
ERV	Jeremiah	23	39	But you called my message a heavy load , so I will pick you up like a heavy load and throw you away from me . I gave the city of Jerusalem to your ancestors . But I will throw you and that city away from me ,
ERV	Jeremiah	23	40	and I will make you a disgrace forever . You will never forget your shame. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 23:6 The Lord Makes Things Right for Us This is a wordplay . In Hebrew this is like the name Zedekiah , the king of Judah at the time this prophecy was probably given . But Jeremiah is talking about another king . - Jeremiah 23:18 heavenly council The people in the Old Testament often talk about God as the leader of a council of heavenly beings ( angels ) . Compare
ERV	Jeremiah	23	1	and
ERV	Jeremiah	24	24	The Lord showed me these things : I saw two baskets of figs arranged in front of the Temple of the Lord . ( I saw this vision after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took Jehoiachin [ a ] as a prisoner . Jehoiachin , the son of King Jehoiakim , and all his important officials were taken away from Jerusalem . They were taken to Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar also took away all the carpenters and metalworkers of Judah . )
ERV	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs in it , the kind that ripen early in the season . But the other basket had rotten figs . They were too rotten to eat .
ERV	Jeremiah	24	3	The Lord said to me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” I answered , “ I see figs . The good figs are very good , and the rotten figs are very rotten . They are too rotten to eat. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	24	4	Then the message from the Lord came to me .
ERV	Jeremiah	24	5	The Lord , the God of Israel , said , “ The people of Judah were taken from their country . Their enemy brought them to Babylon . Those people will be like these good figs . I will be kind to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	24	6	I will protect them . I will bring them back to the land of Judah . I will not tear them down—I will build them up . I will not pull them up—I will plant them so that they can grow .
ERV	Jeremiah	24	7	I will make them want to know me . They will know that I am the Lord . They will be my people , and I will be their God . I will do this because the prisoners in Babylon will turn to me with their whole hearts. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	24	8	But the Lord also says , “ I will treat King Zedekiah of Judah like those figs that are too rotten to eat . Zedekiah , his high officials , all those who are left in Jerusalem , and those people of Judah who are living in Egypt will be like those rotten figs .
ERV	Jeremiah	24	9	I will punish them . Their punishment will shock all the people on earth . People will make fun of those people from Judah . People will tell jokes about them and curse them in all the places where I scatter them .
ERV	Jeremiah	24	10	I will bring war , famine , and disease against them . I will attack them until they have all been killed . Then they will no longer be on the land that I gave to them and to their ancestors. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 24:1 Jehoiachin The Hebrew text has “ Jeconiah , ” another name for King Jehoiachin , who was taken prisoner in the year
ERV	Jeremiah	24	597	B.C .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	25	I made all the kings from Zimri , Elam , and Media drink from the cup .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	2	This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the people of Jerusalem :
ERV	Jeremiah	25	3	I have been a prophet for these past
ERV	Jeremiah	25	23	I made the people of Dedan , Tema , and Buz drink from the cup . I made all those who cut their hair at their temples drink from the cup .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	4	The Lord has sent his servants , the prophets , to you over and over again . But you have not listened to them . You have not paid any attention to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	5	Those prophets said , “ Change your lives and stop doing evil ! If you change , you can return to the land that the Lord gave you and your ancestors long ago . He gave you this land to live in forever .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	6	Don ’ t follow other gods . Don ’ t serve or worship them . Don ’ t worship idols that someone has made . That only makes me angry with you . By doing this you only hurt yourselves. ” [ b ]
ERV	Jeremiah	25	7	“ But you did not listen to me. ” This message is from the Lord . “ You worshiped idols that someone made , and that made me angry . And it only hurt you. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	25	8	So this is what the Lord All-Powerful says , “ You have not listened to my messages .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	9	I will soon send for all the tribes of the north . [ c ] ” This message is from the Lord . “ I will soon send for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . He is my servant . I will bring those people against the land of Judah and against the people of Judah . I will bring them against all the nations around you too . I will destroy all those countries . I will make those lands like an empty desert forever . People will see those countries , and whistle at how badly they were destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	10	I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and happiness in those places . There will be no more happy sounds of the brides and bridegrooms . I will take away the sound of people grinding meal . I will take away the light of the lamp .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	11	That whole area will be an empty desert . All these people will be slaves of the king of Babylon for
ERV	Jeremiah	25	70	years have passed , I will punish the king of Babylon . I will punish the nation of Babylon. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I will punish the land of the Babylonians for their sins . I will make that land a desert forever .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	12	“ But when the
ERV	Jeremiah	25	13	I said many bad things will happen to Babylon , and all of them will happen . Jeremiah spoke about those foreign nations . And all the warnings are written in this book .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	14	Yes , the people of Babylon will have to serve many nations and many great kings . I will give them the punishment they deserve for all the things they have done. ” Judgment on the Nations of the World
ERV	Jeremiah	25	15	The Lord , the God of Israel , said this to me : “ Jeremiah , take this cup of wine from my hand . It is the wine of my anger . I am sending you to different nations . Make all the nations drink from this cup .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	16	They will drink this wine . Then they will vomit and act like crazy people . They will do this because of the war that I will soon bring against them. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	25	17	So I took the cup of wine from the Lord ’ s hand . I went to those nations and I made them drink from the cup .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	18	I poured this wine for the people of Jerusalem and Judah . I made the kings and leaders of Judah drink from the cup . I did this so that they would become an empty desert . I did this so that place would be destroyed so badly that people would whistle and say curses about it . And it happened—Judah is like that now .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	19	I also made Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , drink from that cup . I made his officials , his important leaders , and all his people drink from it .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	20	I also made all the Arabs and all the kings of the land of Uz drink from the cup . I made all the kings of the land of the Philistines drink from the cup . These were the kings of the cities of Ashkelon , Gaza , Ekron , and what remains of the city Ashdod .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	21	Then I made the people of Edom , Moab , and Ammon drink from the cup .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	22	I made all the kings of Tyre and Sidon drink from the cup . I also made all the kings of the faraway countries drink from that cup .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	24	I made all the kings of Arabia drink from the cup . These kings live in the desert .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	26	I made all the kings of the north , those who were near and far , drink from the cup . I made them drink one after the other . I made all the kingdoms that are on earth drink from that cup . Finally , after all these other nations , the king of Babylon will drink from it too .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	27	“ Jeremiah , say to those nations , this is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ Drink this cup of my anger . Get drunk from it and vomit . Fall down and don ’ t get up . Don ’ t get up because I am bringing wars against you. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	25	28	“ They will refuse to take the cup from your hand . They will refuse to drink it , but you will tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : You will surely drink from this cup !
ERV	Jeremiah	25	29	I am already making these bad things happen to Jerusalem , the city that is called by my name . Maybe you people think that you will not be punished , but you are wrong . You will be punished ! I am giving the command for war to come against all the people of the earth. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	30	“ Jeremiah , you will give them this message : ‘ The Lord shouts from above . He shouts from his holy Temple . He shouts against his people . His shouts are loud like the songs of people walking on grapes to make wine .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	31	The noise spreads to all the people on earth . What is all the noise about ? The Lord tells why he is punishing all the nations . He has given his arguments against them . He has judged them , and now he is killing the wicked with his sword. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	32	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Disasters will soon spread from country to country . They will come like a powerful storm to all the faraway places on earth ! ”
ERV	Jeremiah	25	33	The dead bodies of those killed by the Lord will reach from one end of the earth to the other . No one will cry for them . No one will gather up their bodies and bury them . They will be left lying on the ground like dung .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	34	Shepherds , you should be leading the sheep . Start crying , you great leaders ! Roll around on the ground in pain , you leaders of the sheep . It is now time for your slaughter . You will be scattered everywhere , like pieces flying from a broken jar .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	35	There will be no place for the shepherds to hide . They will not escape .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	36	I hear the shepherds shouting . I hear the leaders of the sheep crying , because the Lord is destroying their pastures .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	37	Those peaceful pastures will be ruined because of the Lord ’ s anger .
ERV	Jeremiah	25	38	He is like an angry lion that has left his cave . And because of his terrible anger and by the attacks of the enemy army , their land will become an empty desert . Footnotes - Jeremiah 25:1 the fourth year … Jehoiakim This was about
ERV	Jeremiah	25	605	B.C . - Jeremiah 25:6 By doing this you only hurt yourselves This is from the ancient Greek version . The standard Hebrew text has “ Then I will not hurt you. ” - Jeremiah 25:9 north The Babylonian army came from this direction to attack Judah . Armies from countries north and east of Israel often came this way to attack Judah and Israel .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	26	This message came from the Lord during the first year that Jehoiakim [ a ] son of Josiah was king of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	2	The Lord said , “ Jeremiah , stand in the Temple yard of the Lord . Give this message to all the people of Judah who are coming to worship at the Temple of the Lord . Tell them everything that I tell you to speak . Don ’ t leave out any part of my message .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	3	Maybe they will listen and obey my message . Maybe they will stop living such evil lives . If they change , I will change my mind about my plans to punish them . I am planning this punishment because of the many evil things they have done .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	4	. - Jeremiah 26:18 empty hill Or “ high place , ” a term usually used for local shrines ( places for worship ) where people often worshiped idols .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	5	You must listen to what my servants say to you . The prophets are my servants . I have sent my prophets to you again and again , but you did not listen to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	6	If you don ’ t obey me , I will make my Temple in Jerusalem just like my Holy Tent at Shiloh . [ b ] People all over the world will think of Jerusalem when they ask for bad things to happen to other cities. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	26	7	and
ERV	Jeremiah	26	8	Jeremiah finished speaking everything the Lord had commanded him to say to the people . Then the priests , the prophets , and all the people grabbed Jeremiah . They said , “ You will die for saying such terrible things !
ERV	Jeremiah	26	9	How dare you say such a thing in the name of the Lord ! How dare you say that this Temple will be destroyed like the one at Shiloh ! How dare you say that Jerusalem will become a desert with no one living in it ! ” All the people gathered around Jeremiah in the Temple of the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	10	Now the rulers of Judah heard about everything that was happening . So they came out of the king ’ s palace . They went up to the Lord ’ s Temple . They took their places at the entrance of the New Gate . The New Gate is a gate leading to the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	11	Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and all the other people . They said , “ Jeremiah should be killed . He said bad things about Jerusalem . You heard him say those things. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the rulers of Judah and all the other people . He said , “ The Lord sent me to say these things about this Temple and this city . Everything that you have heard is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	13	You people , change your lives ! You must start doing good ! You must obey the Lord your God . If you do that , he will change his mind . He will not do the bad things he told you about .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , I am in your power . Do to me what you think is good and right .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	15	But if you kill me , be sure of one thing . You will be guilty of killing an innocent person . You will make this city and everyone living in it guilty too . The Lord really did send me to you . The message you heard really is from the Lord. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	26	16	Then the rulers and all the people spoke . They said to the priests and the prophets , “ Jeremiah must not be killed . What he told us comes from the Lord our God. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	26	17	Then some of the elders stood up and spoke to all the people .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	18	They said , “ Micah the prophet was from the city of Moresheth . He was a prophet during the time that Hezekiah was king of Judah . Micah said this to all the people of Judah : ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : Zion will be destroyed . It will become a plowed field . Jerusalem will become a pile of rocks . Temple Mount will be an empty hill [ c ] overgrown with bushes. ’ ( A )
ERV	Jeremiah	26	19	“ King Hezekiah of Judah and the people of Judah did not kill Micah . You know that Hezekiah respected the Lord and wanted to please him . So the Lord changed his mind and didn ’ t do the bad things to Judah that he said he would do . If we hurt Jeremiah , we will bring many troubles on ourselves . And those troubles will be our own fault. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	26	20	In the past there was another man who spoke the Lord ’ s message . His name was Uriah son of Shemaiah from the city of Kiriath Jearim . Uriah said the same things against this city and this land that Jeremiah did .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	21	King Jehoiakim , his army officers , and the leaders of Judah heard Uriah and became angry . King Jehoiakim wanted to kill Uriah , but Uriah heard about it . Uriah was afraid , so he escaped to the land of Egypt .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	22	But King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor and some other men to Egypt .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	23	They brought Uriah from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim . Jehoiakim ordered Uriah to be killed with a sword . Uriah ’ s body was thrown into the burial place where the poor are buried .
ERV	Jeremiah	26	24	There was an important man named Ahikam son of Shaphan who supported Jeremiah . He kept Jeremiah from being killed by the priests and prophets . Footnotes - Jeremiah 26:1 the first year … Jehoiakim This was

ERV	Jeremiah	26	1	Sam .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	27	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came during the fourth year that Zedekiah [ a ] son of Josiah was king of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	2	This is what the Lord said to me : “ Jeremiah , make a yoke out of straps and poles . Put that yoke on the back of your neck .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	3	talks about Zedekiah , and 28:1 says “ that same year ” was the fourth year of Zedekiah ’ s reign ( 594–593 B.C. ) . - Jeremiah 27:19 pillars … other things For a description of these things , see
ERV	Jeremiah	27	4	Tell them to give the message to their masters . Tell them that this is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Tell your masters that
ERV	Jeremiah	27	5	I made the earth and all the people on it . I made all the animals on the earth . I did this with my great power and my strong arm . I can give the earth to anyone I want .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	6	Now I have given all your countries to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . He is my servant . I will make even the wild animals obey him .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	7	All nations will serve Nebuchadnezzar and his son and his grandson . Then the time will come for Babylon to be defeated . Many nations and great kings will make Babylon their servant .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	8	“ ‘ But if some nations or kingdoms refuse to serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and refuse to be put under his control , I will punish them , says the Lord . I will destroy them with war , hunger , and disease . I will use Nebuchadnezzar to destroy any nation that fights against him .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	9	So don ’ t listen to your prophets . Don ’ t listen to those who use magic to tell what will happen in the future . Don ’ t listen to those who say they can interpret dreams . Don ’ t listen to those who talk to the dead or to people who practice magic . All of them tell you , “ You will not be slaves to the king of Babylon. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	27	10	But they are telling you lies . They will only cause you to be taken far from your homeland . I will force you to leave your homes , and you will die in another land .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	11	“ ‘ But the nations that put their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and obey him will live . I will let them stay in their own country and serve the king of Babylon , ’ says the Lord . ‘ The people from those nations will live in their own land and farm it. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	27	12	I gave the same message to King Zedekiah of Judah . I said , “ Zedekiah , you must place your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and obey him . If you serve the king of Babylon and his people , you will live .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	13	If you don ’ t agree to serve the king of Babylon , you and your people will die from war , hunger , and disease . This is what the Lord said would happen .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	14	But the false prophets are saying , ‘ You will never be slaves to the king of Babylon. ’ “ Don ’ t listen to those prophets , because they are telling you lies .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	15	‘ I didn ’ t send them , ’ says the Lord . ‘ They are telling lies and saying that the message is from me . So I will send you people of Judah away . You will die , and the prophets who spoke to you will die also. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	27	16	Then I told the priests and all the people that this is what the Lord says : “ Those false prophets are saying , ‘ The Babylonians took many things from the Lord ’ s Temple . These things will be brought back soon. ’ Don ’ t listen to them because they are telling you lies .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	17	Don ’ t listen to those prophets . Serve the king of Babylon . Accept your punishment , and you will live . There is no reason for you to cause this city of Jerusalem to be destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	18	If they are prophets and their message is from the Lord , let them pray . Let them pray to the Lord about the things that are still in the Lord ’ s Temple , in the king ’ s palace , and in Jerusalem . Let them pray that all those things will not be taken away to Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	19	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says about the things that are still left in Jerusalem . In the Temple , there are the pillars , the bronze sea , the moveable stands , and other things . [ b ] King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon left those things in Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	20	He didn ’ t take them away when he took Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah away as a prisoner . Nebuchadnezzar also took other important people away from Judah and Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	27	21	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says about the things still left in the Lord ’ s Temple and in the king ’ s palace and in Jerusalem :
ERV	Jeremiah	27	22	‘ All those things will also be taken to Babylon . They will be brought to Babylon until the day comes when I go to get them , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Then I will bring those things back . I will put them back in this place. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 27:1 the fourth year … Zedekiah The standard Hebrew text has “ At the beginning of the kingship of Jehoiakim. ” This is probably a scribal error . Verse
ERV	Jeremiah	27	1	Kings 7:23-37 .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	28	In the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah [ a ] was king of Judah , the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur spoke to me . Hananiah was from the town of Gibeon . Hananiah was in the Lord ’ s Temple when he spoke to me . The priests and all the people were there also . This is what Hananiah said :
ERV	Jeremiah	28	2	“ The Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ I will break the yoke that the king of Babylon has put on the people of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	3	Before two years are over , I will bring back all the things that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took from the Lord ’ s Temple . Nebuchadnezzar has carried those things to Babylon . But I will bring them back here to Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	4	I will also bring the king of Judah , Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim , back to this place . And I will bring back all the people of Judah that Nebuchadnezzar forced to leave their homes and go to Babylon , ’ says the Lord . ‘ So I will break the yoke that the king of Babylon put on the people of Judah. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	28	5	Then the prophet Jeremiah answered the prophet Hananiah . They were standing in the Temple of the Lord . The priests and all the people there could hear Jeremiah ’ s answer .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	6	Jeremiah said to Hananiah , “ Amen ! May the Lord do that . May the Lord make the message you say come true . May he bring the things of the Lord ’ s Temple back to this place from Babylon . And may he bring all those who were forced to leave their homes back to this place .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	7	“ But listen to what I have to say to you and to all the people .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	8	There were prophets long before you and I became prophets , Hananiah . They spoke against many countries and great kingdoms and always warned that war , hunger , and disease would come to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	9	So the prophet who says that we will have peace must be tested . People can know that he really was sent by the Lord only if his message comes true. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	28	10	Jeremiah was wearing a yoke around his neck . The prophet Hananiah took the yoke from Jeremiah ’ s neck and broke it .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	11	Then Hananiah spoke loudly so that all the people could hear him . He said , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ In the same way , I will break the yoke of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . He put that yoke on all the nations of the world , but I will break it before two years are over. ’ ” After Hananiah said that , Jeremiah left the Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	12	Then the message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . This happened after Hananiah had taken the yoke off Jeremiah ’ s neck and had broken it .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	13	The Lord said to Jeremiah , “ Go and tell Hananiah that this is what the Lord says : ‘ You have broken a wooden yoke , but I will make a yoke of iron in the place of the wooden yoke .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	14	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , is the one saying this . I will put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations . I will do that to make them serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon , and they will be slaves to him . I will even give Nebuchadnezzar control over the wild animals. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	28	15	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah , “ Listen , Hananiah ! The Lord did not send you . But you have made the people of Judah trust in lies .
ERV	Jeremiah	28	16	So this is what the Lord says : ‘ Soon I will take you from this world , Hananiah . You will die this year , because you taught the people to turn against the Lord. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	28	17	Hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year . Footnotes - Jeremiah 28:1 the fourth year … Zedekiah This was about 594–593 B.C .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	29	Zephaniah the priest read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	2	( This letter was sent after King Jehoiachin , the queen mother , the officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the carpenters , and the metalworkers had been taken from Jerusalem . )
ERV	Jeremiah	29	3	King Zedekiah of Judah sent Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah to King Nebuchadnezzar . Jeremiah gave them the letter to take to Babylon . This is what the letter said :
ERV	Jeremiah	29	4	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says to all the people he sent into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon :
ERV	Jeremiah	29	5	“ Build houses and live in them . Settle in the land . Plant gardens and eat the food you grow .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	6	Get married and have sons and daughters . Find wives for your sons , and let your daughters be married . Do this so that they also may have sons and daughters . Have many children and grow in number in Babylon . Don ’ t become fewer in number .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	7	Also , do good things for the city I sent you to . Pray to the Lord for the city you are living in , because if there is peace in that city , you will have peace also. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	29	8	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says , “ Don ’ t let your prophets and those who practice magic fool you . Don ’ t listen to the dreams they have .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	9	They are telling lies , and they are saying that their message is from me . But I didn ’ t send it. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	10	This is what the Lord says : “ Babylon will be powerful for
ERV	Jeremiah	29	70	years . After that time , I will come to you people who are living in Babylon . I will keep my good promise to bring you back to Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	11	I say this because I know the plans that I have for you. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I have good plans for you . I don ’ t plan to hurt you . I plan to give you hope and a good future .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	12	Then you will call my name . You will come to me and pray to me , and I will listen to you .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	13	You will search for me , and when you search for me with all your heart , you will find me .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	14	I will let you find me. ” This message is from the Lord . “ And I will bring you back from your captivity . I forced you to leave this place . But I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have sent you , ” says the Lord , “ and I will bring you back to this place. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	29	15	You people might say , “ But the Lord has given us prophets here in Babylon. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	29	16	But this is what the Lord says about your relatives who were not carried away to Babylon . I am talking about the king who is sitting on David ’ s throne now and all the other people who are still in the city of Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	17	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ I will soon bring war , hunger , and disease against those who are still in Jerusalem . And I will make them the same as bad figs that are too rotten to eat .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	18	I will attack those who are still in Jerusalem with war , hunger , and disease . And I will cause such pain that all the kingdoms of the earth will be frightened at what has happened to those people . They will be destroyed . People will whistle with amazement when they hear what happened . And people will use them as an example when they ask for bad things to happen to people . People will insult them wherever I force them to go .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	19	I will make all these things happen because the people of Jerusalem have not listened to my message. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I sent my message to them again and again . I used my servants , the prophets , to give my messages to them , but they didn ’ t listen. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	20	“ You people are captives . I forced you to leave Jerusalem and go to Babylon . So listen to the message from the Lord. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	29	21	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah : “ These two men have been telling you lies . They have said that their message is from me . I will give these two prophets to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . And he will kill them in front of all you who are captives in Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	22	They will be an example of a terrible way to die . Yes , in the future , when the Jewish captives want something bad to happen to someone , they will say this curse : ‘ May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab , those men the king of Babylon burned in the fire ! ’
ERV	Jeremiah	29	23	They did very bad things among the people of Israel . They committed the sin of adultery with their neighbors ’ wives . They also spoke lies and said those lies were a message from me . I did not tell them to do that . I know what they have done . I am a witness. ” This message is from the Lord . God ’ s Message to Shemaiah
ERV	Jeremiah	29	24	Also give a message to Shemaiah from the Nehelam family .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	25	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ Shemaiah , you sent letters to all the people in Jerusalem and to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah . You also sent letters to all the priests . You sent those letters in your own name and not by my authority .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	26	Shemaiah , this is what you said in your letter to Zephaniah : ‘ Zephaniah , the Lord has made you priest in place of Jehoiada . You are to be in charge of the Lord ’ s Temple . You should arrest anyone who acts like a crazy person [ a ] and acts like a prophet . You should put that person ’ s feet between large blocks of wood and put neck irons [ b ] on him .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	27	Now Jeremiah is acting like a prophet . So why didn ’ t you arrest him ?
ERV	Jeremiah	29	28	Jeremiah has sent this message to us in Babylon : You people in Babylon will be there for a long time , so build houses and settle down . Plant gardens and eat what you grow. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	29	30	Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ERV	Jeremiah	29	31	“ Jeremiah , send this message to all the captives in Babylon : ‘ This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah , the man from the Nehelam family : Shemaiah has spoken to you , but I didn ’ t send him . He has made you believe a lie .
ERV	Jeremiah	29	32	Because Shemaiah has done that , this is what the Lord says : I will soon punish Shemaiah , the man from the Nehelam family . I will completely destroy his family , and he will not share in the good things I will do for my people. ’ ” This message is from the Lord . “ ‘ I will punish Shemaiah because he has taught the people to turn against the Lord. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 29:26 crazy person Here , Shemaiah is referring to Jeremiah . See verses 27-28 . - Jeremiah 29:26 neck irons A ring made from iron . People put the rings around prisoners , necks . They often fastened a chain to the ring to control the prisoners .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	30	This is the message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	2	The Lord , the God of the people of Israel , said , “ Jeremiah , write in a book the words I have spoken to you . Write this book for yourself .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	3	Do this because the days will come ” —this message is from the Lord— “ when I will bring my people , Israel and Judah , back from exile. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I will put the people back in the land that I gave to their ancestors . Then my people will own that land again. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	30	4	The Lord spoke this message about the people of Israel and Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	5	This is what the Lord said : “ We hear people crying from fear . There is fear , not peace .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	6	“ Ask this question and consider it : Can a man have a baby ? Of course not ! Then why do I see every strong man holding his stomach like a woman having labor pains ? Why is everyone ’ s face turning white like a dead man ?
ERV	Jeremiah	30	7	“ This is a very important time for Jacob . This is a time of great trouble . There will never be another time like this , but Jacob will be saved .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	8	“ At that time , ” says the Lord All-Powerful , “ I will break the yoke from the necks of the people of Israel and Judah , and I will break the ropes holding you . People from foreign countries will never again force my people to be slaves .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	9	The people of Israel and Judah will not serve foreign countries . No , they will serve the Lord their God . I will send them David their king , [ a ] and they will serve him .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	10	“ So Jacob , my servant , don ’ t be afraid ! ” This message is from the Lord . “ Israel , don ’ t be afraid . I will save you from that faraway place . You are captives [ b ] in that faraway land , but I will save your descendants . I will bring them back from that land . Jacob will have peace again . People will not bother Jacob . There will be no enemy to frighten my people .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	11	People of Israel and Judah , I am with you. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I will save you . I sent you to those nations , but I will completely destroy all of them . It is true ; I will destroy those nations , but I will not destroy you . You must be punished for the bad things you did , but I will discipline you fairly. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	30	12	This is what the Lord says : “ You people of Israel and Judah have a wound that can not be cured . You have an injury that will not heal .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	13	There is no one to care for your sores , so you will not be healed .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	14	You became friends with many nations , but those nations don ’ t care about you . Your ‘ friends ’ have forgotten you . I hurt you like an enemy . I punished you very hard . I did this because of your great guilt . I did this because of your many sins .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	15	Israel and Judah , why are you still crying about your wound ? There is no cure for it . I did this to you because of your great guilt . I did this because of your many sins .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	16	Those nations destroyed you , but now they have been destroyed . Israel and Judah , your enemies will become captives . They stole things from you , but others will steal from them . They took things from you in war , but others will take things from them in war .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	17	And I will bring your health back and heal your wounds , ” says the Lord , “ because other people said you were outcasts . [ c ] They said , ‘ No one cares about Zion. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	30	18	This is what the Lord says : “ Jacob ’ s people are now in captivity , but they will come back . And I will have pity on Jacob ’ s houses . The city [ d ] is now only an empty hill covered with ruined buildings , but the city will be rebuilt on its hill . And the king ’ s palace will be rebuilt where it should be .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	19	People in those places will sing songs of praise , and there will be the sound of laughter . I will give them many children . Israel and Judah will not be small . I will bring honor to them . No one will look down on them .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	20	Jacob ’ s family will be like the family of Israel long ago . I will make Israel and Judah strong , and I will punish those who hurt them. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	30	21	The Lord says , “ One of their own people will lead them . That ruler will come from my people . People can come close to me only if I ask them to . So I will ask that leader to come to me , and he will be close to me .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	22	You will be my people , and I will be your God. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	30	23	The Lord was very angry ! He punished the people . The punishment came like a storm . It came like a tornado against those wicked people .
ERV	Jeremiah	30	24	The Lord will be angry until he is through punishing them . He will be angry until he finishes the punishment he planned . When that day comes , you people of Judah will understand . Footnotes - Jeremiah 30:9 David their king This means another king of Israel who will be great like King David . - Jeremiah 30:10 captives People taken away as prisoners .

ERV	Jeremiah	31	5	You farmers of Israel will plant vineyards again . You will plant the vineyards on the hills around the city of Samaria . The farmers will enjoy the fruit from the vineyards .

ERV	Jeremiah	31	8	Remember , I will bring Israel from that country in the north . I will gather the people of Israel from the faraway places on earth . Some of the people will be blind and crippled . Some of the women will be pregnant and ready to give birth . But many people will come back .

ERV	Jeremiah	31	13	Then the young women of Israel will be happy and dance . And the men , young and old , will join in the dancing . I will change their sadness into happiness . I will comfort my people , making them happy instead of sad .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	14	I will give the priests plenty of food . And my people will be filled and satisfied with the good things I give them. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	15	This is what the Lord says : “ A sound is heard in Ramah— bitter crying and great sadness . Rachel [ d ] cries for her children , and she refuses to be comforted , because her children are gone. ”

ERV	Jeremiah	31	19	I wandered away from you . But I finally realized how wrong I was . So I changed my heart and life . I am ashamed and embarrassed about the foolish things I did when I was young. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	31	20	The Lord says , “ You know that Ephraim is my dear son . I love that child . Yes , I often criticized Ephraim , but I still think about him . I love him very much , and I really do want to comfort him .

ERV	Jeremiah	31	22	Unfaithful daughter , how long will you wander around ? “ The Lord has created something new in the land : A woman surrounding a man . [ e ] ”
ERV	Jeremiah	31	23	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : “ I will again do good things for the people of Judah . I will bring back those who were taken away as prisoners . At that time the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words : ‘ May the Lord bless you , good home and holy mountain [ f ] ! ’
ERV	Jeremiah	31	24	“ People in all the towns of Judah will live together in peace . Farmers and those who move around with their flocks will live peacefully together in Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	25	I will give rest and strength to those who are weak and tired. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	31	26	After hearing that , I , Jeremiah , woke up and looked around . My sleep was very pleasant .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	27	“ The days are coming , ” says the Lord , “ when I will help the family of Israel and Judah to grow . I will help their children and animals to grow too . It will be like planting and caring for a plant .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	28	In the past I watched over Israel and Judah , but I watched for the time to pull them up . I tore them down . I destroyed them . I gave many troubles to them . But now I will watch over them to build them up and make them strong. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	29	“ People will not use this saying anymore : ‘ The parents ate the sour grapes , but the children got the sour taste. ’ [ g ]
ERV	Jeremiah	31	30	No , people will die for their own sins . Those who eat sour grapes will get the sour taste. ” The New Agreement
ERV	Jeremiah	31	32	It will not be like the agreement I made with their ancestors . I made that agreement when I took them by the hand and brought them out of Egypt . I was their master , but they broke that agreement. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	33	“ In the future I will make this agreement with the people of Israel. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I will put my teachings in their minds , and I will write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	34	People will not have to teach their neighbors and relatives to know the Lord , because all people , from the least important to the most important , will know me. ” This message is from the Lord . “ I will forgive them for the evil things they did . I will not remember their sins. ” The Lord Will Never Leave Israel
ERV	Jeremiah	31	35	He makes the sun shine in the day , and he makes the moon and the stars shine at night . He stirs up the sea so that its waves crash on the shore . The Lord All-Powerful is his name . This is what the Lord says :
ERV	Jeremiah	31	36	“ The descendants of Israel will never stop being a nation . That would happen only if I lost control of the sun , moon , stars , and sea. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	31	37	The Lord says , “ I will never reject the descendants of Israel . That would happen only if people could measure the sky above , and learn all the secrets of the earth below . Only then would I reject them for the bad things they have done. ” This message is from the Lord . The New Jerusalem
ERV	Jeremiah	31	38	This message is from the Lord , “ The days are coming when the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt for the Lord . The whole city will be rebuilt—from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	39	The measuring line [ h ] will stretch from the Corner Gate straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to the place named Goah .
ERV	Jeremiah	31	40	The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown and all the terraces down to the bottom of Kidron Valley all the way to the corner of Horse Gate will be holy to the Lord . The city of Jerusalem will never again be torn down or destroyed. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 31:6 watchmen This usually means a guard who stands on the city walls watching for people coming to the city . Here , it probably means the prophets . - Jeremiah 31:6 hill country of Ephraim This was the central part of the land that had been the northern kingdom of Israel . - Jeremiah 31:7 Lord , save your people Or “ Lord has saved his people ! ” This is often a shout of victory . - Jeremiah 31:15 Rachel Jacob ’ s wife . Here , this means all the women who are crying for their husbands and children who have died in the war with Babylon . - Jeremiah 31:22 A woman surrounding a man The Hebrew text here is hard to understand . It might be part of some saying that was familiar to the people in Jeremiah ’ s time . - Jeremiah 31:23 good home and holy mountain This was a blessing for the Temple and for Mount Zion , the mountain the Temple was built on . - Jeremiah 31:29 The parents … sour taste This means the children were suffering for things their parents did . - Jeremiah 31:39 measuring line A rope or chain for measuring property lines .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	32	I will destroy Jerusalem because of all the evil things the people of Israel and Judah have done . The people , their kings , leaders , their priests and prophets , the people of Judah , and the people of Jerusalem have all made me angry .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	2	At that time the army of the king of Babylon was surrounding the city of Jerusalem , and Jeremiah was under arrest in the courtyard of the guard . This courtyard was at the palace of the king of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	3	King Zedekiah of Judah had put Jeremiah in prison in that place . Zedekiah didn ’ t like the things Jeremiah prophesied . Jeremiah had said , “ This is what the Lord says : ‘ I will soon give the city of Jerusalem to the king of Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar will capture this city .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	4	King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the army of the Babylonians . But he will surely be given to the king of Babylon . And Zedekiah will speak to the king of Babylon face to face . He will see him with his own eyes .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	5	The king of Babylon will take Zedekiah to Babylon . Zedekiah will stay there until I have punished him. ’ This message is from the Lord . ‘ If you fight against the army of the Babylonians , you will not succeed. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	32	6	While Jeremiah was a prisoner , he said , “ This message from the Lord came to me . This was the message :
ERV	Jeremiah	32	7	‘ Jeremiah , your cousin , Hanamel , will come to you soon . He is the son of your uncle Shallum . Hanamel will say to you , “ Jeremiah , buy my field near the town of Anathoth . Buy it because you are my nearest relative . It is your right and your responsibility to buy that field. ” ’
ERV	Jeremiah	32	8	“ Then it happened just as the Lord said . My cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard . Hanamel said to me , ‘ Jeremiah , buy my field near the town of Anathoth , in the land of the tribe of Benjamin . Buy that land for yourself because it is your right to buy it and own it. ’ ” So I knew that this was a message from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	9	I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel . I weighed out
ERV	Jeremiah	32	17	“ Lord God , with your great power you made the earth and the sky . There is nothing too hard for you to do .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed the deed and had a copy of the deed sealed up . [ c ] I got some men to witness what I had done , and I weighed out the silver on the scales .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	11	Then I took the sealed copy of the deed , which contained the demands and limits of my purchase , and the copy that was not sealed .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	12	I gave the deed to Baruch son of Neriah , the son of Mahseiah . I did this while my cousin Hanamel and the other witnesses were there . They also signed the deed . There were also many people of Judah sitting in the courtyard who saw me give the deed to Baruch .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	13	With all the people watching , I said to Baruch ,
ERV	Jeremiah	32	14	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Take both copies of the deed—the sealed copy and the copy that was not sealed—and put them in a clay jar . Do this so that these deeds will last a long time. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	32	15	The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says , ‘ In the future my people will once again buy houses , fields , and vineyards in the land of Israel. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	32	16	After I gave the deed to Baruch son of Neriah , I prayed to the Lord :
ERV	Jeremiah	32	18	You are loyal and kind to thousands of people , but you also bring punishment to children for their fathers ’ sins . Great and powerful God , your name is the Lord All-Powerful .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	19	You plan and do great things . You see everything that people do . You give a reward to those who do good things , and you punish those who do bad things—you give them what they deserve .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	20	You have been doing powerful miracles in the land of Egypt until now , in Israel and elsewhere . You are the one who made yourself as famous as you are today .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	21	You used powerful miracles and brought your people Israel out of Egypt . You used your own powerful hand to do this . Your power was amazing !
ERV	Jeremiah	32	22	“ You gave the Israelites this land that you promised to give to their ancestors long ago . It is a very good land filled with many good things .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	23	They came into this land and took it for their own . But they didn ’ t obey you . They didn ’ t follow your teachings or do what you commanded . So you made all these terrible things happen to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	24	“ And now the enemy has surrounded the city . They are building ramps so that they can get over the walls of Jerusalem and capture it . Because of war , hunger , and disease , the city of Jerusalem will fall to the Babylonian army . The Babylonians are attacking the city now . You said this would happen , and now you see it is happening .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	25	“ Lord God , all those bad things are happening . But now you are telling me , ‘ Jeremiah , buy the field with silver and choose some men to witness the purchase. ’ You are telling me this while the Babylonian army is ready to capture the city . Why should I waste my money like that ? ”
ERV	Jeremiah	32	26	Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ERV	Jeremiah	32	27	“ Jeremiah , I am the Lord . I am the God of every person on the earth . You know that nothing is impossible for me. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	32	28	The Lord also said , “ I will soon give the city of Jerusalem to the Babylonian army and to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . The army will capture the city .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	29	The Babylonian army is already attacking the city of Jerusalem . They will soon enter the city and start a fire . They will burn down this city . There are houses in this city where the people of Jerusalem made me angry by offering sacrifices to the false god Baal on the housetops . And they poured out drink offerings to other idol gods . The Babylonian army will burn down those houses .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	30	I have watched the people of Israel and the people of Judah . Everything they do is evil . They have done evil things since they were young . The people of Israel have made me very angry because they worship idols that they made with their own hands. ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	31	“ From the time that Jerusalem was built until now , the people of this city have made me angry . This city has made me very angry , so I must remove it from my sight .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	33	“ They should have come to me for help , but they turned their backs to me . I tried to teach them again and again , but they would not listen to me . I tried to correct them , but they would not listen .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	34	They have made their idols , and I hate those idols . They put their idols in the Temple that is called by my name , so they made my Temple ‘ dirty. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	32	35	“ In the Valley of Ben Hinnom , [ d ] they built high places to the false god Baal . They built those worship places so that they could burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices . I never commanded them to do such a terrible thing . I never even thought the people of Judah would do such a terrible thing .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	36	“ You people are saying , ‘ The king of Babylon will capture Jerusalem . He will use war , hunger , and disease to defeat this city. ’ But this is what the Lord , the God of the people of Israel , says :
ERV	Jeremiah	32	37	‘ I have forced the people of Israel and Judah to leave their land . I was very angry with them , but I will bring them back to this place . I will gather them from the land where I forced them to go . I will bring them back to this place . I will let them live in peace and safety .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	38	The people of Israel and Judah will be my people , and I will be their God .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	39	I will give them the desire to be one , united people . They will have one goal—to worship me all their lives . They and their children will want to do this .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	40	“ ‘ I will make an agreement with the people of Israel and Judah that will last forever . In this agreement I will never turn away from them . I will always be good to them . I will make them want to respect me . Then they will never turn away from me .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	41	They will make me happy . I will enjoy doing good to them . And I will surely plant them in this land and make them grow . I will do this with all my heart and soul. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	32	42	This is what the Lord says : “ I have brought this great disaster to the people of Israel and Judah . In the same way I will bring good things to them . I promise to do good things for them .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	43	You people are saying , ‘ This land is an empty desert . There are no people or animals here . The Babylonian army defeated this country. ’ But in the future people will once again buy fields in this land .
ERV	Jeremiah	32	44	They will use their money and buy fields . They will sign and seal their agreements . They will witness the people signing their deeds . They will again buy fields in the land where the tribe of Benjamin lives , in the area around Jerusalem , in the towns of the land of Judah , in the hill country , in the western foothills , and in the area of the southern desert . This will happen because I will bring them back home. ” This message is from the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 32:1 the tenth year … Judah This was 588–587 B.C . This was the year Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar . - Jeremiah 32:9 shekel 2/5 of an ounce ( 11.5 g ) . - Jeremiah 32:10 sealed up Important documents were rolled up and tied with a string . Then a piece of clay or wax was put on the string . Then a person ’ s mark was put in that clay or wax . This way , people could prove nothing in the document was changed . - Jeremiah 32:35 Valley of Ben Hinnom This valley is also called “ Gehenna. ” This name comes from the Hebrew name “ Ge Hinnom—Hinnom ’ s Valley. ” This place became an example of how God punishes wicked people .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	33	While Jeremiah was still locked up in the courtyard of the guards , the message from the Lord came to him a second time :
ERV	Jeremiah	33	2	“ The Lord made the earth , and he keeps it safe . The Lord is his name . He says ,
ERV	Jeremiah	33	3	‘ Judah , pray to me , and I will answer you . I will tell you important secrets . You have never heard these things before. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	33	4	The Lord is the God of Israel . This is what he says about the houses in Jerusalem and about the palaces of the kings of Judah : ‘ The enemy will pull these houses down . They will build ramps up to the top of the city walls . They will use swords and fight the people in these cities .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	5	“ ‘ The people in Jerusalem have done many bad things . I am angry with them . I have turned against them , so I will kill many people there . The Babylonian army will come to fight against Jerusalem . There will be many dead bodies in the houses in Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	6	“ ‘ But then I will heal the people in that city . I will let them enjoy peace and safety .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	7	I will make good things happen to Judah and Israel again and make them strong as in the past .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	8	They sinned against me , but I will wash away that sin . They fought against me , but I will forgive them .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	9	Then Jerusalem will be a wonderful place . The people will be happy . People from other nations will praise it when they hear about the good things happening there . They will hear about the good things I am doing for Jerusalem. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	33	10	“ This is what the Lord says : ‘ You people say that your country is an empty desert . There are no people or animals living there. ’ It is now quiet in the streets of Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah . But it will be noisy there soon .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	11	There will be sounds of joy and happiness . There will be the happy sounds of a bride and groom . There will be the sounds of people bringing their gifts to the Lord ’ s Temple . They will say , ‘ Praise the Lord All-Powerful ! The Lord is good ! His faithful love will last forever ! ’ They will say this because I will again do good things to Judah . It will be as it was in the beginning. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	12	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ This place is empty now . There are no people or animals living here . But there will be people in all the towns of Judah . There will be shepherds , and there will be pastures where they will let their flocks rest .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	13	Shepherds will count their sheep as the sheep walk in front of them . They will be counting their sheep all around the country—in the hill country , in the western foothills , in the Negev , and in all the other towns of Judah. ” The Good Branch
ERV	Jeremiah	33	14	This message is from the Lord : “ I made a special promise to the people of Israel and Judah . The time is coming when I will do what I promised .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	15	At that time I will make a good ‘ branch ’ grow from David ’ s family . That branch will do what is good and right for the country .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	16	When he rules , Judah will be saved . The people of Jerusalem will live in safety . This will be his name : ‘ The Lord Makes Things Right For Us. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	33	17	The Lord says , “ Someone from David ’ s family will always sit on the throne and rule the family of Israel .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	18	And there will always be priests from the family of Levi . They will always stand before me and offer burnt offerings and sacrifice grain offerings and give sacrifices to me. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	33	19	This message from the Lord came to Jeremiah .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	20	The Lord says , “ I have an agreement with day and night . I agreed that they would continue forever . You can not change that agreement . Day and night will always come at the right time . If you could change that agreement ,
ERV	Jeremiah	33	21	then you could change my agreement with David and Levi . Then descendants from David would not be the kings , and the family of Levi would not be priests .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	22	But I will give many descendants to my servant David and to the tribe of Levi . They will be as many as the stars in the sky—no one can count all the stars . And they will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore—no one can count the grains of sand. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	33	23	Jeremiah received this message from the Lord :
ERV	Jeremiah	33	24	“ Jeremiah , have you heard what the people are saying ? They are saying , ‘ The Lord turned away from the two families of Israel and Judah . He chose those people , but now he does not even accept them as a nation. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	33	25	The Lord says , “ If my agreement with day and night does not continue , and if I had not made the laws for the sky and earth , maybe I would leave those people .
ERV	Jeremiah	33	26	Then maybe I would turn away from Jacob ’ s descendants . And then maybe I would not let David ’ s descendants rule over the descendants of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . But David is my servant , and I will be kind to those people . I will again cause good things to happen to them . ”
ERV	Jeremiah	34	34	The message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . The message came at the time when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and all the towns around it . Nebuchadnezzar had with him all his army and the armies of all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	2	This was the message : “ This is what the Lord , the God of the people of Israel , says : Jeremiah , go to King Zedekiah of Judah and give him this message : ‘ Zedekiah , this is what the Lord says : I will give the city of Jerusalem to the king of Babylon very soon , and he will burn it down .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	3	Zedekiah , you will not escape from the king of Babylon . You will surely be caught and given to him . You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes . He will talk to you face to face , and you will go to Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	4	But listen to the promise of the Lord , King Zedekiah of Judah . This is what the Lord says about you : You will not be killed with a sword .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	5	You will die in a peaceful way . People made funeral fires to honor your ancestors , the kings who ruled before you became king . In the same way people will make a funeral fire to honor you . They will cry for you and sadly say , “ Oh , my master ! ” I myself make this promise to you. ’ ” This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	6	So Jeremiah told all this message to Zedekiah in Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	7	This was while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem . The army of Babylon was also fighting against the cities of Judah that had not been captured . These cities were Lachish and Azekah . These were the only fortified cities left in the land of Judah . The People Break an Agreement
ERV	Jeremiah	34	8	King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem to give freedom to all the Hebrew slaves . A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah after Zedekiah had made that agreement .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	9	Everyone was supposed to free their Hebrew slaves . All male and female Hebrew slaves were to be set free . No one was supposed to keep another person from the tribe of Judah in slavery .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	10	So all the leaders of Judah and all the people accepted this agreement . They would free their male and female slaves so that they would no longer serve them . Everyone agreed , and so all the slaves were set free .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	11	But after that , [ a ] the people who had slaves changed their minds . So they took the people they had set free and made them slaves again .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	12	Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ERV	Jeremiah	34	13	“ This is what the Lord , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt , where they were slaves . When I did that , I made an agreement with them .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	14	I said to your ancestors , “ At the end of every seven years , everyone must set their Hebrew slaves free . If you have fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you , you must let them go free after they have served you for six years. ” But your ancestors did not listen to me or pay attention to me .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	15	. - Jeremiah 34:21 left Jerusalem In the summer of
ERV	Jeremiah	34	16	But now you have changed your minds . You have shown that you do not honor my name because each of you has taken back the male and female slaves that you had set free . You have forced them to become slaves again. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	34	17	“ So this is what the Lord says : ‘ You people have not obeyed me . You have not given freedom to your fellow Hebrews . So , because you have not given them freedom , I will give a special kind of freedom—freedom to die in war or by disease or by hunger ! This message is from the Lord . When the other nations see what I have done to you , they will all be shocked .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	18	I will hand over those who broke my agreement and have not kept the promises they made before me . They cut a calf into two pieces before me and walked between the two pieces . [ b ]
ERV	Jeremiah	34	19	These are the people who walked between the two pieces of the calf when they made the agreement before me : the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the important officials of the court , the priests , and the people of the land .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	20	So I will give them to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them . Their bodies will become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth .
ERV	Jeremiah	34	21	I will give King Zedekiah of Judah and his leaders to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them . I will give Zedekiah and his people to the army of the king of Babylon , even though that army has left Jerusalem . [ c ]
ERV	Jeremiah	34	22	But I will give the order , ’ says the Lord , ‘ to bring the Babylonian army back to Jerusalem . That army will fight against Jerusalem . They will capture it , set it on fire , and burn it down . And I will destroy the towns in the land of Judah . They will become empty deserts . No one will live there. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 34:11 after that In the summer of
ERV	Jeremiah	34	588	B.C. , the Egyptian army came to help the people of Jerusalem . So the Babylonian army had to leave Jerusalem for a short time to fight the Egyptians . See Jer . 37:5 . See also the footnote to Jer . 34:11 .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	35	During the time when Jehoiakim , son of King Josiah , was king of Judah , the Lord spoke this message to Jeremiah :
ERV	Jeremiah	35	2	Kings 10:15-28 for the story of Jonadab . Also in verses
ERV	Jeremiah	35	3	So I went to get Jaazaniah [ b ] son of Jeremiah , [ c ] who was the son of Habazziniah . And I got all of Jaazaniah ’ s brothers and sons and the whole family of the Recabites together .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	4	Then I brought them into the Temple of the Lord . We went into the room of the sons of Hanan , the son of Igdaliah . Hanan was a man of God . [ d ] The room was next to the room where the princes of Judah stay . It was over the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum . Maaseiah was the doorkeeper in the Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I put some bowls full of wine and some cups in front of the Recabite family . And I said to them , “ Drink some wine. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	35	6	,
ERV	Jeremiah	35	7	Also you must never build houses , plant seeds , or plant vineyards . You must never do any of those things . You must live only in tents . If you do that , you will live a long time in the land where you move from place to place. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	35	8	So we have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us . None of us ever drinks wine , and neither do our wives , sons , or daughters .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	9	We never build houses to live in , we never own vineyards or fields , and we never plant crops .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	10	We have lived in tents and have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	11	But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked the country of Judah , we did go into Jerusalem . We said to each other , ‘ Come , we must enter the city of Jerusalem so that we can escape the Babylonian army and the Aramean army. ’ So we have stayed in Jerusalem. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	35	12	Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ERV	Jeremiah	35	13	“ The Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says to go to the people of Judah and Jerusalem and tell them this message : ‘ You should learn a lesson and obey my message. ’ This message is from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	14	‘ Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine , and that command has been obeyed . To this day the descendants of Jonadab have obeyed their ancestor ’ s command . They do not drink wine . But I have given commands to you people of Judah again and again , and you have not obeyed me .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	15	Time after time I have sent my servants the prophets to you . They said , “ You must each stop doing evil things and do what is right . Don ’ t follow other gods . Don ’ t worship or serve them . If you obey me , you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors. ” But you have not paid attention to my message .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	16	The descendants of Jonadab obeyed the commands that their ancestor gave them , but the people of Judah have not obeyed me. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	35	17	“ So this is what the Lord God All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I said that many bad things would happen to Judah and Jerusalem . I will soon make all those bad things happen . I spoke to the people , but they refused to listen . I called out to them , but they didn ’ t answer me. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	35	18	. - Jeremiah 35:3 Jaazaniah He was the head of the Recabite family at that time . - Jeremiah 35:3 Jeremiah This is not the prophet Jeremiah , but a different man with the same name . - Jeremiah 35:4 man of God This is usually an honorable title for a prophet . We know nothing else about Hanan .
ERV	Jeremiah	35	19	So the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ There will always be a descendant of Jonadab son of Recab to serve me. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 35:2 Recabite family A group of people descended from Jonadab son of Recab . The family was very loyal to the Lord . See
ERV	Jeremiah	36	36	The message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . This was during the fourth year that Jehoiakim [ a ] son of Josiah was king of Judah . This was the message from the Lord :
ERV	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Jeremiah , get a scroll and write on it all the messages I have spoken to you . I have spoken to you about the nations of Israel and Judah and all the other nations . Write all the words that I have spoken to you from the time that Josiah was king , until now .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	3	Maybe the people of Judah will hear what I am planning to do to them and will stop doing bad things . If they will do that , I will forgive them for the terrible sins they have committed. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	4	So Jeremiah called a man named Baruch son of Neriah . Jeremiah spoke the messages the Lord had given him . While he spoke , Baruch wrote the messages on the scroll .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	5	Then Jeremiah said to Baruch , “ I can not go to the Lord ’ s Temple . I am not allowed to go there .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	6	So I want you to go to the Temple of the Lord . Go there on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll . Read to the people the messages from the Lord that you wrote on the scroll as I spoke them to you . Read them to all the people of Judah who come into Jerusalem from the towns where they live .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	7	Perhaps they will ask the Lord to help them . Perhaps each person will stop doing bad things . The Lord has announced that he is very angry with them. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	8	So Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do . Baruch read aloud the scroll that had the Lord ’ s messages written on it . He read it in the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	9	In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim was king , a fast was announced . All those who lived in the city of Jerusalem and everyone who had come into Jerusalem from the towns of Judah were supposed to fast before the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	10	At that time Baruch read the scroll that contained Jeremiah ’ s words . He read the scroll in the Temple of the Lord to all the people who were there . Baruch was in the room of Gemariah in the upper courtyard when he read from the scroll . That room was located at the entrance of the New Gate of the Temple . Gemariah was the son of Shaphan . Gemariah was a scribe in the Temple .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	11	A man named Micaiah heard all the messages from the Lord that Baruch read from the scroll . Micaiah was the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	12	When Micaiah heard the messages from the scroll , he went down to the secretary ’ s room in the king ’ s palace . All the royal officials were sitting there in the king ’ s palace . These are the names of the officials : Elishama the secretary , Delaiah son of Shemaiah , Elnathan son of Acbor , Gemariah son of Shaphan , Zedekiah son of Hananiah ; all the other royal officials were there too .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	13	Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read from the scroll .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	14	Then all the officials sent a man named Jehudi to Baruch . ( Jehudi was the son of Nethaniah , son of Shelemiah . Shelemiah was the son of Cushi . ) Jehudi said to Baruch , “ Bring the scroll that you read from and come with me. ” Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went with Jehudi to the officials .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	15	Then the officials said to Baruch , “ Sit down and read the scroll to us. ” So Baruch read the scroll to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	16	When the royal officials heard all the messages from the scroll , they were afraid and looked at one another . They said to Baruch , “ We must tell King Jehoiakim about these messages on the scroll. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	17	Then the officials asked Baruch , “ Tell us , Baruch , where did you get these messages that you wrote on the scroll ? Did you write down what Jeremiah said to you ? ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	18	“ Yes , ” Baruch answered . “ Jeremiah spoke , and I wrote down all the messages with ink on this scroll. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	19	Then the royal officials said to Baruch , “ You and Jeremiah must go and hide . Don ’ t tell anyone where you are hiding. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	20	Then the royal officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe . They went to King Jehoiakim and told him all about the scroll .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	21	So King Jehoiakim sent Jehudi to get the scroll . Jehudi brought the scroll from the room of Elishama the scribe . Then Jehudi read the scroll to the king and all the servants who stood around the king .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	22	The time this happened was in the ninth month , [ b ] so King Jehoiakim was sitting in the part of the palace used for winter . There was a fire burning in a small fireplace in front of the king .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	23	Jehudi began to read from the scroll . But after he would read two or three columns , King Jehoiakim would grab the scroll . Then he would cut those columns off the scroll with a small knife and throw them into the fireplace . Finally , the whole scroll was burned in the fire .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	24	And , when King Jehoiakim and his servants heard the message from the scroll , they were not afraid . They did not tear their clothes to show sorrow for doing wrong .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	25	Elnathan , Delaiah , and Gemariah tried to talk King Jehoiakim out of burning the scroll , but he would not listen to them .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	26	Instead King Jehoiakim commanded some men to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet . These men were Jerahmeel , a son of the king , Seraiah son of Azriel , and Shelemiah son of Abdeel . But they could not find Baruch and Jeremiah , because the Lord had hidden them .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	27	King Jehoiakim burned the scroll on which Baruch had written all the words that Jeremiah had spoken to him . Then this message from the Lord came to Jeremiah :
ERV	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Get another scroll . Write all the messages on it that were on the first scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	29	Also tell King Jehoiakim of Judah that this is what the Lord says : ‘ Jehoiakim , you burned that scroll . You said , “ Why did Jeremiah write that the king of Babylon will surely come and destroy this land and kill all the people and animals in it ? ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	30	So this is what the Lord says about King Jehoiakim of Judah : Jehoiakim ’ s descendants will not sit on David ’ s throne . When Jehoiakim dies , he will not get a king ’ s funeral , but his body will be thrown out on the ground . His body will be left out in the heat of the day and the cold frost of the night .
ERV	Jeremiah	36	31	I will punish Jehoiakim and his children , and I will punish his officials . I will do this because they are wicked . I will bring terrible disasters on them and on all those who live in Jerusalem and on the people from Judah . I will bring all these bad things on them , just as I warned them , because they have not listened to me. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	36	32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah , the scribe . As Jeremiah spoke , Baruch wrote on the scroll the same messages that were on the scroll that King Jehoiakim had burned in the fire . And many other words like those messages were added to the second scroll . Footnotes - Jeremiah 36:1 the fourth year … Jehoiakim This was about
ERV	Jeremiah	36	605	B.C . - Jeremiah 36:22 ninth month That is , November–December .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	37	Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon . He appointed Zedekiah son of Josiah to be the king of Judah in the place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	2	But Zedekiah , his servants , and the people of Judah did not pay attention to the messages the Lord had given to Jeremiah the prophet .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	3	King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with a message . This was the message they brought to Jeremiah : “ Jeremiah , pray to the Lord our God for us. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	37	4	At that time Jeremiah had not yet been put into prison , so he was free to go anywhere he wanted .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	5	Also at that time Pharaoh ’ s army had marched from Egypt toward Judah . The Babylonian army had surrounded the city of Jerusalem in order to defeat it . Then they had heard about the army from Egypt marching toward them . So the army from Babylon left Jerusalem to fight with the army from Egypt .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	6	This message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet :
ERV	Jeremiah	37	7	“ This is what the Lord , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ Jehucal and Zephaniah , I know that King Zedekiah of Judah sent you to me to ask questions . Tell King Zedekiah this : Pharaoh ’ s army marched out of Egypt to come here to help you against the army of Babylon . But Pharaoh ’ s army will go back to Egypt .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	8	After that the army from Babylon will come back here and attack Jerusalem . Then they will capture and burn it. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	37	9	This is what the Lord says : ‘ People of Jerusalem , don ’ t fool yourselves . Don ’ t say to yourselves , “ The army of Babylon will surely leave us alone. ” They will not .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	10	People of Jerusalem , even if you could defeat all the Babylonian army that is attacking you , there would still be a few wounded men left in their tents . Even those few wounded men would come out of their tents and burn Jerusalem down. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	37	11	When the Babylonian army left Jerusalem to fight the army of the Pharaoh of Egypt ,
ERV	Jeremiah	37	12	Jeremiah wanted to travel from Jerusalem to the land of Benjamin . [ a ] He wanted to be there for a division of some property that belonged to his family .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	13	But when Jeremiah got to the Benjamin Gate of Jerusalem , [ b ] the captain in charge of the guards arrested him . The captain ’ s name was Irijah son of Shelemiah . Shelemiah was the son of Hananiah . So Irijah the captain arrested Jeremiah and said , “ Jeremiah , you are leaving us to join the Babylonian side. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	37	14	Jeremiah said to Irijah , “ That is not true ! I am not leaving to join the Babylonians. ” But Irijah refused to listen to Jeremiah . And Irijah arrested Jeremiah and took him to the royal officials of Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	15	Those officials were very angry with Jeremiah . They gave an order for Jeremiah to be beaten . Then they put him in a prison . The prison was in the house of Jonathan , a scribe for the king of Judah . His house had been made into a prison .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	16	They put Jeremiah into a cell under the house of Jonathan . The cell was in a dungeon under the ground . Jeremiah was there for a long time .
ERV	Jeremiah	37	17	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the palace . Zedekiah talked to Jeremiah in private . He asked Jeremiah , “ Is there any message from the Lord ? ” Jeremiah answered , “ Yes , he said that you will be given to the king of Babylon. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	37	18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah , “ What have I done wrong ? What crime have I done against you or your officials or the people of Jerusalem ? Why have you thrown me into prison ?
ERV	Jeremiah	37	19	King Zedekiah , where are your prophets now ? They told you a false message . They said , ‘ The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land of Judah. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	37	20	But now , my lord , king of Judah , please listen to me . Please let me bring my request to you . This is what I ask : Don ’ t send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe . If you send me back , I will die there. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	37	21	So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah to be put under guard in the courtyard . And he ordered that Jeremiah should be given bread from the street bakers . He was given bread until there was no more bread in the city . So Jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard . Footnotes - Jeremiah 37:12 the land of Benjamin Jeremiah was going to his hometown , Anathoth , which was in the land of Benjamin . - Jeremiah 37:13 Benjamin Gate of Jerusalem This gate led out of Jerusalem to the road which went north to the land of Benjamin .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	38	Some of the royal officials heard what Jeremiah was saying . They were Shephatiah son of Mattan , Gedaliah son of Pashhur , Jehucal son of Shelemiah , and Pashhur son of Malkijah . Jeremiah was telling all the people this message :
ERV	Jeremiah	38	2	“ This is what the Lord says : ‘ Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war , hunger , or disease . But everyone who surrenders to the army of Babylon will live and escape with their lives. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	38	3	And this is what the Lord says : ‘ This city of Jerusalem will surely be given to the army of the king of Babylon . He will capture this city. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	4	Then the royal officials who heard what Jeremiah was telling the people went to King Zedekiah . They said to the king , “ Jeremiah should be put to death . He is discouraging the soldiers who are still in the city and everyone else by what he is saying . He is not looking for peace ; he is just trying to cause trouble. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	5	So King Zedekiah said to the officials , “ Jeremiah is in your control . I can not do anything to stop you. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	6	So the officials took Jeremiah and put him into Malkijah ’ s cistern . Malkijah was the king ’ s son . The cistern was in the Temple yard where the king ’ s guard stayed . They used ropes to lower Jeremiah into the cistern . The cistern didn ’ t have any water in it , only mud . And Jeremiah sank down into the mud .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	7	But a man named Ebed Melech heard that the officials had put Jeremiah into the cistern . Ebed Melech was from Ethiopia , and he was a eunuch in the king ’ s palace . King Zedekiah was sitting at the Benjamin Gate , so Ebed Melech left the king ’ s palace and went to talk to the king at the gate . 8-9 Ebed Melech said , “ My lord and king , these officials have done evil . They have treated Jeremiah the prophet badly . They have thrown him into a cistern and left him there to die. ” [ a ]
ERV	Jeremiah	38	10	Then King Zedekiah gave a command to Ebed Melech , the Ethiopian . This was the command : “ Ebed Melech , take three [ b ] men from the palace with you , and go get Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	11	So Ebed Melech took the men with him . But first he went to a room under the storeroom in the king ’ s palace . He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from that room . Then he let the rags down with some ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	12	Ebed Melech , the Ethiopian , said to Jeremiah , “ Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms . When we pull you out , these rags will pad your underarms . Then the ropes will not hurt you. ” So Jeremiah did as Ebed Melech said .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	13	The men pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern . And Jeremiah stayed under guard in the Temple yard . Zedekiah Asks Jeremiah Some Questions
ERV	Jeremiah	38	14	Then King Zedekiah sent someone to get Jeremiah the prophet . He had Jeremiah brought to the third entrance to the Temple of the Lord . Then the king said , “ Jeremiah , I am going to ask you something . Don ’ t hide anything from me , but tell me everything honestly. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ If I give you an answer , you will probably kill me . And even if I give you advice , you will not listen to me. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	16	But King Zedekiah secretly swore an oath to Jeremiah . Zedekiah said , “ As surely as the Lord lives , who gives us breath and life , I will not kill you , Jeremiah . And I promise not to give you to the officials who want to kill you. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	17	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah , “ The Lord God All-Powerful is the God of Israel . This is what he says , ‘ If you surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon , your life will be saved , and Jerusalem will not be burned down . And you and your family will live .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	18	But if you refuse to surrender , Jerusalem will be given to the Babylonian army . They will burn Jerusalem down , and you will not escape from them. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	19	But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ But I am afraid of the men of Judah who have already gone over to the side of the Babylonian army . I am afraid that the soldiers will give me to those men , and they will treat me badly and hurt me. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	20	But Jeremiah answered , “ The soldiers will not give you to the men of Judah . King Zedekiah , obey the Lord by doing what I tell you . Then things will go well for you , and your life will be saved .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	21	But if you refuse to surrender to the army of Babylon , the Lord has shown me what will happen . This is what he has told me :
ERV	Jeremiah	38	22	All the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought out . They will be brought to the important officials of the king of Babylon . Your women will make fun of you with a song . This is what they will say : ‘ Your friends were stronger than you , and they led you the wrong way . You trusted them , but now your feet are stuck in the mud , and your friends have left you. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	38	23	“ All your wives and children will be brought out . They will be given to the Babylonian army . You yourself will not escape from the army of Babylon . You will be captured by the king of Babylon , and Jerusalem will be burned down. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ Don ’ t tell anyone that I have been talking to you . If you do , you might die .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	25	If the officials find out that I talked to you , they will come to you and say , ‘ Jeremiah , tell us what you said to King Zedekiah and what he said to you . Be honest with us , and tell us everything , or we will kill you. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	38	26	If they say this to you , tell them , ‘ I was begging the king not to send me back to the cell in the dungeon under Jonathan ’ s house . If I were to go back there , I would die. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	38	27	It happened that the royal officials of the king did come to Jeremiah to question him . So Jeremiah told them everything the king had ordered him to say . Then they left Jeremiah alone . No one had heard what Jeremiah and the king had talked about .
ERV	Jeremiah	38	28	So Jeremiah stayed under guard in the Temple yard until the day Jerusalem was captured . Footnotes - Jeremiah 38:8 left him there to die Literally , “ he will starve to death because there is no more bread in the city. ” - Jeremiah 38:10 three This is found in one ancient Hebrew copy . Most Hebrew copies have “
ERV	Jeremiah	38	30	. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	39	39	This is how Jerusalem was captured : During the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah , King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army . He surrounded the city to defeat it .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	2	And on the ninth day of the fourth month in Zedekiah ’ s eleventh year , the wall of Jerusalem was broken through .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	3	Then all the royal officials of the king of Babylon came into the city of Jerusalem . They came in and sat down at the Middle Gate . These are the names of the officials : Nergal-Sharezer , the governor of the district of Samgar , a very high official ; Nebo Sarsekim , another very high official ; and various other important officials were there also .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	4	King Zedekiah of Judah saw the officials from Babylon , so he and the soldiers with him ran away . They left Jerusalem at night . They went out through the king ’ s garden and out through the gate that was between the two walls . Then they went toward the desert .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	5	The Babylonian army chased Zedekiah and the soldiers with him . They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho . They captured Zedekiah and took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar was at the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath . At that place Nebuchadnezzar decided what to do to Zedekiah .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	6	There at the town of Riblah , the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah ’ s sons and he killed all the royal officials of Judah while Zedekiah watched .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	7	Then Nebuchadnezzar tore out Zedekiah ’ s eyes . He put bronze chains on Zedekiah and took him to Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	8	The army of Babylon set fire to the king ’ s palace and the houses of the people of Jerusalem . And they broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	9	Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king of Babylon ’ s special guards . He took all the people who had surrendered to him and all the people still in Jerusalem and made them captives . He carried them away to Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	10	But commander Nebuzaradan left behind some of the poor people of Judah who owned nothing . Nebuzaradan gave them vineyards and farmland in Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	11	Nebuchadnezzar also gave an order about Jeremiah to commander Nebuzaradan :
ERV	Jeremiah	39	12	“ Find Jeremiah and take care of him . Don ’ t hurt him . Give him whatever he asks for. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuzaradan , the commander of the king ’ s special guards , Nebushazban , a chief officer in the army of Babylon , Nergal-Sharezer , a high official , and all the other officers of the army of Babylon sent for Jeremiah .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	14	They had Jeremiah taken out of the Temple yard where he had been under the guard of the king of Judah . They turned Jeremiah over to Gedaliah [ a ] son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan . Gedaliah had orders to take Jeremiah back home . So Jeremiah was taken home , and he stayed among his own people . The Lord ’ s Message to Ebed Melech
ERV	Jeremiah	39	15	While the guards were watching Jeremiah in the Temple yard , a message from the Lord came to him . This was the message :
ERV	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Jeremiah , go and tell Ebed Melech [ b ] the Ethiopian this message : ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : Very soon I will make my messages about this city of Jerusalem come true . My messages will come true through disaster , not through something good . You will see everything come true with your own eyes .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	17	But I will save you on that day , Ebed Melech. ’ This is the message from the Lord . ‘ You will not be given to the people you are afraid of .
ERV	Jeremiah	39	18	I will save you , Ebed Melech . You will not die from a sword , but you will escape and live . That will happen because you have trusted in me. ’ ” This message is from the Lord . Footnotes - Jeremiah 39:14 Gedaliah Gedaliah was the man who Nebuchadnezzar appointed as his governor for the land of Judah . - Jeremiah 39:16 Ebed Melech See Jer . 38:7-13 .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	40	The message from the Lord came to Jeremiah after he was set free at the city of Ramah . Nebuzaradan , the commander of the king of Babylon ’ s special guards , found Jeremiah in Ramah . Jeremiah was bound with chains . He was with all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah . They were being taken away in captivity to Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	2	When commander Nebuzaradan found Jeremiah , he spoke to him . He said , “ Jeremiah , the Lord , your God , announced that this disaster would come to this place .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	3	And now the Lord has done everything just as he said he would do . This disaster happened because you people of Judah sinned against the Lord . You did not obey him .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	4	But now , Jeremiah , I will set you free . I am taking the chains off your wrists . If you want to , come with me to Babylon , and I will take good care of you . But if you don ’ t want to come with me , then don ’ t come . Look , the whole country is open to you . Go anywhere you want .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	5	Or go back to Gedaliah [ a ] son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan . The king of Babylon has chosen Gedaliah to be governor over the towns of Judah . Go and live with Gedaliah among the people . Or you can go anywhere you want. ” Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah . He stayed with Gedaliah among those who were left behind in the land of Judah . The Short Rule of Gedaliah
ERV	Jeremiah	40	7	There were some soldiers from the army of Judah , officers and their men , still out in the open country when Jerusalem was destroyed . They heard that the king of Babylon had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam in charge of those who were left in the land . Those who were left were men , women , and children who were very poor . They were not carried off to Babylon as captives .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	8	So the soldiers came to Gedaliah at Mizpah . They were Ishmael son of Nethaniah , Johanan and his brother Jonathan , sons of Kareah , Seraiah son of Tanhumeth , sons of Ephai from Netophah , and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite , and the men who were with them .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	9	Gedaliah son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , made an oath to make the soldiers and their men feel more secure . This is what he said : “ You soldiers , don ’ t be afraid to serve the Babylonian people . Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon . If you do this , things will go well for you .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	10	I myself will live in Mizpah . I will speak for you before the Chaldeans who come here . You leave that work to me . You should harvest the wine , the summer fruit , and the oil . Put what you harvest in your storage jars . Live in the towns that you control. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	40	11	All the people of Judah who were in the countries of Moab , Ammon , Edom , and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left some people of Judah in the land . And they heard that the king of Babylon had chosen Gedaliah son of Ahikam , son of Shaphan , to be governor over them .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	12	When the people of Judah heard this news , they came back to the land of Judah . They came back to Gedaliah at Mizpah from all the countries where they had been scattered . So they came back and gathered a large harvest of wine and summer fruit .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	13	Johanan son of Kareah and all the officers of the army of Judah who were still in the open country came to Gedaliah . Gedaliah was at the town of Mizpah .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	14	Johanan and the officers with him said to Gedaliah , “ Do you know that Baalis , the king of the Ammonites , wants to kill you ? He has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you. ” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam didn ’ t believe them .
ERV	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah . Johanan said to Gedaliah , “ Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah . No one will know anything about it . We should not let Ishmael kill you . That would cause all the people of Judah who are gathered around you to be scattered to different countries again . And that would mean that the few survivors of Judah would be lost. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah , “ Don ’ t kill Ishmael . The things you are saying about Ishmael are not true. ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 40:5 Or … Gedaliah Or “ Before Gedaliah goes back , return to him … . ”
ERV	Jeremiah	41	41	In the seventh month , Ishmael son of Nethaniah ( the son of Elishama ) came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam . Ishmael came with ten of his men . They came to the town of Mizpah . Ishmael was a member of the king ’ s family . He had been one of the officers of the king of Judah . Ishmael and his men ate a meal with Gedaliah .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	2	While they were eating together , Ishmael and his ten men got up and killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam with a sword . Gedaliah was the man the king of Babylon had chosen to be governor of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at the town of Mizpah . He also killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there with Gedaliah . 4-5 The day after Gedaliah was murdered ,
ERV	Jeremiah	41	80	men and throw them into a deep cistern ! But ten of the men said to Ishmael , “ Don ’ t kill us ! We have hidden some things in a field . We have wheat and barley and oil and honey. ” So Ishmael stopped and didn ’ t kill them with the others .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael left Mizpah and went to meet the
ERV	Jeremiah	41	9	( Ishmael threw the dead bodies into the cistern until it was full , and that cistern was very big ! It had been built by a king of Judah named Asa . King Asa had made the cistern so that during war there would be water in the city . [ c ] Asa did this to protect his city from King Baasha of Israel . )
ERV	Jeremiah	41	10	Ishmael captured all the other people in the town of Mizpah and started to cross over to the country of the Ammonites . They included the king ’ s daughters , and all those who were left there . Nebuzaradan , the commander of the king of Babylon ’ s special guards , had chosen Gedaliah to watch over those people .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	11	Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the evil things Ishmael had done .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	12	So Johanan and the army officers with him took their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah . They caught Ishmael near the big pool of water that is at the town of Gibeon .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	13	When the captives that Ishmael had taken saw Johanan and the army officers , they were very happy .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	14	Then all the captives who Ishmael had taken from the town of Mizpah ran to Johanan son of Kareah .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and ran away to the Ammonites .
ERV	Jeremiah	41	16	So Johanan son of Kareah and all his army officers rescued the captives . Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah and then he had taken those people from Mizpah . Among the survivors were soldiers , women , children , and court officials . Johanan brought them back from the town of Gibeon . The Escape to Egypt 17-18 Johanan and the other army officers were afraid of the Chaldeans . The king of Babylon had chosen Gedaliah to be governor of Judah . But Ishmael murdered Gedaliah , and Johanan was afraid that the Chaldeans would be angry . So they decided to run away to Egypt . On the way to Egypt , they stayed at Geruth Kimham , near the town of Bethlehem .

ERV	Jeremiah	41	1	Kings 15:22 for the story about Asa building defenses for Mizpah .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	42	While they were at Geruth Kimham , Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah went to Jeremiah the prophet . All the army officers went with Johanan and Jezaniah . All the people , from the least important to the most important , went to Jeremiah .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	2	They said to him , “ Jeremiah , please listen to what we ask . Pray to the Lord your God for all those who are survivors from the family of Judah . Jeremiah , you can see that there are not many of us left . At one time there were many of us .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	3	Jeremiah , pray that the Lord your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	42	4	Then Jeremiah the prophet answered , “ I understand what you want me to do . I will pray to the Lord your God , as you asked me to do . I will tell you everything the Lord says . I will not hide anything from you. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	42	5	Then the people said to Jeremiah , “ If we don ’ t do everything the Lord your God tells us , then we hope the Lord will be a true and faithful witness against us . We know he will send you to tell us what to do .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	6	It doesn ’ t matter if we like the message or if we don ’ t like the message . We will obey the Lord our God . We are sending you to the Lord for a message from him . We will obey what he says . Then good things will happen to us . Yes , we will obey the Lord our God. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	42	7	At the end of ten days , the message from the Lord came to Jeremiah .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	8	Then Jeremiah called together Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him . He also called all the other people together , from the least important to the most important .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	9	Then Jeremiah said to them , “ You sent me to the Lord , the God of Israel , and I asked him what you wanted me to ask . This is what he says :
ERV	Jeremiah	42	10	‘ If you will stay in Judah , I will make you strong—I will not destroy you . I will plant you , and I will not pull you up . I will do this because I am sad about the terrible things that I made happen to you .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	11	Now you are afraid of the king of Babylon . But don ’ t be afraid of him . Don ’ t be afraid of the king of Babylon , ’ says the Lord , ‘ because I am with you . I will save you . I will rescue you . He will not get his hands on you .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	12	I will be kind to you , and the king of Babylon will also treat you with mercy . He will bring you back to your land. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	42	13	But you might say , ‘ We will not stay in Judah. ’ If you say that , you will disobey the Lord your God .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	14	And you might say , ‘ No , we will go and live in Egypt . We will not be bothered with war there . We will not hear the trumpets of war , and in Egypt we will not be hungry. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	42	15	If you say that , listen to this message from the Lord , you survivors from Judah . This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ If you decide to go and live in Egypt , this will happen :
ERV	Jeremiah	42	16	You are afraid of the sword of war , but it will defeat you there . And you are worried about hunger , but you will be hungry in Egypt . You will die there .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	17	Everyone who decides to go live in Egypt will die by war , hunger , or disease . Not one person who goes to Egypt will survive . Not one of them will escape the terrible things that I will bring to them. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	42	18	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ I showed my anger against Jerusalem . I punished the people who lived there . In the same way I will show my anger against everyone who goes to Egypt . People will use you as an example when they ask for bad things to happen to other people . You will become like a curse word . People will be ashamed of you , and they will insult you . And you will never see Judah again. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	42	19	“ Survivors of Judah , the Lord told you : ‘ Don ’ t go to Egypt. ’ I warn you right now ,
ERV	Jeremiah	42	20	you are making a mistake that will cause your deaths . You sent me to the Lord your God . You said to me , ‘ Pray to the Lord our God for us . Tell us everything the Lord our God says to do . We will obey him. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	42	21	So today I have told you the message from the Lord . But you have not obeyed the Lord your God . You have not done all that he sent me to tell you to do .
ERV	Jeremiah	42	22	So now be sure you understand this : You want to go live in Egypt . But these things will happen to you in Egypt : You will die by a sword , or hunger , or terrible sickness . ”
ERV	Jeremiah	43	43	So Jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the Lord their God . He told them everything that the Lord their God had sent him to tell them .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah , Johanan son of Kareah , and some other men were proud and stubborn . They became angry with Jeremiah . They said to him , “ Jeremiah , you are lying ! The Lord our God didn ’ t send you to say to us , ‘ You must not go to Egypt to live there. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	43	3	Jeremiah , we think that Baruch son of Neriah is encouraging you to be against us . He wants you to give us to the Babylonians . He wants you to do this so they can kill us . Or he wants you to do this so that they can make us captives and take us to Babylon. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan , the army officers , and all the people disobeyed the Lord ’ s command . The Lord had commanded them to stay in Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	5	But Johanan , son of Kareah , and the army officers did not obey this command . Instead , they took the survivors from Judah to Egypt . In the past the enemy had taken the survivors to other countries , but they had come back to Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	6	Now Johanan and all the army officers took all the men , women , and children and led them to Egypt . Among those people were the king ’ s daughters . ( Nebuzaradan had put Gedaliah in charge of those people . Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king of Babylon ’ s special guards . ) Johanan also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	7	These people didn ’ t listen to the Lord . So they all went to Egypt to the town of Tahpanhes . [ a ]
ERV	Jeremiah	43	8	In the town of Tahpanhes , Jeremiah received this message from the Lord :
ERV	Jeremiah	43	9	“ Jeremiah , get some large stones . Take them and bury them in the clay and brick sidewalk in front of Pharaoh ’ s official building in Tahpanhes . Do this while the people of Judah are watching you .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	10	Then say to those who are watching you : ‘ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : I will send for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to come here . He is my servant , and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here . Nebuchadnezzar will spread his canopy [ b ] above these stones .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	11	He will come here and attack Egypt . He will bring death to those who are to die . He will bring captivity to those who are to be taken captive . And he will bring the sword to those who are to be killed with a sword .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	12	Nebuchadnezzar will start a fire in the temples of the false gods of Egypt . He will burn the temples and he will take the idols away . Shepherds pick the bugs and thorns off their clothes to make them clean . In the same way Nebuchadnezzar will pick Egypt clean . Then he will safely leave Egypt .
ERV	Jeremiah	43	13	He will destroy the memorial stones that are in the temple of the Sun God [ c ] in Egypt , and he will burn down the temples of the false gods of Egypt. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 43:7 Tahpanhes A town in northeastern Egypt . - Jeremiah 43:10 canopy A temporary covering used for shade . It is like a tent without sides . - Jeremiah 43:13 Sun God This was the most important god in Egypt .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	44	Jeremiah received a message from the Lord for all the people of Judah living in Egypt . The message was for the people of Judah living in the towns of Migdol , Tahpanhes , Memphis , and southern Egypt . This was the message :
ERV	Jeremiah	44	2	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ You people saw the disasters that I brought on the city of Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah . The towns are empty piles of stones today .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	3	They were destroyed because the people living in them did evil . They gave sacrifices to other gods , and that made me angry ! Your people and your ancestors did not worship those gods in the past .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	4	I sent my servants , the prophets , to those people again and again . They spoke my message and said to the people , “ Don ’ t do this terrible thing . I hate for you to worship idols. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	44	5	But they didn ’ t listen to the prophets or pay attention to them . They didn ’ t stop doing wicked things . They didn ’ t stop making sacrifices to other gods .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	6	So I showed my anger against them . I punished the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem . My anger made Jerusalem and the towns of Judah the empty piles of stone they are today. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	44	7	“ So this is what the Lord God All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ Why are you hurting yourselves by continuing to worship idols ? You are separating the men and women , the children and babies from the family of Judah . And so you leave yourselves without anyone left from the family of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	8	Why do you people want to make me angry by making idols ? Now you are living in Egypt . And now you are making me angry by offering sacrifices to the false gods of Egypt . You will destroy yourselves , and it will be your own fault . The people of all the other nations on the earth will say bad things about you and make fun of you .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten about the wicked things your ancestors did ? And have you forgotten about the wicked things the kings and queens of Judah did ? Have you forgotten about the wicked things you and your wives did in Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
ERV	Jeremiah	44	10	Even to this day the people of Judah have not made themselves humble . They have not shown any respect for me , and they have not followed my teachings . They have not obeyed the laws I gave you and your ancestors. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	44	11	“ So this is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of Israel , says : ‘ I have decided to make terrible things happen to you . I will destroy the whole family of Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	12	There were a few survivors from Judah . They came here to Egypt . But I will destroy the few survivors from the family of Judah . They will be killed with swords or die from hunger . The people of other nations will point at them and wish evil for them . People will be shocked and frightened by what has happened to them . The name Judah will become a curse word and an insult .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	13	I will punish those who have gone to live in Egypt . I will use war , hunger , and disease to punish them . I will punish them just as I punished the city of Jerusalem .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	14	Not one of the few survivors of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape my punishment . None of them will survive to come back to Judah . They want to come back to Judah and live there . But not one of them will go back to Judah , except a few people who escape. ’ ”
ERV	Jeremiah	44	15	There were many people from Judah living in southern Egypt . Many of the women from Judah were meeting together in a large group and making sacrifices to other gods , and their husbands knew what they were doing . Those men said to Jeremiah ,
ERV	Jeremiah	44	16	“ We will not listen to the message from the Lord that you spoke to us .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	17	We promised to make sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven , and we will do everything we promised . We will offer sacrifices and pour out drink offerings in worship to her . We did that in the past . Our ancestors , our kings , and our officials did that in the past . All of us did those things in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . When we worshiped the Queen of Heaven , we had plenty of food . We were successful . Nothing bad happened to us .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	18	But then we stopped making sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven , and we stopped pouring out drink offerings to her . And we have had problems ever since we stopped worshiping her . Our people have been killed by war and hunger. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	44	19	Then the women spoke up [ a ] and said to Jeremiah , “ Our husbands knew what we were doing . We had their permission to make sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven . We had their permission to pour out drink offerings to her . Our husbands also knew that we were making cakes that looked like her. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the men and women who told him these things .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	21	He said , “ The Lord remembered that you made sacrifices in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem . You and your ancestors , your kings , your officials , and the people of the land did that . He remembered what you had done and thought about it .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	22	The Lord hated the terrible things you did , and he could not be patient with you any longer . So he made your country an empty desert . No one lives there now . Other people say bad things about that country .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	23	The reason all those bad things happened to you is that you made sacrifices to other gods . You sinned against the Lord . You didn ’ t obey him or follow his teachings or the laws he gave you . You didn ’ t keep your part of the agreement . [ b ] ”
ERV	Jeremiah	44	24	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the men and women . He said , “ All you people of Judah who are now in Egypt , listen to this message from the Lord .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	25	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : ‘ You women did what you said you would do . You said , “ We will keep the promises we made . We promised to make sacrifices and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven. ” So go ahead . Do what you promised you would do . Keep your promises. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	44	26	But listen to this message from the Lord , all you people of Judah who are living in Egypt : ‘ I , the Lord , use my own great name to make this promise : None of the people of Judah who are now living in Egypt will ever again use my name to make promises . They will never again say , “ As surely as the Lord God lives …. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	44	27	I am watching over the people of Judah , but I am not watching over them to take care of them . I am watching over them to bring them harm . The people of Judah who live in Egypt will die from hunger or be killed in war until they are completely destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	28	Some people of Judah will escape being killed by the sword . They will come back to Judah from Egypt . But only a few people of Judah will escape . Then the survivors of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word proves to be true . They will know whether it was my word or their word that came true .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	29	I will give you people proof , ’ says the Lord , ‘ that I will punish you here in Egypt . Then you will know for sure that my promises to harm you will really happen .
ERV	Jeremiah	44	30	This will be your proof that I will do what I say. ’ This is what the Lord says : ‘ Pharaoh Hophra is the king of Egypt . His enemies want to kill him . I will give Pharaoh Hophra to his enemies . Just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah to his enemy Nebuchadnezzar , in the same way I will give Pharaoh Hophra to his enemies. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 44:19 Then the women spoke up This is from the ancient Greek version . - Jeremiah 44:23 agreement This probably means the Law of Moses , the commands and agreement God made with the Israelites .
ERV	Jeremiah	45	45	In the fourth year that Jehoiakim [ a ] son of Josiah was king of Judah , Jeremiah the prophet spoke these things to Baruch son of Neriah . Baruch wrote them on a scroll . This is what Jeremiah said to Baruch :
ERV	Jeremiah	45	2	“ This is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says to you :
ERV	Jeremiah	45	3	‘ Baruch , you have said , “ It is very bad for me . The Lord has given me sorrow along with my pain . I am very tired . I am worn out because of my suffering . I can not find rest. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	45	4	Jeremiah , tell Baruch that this is what the Lord says : I will tear down what I have built , and I will pull up what I have planted . I will do that everywhere in Judah .
ERV	Jeremiah	45	5	Baruch , you are looking for great things for yourself . Don ’ t look for them , because I will make terrible things happen to all the people. ’ This is what the Lord said . ‘ You will have to go many places . But I will let you escape alive wherever you go. ’ ” Footnotes - Jeremiah 45:1 the fourth year … Jehoiakim This was about

ERV	Jeremiah	46	14	“ Announce this message in Egypt . Tell it in the city of Migdol . Tell it in Memphis and Tahpanhes . ‘ Get ready for war , because people all around you are being killed with swords. ’

ERV	Jeremiah	46	16	They will stumble again and again . They will fall over each other . They will say , ‘ Get up ; let ’ s go back to our own people . Let us go back to our homeland . Our enemy is defeating us . We must get away. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	46	17	In their homelands , those soldiers will say , ‘ Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , is only a lot of noise . His time of glory is over. ’ ”

ERV	Jeremiah	48	34	“ The people of the towns of Heshbon and Elealeh are crying . Their cry is heard even as far away as the town of Jahaz . Their cry is heard from the town of Zoar , as far away as the towns of Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah . Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up .

ERV	Jeremiah	48	36	“ I am very sad for Moab . My heart cries like the sad sound of a flute playing a funeral song . I am sad for the people from Kir Hareseth . Their money and riches have all been taken away .

ERV	Jeremiah	49	49	This message is about the Ammonites . This is what the Lord says : “ Ammonites , do you think that the people of Israel don ’ t have children ? Do you think there are no children to take the land when the parents die ? Maybe that is why Milcom took Gad ’ s [ a ] land ? ”
ERV	Jeremiah	49	2	The Lord says , “ The time will come in Rabbah of Ammon [ b ] when people hear the sounds of battle . Rabbah of Ammon will be destroyed . It will be an empty hill covered with ruined buildings , and the towns around it will be burned . Those people forced the people of Israel to leave their own land . But later , Israel will force them to leave. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	49	3	“ People in Heshbon , cry because the town of Ai is destroyed ! Women in Rabbah of Ammon , cry ! Put on sackcloth and cry . Run to the city for safety , because the enemy will take away the god Milcom , with his priests and officials .

ERV	Jeremiah	49	17	“ Edom will be destroyed . People will be shocked to see the destroyed cities . They will whistle from amazement at the destroyed cities .

I will go to Edom . And I will frighten the people and make them run away . None of their young men will stop me . No one is like me . No one will challenge me . None of their leaders will stand up against me. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	49	20	So listen to what the Lord has planned to do to the people of Edom . Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in Teman . The enemy will drag away the young kids of Edom ’ s flock . Edom ’ s pastures will be empty because of what they did .
ERV	Jeremiah	49	21	At the sound of Edom ’ s fall , the earth will shake . Their cry will be heard all the way to the Red Sea .

ERV	Jeremiah	50	3	A nation from the north will attack Babylon . That nation will make Babylon like an empty desert . No one will live there . Both men and animals will run away. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	50	4	The Lord says , “ At that time the people of Israel and the people of Judah will be together . They will cry and cry together , and together , they will go look for the Lord their God .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	5	They will ask how to go to Zion . They will start to go in that direction . They will say , ‘ Come , let us join ourselves to the Lord . Let ’ s make an agreement that will last forever . Let ’ s make an agreement that we will never forget. ’
ERV	Jeremiah	50	6	“ My people have been like lost sheep . Their shepherds led them the wrong way and caused them to wander away into the mountains and hills . They forgot where their resting place was .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	7	They were attacked by all who saw them . And their attackers said , ‘ We were not wrong to attack them because they sinned against the Lord . They should have stayed close to him , their true resting place . The Lord is the one their fathers trusted in. ’

The Lord is giving her people the punishment they deserve . You nations should give Babylon the punishment she deserves . Do to her what she has done to other nations .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	16	Don ’ t let the people from Babylon plant their crops . Don ’ t let them gather the harvest . The soldiers of Babylon brought many prisoners to their city . Now the enemy soldiers have come , so the prisoners are going back home . They are running back to their own countries .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	17	“ Israel is like a flock of sheep that was scattered all over the country . Israel is like sheep that were chased away by lions . The first lion to attack was the king of Assyria . The last lion to crush Israel ’ s bones was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon .

ERV	Jeremiah	50	39	Babylon will never again be filled with people . Wild dogs , ostriches , and other desert animals will live there . But no one will live there ever again .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	40	God completely destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them . In the same way no one will live in Babylon , and no one will ever go to live there. ” This is what the Lord says .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	41	“ Look ! There are people coming from the north . They come from a powerful nation . Many kings are coming together from all around the world .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	42	Their armies have bows and spears . The soldiers are cruel . They have no mercy . The soldiers come riding on their horses ; the sound is as loud as the roaring sea . They stand in their places , ready for battle . They are ready to attack you , city of Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Babylon heard about those armies , and he is paralyzed with fear . He is overcome with fear and pain , like a woman giving birth .
ERV	Jeremiah	50	44	“ Sometimes a lion will come from the thick bushes near the Jordan River . It will walk into the fields where people have their animals . I will be like that lion ; I will chase Babylon from its land . Who should I choose to do this ? There is no one like me . There is no one who can challenge me . No shepherd will come to chase me away . I will chase away the Babylonians. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	50	45	Listen to what the Lord has planned to do to Babylon . Listen to what he has decided to do to the Babylonians . “ I promise that an enemy will drag away the young kids of Babylon ’ s flock , and Babylon will become an empty pasture .

ERV	Jeremiah	51	5	The Lord All-Powerful did not leave Israel and Judah alone , like a widow . No , they are guilty of leaving the Holy One of Israel . Their God did not leave them . They left him !
ERV	Jeremiah	51	6	Run away from Babylon . Run to save your lives ! Don ’ t stay and be killed because of Babylon ’ s sins ! It is time for the Lord to punish the Babylonians for the bad things they have done . Babylon will get the punishment that she should have .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon was like a golden cup in the Lord ’ s hand . Babylon made the whole world drunk . The nations drank Babylon ’ s wine , so they went crazy .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	8	But Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken . Cry for her ! Get medicine for her pain , and maybe she can be healed .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	9	We tried to heal Babylon , but she can not be healed . So let us leave her , and let each of us go to our own country . God in heaven will decide Babylon ’ s punishment . He will decide what will happen to Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	10	The Lord got even for us . Come , let ’ s tell about that in Zion . Let ’ s tell what the Lord our God has done .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	11	Sharpen the arrows ! Get your shields ! The Lord has stirred up the kings of the Medes because he wants to destroy Babylon . The army from Babylon destroyed his Temple in Jerusalem , so he will give them the punishment they deserve .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	12	Lift up a flag against the walls of Babylon . Bring more guards . Put the watchmen in their places . Get ready for a secret attack . The Lord will do what he has planned . He will do what he said he would do against the people of Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	13	Babylon , you live near much water . You are rich with treasures , but your end as a nation has come . It is time for you to be destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	14	The Lord All-Powerful used his name to make this promise : “ Babylon , I will fill you with so many enemy soldiers they will be like a cloud of locusts . They will win their war against you . They will stand over you shouting their victory cry. ”

ERV	Jeremiah	51	17	But people are so stupid . They don ’ t understand what God has done . Skilled workers make statues of false gods . Those statues are only false gods . They show how foolish those workers are . Those statues are not alive .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	18	Those idols are worthless . People made them , and they are nothing but a joke . Their time of judgment will come , and those idols will be destroyed .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	19	But God , who is Jacob ’ s Portion , is not like those worthless statues . People didn ’ t make God ; God made his people . He made everything . His name is the Lord All-Powerful .

ERV	Jeremiah	51	25	The Lord says , “ Babylon , you are like a volcano that destroys the whole country . But I have turned against you , and I will turn you into a burned-out mountain .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	26	People will not take stones from Babylon to use as the foundation of a building . That is because they will not find any stones big enough for cornerstones . Your city will be a pile of broken rocks forever. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	27	“ Lift up the war flag in the land ! Blow the trumpet in all the nations ! Prepare the nations for war against Babylon . Call these kingdoms to come fight against Babylon : Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz . Choose a commander to lead the army against her . Send so many horses that they are like a swarm of locusts .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	28	Get the nations ready for battle against her . Get the kings of the Medes ready . Get their governors and all their important officials ready . Get all the countries they rule ready for battle against Babylon .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	29	The land shakes and moves as if it is in pain . It will shake when the Lord does to Babylon what he plans— to make the land of Babylon an empty desert , a place where no one will live .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	30	Babylon ’ s soldiers have stopped fighting . They stay in their forts . Their strength is gone . They have become like frightened women . Babylon ’ s houses are burning . The bars of her gates are broken .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	31	One messenger follows another . Messenger follows messenger . They announce to the king of Babylon that his whole city has been captured .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	32	The places where people cross the rivers have been captured . The swamplands are burning . All of Babylon ’ s soldiers are afraid. ”
ERV	Jeremiah	51	33	This is what the Lord All-Powerful , the God of the people of Israel , says : “ Babylon is like a threshing floor , where people beat the grain at harvest time . And the time to beat Babylon is coming soon .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	34	“ King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed us in the past . In the past he hurt us . In the past he took our people away , and we became like an empty jar . He took the best we had . He was like a giant monster that ate everything until it was full . He took the best we had and then threw us away .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	35	Babylon did terrible things to hurt us . Now I want those things to happen to Babylon. ” The people living in Zion said , “ The people of Babylon are guilty of killing our people . Now they are being punished for the bad things they did. ” The city of Jerusalem said those things .

ERV	Jeremiah	51	39	They are acting like powerful lions . I will give a party for them . I will make them drunk . They will laugh and have a good time , and then they will sleep forever . They will never wake up. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	40	“ Babylon will be like sheep , rams , and goats waiting to be killed . I will lead them to the slaughter .
ERV	Jeremiah	51	41	“ Sheshach [ c ] will be defeated . The best and proudest country of the whole earth will be taken captive . People from other nations will look at Babylon , and what they see will make them afraid .

ERV	Lamentations	4	8	But now their faces are blacker than soot . No one even recognizes them in the streets . Their skin is wrinkled over their bones . Their skin is like wood .
ERV	Lamentations	4	9	It was better for those who were killed by the sword than for those who died of hunger . Those starving people were sad and hurt . They died because they got no food from the field .
ERV	Lamentations	4	10	Then even nice women cooked their own children . The children were food for their mothers . This happened when my people were destroyed .
ERV	Lamentations	4	11	The Lord used all of his anger . He poured out all his anger . He made a fire in Zion that burned it down to the foundations .
ERV	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth could not believe what had happened . The people of the world could not believe what had happened . They could not believe that enemies would be able to come through the city gates of Jerusalem .

ERV	Lamentations	4	15	People shouted , “ Go away ! Go away ! Don ’ t touch us. ” They wandered around and had no home . People in other nations said , “ We don ’ t want them to live with us. ”
ERV	Lamentations	4	16	The Lord himself destroyed them . He didn ’ t look after them anymore . He didn ’ t respect the priests . He was not friendly to the elders of Judah .
ERV	Lamentations	4	17	We have worn out our eyes looking for help , but no help comes . We kept on looking for a nation to save us . We kept watch from our watchtower , but no nation came to us .
ERV	Lamentations	4	18	Our enemies hunted us all the time . We could not even go out into the streets . Our end came near . Our time was up . Our end came !
ERV	Lamentations	4	19	The men who chased us were faster than eagles in the sky . They chased us into the mountains . They hid in the desert to catch us .
ERV	Lamentations	4	20	The king was very important to us . He was like the breath we breathe , but he was trapped by them . The Lord himself chose the king , and we said this about the king , “ We will live in his shadow . He protects us from the nations. ”
ERV	Lamentations	4	21	Be happy , people of Edom . Be happy , you who live in the land of Uz . But remember , the cup of the Lord ’ s anger will come around to you too . When you drink from that cup , you will get drunk and strip off all your clothes .
ERV	Lamentations	4	22	Your punishment is complete , Zion . You will not go into captivity again . But the Lord will punish your sins , people of Edom . He will uncover your sins .

ERV	Ezekiel	1	1	I am the priest , Ezekiel son of Buzi . I was in exile by the Kebar Canal in Babylonia when the skies opened up , and I saw visions of God . This was on the fifth day of the fourth month of the thirtieth year . [ a ] ( This was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin ’ s exile . The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel . The power of the Lord came over him at that place . ) The Chariot of the Lord—God ’ s Throne
ERV	Ezekiel	1	4	I was watching a big storm come in from the north . It was a big cloud with a strong wind , and there was fire flashing from it . Light was shining out all around it . It looked like hot metal [ b ] glowing in a fire .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	5	Inside the cloud , there were four living beings that looked like people .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	6	But each one of them had four faces and four wings .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight . Their feet looked like calves ’ feet , and they sparkled like polished brass .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	8	Under their wings were human arms . There were four living beings . Each living being had four faces and four wings .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	9	The wings touched each other . The living beings did not turn when they moved . They went in the direction they were looking .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	10	Each living being had four faces . In the front they each had a man ’ s face . There was a lion ’ s face on the right side and a bull ’ s face on the left side . There was an eagle ’ s face on the back .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	11	Their wings were spread out over them . With two of the wings each living being reached out to touch the one near it , and with the other two wings it covered its body .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	12	Each living being went in the direction it was looking . They went wherever the spirit [ c ] caused them to go , but they did not turn when they moved .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	13	That is what the living beings looked like . Inside the area between the living beings , there was something that looked like burning coals of fire . This fire was like small torches that kept moving around among the living beings . The fire glowed brightly and lightning flashed from it .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	14	The living beings ran back and forth—as fast as lightning . [ d ] 15-16 I was looking at the living beings when I noticed four wheels that touched the ground . There was one wheel by each living being . All the wheels looked the same . The wheels looked as if they were made from a clear , yellow jewel . They looked like there was a wheel inside a wheel .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	17	They could turn to move in any direction . But the living beings did not turn when they moved . [ e ]
ERV	Ezekiel	1	18	The rims of the wheels were tall and frightening . There were eyes all over the rims of all four wheels .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	19	The wheels always moved with the living beings . If the living beings went up into the air , the wheels went with them .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	20	. - Ezekiel 1:14 Or “ And there was something like lighting shooting back and forth among the living beings. ” - Ezekiel 1:17 The wheels … moved Or “ The wheels could move in any four directions , but they did not turn when they moved. ” - Ezekiel 1:22 bowl This Hebrew word is the same word used in Gen. 1:6-7 to describe the dome of the sky .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	21	So if the living beings moved , the wheels moved . If the living beings stopped , the wheels stopped . If the wheels went into the air , the living beings went with them , because the spirit was in the wheels .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	22	There was an amazing thing over the heads of the living beings . It was like a bowl [ f ] turned upside down , and the bowl was clear like crystal .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	23	Under this bowl , each living being had wings reaching out to the one next to it . Two wings spread out one way and two wings spread out the other way , covering its body .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	24	Then I heard the wings . Every time the living beings moved , their wings made a very loud noise like a lot of water rushing by . They were loud like the Lord All-Powerful . They were as loud as an army or a crowd of people . When the living beings stopped moving , they put their wings down by their side .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	25	The living beings stopped moving and lowered their wings . Then there was another loud sound that came from above the bowl over their heads .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	26	There was something that looked like a throne on top of the bowl . It was blue like sapphire . There was also something that looked like a man sitting on the throne .
ERV	Ezekiel	1	27	. - Ezekiel 1:12 spirit Or “ wind. ” Also in verse
ERV	Ezekiel	1	28	The light shining around him was like a rainbow in a cloud . It was the Glory of the Lord . As soon as I saw that , I fell to the ground . I bowed with my face to the ground , and then I heard a voice speaking to me .

ERV	Ezekiel	2	2	Then the Spirit came into me [ b ] and lifted me up on my feet , and I listened to the one who spoke to me .
ERV	Ezekiel	2	3	He said , “ Son of man , I am sending you to speak to the family of Israel . Those people and their ancestors turned against me many times . They have sinned against me many times—and they are still sinning against me today .
ERV	Ezekiel	2	4	I am sending you to speak to them , but they are very stubborn . They are very hardheaded , but you must speak to them . You must say , ‘ This is what the Lord God says. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	2	5	They are people who refuse to obey , so they may not listen to you . But even if they don ’ t stop sinning , at least they will know that there is a prophet living among them .
ERV	Ezekiel	2	6	“ Son of man , don ’ t be afraid of the people or what they say . It is true : they will turn against you and try to hurt you . Their words will be sharp like thorns and will sting like scorpions . But don ’ t be afraid of what they say . They are people who refuse to obey , but don ’ t be afraid of them .
ERV	Ezekiel	2	7	You must tell them what I say , whether they listen or not . They are people who usually refuse to listen !
ERV	Ezekiel	2	8	“ Son of man , listen to what I am telling you . Don ’ t turn against me like those people who refuse to obey . Now open your mouth to receive the words I will give you to speak. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	2	9	Then I saw an arm reach out toward me . It was holding a scroll with words written on it .
ERV	Ezekiel	2	10	It rolled the scroll open in front of me . Words were on the front and on the back of the scroll . There were all kinds of sad songs , sad stories , and warnings . Footnotes - Ezekiel 2:1 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel , as one the Lord chose to be his prophet . It is used in this sense throughout this book . - Ezekiel 2:2 the Spirit came into me Or “ a wind came . ”
ERV	Ezekiel	3	3	,
ERV	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth and he put the scroll into my mouth .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	4	,
ERV	Ezekiel	3	5	I am not sending you to some foreigners you can not understand . You don ’ t have to learn another language . I am sending you to the family of Israel .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	6	I am not sending you to many different countries where people speak languages you can not understand . If you went to those people and spoke to them , they would listen to you . But you will not have to learn those hard languages .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	7	No , I am sending you to the family of Israel . Only , these people have hard heads—they are very stubborn ! And the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you . They don ’ t want to listen to me .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	8	But I will make you just as stubborn as they are , and your head just as hard .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	9	A diamond is harder than flint rock . In the same way you will be more stubborn than they are , and your head will be harder . Then you will not be afraid of them or those who always turn against me. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	3	10	,
ERV	Ezekiel	3	11	Then go to all of your people in exile and tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says …. ’ They will not listen , and they will not stop sinning , but you must still tell them my message. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit [ b ] lifted me up , and I heard a voice behind me . It was very loud , like thunder . It said , “ Blessed is the Glory of the Lord ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	3	13	Then the wings of the living beings began moving . The wings made a very loud noise as they touched each other , and the wheels in front of them began making a noise as loud as thunder .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	14	The Spirit lifted me and took me away . I was very sad and upset in my spirit , but I felt the Lord ’ s power in me .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	15	I went to the people of Israel who were forced to live in Tel Aviv [ c ] by the Kebar Canal . I sat there among them for seven days , shocked and silent . The Watchman of Israel
ERV	Ezekiel	3	16	After seven days , the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,
ERV	Ezekiel	3	17	,
ERV	Ezekiel	3	18	If I say , ‘ These evil people will die ! ’ Then you must warn them . You must tell them to change their lives and stop doing evil . If you don ’ t warn them , they will die because they sinned . But I will also make you responsible for their death , because you did not go to them and save their lives .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	19	“ If you warn them and tell them to change their lives and stop doing evil , but they refuse to listen , they will die because they sinned . But since you warned them , you will have saved your own life .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	20	“ If good people stop being good and begin to do evil , and I send something that makes them stumble and sin , they will die because they sinned . But since you did not warn them and remind them of the good things they had done , I will make you responsible for their death .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	21	“ But if you warn good people and tell them to stop sinning , and they listen to your warning and stop sinning , they will not die . In that way you will have saved your own life. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	3	22	The Lord ’ s power came to me . He said to me , “ Get up and go to the valley . [ d ] I will speak to you in that place. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	3	23	So I got up and went out to the valley . The Glory of the Lord was there—as I had seen it by the Kebar Canal . So I bowed with my face to the ground .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	24	. - Ezekiel 3:15 Tel Aviv This was a place outside of Israel . The name means “ Spring Hill. ” - Ezekiel 3:22 the valley Possibly , Jezreel Valley , a fertile area where many battles were fought . It is often called simply “ The Valley . ”

ERV	Ezekiel	3	26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth—you will not be able to talk . So they will not have anyone to teach them that they are doing wrong , because they are always turning against me .
ERV	Ezekiel	3	27	But I will talk to you , and then I will allow you to speak . But you must say to them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says. ’ If a person wants to listen , fine . If a person refuses to listen , fine . But those people always turn against me .

ERV	Ezekiel	4	4	“ Then you must lie down on your left side . You must do this thing that shows that you are taking the sins of the people of Israel on yourself . You will carry the guilt for as many days as you lie on your left side .
ERV	Ezekiel	4	2	And then pretend you are an army surrounding the city . Build a dirt wall around the city to help you attack it . Build a dirt road leading up to the city wall . Bring battering rams [ b ] and set up army camps around the city .

ERV	Ezekiel	4	7	“ Now , roll up your sleeve and raise your arm over the brick . Act like you are attacking the city of Jerusalem . Do this to show that you are speaking as my messenger to the people .
ERV	Ezekiel	4	8	Now look , I am tying ropes on you . You will not be able to roll over from one side to the other until your attack against the city [ d ] is finished .
ERV	Ezekiel	4	9	“ You must get some grain to make bread . Get some wheat , barley , beans , lentils , millet , and spelt . Mix all these things together in one bowl and grind them to make flour . You will use this flour to make bread . You will eat only this bread during the

ERV	Ezekiel	4	13	Then the Lord said , “ This will show that the family of Israel will eat unclean bread in foreign countries and that I am the one who forced them to leave Israel and go to those countries ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	4	14	Then I said , “ Oh , but Lord God , I have never eaten any unclean food . I have never eaten meat from an animal that died from a disease or from an animal that was killed by a wild animal . I have never eaten unclean meat—not from the time that I was a little baby until now . None of that bad meat ever entered my mouth. ”

ERV	Ezekiel	7	13	The people who sold their property [ a ] will never go back to it . Even if some people escape alive , they will never go back to their property , because this vision is for the whole crowd . So even if some people escape alive , it will not make everyone feel better .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	14	“ They will blow the trumpet to warn the people . The people will get ready for battle , but they will not go out to fight because I will show the whole crowd how angry I am .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	15	The enemy with his sword is outside the city . Disease and hunger is inside the city . If some people go out into the fields , enemy soldiers will kill them . If they stay in the city , hunger and disease will destroy them .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	16	“ But some people will escape . The survivors will run to the mountains , but they will not be happy . They will be sad for all their sins . They will cry and make sad noises like doves .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	17	They will be too tired and sad to raise their arms . Their legs will be like water .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	18	They will wear sackcloth and be covered with fear . You will see the shame on every face . They will shave their heads to show their sadness .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	19	They will throw their silver idols into the streets . They will treat their gold statues like dirty rags , because those things will not be able to save them when the Lord shows his anger . Those things were nothing but a trap that caused the people to fall . They will not give food to the people or put food in their bellies .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	20	“ They used their beautiful jewelry and made an idol . They were proud of that statue . They made their terrible statues . They made those filthy things , so I will throw them away like a dirty rag .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	21	I will let strangers take them . Those strangers will make fun of them . They will kill some of the people and take others away as prisoners .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	22	I will turn my head away from them—I will not look at them . The strangers will ruin my Temple—they will go into the secret parts of that holy building and make it unfit for worship .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	23	“ Make chains for the prisoners , because many people will be punished for killing other people . There will be violence every place in the city .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	24	I will bring evil people from other nations , and they will get all the houses of the people of Israel . I will stop all you powerful people from being so proud . Those people from other nations will get all your places of worship .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	25	“ You will shake with fear . You will look for peace , but there will be none .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	26	You will hear one sad story after another . You will hear nothing but bad news . You will look for a prophet and ask him for a vision . The priests will have nothing to teach you , and the elders will not have any good advice to give you .
ERV	Ezekiel	7	27	Your king will be crying for the people who died . The leaders will wear sackcloth . The common people will be very afraid , because I will pay them back for what they did . I will decide their punishment , and I will punish them . Then they will know that I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 7:13 sold their property In ancient Israel property did not belong to a person , it belonged to a family . People might sell their property , but at the time of Jubilee , their family would get the land back . Here , Ezekiel says the people will never get their property again .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	8	God said to me , “ Son of man , make a hole in the wall. ” So I made a hole in the wall , and there I saw a door .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	2	I saw something that looked like fire , like a man ’ s body . From the waist down , he was like fire . From the waist up , he was bright and shining like hot metal [ b ] in a fire .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	3	Then I saw something that looked like an arm . The arm reached out and grabbed me by the hair on my head . Then the Spirit [ c ] lifted me into the air , and in a vision from God he took me to Jerusalem . He took me to the inner gate—the gate that is on the north side . The statue that makes God jealous is by that gate .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	4	But the Glory of the God of Israel was there . The Glory looked just like the vision I saw in the valley by the Kebar Canal .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	5	God spoke to me . He said , “ Son of man , [ d ] look toward the north. ” So I looked , and there , north of the Altar Gate by the entrance , was that statue that made God jealous .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	6	,
ERV	Ezekiel	8	7	,
ERV	Ezekiel	8	9	Then God said to me , “ Go in and look at the terrible , evil things that the people are doing here. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and looked . I saw statues of all kinds of reptiles [ e ] and animals that you hate to think about . The statues were the filthy idols that the people of Israel worshiped . There were pictures of those animals carved all around on every wall !
ERV	Ezekiel	8	11	Then I noticed that Jaazaniah son of Shaphan and the
ERV	Ezekiel	8	70	elders of Israel were there with the people worshiping in that place . There they were , right at the front of the people , and each leader had his own incense dish in his hand . The smoke from the burning incense was rising into the air .
ERV	Ezekiel	8	12	,
ERV	Ezekiel	8	13	Then he said to me , “ If you come with me , you will see these men doing even more terrible things ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	8	14	Then God led me to the entrance to the Lord ’ s Temple . This gate was on the north side . I saw women sitting there and crying . They were sad about the false god Tammuz [ f ] !
ERV	Ezekiel	8	15	,
ERV	Ezekiel	8	16	Then he led me to the inner courtyard of the Lord ’ s Temple area . There I saw
ERV	Ezekiel	8	25	men bowing down and worshiping . They were at the entrance to the Lord ’ s Temple between the porch and the altar—but they were facing the wrong way . Their backs were to the Holy Place . They were bowing down to worship the sun !
ERV	Ezekiel	8	17	. - Ezekiel 8:10 reptiles The Hebrew word can mean “ lizards , ” “ snakes , ” and “ all kinds of bugs and insects. ” - Ezekiel 8:14 Tammuz People thought this false god died and his wife Ishtar asked everyone to be sad and cry with her .

This month was named Tammuz because of this ceremony . - Ezekiel 8:17 Look … god Or “ Look at them putting that cut branch in their noses . ”

ERV	Ezekiel	9	9	He said , “ The family of Israel and Judah has committed many terrible sins ! People are being murdered everywhere in this country , and the city is filled with crime . That is because the people say to themselves , ‘ The Lord has left this country . The Lord can not see what we are doing. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	9	2	Then I saw six men walking on the road from the upper gate . This gate is on the north side . Each man had his own deadly weapon in his hand . One of the men wore linen clothes . [ b ] He wore a scribe ’ s pen and ink set [ c ] at his waist . Those men went to the bronze altar in the Temple and stood there .
ERV	Ezekiel	9	3	Then the Glory of the God of Israel rose from above the Cherub angels where he had been . Then the Glory went to the door of the Temple and stopped when he was over the threshold . Then he called to the man wearing the linen clothes and the scribe ’ s pen and ink set .
ERV	Ezekiel	9	4	Then the Lord said to him , “ Go through the city of Jerusalem . Put a mark on the forehead of everyone who feels sad and upset about all the terrible things people are doing in this city. ” 5-6 Then I heard God say to the other men , “ I want you to follow the first man . You must kill all those who do not have the mark on their foreheads . It doesn ’ t matter if they are elders , young men or young women , children or mothers—you must use your weapon and kill everyone who does not have the mark on their forehead . Don ’ t show any mercy . Don ’ t feel sorry for anyone . Start here at my Temple. ” So they started with the elders in front of the Temple .
ERV	Ezekiel	9	7	He said to them , “ Make this Temple unclean—fill this courtyard with dead bodies ! Now go ! ” So they went and killed the people in the city .
ERV	Ezekiel	9	8	I stayed there while the men went to kill the people . I bowed with my face to the ground and said , “ Oh , Lord God , in showing your anger against Jerusalem , are you killing all the survivors in Israel ? ”
ERV	Ezekiel	9	10	So I will not show any mercy or feel sorry for them . They brought it on themselves . I am only giving them the punishment they deserve ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	9	11	.
ERV	Ezekiel	10	10	There were four wheels , and they all looked the same . They looked like there was a wheel in a wheel .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	2	Then the one sitting on the throne said to the man dressed in linen clothes , [ b ] “ Step into the area between the wheels [ c ] under the Cherub angels . Take a handful of the burning coals from between the Cherub angels and go throw them over the city of Jerusalem. ” The man walked past me .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	3	The Cherub angels were standing in the area south [ d ] of the Temple as the man walked to them . The cloud filled the inner courtyard .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the Glory of the Lord rose up off the Cherub angels near the threshold of the door of the Temple . Then the cloud filled the Temple , and the bright light from the Glory of the Lord filled the whole courtyard .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	5	The noise from the wings of the Cherub angels could be heard all the way out into the outer courtyard . The sound was very loud—like the thundering voice when God All-Powerful speaks .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	6	. - Ezekiel 10:3 south Literally , “ right. ” - Ezekiel 10:14 face of a Cherub This is the bull ’ s face mentioned in Ezek . 1:10 . See Ezek . 10:22 . - Ezekiel 10:14 vision by the Kebar Canal See Ezek .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	7	One of the Cherub angels reached out his hand and took some of the hot coals from the area between the Cherub angels . He poured the coals into the man ’ s hands , and the man left .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	8	( The Cherub angels had what looked like human arms under their wings . )
ERV	Ezekiel	10	9	Then I noticed that there were four wheels . There was one wheel by each Cherub angel , and the wheels looked like a clear yellow jewel .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	11	They could go in any direction when they moved , but the Cherub angels did not turn around when they moved . They went in the direction that the head was looking . They did not turn around when they moved .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	12	There were eyes all over their bodies . There were eyes on their backs , on their arms , on their wings , and on their wheels—on all four wheels !
ERV	Ezekiel	10	13	These wheels were what I heard called , “ the area between the wheels. ” 14-15 Each Cherub angel had four faces . The first was the face of a Cherub , [ e ] the second was the face of a man , the third was a lion ’ s face , and the fourth was an eagle ’ s face . ( These Cherub angels were the living beings I saw in the vision by the Kebar Canal . [ f ] ) Then the Cherub angels rose into the air ,
ERV	Ezekiel	10	16	and the wheels rose with them . When the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air , not even the wheels turned around .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	17	If they flew into the air , the wheels went with them . If they stood still , so did the wheels , because the spirit [ g ] of the living being was in them .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the Glory of the Lord rose from the threshold of the Temple , moved to the place over the Cherub angels , and stopped there .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	19	Then the Cherub angels raised their wings and flew into the air . I saw them leave . The wheels went with them . Then they stopped at the East Gate of the Lord ’ s Temple . The Glory of the God of Israel was in the air above them .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	20	These were the living beings under the Glory of the God of Israel in the vision at the Kebar Canal , and now I realized that they were Cherub angels .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	21	Each living being had four faces , four wings , and something that looked like human arms under their wings .
ERV	Ezekiel	10	22	The faces of the Cherub angels were the same as the four faces on the living beings in the vision by the Kebar Canal . They all looked straight ahead in the direction they were going .

ERV	Ezekiel	11	4	,
ERV	Ezekiel	11	5	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me . He said to me , “ Tell them that this is what the Lord said : House of Israel , you are planning big things . But I know what you are thinking .
ERV	Ezekiel	11	6	You have killed many people in this city . You have filled the streets with dead bodies .
ERV	Ezekiel	11	7	Now , the Lord God says this : ‘ The dead bodies are the meat , and the city is the pot . But someone will come and take you out of this safe pot .
ERV	Ezekiel	11	8	You are afraid of the sword , but I am bringing the sword against you ! ’ ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	11	9	He also said , “ I will take you out of this city and give you to strangers . I will punish you .
ERV	Ezekiel	11	10	You will die by the sword . I will punish you here in Israel , so you will know that I am the Lord .
ERV	Ezekiel	11	12	Then you will know that I am the Lord . It was my law that you broke . You did not obey my commands . You decided to live like the nations around you. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	11	13	As soon as I finished speaking for God , Pelatiah son of Benaiah died ! I fell to the ground . I bowed with my face touching the ground and said , “ Oh , Lord God , you are going to completely destroy all the survivors of Israel ! ” Prophecies Against Survivors in Jerusalem
ERV	Ezekiel	11	14	But then the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,

ERV	Ezekiel	11	23	The Glory of the Lord rose into the air and left the city and stopped on the hill east of Jerusalem . [ e ]

ERV	Ezekiel	12	4	“ During the day , take your bags outside so that the people can see you . Then in the evening , pretend you are going away . Act as if you are a prisoner going to a faraway country .
ERV	Ezekiel	12	5	While the people are watching , make a hole in the wall and go out through that hole in the wall .
ERV	Ezekiel	12	6	At night , put your bag on your shoulder and leave . Cover your face so that you can not see where you are going . You must do these things so that the people can see you , because I am using you as an example to the family of Israel. ”

ERV	Ezekiel	14	9	And if a prophet is foolish enough to give his own answer , I , the Lord , will show him how foolish he is ! I will use my power against him . I will destroy him and remove him from among my people , Israel .
ERV	Ezekiel	14	10	So both the one who came for advice and the prophet who gave an answer will get the same punishment .
ERV	Ezekiel	14	11	Why ? So that those prophets will stop leading my people away from me , and my people will stop being filthy with sin . Then they will be my special people , and I will be their God. ’ ” This is what the Lord God said . Jerusalem Will Be Punished
ERV	Ezekiel	14	12	Then the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,

ERV	Ezekiel	14	20	.
ERV	Ezekiel	14	21	Then the Lord God said , “ So think how bad it will be for Jerusalem . I will send all four of those punishments against that city ! I will send enemy soldiers , hunger , disease , and wild animals against that city . I will remove all the people and animals from that country .
ERV	Ezekiel	14	22	Some of the people will escape from that country . They will bring their sons and daughters and come to you for help . Then you will see how bad those people really are , and you will feel better about all the troubles that I am bringing to Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezekiel	14	23	You will see how they live and all the bad things they do . Then you will know that I had a good reason for punishing them. ” This is what the Lord God said . Footnotes - Ezekiel 14:3 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel . Also in verse
ERV	Ezekiel	15	15	Then the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,
ERV	Ezekiel	15	2	“ Son of man , [ a ] are the pieces of wood from a grapevine [ b ] any better than the little branches cut from trees in the forest ?
ERV	Ezekiel	15	3	Can you use that wood from a grapevine to make anything ? Can you use that wood to make pegs to hang dishes on ?
ERV	Ezekiel	15	4	People throw that wood into the fire . The ends burn , and the middle is scorched .
ERV	Ezekiel	15	5	If you can not make anything from that wood before it is burned , you surely can not make anything from that wood after it is burned !
ERV	Ezekiel	15	6	.
ERV	Ezekiel	15	7	“ I will punish those people . But some of them will be like the sticks that don ’ t burn completely . They will be punished , but they will not be destroyed completely . You will see that I punished them , and you will know that I am the Lord !
ERV	Ezekiel	15	8	I will destroy that country because the people left me to worship false gods. ” This is what the Lord God said . Footnotes - Ezekiel 15:2 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel . - Ezekiel 15:2 grapevine The prophets often compared Israel to a vineyard or grapevine . See verse
ERV	Ezekiel	16	16	You took your beautiful clothes and used them to decorate your places for worship . [ d ] And you acted like a prostitute there . You gave yourself to every man who came by !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	2	“ Son of man , tell the people of Jerusalem about the terrible things they have done .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	3	You must say , ‘ This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem : Look at your history . You were born in Canaan . Your father was an Amorite . Your mother was a Hittite .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	4	Jerusalem , on the day you were born , there was no one to cut your navel cord . No one put salt on you and washed you to make you clean . No one wrapped you in cloth .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	5	No one felt sorry for you or took care of you . On the day you were born , your parents threw you out into the field , because no one wanted you .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	6	“ ‘ Then I passed by . I saw you lying there , kicking in the blood . You were covered with blood , but I said , “ Please live ! ” Yes , you were covered with blood , but I said , “ Please live ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	16	7	I helped you grow like a plant in the field . You grew and grew . You became a young woman : your periods began , your breasts grew , and your hair began to grow . But you were still bare and naked .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	8	I looked you over . I saw you were ready for love , so I spread my clothes over you [ a ] and covered your nakedness . I promised to marry you . I made the agreement [ b ] with you , and you became mine. ’ ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	9	“ ‘ I washed you in water . I poured water over you to wash away the blood that was on you , and then I put oil on your skin .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	10	[ c ] I gave you a nice dress and soft leather sandals , a linen headband , and a silk scarf .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	11	I also gave you some jewelry . I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	12	I gave you a nose ring , earrings , and a beautiful crown to wear .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	13	You were beautiful in your gold and silver jewelry , and your linen , silk , and embroidered material . You ate the best foods . You were very , very beautiful , and you became the queen !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	14	You became famous for your beauty , all because I made you so lovely ! ’ ” This is what the Lord God said . Jerusalem , the Unfaithful Bride
ERV	Ezekiel	16	15	“ But you began to trust in your beauty . You used the good name you had and became unfaithful to me . You acted like a prostitute with every man who passed by . You gave yourself to them all !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	17	Then you took your beautiful jewelry that I gave you , and you used the gold and silver to make statues of men , and you had sex with them too !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	18	Then you took the beautiful cloth and made clothes for those statues . You took the perfume and incense I gave you and put it in front of those idols .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	19	I gave you bread , honey , and oil , but you gave that food to your idols . You offered them as a sweet smell to please your false gods . You acted like a prostitute with those false gods ! ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	20	“ You and I had children together , but you took our children . You killed them and gave them to those false gods ! But that is only some of the evil things you did when you were unfaithful to me and went to those false gods .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	21	You slaughtered [ e ] my sons and then passed them through the fire to those false gods .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	22	You left me and did all those terrible things . You never remembered what happened when you were young . You did not remember that you were naked and kicking in blood when I found you .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	23	“ After all these evil things , … it will be very bad for you ! ” The Lord God said all these things .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	24	“ After all those things , you made a mound for worshiping that false god . You built those places for worshiping false gods on every street corner .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	25	You built your mounds at the head of every road . Then you degraded your beauty . You used it to catch every man who walked by . You raised your skirt so that they could see your legs , and you acted like a prostitute with those men .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	26	Then you went to Egypt , your neighbor that is always ready for sex . With more and more sexual sin , you made me angry .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	27	So I punished you ! I took away part of your land . I let your enemies , the daughters of the Philistines , do what they wanted to you . Even they were shocked at the evil things you did .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	28	Then you went to have sex with Assyria . You could not get enough . You were never satisfied .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	29	So you turned to Canaan , and then to Babylonia , and still you were not satisfied .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	30	You are so weak . You let all those men cause you to sin . You acted just like a prostitute who wants to be the one in control. ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	31	,
ERV	Ezekiel	16	32	You are a woman guilty of adultery . You would rather have sex with strangers than with your own husband .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	33	Most prostitutes force men to pay them for sex , but you gave money to your many lovers . You paid all the men around to come in to have sex with you .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	34	You are just the opposite of most prostitutes who force men to pay them , because you pay the men to have sex with you. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	16	35	Prostitute , listen to the message from the Lord .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	36	This is what the Lord God says : “ You have spent your money [ f ] and let your lovers and filthy gods see your naked body and have sex with you . You have killed your children and poured out their blood . This was your gift to those false gods .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	37	So I am bringing all of your lovers together . I will bring all the men you loved and all the men you hated . I will bring them all together and let them see you naked . [ g ] They will see you completely naked .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	38	Then I will punish you . I will punish you as a murderer and a woman who committed the sin of adultery . You will be punished as if by an angry and jealous husband .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	39	. - Ezekiel 16:21 slaughtered This usually means to kill an animal and cut it into pieces for meat , but it often means to kill people as if they were animals . - Ezekiel 16:36 spent your money Literally , “ poured out your copper. ” This might also mean “ you have done the things that stain you with sin. ” - Ezekiel 16:37 let them see you naked The Hebrew words are like the words meaning “ to be carried away as a prisoner to a foreign country. ” - Ezekiel 16:46 Samaria … Sodom Ezekiel is saying the people in Judah are just as evil as the people who lived in Samaria and Sodom—and those people were so evil that God completely destroyed those cities . - Ezekiel 16:57 Edom Or “ Aram . ”
ERV	Ezekiel	16	40	They will bring a crowd of people and throw rocks at you to kill you . Then they will cut you into pieces with their swords .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	41	They will burn your house . They will punish you so that all the other women can see . I will stop you from living like a prostitute . I will stop you from paying money to your lovers .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	42	Then I will stop being angry and jealous . I will calm down . I will not be angry anymore .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	43	Why will all these things happen ? Because you did not remember what happened when you were young . You did all those bad things and made me angry . So I had to punish you for doing them , but you planned even more terrible things. ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	44	“ All the people who talk about you will now have one more thing to say . They will say , ‘ Like mother , like daughter. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	16	45	You are your mother ’ s daughter . You don ’ t care about your husband or your children . You are like your sister . Both of you hated your husband and your children . You are like your parents . Your mother was a Hittite and your father was an Amorite .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	46	Your older sister was Samaria . She lived to the north of you with her daughters . Your younger sister was Sodom . [ h ] She lived to the south of you with her daughters .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	47	You did all the terrible things they did , but you also did much worse !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	48	I am the Lord God . As I live , I swear that your sister Sodom and her daughters never did as many bad things as you and your daughters .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	49	“ Your sister Sodom and her daughters were proud . They had too much to eat and too much time on their hands , and they did not help poor , helpless people .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	50	Sodom and her daughters became too proud and began to do terrible things in front of me . So I punished them !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	51	“ And Samaria did only half as many bad things as you did . You did many more terrible things than Samaria ! You have done so many more terrible things than your sisters have done . Sodom and Samaria seem good compared to you .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	52	So you must bear your shame . You have made your sisters look good compared to you . You have done terrible things , so you should be ashamed .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	53	“ I destroyed Sodom and the towns around it , and I destroyed Samaria and the towns around it . And I will destroy you too , Jerusalem . But I will build those cities again , and I will rebuild you too .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	54	I will comfort you . Then you will remember the terrible things you did , and you will be ashamed .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	55	So you and your sisters will be rebuilt . Sodom and the towns around her , Samaria and the towns around her , and you and the towns around you will all be rebuilt .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	56	“ In the past , you were proud and made fun of your sister Sodom . But you will not do that again .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	57	You did that before you were punished , before your neighbors started making fun of you . The daughters of Edom [ i ] and Philistia are making fun of you now .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	58	Now you must suffer for the terrible things you did. ” This is what the Lord said . God Remains Faithful
ERV	Ezekiel	16	59	This is what the Lord God said : “ I will treat you like you treated me ! You broke your marriage promise . You did not respect our agreement .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	60	But I will remember the agreement we made when you were young . I made an agreement with you that will continue forever !
ERV	Ezekiel	16	61	I will bring your sisters to you , and I will make them your daughters . That was not in our agreement , but I will do that for you . Then you will remember the terrible things you did , and you will be ashamed .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	62	So I will make my agreement with you , and you will know that I am the Lord .
ERV	Ezekiel	16	63	You will remember me , and you will be so ashamed of the evil things you did that you will not be able to say anything . But I will make you pure , and you will never be ashamed again ! ” This is what the Lord God said . Footnotes - Ezekiel 16:8 spread my clothes over you This showed that he was agreeing to protect her and care for her . See Ruth 3:1-15 . - Ezekiel 16:8 agreement Here , this means the marriage agreement . But it also refers to the agreement God made with the people of Israel . See “ agreement ” in the Word List . - Ezekiel 16:10 Verses 10-13 All the materials in this list are the things used in building the Holy Tent . See Ex . 25-40 . - Ezekiel 16:16 places for worship Or “ high places. ” See “ high place ” in the Word List . Also in verses
ERV	Ezekiel	17	17	The king of Egypt will not be able to save the king of Judah . He might send many soldiers , but Egypt ’ s great power will not save Judah . Nebuchadnezzar ’ s army will build dirt roads and dirt walls to capture the city . Many people will die .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	2	“ Son of man , [ a ] I have a story with a hidden meaning for you to tell the family of Israel .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	3	Tell them that this is what the Lord God says : “ ‘ A large eagle with big wings came to Lebanon . He had feathers covered with spots .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	4	He broke the top out of that big cedar tree and brought it to Canaan . He set the branch down in a city of merchants .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	5	Then the eagle took some of the seeds from Canaan . He planted them in good soil by a good river .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	6	The seeds grew and became a grapevine . It was a good vine . The vine was not tall , but it spread to cover a large area . The vine grew stems , and smaller vines grew very long .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	7	Then another eagle with big wings saw the grapevine . The eagle had many feathers . The grapevine wanted this new eagle to care for it . So it stretched its roots and branches toward the eagle . Its branches stretched toward this eagle . The branches grew away from the field where it was planted . The grapevine wanted the new eagle to water it .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	8	The grapevine was planted in a good field near plenty of water . It could have grown branches and fruit . It could have become a very good grapevine. ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	17	9	This is what the Lord God says : “ Do you think that plant will succeed ? No , the new eagle will pull the plant from the ground , and the bird will break the plant ’ s roots . It will eat up all the grapes . Then the new leaves will wilt . That plant will be very weak . It will not take strong arms or a powerful nation to pull that plant up by the roots .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	10	Will the plant grow where it is planted ? No , the hot east wind will blow , and the plant will become dry and die . It will die there where it was planted. ” King Zedekiah Punished
ERV	Ezekiel	17	11	The word of the Lord came to me . He said ,
ERV	Ezekiel	17	12	“ Explain this story to the people of Israel who always turn against me . Tell them this : The first eagle is the king of Babylonia . He came to Jerusalem and took away the king and other leaders . He brought them to Babylonia .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar made an agreement with a man from the king ’ s family . Nebuchadnezzar forced that man to make a promise . So this man promised to be loyal to Nebuchadnezzar . Nebuchadnezzar made this man the new king of Judah . Then he took all the powerful men away from Judah .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	14	So Judah became a weak kingdom that could not turn against King Nebuchadnezzar . The people were forced to keep the agreement Nebuchadnezzar made with the new king of Judah .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	15	But this new king tried to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar anyway ! He sent messengers to Egypt to ask for help . The new king asked for many horses and soldiers . Now , do you think the new king of Judah will succeed ? Do you think the new king will have enough power to break the agreement and escape punishment ? ”
ERV	Ezekiel	17	16	The Lord God says , “ By my life , I swear that this new king will die in Babylonia ! Nebuchadnezzar made this man the new king of Judah , but he broke his promise with Nebuchadnezzar . This new king ignored that agreement .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	18	But the king of Judah will not escape , because he ignored his agreement . He broke his promise to Nebuchadnezzar. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	17	19	The Lord God makes this promise : “ By my life , I swear that I will punish the king of Judah , because he ignored my warnings and broke our agreement .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	20	I will set my trap , and he will be caught in it . Then I will bring him to Babylon , and I will punish him there . I will punish him because he turned against me ,
ERV	Ezekiel	17	21	and I will destroy his army . I will destroy his best soldiers and scatter them to the wind . Then you will know that I am the Lord and that I told you these things. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	17	22	This is what the Lord God says : “ I will take a branch from a tall cedar tree . I will take a small branch from the top of the tree , and I myself will plant it on a very high mountain .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	23	I myself will plant it on a high mountain in Israel . That branch will grow into a tree . It will grow branches and make fruit and become a beautiful cedar tree . Many birds will sit on its branches and live in the shadows under its branches .
ERV	Ezekiel	17	24	“ Then the other trees will know that I , the Lord , make tall trees fall to the ground , and I make small trees grow tall . I make green trees become dry , and I make dry trees become green . I am the Lord . If I say that I will do something , then I will do it ! ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 17:2 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	18	The father hurts people and steals things . He never does anything good for my people ! He will die because of his own sins .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	2	“ Why do you people say this proverb : ‘ The parents ate the sour grapes , but the children got the sour taste ’ [ a ] ? ”
ERV	Ezekiel	18	3	But the Lord God says , “ By my life , I swear that people in Israel will not think this proverb is true anymore !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	4	I will treat everyone , child and parent , just the same . The one who sins is the one who will die !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	5	“ A person who is good will live ! He is fair and does what is right .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	6	He doesn ’ t go to the mountains to share food offered to idols . He doesn ’ t pray to those filthy idols in Israel . He doesn ’ t commit adultery with his neighbor ’ s wife or with a woman during her period .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	7	He doesn ’ t take advantage of others . If someone borrows money from him , he might take something of value before he gives the money . But when that person pays him back , he returns what he took . He gives food to the hungry and clothes to people who need them .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	8	If someone wants to borrow money from him , he lends the money and doesn ’ t charge interest on the loan . He refuses to be crooked . He is always fair with everyone . People can trust him .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	9	He obeys my laws and studies my rules so that he can learn to be fair and dependable . He is good , so he will live. ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	10	“ But someone like that might have a son who does not do any of these good things . The son steals things and kills people .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	11	He does things his father never did . He goes to the mountains and eats foods offered to false gods . He commits the sin of adultery with his neighbor ’ s wife .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	12	He mistreats poor , helpless people . He takes advantage of them . When a debt is paid , [ b ] he does not give back what he took from them . He prays to filthy idols and does other terrible things .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	13	He lends money to people who need it , but he forces them to pay interest on the loan . The evil son will not be allowed to live . He will be put to death because he did such terrible things , and he will be responsible for his own death .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	14	“ Now , that evil son might also have a son . But this son sees the bad things his father did , and he refuses to live as his father did . He treats people fairly .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	15	He does not go to the mountains and eat foods offered to false gods . He does not pray to filthy idols in Israel . He does not commit the sin of adultery with his neighbor ’ s wife .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	16	He does not take advantage of people . If someone borrows money from him , the good son takes something of value and then gives the other person the money . When that person pays him back , the good son gives back what he took . The good son gives food to hungry people , and he gives clothes to those who need them .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	17	He helps the poor . If people want to borrow money , the good son lends them the money , and he does not charge interest on the loan . He obeys my laws and follows them . He will not be put to death for his father ’ s sins . The good son will live .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	19	“ You might ask , ‘ Why will the son not be punished for his father ’ s sins ? ’ The reason is that the son was fair and did good things . He very carefully obeyed my laws , so he will live .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	20	The one who sins is the one who will be put to death . A son will not be punished for his father ’ s sins , and a father will not be punished for his son ’ s sins . A good man ’ s goodness belongs to him alone , and a bad man ’ s evil belongs to him alone .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	21	“ Now , if evil people change their lives , they will live and not die . They might stop doing all the bad things they did and begin to carefully obey all my laws . They might become fair and good .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	22	God will not remember all the bad things they did . He will remember only their goodness , so they will live ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	18	23	The Lord God says , “ I don ’ t want evil people to die . I want them to change their lives so that they can live !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	24	“ Now , maybe good people might stop being good . They might change their lives and begin to do all the terrible things that evil people have done in the past . ( The evil people changed , so they can live . ) So if those good people change and become bad , God will not remember all the good things they did . He will remember that they turned against him and began to sin . So they will die because of their sin .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	25	“ You people might say , ‘ The Lord isn ’ t fair ! ’ But listen , family of Israel . I am fair . You are the ones who are not fair !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	26	If good people change and become evil , they must die for the bad things they do .
ERV	Ezekiel	18	27	And if evil people change and become good and fair , they will save their lives . They will live !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	28	They saw how wicked they were and came back to me . They stopped doing the evil things they did in the past . So they will live ! They will not die ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	18	29	The people of Israel said , “ That ’ s not fair ! The Lord isn ’ t fair ! ” “ I am fair ! You are the ones who are not fair !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	30	Why ? Because , family of Israel , I will judge each of you only for what you do ! ” This is what the Lord God said . “ So come back to me ! Stop committing those crimes and do away with those things that cause you to sin !
ERV	Ezekiel	18	31	Throw away all the terrible idols with which you committed your crimes ! Change your heart and spirit . People of Israel , why should you do things that will cost you your life ?
ERV	Ezekiel	18	32	I don ’ t want to kill you ! Please come back and live ! ” This is what the Lord God said .

ERV	Ezekiel	19	19	The Lord said to me , “ You must sing this sad song about the leaders of Israel :
ERV	Ezekiel	19	2	“ ‘ Your mother is like a female lion , lying there with the male lions . She went to lie down with the young male lions and had many babies .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	3	One of her cubs gets up . He has grown to be a strong young lion . He has learned to catch his food . He killed and ate a man .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	4	“ ‘ The people heard him roar , and they caught him in their trap . They put hooks in his mouth and carried the young lion to Egypt .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	5	“ ‘ The mother lion had hoped that cub would become the leader , but now she has lost all hope . So she took another of her cubs and trained him to be a lion .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	6	He hunted with the adult lions and became a strong young lion . He learned to catch his food . He killed and ate a man .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	7	He attacked the palaces and destroyed the cities . Everyone in that country was too afraid to speak when hearing his growl .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	8	Then the people who lived around him set a trap for him , and they caught him in their trap .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	9	They put hooks on him and locked him up . They had him in their trap , so they took him to the king of Babylon . And now , you can not hear his roar on the mountains of Israel .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	10	“ ‘ Your mother is like a grapevine planted near the water . She had plenty of water , so she grew many strong vines .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	11	Then she grew large branches . They were like a strong walking stick . They were like a king ’ s scepter . The vine grew taller and taller . It had many branches and reached to the clouds .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	12	But the vine was pulled up by the roots , and thrown down to the ground . The hot east wind blew and dried its fruit . The strong branches broke , and they were thrown into the fire .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	13	“ ‘ Now that grapevine is planted in the desert . It is a very dry and thirsty land .
ERV	Ezekiel	19	14	A fire started in the large branch and spread to destroy all of its vines and fruit . So there was no strong walking stick . There was no king ’ s scepter. ’ This was a sad song about death , and it was sung as a sad song about death . ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	20	Show that my days of rest are important to you . Remember , they are a special sign between us . I am the Lord , and these days show you that I am your God. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	2	Then the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,
ERV	Ezekiel	20	3	“ Son of man , [ b ] speak to the elders of Israel . Tell them ‘ This is what the Lord God says : Have you come to ask me what you should do ? I , the Lord God , tell you that , as surely as I live , I will not listen to you. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	20	4	,
ERV	Ezekiel	20	5	You must tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : On the day I chose Israel , I raised my hand to Jacob ’ s family and made a promise to them in Egypt . When I let them know who I was , I raised my hand and said , “ I am the Lord your God. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	6	On that day I promised to take you out of Egypt and lead you to the land I was giving to you . That was a good land filled with many good things . [ c ] It was the most beautiful of all countries !
ERV	Ezekiel	20	7	“ ‘ I told the family of Israel to throw away their horrible idols . I told them not to become filthy with those filthy statues from Egypt . I said , “ I am the Lord your God. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	8	But they turned against me and refused to listen to me . They did not throw away their horrible idols . They did not leave their filthy statues in Egypt . So I decided to destroy them in Egypt—to let them feel the full force of my anger .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	9	But I did not destroy them . I had already told the Egyptians that I would bring my people out of Egypt . I did not want to ruin my good name , so I did not destroy Israel in front of those other people .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	10	I brought the family of Israel out of Egypt . I led them into the desert .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	11	Then I gave them my laws and told them all my rules . All those who obey them will live .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	12	I also told them about all the special days of rest , which were a special sign between us . They showed that I am the Lord and that I was making them special to me .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	13	“ ‘ But the family of Israel turned against me in the desert . They did not follow my laws . They refused to obey my rules—even though people who obey my laws live because of them . They treated my special days of rest as if they were not important . They worked on those days many times . I decided to destroy them in the desert—to let them feel the full force of my anger .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	14	But I did not destroy them . The other nations saw me bring Israel out of Egypt . I did not want to ruin my good name , so I did not destroy Israel in front of those other people .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	15	. - Ezekiel 20:28 anger offerings The people called these meals “ fellowship offerings , ” but Ezekiel is making fun of them and saying that those meals only made God angry . - Ezekiel 20:29 But that … today Literally , “ And its name is still called Bamah ( high place ) to this day. ” - Ezekiel 20:46 Negev Forest God is probably making fun of the people . The Negev is a desert area . There are no forests in the Negev .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	16	“ ‘ The people of Israel refused to obey my rules or to follow my laws . They treated my days of rest as if they were not important . They did all these things because their hearts belonged to their filthy idols .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	17	But I felt sorry for them , so I did not destroy them . I did not completely destroy them in the desert .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	18	I spoke to their children and told them , “ Don ’ t be like your parents . Don ’ t make yourselves filthy with their filthy idols . Don ’ t follow their laws or obey their commands .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	19	I am the Lord . I am your God . Obey my laws and keep my commands . Do the things I tell you .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	21	“ ‘ But the children turned against me and did not obey my laws . They did not keep my commands—even though people who obey my laws live because of them . They treated my special days of rest as though they were not important . So I decided to destroy them completely in the desert—to let them feel the full force of my anger .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	22	But I stopped myself . The other nations saw me bring Israel out of Egypt . I did not want to ruin my good name , so I did not destroy Israel in front of those other people .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	23	So I made another promise to those people in the desert . I promised to scatter them among the nations , to send them to many different countries .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	24	“ ‘ The people of Israel did not obey my commands . They refused to obey my laws . They treated my special days of rest as though they were not important , and they worshiped the filthy idols of their fathers .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	25	So I gave them laws that were not good . I gave them commands that would not bring life .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	26	I let them make themselves filthy with their gifts . They even began to sacrifice their own firstborn children . In this way I would destroy them . Then they would know that I am the Lord. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	20	27	,
ERV	Ezekiel	20	28	But I still brought them to the land I promised to give them . They saw all the hills and green trees , so they went to all those places to worship . They took their sacrifices and anger offerings [ d ] to all those places . They offered their sacrifices that made a sweet smell , and they offered their drink offerings at those places .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	29	I asked the people of Israel why they were going to the high places . But that high place is still there today . [ e ] ’
ERV	Ezekiel	20	30	“ Since Israel did those things , speak to them and tell them , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : You people have made yourselves filthy by doing the things your ancestors did . You have acted like a prostitute . You have left me to be with the horrible gods your ancestors worshiped .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	31	You are giving the same kind of gifts . You are putting your children in the fire as a gift to your false gods . You are still making yourself filthy with these filthy idols today ! Do you really think that I should let you come to me and ask me for advice ? I am the Lord God . By my life , I swear that I will not answer your questions or give you advice !
ERV	Ezekiel	20	32	You keep saying you want to be like the other nations . You live like the people in other nations . You serve pieces of wood and stone idols ! ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	33	The Lord God says , “ By my life , I swear that I will rule over you as king . But I will raise my powerful arm and punish you . I will show my anger against you !
ERV	Ezekiel	20	34	I will bring you out of these other nations . I scattered you among these nations , but I will gather you together and bring you back from these countries . But I will raise my powerful arm and punish you . I will show my anger against you !
ERV	Ezekiel	20	35	I will lead you into a desert as I did before , but this will be a place where other nations live . We will stand face to face , and I will judge you .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	36	I will judge you as I judged your ancestors in the desert near Egypt. ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	37	“ I will judge you guilty and punish you according to the agreement .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	38	I will remove all those who turned against me and sinned against me . I will remove them from your homeland . They will never again come to the land of Israel . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	39	Now , family of Israel , this is what the Lord God says : “ Whoever wants to worship their filthy idols , let them go and worship them . But later , don ’ t think you will get any advice from me . You will not ruin my name anymore—not when you continue to give your gifts to your filthy idols ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	20	40	The Lord God says , “ People must come to my holy mountain—the high mountain in Israel—to serve me ! The whole family of Israel will be on their land ; they will be there in their country . There you can come to ask me for advice , and you must come there to bring me your offerings . You must bring the first part of your crops to me there . You must bring all your holy gifts to me in that place .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	41	Then I will be pleased with the sweet smell of your sacrifices . That will happen when I bring you back . I scattered you among many nations , but I will gather you together and make you my special people again . And all the nations will see it .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	42	Then you will know that I am the Lord . You will know this when I bring you back to the land of Israel , the land I promised to give to your ancestors .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	43	In that country you will remember all the evil things you did that made you filthy , and you will be ashamed .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	44	Family of Israel , you did many evil things , and you should be destroyed because of them . But to protect my good name , I will not give you the punishment you really deserve . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	45	Then the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,

The fire will destroy every green tree and every dry tree . The flame that burns will not be put out . All the land from south to north will be burned by the fire .
ERV	Ezekiel	20	48	Then all people will see that I , the Lord , have started the fire . The fire will not be put out ! ’ ”

All hands will become weak . Every spirit will become weak . All knees will be like water. ’ Look , that bad news is coming . These things will happen ! ” This is what the Lord God said . The Sword Is Ready
ERV	Ezekiel	21	8	The word of the Lord came to me . He said ,
ERV	Ezekiel	21	9	,
ERV	Ezekiel	21	10	The sword was made sharp for killing . It was polished to flash like lightning . My son , you ran away from the stick I used to punish you . You refused to be punished with that wooden stick .

ERV	Ezekiel	21	12	,

They will build a wall of dirt around the city and a dirt road leading up to the walls . They will build wooden towers to attack the city .
ERV	Ezekiel	21	23	But the people in Jerusalem will think this is all a big mistake . They will not believe that this could happen , because they had made a peace agreement with Babylon ’ s king . But the king will remind them that they are guilty of breaking that agreement , and he will take them captive. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	21	24	This is what the Lord God says : “ You have done many evil things . Your sins are very clear . You forced me to remember that you are guilty , so the enemy will catch you in his hand .
ERV	Ezekiel	21	25	And you , evil leader of Israel , you will be killed . Your time of punishment has come ! The end is here ! ”

ERV	Ezekiel	22	25	The prophets in Jerusalem are making evil plans . They are like a lion—it roars when it begins to eat the animal it caught . They have destroyed many lives . They have taken many valuable things and made widows of many of the women in Jerusalem .

Footnotes - Ezekiel 22:2 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel . Also in verses
ERV	Ezekiel	23	23	I will bring all the men from Babylon , especially the Chaldeans . I will bring the men from Pekod , Shoa , and Koa , and all the men from Assyria . I will bring all the leaders and officers , all those desirable young men , chariot officers , and handpicked soldiers riding their horses .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	2	“ Son of man , [ a ] listen to this story about Samaria and Jerusalem . There were two sisters , daughters of the same mother .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	3	They became prostitutes in Egypt while they were still young girls . That ’ s where they first let men touch and handle their young breasts .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	4	The older daughter was named Oholah , [ b ] and her sister was named Oholibah . [ c ] They became my wives , and we had children . I am using the name Oholah to mean Samaria and the name Oholibah to mean Jerusalem .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	5	“ Then Oholah became unfaithful to me—she began to live like a prostitute . She began to want her lovers . She saw the Assyrian soldiers
ERV	Ezekiel	23	6	in their blue uniforms . They were all handsome young men riding horses . They were leaders and officers ,
ERV	Ezekiel	23	7	and Oholah gave herself to all those men . All of them were handpicked soldiers in the Assyrian army , and she wanted them all ! She became filthy with their filthy idols .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	8	Besides that , she never stopped her love affair with Egypt . Egypt made love to her when she was a young girl . Egypt was the first lover to touch her young breasts . Egypt poured his untrue love on her .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	9	So I let her lovers have her . She wanted Assyria , so I gave her to them !
ERV	Ezekiel	23	10	They raped [ d ] her . They took her children and killed her . They punished her , and women still talk about her .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	11	“ Her younger sister Oholibah saw all these things happen . But Oholibah sinned more than her sister did ! She was more unfaithful than Oholah .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	12	She wanted the Assyrian leaders and officers . She wanted those soldiers in blue uniforms riding their horses . They were all handsome young men .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	13	I saw that both women were going to ruin their lives with the same mistakes .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	14	“ Oholibah continued to be unfaithful to me . In Babylon , she saw pictures of men carved on the walls . These were pictures of Chaldean men wearing their red uniforms .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	15	They wore belts around their waists and long turbans on their heads . All those men looked like chariot officers . They all looked like native-born Babylonian men ,
ERV	Ezekiel	23	16	and Oholibah wanted them .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	17	So the Babylonian men came to her bed to have sex with her . They used her and made her so filthy that she became disgusted with them .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	18	,
ERV	Ezekiel	23	19	But Oholibah thought about her time as a prostitute in Egypt when she was young , and she turned to even more prostitution .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	20	She remembered the lovers who excited her there , who were like animals in their sexual desires and abilities .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	21	. - Ezekiel 23:10 raped Literally , “ revealed her nakedness. ” The Hebrew word meaning “ revealed ” is like the word meaning “ carried away as a prisoner to a faraway country. ” - Ezekiel 23:31 You , yourself … your hands Or “ I put her cup in your hands. ” - Ezekiel 23:41 my incense A special blend of spices that were burned as a gift to God . This special incense was to be burned only in the Temple . See Ex . 30:34-38 . - Ezekiel 23:41 my oil The special oil that was used for anointing priests and things in the Temple to make them holy ( special ) . See Ex . 30:22-33 . - Ezekiel 23:42 party The Hebrew word is like the word for a fellowship offering , a time when people came to share a meal and enjoy themselves together with the Lord . Here , it seems this time of worship turned into a wild party . See Deut . 14:22-29 ; 26:1-15 .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	22	So Oholibah , this is what the Lord God says : ‘ You became disgusted with your lovers , but I will bring them here , and they will surround you .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	24	That crowd of men will come to you in large groups , riding on their horses and in their chariots . They will have their spears , shields , and helmets . They will gather around you , and I will tell them what you have done to me . Then they will punish you their own way .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	25	I will show you how jealous I am . They will become angry and hurt you . They will cut off your nose and ears . They will kill you with a sword . Then they will take your children and burn whatever is left of you .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	26	They will take your nice clothes and jewelry .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	27	So I will stop your dreams about your love affair with Egypt . You will never again look for them . You will never remember Egypt again ! ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	23	28	This is what the Lord God says : “ I am giving you to the men you hate . I am giving you to the men you became disgusted with .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	29	And they will show how much they hate you ! They will take everything you worked for , and they will leave you bare and naked ! People will clearly see your sins . They will see that you acted like a prostitute and dreamed wicked dreams .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	30	You did those bad things when you left me to chase after the other nations . You did those bad things when you began to worship their filthy idols .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	31	You followed your sister and lived as she did . You , yourself , took her cup of poison and held it in your hands . [ e ] ”
ERV	Ezekiel	23	32	This is what the Lord God says : “ You will drink your sister ’ s cup of poison . It is a tall , wide cup of poison . It holds much poison . People will laugh at you and make fun of you .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	33	You will stagger like a drunk . You will become very dizzy . That is the cup of destruction and devastation . It is like the cup of punishment that your sister drank .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	34	You will drink the poison in that cup . You will drink it to the last drop . You will throw down the glass and break it to pieces . You will tear at your breasts from the pain . This will happen because I am the Lord God , and this is what I said .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	35	“ So this is what the Lord God said : ‘ Jerusalem , you forgot me . You threw me away and left me behind . So now you must suffer for leaving me and living like a prostitute . You must suffer for your wicked dreams. ’ ” Judgment Against Oholah and Oholibah
ERV	Ezekiel	23	36	. - Ezekiel 23:4 Oholah This name means “ Tent. ” It probably refers to the Holy Tent where the people of Israel went to worship God . - Ezekiel 23:4 Oholibah This name means “ My Tent is in her country. ” Also in verses
ERV	Ezekiel	23	37	They committed the sin of adultery . They are guilty of murder . They acted like prostitutes—they left me to be with their filthy idols . They had my children , but they forced them to pass through fire . They did this to give food to their filthy idols .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	38	They also treated my special days of rest and my holy place as though they were not important .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	39	They killed their children for their idols , and then they went into my holy place and made it filthy too ! They did this inside my Temple !
ERV	Ezekiel	23	40	“ They have sent for men from faraway places . You sent a messenger to these men , and they came to see you . You bathed for them , painted your eyes , and put on your jewelry .
ERV	Ezekiel	23	41	You sat on a fine bed with a table set before it . You put my incense [ f ] and my oil [ g ] on this table .

ERV	Ezekiel	35	2	“ Son of man , [ a ] look toward Mount Seir and speak against it for me .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	3	Say to it , ‘ This is what the Lord God says : “ ‘ I am against you , Mount Seir ! I will punish you and make you an empty wasteland .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	4	I will destroy your cities , and you will become empty . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	5	“ ‘ Why ? Because you have always been against my people . You used your sword against Israel at the time of their trouble , at the time of their final punishment. ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	35	6	So the Lord God says , “ But I promise by my own life that I will let death have you . Death will chase you . You did not hate killing people , so death will chase you .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	7	I will make Mount Seir an empty ruin . I will kill everyone who enters or leaves that city .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	8	I will cover its mountains with those who are killed . There will be dead bodies all over your hills , in your valleys , and in all your ravines .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	9	I will make you empty forever . No one will live in your cities . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	35	10	You said , “ These two nations and countries , Israel and Judah , will be mine . We will take them for our own. ” But the Lord is there !
ERV	Ezekiel	35	11	And the Lord God says , “ You were jealous of my people . You were angry and hateful to them . So by my life , I swear that I will punish you the same way you hurt them ! I will punish you and let my people know that I am with them .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	12	And then you , too , will know that I am the Lord . “ I have heard you making fun of Israel ’ s hill country . You said , ‘ It is in ruins , just waiting for us to swallow it up. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	35	13	Your proud boasting is really against me . Time after time you have insulted me , and I have heard every word. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	35	14	This is what the Lord God says : “ All the earth will be happy when I destroy you .
ERV	Ezekiel	35	15	You were happy when the country of Israel was destroyed . I will treat you the same way . Mount Seir and the whole country of Edom will be destroyed . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 35:2 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	36	“ Then the nations that are still around you will know I am the Lord and that I rebuilt those places . I planted things in this land that was empty . I am the Lord . I said this , and I will make them happen ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	2	Tell them that this is what the Lord God says : ‘ The enemy said bad things against you . They said , Hurray ! Now the ancient mountains [ b ] will be ours ! ’
ERV	Ezekiel	36	3	“ So speak to the mountains of Israel for me . Tell them that this is what the Lord God says : ‘ The enemy destroyed your cities and attacked you from every direction . They did this so that you would belong to the other nations . Then people talked and whispered about you. ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	4	So , mountains of Israel , listen to the word of the Lord God ! This is what the Lord God says to the mountains , hills , streams , valleys , empty ruins , and abandoned cities that have been looted and laughed at by the other nations around them .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	5	The Lord God says , “ I swear , I will let my strong feelings speak for me ! I will let Edom and the other nations feel my anger . They took my land for themselves . They really had a good time when they showed how much they hated this land . They took the land for themselves , just so they could destroy it. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	6	“ So say these things about the land of Israel . Speak to the mountains and to the hills , to the streams , and to the valleys . Tell them that this is what the Lord God says : ‘ I will let my strong feelings and anger speak for me , because you had to suffer the insults from those nations. ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	7	So this is what the Lord God says : “ I am the one making this promise ! I swear that the nations around you will have to suffer for those insults .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	8	“ But mountains of Israel , you will grow new trees and produce fruit for my people Israel . My people will soon come back .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	9	I am with you , and I will help you . People will till your soil and plant seeds in you .

ERV	Ezekiel	36	11	I will give you many people and animals , and they will grow and have many children . I will bring people to live on you as in the past . I will make it better for you than before . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	12	Yes , I will lead many people—my people , Israel—to your land . You will be their property , and you will not take away their children again. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	13	This is what the Lord God says : “ Land of Israel , people say bad things to you . They say you destroyed your people . They say you took the children away from your people .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	14	But you will not destroy people anymore or take away their children again. ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	15	“ I will not let those other nations insult you anymore . You will not be hurt by them anymore . You will not take the children away from your people again. ” This is what the Lord God said . The Lord Will Protect His Name
ERV	Ezekiel	36	16	Then the word of the Lord came to me . He said ,
ERV	Ezekiel	36	17	. - Ezekiel 36:2 mountains Literally , “ high places , ” usually a reference to places of worship . See “ high place ” in the Word List . - Ezekiel 36:27 I will put my Spirit inside you Or “ I will make my Spirit live among you . ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	18	They spilled blood on the ground when they murdered people in the land . They made the land filthy with their idols , so I showed them how angry I was .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	19	I scattered them among the nations and spread them through all the lands . I gave them the punishment they deserved for the bad things they did .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	20	But even in those other nations , they ruined my good name . How ? Those nations said , ‘ These are the Lord ’ s people , but they left his land. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	36	21	“ The people of Israel ruined my holy name wherever they went , and I felt sorry for my name .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	22	So tell the family of Israel that this is what the Lord God says : ‘ Family of Israel , you ruined my holy name in the places where you went . I am going to do something to stop this . I will not do it for your sake , Israel . I will do it for my holy name .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	23	I will show the nations how holy my great name really is . You ruined my good name in those nations ! But I will show you that I am holy . I will make you respect my name , and then those nations will know that I am the Lord. ’ ” This is what the Lord God said .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	24	“ I will take you out of those nations , gather you together , and bring you back to your own land .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	25	Then I will sprinkle pure water on you and make you pure . I will wash away all your filth , the filth from those nasty idols , and I will make you pure .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	26	I will also put a new spirit in you to change your way of thinking . I will take out the heart of stone from your body and give you a tender , human heart .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	27	I will put my Spirit inside you [ c ] and change you so that you will obey my laws . You will carefully obey my commands .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	28	Then you will live in the land that I gave to your ancestors . You will be my people , and I will be your God .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	29	Also , I will save you and keep you from becoming unclean . I will command the grain to grow . I will not bring a famine against you .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	30	I will give you large crops of fruit from your trees and the harvest from your fields so that you will never again feel the shame of being hungry in a foreign country .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	31	You will remember the bad things you did . You will remember that those things were not good . Then you will hate yourselves because of your sins and the terrible things you did. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	32	The Lord God says , “ I want you to remember this : I am not doing these things for your good ! I am doing them for my good name . Family of Israel , you should be ashamed and embarrassed about the way you lived ! ”
ERV	Ezekiel	36	33	This is what the Lord God says : “ On the day that I wash away your sins , I will bring people back to your cities . The ruined cities will be rebuilt .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	34	People will begin again to work the land so when other people pass by they will not see ruins anymore .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	35	They will say , ‘ In the past , this land was ruined , but now it is like the Garden of Eden . The cities were destroyed . They were ruined and empty , but now they are protected , and there are people living in them. ’
ERV	Ezekiel	36	37	This is what the Lord God says : “ I will also let the family of Israel come to me and ask me to do these things for them . I will make them grow and become many people . They will be like flocks of sheep .
ERV	Ezekiel	36	38	During the special festivals , Jerusalem was filled with flocks of sheep and goats that had been made holy . In the same way the cities and ruined places will be filled with flocks of people . Then they will know that I am the Lord. ” Footnotes - Ezekiel 36:1 Son of man This was usually just a way of saying “ a person ” or “ a human being. ” Here , it is a way of addressing Ezekiel .

ERV	Ezekiel	37	2	There were many bones lying on the ground in the valley . The Lord made me walk all around among the bones . I saw the bones were very dry .
ERV	Ezekiel	37	3	Then the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , [ c ] can these bones come to life ? ” I answered , “ Lord God , only you know the answer to that question. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	37	4	Then he said to me , “ Speak to these bones for me . Tell them , ‘ Dry bones , listen to the word of the Lord !
ERV	Ezekiel	37	5	This is what the Lord God says to you : I will cause breath [ d ] to come into you , and you will come to life !
ERV	Ezekiel	37	6	I will put sinew and muscles on you , and I will cover you with skin . Then I will put breath in you , and you will come back to life ! Then you will know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
ERV	Ezekiel	37	7	So I spoke to the bones for the Lord , as he said . I was still speaking , when I heard the loud noise . The bones began to rattle , and bone joined together with bone !
ERV	Ezekiel	37	8	There before my eyes , I saw sinew and muscles begin to cover the bones . Skin began to cover them , but there was no breath in them .

People must not return the same way they entered . Each person must go out straight ahead .

ERV	Ezekiel	46	16	This is what the Lord God says : “ If the ruler gives a gift from part of his land to any of his sons , it will belong to his sons . It is their property .
ERV	Ezekiel	46	17	But if the ruler gives a gift from part of his land to one of his slaves , the gift will belong to the slave only until the year of freedom . [ c ] Then the gift will go back to the ruler . Only the ruler ’ s sons will keep a gift of land from the ruler .
ERV	Ezekiel	46	18	And the ruler will not take any of the people ’ s land or force them to leave their land . He must give some of his own land to his sons . In that way my people will not be forced to lose their land. ” The Special Kitchens
ERV	Ezekiel	46	19	The man led me through the entrance at the side of the gate . He led me to the holy rooms for the priests on the north side . There I saw a place at the west end of the path .
ERV	Ezekiel	46	20	The man said to me , “ This is where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and will bake the grain offering . Why ? So they will not need to bring these offerings out into the outer courtyard . So they will not bring those holy things out where the common people are. ”
ERV	Ezekiel	46	21	Then the man led me out to the outer courtyard . He led me to the four corners of the courtyard . I saw smaller courtyards in each corner of the large courtyard .
ERV	Ezekiel	46	22	There was a small , enclosed area in each of the four corners of the courtyard . Each small courtyard was

ERV	Ezekiel	47	7	As I walked back along the side of the river , I saw many trees on both sides of the water .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	8	He said to me , “ This water flows east , down to the Arabah Valley .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	9	This water flows into the Dead Sea so that the water in that sea becomes fresh and clean . There are many fish in this water , and all kinds of animals live where this river goes .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	10	You can see fishermen standing by the river all the way from En Gedi to En Eglaim . You can see them throwing their fishing nets and catching many kinds of fish . There are as many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea as there are in the Mediterranean Sea .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	11	But the swamps and small marshes will not become fresh . They will be left for salt .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	12	All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both sides of the river . Their leaves never will become dry and fall . The fruit will never stop growing on those trees . The trees will produce fruit every month , because the water for the trees comes from the Temple . The fruit from the trees will be for food , and their leaves will be for healing. ” Division of the Land for the Tribes
ERV	Ezekiel	47	13	This is what the Lord God says : “ These are the borders for dividing the land among the twelve tribes of Israel . Joseph will have two parts .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	14	You will divide the land equally . I promised to give this land to your ancestors , so I am giving this land to you .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	15	“ These are the borders of the land : On the north side , it goes from the Mediterranean Sea by way of Hethlon where the road turns toward Hamath and on to Zedad ,
ERV	Ezekiel	47	16	Berothah , Sibraim ( which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath ) and Hazer Hatticon , which is on the border of Hauran .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	17	So the border will go from the sea to Hazar Enan on the northern border of Damascus and Hamath . This will be on the north side .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	18	“ On the east side , the border will go from Hazar Enan between Hauran and Damascus and continue along the Jordan River between Gilead and the land of Israel , to the eastern sea and all the way to Tamar . This will be the eastern border .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	19	“ On the south side , the border will go from Tamar all the way to the oasis at Meribah-kadesh . Then it will go along the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea . This will be the southern border .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	20	“ On the west side , the Mediterranean Sea will be the border all the way to the area in front of Lebo Hamath . This will be your western border .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	21	“ So you will divide this land among you for the tribes of Israel .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	22	You will divide it as a property for yourselves and for the foreigners who live among you and who have had children among you . These foreigners will be residents—they will be like natural born Israelites . You will divide some land for them among the tribes of Israel .
ERV	Ezekiel	47	23	The tribe where that resident lives must give him some land. ” This is what the Lord God said ! Footnotes - Ezekiel 47:3
ERV	Ezekiel	48	48	“ The northern border goes east from the Mediterranean Sea to Hethlon to Hamath Pass and then all the way to Hazar Enan . This is on the border between Damascus and Hamath . The land for the tribes in this group will go from the east of these borders to the west . From north to south , the tribes in this area are Dan , Asher , Naphtali , Manasseh , Ephraim , Reuben , and Judah . The Special Section of Land
ERV	Ezekiel	48	8	“ The next area of land will be for a special use . This land is south of Judah ’ s land . This area is 25,000 cubits [ a ] long from north to south . From east to west , it will be as wide as the land that belongs to the other tribes . The Temple will be in the middle of this section of land .
ERV	Ezekiel	48	9	,

The land will be 25,000 cubits long on the north side , 10,000 cubits [ c ] wide on the west side , 10,000 cubits wide on the east side , and 25,000 cubits long on the south side . The Lord ’ s Temple will be in the middle of this area of land .
ERV	Ezekiel	48	11	This land is for Zadok ’ s descendants . These men were chosen to be my holy priests , because they continued to serve me when the other people of Israel left me . Zadok ’ s family did not leave me like the other people from the tribe of Levi .
ERV	Ezekiel	48	12	This share from this holy part of the land will be especially for these priests . It will be next to the land of the Levites .
ERV	Ezekiel	48	13	,
ERV	Ezekiel	48	14	The Levites will not sell or trade any of this land . They will not be able to sell any of it . They must not cut up this part of the country , because this land belongs to the Lord—it is very special . It is the best part of the land . The Shares for the City Property

ERV	Daniel	1	1	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and surrounded it with his army . This happened during the third year that Jehoiakim [ a ] was king of Judah .
ERV	Daniel	1	2	The Lord allowed Nebuchadnezzar to defeat Jehoiakim king of Judah . Nebuchadnezzar took all the dishes and other things from God ’ s Temple and carried them to Babylon . [ b ] He put those things in the temple of his gods .
ERV	Daniel	1	3	Then King Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz , the man in charge of his officials , to bring some of the boys into the palace to train them . He was to include boys from among the Israelites , [ c ] from important Judean families , and from the royal family of Judah .
ERV	Daniel	1	4	King Nebuchadnezzar wanted only healthy boys who did not have any bruises , scars , or anything wrong with their bodies . He wanted handsome , smart young men who were able to learn things quickly and easily to serve in his palace . He told Ashpenaz to teach these young men the language and writings of the Chaldeans .
ERV	Daniel	1	5	King Nebuchadnezzar gave the young men a certain amount of food and wine every day . This was the same kind of food that he ate . He wanted them to be trained for three years . After that they would become servants of the king of Babylon .
ERV	Daniel	1	6	Among those young men were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah from the tribe of Judah .
ERV	Daniel	1	7	Ashpenaz gave them Babylonian names . Daniel ’ s new name was Belteshazzar , Hananiah ’ s was Shadrach , Mishael ’ s was Meshach , and Azariah ’ s was Abednego .
ERV	Daniel	1	8	Daniel did not want to eat the king ’ s rich food and wine because it would make him unclean . So he asked Ashpenaz for permission not to make himself unclean in this way .
ERV	Daniel	1	9	God caused Ashpenaz , the man in charge of the officials , to be kind and loyal to Daniel .
ERV	Daniel	1	10	But Ashpenaz told Daniel , “ I am afraid of my master , the king . He ordered me to give you this food and drink . If you don ’ t eat this food , you will begin to look weak and sick . You will look worse than other young men your age . The king will see this , and he will become angry with me . He might cut off my head . And it would be your fault. ”
ERV	Daniel	1	11	Then Daniel talked to the guard who had been put in charge of Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah by Ashpenaz .
ERV	Daniel	1	12	He said , “ Please give us this test for ten days : Don ’ t give us anything but vegetables to eat and water to drink .
ERV	Daniel	1	13	Then after ten days , compare us with the other young men who eat the king ’ s food . See for yourself who looks healthier , and then decide how you want to treat us , your servants. ”
ERV	Daniel	1	14	So the guard agreed to test Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah for ten days .
ERV	Daniel	1	15	After ten days , Daniel and his friends looked healthier than all the young men who ate the king ’ s food .
ERV	Daniel	1	16	So the guard continued to take away the king ’ s special food and wine and to give only vegetables to Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
ERV	Daniel	1	17	God gave these four young men the wisdom and ability to learn many different kinds of writing and science . Daniel could also understand all kinds of visions and dreams .
ERV	Daniel	1	18	At the end of the three years of training , Ashpenaz brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar .
ERV	Daniel	1	19	The king talked to them and found that none of the young men were as good as Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah . So these four young men became the king ’ s servants .
ERV	Daniel	1	20	Every time the king asked them about something important , they showed great wisdom and understanding . The king found they were ten times better than all the magicians and wise men in his kingdom .
ERV	Daniel	1	21	So Daniel served the king until the first year that Cyrus [ d ] was king . Footnotes - Daniel 1:1 the third year … Jehoiakim This was about
ERV	Daniel	1	605	B.C . - Daniel 1:2 Babylon Literally , “ Shinar , ” which may be a form of the name Sumer . - Daniel 1:3 Israelites Here , this probably means “ ordinary citizens of Judah and Israel. ” But it could mean “ people from the northern tribes of Israel. ” - Daniel 1:21 the first year … Cyrus This was about 539–538 B.C .
ERV	Daniel	2	2	So the king called his wise men to come to him . They used magic and watched the stars . They did this to try to interpret dreams and to learn what would happen in the future . The king wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed , so they came in and stood in front of him .
ERV	Daniel	2	3	Then the king said to them , “ I had a dream that bothers me . I want to know what it means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	4	Then the Chaldeans answered the king . They spoke Aramaic [ a ] and said , “ King , live forever ! Please tell your dream to us , your servants , and then we will tell you what it means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	5	Then King Nebuchadnezzar said to them , “ No , you must tell me the dream , and then you must tell me what it means . If you don ’ t , I will give an order for you to be cut into pieces . And I will order your houses to be destroyed until they are nothing but piles of dust and ashes .
ERV	Daniel	2	6	But if you tell me my dream and explain its meaning , I will give you gifts , rewards , and great honor . So tell me about my dream and what it means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	7	Again the wise men said to the king , “ Please , Sir , tell us about the dream , and we will tell you what it means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	8	Then King Nebuchadnezzar answered , “ I know that you are trying to get more time . You know that I meant what I said .
ERV	Daniel	2	9	You know that you will be punished if you don ’ t tell me about my dream . So you have all agreed to lie to me . You are hoping for more time so that I will forget what I want you to do . Now tell me the dream . If you can tell me the dream , I will know that you can tell me what it really means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	10	The Chaldeans answered the king . They said , “ There is not a man on earth who can do what the king is asking ! No king has ever asked the wise men , the men who do magic , or the Chaldeans to do something like this . Not even the greatest and most powerful king has ever asked his wise men to do such a thing .
ERV	Daniel	2	11	The king is asking something that is too hard to do . Only the gods could tell the king his dream and what it means . But the gods don ’ t live with people. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	12	When the king heard that , he became very angry . So he gave an order for all the wise men of Babylon to be killed .
ERV	Daniel	2	13	King Nebuchadnezzar ’ s order to kill all the wise men was announced . The king ’ s men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to kill them .
ERV	Daniel	2	14	Arioch was the commander of the king ’ s guards . He was going to kill the wise men of Babylon , but Daniel talked to him . Daniel spoke politely to Arioch
ERV	Daniel	2	15	and said , “ Why did the king order such a severe punishment ? ” Then Arioch explained the whole story about the king ’ s dreams , and Daniel understood .
ERV	Daniel	2	16	When Daniel heard the story , he went to King Nebuchadnezzar . Daniel asked the king to give him some more time . Then he would tell the king what the dream meant .
ERV	Daniel	2	17	So Daniel went to his house . He explained the whole story to his friends Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
ERV	Daniel	2	18	Daniel asked his friends to pray to the God of heaven that God would be kind to them and help them understand this secret . Then Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the other wise men of Babylon .
ERV	Daniel	2	19	During the night , God explained the secret to Daniel in a vision . Then Daniel praised the God of heaven .
ERV	Daniel	2	20	He said , “ Praise God ’ s name forever and ever ! Power and wisdom belong to him .
ERV	Daniel	2	21	He changes the times and seasons . He gives power to kings , and he takes their power away . He gives wisdom to people , so they become wise . He lets people learn things and become wise .
ERV	Daniel	2	22	He knows hidden secrets that are hard to understand . Light lives with him , so he knows what is in the dark and secret places .
ERV	Daniel	2	23	God of my ancestors , I thank you and praise you . You gave me wisdom and power . You told us what we asked for . You told us about the king ’ s dream. ” Daniel Tells What the Dream Means
ERV	Daniel	2	24	Then Daniel went to Arioch , the man who King Nebuchadnezzar had chosen to kill the wise men of Babylon . Daniel said to Arioch , “ Don ’ t kill the wise men of Babylon . Take me to the king . I will tell him what his dream means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	25	So very quickly , Arioch took Daniel to the king . Arioch said to the king , “ I have found a man among the captives [ b ] from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	26	The king asked Daniel ( Belteshazzar ) a question . He said , “ Are you able to tell me about my dream , and what it means ? ”
ERV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , no wise man , no man who does magic , and no Chaldean could tell the king the secret things he has asked about .
ERV	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven who tells secret things . God has given King Nebuchadnezzar dreams to show him what will happen later . This was your dream , and this is what you saw while lying on your bed :
ERV	Daniel	2	29	King , as you were lying there on your bed , you began thinking about what might happen in the future . God can tell people about secret things—he has shown you what will happen in the future .
ERV	Daniel	2	30	God also told this secret to me , not because I have greater wisdom than other men , but so that you , king , may know what it means . In that way you will understand what went through your mind .
ERV	Daniel	2	31	“ King , in your dream you saw a large statue in front of you that was very large and shiny . It was very impressive .
ERV	Daniel	2	32	The head of the statue was made from pure gold . Its chest and the arms were made from silver . The belly and upper part of the legs were made from bronze .
ERV	Daniel	2	33	The lower part of the legs was made from iron . Its feet were made partly of iron and partly of clay .
ERV	Daniel	2	34	While you were looking at the statue , you saw a rock that was cut loose , but not by human hands . Then the rock hit the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them .
ERV	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron , the clay , the bronze , the silver , and the gold broke to pieces all at the same time . And all the pieces became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summertime . The wind blew them away , and there was nothing left . No one could tell that a statue had ever been there . Then the rock that hit the statue became a very large mountain and filled up the whole earth .
ERV	Daniel	2	36	“ That was your dream . Now we will tell the king what it means .
ERV	Daniel	2	37	King , you are the most important king . The God of heaven has given you a kingdom , power , strength , and glory .
ERV	Daniel	2	38	He has given you control , and you rule over people and the wild animals and the birds . Wherever they live , God has made you ruler over them all . King Nebuchadnezzar , you are that head of gold on the statue .
ERV	Daniel	2	39	“ Another kingdom will come after you , but it will not be as great as your kingdom . Next , a third kingdom will rule over the earth—that is the bronze part .
ERV	Daniel	2	40	Then there will be a fourth kingdom . That kingdom will be strong like iron . Just as iron breaks things and smashes them to pieces , that fourth kingdom will break all the other kingdoms and smash them to pieces .
ERV	Daniel	2	41	“ You saw that the feet and toes of the statue were partly clay and partly iron . That means the fourth kingdom will be a divided kingdom . It will have some of the strength of iron in it just as you saw the iron mixed with clay .
ERV	Daniel	2	42	The toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay . So the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly weak like clay .
ERV	Daniel	2	43	You saw the iron mixed with clay , but iron and clay don ’ t completely mix together . In the same way the people of the fourth kingdom will be a mixture . They will not be united as one people .
ERV	Daniel	2	44	“ During the time of the kings of the fourth kingdom , the God of heaven will set up another kingdom that will continue forever . It will never be destroyed . And it will be the kind of kingdom that can not be passed on to another group of people . This kingdom will crush all the other kingdoms . It will bring them to an end , but that kingdom itself will continue forever .
ERV	Daniel	2	45	“ King Nebuchadnezzar , you saw a rock cut from a mountain , but no one cut that rock . The rock broke the iron , the bronze , the clay , the silver , and the gold to pieces . In this way God showed you what will happen in the future . The dream is true , and you can trust that this is what it means. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed down in front of Daniel to honor him . The king praised him . He gave an order that an offering and incense be given to honor Daniel .
ERV	Daniel	2	47	Then the king said to Daniel , “ I know for sure your God is the God over all gods and the Lord over all kings . He tells people about things they can not know . I know this is true because you were able to tell these secret things to me. ”
ERV	Daniel	2	48	Then the king gave Daniel a very important job in his kingdom and gave him many expensive gifts . Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon and put him in charge of all the wise men of Babylon .
ERV	Daniel	2	49	Daniel asked the king to make Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego important officials over the province of Babylon . The king did as Daniel asked . Daniel himself became one of the important officials who was always near the king . Footnotes - Daniel 2:4 Aramaic The text of Daniel from here to 7:28 is written in Aramaic . See “ Aramaic ” in the Word List . - Daniel 2:25 captives People taken away as prisoners . Here , it means the Jewish people who were taken to Babylon .

ERV	Daniel	3	7	So as soon as they heard the sound of the horns , flutes , lyres , sambucas , bagpipes , and all the other musical instruments , they bowed down and worshiped the gold idol .

ERV	Daniel	3	12	There are some Judeans who you made important officials in the province of Babylon that ignored your order , King . Their names are Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . They don ’ t worship your gods , and they didn ’ t bow down to worship the gold idol you set up. ”
ERV	Daniel	3	13	Nebuchadnezzar became very angry . He called for Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . So they were brought to him .
ERV	Daniel	3	14	And Nebuchadnezzar said to them , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , is it true that you don ’ t worship my gods ? And is it true that you didn ’ t bow down and worship the gold idol I have set up ?
ERV	Daniel	3	15	Now when you hear the sound of the horns , flutes , lyres , sambucas , harps , bagpipes , and all the other musical instruments , you must bow down and worship the gold idol . If you are ready to worship the idol I have made , that is good . But if you don ’ t worship it , you will be thrown very quickly into the hot furnace . Then no god will be able to save you from my power ! ”
ERV	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego answered the king , “ Nebuchadnezzar , we don ’ t need to explain these things to you .
ERV	Daniel	3	17	If you throw us into the hot furnace , the God we serve can save us . And if he wants to , he can save us from your power .
ERV	Daniel	3	18	But even if God does not save us , we want you to know , King , that we refuse to serve your gods . We will not worship the gold idol you have set up. ”
ERV	Daniel	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar became very angry with Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . He gave an order for the oven to be heated seven times hotter than it usually was .
ERV	Daniel	3	20	Then he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . He told the soldiers to throw them into the hot furnace .
ERV	Daniel	3	21	So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego were tied up and thrown into the hot furnace . They were wearing their robes , pants , cloth caps , and other clothes .
ERV	Daniel	3	22	The king was very angry when he gave the command , so the soldiers quickly made the furnace very hot . The fire was so hot that the flames killed the strong soldiers . They were killed when they went close to the fire to throw in Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
ERV	Daniel	3	23	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego fell into the fire . They were tied up very tightly .
ERV	Daniel	3	24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar jumped to his feet . He was very surprised and he asked his advisors , “ We tied only three men , and we threw only three men into the fire . Is that right ? ” His advisors said , “ Yes , King. ”
ERV	Daniel	3	25	The king said , “ Look ! I see four men walking around in the fire . They are not tied up and they are not burned . The fourth man looks like an angel . [ e ] ”
ERV	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar went to the opening of the hot furnace . He shouted , “ Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , come out ! Servants of the Most High God , come here ! ” So Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego came out of the fire .

ERV	Daniel	3	28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said , “ Praise the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego . Their God has sent his angel and saved his servants from the fire ! These three men trusted their God and refused to obey my command . They were willing to die instead of serving or worshiping any other god .
ERV	Daniel	3	29	So I now make this law : Anyone from any nation or language group who says anything against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego will be cut into pieces , and their house will be destroyed until it is a pile of dirt and ashes . No other god can save his people like this. ”
ERV	Daniel	3	30	Then the king gave Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego more important jobs in the province of Babylon . Footnotes - Daniel 3:1

ERV	Daniel	4	4	I , Nebuchadnezzar , was at my palace . I was happy and successful .
ERV	Daniel	4	2	I am very happy to tell you about the miracles and wonderful things that the Most High God did for me .
ERV	Daniel	4	3	God has done amazing miracles ! He has done powerful miracles ! His kingdom continues forever ; his rule will continue for all generations .
ERV	Daniel	4	5	I had a dream that made me afraid . I was lying on my bed , and I saw pictures and visions in my mind . These things made me very afraid .
ERV	Daniel	4	6	So I gave an order that all the wise men of Babylon be brought to me to tell me what my dream meant .
ERV	Daniel	4	7	When the men of magic and the Chaldeans came , I told them about the dream , but they could not tell me what it meant .
ERV	Daniel	4	8	Finally , Daniel came to me . ( I gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar to honor my god . The spirit of the holy gods is in him . ) I told him about my dream .
ERV	Daniel	4	9	I said , “ Belteshazzar , you are the most important of all the men of magic . I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you . I know there is no secret that is too hard for you to understand . This was what I dreamed . Tell me what it means .
ERV	Daniel	4	10	These are the visions I saw while I was lying in my bed : I looked , and there in front of me was a tree standing in the middle of the earth . The tree was very tall .
ERV	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew large and strong . The top of the tree touched the sky . [ a ] It could be seen from anywhere on earth .
ERV	Daniel	4	12	The leaves of the tree were beautiful . It had much good fruit on it . And on the tree was plenty of food for everyone . The wild animals found shelter under the tree , and the birds lived in its branches . Every animal ate from the tree .
ERV	Daniel	4	13	“ I was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed . And then I saw a holy angel coming down from heaven .
ERV	Daniel	4	14	He spoke very loud and said , ‘ Cut down the tree , and cut off its branches . Strip off its leaves . Scatter its fruit around . The animals that are under the tree will run away . The birds that are in its branches will fly away .
ERV	Daniel	4	15	But let the stump and roots stay in the ground . Put a band of iron and bronze around it . The stump and roots will stay in the field with the grass all around it . It will live among the wild animals and plants in the fields . It will become wet with dew .
ERV	Daniel	4	16	He will not think like a man any longer . He will have the mind of an animal . Seven seasons will pass while he is like this. ’
ERV	Daniel	4	17	“ Holy angels announced this punishment so that all the people on earth may know that God Most High rules over human kingdoms . God gives those kingdoms to whoever he wants , and he chooses humble people to rule them .
ERV	Daniel	4	18	“ That is what I , King Nebuchadnezzar , dreamed . Now , Belteshazzar , [ b ] tell me what it means . None of the wise men in my kingdom can tell me what that dream means . But Belteshazzar , you can interpret the dream because the spirit of the holy gods is in you. ”
ERV	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel ( also called Belteshazzar ) became very quiet for a while . What he was thinking bothered him . So the king said , “ Belteshazzar , don ’ t let the dream or its meaning make you afraid. ” Then Belteshazzar answered the king , “ My lord , I wish the dream were about your enemies , and I wish the meaning of the dream were about those against you . 20-21 You saw a tree in your dream . The tree grew large and strong . Its top touched the sky , and it could be seen from all over the earth . Its leaves were beautiful , and it had plenty of fruit . The fruit gave plenty of food for everyone . It was a home for the wild animals , and its branches were nesting places for the birds . You saw that tree .
ERV	Daniel	4	22	King , you are that tree ! You have become great and powerful . You are like the tall tree that touched the sky—your power reaches to the far parts of the earth .
ERV	Daniel	4	23	“ King , you saw a holy angel coming down from heaven . He said , ‘ Cut the tree down and destroy it . Put a band of iron and bronze around the stump and leave the stump and its roots in the ground . Leave it in the grass in the field . It will become wet with dew . He will live like a wild animal . Seven seasons will pass while he is like this. ’
ERV	Daniel	4	24	“ King , this is the meaning of the dream . God Most High has commanded these things to happen to my lord the king :
ERV	Daniel	4	25	King Nebuchadnezzar , you will be forced to go away from people . You will live among the wild animals . You will eat grass like cattle , and you will become wet with dew . Seven seasons will pass , and then you will learn this lesson . You will learn God Most High rules over human kingdoms and gives them to whoever he wants .
ERV	Daniel	4	26	“ The command to leave the stump of the tree and its roots in the ground means this : Your kingdom will be given back to you . This will happen when you learn that Most High God rules your kingdom .
ERV	Daniel	4	27	So , King , please accept my advice . Stop sinning and do what is right . Stop doing bad things and be kind to poor people . Then you might continue to be successful. ”
ERV	Daniel	4	28	All these things happened to King Nebuchadnezzar . 29-30 Twelve months after the dream , King Nebuchadnezzar was walking on the roof [ c ] of his palace in Babylon . While on the roof , the king said , “ Look at Babylon ! I built this great city . It is my palace . I built this great place by my power . I built this place to show how great I am. ”
ERV	Daniel	4	31	The words were still in his mouth when a voice came from heaven . The voice said , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , these things will happen to you : Your power as king has been taken away from you .
ERV	Daniel	4	32	You will be forced to go away from people . You will live with the wild animals and eat grass like an ox . Seven seasons will pass before you learn your lesson . Then you will learn that God Most High rules over human kingdoms and gives them to whoever he wants. ”
ERV	Daniel	4	33	These things happened immediately . Nebuchadnezzar was forced to go away from people . He began eating grass like an ox . He became wet from dew . His hair grew long like the feathers of an eagle , and his nails grew long like the claws of a bird .
ERV	Daniel	4	34	Then at the end of that time , I , Nebuchadnezzar , looked up toward heaven , and I was in my right mind again . Then I gave praise to God Most High . I gave honor and glory to him who lives forever . God rules forever ! His kingdom continues for all generations .
ERV	Daniel	4	35	People on earth are not really important . God does what he wants with the powers of heaven and the people on earth . No one can stop his powerful hand or question what he does .
ERV	Daniel	4	36	At that time God gave me my right mind again , and he gave back my great honor and power as king . My advisors and the royal people began to ask my advice again . I became the king again—even greater and more powerful than before .
ERV	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , give praise , honor , and glory to the King of Heaven . Everything he does is right . He is always fair , and he is able to make proud people humble ! Footnotes - Daniel 4:11 middle of the earth … sky The Babylonians thought the earth was flat and round like a plate or a wheel . And they thought the sky was like a glass bowl turned upside down on the earth . - Daniel 4:18 Belteshazzar Another name for Daniel . - Daniel 4:29 roof In ancient Israel , houses had flat roofs that were used as an extra room .
ERV	Daniel	5	5	Suddenly , a person ’ s hand appeared and began writing on the wall . The fingers scratched words into the plaster on the wall , near the lampstand in the king ’ s palace . The king was watching the hand as it wrote .
ERV	Daniel	5	1000	of his officials . The king was drinking wine with them .
ERV	Daniel	5	2	As Belshazzar was drinking his wine , he ordered his servants to bring the gold and silver cups . His grandfather [ a ] Nebuchadnezzar had taken these cups from the Temple in Jerusalem . King Belshazzar wanted his royal people , his wives , and his slave women to drink from those cups .
ERV	Daniel	5	3	So they brought the gold cups that had been taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem , and the king and his officials , his wives , and his women slaves drank from them .
ERV	Daniel	5	4	As they were drinking , they gave praise to their idol gods , which were only statues made from gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone .
ERV	Daniel	5	6	King Belshazzar was very afraid . His face became white from fear , and his knees were shaking and knocking together . He could not stand up because his legs were too weak .
ERV	Daniel	5	7	The king called for the men of magic and the Chaldeans to be brought to him . He said to these wise men , “ I will give a reward to anyone who can read this writing and explain to me what it means . I will give him purple robes [ b ] to wear and will put a gold chain around his neck . I will make him the third highest ruler in the kingdom. ”
ERV	Daniel	5	8	So all the king ’ s wise men came in , but they could not read the writing or understand what it meant .
ERV	Daniel	5	9	King Belshazzar ’ s officials were confused , and the king became even more afraid and worried . His face was white from fear .
ERV	Daniel	5	10	Then the king ’ s mother came into the place where the party was . She had heard the voices of the king and his royal officials . She said , “ King , may you live forever ! Don ’ t be afraid ! Don ’ t let your face be so white with fear !
ERV	Daniel	5	11	,
ERV	Daniel	5	12	The man I am talking about is named Daniel . The king gave him the name Belteshazzar . He is very smart and he knows many things . He could interpret dreams , explain secrets , and find the answer to very hard problems . Call for Daniel , he will tell you what the writing on the wall means. ”
ERV	Daniel	5	13	So they brought Daniel to the king and he asked , “ Is your name Daniel , one of the captives my father the king brought here from Judah ?
ERV	Daniel	5	14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you understand secrets and are very smart and very wise .
ERV	Daniel	5	15	The wise men and the men of magic were brought to me to read this writing on the wall . I wanted them to explain to me what it means , but they could not explain it .
ERV	Daniel	5	16	,
ERV	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered the king , “ King Belshazzar , you can keep your gifts for yourself , or you can give them to someone else . But I will still read the writing on the wall for you and explain what it means .
ERV	Daniel	5	18	. - Daniel 5:7 purple robes These clothes showed that a person was rich and powerful , like a king . Also in verses
ERV	Daniel	5	19	People from many nations and language groups were very afraid of Nebuchadnezzar because God made him a very powerful king . Nebuchadnezzar killed whoever he wanted and let those who pleased him live . If he wanted to make people important , he made them important . If he wanted to bring them down , he brought them down .
ERV	Daniel	5	20	“ But Nebuchadnezzar became proud and stubborn , so his power was taken away from him . He was taken off his royal throne and stripped of his glory .
ERV	Daniel	5	21	Then Nebuchadnezzar was forced to go away from people . His mind became like the mind of an animal . He lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like an ox . He became wet with dew . These things happened to him until he learned his lesson . He learned that God Most High rules over human kingdoms , and he gives them to whoever he wants .
ERV	Daniel	5	22	“ But Belshazzar , you already knew this . You are Nebuchadnezzar ’ s grandson , [ c ] but still you have not made yourself humble .
ERV	Daniel	5	23	No , you did not become humble . Instead , you have turned against the Lord of heaven . You ordered the drinking cups from his Temple to be brought to you . Then you and your royal officials , your wives , and your slave women drank wine from those cups . You gave praise to the gods of silver and gold , of bronze , iron , wood , and stone . They are not really gods ; they can not see or hear or understand anything . But you did not give honor to the God who has the power over your life and everything you do .
ERV	Daniel	5	24	So because of that , God sent the hand that wrote on the wall .
ERV	Daniel	5	25	These are the words that were written on the wall : mene , mene , tekel , uparsin .
ERV	Daniel	5	26	“ This is what these words mean : Mene [ d ] : God has counted the days until your kingdom will end .
ERV	Daniel	5	27	Tekel [ e ] : You have been weighed on the scales and found not good enough .
ERV	Daniel	5	28	Uparsin [ f ] : Your kingdom is being taken from you . It will be divided among the Medes and Persians. ”
ERV	Daniel	5	29	. - Daniel 5:22 grandson Or “ son. ” This does not necessarily mean they were from the same family . It might only mean that Belshazzar was one of the kings of Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar was king . - Daniel 5:26 Mene A weight , like the Hebrew word “ mina. ” This is like the word “ to count. ” - Daniel 5:27 Tekel A weight , like the Hebrew word “ shekel. ” This word is like the word meaning “ to weigh. ” - Daniel 5:28 Uparsin Literally , “ peres , ” a weight . This word is like the word meaning “ to divide ” or “ to split. ” It is also like the name of the country of Persia .
ERV	Daniel	5	30	That very same night , Belshazzar , king of the Babylonians , was killed .
ERV	Daniel	5	31	A man named Darius the Mede became the new king . Darius was about
ERV	Daniel	5	62	years old . Footnotes - Daniel 5:2 grandfather Or “ father. ” It is uncertain that Belshazzar was really Nebuchadnezzar ’ s grandson . Here , the word “ father ” might only mean “ the previous king. ” Also in verses
ERV	Daniel	6	6	So the two supervisors and the satraps went as a group to the king . They said , “ King Darius , live forever !
ERV	Daniel	6	120	satraps . Daniel was one of the three supervisors . The king put these men in this position to keep anyone from cheating him .
ERV	Daniel	6	2	He chose three men to rule over the
ERV	Daniel	6	3	Daniel proved himself to be a better supervisor than any of the others . He did this by his good character and great ability . The king was so impressed with Daniel that he planned to make him ruler over the whole kingdom .
ERV	Daniel	6	4	But when the other supervisors and the satraps heard about this , they were very jealous . They tried to find reasons to accuse Daniel . So they watched what Daniel did as he went about doing the business of the government . But they could not find anything wrong with him , so they could not accuse him of doing anything wrong . Daniel was a man people could trust . He did not cheat the king , and he worked very hard .
ERV	Daniel	6	5	Finally , they said , “ We will never find any reason to accuse Daniel of doing something wrong . So we must find something to complain about that is connected to the law of his God. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	7	The supervisors , prefects , satraps , advisors , and governors have all agreed on something . We think that the king should make this law and that everyone must obey it : For the next
ERV	Daniel	6	30	days anyone who prays to any god or man except you , the king , would be thrown into the lions ’ den . You did sign that law , didn ’ t you ? ” The king answered , “ Yes , I signed that law , and the laws of the Medes and Persians can not be canceled or changed. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	8	Now , King , make the law and sign the paper it is written on so that it can not be changed , because the laws of the Medes and Persians can not be canceled or changed. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	9	So King Darius made the law and signed it .
ERV	Daniel	6	10	Daniel always prayed to God three times every day . Three times every day , he bowed down on his knees to pray and praise God . Even though Daniel heard about the new law , he still went to his house to pray . He went up to the upper room of his house and opened the windows that faced toward Jerusalem . Then Daniel bowed down on his knees and prayed just as he always had done .
ERV	Daniel	6	11	Then the supervisors and satraps went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help .
ERV	Daniel	6	12	So they went to the king and talked to him about the law he had made . They said , “ King Darius , you signed a law that says , for the next
ERV	Daniel	6	13	Then they said to the king , “ That man Daniel is not paying any attention to you . He is one of the captives [ a ] from Judah , and he is not paying attention to the law you signed . Daniel still prays to his God three times every day. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	14	The king became very sad and upset when he heard this . He decided to save Daniel . He worked until sunset trying to think of a way to save him .
ERV	Daniel	6	15	Then the men went as a group to the king and said to him , “ Remember , King , that the law of the Medes and Persians says that no law or command signed by the king can ever be canceled or changed. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	16	So King Darius gave the order . They brought Daniel and threw him into the lions ’ den . The king said to Daniel , “ May the God you serve save you ! ”
ERV	Daniel	6	17	A big rock was brought and put over the opening of the lions ’ den . Then the king used his ring and put his seal on the rock . He also used the rings of his officials and put their seals on the rock . This showed that no one could move that rock and bring Daniel out of the lion ’ s den .
ERV	Daniel	6	18	Then King Darius went back to his house . He did not eat that night . He did not want anyone to come and entertain him . He could not sleep all night .
ERV	Daniel	6	19	The next morning , King Darius got up just as it was getting light and ran to the lions ’ den .
ERV	Daniel	6	20	He was very worried . When he got to the lions ’ den , he called to Daniel . He said , “ Daniel , servant of the living God , has your God been able to save you from the lions ? You always serve your God. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	21	Daniel answered , “ King , live forever !
ERV	Daniel	6	22	My God sent his angel to save me . The angel closed the lions ’ mouths . The lions have not hurt me because my God knows I am innocent . I never did anything wrong to you , King. ”
ERV	Daniel	6	23	King Darius was very happy . He told his servants to lift Daniel out of the lions ’ den . And when Daniel was lifted out of the den , they did not find any injury on his body . The lions did not hurt Daniel because he trusted in his God .
ERV	Daniel	6	24	Then the king gave a command to bring the men who had accused Daniel to the lions ’ den . The men and their wives and children were thrown into the lions ’ den . The lions grabbed them before they hit the floor . The lions ate their bodies and then chewed on their bones .
ERV	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote this letter to all the people from other nations and language groups all around the world : Greetings :
ERV	Daniel	6	26	I am making a new law . This law is for people in every part of my kingdom . All of you must fear and respect the God of Daniel . Daniel ’ s God is the living God ; he lives forever . His kingdom will never be destroyed . His rule will never end .
ERV	Daniel	6	27	God helps and saves people . He does amazing miracles in heaven and on earth . He saved Daniel from the lions .
ERV	Daniel	6	28	So Daniel was successful during the time Darius was king and when Cyrus the Persian was king . Footnotes - Daniel 6:13 captives People taken away as prisoners . Here , it means the Jewish people who were taken to Babylon .
ERV	Daniel	7	7	“ After that , in my vision at night , I looked , and there in front of me was a fourth animal . It looked very cruel and terrifying . It looked very strong , with large iron teeth . This animal crushed and ate its victims and walked on whatever was left of them . This fourth animal was different from all the animals I saw before it . This animal had ten horns .
ERV	Daniel	7	2	Daniel said , “ I saw my vision at night . In the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions . These winds made the sea rough .
ERV	Daniel	7	3	I saw four big animals and each one was different from the others . These four animals came up out of the sea .
ERV	Daniel	7	4	“ The first animal looked like a lion , but it had wings like an eagle . As I watched , its wings were torn off . It was helped up from the ground , and it stood up on two feet like a human . Then it was given a human mind .
ERV	Daniel	7	5	“ Then I saw another animal there in front of me that looked like a bear . It was raised up on one of its sides , and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth . It was told , ‘ Get up and eat all the meat you want ! ’
ERV	Daniel	7	6	“ After that I noticed another animal in front of me . It looked like a leopard , but it had four wings on its back . This animal had four heads . It was given authority to rule .
ERV	Daniel	7	8	“ While I was looking at the horns and thinking about them , another horn grew up among them . This was a little horn with eyes like a human . It also had a mouth that was bragging . Then the little horn pulled out three of the other horns . Judgment of the Fourth Animal
ERV	Daniel	7	9	“ As I was looking , thrones were put in their places , and the Ancient King [ b ] sat on his throne . His clothes were as white as snow . His hair was as white as wool . His throne was made from fire , [ c ] and its wheels were made from flames .
ERV	Daniel	7	10	,
ERV	Daniel	7	11	“ I kept on looking because the little horn was bragging . I kept watching until finally the fourth animal was killed . Its body was destroyed , and it was thrown into the burning fire .
ERV	Daniel	7	12	The authority and rule of the other animals had been taken from them . But they were permitted to live for a certain period of time .
ERV	Daniel	7	13	,
ERV	Daniel	7	14	“ The one who looked like a human being was given authority , glory , and complete ruling power . People from every nation and language group will serve him . His rule will last forever . His kingdom will continue forever . It will never be destroyed . The Meaning of Daniel ’ s Dream
ERV	Daniel	7	15	“ I , Daniel , was confused and worried . The visions that went through my mind bothered me .
ERV	Daniel	7	16	I went to someone who was standing there and asked him what all this meant . So he explained it to me .
ERV	Daniel	7	17	He said , ‘ The four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth .
ERV	Daniel	7	18	But God ’ s holy people will receive the kingdom , and they will have the kingdom forever and ever. ’
ERV	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal was and what it meant . The fourth animal was different from all the other animals . It was very terrible and had iron teeth and bronze claws . It was the animal that crushed and ate its victims and walked on whatever was left .
ERV	Daniel	7	20	I wanted to know about the ten horns that were on the fourth animal ’ s head and about the little horn that grew there . That little horn pulled out three of the other ten horns . That little horn had eyes and a mouth that kept on bragging , and it looked bigger than the other horns .
ERV	Daniel	7	21	As I was watching , this little horn began attacking and making war against God ’ s holy people and killing them .
ERV	Daniel	7	22	. - Daniel 7:9 fire Or “ light. ” - Daniel 7:13 someone … human being Or “ a person , a real human being. ” Literally , “ like a son of man. ” This means he looked like a normal person , not an angel or an animal . - Daniel 7:25 three and one-half years Literally , “ time , times and half time. ” - Daniel 7:27 God ’ s holy people … earth Literally , “ The rule and kingdom and greatness of the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the saints . ”
ERV	Daniel	7	23	“ And he explained this to me : ‘ The fourth animal is a fourth kingdom that will come on the earth . It will be different from all the other kingdoms . That fourth kingdom will destroy people all around the world . It will walk on and crush nations all around the world .
ERV	Daniel	7	24	The ten horns are ten kings that will come from this fourth kingdom . After those ten kings are gone , another king will come . He will be different from the kings who ruled before him . He will defeat three of the other kings .
ERV	Daniel	7	25	This special king will say things against God Most High , and he will hurt and kill God ’ s special people . That king will try to change the times and laws that have already been set . God ’ s holy people will be under that king ’ s power for three and one-half years . [ e ]
ERV	Daniel	7	26	“ ‘ But the court will decide what should happen , and that king ’ s power will be taken away . His kingdom will end completely .
ERV	Daniel	7	27	Then God ’ s holy people will rule over the kingdom and all the people from all the kingdoms of earth . [ f ] This kingdom will last forever , and people from all the other kingdoms will respect and serve them. ’
ERV	Daniel	7	28	“ And that was the end of the dream . I , Daniel , was very afraid . My face became very white from fear , and I did not tell the other people what I saw and heard. ” Footnotes - Daniel 7:1 the first year … Belshazzar This was about

ERV	Daniel	8	8	So the goat became very powerful . But after he became strong , his big horn broke off . Then four horns grew in place of the one big horn . Those four horns were easy to see . They pointed in four different directions .
ERV	Daniel	8	2	In the vision I saw that I was in the city of Susa . [ c ] Susa was the capital city in the province of Elam . I was standing by the Ulai River .
ERV	Daniel	8	3	I looked up and saw a ram standing at the side of the river . The ram had two long horns . The horns were both long , but one horn was longer than the other horn . The long horn was farther back than the other horn .
ERV	Daniel	8	4	I watched the ram run into things with its horns . I watched the ram run to the west , to the north , and to the south . No animal could stop the ram , and no one could save the other animals . That ram did whatever it wanted , and it became very powerful .
ERV	Daniel	8	5	I thought about the ram . While I was watching , I saw a male goat come from the west . It had one large horn that was easy to see . It ran so fast its feet barely touched the ground .
ERV	Daniel	8	6	The goat came to the ram with the two horns . ( This was the ram I had seen standing by the Ulai River . ) The goat was very angry and ran at the ram .
ERV	Daniel	8	7	As I watched , the goat ran at the ram and broke both of the ram ’ s horns . The ram could not stop the goat . The goat knocked it to the ground and walked all over it . There was no one to save the ram from the goat .
ERV	Daniel	8	9	Then a little horn grew from one of those four horns . It grew and became very big . It grew toward the southeast , toward the Beautiful Land .
ERV	Daniel	8	10	The little horn became very big . It grew until it reached the sky . It even threw some of heaven ’ s army [ d ] to the ground and trampled them .
ERV	Daniel	8	11	,
ERV	Daniel	8	12	Because of this sin , the daily sacrifices were stopped . Truth was thrown down to the ground . The little horn did these things and was very successful .
ERV	Daniel	8	13	. - Daniel 8:13 holy ones Here , these are probably angels . - Daniel 8:17 Human Literally , “ Son of man. ” - Daniel 8:24 but his power … himself Some ancient versions don ’ t have these words , so they may have been accidentally copied from verse
ERV	Daniel	8	14	The other holy one said , “ This will last for
ERV	Daniel	8	2300	days . Then the holy place will be repaired. ” The Vision Is Explained to Daniel
ERV	Daniel	8	15	I , Daniel , saw this vision and tried to understand what it meant . While I was thinking about the vision , someone who looked like a man suddenly stood in front of me .
ERV	Daniel	8	16	Then I heard a man ’ s voice . This voice came from above the Ulai River . The voice called out , “ Gabriel , explain the vision to this man. ”
ERV	Daniel	8	17	So Gabriel , the angel who looked like a man , came to me . I was very afraid and fell down to the ground . But Gabriel said to me , “ Human , [ f ] understand that this vision is about the time of the end. ”
ERV	Daniel	8	18	While Gabriel was speaking , I fell to the ground and went to sleep . It was a very deep sleep . Then Gabriel touched me and lifted me to my feet .
ERV	Daniel	8	19	He said , “ Now , I will explain the vision to you . I will tell you what will happen in the future . Your vision was about the end times .
ERV	Daniel	8	20	“ You saw a ram with two horns . The horns are the countries of Media and Persia .
ERV	Daniel	8	21	The goat is the king of Greece . The big horn between its eyes is the first king .
ERV	Daniel	8	22	.
ERV	Daniel	8	23	“ When the end is near for those kingdoms , there will be a very bold and cruel king who will be very tricky . This will happen when many people have turned against God .
ERV	Daniel	8	24	This king will be very powerful , but his power does not come from himself . [ g ] This king will cause terrible destruction . He will be successful in everything he does . He will destroy powerful people—even God ’ s holy people .
ERV	Daniel	8	25	“ This king will be very smart and tricky . He will use his wisdom and lies to be successful . He will think that he is very important . He will destroy many people , when they least expect it . He will try to fight even the Prince of Princes . But that cruel king ’ s power will be destroyed , and it will not be a human hand that destroys him .
ERV	Daniel	8	26	“ What I said and the vision about those times are true . But seal up the vision , because those things will not happen for a long , long time. ”
ERV	Daniel	8	27	I , Daniel , became very weak . I was sick for several days after that vision . Then I got up and went back to work for the king , but I was very upset about the vision . I did not understand what it meant . Footnotes - Daniel 8:1 After that vision Here , the original language changes from Aramaic ( see “ Aramaic ” in the Word List ) back to Hebrew . - Daniel 8:1 the third year … Belshazzar This was about

ERV	Daniel	9	9	“ But , Lord our God , you are kind and forgiving , even though we rebelled against you .
ERV	Daniel	9	2	During his first year as king , I was studying the Scriptures [ b ] and noticed in the Lord ’ s message to Jeremiah that
ERV	Daniel	9	70	weeks are ordered for these reasons : to stop doing bad things , to stop sinning , to make people pure , to bring the goodness that continues forever , to put a seal on visions and prophets , and to dedicate a very holy place .
ERV	Daniel	9	3	Then I turned to the Lord God . I prayed to him and asked him for help . I did not eat any food . I put ashes on my head and put on the clothes that showed I was sad .
ERV	Daniel	9	4	I prayed to the Lord my God and told him about all my sins . I said , “ Lord , you are a great and awesome God . You keep your agreement of love and kindness with people who love you . You keep your agreement with the people who obey your commands .
ERV	Daniel	9	5	“ But we have sinned . We have done wrong . We have done evil things . We turned against you . We turned away from your commands and good decisions .
ERV	Daniel	9	6	The prophets were your servants . They spoke for you to our kings , to our leaders , to our fathers , and to the common people in our country . But we did not listen to them .
ERV	Daniel	9	7	“ Lord , you are innocent , and the shame belongs to us , even now . Shame belongs to the people from Judah and Jerusalem , and to all the people of Israel , to those who are near and to those you scattered among many nations . They should be ashamed of all the evil things they did against you .
ERV	Daniel	9	8	“ Lord , we should all be ashamed . All our kings and leaders should be ashamed . Our ancestors should be ashamed , because we sinned against you .
ERV	Daniel	9	10	We have not obeyed the Lord our God . He used his servants , the prophets , and gave us laws , but we have not obeyed his laws .
ERV	Daniel	9	11	All the people of Israel disobeyed your teachings and turned away from you . They did not listen to you . We sinned , so you did what you promised to do . All the curses and promises [ c ] in the Law of Moses , your servant , happened to us .
ERV	Daniel	9	12	“ God said those things would happen to us and our leaders , and he made them happen . He made terrible things happen to us . No other city suffered the way Jerusalem suffered .
ERV	Daniel	9	13	All those terrible things happened to us . This happened just as it is written in the Law of Moses , but we still have not asked the Lord our God for help . We still have not stopped sinning . We still do not pay attention to your truth , Lord .
ERV	Daniel	9	14	The Lord kept the terrible things ready for us—he made them happen to us . The Lord our God did this because he is fair in everything he does . But we still have not listened to him .
ERV	Daniel	9	15	“ Lord our God , you used your power and brought us out of Egypt . We are your people . You are famous because of that , even today . We have sinned and done terrible things .
ERV	Daniel	9	16	Lord , we and our ancestors sinned against you , so your people and your city became a disgrace to everyone around us . You do so many good things , so stop being angry at Jerusalem , your city , your holy mountain .
ERV	Daniel	9	17	“ Now , our God , hear your servant ’ s prayer . Listen to my prayer for mercy . For your own sake , do good things for your holy place . [ d ]
ERV	Daniel	9	18	My God , listen to me ! Open your eyes and see all the terrible things that have happened to us . See what has happened to the city that is called by your name . I am not saying we are good people . That is not why I am asking these things . I am asking these things because I know you are kind .
ERV	Daniel	9	19	Lord , listen to me ! Forgive us ! Lord , pay attention , and then do something ! Don ’ t wait ! Do something now ! Do it for your own good ! My God , do something now , for your city and your people who are called by your name. ” The Vision About the
ERV	Daniel	9	20	I was praying to the Lord my God about his holy mountain and telling about my sins and the sins of the people of Israel .
ERV	Daniel	9	21	That was the time of the evening sacrifices . While I was still praying , Gabriel , the one I saw in the first vision , flew quickly to me and touched me . He came at the time of the evening sacrifice .
ERV	Daniel	9	22	Gabriel helped me understand the things I wanted to know . He said , “ Daniel , I have come to give you wisdom and to help you understand .
ERV	Daniel	9	23	When you first started praying , the command was given to come speak to you . God loves you very much ! You will understand this command , and you will understand the vision .
ERV	Daniel	9	24	“ God has allowed
ERV	Daniel	9	25	,
ERV	Daniel	9	62	weeks , the chosen one will be killed . [ g ] He will be gone . [ h ] Then the people of the future leader will destroy the city and the holy place . That end will come like a flood . War will continue until the end . God has ordered that place to be completely destroyed .
ERV	Daniel	9	26	After the
ERV	Daniel	9	27	. - Daniel 9:25 chosen king Literally , “ anointed one. ” - Daniel 9:26 killed Literally , “ cut off. ” - Daniel 9:26 He will be gone Or “ He will have nothing. ” - Daniel 9:27 He will do … things Or “ He will come on the wings of terrible destruction . ”
ERV	Daniel	10	10	Then a hand touched me . When that happened , I got on my hands and knees . I was so afraid that I was shaking .
ERV	Daniel	10	2	At that time I , Daniel , was very sad for three weeks .
ERV	Daniel	10	3	During those three weeks , I didn ’ t eat any fancy food ; I didn ’ t eat any meat or drink any wine . I didn ’ t put any oil on my head . I didn ’ t do any of these things for three weeks .
ERV	Daniel	10	4	On the 24th day of the first month of the year , I was standing beside the great Tigris River .
ERV	Daniel	10	5	While I was standing there , I looked up and I saw a man standing in front of me . He was wearing linen clothes . He wore a belt made of pure gold [ a ] around his waist .
ERV	Daniel	10	6	His body was like a smooth , shiny stone . His face was bright like lightning . His eyes were like flames of fire . His arms and feet were shiny like polished brass . His voice was loud like a crowd of people .
ERV	Daniel	10	7	I , Daniel , was the only one who saw the vision . The men with me didn ’ t see the vision , but they were still afraid . They were so afraid that they ran away and hid .
ERV	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone . I was watching this vision , and it made me afraid . I lost my strength . My face turned white like a dead person ’ s face , and I was helpless .
ERV	Daniel	10	9	Then I heard the man in the vision talking . As I listened to his voice , I fell into a deep sleep , with my face on the ground .
ERV	Daniel	10	11	The man in the vision said to me , “ Daniel , God loves you very much . Think very carefully about the words I will speak to you . Stand up ; I have been sent to you. ” And when he said this , I stood up . I was still shaking because I was afraid .
ERV	Daniel	10	12	Then the man in the vision started talking again . He said , “ Daniel , do not be afraid . From the very first day you decided to get wisdom and to be humble in front of God , he has been listening to your prayers . I came to you because you have been praying .
ERV	Daniel	10	13	But the prince [ b ] of Persia has been fighting against me for
ERV	Daniel	10	21	; 11:1 ; 12:1 .
ERV	Daniel	10	14	Now I have come to you , Daniel , to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future . The vision is about a time in the future. ”
ERV	Daniel	10	15	While the man was talking to me , I bowed low with my face toward the ground . I could not speak .
ERV	Daniel	10	16	Then the one who looked like a man touched my lips . I opened my mouth and started to speak . I said to the one standing in front of me , “ Sir , I am upset and afraid because of what I saw in the vision . I feel helpless .
ERV	Daniel	10	17	Sir , I am Daniel your servant . How can I talk with you ? My strength is gone and it is hard for me to breathe. ”
ERV	Daniel	10	18	The one who looked like a man touched me again . When he touched me , I felt better .
ERV	Daniel	10	19	Then he said , “ Daniel , don ’ t be afraid . God loves you very much . Peace be with you . Be strong now , be strong. ” When he spoke to me , I became stronger . Then I said , “ Sir , you have given me strength . Now you can speak. ”
ERV	Daniel	10	20	So then he said , “ Daniel , do you know why I have come to you ? Soon I must go back to fight against the prince of Persia . When I go , the prince of Greece will come .
ERV	Daniel	11	11	Then the southern king will become very angry and march out to fight against the northern king . The northern king will have a large army , but he will lose the war .
ERV	Daniel	11	2	“ Now then , Daniel , I tell you the truth : Three more kings will rule in Persia . Then a fourth king will come who will be much richer than all the other kings of Persia before him . He will use his riches to get power and turn everyone against the kingdom of Greece .
ERV	Daniel	11	3	Then a very strong and powerful king will come who will rule with much power . He will do anything he wants .
ERV	Daniel	11	4	Just as he comes to power , his kingdom will be broken up and scattered in all directions . It will not be divided among his descendants . And it will not be ruled in the same way because that kingdom will be pulled up and given to other people .
ERV	Daniel	11	5	“ The southern king will become strong , but then one of his commanders will defeat him . The commander will begin to rule , and he will be very powerful .
ERV	Daniel	11	6	“ Then after a few years , the southern king and that commander will make an agreement . The daughter of the southern king will marry the northern king . She will do this to bring peace , but she and the southern king will not be strong enough . People will turn against her and against the one who brought her to that country . And they will turn against her child and against the one who helped her .
ERV	Daniel	11	7	“ But someone from her family will come to take the southern king ’ s place . He will attack the armies of the northern king . He will go into that king ’ s strong fort . He will fight and win .
ERV	Daniel	11	8	He will take their gods and their metal idols and their expensive things made from silver and gold . He will take those things away to Egypt . Then he will not bother the northern king for a few years .
ERV	Daniel	11	9	The northern king will attack the southern kingdom . But he will lose , and then he will go back to his own country .
ERV	Daniel	11	10	“ The northern king ’ s sons will prepare for war . They will get a large army together . It will move through the land very quickly , like a powerful flood . That army will fight all the way to the strong fort of the southern king .
ERV	Daniel	11	12	The northern army will be defeated , and those soldiers will be carried away . The southern king will be very proud , and he will kill thousands of soldiers from the northern army . But he will not continue to be successful .
ERV	Daniel	11	13	The northern king will get another army that will be larger than the first one . After several years he will attack . His army will be ready for war . It will be very large and it will have many weapons .
ERV	Daniel	11	14	“ In those times many people will be against the southern king . Some of your own people who love to fight will rebel against the southern king . They will not win , but they will make the vision come true .
ERV	Daniel	11	15	Then the northern king will come . He will build ramps against the walls and will capture a strong city . The southern army will not have the power to fight back . Even the best soldiers from the southern army will not be strong enough to stop the northern army .
ERV	Daniel	11	16	“ The northern king will do whatever he wants . No one will be able to stop him . He will gain power and control in the Beautiful Land , and he will have the power to destroy it .
ERV	Daniel	11	17	The northern king will decide to use all his power to fight against the southern king , and he will make an agreement with the southern king . The king of the north will let one of his daughters marry the southern king so that he can defeat the southern king . But those plans will not succeed . His plans will not help him .
ERV	Daniel	11	18	“ Then the northern king will turn his attention to the countries along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea . He will defeat many of those cities , but then a commander will put an end to the pride and rebellion of that northern king . The commander will make the northern king ashamed .
ERV	Daniel	11	19	“ After that happens , the northern king will go back to the strong forts of his own country . But he will be weak and will fall . He will be finished .
ERV	Daniel	11	20	“ After the northern king , there will be a new ruler who sends out tax collectors so that he can live like a king . But after a few years , he will be destroyed , although he will not die in battle .
ERV	Daniel	11	21	“ That ruler will be followed by a very cruel and hated man , who will not have the honor of being from a king ’ s family . [ c ] He will become a ruler by being tricky . He will attack the kingdom when the people feel safe .
ERV	Daniel	11	22	He will defeat large and powerful armies . He will even defeat the leader with the agreement .
ERV	Daniel	11	23	Many nations will make agreements with that cruel and hated ruler , but he will lie and trick them . He will gain much power , but only a few people will support him .
ERV	Daniel	11	24	“ When the richest countries feel safe , that cruel and hated ruler will attack them . He will attack at just the right time and will be successful where his ancestors were not successful . He will take things from the countries he defeated , and he will give them to his followers . He will plan to defeat and destroy strong cities . He will be successful—but only for a short time .
ERV	Daniel	11	25	“ That very cruel and hated ruler will have a very large army . He will use that army to show his strength and courage and attack the southern king . The southern king will get a very large and powerful army and go to war . But the people who are against him will make secret plans , and the southern king will be defeated .
ERV	Daniel	11	26	People who were supposed to be good friends of the southern king will try to destroy him . His army will be defeated . Many of his soldiers will be killed in battle .
ERV	Daniel	11	27	Those two kings will want to make trouble . They will sit around the table planning their lies , but it will not do either one of them any good because God has set a time for their end to come .
ERV	Daniel	11	28	“ The northern king will go back to his own country with much wealth . Then he will decide to do bad things against the holy agreement . [ d ] He will do the things he planned , and then he will go back to his own country .
ERV	Daniel	11	29	“ At the right time , the northern king will attack the southern king again . But this time he will not be successful as he was before .
ERV	Daniel	11	30	Ships from Cyprus will come and fight against the northern king . He will see those ships coming and be afraid . Then he will turn back and take out his anger on the holy agreement . He will turn back and help those who stopped following the holy agreement .
ERV	Daniel	11	31	The northern king will send his army to do terrible things to the Temple in Jerusalem . They will stop the people from offering the daily sacrifice . Then they will do something really terrible . They will set up that terrible thing that causes destruction .
ERV	Daniel	11	32	“ The northern king will use lies and smooth talking to trick those who quit following the holy agreement , so they will sin even worse . But those who know God and obey him will be strong . They will fight back .
ERV	Daniel	11	33	“ Those wise teachers will help the other people understand what is happening . But even they will have to suffer persecution . Some of them will be killed with swords . Some of them will be burned or taken prisoner . Some of them will have their homes and things taken away .
ERV	Daniel	11	34	When those wise people are punished , they will receive some help , but many people who join them will be hypocrites .
ERV	Daniel	11	35	Some of the wise people will stumble and make mistakes . But the persecution must come so that they can be made stronger and purer until the time of the end . Then , at the right time , that time of the end will come . The King Who Praises Himself
ERV	Daniel	11	36	“ The northern king will do whatever he wants . He will brag about himself . He will praise himself and think that he is even better than a god . He will say things that no one has ever heard . He will say those things against the God of gods . He will be successful until all the evil things have happened . Then what God has planned to happen will happen .
ERV	Daniel	11	37	“ That northern king will not care about the gods his ancestors worshiped . He will not care about the gods women worship . He will not care about any god . Instead , he will praise himself and make himself more important than any god .
ERV	Daniel	11	38	The northern king will not worship any god , but he will worship power . Power and strength will be his god . His ancestors didn ’ t love power as he does . He will honor the god of power with gold and silver , expensive jewels , and gifts .
ERV	Daniel	11	39	“ That northern king will attack strong fortresses with the help of this foreign god . He will give much honor to the foreign rulers who join him . He will put many people under their rule . He will make the rulers pay him for the land they rule over .
ERV	Daniel	11	40	“ At the time of the end , the southern king will fight a battle against the northern king . The northern king will attack him with chariots and soldiers on horses and many large ships . The northern king will rush through the land like a flood .
ERV	Daniel	11	41	The northern king will attack the Beautiful Land . He will defeat many countries . But Edom , Moab , and the leaders of Ammon will be saved from him .
ERV	Daniel	11	42	The northern king will show his power in many countries . Egypt will also learn how powerful he is .
ERV	Daniel	11	43	He will get treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt . The Libyans and Ethiopians will obey him .
ERV	Daniel	11	44	But that northern king will hear news from the east and the north that will make him afraid and angry . He will go to completely destroy many nations .
ERV	Daniel	11	45	He will set up his king ’ s tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain . [ e ] But finally , that bad king will die . There will be no one to help him when his end comes . Footnotes - Daniel 11:1 the first … Mede This was about

ERV	Daniel	12	12	The one who waits for and comes to the end of the
ERV	Daniel	12	2	There are many who are dead and buried . [ a ] Some of them will wake up and live forever , but others will wake up to shame and disgrace forever .

ERV	Daniel	12	4	“ But you , Daniel , keep this message a secret . You must close the book and keep this secret until the time of the end . Many people will go here and there looking for true knowledge , and the true knowledge will increase. ”
ERV	Daniel	12	5	Then I , Daniel , noticed two other men . One man was standing on my side of the river , and the other was standing on the other side .
ERV	Daniel	12	6	The man who was dressed in linen was standing over the water in the river . One of the two men said to him , “ How long will it be before these amazing things come true ? ”
ERV	Daniel	12	7	The man dressed in linen and standing over the water lifted his right and left hands toward heaven . And I heard him make a promise using the name of God who lives forever . He said , “ It will be for three and one-half years . [ c ] The power of the holy people will be broken , and then all these things will finally come true. ”
ERV	Daniel	12	8	I heard the answer , but I really didn ’ t understand . So I asked , “ Sir , what will happen after all this comes true ? ”
ERV	Daniel	12	9	He answered , “ Go on about your life Daniel . The message is hidden . It will be a secret until the time of the end .
ERV	Daniel	12	10	Many people will be made pure—they will make themselves clean . But evil people will continue to be evil . And those wicked people will not understand these things , but the wise people will understand them .
ERV	Daniel	12	11	“ The daily sacrifice will be stopped . There will be
ERV	Daniel	12	1290	days from that time until the time that the terrible thing that destroys is set up .
ERV	Daniel	12	1335	days will be very happy .

At the end you will rise from death and receive your share of the promise. ” Footnotes - Daniel 12:2 are dead and buried Literally , “ sleep in the dust. ” - Daniel 12:3 Or “ The wise and successful teachers will shine like the sun rays in the sky .

ERV	Hosea	1	10	“ In the future the number of the people of Israel will be like the sand of the sea , which you can not measure or count . In the same place that God told them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ he will call them ‘ children of the Living God. ’

ERV	Jonah	1	14	So the men cried to the Lord , “ Lord , please don ’ t say we are guilty of killing an innocent man . Please don ’ t make us die for killing him . We know you are the Lord , and you will do whatever you want. ”
ERV	Jonah	1	15	So the men threw Jonah into the sea . The storm stopped , and the sea became calm .
ERV	Jonah	1	16	When the men saw this , they began to fear and respect the Lord . They offered a sacrifice and made special promises to the Lord .
ERV	Jonah	1	17	When Jonah fell into the sea , the Lord chose a very big fish to swallow Jonah . He was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights . Footnotes - Jonah 1:1 Jonah This is probably the same prophet mentioned in
ERV	Jonah	2	2	“ I was in very bad trouble . I called to the Lord for help , and he answered me . I was deep in the grave . I cried to you , and you heard my voice .
ERV	Jonah	2	3	“ You threw me into the sea . Your powerful waves splashed over me . I went down , down into the deep sea . The water was all around me .
ERV	Jonah	2	4	Then I thought , ‘ Now I must go where you can not see me , ’ but I continued looking to your holy Temple for help .
ERV	Jonah	2	5	“ The seawater closed over me . The water covered my mouth , and I could not breathe . [ a ] I went down , down into the deep sea . Seaweed wrapped around my head .
ERV	Jonah	2	6	I was at the bottom of the sea , the place where the mountains begin . I thought I was locked in this prison forever , but the Lord my God took me out of my grave . God , you gave me life again !
ERV	Jonah	2	7	“ My soul gave up all hope , but then I remembered the Lord . I prayed to you , and you heard my prayers in your holy Temple .
ERV	Jonah	2	8	“ Some people worship useless idols , but those statues never help them . [ b ]
ERV	Jonah	2	9	I will give sacrifices to you , and I will praise and thank you . I will make special promises to you , and I will do what I promise. ” Salvation only comes from the Lord !
ERV	Jonah	2	10	Then the Lord spoke to the fish , and it vomited Jonah out of its stomach onto the dry land .
ERV	Jonah	3	3	So Jonah obeyed the Lord and went to Nineveh . It was a very large city . A person had to walk for three days to travel through it .
ERV	Jonah	3	2	“ Go to that big city Nineveh , and say what I tell you. ”
ERV	Jonah	3	4	Jonah went to the center of the city and began speaking to the people . He said , “ After
ERV	Jonah	3	40	days , Nineveh will be destroyed ! ”
ERV	Jonah	3	5	The people of Nineveh believed God . They decided to stop eating for a time to think about their sins . They put on special clothes to show they were sorry . All the people in the city did this , from the most important to the least important .
ERV	Jonah	3	6	When the king of Nineveh heard about this , he left his throne , removed his robe , put on special clothes to show that he was sorry , and sat in ashes . [ a ]
ERV	Jonah	3	7	The king wrote a special message and sent it throughout the city : A command from the king and his great rulers : For a short time no person or animal should eat anything . No herd or flock will be allowed in the fields . Nothing living in Nineveh will eat or drink water .
ERV	Jonah	3	8	But every person and every animal must be covered with a special cloth to show they are sad . People must cry loudly to God . Everyone must change their life and stop doing bad things .
ERV	Jonah	3	9	Who knows ? Maybe God will stop being angry and change his mind , and we will not be punished .
ERV	Jonah	3	10	God saw what the people did . He saw that they stopped doing evil . So God changed his mind and did not do what he planned . He did not punish the people . Footnotes - Jonah 3:6 sat in ashes People did this to show that they were sad .
ERV	Jonah	4	4	Then the Lord said , “ Do you think it is right for you to be angry ? ”
ERV	Jonah	4	2	He complained to the Lord and said , “ Lord , I knew this would happen ! I was in my own country , and you told me to come here . At that time I knew that you would forgive the people of this evil city , so I decided to run away to Tarshish . I knew that you are a kind God . I knew that you show mercy and don ’ t want to punish people . I knew that you are kind , and if these people stopped sinning , you would change your plans to destroy them .
ERV	Jonah	4	3	So now , Lord , just kill me . It is better for me to die than to live. ”
ERV	Jonah	4	5	Jonah went out of the city to a place near the city on the east side . He made a shelter for himself and sat there in the shade , waiting to see what would happen to the city . The Gourd Plant and the Worm
ERV	Jonah	4	6	The Lord made a gourd plant grow quickly over Jonah . This made a cool place for Jonah to sit and helped him to be more comfortable . He was very happy because of this plant .
ERV	Jonah	4	7	The next morning , God sent a worm to eat part of the plant . The worm began eating the plant , and the plant died .
ERV	Jonah	4	8	After the sun was high in the sky , God caused a hot east wind to blow . The sun became very hot on Jonah ’ s head , and he became very weak . He asked God to let him die . He said , “ It is better for me to die than to live. ”
ERV	Jonah	4	9	But God said to Jonah , “ Do you think it is right for you to be angry just because this plant died ? ” Jonah answered , “ Yes , it is right for me to be angry ! I am angry enough to die ! ”
ERV	Jonah	4	10	And the Lord said , “ You did nothing for that plant . You did not make it grow . It grew up in the night , and the next day it died . And now you are sad about it .
ERV	Jonah	4	11	If you can get upset over a plant , surely I can feel sorry for a big city like Nineveh . There are many people and animals in that city . There are more than 120,000 people there who did not know they were doing wrong. ” [ a ] Footnotes - Jonah 4:11 people … wrong Literally , “ people who do not know their right from their left. ” This might mean “ innocent children . ”

ERV	Micah	1	4	The mountains will melt under him like wax in a fire . The valleys will break apart and slide like water rushing down a hill .
ERV	Micah	1	5	This will happen because of Jacob ’ s sin , because of the sins of the nation [ c ] of Israel . Samaria , the Cause of Sin What caused Jacob to sin ? It was Samaria . Where is the high place in Judah ? It is Jerusalem .
ERV	Micah	1	6	So I will change Samaria into a pile of rocks in the field , a place ready for planting grapes . I will push Samaria ’ s stones down into the valley , leaving nothing but the foundations .
ERV	Micah	1	7	All her idols will be broken to pieces . And the offerings to her idols will be burned . I will destroy all her statues of false gods , because she got them as pay for being a prostitute . So those things will be taken away to be used again for paying prostitutes . Micah ’ s Great Sadness

ERV	Nahum	1	9	Why are you making plans against the Lord ? He will bring complete destruction , so you will not cause trouble again .
ERV	Nahum	1	10	You will be destroyed completely like thornbushes burning under a pot . You will be destroyed like dry weeds that burn quickly .
ERV	Nahum	1	11	Someone from Nineveh is making evil plans against the Lord . That advisor is a worthless troublemaker .
ERV	Nahum	1	12	This is what the Lord said : “ The people of Assyria are at full strength . They have many soldiers , but they will all be cut down . They will all be finished . My people , I made you suffer , but I will make you suffer no more .
ERV	Nahum	1	13	Now I will set you free from the power of Assyria . I will take the yoke off your neck and tear away the chains holding you. ”
ERV	Nahum	1	14	King of Assyria , the Lord gave this command about you : “ You will not have any descendants to wear your name . I will destroy your carved idols and metal statues that are in the temple of your gods . I am preparing your grave , because your end is coming soon ! [ b ] ”
ERV	Nahum	1	15	Judah , look ! There , coming over the mountains , is a messenger bringing good news ! He says there is peace . Judah , celebrate your special festivals and do what you promised . Those worthless troublemakers will not come through and attack you again . They have all been destroyed . Footnotes - Nahum 1:1 Nineveh The capital city of the country of Assyria . Assyria destroyed Israel in 722–721 B.C . - Nahum 1:14 because your end is coming soon Or “ you are not important ” or “ you are so hated . ”
ERV	Nahum	2	2	Yes , the Lord changed Jacob ’ s pride . He made it like Israel ’ s pride . The enemy destroyed them and ruined their grapevines .
ERV	Nahum	2	3	The shields of his soldiers are red . Their uniforms are bright red . Their chariots are shining like flames of fire and are lined up for battle . Their horses are ready to go .
ERV	Nahum	2	4	The chariots race wildly through the streets and rush back and forth through the square . They look like burning torches , like lightning flashing from place to place !
ERV	Nahum	2	5	The enemy calls for his best soldiers . They stumble as they rush ahead . They run to the wall and set up their shield over the battering ram .
ERV	Nahum	2	6	But the gates by the rivers are open , and the enemy comes flooding in and destroys the king ’ s palace .
ERV	Nahum	2	7	The enemy takes away the queen , and her slave girls moan sadly like doves . They beat their breasts to show their sadness .
ERV	Nahum	2	8	Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away . People yell , “ Stop ! Stop running away ! ” But it does not do any good .
ERV	Nahum	2	9	Take the silver ! Take the gold ! There are many things to take . There are many treasures .
ERV	Nahum	2	10	Now Nineveh is empty . Everything is stolen . The city is ruined . People have lost their courage , their hearts melt with fear , their knees knock together , their bodies shake , and their faces turn pale .
ERV	Nahum	2	11	Where is that great city now ? It was like a den where the lions feed their young . It was a place where people felt safe , like lions in a cave with no one there to harm them .
ERV	Nahum	2	12	The lion was able to catch plenty of food to feed his cubs and his mate . He filled his cave with the animals he killed . He filled his den with the meat he gathered .
ERV	Nahum	2	13	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ I am against you , Nineveh . I will burn your chariots and kill your ‘ young lions ’ in battle . You will not hunt anyone on earth again . People will never again hear bad news from your messengers . ”
ERV	Nahum	3	3	Soldiers on horses are attacking , their swords are shining , their spears are gleaming ! There are many dead people . Dead bodies are piled up—too many bodies to count . People are tripping over the dead bodies .
ERV	Nahum	3	2	You can hear the sounds of whips and the noise of wheels . You can hear horses galloping and chariots bouncing along !
ERV	Nahum	3	4	All this happened because of Nineveh . Nineveh is like a prostitute who could never get enough . She wanted more and more . She sold herself to many nations , and she used her magic to make them her slaves .
ERV	Nahum	3	5	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ I am against you , Nineveh . I will pull your dress [ a ] up over your face . I will let the nations see your naked body . The kingdoms will see your shame .
ERV	Nahum	3	6	I will throw dirty things on you and treat you in a hateful way . People will look at you and laugh .
ERV	Nahum	3	7	Everyone who sees you will be shocked . They will say , ‘ Nineveh is destroyed . Who will cry for her ? ’ I know I can not find anyone to comfort you , Nineveh. ”
ERV	Nahum	3	8	Nineveh , are you better than Thebes [ b ] on the Nile River ? Thebes also had water all around her to protect herself from enemies . She used that water like a wall too .
ERV	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia and Egypt made Thebes strong . Libya and the Sudan supported her ,
ERV	Nahum	3	10	but Thebes was defeated . Her people were taken away as prisoners to a foreign country . Soldiers beat her small children to death at every street corner . They threw lots to see who got to keep the important people as slaves . They put chains on all the important men of Thebes .
ERV	Nahum	3	11	So , Nineveh , you will also fall like a drunk . You will try to hide . You will look for a safe place away from the enemy .
ERV	Nahum	3	12	But Nineveh , all your strong places will be like fig trees . When new figs become ripe , people come and shake the tree . The figs fall into their mouths . They eat them , and the figs are gone .
ERV	Nahum	3	13	Nineveh , your people are all like women—and the enemy soldiers are ready to take them . The gates of your land are open wide for your enemies to come in . Fire has destroyed the wooden bars across the gates .
ERV	Nahum	3	14	Get water and store it inside your city , because the enemy soldiers will surround your city . Make your defenses strong ! Get clay to make more bricks and mix the mortar . Get the molds for making bricks .
ERV	Nahum	3	15	You can do all these things , but the fire will still destroy you completely . And the sword will kill you . Your land will look like a swarm of grasshoppers came and ate everything . Nineveh , you grew and grew . You became like a swarm of grasshoppers . You were like a swarm of locusts .
ERV	Nahum	3	16	You have many traders who go places and buy things . They are as many as the stars in the sky . They are like locusts that come and eat until everything is gone and then leave .
ERV	Nahum	3	17	And your government officials are also like locusts that settle on a stone wall on a cold day . But when the sun comes up , the rocks become warm , and the locusts all fly away . And no one knows where .
ERV	Nahum	3	18	King of Assyria , your shepherds fell asleep . These powerful men are sleeping . And now your sheep have wandered away on the mountains . There is no one to bring them back .
ERV	Nahum	3	19	Nineveh , you have been hurt badly , and nothing can heal your wound . Everyone who hears the news of your destruction claps their hands . They are all happy , because they all felt the pain you caused again and again .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	1	This is the message that was given to Habakkuk the prophet .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	2	Lord , I continue to ask for help . When will you listen to me ? I cried to you about the violence , but you did nothing !
ERV	Habakkuk	1	3	People are stealing things and hurting others . They are arguing and fighting . Why do you make me look at these terrible things ?
ERV	Habakkuk	1	4	The law is weak and not fair to people . Evil people win their fights against good people . So the law is no longer fair , and justice does not win anymore . The Lord Answers Habakkuk
ERV	Habakkuk	1	5	“ Look at the other nations ! Watch them , and you will be amazed . I will do something in your lifetime that will amaze you . You would not believe it even if you were told about it .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	6	I will make the Babylonians [ a ] a strong nation . They are cruel and powerful fighters . They will march across the earth . They will take houses and cities that don ’ t belong to them .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	7	The Babylonians will scare the other people . They will do what they want to do and go where they want to go .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses will be faster than leopards and more dangerous than wolves at sunset . Their horse soldiers will come from faraway places . They will attack their enemies quickly , like a hungry eagle swooping down from the sky .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	9	The one thing they all want to do is fight . Their armies will march fast like the wind in the desert . And the Babylonian soldiers will take many prisoners—as many as the grains of sand .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	10	“ The Babylonian soldiers will laugh at the kings of other nations . Foreign rulers will be like jokes to them . The Babylonian soldiers will laugh at the cities with tall , strong walls . They will simply build dirt roads up to the top of the walls and easily defeat the cities .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	11	Then they will leave like the wind and go on to fight against other places . The only thing the Babylonians worship is their own strength. ” Habakkuk ’ s Second Complaint
ERV	Habakkuk	1	12	Lord , you are the one who lives forever ! You are my holy God who never dies ! [ b ] Lord , you created the Babylonians to do what must be done . Our Rock , you created them to punish people .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	13	Your eyes are too good to look at evil . You can not stand to see people doing wrong . So why do you permit such evil ? How can you watch while the wicked destroy people who are so much better ?
ERV	Habakkuk	1	14	You made people like fish in the sea . They are like little sea animals without a leader .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	15	The enemy catches all of them with hooks and nets . The enemy catches them in his net and drags them in , and the enemy is very happy with what he caught .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	16	His net helps him live like the rich and enjoy the best food . So the enemy worships his net . He makes sacrifices and burns incense to honor his net .
ERV	Habakkuk	1	17	Will he continue to take riches with his net ? Will he continue destroying people without showing mercy ? Footnotes - Habakkuk 1:6 Babylonians Literally , “ Chaldeans , ” a tribe of Arameans who gained control in Babylon . King Nebuchadnezzar was from this tribe . - Habakkuk 1:12 Lord , you are … never dies Or “ Lord , you have been my holy God forever ! Surely we will not die . ”
ERV	Habakkuk	2	2	The Lord answered me , “ Write down what I show you . Write it clearly on a sign so that the message will be easy to read . [ a ]
ERV	Habakkuk	2	3	This message is about a special time in the future . This message is about the end , and it will come true . Just be patient and wait for it . That time will come ; it will not be late .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	4	This message can not help those who refuse to listen to it , but those who are good will live because they believe it .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	5	“ Wine can trick a person . In the same way a strong man ’ s pride can fool him , but he will not find peace . He is like death—he always wants more and more . And , like death , he will never be satisfied . He will continue to defeat other nations and to make those people his prisoners .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	6	But soon enough , all those people will laugh at him and tell stories about his defeat . They will laugh and say , ‘ It ’ s too bad that the man who took so many things will not get to keep them ! He made himself rich by collecting debts. ’
ERV	Habakkuk	2	7	“ Strong man , you have taken money from people . One day they will wake up and realize what is happening , and they will stand against you . Then they will take things from you , and you will be very afraid .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	8	You have stolen things from many nations , so they will take much from you . You have killed many people and destroyed lands and cities . You have killed all the people there .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	9	“ Look at you people ! You get rich by cheating people , and it hurts your own family ! You build your houses high on the cliffs to protect yourself from danger .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	10	You planned shameful things , and that will bring shame to your own family . You have done wrong , and it will cost you your life .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	11	The stones of the walls will cry out against you . Even the wooden rafters [ b ] in your own house will prove that you are wrong .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	12	“ Look at them ! They kill people to build their city and do wicked things to make their walled city strong .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	13	But the Lord All-Powerful has decided that a fire will destroy everything that those people worked to build . All their work will be for nothing .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	14	Then people everywhere will know about the Glory of the Lord . This news will spread just as water spreads out into the sea .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	15	It will be very bad for those who become angry and make other people suffer . Like an angry drunk , they knock others to the ground and strip them naked , just to see their naked bodies . [ c ]
ERV	Habakkuk	2	16	“ But they will know the Lord ’ s anger . It will be like a cup of poison in the Lord ’ s right hand . They will taste that anger , and then they will fall to the ground like drunks . “ Evil ruler , you will drink from that cup . You will get shame , not honor .
ERV	Habakkuk	2	17	You hurt many people in Lebanon and stole many animals there . So you will be afraid because of the people who died and because of the bad things you did to that country . You will be afraid because of what you did to those cities and to the people who lived there. ” The Message About Idols
ERV	Habakkuk	2	18	Their false god will not help them , because it is only a statue that someone covered with metal . It is only a statue , so whoever made it can not expect it to help . That statue can not even speak !
ERV	Habakkuk	2	19	Look at them ! They speak to a wooden statue and tell it , “ Get up ! Rescue me. ” They talk to a stone that can not speak and say , “ Wake up ! ” Don ’ t you know those things can not help you ? That statue may be covered with gold and silver , but there is no life in it .

ERV	Habakkuk	3	5	The sickness went before him , and the destroyer followed behind him . [ b ]
ERV	Habakkuk	3	6	He stood and judged the earth . He looked at the people of all the nations , and they shook with fear . For many years the mountains stood strong , but those mountains fell to pieces . Those old , old hills fell down . God has always been able to do that .
ERV	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw that the cities of Cushan were in trouble and that the houses of Midian trembled with fear .

ERV	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw you and shook . The water flowed off the land . The water from the sea made a loud noise as it lost its power over the land .
ERV	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and the moon lost their brightness . They stopped shining when they saw your bright flashes of lightning . That lightning was like spears and arrows shooting through the air .
ERV	Habakkuk	3	12	In anger you walked on the earth and punished the nations .
ERV	Habakkuk	3	13	You came to save your people and to lead your chosen king [ d ] to victory . You killed the leader in every evil family , from the least important person to the most important in the land . [ e ] Selah

ERV	Haggai	1	4	“ You people think the right time has come for you to live in nice houses . You live in houses with beautiful wooden paneling on the walls , but the Lord ’ s house is still in ruins .
ERV	Haggai	1	5	Now the Lord All-Powerful says , ‘ Think about what is happening .
ERV	Haggai	1	6	You have planted many seeds , but you have gathered only a few crops . You have food to eat , but not enough to get full . You have something to drink , but not enough to get drunk . You have some clothes to wear , but not enough to keep warm . You earn a little money , but you don ’ t know where it all goes . It ’ s as though there is a hole in your pocket ! ’ [ a ] ”
ERV	Haggai	1	7	The Lord All-Powerful said , “ Think about what you are doing .
ERV	Haggai	1	8	Go up to the mountains , get the wood , and build the Temple . Then I will be pleased with the Temple , and I will be honored. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Haggai	1	9	The Lord All-Powerful said , “ You people look for a big harvest , but when you go to gather the crop , there is only a little grain . So you bring that grain home , and then I send a wind that blows it all away . Why is this happening ? Because my house is still in ruins while each of you runs home to take care of your own house .
ERV	Haggai	1	10	That is why the sky holds back its dew and why the earth holds back its crops .
ERV	Haggai	1	11	“ I gave the command for the land and the mountains to be dry . The grain , the new wine , the olive oil , and everything the earth produces will be ruined . [ b ] All the people and all the animals will become weak. ” Work Begins on the New Temple
ERV	Haggai	1	12	The Lord God had sent Haggai to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and to the high priest , Joshua son of Jehozadak . So these men and all the people listened to the voice of the Lord their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet . And the people showed their fear and respect for the Lord their God .
ERV	Haggai	1	13	Then Haggai , the Lord ’ s messenger , delivered this message to the people : “ The Lord says , ‘ I am with you ! ’ ”
ERV	Haggai	1	14	Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel was the governor of Judah . Joshua son of Jehozadak was the high priest . The Lord made them and the rest of the people excited about working on the Temple of their God , the Lord All-Powerful .
ERV	Haggai	1	15	So they began this work on the 24th day of the sixth month in the second year Darius was the king . Footnotes - Haggai 1:6 You … pocket Or “ The one who saves money is putting it into a purse full of holes. ” - Haggai 1:11 dry … ruined The Hebrew word “ dry ” is like the Hebrew word “ ruined . ”
ERV	Haggai	2	2	“ Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , the governor of Judah , and to Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to all the people . Say this :
ERV	Haggai	2	3	‘ How many of you people look at this Temple and try to compare it to the beautiful Temple that was destroyed ? What do you think ? Does this Temple seem like nothing when you compare it with the first Temple ?
ERV	Haggai	2	4	But the Lord says , “ Zerubbabel , don ’ t be discouraged ! ” And the Lord says , “ Joshua son of Jehozadak , you are the high priest . Don ’ t be discouraged ! And all you people who live in the land , don ’ t be discouraged ! Continue this work , because I am with you. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Haggai	2	5	“ ‘ I made an agreement with you when you left Egypt , and I have kept my promise . My Spirit is with you , so don ’ t be afraid ! ’
ERV	Haggai	2	6	This is what the Lord All-Powerful said , ‘ In just a little while , I will once again shake things up . I will shake heaven and earth , and I will shake the sea and the dry land .
ERV	Haggai	2	7	I will shake up the nations , and they will come to you with wealth from every nation . And then I will fill this Temple with glory. ’ That is what the Lord All-Powerful said !
ERV	Haggai	2	8	‘ All their silver really belongs to me ! And all the gold is mine ! ’ This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Haggai	2	9	And the Lord All-Powerful said , ‘ This last Temple will be more beautiful than the first one , and I will bring peace to this place. ’ Remember , this is what the Lord All-Powerful said. ” Today Begins a Time of Blessing
ERV	Haggai	2	10	measures in the pile . People wanted to get
ERV	Haggai	2	11	“ The Lord All-Powerful commands you to ask the priests what the law says about these things :
ERV	Haggai	2	12	‘ Suppose a man carries some meat in the fold of his clothes . This meat is part of a sacrifice , so it is holy . If his clothes touch some bread , cooked food , wine , oil , or some other food , will the thing the clothes touch become holy ? ’ ” The priests answered , “ No. ”
ERV	Haggai	2	13	Then Haggai said , “ Whoever touches a dead body will become unclean . Now if they touch anything else , will it also become unclean ? ” The priests answered , “ Yes , it will become unclean. ”
ERV	Haggai	2	14	Then Haggai said , “ This is what the Lord God said : ‘ This is also true for the people of this nation . They were not pure and holy before me . So anything they did with their hands and anything they offered at the altar became unclean .
ERV	Haggai	2	15	“ ‘ Think about what has happened to you . Think about how things were before you began working on the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	Haggai	2	16	People wanted
ERV	Haggai	2	20	Another message from the Lord came to Haggai on the 24th day of the month . This is the message :
ERV	Haggai	2	50	jars of wine from the wine vat , but there were only
ERV	Haggai	2	17	That was because I punished you . I sent the diseases that killed your plants and the hail that destroyed the things you made with your hands . I did this , but still you did not come to me. ’ This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Haggai	2	18	“ The Lord said , ‘ Today is the 24th day of the ninth month . You have finished laying the foundation of the Lord ’ s Temple . So notice what happens from this day forward :
ERV	Haggai	2	19	Your seed for planting is still in the barn . And look at the vines , the fig trees , and the pomegranate and olive trees . They have not yet produced any fruit . But beginning today , I will bless you. ’ ”
ERV	Haggai	2	21	“ Go to Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah and tell him that I will shake heaven and earth .
ERV	Haggai	2	22	And I will overthrow many kings and kingdoms and destroy the power of the kingdoms of those other people . I will destroy their chariots and their riders . I will defeat their war horses and riders . These armies are friends now , but they will turn against each other and kill each other with swords. ”
ERV	Haggai	2	23	This is what the Lord All-Powerful says : “ Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , my servant , I have chosen you . I , the Lord , tell you that at that time I will use you like a signet ring to represent my authority ! ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Zechariah	1	1	Zechariah son of Berekiah received a message from the Lord . This was in the eighth month of the second year that Darius [ a ] was king in Persia . ( Zechariah was the son of Berekiah , who was the son of Iddo the prophet . ) This is that message :
ERV	Zechariah	1	2	The Lord became very angry with your ancestors .
ERV	Zechariah	1	3	So you must tell the people what the Lord All-Powerful says , “ Come back to me , says the Lord All-Powerful , and I will come back to you. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Zechariah	1	4	“ Don ’ t be like your ancestors . In the past the prophets spoke to them and said , ‘ The Lord All-Powerful wants you to change your evil way of living . Stop doing evil things ! ’ But your ancestors did not listen to me. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Zechariah	1	5	“ Your ancestors are gone , and those prophets did not live forever .
ERV	Zechariah	1	6	The prophets were my servants . I used them to tell your ancestors about my laws and teachings . Your ancestors finally learned their lesson and said , ‘ The Lord All-Powerful did what he said he would do . He punished us for the way we lived and for all the evil things we did. ’ So they came back to God. ” The Four Horses
ERV	Zechariah	1	7	.
ERV	Zechariah	1	8	At night I saw a man riding a red horse . He was standing among some myrtle bushes in the valley . Behind him , there were red , brown , and white horses .
ERV	Zechariah	1	9	I said , “ Sir , what are these horses for ? ” Then the angel speaking to me said , “ I will show you what these horses are for. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle bushes said , “ The Lord sent these horses to go here and there on earth. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	11	Then the horses spoke to the Lord ’ s angel standing among the myrtle bushes and said , “ We have walked here and there on the earth , and everything is calm and quiet. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	12	Then the Lord ’ s angel said , “ Lord All-Powerful , how long before you comfort Jerusalem and the cities of Judah ? You have shown your anger at these cities for
ERV	Zechariah	1	70	years now. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	13	Then the Lord answered the angel who was talking with me . He spoke good , comforting words .
ERV	Zechariah	1	14	Then the angel told me to tell the people this : The Lord All-Powerful says : “ I have a strong love for Jerusalem and Zion .
ERV	Zechariah	1	15	And I am very angry at the nations that feel so safe . I was only a little angry , and I used them to punish my people . But they caused too much damage. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	16	So the Lord says , “ I will come back to Jerusalem and comfort her. ” The Lord All-Powerful says , “ Jerusalem will be rebuilt , and my house will be built there. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	17	The angel also said , “ The Lord All-Powerful says , ‘ My towns will be rich again . I will comfort Zion . I will again choose Jerusalem to be my special city. ’ ” The Four Horns and Four Workers
ERV	Zechariah	1	18	Then I looked up and I saw four horns .
ERV	Zechariah	1	19	So I asked the angel who was talking with me , “ What do these horns mean ? ” He said , “ These are the horns that forced the people of Israel , Judah , and Jerusalem to go to foreign countries. ”
ERV	Zechariah	1	20	The Lord showed me four workers .
ERV	Zechariah	1	21	I asked him , “ What are these four workers coming to do ? ” He said , “ The horns represent the nations that attacked the people of Judah and forced them to go to foreign countries . The horns ‘ threw ’ the people of Judah to the foreign countries . The horns didn ’ t show mercy to anyone . But these four workers have come to frighten the horns and throw them away. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 1:1 the second year … Darius That is , about
ERV	Zechariah	1	520	B.C . Also in verse
ERV	Zechariah	2	2	I asked him , “ Where are you going ? ” He said to me , “ I am going to measure Jerusalem , to see how wide and how long it is. ”
ERV	Zechariah	2	3	Then the angel who was speaking to me left , and another angel went out to talk to him .
ERV	Zechariah	2	4	He said to him , “ Run and tell that young man this : ‘ Jerusalem will be a city without walls , because there will be too many people and animals living there. ’
ERV	Zechariah	2	5	The Lord says , ‘ I will be a wall of fire around her , to protect her , and to bring glory to that city , I will live there. ’ ” God Calls His People Home The Lord says ,
ERV	Zechariah	2	6	“ Hurry ! Leave the land in the North in a hurry . Yes , it is true that I scattered your people in every direction .
ERV	Zechariah	2	7	You people from Zion now live in Babylon . Escape ! Run away from that city ! ”
ERV	Zechariah	2	8	The Lord sent me to the nations that took away your wealth . He sent me to bring you honor . And this is what the Lord All-Powerful said : “ If anyone even touches you , it is as if they did it to the pupil of my eye .
ERV	Zechariah	2	9	Watch and see how I will punish them : Their own slaves will become their masters and take all their wealth. ” Then you will know it was the Lord All-Powerful who sent me to tell you these things .
ERV	Zechariah	2	10	The Lord says , “ Zion , be happy , because I am coming , and I will live in your city .
ERV	Zechariah	2	11	At that time people from many nations will come to me . They will become my people , and I will live in your city. ” Then you will know it was the Lord All-Powerful who sent me to tell you these things .
ERV	Zechariah	2	12	The Lord will again choose Jerusalem to be his special city . Judah will be his share of the holy land .
ERV	Zechariah	2	13	Everyone , be quiet ! The Lord is coming out of his holy house .
ERV	Zechariah	3	3	Joshua was wearing a dirty robe as he stood in front of the angel .
ERV	Zechariah	3	2	Then the angel of the Lord said , “ The Lord says that you are wrong , and he will continue to correct you ! The Lord has chosen Jerusalem to be his special city . He saved that city—it was like a burning stick pulled from the fire. ”
ERV	Zechariah	3	4	Then the angel said to the other angels standing near him , “ Take those dirty clothes off Joshua. ” Then the angel spoke to Joshua . He said , “ Now , I have taken away your guilt , and I am giving you a new change of clothes. ”
ERV	Zechariah	3	5	Then I said , “ Put a clean turban on his head. ” So they put the clean turban on him and also put clean clothes on him while the Lord ’ s angel stood there .
ERV	Zechariah	3	6	Then the Lord ’ s angel said this to Joshua :
ERV	Zechariah	3	7	This is what the Lord All-Powerful said : “ Live the way I tell you , and do everything I say . And you will be in charge of my Temple . You will take care of its courtyard . You will be free to go anywhere in my Temple , just as these angels standing here .
ERV	Zechariah	3	8	Listen , Joshua , you who are the high priest , and listen , you fellow priests seated before him . You are all examples to show what will happen when I bring my special servant . He is called , the Branch .
ERV	Zechariah	3	9	Look , I put a special stone in front of Joshua . There are seven sides [ a ] on that stone . I will carve a special message on it . This will show that in one day , I will remove the guilt from this land. ”
ERV	Zechariah	3	10	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ At that time people will sit and talk with their friends and neighbors . They will invite each other to sit under the fig trees and grapevines. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 3:9 sides Literally , “ eyes . ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	4	Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me , “ Sir , what do these things mean ? ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	2	Then the angel asked me , “ What do you see ? ” I said , “ I see a solid gold lampstand . There are seven lamps [ a ] on the lampstand , and there is a bowl on top of it . There are seven tubes coming from the bowl . One tube goes to each lamp . The tubes bring the oil in the bowl to each of the lamps .
ERV	Zechariah	4	3	There are two olive trees by the bowl , one on the right side and one on the left side . These trees produce the oil for the lamps. ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	5	The angel speaking with me said , “ Don ’ t you know what these things are ? ” “ No sir , ” I said .
ERV	Zechariah	4	6	He said , “ This is the message from the Lord to Zerubbabel : ‘ Your help will not come from your own strength and power . No , your help will come from my Spirit. ’ This is what the Lord All-Powerful says .
ERV	Zechariah	4	7	That tall mountain will be like a flat place for Zerubbabel . He will build the Temple , and when the most important stone is put in place , the people will shout , ‘ Beautiful ! Beautiful ! ’ ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	8	The Lord ’ s message to me also said ,
ERV	Zechariah	4	9	“ Zerubbabel will lay the foundations for my Temple , and he will finish building it . Then you will know that the Lord All-Powerful sent me to you people .
ERV	Zechariah	4	10	People will not be ashamed of the small beginnings , and they will be very happy when they see Zerubbabel with the plumb line , [ b ] measuring and checking the finished building . Now the seven sides [ c ] of the stone you saw represent the eyes of the Lord looking in every direction . They see everything on earth. ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	11	Then I said to him , “ I saw one olive tree on the right side of the lampstand and one on the left side . What do those two olive trees mean ? ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	12	I also said to him , “ I saw two olive branches by the gold tubes with gold colored oil flowing from them . What do these things mean ? ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	13	Then the angel said to me , “ Don ’ t you know what these things mean ? ” I said , “ No , sir. ”
ERV	Zechariah	4	14	So he said , “ They represent the two men chosen [ d ] to serve the Lord of the whole world. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 4:2 lamps These lamps made light by burning olive oil . - Zechariah 4:10 plumb line A string with a weight on one end used to show how straight the walls of a building were .

The Hebrew word also means “ eyes. ” - Zechariah 4:14 men chosen Literally , “ sons of extra pure olive oil. ” Often a special oil was poured over new kings , priests , and prophets . This showed that these people were chosen by God .
ERV	Zechariah	5	5	The angel who was talking to me went outside and said , “ Look ! What do you see coming ? ”
ERV	Zechariah	5	2	The angel asked me , “ What do you see ? ” I said , “ I see a flying scroll that is
ERV	Zechariah	5	30	feet Literally , “
ERV	Zechariah	5	15	feet Literally , “
ERV	Zechariah	5	3	Then the angel told me , “ There is a curse written on that scroll . On one side of the scroll , there is a curse against thieves and on the other side is a curse against people who lie when they make promises .
ERV	Zechariah	5	4	The Lord All-Powerful says , ‘ I will send that scroll to the houses of thieves and people who lie when they use my name to make promises . That scroll will settle there and destroy even the stones and wooden posts of their houses. ’ ” The Woman and the Bucket
ERV	Zechariah	5	6	I said , “ I don ’ t know . What is it ? ” He said , “ That is a measuring bucket. ” He also said , “ That bucket is for measuring the sins [ c ] of the people in this country. ”
ERV	Zechariah	5	7	A lid made of lead was lifted off the bucket , and there was a woman in the bucket .
ERV	Zechariah	5	8	The angel said , “ The woman represents evil. ” Then the angel pushed the woman down into the bucket and put the lead lid back on it .
ERV	Zechariah	5	9	Then I looked up and saw two women with wings like a stork . They flew out , and with the wind in their wings , they picked up the bucket . They flew through the air carrying the bucket .

ERV	Zechariah	6	7	The red spotted horses were anxious to go look at their part of the earth , so the angel told them , “ Go walk through the earth. ” So they went walking through their part of the earth .
ERV	Zechariah	6	8	Then he shouted at me and said , “ Look , those horses that were going north finished their job in Babylon . They have calmed my spirit ; I am not angry now ! ” Joshua the Priest Gets a Crown
ERV	Zechariah	6	9	Then I received another message from the Lord . He said ,
ERV	Zechariah	6	10	“ Heldai , Tobijah , and Jedaiah have come from the captives [ b ] in Babylon . Get silver and gold from these men and then go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah .
ERV	Zechariah	6	11	Use the silver and gold to make a crown . Put it on the head of the high priest , Joshua son of Jehozadak .

ERV	Zechariah	6	15	People living far away will come and build the Lord ’ s Temple . Then you will know for sure that the Lord All-Powerful sent me to you people .

ERV	Zechariah	7	2	The people of Bethel sent Sharezer , Regem-Melech , and his men to ask the Lord a question .
ERV	Zechariah	7	3	They went to the prophets and to the priests at the Temple of the Lord All-Powerful . They asked them this question : “ For many years we have shown our sadness for the destruction of the Temple . In the fifth month of each year , we have had a special time of crying and fasting . Should we continue to do this ? ”
ERV	Zechariah	7	4	I received this message from the Lord All-Powerful :
ERV	Zechariah	7	5	“ Tell the priests and the other people in this country this : ‘ For seventy years you fasted and showed your sadness in the fifth month and in the seventh month . But was that fasting really for me ?
ERV	Zechariah	7	6	And when you ate and drank , was that for me ? No , it was for your own good .
ERV	Zechariah	7	8	This is the Lord ’ s message to Zechariah :
ERV	Zechariah	7	9	“ This is what the Lord All-Powerful said : ‘ You must do what is right and fair . You must be kind and show mercy to each other .
ERV	Zechariah	7	10	Don ’ t hurt widows and orphans , strangers , or poor people . Don ’ t even think of doing bad things to each other ! ’ ”
ERV	Zechariah	7	11	But they refused to listen and refused to do what he wanted . They closed their ears so that they could not hear what God said .
ERV	Zechariah	7	12	They were very stubborn and would not obey the law . The Lord All-Powerful used his Spirit and sent messages to his people through the prophets . But the people would not listen , so the Lord All-Powerful became very angry .
ERV	Zechariah	7	13	So the Lord All-Powerful said , “ I called to them , and they did not answer . So now , if they call to me , I will not answer .
ERV	Zechariah	7	14	I will bring the other nations against them like a storm . They didn ’ t know those nations , but the country will be destroyed after those nations pass through . This pleasant country will be destroyed. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 7:1 the fourth year … Darius This was about

ERV	Zechariah	8	9	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ Be strong ! You people are hearing the same message today that the prophets gave when the Lord All-Powerful first laid the foundations to rebuild his Temple .
ERV	Zechariah	8	10	Before that time , people didn ’ t have the money to hire workers or to rent animals . And it was not safe for people to come and go . There was no relief from all the troubles . I had turned everyone against their neighbor .

ERV	Zechariah	8	18	I received this message from the Lord All-Powerful .
ERV	Zechariah	8	19	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ You have special days of sadness and fasting in the fourth month , the fifth month , the seventh month , and the tenth month . [ a ] These days of sadness must be changed into days of happiness . They will be good and happy festivals . And you must love truth and peace. ”

ERV	Zechariah	9	4	But the Lord will take it all . He will destroy her powerful navy and that city will be destroyed by fire !
ERV	Zechariah	9	5	The people in Ashkelon will see this and they will be afraid . The people of Gaza will shake with fear , and the people of Ekron will lose all hope when they see this happen . There will be no king left in Gaza . No one will live in Ashkelon anymore .
ERV	Zechariah	9	6	The people in Ashdod will not even know who their real fathers are . The Lord says , “ I will completely destroy the proud Philistines .
ERV	Zechariah	9	7	They will no longer eat meat with the blood still in it or any other forbidden food . Any Philistine left alive will become a part of my people ; they will be just one more tribe in Judah . The people of Ekron will become a part of my people , as the Jebusites did .
ERV	Zechariah	9	8	I will protect my country . I will not let enemy armies pass through it . I will not let them hurt my people anymore . With my own eyes I have seen how much my people have suffered. ” The Future King
ERV	Zechariah	9	10	I will take the war chariots away from Ephraim and the horse soldiers from Jerusalem . I will destroy the bows used in war . Your king will bring news of peace to the nations . He will rule from sea to sea , from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth . The Lord Will Save His People
ERV	Zechariah	9	11	Jerusalem , we used blood to seal your agreement , so I am setting your people free from that empty hole in the ground . [ c ]
ERV	Zechariah	9	12	Prisoners , go home ! Now you have something to hope for . I am telling you now , I am coming back to you .
ERV	Zechariah	9	13	Judah , I will use you like a bow . Ephraim , I will use you like arrows . Israel , I will use you like a sword to fight against the men of Greece .
ERV	Zechariah	9	14	The Lord will appear to them , and he will shoot his arrows like lightning . The Lord God will blow the trumpet , and the army will rush forward like a desert dust storm .
ERV	Zechariah	9	15	The Lord All-Powerful will protect them . The soldiers will use rocks and slings to defeat the enemy . They will spill the blood of their enemies . It will flow like wine . It will be like the blood that is thrown on the corners of the altar !
ERV	Zechariah	9	16	At that time the Lord their God will save his people like a shepherd saves his sheep . They will be very precious to him . They will be like sparkling jewels in his land .
ERV	Zechariah	9	17	Everything will be good and beautiful ! There will be a wonderful crop , but it will not be just the food and wine . It will be all the young men and women !

ERV	Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back from Egypt and Assyria . I will bring them to the area of Gilead . And since there will not be enough room , I will also let them live in nearby Lebanon .
ERV	Zechariah	10	2	People use their little statues and magic to learn what will happen in the future , but that is useless . They see visions and tell about their dreams , but it is nothing but worthless lies . So the people are like sheep wandering here and there crying for help , but there is no shepherd to lead them .
ERV	Zechariah	10	3	The Lord says , “ I am very angry with the shepherds . I made them responsible for what happens to my sheep. ” ( The people of Judah are his flock , and the Lord All-Powerful really does take care of his flock . He cares for them as a soldier cares for his beautiful war horse . )
ERV	Zechariah	10	4	“ The cornerstone , the tent peg , the war bow , and the advancing soldiers will all come from Judah together .
ERV	Zechariah	10	5	They will defeat their enemy—it will be like soldiers marching through mud in the streets . They will fight , and since the Lord is with them , they will defeat even the enemy soldiers riding horses .
ERV	Zechariah	10	6	I will make Judah ’ s family strong . I will help Joseph ’ s family win the war . I will bring them back safely and comfort them . It will be as if I never left them . I am the Lord their God , and I will help them .
ERV	Zechariah	10	7	The people of Ephraim will be as happy as soldiers who have too much to drink . Their children will be rejoicing and they , too , will be happy . They will all have a happy time together with the Lord .
ERV	Zechariah	10	8	“ I will whistle for them and call them all together . I really will save them . There will be many people .
ERV	Zechariah	10	9	Yes , I have been scattering my people throughout the nations . But in those faraway places , they will remember me . They and their children will survive , and they will come back .
ERV	Zechariah	10	11	They will go through a sea of troubles , but the waves will be stopped . Even the deepest waters of the Nile River will dry up . I will destroy Assyria ’ s pride and take away Egypt ’ s power .
ERV	Zechariah	10	12	I , the Lord , will make my people strong , and they will live for me. ” This is what the Lord said .
ERV	Zechariah	11	11	So that day the agreement was finished , and those poor sheep watching me knew that this message was from the Lord .
ERV	Zechariah	11	2	The cypress trees will cry because the cedar trees have fallen . Those powerful trees will be taken away . Oak trees in Bashan will cry for the forest that was cut down .
ERV	Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the crying shepherds . Their powerful leaders were taken away . Listen to the roaring of the young lions . Their thick bushes near the Jordan River have all been taken away .
ERV	Zechariah	11	4	The Lord my God says , “ Care for the sheep that have been raised to be killed .
ERV	Zechariah	11	5	Buyers kill their sheep and are not punished . Those who sell the sheep say , ‘ Praise the Lord , I am rich ! ’ The shepherds don ’ t feel sorry for their sheep .
ERV	Zechariah	11	6	And I don ’ t feel sorry for the people who live in this country. ” This is what the Lord said : “ Look , I will let everyone be under the control of their neighbor and king . I will let them destroy the country—I will not stop them ! ”
ERV	Zechariah	11	7	So I took care of the sheep that had been raised to be killed—those poor sheep . I found two sticks . I called one stick Favor , and I called the other stick Union . Then I began caring for the sheep .
ERV	Zechariah	11	8	I fired the three shepherds all in one month . I got angry at the sheep , and they began to hate me .
ERV	Zechariah	11	9	Then I said , “ I quit ! I will not take care of you ! I will let those who want to die , die . I will let those who want to be destroyed , be destroyed , and those who are left will destroy each other. ”
ERV	Zechariah	11	10	Then I took the stick named Favor , and I broke it . I did this to show that God ’ s agreement with his people was broken .
ERV	Zechariah	11	12	Then I said , “ If you want to pay me , pay me . If not , don ’ t ! ” So they paid me
ERV	Zechariah	11	30	pieces of silver and threw them into the treasury at the Lord ’ s Temple .
ERV	Zechariah	11	13	Then the Lord told me , “ So that ’ s how much they think I ’ m worth . Throw that large amount of money [ b ] into the Temple treasury. ” So I took the
ERV	Zechariah	11	14	Then I cut the stick named Union into two pieces . I did this to show that the union between Judah and Israel had been broken .
ERV	Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord said to me , “ Now , get the things a foolish shepherd might use .
ERV	Zechariah	11	16	This will show that I will get a new shepherd for this country . But this young man will not be able to take care of the sheep that are being destroyed . He will not be able to heal the hurt sheep or feed those that are left alive . And the healthy ones will be eaten completely—only their hoofs will be left. ”
ERV	Zechariah	11	17	Too bad for you , you worthless shepherd ! You abandoned my sheep . Punish him ! Strike his arm and right eye with a sword . His arm will be useless . His right eye will be blind .

This was only the amount of money a person paid for a slave .
ERV	Zechariah	12	12	Each and every family will cry by itself . The men in David ’ s family will cry by themselves , and their wives will cry by themselves . The men in Nathan ’ s family will cry by themselves , and their wives will cry by themselves .
ERV	Zechariah	12	2	“ Look , I will make Jerusalem like a cup of poison to the nations around her . The nations will come and attack that city , and all of Judah will be caught in the trap .
ERV	Zechariah	12	3	But I will make Jerusalem like a heavy rock—those who try to take it will hurt themselves . They will be cut and scratched . All the nations on earth will come together to fight against Jerusalem .
ERV	Zechariah	12	4	But at that time I will scare the horse , and the soldier riding it will panic . I will make all the enemy horses blind , but my eyes will be open—and I will be watching over Judah ’ s family .
ERV	Zechariah	12	5	The leaders of Judah will encourage the people and say , ‘ The Lord All-Powerful is your God . He makes us strong. ’
ERV	Zechariah	12	6	At that time I will make the leaders of Judah like a fire burning in a forest . They will destroy their enemies like fire burning straw . They will destroy the enemy all around them , and the people in Jerusalem will again be able to sit back and relax. ”
ERV	Zechariah	12	7	The Lord will save the people of Judah first , so the people in Jerusalem will not be able to brag too much . David ’ s family and the other people who live in Jerusalem will not be able to brag that they are better than the other people in Judah .
ERV	Zechariah	12	8	But the Lord will protect the people in Jerusalem . Even the man who trips and falls will become a great soldier like David . And the men from David ’ s family will be like gods—like the Lord ’ s own angel leading the people .
ERV	Zechariah	12	9	The Lord says , “ At that time I will destroy the nations that came to fight against Jerusalem .
ERV	Zechariah	12	10	I will fill David ’ s family and the people living in Jerusalem with a spirit of kindness and mercy . They will look to me , the one they stabbed , and they will be very sad . They will be as sad as someone crying over the death of their only son , as sad as someone crying over the death of their firstborn son .
ERV	Zechariah	12	11	There will be a time of great sadness and crying in Jerusalem . It will be like the time people cry over the death of Hadad Rimmon [ a ] in Megiddo Valley .
ERV	Zechariah	12	13	The men in Levi ’ s family will cry by themselves , and their wives will cry by themselves . The men in Simeon ’ s family will cry by themselves , and their wives will cry by themselves .
ERV	Zechariah	12	14	And the same thing will happen in all the other tribes . The men and women will cry by themselves. ” Footnotes - Zechariah 12:11 Hadad Rimmon Possibly a name for the Syrian fertility god .
ERV	Zechariah	13	13	But at that time a new spring of water will be opened for David ’ s family and for the other people living in Jerusalem . That fountain will be to wash away their sins and to make the people pure . No More False Prophets
ERV	Zechariah	13	2	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ At that time I will remove all the idols from the earth . People will not even remember their names , and I will remove the false prophets and unclean spirits from the earth .
ERV	Zechariah	13	3	Whoever continues to prophesy will be punished . Even their parents , their own mother and father , will say to them , ‘ You have spoken lies in the name of the Lord , so you must die ! ’ Their own mother and father will stab them for prophesying .
ERV	Zechariah	13	4	At that time the prophets will be ashamed of their visions and prophecies . They will not wear the rough cloth that shows a person is a prophet . They will not wear those clothes to trick people with the lies they call prophecies .
ERV	Zechariah	13	5	They will say , ‘ I am not a prophet . I am a farmer . I have worked as a farmer since I was a little child. ’
ERV	Zechariah	13	6	But other people will say , ‘ Then what are these wounds in your hands ? ’ He will say , ‘ I was beaten in the house of my friends. ’ ”
ERV	Zechariah	13	7	The Lord All-Powerful says , “ Sword , wake up and strike the shepherd , my friend ! Strike the shepherd , and the sheep will run away . And I will punish those little ones .
ERV	Zechariah	13	8	Two-thirds of the people in the land will be struck down and die , ” says the Lord , “ but one-third will survive .
ERV	Zechariah	13	9	Then I will test those survivors by giving them many troubles . The troubles will be like the fire a person uses to prove silver is pure . I will test them the way a person tests gold . Then they will call to me for help , and I will answer them . I will say , ‘ You are my people. ’ And they will say , ‘ The Lord is my God . ’ ”
ERV	Zechariah	14	14	Look , the Lord has a special day of judgment coming , when the riches you have taken will be divided in your city .
ERV	Zechariah	14	2	I will bring all the nations together to fight against Jerusalem . They will capture the city and destroy the houses . The women will be raped , and half of the people will be taken away as prisoners . But the rest of the people will not be taken from the city .
ERV	Zechariah	14	3	Then the Lord will go to war with those nations . It will be a real battle .
ERV	Zechariah	14	4	At that time he will stand on the Mount of Olives , the hill east of Jerusalem . The Mount of Olives will split in half . Part of the mountain will move to the north , and part to the south . A deep valley will open up , from the east to the west .
ERV	Zechariah	14	5	You will try to run away as that mountain valley comes closer and closer to you . You will run away like the time you ran from the earthquake during the time of King Uzziah of Judah . But the Lord my God will come , and all his holy ones [ a ] will be with him . 6-7 That will be a very special day . There will not be any light , cold , or frost . Only the Lord knows how , but there will not be any day or night . Then , when darkness usually comes , there will still be light .
ERV	Zechariah	14	8	At that time water will flow continually from Jerusalem . [ b ] That stream will split and part of it will flow east , and part of it will flow west to the Mediterranean Sea . And it will flow all year long , in the summer as well as in the winter .
ERV	Zechariah	14	9	And the Lord will be the King of the whole world . At that time all people will worship him as the only Lord with only one name .
ERV	Zechariah	14	10	And the whole land from Geba in the north to Rimmon in the south past Jerusalem will become a flat plain . The city of Jerusalem will stay in the same place , but it will be built high above the land around it . It will reach from the Benjamin Gate to the First Gate ( that is , the Corner Gate ) and from the Tower of Hananel to the king ’ s winepresses .
ERV	Zechariah	14	11	People will move to Jerusalem because it will be a safe place to live . It will never again be destroyed .
ERV	Zechariah	14	12	But the Lord will punish the nations that fought against Jerusalem . He will send a terrible disease against them . Their skin will begin to rot while the people are still alive . Their eyes will rot in their sockets , and their tongues will rot in their mouths . 13-15 That terrible disease will be in the enemy camp , and all their horses , mules , camels , and donkeys will catch that terrible disease . At that time they will be afraid of the Lord . Each man will grab his neighbor ’ s hand , and they will fight each other . Even Judah will fight against Jerusalem . This will happen even while armies from all the nations are surrounding the city . There will be much gold , silver , and clothing .
ERV	Zechariah	14	16	Some of the people who came to fight Jerusalem will survive . And every year they will come to worship the king , the Lord All-Powerful . They will come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters .
ERV	Zechariah	14	17	And if people from any of the families on earth don ’ t go to Jerusalem to worship the King , the Lord All-Powerful , no rain will fall on their land .
ERV	Zechariah	14	18	If any of the families in Egypt don ’ t come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters , they will get that terrible disease that the Lord caused the enemy nations to get .
ERV	Zechariah	14	19	That will be the punishment for Egypt , and for any other nation that does not come to celebrate the Festival of Shelters .
ERV	Zechariah	14	20	At that time even the harnesses on the horses will have the label , holy to the lord . [ c ] And all the pots used in the Lord ’ s Temple will be just as important as the bowls used at the altar .
ERV	Zechariah	14	21	In fact , every dish in Jerusalem and Judah will have the label , holy to the lord all-powerful . All the people offering sacrifices will come , take those dishes , and cook their special meals in them . At that time there will not be any merchants buying and selling things [ d ] in the Temple of the Lord All-Powerful .

ERV	Malachi	1	1	This is a message from the Lord to Israel . God used Malachi to tell this message to the people . God Loves Israel
ERV	Malachi	1	2	The Lord said , “ I love you people. ” But you said , “ What shows you love us ? ” The Lord said , “ Esau was Jacob ’ s brother , but I chose [ a ] Jacob .
ERV	Malachi	1	3	And I did not accept [ b ] Esau . I destroyed his hill country . [ c ] His country was destroyed , and now only wild dogs [ d ] live there. ”
ERV	Malachi	1	4	The people of Edom might say , “ We were destroyed , but we will go back and rebuild our cities. ” But the Lord All-Powerful says , “ If they rebuild their cities , I will destroy them again. ” That is why people say Edom is an evil country—a nation the Lord hates forever .
ERV	Malachi	1	5	You people saw these things , and you said , “ The Lord is great , even outside of Israel ! ” The People Don ’ t Respect God
ERV	Malachi	1	6	The Lord All-Powerful said , “ Children honor their fathers . Servants honor their masters . I am your Father , so why don ’ t you honor me ? I am your master , so why don ’ t you respect me ? You priests don ’ t respect my name . “ But you say , ‘ What have we done that shows we don ’ t respect your name ? ’
ERV	Malachi	1	7	“ You bring unclean bread to my altar . “ But you ask , ‘ What makes that bread unclean ? ’ “ It is unclean because you show no respect for the altar of the Lord .
ERV	Malachi	1	8	You bring blind animals as sacrifices , and that is wrong . You bring sick and crippled animals for sacrifices , and that is wrong . Try giving those sick animals as a gift to your governor . Would he accept those sick animals ? No , he would not accept them. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	1	9	“ Now try asking God to be good to you . But he will not listen to you , and it is all your fault. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	1	10	“ I wish one of you would close the Temple doors to stop the lighting of useless fires on my altar . I am not pleased with you . I will not accept your gifts. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	1	11	“ People all around the world respect my name . All around the world they bring good gifts to me and burn good incense as a gift to me , because my name is important to all of them. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	1	12	“ But you people show that you don ’ t respect my name . You say that the Lord ’ s altar is unclean . And you don ’ t like the food from that altar .
ERV	Malachi	1	13	You smell the food and refuse to eat it . You say it is bad . Then you bring sick , crippled , and hurt animals to me . You try to give sick animals to me as sacrifices , but I will not accept them. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	1	14	“ Some people have good , male animals that they could give as sacrifices , but don ’ t . Some people bring good animals and promise to give those healthy animals to me . But then they secretly exchange those good animals and give me sick animals instead . Bad things will happen to those people .

You will say blessings , [ a ] but they will become curses . I will make bad things happen because you don ’ t show respect for my name. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	2	3	“ Look , I will punish your descendants . During the festivals , you priests offer sacrifices to me . You take the dung and inside parts from the dead animals and throw them away . But I will smear the dung on your faces , and you will be thrown away with it !
ERV	Malachi	2	4	Then you will learn why I am giving you this command . I am telling you these things so that my agreement with Levi will continue. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	2	5	The Lord said , “ I made that agreement with Levi . I promised to give him life and peace—and I gave him those things . Levi respected me and showed honor to my name .
ERV	Malachi	2	6	He taught the true teachings and didn ’ t teach lies . Levi was honest , and he loved peace . He followed me and saved many people from being punished for the evil things they did .
ERV	Malachi	2	7	A priest should know God ’ s teachings . People should be able to go to a priest and learn God ’ s teachings . A priest should be the Lord ’ s messenger to the people .
ERV	Malachi	2	8	“ But you priests stopped following me ! You used the teachings to make people do wrong . You ruined the agreement with Levi. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said .
ERV	Malachi	2	9	“ You don ’ t live the way I told you . You have not accepted my teachings . So I will cause people to hate you and think you are worth nothing. ” Judah Was Not True to God
ERV	Malachi	2	10	We all have the same father . The same God made every one of us . So why do people cheat one another ? They show that they don ’ t respect the agreement . They don ’ t respect the agreement that our ancestors made with God .
ERV	Malachi	2	11	The people of Judah cheated other people . People in Jerusalem and Israel did terrible things . God loves the Temple , but the people in Judah didn ’ t respect the Lord ’ s holy Temple . The people of Judah began to worship a foreign goddess .
ERV	Malachi	2	12	The Lord will remove them from Judah ’ s family . They might bring gifts to the Lord All-Powerful—but it will not help .
ERV	Malachi	2	13	You can cry and cover the Lord ’ s altar with tears , but the Lord will not accept your gifts . He will not be pleased with the things you bring to him .
ERV	Malachi	2	14	You ask , “ Why are our gifts not accepted ? ” It is because the Lord saw the evil things you did—he is a witness against you . He saw you cheat on your wife . You have been married to her since you were young . She was your girlfriend . Then you made your vows to each other—and she became your wife .
ERV	Malachi	2	15	God wants husbands and wives to become one body and one spirit . Why ? So that they would have holy children and protect that spiritual unity . Don ’ t cheat on your wife . She has been your wife from the time you were young .
ERV	Malachi	2	16	The Lord , the God of Israel , says , “ I hate divorce , and I hate the cruel things that men do . So protect your spiritual unity . Don ’ t cheat on your wife. ” The Special Time of Judgment

ERV	Malachi	3	4	Then the Lord will accept the gifts from Judah and Jerusalem . It will be as it was in the past—as the time long ago .
ERV	Malachi	3	5	Then I will bring you to justice . I will be an expert witness and testify about the evil things people do . I will speak out against those who do evil magic or commit adultery . I will speak out against those who make false promises and cheat their workers and don ’ t pay them the money they promised . I will testify against those who don ’ t help strangers , or widows and orphans . And I will testify against those who don ’ t respect me. ” This is what the Lord All-Powerful said . Stealing From God

ERV	Malachi	3	8	“ People should not steal things from God , but you stole things from me . “ You say , ‘ What did we steal from you ? ’ “ You should have given me one-tenth of your things . You should have given me special gifts .
