DRA	Matthew	1	17	So all the generations , from Abraham to David , are fourteen generations . And from David to the transmigration of Babylon , are fourteen generations : and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations .
DRA	Matthew	1	18	Now the generation of Christ was in this wise . When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child , of the Holy Ghost .
DRA	Matthew	1	19	Whereupon Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing publicly to expose her , was minded to put her away privately .
DRA	Matthew	1	20	But while he thought on these things , behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep , saying : Joseph , son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife , for that which is conceived in her , is of the Holy Ghost .
DRA	Matthew	1	21	And she shall bring forth a son : and thou shalt call his name JESUS . For he shall save his people from their sins .

DRA	Matthew	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	2	3	And king Herod hearing this , was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
DRA	Matthew	2	4	And assembling together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people , he inquired of them where Christ should be born .
DRA	Matthew	2	5	But they said to him : In Bethlehem of Juda . For so it is written by the prophet :
DRA	Matthew	2	6	And thou Bethlehem the land of Juda art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come forth the captain that shall rule my people Israel .
DRA	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , privately calling the wise men , learned diligently of them the time of the star which appeared to them ;
DRA	Matthew	2	8	And sending them into Bethlehem , said : Go and diligently inquire after the child , and when you have found him , bring me word again , that I also may come to adore him .
DRA	Matthew	2	9	Who having heard the king , went their way ; and behold the star which they had seen in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the child was .
DRA	Matthew	2	10	And seeing the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
DRA	Matthew	2	11	And entering into the house , they found the child with Mary his mother , and falling down they adored him ; and opening their treasures , they offered him gifts ; gold , frankincense , and myrrh .
DRA	Matthew	2	12	And having received an answer in sleep that they should not return to Herod , they went back another way into their country .
DRA	Matthew	2	13	And after they were departed , behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph , saying : Arise , and take the child and his mother , and fly into Egypt : and be there until I shall tell thee . For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him .
DRA	Matthew	2	14	Who arose , and took the child and his mother by night , and retired into Egypt : and he was there until the death of Herod :
DRA	Matthew	2	15	That it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet , saying : Out of Egypt have I called my son .
DRA	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod perceiving that he was deluded by the wise men , was exceeding angry ; and sending killed all the men children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the borders thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men .
DRA	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet , saying :
DRA	Matthew	2	18	A voice in Rama was heard , lamentation and great mourning ; Rachel bewailing her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
DRA	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod was dead , behold an angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt ,
DRA	Matthew	2	20	Saying : Arise , and take the child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel . For they are dead that sought the life of the child .
DRA	Matthew	2	21	Who arose , and took the child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .

DRA	Matthew	3	2	And saying : Do penance : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
DRA	Matthew	3	4	And the same John had his garment of camels ' hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins : and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
DRA	Matthew	3	5	Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea , and all the country about Jordan :
DRA	Matthew	3	6	And were baptized by him in the Jordan , confessing their sins .
DRA	Matthew	3	7	And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said to them : Ye brood of vipers , who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come ?
DRA	Matthew	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance .
DRA	Matthew	3	9	And think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham for our father . For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham .
DRA	Matthew	3	10	For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees . Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit , shall be cut down , and cast into the fire .
DRA	Matthew	3	11	I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance , but he that shall come after me , is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear ; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire .
DRA	Matthew	3	12	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn ; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire .
DRA	Matthew	3	13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan , unto John , to be baptized by him .
DRA	Matthew	3	14	But John stayed him , saying : I ought to be baptized by thee , and comest thou to me ?
DRA	Matthew	3	15	And Jesus answering , said to him : Suffer it to be so now . For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice . Then he suffered him .
DRA	Matthew	3	16	And Jesus being baptized , forthwith came out of the water : and lo , the heavens were opened to him : and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him .
DRA	Matthew	3	17	And behold a voice from heaven , saying : This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	4	2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , afterwards he was hungry .
DRA	Matthew	4	3	And the tempter coming said to him : If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
DRA	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil took him up into the holy city , and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple ,
DRA	Matthew	4	6	And said to him : If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down , for it is written : That he hath given his angels charge over thee , and in their hands shall they bear thee up , lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone .
DRA	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him : It is written again : Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
DRA	Matthew	4	8	Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain , and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ,
DRA	Matthew	4	9	And said to him : All these will I give thee , if falling down thou wilt adore me .
DRA	Matthew	4	10	Then Jesus saith to him : Begone , Satan : for it is written , The Lord thy God shalt thou adore , and him only shalt thou serve .
DRA	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil left him ; and behold angels came and ministered to him .
DRA	Matthew	4	12	And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up , he retired into Galilee :
DRA	Matthew	4	13	And leaving the city Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim ;
DRA	Matthew	4	14	That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet :
DRA	Matthew	4	15	Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim , the way of the sea beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles :
DRA	Matthew	4	16	The people that sat in darkness , hath seen great light : and to them that sat in the region of the shadow of death , light is sprung up .
DRA	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say : Do penance , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
DRA	Matthew	4	18	And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ( for they were fishers ) .
DRA	Matthew	4	19	And he saith to them : Come ye after me , and I will make you to be fishers of men .
DRA	Matthew	4	20	And they immediately leaving their nets , followed him .
DRA	Matthew	4	21	And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets : and he called them .
DRA	Matthew	4	22	And they forthwith left their nets and father , and followed him .
DRA	Matthew	4	23	And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom : and healing all manner of sickness and every infirmity , among the people .
DRA	Matthew	4	24	And his fame went throughout all Syria , and they presented to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and such as were possessed by devils , and lunatics , and those that had palsy , and he cured them :
DRA	Matthew	4	25	And much people followed him from Galilee , and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem , and from Judea , and from beyond the Jordan . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	5	11	Blessed are ye when they shall revile you , and persecute you , and speak all that is evil against you , untruly , for my sake :
DRA	Matthew	5	12	Be glad and rejoice , for your reward is very great in heaven . For so they persecuted the prophets that were before you .
DRA	Matthew	5	13	You are the salt of the earth . But if the salt lose its savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? It is good for nothing any more but to be cast out , and to be trodden on by men .
DRA	Matthew	5	14	You are the light of the world . A city seated on a mountain can not be hid .
DRA	Matthew	5	15	Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel , but upon a candlestick , that it may shine to all that are in the house .
DRA	Matthew	5	16	So let your light shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	5	17	Do not think that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets . I am not come to destroy , but to fulfill .
DRA	Matthew	5	18	For amen I say unto you , till heaven and earth pass , one jot , or one tittle shall not pass of the law , till all be fulfilled .
DRA	Matthew	5	19	He therefore that shall break one of these least commandments , and shall so teach men , shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven . But he that shall do and teach , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	5	20	For I tell you , that unless your justice abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees , you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	5	21	You have heard that it was said to them of old : Thou shalt not kill . And whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment .
DRA	Matthew	5	22	But I say to you , that whosoever is angry with his brother , shall be in danger of the judgment . And whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council . And whosoever shall say , Thou Fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
DRA	Matthew	5	23	If therefore thou offer thy gift at the altar , and there thou remember that thy brother hath any thing against thee ;
DRA	Matthew	5	24	Leave there thy offering before the altar , and go first to be reconciled to thy brother : and then coming thou shalt offer thy gift .
DRA	Matthew	5	25	Be at agreement with thy adversary betimes , whilst thou art in the way with him : lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
DRA	Matthew	5	26	Amen I say to thee , thou shalt not go out from thence till thou repay the last farthing .
DRA	Matthew	5	27	You have heard that it was said to them of old : Thou shalt not commit adultery .
DRA	Matthew	5	28	But I say to you , that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her , hath already committed adultery with her in his heart .
DRA	Matthew	5	29	And if thy right eye scandalize thee , pluck it out and cast it from thee . For it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish , rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell .
DRA	Matthew	5	30	And if thy right hand scandalize thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should perish , rather than that thy whole body be cast into hell .
DRA	Matthew	5	31	And it hath been said , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a bill of divorce .
DRA	Matthew	5	32	But I say to you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , excepting for the cause of fornication , maketh her to commit adultery : and he that shall marry her that is put away , committeth adultery .
DRA	Matthew	5	33	Again you have heard that it was said to them of old , Thou shalt not forswear thyself : but thou shalt perform thy oaths to the Lord .
DRA	Matthew	5	34	But I say to you not to swear at all , neither by heaven , for it is the throne of God :
DRA	Matthew	5	35	Nor by the earth , for it is his footstool : nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great king :
DRA	Matthew	5	36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
DRA	Matthew	5	37	But let your speech be yea , yea : no , no : and that which is over and above these , is of evil .
DRA	Matthew	5	38	You have heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth .
DRA	Matthew	5	39	But I say to you not to resist evil : but if one strike thee on thy right cheek , turn to him also the other :
DRA	Matthew	5	40	And if a man will contend with thee in judgment , and take away thy coat , let go thy cloak also unto him .
DRA	Matthew	5	41	And whosoever will force thee one mile , go with him other two ,
DRA	Matthew	5	42	Give to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not away .
DRA	Matthew	5	43	You have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thy enemy .
DRA	Matthew	5	44	But I say to you , Love your enemies : do good to them that hate you : and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you :
DRA	Matthew	5	45	That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven , who maketh his sun to rise upon the good , and bad , and raineth upon the just and the unjust .
DRA	Matthew	5	46	For if you love them that love you , what reward shall you have ? do not even the publicans this ?
DRA	Matthew	5	47	And if you salute your brethren only , what do you more ? do not also the heathens this ?
DRA	Matthew	5	48	Be you therefore perfect , as also your heavenly Father is perfect . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	6	6	But thou when thou shalt pray , enter into thy chamber , and having shut the door , pray to thy Father in secret : and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee .
DRA	Matthew	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	6	2	Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed , sound not a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may be honoured by men . Amen I say to you , they have received their reward .
DRA	Matthew	6	3	But when thou dost alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth .
DRA	Matthew	6	4	That thy alms may be in secret , and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee .
DRA	Matthew	6	5	And when ye pray , you shall not be as the hypocrites , that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets , that they may be seen by men : Amen I say to you , they have received their reward .
DRA	Matthew	6	7	And when you are praying , speak not much , as the heathens . For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard .
DRA	Matthew	6	8	Be not you therefore like to them , for your Father knoweth what is needful for you , before you ask him .
DRA	Matthew	6	9	Thus therefore shall you pray : Our Father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
DRA	Matthew	6	10	Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day our supersubstantial bread .
DRA	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors .
DRA	Matthew	6	13	And lead us not into temptation . But deliver us from evil . Amen .
DRA	Matthew	6	14	For if you will forgive men their offences , your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences .
DRA	Matthew	6	15	But if you will not forgive men , neither will your Father forgive you your offences .
DRA	Matthew	6	16	And when you fast , be not as the hypocrites , sad . For they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . Amen I say to you , they have received their reward .
DRA	Matthew	6	17	But thou , when thou fastest anoint thy head , and wash thy face ;
DRA	Matthew	6	18	That thou appear not to men to fast , but to thy Father who is in secret : and thy Father who seeth in secret , will repay thee .
DRA	Matthew	6	19	Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth : where the rust , and moth consume , and where thieves break through and steal .
DRA	Matthew	6	20	But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven : where neither the rust nor moth doth consume , and where thieves do not break through , nor steal .
DRA	Matthew	6	21	For where thy treasure is , there is thy heart also .
DRA	Matthew	6	22	The light of thy body is thy eye . If thy eye be single , thy whole body shall be lightsome .
DRA	Matthew	6	23	But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome . If then the light that is in thee , be darkness : the darkness itself how great shall it be !
DRA	Matthew	6	24	No man can serve two masters . For either he will hate the one , and love the other : or he will sustain the one , and despise the other . You can not serve God and mammon .
DRA	Matthew	6	25	Therefore I say to you , be not solicitous for your life , what you shall eat , nor for your body , what you shall put on . Is not the life more than the meat : and the body more than the raiment ?
DRA	Matthew	6	26	Behold the birds of the air , for they neither sow , nor do they reap , nor gather into barns : and your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are not you of much more value than they ?
DRA	Matthew	6	27	And which of you by taking thought , can add to his stature by one cubit ?
DRA	Matthew	6	28	And for raiment why are you solicitous ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow : they labour not , neither do they spin .
DRA	Matthew	6	29	But I say to you , that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these .
DRA	Matthew	6	30	And if the grass of the field , which is to day , and to morrow is cast into the oven , God doth so clothe : how much more you , O ye of little faith ?
DRA	Matthew	6	31	Be not solicitous therefore , saying , What shall we eat : or what shall we drink , or wherewith shall we be clothed ?
DRA	Matthew	6	32	For after all these things do the heathens seek . For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things .
DRA	Matthew	6	33	Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God , and his justice , and all these things shall be added unto you .
DRA	Matthew	6	34	Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow ; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself . Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	7	7	Ask , and it shall be given you : seek , and you shall find : knock , and it shall be opened to you .
DRA	Matthew	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	7	2	For with what judgment you judge , you shall be judged : and with what measure you mete , it shall be measured to you again .
DRA	Matthew	7	3	And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye ; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye ?
DRA	Matthew	7	4	Or how sayest thou to thy brother : Let me cast the mote out of thy eye ; and behold a beam is in thy own eye ?
DRA	Matthew	7	5	Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam in thy own eye , and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye .
DRA	Matthew	7	6	Give not that which is holy to dogs ; neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest perhaps they trample them under their feet , and turning upon you , they tear you .
DRA	Matthew	7	8	For every one that asketh , receiveth : and he that seeketh , findeth : and to him that knocketh , it shall be opened .
DRA	Matthew	7	9	Or what man is there among you , of whom if his son shall ask bread , will he reach him a stone ?
DRA	Matthew	7	10	Or if he shall ask him a fish , will he reach him a serpent ?
DRA	Matthew	7	11	If you then being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children : how much more will your Father who is in heaven , give good things to them that ask him ?
DRA	Matthew	7	12	All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you , do you also to them . For this is the law and the prophets .
DRA	Matthew	7	13	Enter ye in at the narrow gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction , and many there are who go in thereat .
DRA	Matthew	7	14	How narrow is the gate , and strait is the way that leadeth to life : and few there are that find it !
DRA	Matthew	7	15	Beware of false prophets , who come to you in the clothing of sheep , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
DRA	Matthew	7	16	By their fruits you shall know them . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
DRA	Matthew	7	17	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit , and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
DRA	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit .
DRA	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit , shall be cut down , and shall be cast into the fire .
DRA	Matthew	7	20	Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them .
DRA	Matthew	7	21	Not every one that saith to me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven : but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven , he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me in that day : Lord , Lord , have not we prophesied in thy name , and cast out devils in thy name , and done many miracles in thy name ?
DRA	Matthew	7	23	And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , you that work iniquity .
DRA	Matthew	7	24	Every one therefore that heareth these my words , and doth them , shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock ,
DRA	Matthew	7	25	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and they beat upon that house , and it fell not , for it was founded on a rock .
DRA	Matthew	7	26	And every one that heareth these my words , and doth them not , shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand ,
DRA	Matthew	7	27	And the rain fell , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and they beat upon that house , and it fell , and great was the fall thereof .
DRA	Matthew	7	28	And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words , the people were in admiration at his doctrine .
DRA	Matthew	7	29	For he was teaching them as one having power , and not as the scribes and Pharisees . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	8	11	And I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven :
DRA	Matthew	8	12	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
DRA	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said to the centurion : Go , and as thou hast believed , so be it done to thee . And the servant was healed at the same hour .
DRA	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying , and sick of a fever :

DRA	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Cananean , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
DRA	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent : commanding them , saying : Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles , and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not .
DRA	Matthew	10	6	But go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .

DRA	Matthew	11	2	Now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ : sending two of his disciples he said to him :
DRA	Matthew	11	3	Art thou he that art to come , or look we for another ?
DRA	Matthew	11	4	And Jesus making answer said to them : Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen .
DRA	Matthew	11	5	The blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead rise again , the poor have the gospel preached to them .
DRA	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he that shall not be scandalized in me .
DRA	Matthew	11	7	And when they went their way , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John : What went you out into the desert to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
DRA	Matthew	11	8	But what went you out to see ? a man clothed in soft garments ? Behold they that are clothed in soft garments , are in the houses of kings .
DRA	Matthew	11	9	But what went you out to see ? a prophet ? yea I tell you , and more than a prophet .
DRA	Matthew	11	10	For this is he of whom it is written : Behold I send my angel before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee .
DRA	Matthew	11	12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent bear it away .
DRA	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John :
DRA	Matthew	11	14	And if you will receive it , he is Elias that is to come .
DRA	Matthew	11	15	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
DRA	Matthew	11	16	But whereunto shall I esteem this generation to be like ? It is like to children sitting in the market place .
DRA	Matthew	11	17	Who crying to their companions say : We have piped to you , and you have not danced : we have lamented , and you have not mourned .
DRA	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking ; and they say : He hath a devil .
DRA	Matthew	11	19	The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say : Behold a man that is a glutton and a wine drinker , a friend of publicans and sinners . And wisdom is justified by her children .
DRA	Matthew	11	20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein were done the most of his miracles , for that they had not done penance .
DRA	Matthew	11	21	Woe to thee , Corozain , woe to thee , Bethsaida : for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you , they had long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes .
DRA	Matthew	11	22	But I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment , than for you .
DRA	Matthew	11	23	And thou Capharnaum , shalt thou be exalted up to heaven ? thou shalt go down even unto hell . For if in Sodom had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in thee , perhaps it had remained unto this day .
DRA	Matthew	11	24	But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
DRA	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus answered and said : I confess to thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to the little ones .
DRA	Matthew	11	26	Yea , Father ; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight .
DRA	Matthew	11	27	All things are delivered to me by my Father . And no one knoweth the Son , but the Father : neither doth any one know the Father , but the Son , and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him .

DRA	Matthew	12	12	How much better is a man than a sheep ? Therefore it is lawful to do a good deed on the sabbath days .
DRA	Matthew	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	12	2	And the Pharisees seeing them , said to him : Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days .
DRA	Matthew	12	3	But he said to them : Have you not read what David did when he was hungry , and they that were with him :
DRA	Matthew	12	4	How he entered into the house of God , and did eat the loaves of proposition , which it was not lawful for him to eat , nor for them that were with him , but for the priests only ?
DRA	Matthew	12	5	Or have ye not read in the law , that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple break the sabbath , and are without blame ?
DRA	Matthew	12	6	But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple .
DRA	Matthew	12	7	And if you knew what this meaneth : I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : you would never have condemned the innocent .
DRA	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath .
DRA	Matthew	12	9	And when he had passed from thence , he came into their synagogues .
DRA	Matthew	12	10	And behold there was a man who had a withered hand , and they asked him , saying : Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
DRA	Matthew	12	11	But he said to them : What man shall there be among you , that hath one sheep : and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not take hold on it and lift it up ?
DRA	Matthew	12	13	Then he saith to the man : Stretch forth thy hand ; and he stretched it forth , and it was restored to health even as the other .
DRA	Matthew	12	14	And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him , how they might destroy him .
DRA	Matthew	12	15	But Jesus knowing it , retired from thence : and many followed him , and he healed them all .
DRA	Matthew	12	16	And he charged them that they should not make him known .
DRA	Matthew	12	17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet , saying :
DRA	Matthew	12	18	Behold my servant whom I have chosen , my beloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased . I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles .
DRA	Matthew	12	19	He shall not contend , nor cry out , neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
DRA	Matthew	12	20	The bruised reed he shall not break : and smoking flax he shall not extinguish : till he send forth judgment unto victory .
DRA	Matthew	12	21	And in his name the Gentiles shall hope .
DRA	Matthew	12	22	Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil , blind and dumb : and he healed him , so that he spoke and saw .
DRA	Matthew	12	23	And all the multitudes were amazed , and said : Is not this the son of David ?
DRA	Matthew	12	24	But the Pharisees hearing it , said : This man casteth not out the devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
DRA	Matthew	12	25	And Jesus knowing their thoughts , said to them : Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate : and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand .
DRA	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself : how then shall his kingdom stand ?
DRA	Matthew	12	27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
DRA	Matthew	12	28	But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils , then is the kingdom of God come upon you .
DRA	Matthew	12	29	Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong , and rifle his goods , unless he first bind the strong ? and then he will rifle his house .
DRA	Matthew	12	30	He that is not with me , is against me : and he that gathereth not with me , scattereth .
DRA	Matthew	12	31	Therefore I say to you : Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men , but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven .
DRA	Matthew	12	32	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , nor in the world to come .
DRA	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good and its fruit good : or make the tree evil , and its fruit evil . For by the fruit the tree is known .
DRA	Matthew	12	34	O generation of vipers , how can you speak good things , whereas you are evil ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
DRA	Matthew	12	35	A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
DRA	Matthew	12	36	But I say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment .
DRA	Matthew	12	37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
DRA	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him , saying : Master we would see a sign from thee .
DRA	Matthew	12	39	Who answering said to them : An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign : and a sign shall not be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
DRA	Matthew	12	40	For as Jonas was in the whale 's belly three days and three nights : so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights .
DRA	Matthew	12	41	The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas . And behold a greater than Jonas here .
DRA	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold a greater than Solomon here .
DRA	Matthew	12	43	And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest , and findeth none .
DRA	Matthew	12	44	Then he saith : I will return into my house from whence I came out . And coming he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
DRA	Matthew	12	45	Then he goeth , and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is made worse than the first . So shall it be also to this wicked generation .
DRA	Matthew	12	46	As he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him .
DRA	Matthew	12	47	And one said unto him : Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without , seeking thee .
DRA	Matthew	12	48	But he answering him that told him , said : Who is my mother , and who are my brethren ?
DRA	Matthew	12	49	And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples , he said : Behold my mother and my brethren .
DRA	Matthew	12	50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father , that is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	13	13	Therefore do I speak to them in parables : because seeing they see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
DRA	Matthew	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	13	2	And great multitudes were gathered unto him , so that he went up into a boat and sat : and all the multitude stood on the shore .
DRA	Matthew	13	3	And he spoke to them many things in parables , saying : Behold the sower went forth to sow .
DRA	Matthew	13	4	And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side , and the birds of the air came and ate them up .
DRA	Matthew	13	5	And other some fell upon stony ground , where they had not much earth : and they sprung up immediately , because they had no deepness of earth .
DRA	Matthew	13	6	And when the sun was up they were scorched : and because they had not root , they withered away .
DRA	Matthew	13	7	And others fell among thorns : and the thorns grew up and choked them .
DRA	Matthew	13	8	And others fell upon good ground : and they brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , and some thirtyfold .
DRA	Matthew	13	9	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
DRA	Matthew	13	10	And his disciples came and said to him : Why speakest thou to them in parables ?
DRA	Matthew	13	11	Who answered and said to them : Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven : but to them it is not given .
DRA	Matthew	13	12	For he that hath , to him shall be given , and he shall abound : but he that hath not , from him shall be taken away that also which he hath .
DRA	Matthew	13	14	And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in them , who saith : By hearing you shall hear , and shall not understand : and seeing you shall see , and shall not perceive .
DRA	Matthew	13	15	For the heart of this people is grown gross , and with their ears they have been dull of hearing , and their eyes they have shut : lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
DRA	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes , because they see , and your ears , because they hear .
DRA	Matthew	13	17	For , amen , I say to you , many prophets and just men have desired to see the things that you see , and have not seen them , and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them .
DRA	Matthew	13	18	Hear you therefore the parable of the sower .
DRA	Matthew	13	19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , there cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart : this is he that received the seed by the way side .
DRA	Matthew	13	20	And he that received the seed upon stony ground , is he that heareth the word , and immediately receiveth it with joy .
DRA	Matthew	13	21	Yet hath he not root in himself , but is only for a time : and when there ariseth tribulation and persecution because of the word , he is presently scandalized .
DRA	Matthew	13	22	And he that received the seed among thorns , is he that heareth the word , and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choketh up the word , and he becometh fruitless .
DRA	Matthew	13	23	But he that received the seed upon good ground , is he that heareth the word , and understandeth , and beareth fruit , and yieldeth the one an hundredfold , and another sixty , and another thirty .
DRA	Matthew	13	24	Another parable he proposed to them , saying : The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seeds in his field .
DRA	Matthew	13	25	But while men were asleep , his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the wheat and went his way .
DRA	Matthew	13	26	And when the blade was sprung up , and had brought forth fruit , then appeared also the cockle .
DRA	Matthew	13	27	And the servants of the goodman of the house coming said to him : Sir , didst thou not sow good seed in thy field ? whence then hath it cockle ?
DRA	Matthew	13	28	And he said to them : An enemy hath done this . And the servants said to him : Wilt thou that we go and gather it up ?
DRA	Matthew	13	29	And he said : No , lest perhaps gathering up the cockle , you root up the wheat also together with it .
DRA	Matthew	13	30	Suffer both to grow until the harvest , and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers : Gather up first the cockle , and bind it into bundles to burn , but the wheat gather ye into my barn .
DRA	Matthew	13	31	Another parable he proposed unto them , saying : The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and sowed in his field .
DRA	Matthew	13	32	Which is the least indeed of all seeds ; but when it is grown up , it is greater than all herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come , and dwell in the branches thereof .
DRA	Matthew	13	33	Another parable he spoke to them : The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , until the whole was leavened .
DRA	Matthew	13	34	All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes : and without parables he did not speak to them .
DRA	Matthew	13	35	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying : I will open my mouth in parables , I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world .
DRA	Matthew	13	36	Then having sent away the multitudes , he came into the house , and his disciples came to him , saying : Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field .
DRA	Matthew	13	37	Who made answer and said to them : He that soweth the good seed , is the Son of man .
DRA	Matthew	13	38	And the field , is the world . And the good seed are the children of the kingdom . And the cockle , are the children of the wicked one .
DRA	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy that sowed them , is the devil . But the harvest is the end of the world . And the reapers are the angels .
DRA	Matthew	13	40	Even as cockle therefore is gathered up , and burnt with fire : so shall it be at the end of the world .
DRA	Matthew	13	41	The Son of man shall send his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals , and them that work iniquity .
DRA	Matthew	13	42	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
DRA	Matthew	13	43	Then shall the just shine as the sun , in the kingdom of their Father . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
DRA	Matthew	13	44	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field . Which a man having found , hid it , and for joy thereof goeth , and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
DRA	Matthew	13	45	Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls .
DRA	Matthew	13	46	Who when he had found one pearl of great price , went his way , and sold all that he had , and bought it .
DRA	Matthew	13	47	Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea , and gathering together of all kind of fishes .
DRA	Matthew	13	48	Which , when it was filled , they drew out , and sitting by the shore , they chose out the good into vessels , but the bad they cast forth .
DRA	Matthew	13	49	So shall it be at the end of the world . The angels shall go out , and shall separate the wicked from among the just .
DRA	Matthew	13	50	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
DRA	Matthew	13	51	Have ye understood all these things ? They say to him : Yes .
DRA	Matthew	13	52	He said unto them : Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven , is like to a man that is a householder , who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old .
DRA	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass : when Jesus had finished these parables , he passed from thence .
DRA	Matthew	13	54	And coming into his own country , he taught them in their synagogues , so that they wondered and said : How came this man by this wisdom and miracles ?
DRA	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter 's son ? Is not his mother called Mary , and his brethren James , and Joseph , and Simon , and Jude :
DRA	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence therefore hath he all these things ?
DRA	Matthew	13	57	And they were scandalized in his regard . But Jesus said to them : A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
DRA	Matthew	13	58	And he wrought not many miracles there , because of their unbelief . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	14	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	14	2	And he said to his servants : This is John the Baptist : he is risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works shew forth themselves in him .
DRA	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had apprehended John and bound him , and put him into prison , because of Herodias , his brother 's wife .
DRA	Matthew	14	4	For John said to him : It is not lawful for thee to have her .
DRA	Matthew	14	5	And having a mind to put him to death , he feared the people : because they esteemed him as a prophet .
DRA	Matthew	14	6	But on Herod 's birthday , the daughter of Herodias danced before them : and pleased Herod .
DRA	Matthew	14	7	Whereupon he promised with an oath , to give her whatsoever she would ask of him .
DRA	Matthew	14	8	But she being instructed before by her mother , said : Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist .
DRA	Matthew	14	9	And the king was struck sad : yet because of his oath , and for them that sat with him at table , he commanded it to be given .
DRA	Matthew	14	10	And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
DRA	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought in a dish : and it was given to the damsel , and she brought it to her mother .
DRA	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came and took the body , and buried it , and came and told Jesus .
DRA	Matthew	14	13	Which when Jesus had heard , he retired from thence by boat , into a desert place apart , and the multitudes having heard of it , followed him on foot out of the cities .
DRA	Matthew	14	15	And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying : This is a desert place , and the hour is now past : send away the multitudes , that going into the towns , they may buy themselves victuals .
DRA	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , They have no need to go : give you them to eat .
DRA	Matthew	14	17	They answered him : We have not here , but five loaves , and two fishes .
DRA	Matthew	14	18	He said to them : Bring them hither to me .
DRA	Matthew	14	19	And when he had commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the grass , he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes .
DRA	Matthew	14	20	And they did all eat , and were filled . And they took up what remained , twelve full baskets of fragments .
DRA	Matthew	14	21	And the number of them that did eat , was five thousand men , besides women and children .
DRA	Matthew	14	22	And forthwith Jesus obliged his disciples to go up into the boat , and to go before him over the water , till he dismissed the people .
DRA	Matthew	14	23	And having dismissed the multitude , he went into a mountain alone to pray . And when it was evening , he was there alone .
DRA	Matthew	14	24	But the boat in the midst of the sea was tossed with the waves : for the wind was contrary .
DRA	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night , he came to them walking upon the sea .
DRA	Matthew	14	26	And they seeing him walk upon the sea , were troubled , saying : It is an apparition . And they cried out for fear .
DRA	Matthew	14	27	And immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying : Be of good heart : it is I , fear ye not .
DRA	Matthew	14	28	And Peter making answer , said : Lord , if it be thou , bid me come to thee upon the waters .
DRA	Matthew	14	29	And he said : Come . And Peter going down out of the boat , walked upon the water to come to Jesus .
DRA	Matthew	14	30	But seeing the wind strong , he was afraid : and when he began to sink , he cried out , saying : Lord , save me .
DRA	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretching forth his hand took hold of him , and said to him : O thou of little faith , why didst thou doubt ?
DRA	Matthew	14	32	And when they were come up into the boat , the wind ceased .
DRA	Matthew	14	33	And they that were in the boat came and adored him , saying : Indeed thou art the Son of God .
DRA	Matthew	14	34	And having passed the water , they came into the country of Genesar .
DRA	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent into all that country , and brought to him all that were diseased .
DRA	Matthew	14	36	And they besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment . And as many as touched , were made whole . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	15	15	And Peter answering , said to him : Expound to us this parable .
DRA	Matthew	15	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	15	2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients ? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
DRA	Matthew	15	3	But he answering , said to them : Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition ? For God said :
DRA	Matthew	15	4	Honour thy father and mother : And : He that shall curse father or mother , let him die the death .
DRA	Matthew	15	5	But you say : Whosoever shall say to father or mother , The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me , shall profit thee .
DRA	Matthew	15	6	And he shall not honour his father or his mother : and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition .
DRA	Matthew	15	7	Hypocrites , well hath Isaias prophesied of you , saying :
DRA	Matthew	15	8	This people honoureth me with their lips : but their heart is far from me .
DRA	Matthew	15	9	And in vain do they worship me , teaching doctrines and commandments of men .
DRA	Matthew	15	10	And having called together the multitudes unto him , he said to them : Hear ye and understand .
DRA	Matthew	15	11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man : but what cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
DRA	Matthew	15	12	Then came his disciples , and said to him : Dost thou know that the Pharisees , when they heard this word , were scandalized ?
DRA	Matthew	15	13	But he answering them , said : Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
DRA	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone : they are blind , and leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both will fall into the pit .
DRA	Matthew	15	16	But he said : Are you also yet without understanding ?
DRA	Matthew	15	17	Do you not understand , that whatsoever entereth into the mouth , goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the privy ?
DRA	Matthew	15	18	But the things which proceed out of the mouth , come forth from the heart , and those things defile a man .
DRA	Matthew	15	19	For from the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false testimonies , blasphemies .
DRA	Matthew	15	20	These are the things that defile a man . But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man .
DRA	Matthew	15	21	And Jesus went from thence , and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
DRA	Matthew	15	22	And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts , crying out , said to him : Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou son of David : my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil .
DRA	Matthew	15	23	Who answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying : Send her away , for she crieth after us :
DRA	Matthew	15	24	And he answering , said : I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel .
DRA	Matthew	15	25	But she came and adored him , saying : Lord , help me .
DRA	Matthew	15	26	Who answering , said : It is not good to take the bread of the children , and to cast it to the dogs .
DRA	Matthew	15	27	But she said : Yea , Lord ; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters .
DRA	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answering , said to her : O woman , great is thy faith : be it done to thee as thou wilt : and her daughter was cured from that hour .
DRA	Matthew	15	29	And when Jesus had passed away from thence , he came nigh the sea of Galilee . And going up into a mountain , he sat there .
DRA	Matthew	15	30	And there came to him great multitudes , having with them the dumb , the blind , the lame , the maimed , and many others : and they cast them down at his feet , and he healed them :
DRA	Matthew	15	31	So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak , the lame walk , and the blind see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
DRA	Matthew	15	32	And Jesus called together his disciples , and said : I have compassion on the multitudes , because they continue with me now three days , and have not what to eat , and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
DRA	Matthew	15	33	And the disciples say unto him : Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert , as to fill so great a multitude ?
DRA	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus said to them : How many loaves have you ? But they said : Seven , and a few little fishes .
DRA	Matthew	15	35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground .
DRA	Matthew	15	36	And taking the seven loaves and the fishes , and giving thanks , he brake , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the people .
DRA	Matthew	15	37	And they did all eat , and had their fill . And they took up seven baskets full , of what remained of the fragments .
DRA	Matthew	15	38	And they that did eat , were four thousand men , beside children and women .

DRA	Matthew	16	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	16	2	But he answered and said to them : When it is evening , you say , It will be fair weather , for the sky is red .
DRA	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning : To day there will be a storm , for the sky is red and lowering . You know then how to discern the face of the sky : and can you not know the signs of the times ?
DRA	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign : and a sign shall not be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet . And he left them , and went away .
DRA	Matthew	16	5	And when his disciples were come over the water , they had forgotten to take bread .
DRA	Matthew	16	6	Who said to them : Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
DRA	Matthew	16	7	But they thought within themselves , saying : Because we have taken no bread .
DRA	Matthew	16	8	And Jesus knowing it , said : Why do you think within yourselves , O ye of little faith , for that you have no bread ?
DRA	Matthew	16	9	Do you not yet understand , neither do you remember the five loaves among five thousand men , and how many baskets you took up ?
DRA	Matthew	16	10	Nor the seven loaves among four thousand men , and how many baskets you took up ?
DRA	Matthew	16	11	Why do you not understand that it was not concerning the bread I said to you : Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ?
DRA	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that he said not that they should beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
DRA	Matthew	16	13	And Jesus came into the quarters of Caesarea Philippi : and he asked his disciples , saying : Whom do men say that the Son of man is ?
DRA	Matthew	16	14	But they said : Some John the Baptist , and other some Elias , and others Jeremias , or one of the prophets .
DRA	Matthew	16	15	Jesus saith to them : But whom do you say that I am ?
DRA	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answering , said to him : Blessed art thou , Simon Bar-Jona : because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee , but my Father who is in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	16	18	And I say to thee : That thou art Peter ; and upon this rock I will build my church , and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
DRA	Matthew	16	19	And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven . And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth , it shall be bound also in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth , it shall be loosed also in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	16	20	Then he commanded his disciples , that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ .
DRA	Matthew	16	21	From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples , that he must go to Jerusalem , and suffer many things from the ancients and scribes and chief priests , and be put to death , and the third day rise again .
DRA	Matthew	16	22	And Peter taking him , began to rebuke him , saying : Lord , be it far from thee , this shall not be unto thee .
DRA	Matthew	16	23	Who turning , said to Peter : Go behind me , Satan , thou art a scandal unto me : because thou savourest not the things that are of God , but the things that are of men .
DRA	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to his disciples : If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
DRA	Matthew	16	25	For he that will save his life , shall lose it : and he that shall lose his life for my sake , shall find it .
DRA	Matthew	16	26	For what doth it profit a man , if he gain the whole world , and suffer the loss of his own soul ? Or what exchange shall a man give for his soul ?
DRA	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels : and then will he render to every man according to his works .
DRA	Matthew	16	28	Amen I say to you , there are some of them that stand here , that shall not taste death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	17	2	And he was transfigured before them . And his face did shine as the sun : and his garments became white as snow .
DRA	Matthew	17	3	And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him .
DRA	Matthew	17	4	And Peter answering , said to Jesus : Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
DRA	Matthew	17	5	And as he was yet speaking , behold a bright cloud overshadowed them . And lo , a voice out of the cloud , saying : This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased : hear ye him .
DRA	Matthew	17	6	And the disciples hearing , fell upon their face , and were very much afraid .
DRA	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came and touched them : and said to them , Arise , and fear not .
DRA	Matthew	17	8	And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus .
DRA	Matthew	17	9	And as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying : Tell the vision to no man , till the Son of man be risen from the dead .
DRA	Matthew	17	10	And his disciples asked him , saying : Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first ?
DRA	Matthew	17	11	But he answering , said to them : Elias indeed shall come , and restore all things .
DRA	Matthew	17	12	But I say to you , that Elias is already come , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind . So also the Son of man shall suffer from them .
DRA	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood , that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist .
DRA	Matthew	17	14	And when he was come to the multitude , there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him , saying : Lord , have pity on my son , for he is a lunatic , and suffereth much : for he falleth often into the fire , and often into the water .
DRA	Matthew	17	15	And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
DRA	Matthew	17	16	Then Jesus answered and said : O unbelieving and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? How long shall I suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
DRA	Matthew	17	18	Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly , and said : Why could not we cast him out ?
DRA	Matthew	17	19	Jesus said to them : Because of your unbelief . For , amen I say to you , if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you shall say to this mountain , Remove from hence hither , and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible to you .
DRA	Matthew	17	20	But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting .
DRA	Matthew	17	21	And when they abode together in Galilee , Jesus said to them : The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
DRA	Matthew	17	22	And they shall kill him , and the third day he shall rise again . And they were troubled exceedingly .
DRA	Matthew	17	23	And when they were come to Capharnaum , they that received the didrachmas , came to Peter and said to him : Doth not your master pay the didrachmas ?
DRA	Matthew	17	24	He said : Yes . And when he was come into the house , Jesus prevented him , saying : What is thy opinion , Simon ? The kings of the earth , of whom do they receive tribute or custom ? of their own children , or of strangers ?
DRA	Matthew	17	25	And he said : Of strangers . Jesus said to him : Then the children are free .
DRA	Matthew	17	26	But that we may not scandalize them , go to the sea , and cast in a hook : and that fish which shall first come up , take : and when thou hast opened its mouth , thou shalt find a stater : take that , and give it to them for me and thee .

DRA	Matthew	18	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	18	2	And Jesus calling unto him a little child , set him in the midst of them ,
DRA	Matthew	18	3	And said : Amen I say to you , unless you be converted , and become as little children , you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	18	4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , he is the greater in the kingdom of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	18	5	And he that shall receive one such little child in my name , receiveth me .
DRA	Matthew	18	6	But he that shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck , and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea .
DRA	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world because of scandals . For it must needs be that scandals come : but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh .
DRA	Matthew	18	8	And if thy hand , or thy foot scandalize thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee . It is better for thee to go into life maimed or lame , than having two hands or two feet , to be cast into everlasting fire .
DRA	Matthew	18	9	And if thy eye scandalize thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee . It is better for thee having one eye to enter into life , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
DRA	Matthew	18	10	See that you despise not one of these little ones : for I say to you , that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	18	11	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
DRA	Matthew	18	12	What think you ? If a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them should go astray : doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains , and go to seek that which is gone astray ?
DRA	Matthew	18	13	And if it so be that he find it : Amen I say to you , he rejoiceth more for that , than for the ninety-nine that went not astray .
DRA	Matthew	18	14	Even so it is not the will of your Father , who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
DRA	Matthew	18	15	But if thy brother shall offend against thee , go , and rebuke him between thee and him alone . If he shall hear thee , thou shalt gain thy brother .
DRA	Matthew	18	16	And if he will not hear thee , take with thee one or two more : that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand .
DRA	Matthew	18	17	And if he will not hear them : tell the church . And if he will not hear the church , let him be to thee as the heathen and publican .
DRA	Matthew	18	19	Again I say to you , that if two of you shall consent upon earth , concerning any thing whatsoever they shall ask , it shall be done to them by my Father who is in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	18	20	For where there are two or three gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
DRA	Matthew	18	21	Then came Peter unto him and said : Lord , how often shall my brother offend against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ?
DRA	Matthew	18	22	Jesus saith to him : I say not to thee , till seven times ; but till seventy times seven times .
DRA	Matthew	18	23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a king , who would take an account of his servants .
DRA	Matthew	18	24	And when he had begun to take the account , one was brought to him , that owed him ten thousand talents .
DRA	Matthew	18	25	And as he had not wherewith to pay it , his lord commanded that he should be sold , and his wife and children and all that he had , and payment to be made .
DRA	Matthew	18	26	But that servant falling down , besought him , saying : Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
DRA	Matthew	18	27	And the lord of that servant being moved with pity , let him go and forgave him the debt .
DRA	Matthew	18	28	But when that servant was gone out , he found one of his fellow servants that owed him an hundred pence : and laying hold of him , throttled him , saying : Pay what thou owest .
DRA	Matthew	18	29	And his fellow servant falling down , besought him , saying : Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
DRA	Matthew	18	30	And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he paid the debt .
DRA	Matthew	18	31	Now his fellow servants seeing what was done , were very much grieved , and they came and told their lord all that was done .
DRA	Matthew	18	32	Then his lord called him ; and said to him : Thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all the debt , because thou besoughtest me :
DRA	Matthew	18	33	Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow servant , even as I had compassion on thee ?
DRA	Matthew	18	34	And his lord being angry , delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the debt .
DRA	Matthew	18	35	So also shall my heavenly Father do to you , if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	19	2	And great multitudes followed him : and he healed them there .
DRA	Matthew	19	3	And there came to him the Pharisees tempting him , and saying : Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
DRA	Matthew	19	4	Who answering , said to them : Have ye not read , that he who made man from the beginning , Made them male and female ? And he said :
DRA	Matthew	19	5	For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife , and they two shall be in one flesh .
DRA	Matthew	19	6	Therefore now they are not two , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let no man put asunder .
DRA	Matthew	19	7	They say to him : Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce , and to put away ?
DRA	Matthew	19	8	He saith to them : Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
DRA	Matthew	19	9	And I say to you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and he that shall marry her that is put away , committeth adultery .
DRA	Matthew	19	10	His disciples say unto him : If the case of a man with his wife be so , it is not expedient to marry .
DRA	Matthew	19	11	Who said to them : All men take not this word , but they to whom it is given .
DRA	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs , who were born so from their mother 's womb : and there are eunuchs , who were made so by men : and there are eunuchs , who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven . He that can take , let him take it .
DRA	Matthew	19	13	Then were little children presented to him , that he should impose hands upon them and pray . And the disciples rebuked them .
DRA	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said to them : Suffer the little children , and forbid them not to come to me : for the kingdom of heaven is for such .
DRA	Matthew	19	15	And when he had imposed hands upon them , he departed from thence .
DRA	Matthew	19	16	And behold one came and said to him : Good master , what good shall I do that I may have life everlasting ?
DRA	Matthew	19	17	Who said to him : Why asketh thou me concerning good ? One is good , God . But if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
DRA	Matthew	19	18	He said to him : Which ? And Jesus said : Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness .
DRA	Matthew	19	20	The young man saith to him : All these I have kept from my youth , what is yet wanting to me ?
DRA	Matthew	19	21	Jesus saith to him : If thou wilt be perfect , go sell what thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come follow me .

DRA	Matthew	19	23	Then Jesus said to his disciples : Amen , I say to you , that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	19	24	And again I say to you : It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven .

DRA	Matthew	20	10	But when the first also came , they thought that they should receive more : and they also received every man a penny .

DRA	Matthew	20	12	Saying : These last have worked but one hour , and thou hast made them equal to us , that have borne the burden of the day and the heats .
DRA	Matthew	20	13	But he answering said to one of them : Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst thou not agree with me for a penny ?
DRA	Matthew	20	14	Take what is thine , and go thy way : I will also give to this last even as to thee .
DRA	Matthew	20	15	Or , is it not lawful for me to do what I will ? is thy eye evil , because I am good ?

DRA	Matthew	21	5	Tell ye the daughter of Sion : Behold thy king cometh to thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke .

DRA	Matthew	21	16	And said to him : Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus said to them : Yea , have you never read : Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
DRA	Matthew	21	17	And leaving them , he went out of the city into Bethania , and remained there .

DRA	Matthew	21	26	If we shall say , from heaven , he will say to us : Why then did you not believe him ? But if we shall say , from men , we are afraid of the multitude : for all held John as a prophet .
DRA	Matthew	21	27	And answering Jesus , they said : We know not . He also said to them : Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
DRA	Matthew	21	28	But what think you ? A certain man had two sons ; and coming to the first , he said : Son , go work to day in my vineyard .

DRA	Matthew	21	39	And taking him , they cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him .

DRA	Matthew	22	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king , who made a marriage for his son .
DRA	Matthew	22	3	And he sent his servants , to call them that were invited to the marriage ; and they would not come .
DRA	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent other servants , saying : Tell them that were invited , Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my calves and fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come ye to the marriage .
DRA	Matthew	22	5	But they neglected , and went their own ways , one to his farm , and another to his merchandise .
DRA	Matthew	22	6	And the rest laid hands on his servants , and having treated them contumeliously , put them to death .
DRA	Matthew	22	7	But when the king had heard of it , he was angry , and sending his armies , he destroyed those murderers , and burnt their city .
DRA	Matthew	22	8	Then he saith to his servants : The marriage indeed is ready ; but they that were invited were not worthy .
DRA	Matthew	22	9	Go ye therefore into the highways ; and as many as you shall find , call to the marriage .
DRA	Matthew	22	10	And his servants going forth into the ways , gathered together all that they found , both bad and good : and the marriage was filled with guests .
DRA	Matthew	22	11	And the king went in to see the guests : and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment .
DRA	Matthew	22	12	And he saith to him : Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? But he was silent .
DRA	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the waiters : Bind his hands and feet , and cast him into the exterior darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
DRA	Matthew	22	14	For many are called , but few are chosen .
DRA	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees going , consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech .
DRA	Matthew	22	16	And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians , saying : Master , we know that thou art a true speaker , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou dost not regard the person of men .
DRA	Matthew	22	17	Tell us therefore what dost thou think , is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
DRA	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus knowing their wickedness , said : Why do you tempt me , ye hypocrites ?
DRA	Matthew	22	19	Shew me the coin of the tribute . And they offered him a penny .
DRA	Matthew	22	20	And Jesus saith to them : Whose image and inscription is this ?
DRA	Matthew	22	21	They say to him : Caesar 's . Then he saith to them : Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's ; and to God , the things that are God 's .
DRA	Matthew	22	23	That day there came to him the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and asked him ,
DRA	Matthew	22	24	Saying : Master , Moses said : If a man die having no son , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up issue to his brother .
DRA	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first having married a wife , died ; and not having issue , left his wife to his brother .
DRA	Matthew	22	26	In like manner the second , and the third , and so on to the seventh .
DRA	Matthew	22	27	And last of all the woman died also .
DRA	Matthew	22	28	At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be ? for they all had her .
DRA	Matthew	22	29	And Jesus answering , said to them : You err , not knowing the Scriptures , nor the power of God .
DRA	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married ; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	22	31	And concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you not read that which was spoken by God , saying to you :
DRA	Matthew	22	32	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? He is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
DRA	Matthew	22	33	And the multitudes hearing it , were in admiration at his doctrine .
DRA	Matthew	22	34	But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees , came together :
DRA	Matthew	22	35	And one of them , a doctor of the law , asking him , tempting him :
DRA	Matthew	22	36	Master , which is the greatest commandment in the law ?
DRA	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said to him : Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with thy whole mind .
DRA	Matthew	22	38	This is the greatest and the first commandment .
DRA	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like to this : Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
DRA	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets .
DRA	Matthew	22	41	And the Pharisees being gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
DRA	Matthew	22	42	Saying : What think you of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say to him : David 's .
DRA	Matthew	22	43	He saith to them : How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying :
DRA	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand , until I make thy enemies thy footstool ?
DRA	Matthew	22	45	If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ?
DRA	Matthew	22	46	And no man was able to answer him a word ; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	23	23	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; because you tithe mint , and anise , and cummin , and have left the weightier things of the law ; judgment , and mercy , and faith . These things you ought to have done , and not to leave those undone .
DRA	Matthew	23	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	23	2	Saying : The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses .
DRA	Matthew	23	3	All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you , observe and do : but according to their works do ye not ; for they say , and do not .
DRA	Matthew	23	4	For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but with a finger of their own they will not move them .
DRA	Matthew	23	5	And all their works they do for to be seen of men . For they make their phylacteries broad , and enlarge their fringes .
DRA	Matthew	23	6	And they love the first places at feasts , and the first chairs in the synagogues ,
DRA	Matthew	23	7	And salutations in the market place , and to be called by men , Rabbi .
DRA	Matthew	23	8	But be not you called Rabbi . For one is your master ; and all you are brethren .
DRA	Matthew	23	9	And call none your father upon earth ; for one is your father , who is in heaven .
DRA	Matthew	23	10	Neither be ye called masters ; for one is your master , Christ .
DRA	Matthew	23	11	He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant .
DRA	Matthew	23	12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled : and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
DRA	Matthew	23	13	But woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men , for you yourselves do not enter in ; and those that are going in , you suffer not to enter .
DRA	Matthew	23	14	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites : because you devour the houses of widows , praying long prayers . For this you shall receive the greater judgment .
DRA	Matthew	23	15	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; because you go round about the sea and the land to make one proselyte ; and when he is made , you make him the child of hell twofold more than yourselves .
DRA	Matthew	23	16	Woe to you blind guides , that say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but he that shall swear by the gold of the temple , is a debtor .
DRA	Matthew	23	17	Ye foolish and blind ; for whether is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
DRA	Matthew	23	18	And whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it , is a debtor .
DRA	Matthew	23	19	Ye blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
DRA	Matthew	23	20	He therefore that sweareth by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things that are upon it :
DRA	Matthew	23	21	And whosoever shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth in it :
DRA	Matthew	23	22	And he that sweareth by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
DRA	Matthew	23	24	Blind guides , who strain out a gnat , and swallow a camel .
DRA	Matthew	23	25	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; because you make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish , but within you are full of rapine and uncleanness .
DRA	Matthew	23	26	Thou blind Pharisee , first make clean the inside of the cup and of the dish , that the outside may become clean .
DRA	Matthew	23	27	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; because you are like to whited sepulchres , which outwardly appear to men beautiful , but within are full of dead men 's bones , and of all filthiness .
DRA	Matthew	23	28	So you also outwardly indeed appear to men just ; but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
DRA	Matthew	23	29	Woe to you scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ; that build the sepulchres of the prophets , and adorn the monuments of the just ,
DRA	Matthew	23	30	And say : If we had been in the days of our Fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
DRA	Matthew	23	31	Wherefore you are witnesses against yourselves , that you are the sons of them that killed the prophets .
DRA	Matthew	23	32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
DRA	Matthew	23	33	You serpents , generation of vipers , how will you flee from the judgment of hell ?
DRA	Matthew	23	34	Therefore behold I send to you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them you will put to death and crucify , and some you will scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city :
DRA	Matthew	23	35	That upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth , from the blood of Abel the just , even unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias , whom you killed between the temple and the altar .
DRA	Matthew	23	36	Amen I say to you , all these things shall come upon this generation .
DRA	Matthew	23	37	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered together thy children , as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings , and thou wouldest not ?
DRA	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house shall be left to you , desolate .
DRA	Matthew	23	39	For I say to you , you shall not see me henceforth till you say : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	24	24	For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders , insomuch as to deceive ( if possible ) even the elect .
DRA	Matthew	24	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	24	2	And he answering , said to them : Do you see all these things ? Amen I say to you there shall not be left here a stone upon a stone that shall not be destroyed .
DRA	Matthew	24	3	And when he was sitting on mount Olivet , the disciples came to him privately , saying : Tell us when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the consummation of the world ?
DRA	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answering , said to them : Take heed that no man seduce you :
DRA	Matthew	24	5	For many will come in my name saying , I am Christ : and they will seduce many .
DRA	Matthew	24	6	And you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars . See that ye be not troubled . For these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
DRA	Matthew	24	7	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be pestilences , and famines , and earthquakes in places :
DRA	Matthew	24	8	Now all these are the beginnings of sorrows .
DRA	Matthew	24	9	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall put you to death : and you shall be hated by all nations for my name 's sake .
DRA	Matthew	24	10	And then shall many be scandalized : and shall betray one another : and shall hate one another .
DRA	Matthew	24	11	And many false prophets shall rise , and shall seduce many .
DRA	Matthew	24	12	And because iniquity hath abounded , the charity of many shall grow cold .
DRA	Matthew	24	13	But he that shall persevere to the end , he shall be saved .
DRA	Matthew	24	14	And this gospel of the kingdom , shall be preached in the whole world , for a testimony to all nations , and then shall the consummation come .
DRA	Matthew	24	15	When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place : he that readeth let him understand .
DRA	Matthew	24	16	Then they that are in Judea , let them flee to the mountains :
DRA	Matthew	24	17	And he that is on the housetop , let him not come down to take any thing out of his house :
DRA	Matthew	24	18	And he that is in the field , let him not go back to take his coat .
DRA	Matthew	24	19	And woe to them that are with child , and that give suck in those days .
DRA	Matthew	24	20	But pray that your flight be not in the winter , or on the sabbath .
DRA	Matthew	24	21	For there shall be then great tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now , neither shall be .
DRA	Matthew	24	22	And unless those days had been shortened , no flesh should be saved : but for the sake of the elect those days shall be shortened .
DRA	Matthew	24	23	Then if any man shall say to you : Lo here is Christ , or there , do not believe him .
DRA	Matthew	24	25	Behold I have told it to you , beforehand .
DRA	Matthew	24	26	If therefore they shall say to you : Behold he is in the desert , go ye not out : Behold he is in the closets , believe it not .
DRA	Matthew	24	27	For as lightning cometh out of the east , and appeareth even into the west : so shall the coming of the Son of man be .
DRA	Matthew	24	28	Wheresoever the body shall be , there shall the eagles also be gathered together .
DRA	Matthew	24	29	And immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of heaven shall be moved :

DRA	Matthew	24	32	And from the fig tree learn a parable : When the branch thereof is now tender , and the leaves come forth , you know that summer is nigh .
DRA	Matthew	24	33	So you also , when you shall see all these things , know ye that it is nigh , even at the doors .
DRA	Matthew	24	34	Amen I say to you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
DRA	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth shall pass , but my words shall not pass .
DRA	Matthew	24	36	But of that day and hour no one knoweth , not the angels of heaven , but the Father alone .
DRA	Matthew	24	37	And as in the days of Noe , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
DRA	Matthew	24	38	For as in the days before the flood , they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , even till that day in which Noe entered into the ark ,
DRA	Matthew	24	39	And they knew not till the flood came , and took them all away ; so also shall the coming of the Son of man be .

DRA	Matthew	24	44	Wherefore be you also ready , because at what hour you know not the Son of man will come .
DRA	Matthew	24	45	Who , thinkest thou , is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath appointed over his family , to give them meat in season .
DRA	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that servant , whom when his lord shall come he shall find so doing .
DRA	Matthew	24	47	Amen I say to you , he shall place him over all his goods .
DRA	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil servant shall say in his heart : My lord is long a coming :
DRA	Matthew	24	49	And shall begin to strike his fellow servants , and shall eat and drink with drunkards :
DRA	Matthew	24	50	The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he hopeth not , and at an hour that he knoweth not :
DRA	Matthew	24	51	And shall separate him , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites . There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	25	25	And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth : behold here thou hast that which is thine .
DRA	Matthew	25	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	25	2	And five of them were foolish , and five wise .
DRA	Matthew	25	3	But the five foolish , having taken their lamps , did not take oil with them :
DRA	Matthew	25	4	But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps .
DRA	Matthew	25	5	And the bridegroom tarrying , they all slumbered and slept .
DRA	Matthew	25	6	And at midnight there was a cry made : Behold the bridegroom cometh , go ye forth to meet him .
DRA	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps .
DRA	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said to the wise : Give us of your oil , for our lamps are gone out .
DRA	Matthew	25	9	The wise answered , saying : Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you , go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
DRA	Matthew	25	10	Now whilst they went to buy , the bridegroom came : and they that were ready , went in with him to the marriage , and the door was shut .
DRA	Matthew	25	11	But at last come also the other virgins , saying : Lord , Lord , open to us .
DRA	Matthew	25	12	But he answering said : Amen I say to you , I know you not .
DRA	Matthew	25	13	Watch ye therefore , because you know not the day nor the hour .
DRA	Matthew	25	14	For even as a man going into a far country , called his servants , and delivered to them his goods ;
DRA	Matthew	25	15	And to one he gave five talents , and to another two , and to another one , to every one according to his proper ability : and immediately he took his journey .
DRA	Matthew	25	16	And he that had received the five talents , went his way , and traded with the same , and gained other five .
DRA	Matthew	25	17	And in like manner he that had received the two , gained other two .
DRA	Matthew	25	18	But he that had received the one , going his way digged into the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
DRA	Matthew	25	19	But after a long time the lord of those servants came , and reckoned with them .
DRA	Matthew	25	20	And he that had received the five talents coming , brought other five talents , saying : Lord , thou didst deliver to me five talents , behold I have gained other five over and above .
DRA	Matthew	25	21	His lord said to him : Well done , good and faithful servant , because thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will place thee over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
DRA	Matthew	25	22	And he also that had received the two talents came and said : Lord , thou deliveredst two talents to me : behold I have gained other two .
DRA	Matthew	25	23	His lord said to him : Well done , good and faithful servant : because thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will place thee over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
DRA	Matthew	25	24	But he that had received the one talent , came and said : Lord , I know that thou art a hard man ; thou reapest where thou hast not sown , and gatherest where thou hast not strewed .
DRA	Matthew	25	26	And his lord answering , said to him : Wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sow not , and gather where I have not strewed :
DRA	Matthew	25	27	Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers , and at my coming I should have received my own with usury .
DRA	Matthew	25	28	Take ye away therefore the talent from him , and give it to him that hath ten talents .
DRA	Matthew	25	29	For to every one that hath shall be given , and he shall abound : but from him that hath not , that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away .
DRA	Matthew	25	30	And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness . There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
DRA	Matthew	25	31	And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty .
DRA	Matthew	25	32	And all nations shall be gathered together before him , and he shall separate them one from another , as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats :
DRA	Matthew	25	33	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on his left .
DRA	Matthew	25	34	Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand : Come , ye blessed of my Father , possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
DRA	Matthew	25	35	For I was hungry , and you gave me to eat ; I was thirsty , and you gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and you took me in :
DRA	Matthew	25	36	Naked , and you covered me : sick , and you visited me : I was in prison , and you came to me .
DRA	Matthew	25	37	Then shall the just answer him , saying : Lord , when did we see thee hungry , and fed thee ; thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
DRA	Matthew	25	38	And when did we see thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and covered thee ?
DRA	Matthew	25	39	Or when did we see thee sick or in prison , and came to thee ?
DRA	Matthew	25	40	And the king answering , shall say to them : Amen I say to you , as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren , you did it to me .
DRA	Matthew	25	41	Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand : Depart from me , you cursed , into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels .
DRA	Matthew	25	42	For I was hungry , and you gave me not to eat : I was thirsty , and you gave me not to drink .
DRA	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , and you took me not in : naked , and you covered me not : sick and in prison , and you did not visit me .
DRA	Matthew	25	44	Then they also shall answer him , saying : Lord , when did we see thee hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister to thee ?
DRA	Matthew	25	45	Then he shall answer them , saying : Amen I say to you , as long as you did it not to one of these least , neither did you do it to me .
DRA	Matthew	25	46	And these shall go into everlasting punishment : but the just , into life everlasting . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	26	26	And whilst they were at supper , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and broke : and gave to his disciples , and said : Take ye , and eat . This is my body .
DRA	Matthew	26	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	26	2	You know that after two days shall be the pasch , and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified :
DRA	Matthew	26	3	Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest , who was called Caiphas :
DRA	Matthew	26	4	And they consulted together , that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus , and put him to death .
DRA	Matthew	26	5	But they said : Not on the festival day , lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people .
DRA	Matthew	26	6	And when Jesus was in Bethania , in the house of Simon the leper ,
DRA	Matthew	26	7	There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment , and poured it on his head as he was at table .
DRA	Matthew	26	8	And the disciples seeing it , had indignation , saying : To what purpose is this waste ?
DRA	Matthew	26	9	For this might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
DRA	Matthew	26	10	And Jesus knowing it , said to them : Why do you trouble this woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
DRA	Matthew	26	11	For the poor you have always with you : but me you have not always .
DRA	Matthew	26	12	For she in pouring this ointment upon my body , hath done it for my burial .
DRA	Matthew	26	13	Amen I say to you , wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , that also which she hath done , shall be told for a memory of her .
DRA	Matthew	26	14	Then went one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , to the chief priests ,
DRA	Matthew	26	15	And said to them : What will you give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver .
DRA	Matthew	26	16	And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him .
DRA	Matthew	26	17	And on the first day of the Azymes , the disciples came to Jesus , saying : Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch ?
DRA	Matthew	26	18	But Jesus said : Go ye into the city to a certain man , and say to him : the master saith , My time is near at hand , with thee I make the pasch with my disciples .
DRA	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them , and they prepared the pasch .
DRA	Matthew	26	20	But when it was evening , he sat down with his twelve disciples .
DRA	Matthew	26	21	And whilst they were eating , he said : Amen I say to you , that one of you is about to betray me .
DRA	Matthew	26	22	And they being very much troubled , began every one to say : Is it I , Lord ?
DRA	Matthew	26	23	But he answering , said : He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , he shall betray me .
DRA	Matthew	26	24	The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed : it were better for him , if that man had not been born .
DRA	Matthew	26	25	And Judas that betrayed him , answering , said : Is it I , Rabbi ? He saith to him : Thou hast said it .
DRA	Matthew	26	27	And taking the chalice , he gave thanks , and gave to them , saying : Drink ye all of this .
DRA	Matthew	26	28	For this is my blood of the new testament , which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins .
DRA	Matthew	26	29	And I say to you , I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father .
DRA	Matthew	26	30	And a hymn being said , they went out unto mount Olivet .
DRA	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus said to them : All you shall be scandalized in me this night . For it is written : I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed .
DRA	Matthew	26	32	But after I shall be risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
DRA	Matthew	26	33	And Peter answering , said to him : Although all shall be scandalized in thee , I will never be scandalized .
DRA	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him : Amen I say to thee , that in this night before the cock crow , thou wilt deny me thrice .
DRA	Matthew	26	35	Peter saith to him : Yea , though I should die with thee , I will not deny thee . And in like manner said all the disciples .
DRA	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani ; and he said to his disciples : Sit you here , till I go yonder and pray .
DRA	Matthew	26	37	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad .
DRA	Matthew	26	38	Then he saith to them : My soul is sorrowful even unto death : stay you here , and watch with me .
DRA	Matthew	26	39	And going a little further , he fell upon his face , praying , and saying : My Father , if it be possible , let this chalice pass from me . Nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt .
DRA	Matthew	26	40	And he cometh to his disciples , and findeth them asleep , and he saith to Peter : What ? Could you not watch one hour with me ?
DRA	Matthew	26	41	Watch ye , and pray that ye enter not into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh weak .
DRA	Matthew	26	42	Again the second time , he went and prayed , saying : My Father , if this chalice may not pass away , but I must drink it , thy will be done .
DRA	Matthew	26	43	And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping : for their eyes were heavy .
DRA	Matthew	26	44	And leaving them , he went again : and he prayed the third time , saying the selfsame word .
DRA	Matthew	26	45	Then he cometh to his disciples , and saith to them : Sleep ye now and take your rest ; behold the hour is at hand , and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
DRA	Matthew	26	46	Rise , let us go : behold he is at hand that will betray me .
DRA	Matthew	26	47	As he yet spoke , behold Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs , sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people .
DRA	Matthew	26	48	And he that betrayed him , gave them a sign , saying : Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he , hold him fast .
DRA	Matthew	26	49	And forthwith coming to Jesus , he said : Hail , Rabbi . And he kissed him .
DRA	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said to him : Friend , whereto art thou come ? Then they came up , and laid hands on Jesus , and held him .
DRA	Matthew	26	51	And behold one of them that were with Jesus , stretching forth his hand , drew out his sword : and striking the servant of the high priest , cut off his ear .
DRA	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus saith to him : Put up again thy sword into its place : for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
DRA	Matthew	26	53	Thinkest thou that I can not ask my Father , and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels ?
DRA	Matthew	26	54	How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that so it must be done ?
DRA	Matthew	26	55	In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes : You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me . I sat daily with you , teaching in the temple , and you laid not hands on me .
DRA	Matthew	26	56	Now all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then the disciples all leaving him , fled .
DRA	Matthew	26	57	But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest , where the scribes and the ancients were assembled .
DRA	Matthew	26	58	And Peter followed him afar off , even to the court of the high priest . And going in , he sat with the servants , that he might see the end .
DRA	Matthew	26	59	And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus , that they might put him to death :
DRA	Matthew	26	60	And they found not , whereas many false witnesses had come in . And last of all there came two false witnesses :
DRA	Matthew	26	61	And they said : This man said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and after three days to rebuild it .
DRA	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest rising up , said to him : Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee ?
DRA	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest said to him : I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God .
DRA	Matthew	26	64	Jesus saith to him : Thou hast said it . Nevertheless I say to you , hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
DRA	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priests rent his garments , saying : He hath blasphemed ; what further need have we of witnesses ? Behold , now you have heard the blasphemy :
DRA	Matthew	26	66	What think you ? But they answering , said : He is guilty of death .
DRA	Matthew	26	67	Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him : and others struck his face with the palms of their hands ,
DRA	Matthew	26	68	Saying : Prophesy unto us , O Christ , who is he that struck thee ?
DRA	Matthew	26	69	But Peter sat without in the court : and there came to him a servant maid , saying : Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean .
DRA	Matthew	26	70	But he denied before them all , saying : I know not what thou sayest .
DRA	Matthew	26	71	And as he went out of the gate , another maid saw him , and she saith to them that were there : This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth .
DRA	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath , I know not the man .
DRA	Matthew	26	73	And after a little while they came that stood by , and said to Peter : Surely thou also art one of them ; for even thy speech doth discover thee .
DRA	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man . And immediately the cock crew .
DRA	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said : Before the cock crow , thou wilt deny me thrice . And going forth , he wept bitterly . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall , gathered together unto him the whole band ;
DRA	Matthew	27	1899	American Edition
DRA	Matthew	27	2	And they brought him bound , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
DRA	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas , who betrayed him , seeing that he was condemned , repenting himself , brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients ,
DRA	Matthew	27	4	Saying : I have sinned in betraying innocent blood . But they said : What is that to us ? look thou to it .
DRA	Matthew	27	5	And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple , he departed : and went and hanged himself with an halter .
DRA	Matthew	27	6	But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver , said : It is not lawful to put them into the corbona , because it is the price of blood .
DRA	Matthew	27	7	And after they had consulted together , they bought with them the potter 's field , to be a burying place for strangers .
DRA	Matthew	27	8	For this cause the field was called Haceldama , that is , The field of blood , even to this day .
DRA	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet , saying : And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was prized , whom they prized of the children of Israel .
DRA	Matthew	27	10	And they gave them unto the potter 's field , as the Lord appointed to me .
DRA	Matthew	27	11	And Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , saying : Art thou the king of the Jews ? Jesus saith to him : Thou sayest it .
DRA	Matthew	27	12	And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients , he answered nothing .
DRA	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate saith to him : Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee ?
DRA	Matthew	27	14	And he answered him to never a word ; so that the governor wondered exceedingly .
DRA	Matthew	27	15	Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner , whom they would .
DRA	Matthew	27	16	And he had then a notorious prisoner , that was called Barabbas .
DRA	Matthew	27	17	They therefore being gathered together , Pilate said : Whom will you that I release to you , Barabbas , or Jesus that is called Christ ?
DRA	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
DRA	Matthew	27	19	And as he was sitting in the place of judgment , his wife sent to him , saying : Have thou nothing to do with that just man ; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
DRA	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people , that they should ask for Barabbas , and take Jesus away .
DRA	Matthew	27	21	And the governor answering , said to them : Whether will you of the two to be released unto you ? But they said , Barabbas .
DRA	Matthew	27	22	Pilate saith to them : What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ ? They say all : Let him be crucified .
DRA	Matthew	27	23	The governor said to them : Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying : Let him be crucified .
DRA	Matthew	27	24	And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing , but that rather a tumult was made ; taking water washed his hands before the people , saying : I am innocent of the blood of this just man ; look you to it .
DRA	Matthew	27	25	And the whole people answering , said : His blood be upon us and our children .
DRA	Matthew	27	26	Then he released to them Barabbas , and having scourged Jesus , delivered him unto them to be crucified .
DRA	Matthew	27	28	And stripping him , they put a scarlet cloak about him .
DRA	Matthew	27	29	And platting a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand . And bowing the knee before him , they mocked him , saying : Hail , king of the Jews .
DRA	Matthew	27	30	And spitting upon him , they took the reed , and struck his head .
DRA	Matthew	27	31	And after they had mocked him , they took off the cloak from him , and put on him his own garments , and led him away to crucify him .
DRA	Matthew	27	32	And going out , they found a man of Cyrene , named Simon : him they forced to take up his cross .
DRA	Matthew	27	33	And they came to the place that is called Golgotha , which is the place of Calvary .
DRA	Matthew	27	34	And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall . And when he had tasted , he would not drink .
DRA	Matthew	27	35	And after they had crucified him , they divided his garments , casting lots ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying : They divided my garments among them ; and upon my vesture they cast lots .
DRA	Matthew	27	36	And they sat and watched him .
DRA	Matthew	27	37	And they put over his head his cause written : THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
DRA	Matthew	27	38	Then were crucified with him two thieves : one on the right hand , and one on the left .
DRA	Matthew	27	39	And they that passed by , blasphemed him , wagging their heads ,
DRA	Matthew	27	40	And saying : Vah , thou that destroyest the temple of God , and in three days dost rebuild it : save thy own self : if thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
DRA	Matthew	27	41	In like manner also the chief priests , with the scribes and ancients , mocking , said :
DRA	Matthew	27	42	He saved others ; himself he can not save . If he be the king of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
DRA	Matthew	27	43	He trusted in God ; let him now deliver him if he will have him ; for he said : I am the Son of God .
DRA	Matthew	27	44	And the selfsame thing the thieves also , that were crucified with him , reproached him with .
DRA	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth , until the ninth hour .
DRA	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying : Eli , Eli , lamma sabacthani ? that is , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
DRA	Matthew	27	47	And some that stood there and heard , said : This man calleth Elias .
DRA	Matthew	27	48	And immediately one of them running took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar ; and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
DRA	Matthew	27	49	And the others said : Let be , let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him .
DRA	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus again crying with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
DRA	Matthew	27	51	And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom , and the earth quaked , and the rocks were rent .
DRA	Matthew	27	52	And the graves were opened : and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose ,
DRA	Matthew	27	53	And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection , came into the holy city , and appeared to many .
DRA	Matthew	27	54	Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus , having seen the earthquake , and the things that were done , were sore afraid , saying : Indeed this was the Son of God .
DRA	Matthew	27	55	And there were there many women afar off , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him :
DRA	Matthew	27	56	Among whom was Mary Magdalen , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
DRA	Matthew	27	57	And when it was evening , there came a certain rich man of Arimathea , named Joseph , who also himself was a disciple of Jesus .
DRA	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate , and asked the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered .
DRA	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph taking the body , wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth .
DRA	Matthew	27	60	And laid it in his own new monument , which he had hewed out in a rock . And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument , and went his way .
DRA	Matthew	27	61	And there was there Mary Magdalen , and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre .
DRA	Matthew	27	62	And the next day , which followed the day of preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate ,
DRA	Matthew	27	63	Saying : Sir , we have remembered , that that seducer said , while he was yet alive : After three days I will rise again .
DRA	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day : lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away , and say to the people : He is risen from the dead ; and the last error shall be worse than the first .
DRA	Matthew	27	65	Pilate saith to them : You have a guard ; go , guard it as you know .
DRA	Matthew	27	66	And they departing , made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting guards . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Matthew	28	2	And behold there was a great earthquake . For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and coming , rolled back the stone , and sat upon it .
DRA	Matthew	28	3	And his countenance was as lightning , and his raiment as snow .
DRA	Matthew	28	4	And for fear of him , the guards were struck with terror , and became as dead men .
DRA	Matthew	28	5	And the angel answering , said to the women : Fear not you ; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified .
DRA	Matthew	28	6	He is not here , for he is risen , as he said . Come , and see the place where the Lord was laid .
DRA	Matthew	28	7	And going quickly , tell ye his disciples that he is risen : and behold he will go before you into Galilee ; there you shall see him . Lo , I have foretold it to you .
DRA	Matthew	28	8	And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy , running to tell his disciples .
DRA	Matthew	28	9	And behold Jesus met them , saying : All hail . But they came up and took hold of his feet , and adored him .
DRA	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them : Fear not . Go , tell my brethren that they go into Galilee , there they shall see me .
DRA	Matthew	28	11	Who when they were departed , behold some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all things that had been done .
DRA	Matthew	28	12	And they being assembled together with the ancients , taking counsel , gave a great sum of money to the soldiers ,
DRA	Matthew	28	13	Saying : Say you , His disciples came by night , and stole him away when we were asleep .
DRA	Matthew	28	14	And if the governor shall hear this , we will persuade him , and secure you .
DRA	Matthew	28	15	So they taking the money , did as they were taught : and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day .
DRA	Matthew	28	16	And the eleven disciples went into Galilee , unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
DRA	Matthew	28	17	And seeing him they adored : but some doubted .
DRA	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus coming , spoke to them , saying : All power is given to me in heaven and in earth .

DRA	Mark	5	2	And as he went out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the monuments a man with an unclean spirit ,
DRA	Mark	5	3	Who had his dwelling in the tombs , and no man now could bind him , not even with chains .

DRA	Mark	5	7	And crying with a loud voice , he said : What have I to do with thee , Jesus the Son of the most high God ? I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not .
DRA	Mark	5	8	For he said unto him : Go out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
DRA	Mark	5	9	And he asked him : What is thy name ? And he saith to him : My name is Legion , for we are many .

DRA	Mark	5	11	And there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine , feeding .
DRA	Mark	5	12	And the spirits besought him , saying : Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
DRA	Mark	5	13	And Jesus immediately gave them leave . And the unclean spirits going out , entered into the swine : and the herd with great violence was carried headlong into the sea , being about two thousand , and were stifled in the sea .
DRA	Mark	5	14	And they that fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the fields . And they went out to see what was done :
DRA	Mark	5	15	And they came to Jesus , and they see him that was troubled with the devil , sitting , clothed , and well in his wits , and they were afraid .
DRA	Mark	5	16	And they that had seen it , told them , in what manner he had been dealt with who had the devil ; and concerning the swine .
DRA	Mark	5	17	And they began to pray him that he would depart from their coasts .
DRA	Mark	5	18	And when he went up into the ship , he that had been troubled with the devil , began to beseech him that he might be with him .
DRA	Mark	5	19	And he admitted him not , but saith to him : Go into thy house to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had mercy on thee .

DRA	Mark	5	23	And he besought him much , saying : My daughter is at the point of death , come , lay thy hand upon her , that she may be safe , and may live .
DRA	Mark	5	24	And he went with him , and a great multitude followed him , and they thronged him .
DRA	Mark	5	25	And a woman who was under an issue of blood twelve years ,
DRA	Mark	5	26	And had suffered many things from many physicians ; and had spent all that she had , and was nothing the better , but rather worse ,
DRA	Mark	5	27	When she had heard of Jesus , came in the crowd behind him , and touched his garment .
DRA	Mark	5	28	For she said : If I shall touch but his garment , I shall be whole .
DRA	Mark	5	29	And forthwith the fountain of her blood was dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of the evil .
DRA	Mark	5	30	And immediately Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had proceeded from him , turning to the multitude , said : Who hath touched my garments ?
DRA	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said to him : Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou who hath touched me ?
DRA	Mark	5	32	And he looked about to see her who had done this .
DRA	Mark	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .

DRA	Mark	5	40	And they laughed him to scorn . But he having put them all out , taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
DRA	Mark	5	41	And taking the damsel by the hand , he saith to her : Talitha cumi , which is , being interpreted : Damsel ( I say to thee ) arise .

DRA	Mark	6	16	Which Herod hearing , said : John whom I beheaded , he is risen again from the dead .
DRA	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and apprehended John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother , because he had married her .
DRA	Mark	6	18	For John said to Herod : It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife .
DRA	Mark	6	19	Now Herodias laid snares for him : and was desirous to put him to death , and could not .
DRA	Mark	6	20	For Herod feared John , knowing him to be a just and holy man : and kept him , and when he heard him , did many things : and he heard him willingly .
DRA	Mark	6	21	And when a convenient day was come , Herod made a supper for his birthday , for the princes , and tribunes , and chief men of Galilee .
DRA	Mark	6	22	And when the daughter of the same Herodias had come in , and had danced , and pleased Herod , and them that were at table with him , the king said to the damsel : Ask of me what thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
DRA	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her : Whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee , though it be the half of my kingdom .
DRA	Mark	6	24	Who when she was gone out , said to her mother , What shall I ask ? But she said : The head of John the Baptist .
DRA	Mark	6	25	And when she was come in immediately with haste to the king , she asked , saying : I will that forthwith thou give me in a dish , the head of John the Baptist .
DRA	Mark	6	26	And the king was struck sad . Yet because of his oath , and because of them that were with him at table , he would not displease her :
DRA	Mark	6	27	But sending an executioner , he commanded that his head should be brought in a dish .

DRA	Mark	6	33	And they saw them going away , and many knew : and they ran flocking thither on foot from all the cities , and were there before them .
DRA	Mark	6	34	And Jesus going out saw a great multitude : and he had compassion on them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
DRA	Mark	6	35	And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came to him , saying : This is a desert place , and the hour is now past :
DRA	Mark	6	36	Send them away , that going into the next villages and towns , they may buy themselves meat to eat .
DRA	Mark	6	37	And he answering said to them : Give you them to eat . And they said to him : Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence , and we will give them to eat .
DRA	Mark	6	38	And he saith to them : How many loaves have you ? go and see . And when they knew , they say : Five , and two fishes .
DRA	Mark	6	39	And he commanded them that they should make them all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
DRA	Mark	6	40	And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds and by fifties .
DRA	Mark	6	41	And when he had taken the five loaves , and the two fishes : looking up to heaven , he blessed , and broke the loaves , and gave to his disciples to set before them : and the two fishes he divided among them all .
DRA	Mark	6	42	And they all did eat , and had their fill .
DRA	Mark	6	43	And they took up the leavings , twelve full baskets of fragments , and of the fishes .
DRA	Mark	6	44	And they that did eat , were five thousand men .
DRA	Mark	6	45	And immediately he obliged his disciples to go up into the ship , that they might go before him over the water to Bethsaida , whilst he dismissed the people .
DRA	Mark	6	46	And when he had dismissed them , he went up to the mountain to pray .
DRA	Mark	6	47	And when it was late , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and himself alone on the land .
DRA	Mark	6	48	And seeing them labouring in rowing , ( for the wind was against them , ) and about the fourth watch of the night , he cometh to them walking upon the sea , and he would have passed by them .
DRA	Mark	6	49	But they seeing him walking upon the sea , thought it was an apparition , and they cried out .
DRA	Mark	6	50	For they all saw him , and were troubled . And immediately he spoke with them , and said to them : Have a good heart , it is I , fear ye not .
DRA	Mark	6	51	And he went up to them into the ship , and the wind ceased : and they were far more astonished within themselves :
DRA	Mark	6	52	For they understood not concerning the loaves ; for their heart was blinded .
DRA	Mark	6	53	And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Genezareth , and set to the shore .
DRA	Mark	6	54	And when they were gone out of the ship , immediately they knew him :
DRA	Mark	6	55	And running through that whole country , they began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
DRA	Mark	6	56	And whithersoever he entered , into towns or into villages or cities , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Mark	7	7	And in vain do they worship me , teaching doctrines and precepts of men .
DRA	Mark	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Mark	7	2	And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common , that is , with unwashed hands , they found fault .
DRA	Mark	7	3	For the Pharisees , and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands , holding the tradition of the ancients :
DRA	Mark	7	4	And when they come from the market , unless they be washed , they eat not : and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe , the washings of cups and of pots , and of brazen vessels , and of beds .
DRA	Mark	7	5	And the Pharisees and scribes asked him : Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients , but they eat bread with common hands ?
DRA	Mark	7	6	But he answering , said to them : Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written : This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
DRA	Mark	7	8	For leaving the commandment of God , you hold the tradition of men , the washing of pots and of cups : and many other things you do like to these .
DRA	Mark	7	9	And he said to them : Well do you make void the commandment of God , that you may keep your own tradition .
DRA	Mark	7	10	For Moses said : Honour thy father and thy mother ; and He that shall curse father or mother , dying let him die .
DRA	Mark	7	11	But you say : If a man shall say to his father or mother , Corban , ( which is a gift , ) whatsoever is from me , shall profit thee .
DRA	Mark	7	12	And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother ,
DRA	Mark	7	13	Making void the word of God by your own tradition , which you have given forth . And many other such like things you do .
DRA	Mark	7	14	And calling again the multitude unto him , he said to them : Hear ye me all , and understand .
DRA	Mark	7	15	There is nothing from without a man that entering into him , can defile him . But the things which come from a man , those are they that defile a man .
DRA	Mark	7	16	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
DRA	Mark	7	17	And when he was come into the house from the multitude , his disciples asked him the parable .
DRA	Mark	7	18	And he saith to them : So are you also without knowledge ? understand you not that every thing from without , entering into a man can not defile him :
DRA	Mark	7	19	Because it entereth not into his heart , but goeth into the belly , and goeth out into the privy , purging all meats ?
DRA	Mark	7	20	But he said that the things which come out from a man , they defile a man .
DRA	Mark	7	21	For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
DRA	Mark	7	22	Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness .
DRA	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from within , and defile a man .
DRA	Mark	7	24	And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon : and entering into a house , he would that no man should know it , and he could not be hid .
DRA	Mark	7	25	For a woman as soon as she heard of him , whose daughter had an unclean spirit , came in and fell down at his feet .
DRA	Mark	7	26	For the woman was a Gentile , a Syrophenician born . And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
DRA	Mark	7	27	Who said to her : Suffer first the children to be filled : for it is not good to take the bread of the children , and cast it to the dogs .
DRA	Mark	7	28	But she answered and said to him : Yea , Lord ; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children .
DRA	Mark	7	29	And he said to her : For this saying go thy way , the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
DRA	Mark	7	30	And when she was come into her house , she found the girl lying upon the bed , and that the devil was gone out .
DRA	Mark	7	31	And again going out of the coasts of Tyre , he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
DRA	Mark	7	32	And they bring to him one deaf and dumb ; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him .
DRA	Mark	7	33	And taking him from the multitude apart , he put his fingers into his ears , and spitting , he touched his tongue :
DRA	Mark	7	34	And looking up to heaven , he groaned , and said to him : Ephpheta , which is , Be thou opened .
DRA	Mark	7	35	And immediately his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spoke right .
DRA	Mark	7	36	And he charged them that they should tell no man . But the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal did they publish it .
DRA	Mark	7	37	And so much the more did they wonder , saying : He hath done all things well ; he hath made both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Mark	8	8	And they did eat and were filled ; and they took up that which was left of the fragments , seven baskets .
DRA	Mark	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Mark	8	2	I have compassion on the multitude , for behold they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat .
DRA	Mark	8	3	And if I shall send them away fasting to their home , they will faint in the way ; for some of them came from afar off .
DRA	Mark	8	4	And his disciples answered him : From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness ?
DRA	Mark	8	5	And he asked them : How many loaves have ye ? Who said : Seven .
DRA	Mark	8	6	And taking the seven loaves , giving thanks , he broke , and gave to his disciples for to set before them ; and they set them before the people .
DRA	Mark	8	7	And they had a few little fishes ; and he blessed them , and commanded them to be set before them .
DRA	Mark	8	9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand ; and he sent them away .
DRA	Mark	8	10	And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples , he came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
DRA	Mark	8	11	And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , asking him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
DRA	Mark	8	12	And sighing deeply in spirit , he saith : Why doth this generation seek a sign ? Amen , I say to you , a sign shall not be given to this generation .
DRA	Mark	8	13	And leaving them , he went up again into the ship , and passed to the other side of the water .
DRA	Mark	8	14	And they forgot to take bread ; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship .
DRA	Mark	8	15	And he charged them , saying : Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
DRA	Mark	8	16	And they reasoned among themselves , saying : Because we have no bread .
DRA	Mark	8	17	Which Jesus knowing , saith to them : Why do you reason , because you have no bread ? do you not yet know nor understand ? have you still your heart blinded ?
DRA	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , see you not ? and having ears , hear you not ? neither do you remember .
DRA	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took you up ? They say to him , Twelve .
DRA	Mark	8	20	When also the seven loaves among four thousand , how many baskets of fragments took you up ? And they say to him , Seven .
DRA	Mark	8	21	And he said to them : How do you not yet understand ?
DRA	Mark	8	22	And they came to Bethsaida ; and they bring to him a blind man , and they besought him that he would touch him .
DRA	Mark	8	23	And taking the blind man by the hand , he led him out of the town ; and spitting upon his eyes , laying his hands on him , he asked him if he saw any thing .
DRA	Mark	8	24	And looking up , he said : I see men as it were trees , walking .
DRA	Mark	8	25	After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes , and he began to see , and was restored , so that he saw all things clearly .
DRA	Mark	8	26	And he sent him into his house , saying : Go into thy house , and if thou enter into the town , tell nobody .
DRA	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi . And in the way , he asked his disciples , saying to them : Whom do men say that I am ?
DRA	Mark	8	28	Who answered him , saying : John the Baptist ; but some Elias , and others as one of the prophets .
DRA	Mark	8	29	Then he saith to them : But whom do you say that I am ? Peter answering said to him : Thou art the Christ .
DRA	Mark	8	30	And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of him .
DRA	Mark	8	31	And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests , and the scribes , and be killed : and after three days rise again .
DRA	Mark	8	32	And he spoke the word openly . And Peter taking him , began to rebuke him .
DRA	Mark	8	33	Who turning about and seeing his disciples , threatened Peter , saying : Go behind me , Satan , because thou savorest not the things that are of God , but that are of men .
DRA	Mark	8	34	And calling the multitude together with his disciples , he said to them : If any man will follow me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
DRA	Mark	8	35	For whosoever will save his life , shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel , shall save it .
DRA	Mark	8	36	For what shall it profit a man , if he gain the whole world , and suffer the loss of his soul ?
DRA	Mark	8	37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
DRA	Mark	8	38	For he that shall be ashamed of me , and of my words , in this adulterous and sinful generation : the Son of man also will be ashamed of him , when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
DRA	Mark	8	39	And he said to them : Amen I say to you , that there are some of them that stand here , who shall not taste death , till they see the kingdom of God coming in power . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Mark	9	9	And they kept the word to themselves ; questioning together what that should mean , when he shall be risen from the dead .
DRA	Mark	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Mark	9	2	And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow , so as no fuller upon earth can make white .
DRA	Mark	9	3	And there appeared to them Elias with Moses ; and they were talking with Jesus .
DRA	Mark	9	4	And Peter answering , said to Jesus : Rabbi , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
DRA	Mark	9	5	For he knew not what he said : for they were struck with fear .
DRA	Mark	9	6	And there was a cloud overshadowing them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying : This is my most beloved son ; hear ye him .
DRA	Mark	9	7	And immediately looking about , they saw no man any more , but Jesus only with them .
DRA	Mark	9	8	And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen , till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead .
DRA	Mark	9	10	And they asked him , saying : Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elias must come first ?
DRA	Mark	9	11	Who answering , said to them : Elias , when he shall come first , shall restore all things ; and as it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things and be despised .
DRA	Mark	9	12	But I say to you , that Elias also is come , ( and they have done to him whatsoever they would , ) as it is written of him .
DRA	Mark	9	13	And coming to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes disputing with them .
DRA	Mark	9	14	And presently all the people seeing Jesus , were astonished and struck with fear ; and running to him , they saluted him .
DRA	Mark	9	15	And he asked them : What do you question about among you ?
DRA	Mark	9	16	And one of the multitude , answering , said : Master , I have brought my son to thee , having a dumb spirit .
DRA	Mark	9	17	Who , wheresoever he taketh him , dasheth him , and he foameth , and gnasheth with the teeth , and pineth away ; and I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out , and they could not .
DRA	Mark	9	18	Who answering them , said : O incredulous generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me .
DRA	Mark	9	19	And they brought him . And when he had seen him , immediately the spirit troubled him ; and being thrown down upon the ground , he rolled about foaming .
DRA	Mark	9	20	And he asked his father : How long time is it since this hath happened unto him ? But he said : From his infancy :
DRA	Mark	9	21	And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy him . But if thou canst do any thing , help us , having compassion on us .
DRA	Mark	9	22	And Jesus saith to him : If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
DRA	Mark	9	23	And immediately the father of the boy crying out , with tears said : I do believe , Lord : help my unbelief .
DRA	Mark	9	24	And when Jesus saw the multitude running together , he threatened the unclean spirit , saying to him : Deaf and dumb spirit , I command thee , go out of him ; and enter not any more into him .
DRA	Mark	9	25	And crying out , and greatly tearing him , he went out of him , and he became as dead , so that many said : He is dead .
DRA	Mark	9	26	But Jesus taking him by the hand , lifted him up ; and he arose .
DRA	Mark	9	27	And when he was come into the house , his disciples secretly asked him : Why could not we cast him out ?
DRA	Mark	9	28	And he said to them : This kind can go out by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
DRA	Mark	9	29	And departing from thence , they passed through Galilee , and he would not that any man should know it .
DRA	Mark	9	30	And he taught his disciples , and said to them : The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise again the third day .
DRA	Mark	9	31	But they understood not the word , and they were afraid to ask him .
DRA	Mark	9	32	And they came to Capharnaum . And when they were in the house , he asked them : What did you treat of in the way ?
DRA	Mark	9	33	But they held their peace , for in the way they had disputed among themselves , which of them should be the greatest .
DRA	Mark	9	34	And sitting down , he called the twelve , and saith to them : If any man desire to be first , he shall be the last of all , and the minister of all .
DRA	Mark	9	35	And taking a child , he set him in the midst of them . Whom when he had embraced , he saith to them :
DRA	Mark	9	36	Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name , receiveth me . And whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
DRA	Mark	9	37	John answered him , saying : Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , who followeth not us , and we forbade him .
DRA	Mark	9	38	But Jesus said : Do not forbid him . For there is no man that doth a miracle in my name , and can soon speak ill of me .
DRA	Mark	9	39	For he that is not against you , is for you .
DRA	Mark	9	40	For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name , because you belong to Christ : amen I say to you , he shall not lose his reward .
DRA	Mark	9	41	And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me ; it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
DRA	Mark	9	42	And if thy hand scandalize thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life , maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into unquenchable fire :
DRA	Mark	9	43	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not extinguished .
DRA	Mark	9	44	And if thy foot scandalize thee , cut it off . It is better for thee to enter lame into life everlasting , than having two feet , to be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire :
DRA	Mark	9	45	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not extinguished .
DRA	Mark	9	46	And if thy eye scandalize thee , pluck it out . It is better for thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God , than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire :
DRA	Mark	9	47	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not extinguished .
DRA	Mark	9	48	For every one shall be salted with fire : and every victim shall be salted with salt .
DRA	Mark	9	49	Salt is good . But if the salt became unsavoury ; wherewith will you season it ? Have salt in you , and have peace among you . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Mark	10	10	And in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the same thing .
DRA	Mark	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Mark	10	2	And the Pharisees coming to him asked him : Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
DRA	Mark	10	3	But he answering , saith to them : What did Moses command you ?
DRA	Mark	10	4	Who said : Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce , and to put her away .
DRA	Mark	10	5	To whom Jesus answering , said : Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you that precept .
DRA	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation , God made them male and female .
DRA	Mark	10	7	For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother ; and shall cleave to his wife .
DRA	Mark	10	8	And they two shall be in one flesh . Therefore now they are not two , but one flesh .
DRA	Mark	10	9	What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
DRA	Mark	10	11	And he saith to them : Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
DRA	Mark	10	12	And if the wife shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
DRA	Mark	10	13	And they brought to him young children , that he might touch them . And the disciples rebuked them that brought them .
DRA	Mark	10	14	Whom when Jesus saw , he was much displeased , and saith to them : Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not ; for of such is the kingdom of God .
DRA	Mark	10	15	Amen I say to you , whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , shall not enter into it .
DRA	Mark	10	16	And embracing them , and laying his hands upon them , he blessed them .
DRA	Mark	10	17	And when he was gone forth into the way , a certain man running up and kneeling before him , asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting ?
DRA	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? None is good but one , that is God .
DRA	Mark	10	19	Thou knowest the commandments : Do not commit adultery , do not kill , do not steal , bear not false witness , do no fraud , honour thy father and mother .
DRA	Mark	10	20	But he answering , said to him : Master , all these things I have observed from my youth .
DRA	Mark	10	21	And Jesus looking on him , loved him , and said to him : One thing is wanting unto thee : go , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me .
DRA	Mark	10	22	Who being struck sad at that saying , went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
DRA	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looking round about , saith to his disciples : How hardly shall they that have riches , enter into the kingdom of God !
DRA	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus again answering , saith to them : Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches , to enter into the kingdom of God ?
DRA	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
DRA	Mark	10	26	Who wondered the more , saying among themselves : Who then can be saved ?
DRA	Mark	10	27	And Jesus looking on them , saith : With men it is impossible ; but not with God : for all things are possible with God .
DRA	Mark	10	28	And Peter began to say unto him : Behold , we have left all things , and have followed thee .
DRA	Mark	10	29	Jesus answering , said : Amen I say to you , there is no man who hath left house or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or children , or lands , for my sake and for the gospel ,
DRA	Mark	10	30	Who shall not receive an hundred times as much , now in this time ; houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions : and in the world to come life everlasting .
DRA	Mark	10	31	But many that are first , shall be last : and the last , first .
DRA	Mark	10	32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem : and Jesus went before them , and they were astonished ; and following were afraid . And taking again the twelve , he began to tell them the things that should befall him .
DRA	Mark	10	33	Saying : Behold we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests , and to the scribes and ancients , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles .
DRA	Mark	10	34	And they shall mock him , and spit on him , and scourge him , and kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
DRA	Mark	10	35	And James and John the sons of Zebedee , come to him , saying : Master , we desire that whatsoever we shall ask , thou wouldst do it for us :
DRA	Mark	10	36	But he said to them : What would you that I should do for you ?
DRA	Mark	10	37	And they said : Grant to us , that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
DRA	Mark	10	38	And Jesus said to them : You know not what you ask . Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of : or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized ?
DRA	Mark	10	39	But they said to him : We can . And Jesus saith to them : You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of : and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized , you shall be baptized .
DRA	Mark	10	40	But to sit on my right hand , or on my left , is not mine to give to you , but to them for whom it is prepared .
DRA	Mark	10	41	And the ten hearing it , began to be much displeased at James and John .
DRA	Mark	10	42	But Jesus calling them , saith to them : You know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles , lord it over them : and their princes have power over them .
DRA	Mark	10	43	But it is not so among you : but whosoever will be greater , shall be your minister .
DRA	Mark	10	44	And whosoever will be first among you , shall be the servant of all .
DRA	Mark	10	45	For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a redemption for many .
DRA	Mark	10	46	And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho , with his disciples , and a very great multitude , Bartimeus the blind man , the son of Timeus , sat by the way side begging .
DRA	Mark	10	47	Who when he had heard , that it was Jesus of Nazareth , began to cry out , and to say : Jesus son of David , have mercy on me .
DRA	Mark	10	48	And many rebuked him , that he might hold his peace ; but he cried a great deal the more : Son of David , have mercy on me .
DRA	Mark	10	49	And Jesus , standing still , commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying to him : Be of better comfort : arise , he calleth thee .

DRA	Mark	11	3	And if any man shall say to you , What are you doing ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him : and immediately he will let him come hither .
DRA	Mark	11	4	And going their way , they found the colt tied before the gate without , in the meeting of two ways : and they loose him .
DRA	Mark	11	5	And some of them that stood there , said to them : What do you loosing the colt ?
DRA	Mark	11	6	Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them ; and they let him go with them .
DRA	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus ; and they lay their garments on him , and he sat upon him .
DRA	Mark	11	8	And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down boughs from the trees , and strewed them in the way .

DRA	Mark	11	26	But if you will not forgive , neither will your Father that is in heaven , forgive you your sins .

DRA	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? Answer me .

DRA	Mark	12	2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant to receive of the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
DRA	Mark	12	3	Who having laid hands on him , beat him , and sent him away empty .
DRA	Mark	12	4	And again he sent to them another servant ; and him they wounded in the head , and used him reproachfully .
DRA	Mark	12	5	And again he sent another , and him they killed : and many others , of whom some they beat , and others they killed .
DRA	Mark	12	6	Therefore having yet one son , most dear to him ; he also sent him unto them last of all , saying : They will reverence my son .
DRA	Mark	12	7	But the husbandmen said one to another : This is the heir ; come let us kill him ; and the inheritance shall be ours .
DRA	Mark	12	8	And laying hold on him , they killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
DRA	Mark	12	9	What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy those husbandmen ; and will give the vineyard to others .
DRA	Mark	12	10	And have you not read this scripture , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is made the head of the corner :
DRA	Mark	12	11	By the Lord has this been done , and it is wonderful in our eyes .
DRA	Mark	12	13	And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians ; that they should catch him in his words .
DRA	Mark	12	14	Who coming , say to him : Master , we know that thou art a true speaker , and carest not for any man ; for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth . Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar ; or shall we not give it ?
DRA	Mark	12	15	Who knowing their wiliness , saith to them : Why tempt you me ? bring me a penny that I may see it .
DRA	Mark	12	16	And they brought it him . And he saith to them : Whose is this image and inscription ? They say to him , Caesar 's .

DRA	Mark	12	18	And there came to him the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying :
DRA	Mark	12	19	Master , Moses wrote unto us , that if any man 's brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother .
DRA	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brethren ; and the first took a wife , and died leaving no issue .
DRA	Mark	12	21	And the second took her , and died : and neither did he leave any issue . And the third in like manner .
DRA	Mark	12	22	And the seven all took her in like manner ; and did not leave issue . Last of all the woman also died .
DRA	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise again , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
DRA	Mark	12	24	And Jesus answering , saith to them : Do ye not therefore err , because you know not the scriptures , nor the power of God ?
DRA	Mark	12	25	For when they shall rise again from the dead , they shall neither marry , nor be married , but are as the angels in heaven .
DRA	Mark	12	26	And as concerning the dead that they rise again , have you not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spoke to him , saying : I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
DRA	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living . You therefore do greatly err .
DRA	Mark	12	28	And there came one of the scribes that had heard them reasoning together , and seeing that he had answered them well , asked him which was the first commandment of all .

DRA	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to him : Well , Master , thou hast said in truth , that there is one God , and there is no other besides him .
DRA	Mark	12	33	And that he should be loved with the whole heart , and with the whole understanding , and with the whole soul , and with the whole strength ; and to love one 's neighbour as one 's self , is a greater thing than all holocausts and sacrifices .
DRA	Mark	12	34	And Jesus seeing that he had answered wisely , said to him : Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question .
DRA	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answering , said , teaching in the temple : How do the scribes say , that Christ is the son of David ?
DRA	Mark	12	36	For David himself saith by the Holy Ghost : The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand , until I make thy enemies thy footstool .
DRA	Mark	12	37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord , and whence is he then his son ? And a great multitude heard him gladly .
DRA	Mark	12	38	And he said to them in his doctrine : Beware of the scribes , who love to walk in long robes , and to be saluted in the marketplace ,
DRA	Mark	12	39	And to sit in the first chairs , in the synagogues , and to have the highest places at suppers :
DRA	Mark	12	40	Who devour the houses of widows under the pretence of long prayer : these shall receive greater judgment .
DRA	Mark	12	41	And Jesus sitting over against the treasury , beheld how the people cast money into the treasury , and many that were rich cast in much .
DRA	Mark	12	42	And there came a certain poor widow , and she cast in two mites , which make a farthing .
DRA	Mark	12	43	And calling his disciples together , he saith to them : Amen I say to you , this poor widow hath cast in more than all they who have cast into the treasury .
DRA	Mark	12	44	For all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want cast in all she had , even her whole living . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Mark	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	Mark	13	2	And Jesus answering , said to him : Seest thou all these great buildings ? There shall not be left a stone upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down .
DRA	Mark	13	3	And as he sat on the mount of Olivet over against the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart :
DRA	Mark	13	4	Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall begin to be fulfilled ?
DRA	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answering , began to say to them , Take heed lest any man deceive you .
DRA	Mark	13	6	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am he ; and they shall deceive many .
DRA	Mark	13	7	And when you shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , fear ye not . For such things must needs be , but the end is not yet .
DRA	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and famines . These things are the beginning of sorrows .
DRA	Mark	13	9	But look to yourselves . For they shall deliver you up to councils , and in the synagogues you shall be beaten , and you shall stand before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony unto them .
DRA	Mark	13	10	And unto all nations the gospel must first be preached .
DRA	Mark	13	11	And when they shall lead you and deliver you up , be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak ; but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye . For it is not you that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
DRA	Mark	13	12	And the brother shall betray his brother unto death , and the father his son ; and children shall rise up against the parents , and shall work their death .
DRA	Mark	13	14	And when you shall see the abomination of desolation , standing where it ought not : he that readeth let him understand : then let them that are in Judea , flee unto the mountains :
DRA	Mark	13	15	And let him that is on the housetop , not go down into the house , nor enter therein to take any thing out of the house :
DRA	Mark	13	16	And let him that shall be in the field , not turn back to take up his garment .
DRA	Mark	13	17	And woe to them that are with child , and that give suck in those days .
DRA	Mark	13	18	But pray ye , that these things happen not in winter .
DRA	Mark	13	19	For in those days shall be such tribulations , as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , neither shall be .
DRA	Mark	13	20	And unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh should be saved : but for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
DRA	Mark	13	21	And then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; lo , he is here : do not believe .
DRA	Mark	13	22	For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets , and they shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce ( if it were possible ) even the elect .
DRA	Mark	13	23	Take you heed therefore ; behold I have foretold you all things .
DRA	Mark	13	24	But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light .
DRA	Mark	13	25	And the stars of heaven shall be falling down , and the powers that are in heaven , shall be moved .
DRA	Mark	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds , with great power and glory .
DRA	Mark	13	27	And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
DRA	Mark	13	28	Now of the fig tree learn ye a parable . When the branch thereof is now tender , and the leaves are come forth , you know that summer is very near .
DRA	Mark	13	29	So you also when you shall see these things come to pass , know ye that it is very nigh , even at the doors .
DRA	Mark	13	30	Amen I say to you , that this generation shall not pass , until all these things be done .
DRA	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my word shall not pass away .
DRA	Mark	13	32	But of that day or hour no man knoweth , neither the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but the Father .
DRA	Mark	13	33	Take ye heed , watch and pray . For ye know not when the time is .
DRA	Mark	13	34	Even as a man who going into a far country , left his house ; and gave authority to his servants over every work , and commanded the porter to watch .
DRA	Mark	13	35	Watch ye therefore , ( for you know not when the lord of the house cometh : at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning , )
DRA	Mark	13	36	Lest coming on a sudden , he find you sleeping .
DRA	Mark	13	37	And what I say to you , I say to all : Watch . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Mark	14	3	And when he was in Bethania , in the house of Simon the leper , and was at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard : and breaking the alabaster box , she poured it out upon his head .
DRA	Mark	14	4	Now there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said : Why was this waste of the ointment made ?
DRA	Mark	14	5	For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and given to the poor . And they murmured against her .
DRA	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said : Let her alone , why do you molest her ? She hath wrought a good work upon me .
DRA	Mark	14	7	For the poor you have always with you : and whensoever you will , you may do them good : but me you have not always .
DRA	Mark	14	8	She hath done what she could : she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial .
DRA	Mark	14	9	Amen , I say to you , wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , that also which she hath done , shall be told for a memorial of her .

DRA	Mark	14	15	And he will shew you a large dining room furnished ; and there prepare ye for us .
DRA	Mark	14	16	And his disciples went their way , and came into the city ; and they found as he had told them , and they prepared the pasch .
DRA	Mark	14	17	And when evening was come , he cometh with the twelve .
DRA	Mark	14	18	And when they were at table and eating , Jesus saith : Amen I say to you , one of you that eateth with me shall betray me .
DRA	Mark	14	19	But they began to be sorrowful , and to say to him one by one : Is it I ?
DRA	Mark	14	20	Who saith to them : One of the twelve , who dippeth with me his hand in the dish .
DRA	Mark	14	21	And the Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed . It were better for him , if that man had not been born .

DRA	Mark	14	26	And when they had said an hymn , they went forth to the mount of Olives .
DRA	Mark	14	27	And Jesus saith to them : You will all be scandalized in my regard this night ; for it is written , I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep shall be dispersed .
DRA	Mark	14	28	But after I shall be risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
DRA	Mark	14	29	But Peter saith to him : Although all shall be scandalized in thee , yet not I .
DRA	Mark	14	30	And Jesus saith to him : Amen I say to thee , to day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shall deny me thrice .
DRA	Mark	14	31	But he spoke the more vehemently : Although I should die together with thee , I will not deny thee . And in like manner also said they all .

DRA	Mark	14	38	Watch ye , and pray that you enter not into temptation . The spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
DRA	Mark	14	39	And going away again , he prayed , saying the same words .
DRA	Mark	14	40	And when he returned , he found them again asleep , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) and they knew not what to answer him .

DRA	Mark	14	46	But they laid hands on him , and held him .
DRA	Mark	14	47	And one of them that stood by , drawing a sword , struck a servant of the chief priest , and cut off his ear .
DRA	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answering , said to them : Are you come out as to a robber , with swords and staves to apprehend me ?
DRA	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and you did not lay hands on me . But that the scriptures may be fulfilled .
DRA	Mark	14	50	Then his disciples leaving him , all fled away .

DRA	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed him from afar off , even into the court of the high priest ; and he sat with the servants at the fire , and warmed himself .
DRA	Mark	14	55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus , that they might put him to death , and found none .
DRA	Mark	14	56	For many bore false witness against him , and their evidences were not agreeing .
DRA	Mark	14	57	And some rising up , bore false witness against him , saying :
DRA	Mark	14	58	We heard him say , I will destroy this temple made with hands , and within three days I will build another not made with hands .
DRA	Mark	14	59	And their witness did not agree .
DRA	Mark	14	60	And the high priest rising up in the midst , asked Jesus , saying : Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men ?
DRA	Mark	14	61	But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said to him : Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God ?
DRA	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said to him : I am . And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God , and coming with the clouds of heaven .
DRA	Mark	14	63	Then the high priest rending his garments , saith : What need we any further witnesses ?
DRA	Mark	14	64	You have heard the blasphemy . What think you ? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death .
DRA	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him : Prophesy : and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands .
DRA	Mark	14	66	Now when Peter was in the court below , there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest .
DRA	Mark	14	67	And when she had seen Peter warming himself , looking on him she saith : Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
DRA	Mark	14	68	But he denied , saying : I neither know nor understand what thou sayest . And he went forth before the court ; and the cock crew .
DRA	Mark	14	69	And again a maidservant seeing him , began to say to the standers by : This is one of them .
DRA	Mark	14	70	But he denied again . And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter : Surely thou art one of them ; for thou art also a Galilean .
DRA	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse and to swear , saying ; I know not this man of whom you speak .
DRA	Mark	14	72	And immediately the cock crew again . And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him : Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt thrice deny me . And he began to weep . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Mark	15	2	And Pilate asked him : Art thou the king of the Jews ? But he answering , saith to him : Thou sayest it .
DRA	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused him in many things .
DRA	Mark	15	4	And Pilate again asked him , saying : Answerest thou nothing ? behold in how many things they accuse thee .
DRA	Mark	15	5	But Jesus still answered nothing ; so that Pilate wondered .
DRA	Mark	15	6	Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners , whomsoever they demanded .
DRA	Mark	15	7	And there was one called Barabbas , who was put in prison with some seditious men , who in the sedition had committed murder .
DRA	Mark	15	8	And when the multitude was come up , they began to desire that he would do , as he had ever done unto them .
DRA	Mark	15	9	And Pilate answered them , and said : Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews ?
DRA	Mark	15	10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy .
DRA	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas to them .
DRA	Mark	15	12	And Pilate again answering , saith to them : What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews ?
DRA	Mark	15	13	But they again cried out : Crucify him .
DRA	Mark	15	14	And Pilate saith to them : Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more : Crucify him .
DRA	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace , and they called together the whole band :
DRA	Mark	15	17	And they clothe him with purple , and platting a crown of thorns , they put it upon him .
DRA	Mark	15	18	And they began to salute him : Hail , king of the Jews .
DRA	Mark	15	19	And they struck his head with a reed : and they did spit on him . And bowing their knees , they adored him .
DRA	Mark	15	20	And after they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own garments on him , and they led him out to crucify him .
DRA	Mark	15	21	And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and of Rufus , to take up his cross .
DRA	Mark	15	22	And they bring him into the place called Golgotha , which being interpreted is , The place of Calvary .
DRA	Mark	15	23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh ; but he took it not .
DRA	Mark	15	24	And crucifying him , they divided his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
DRA	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
DRA	Mark	15	26	And the inscription of his cause was written over : THE KING OF THE JEWS .
DRA	Mark	15	27	And with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
DRA	Mark	15	28	And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith : And with the wicked he was reputed .
DRA	Mark	15	29	And they that passed by blasphemed him , wagging their heads , and saying : Vah , thou that destroyest the temple of God , and in three days buildest it up again ;
DRA	Mark	15	30	Save thyself , coming down from the cross .
DRA	Mark	15	31	In like manner also the chief priests mocking , said with the scribes one to another : He saved others ; himself he can not save .
DRA	Mark	15	32	Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reviled him .
DRA	Mark	15	33	And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour .
DRA	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour , Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying : Eloi , Eloi , lamma sabacthani ? Which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
DRA	Mark	15	35	And some of the standers by hearing , said : Behold he calleth Elias .
DRA	Mark	15	36	And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar , and putting it upon a reed , gave him to drink , saying : Stay , let us see if Elias come to take him down .
DRA	Mark	15	37	And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice , gave up the ghost .
DRA	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent in two , from the top to the bottom .
DRA	Mark	15	39	And the centurion who stood over against him , seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost , said : Indeed this man was the son of God .
DRA	Mark	15	40	And there were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalen , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph , and Salome :
DRA	Mark	15	41	Who also when he was in Galilee followed him , and ministered to him , and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem .
DRA	Mark	15	42	And when evening was now come , ( because it was the Parasceve , that is , the day before the sabbath , )
DRA	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea , a noble counsellor , who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God , came and went in boldly to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
DRA	Mark	15	44	But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead . And sending for the centurion , he asked him if he were already dead .
DRA	Mark	15	45	And when he had understood it by the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
DRA	Mark	15	46	And Joseph buying fine linen , and taking him down , wrapped him up in the fine linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock . And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre .

DRA	Mark	16	16	He that believeth and is baptized , shall be saved : but he that believeth not shall be condemned .
DRA	Mark	16	1899	American Edition
DRA	Mark	16	2	And very early in the morning , the first day of the week , they come to the sepulchre , the sun being now risen .
DRA	Mark	16	3	And they said one to another : Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre ?
DRA	Mark	16	4	And looking , they saw the stone rolled back . For it was very great .
DRA	Mark	16	5	And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed with a white robe : and they were astonished .
DRA	Mark	16	6	Who saith to them : Be not affrighted ; you seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified : he is risen , he is not here , behold the place where they laid him .
DRA	Mark	16	7	But go , tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee ; there you shall see him , as he told you .
DRA	Mark	16	8	But they going out , fled from the sepulchre . For a trembling and fear had seized them : and they said nothing to any man ; for they were afraid .
DRA	Mark	16	9	But he rising early the first day of the week , appeared first to Mary Magdalen , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
DRA	Mark	16	10	She went and told them that had been with him , who were mourning and weeping .
DRA	Mark	16	11	And they hearing that he was alive , and had been seen by her , did not believe .
DRA	Mark	16	12	And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking , as they were going into the country .
DRA	Mark	16	13	And they going told it to the rest : neither did they believe them .
DRA	Mark	16	14	At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table : and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart , because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again .
DRA	Mark	16	15	And he said to them : Go ye into the whole world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
DRA	Mark	16	17	And these signs shall follow them that believe : In my name they shall cast out devils : they shall speak with new tongues .
DRA	Mark	16	18	They shall take up serpents ; and if they shall drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them : they shall lay their hands upon the sick , and they shall recover .
DRA	Mark	16	19	And the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven , and sitteth on the right hand of God .
DRA	Mark	16	20	But they going forth preached everywhere : the Lord working withal , and confirming the word with signs that followed . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us ;
DRA	Luke	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	1	2	According as they have delivered them unto us , who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word :
DRA	Luke	1	3	It seemed good to me also , having diligently attained to all things from the beginning , to write to thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
DRA	Luke	1	4	That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed .
DRA	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest named Zachary , of the course of Abia ; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name Elizabeth .
DRA	Luke	1	6	And they were both just before God , walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame .
DRA	Luke	1	7	And they had no son , for that Elizabeth was barren , and they both were well advanced in years .
DRA	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass , when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God ,
DRA	Luke	1	9	According to the custom of the priestly office , it was his lot to offer incense , going into the temple of the Lord .
DRA	Luke	1	10	And all the multitude of the people was praying without , at the hour of incense .
DRA	Luke	1	11	And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the alter of incense .
DRA	Luke	1	12	And Zachary seeing him , was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
DRA	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him : Fear not , Zachary , for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John :
DRA	Luke	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness , and many shall rejoice in his nativity .
DRA	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great before the Lord ; and shall drink no wine nor strong drink : and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother 's womb .
DRA	Luke	1	16	And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God .
DRA	Luke	1	17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias ; that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children , and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just , to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people .
DRA	Luke	1	18	And Zachary said to the angel : Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife is advanced in years .
DRA	Luke	1	19	And the angel answering , said to him : I am Gabriel , who stand before God : and am sent to speak to thee , and to bring thee these good tidings .
DRA	Luke	1	20	And behold , thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass , because thou hast not believed my words , which shall be fulfilled in their time .
DRA	Luke	1	21	And the people were waiting for Zachary ; and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple .
DRA	Luke	1	22	And when he came out , he could not speak to them : and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple . And he made signs to them , and remained dumb .
DRA	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , after the days of his office were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
DRA	Luke	1	24	And after those days , Elizabeth his wife conceived , and hid herself five months , saying :
DRA	Luke	1	25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men .
DRA	Luke	1	26	And in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee , called Nazareth ,
DRA	Luke	1	27	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary .
DRA	Luke	1	28	And the angel being come in , said unto her : Hail , full of grace , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
DRA	Luke	1	29	Who having heard , was troubled at his saying , and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be .
DRA	Luke	1	30	And the angel said to her : Fear not , Mary , for thou hast found grace with God .
DRA	Luke	1	31	Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and shalt bring forth a son ; and thou shalt call his name Jesus .
DRA	Luke	1	32	He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the most High ; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father ; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever .
DRA	Luke	1	33	And of his kingdom there shall be no end .
DRA	Luke	1	34	And Mary said to the angel : How shall this be done , because I know not man ?
DRA	Luke	1	35	And the angel answering , said to her : The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee . And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
DRA	Luke	1	36	And behold thy cousin Elizabeth , she also hath conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren :
DRA	Luke	1	37	Because no word shall be impossible with God .
DRA	Luke	1	38	And Mary said : Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it done to me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
DRA	Luke	1	39	And Mary rising up in those days , went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda .
DRA	Luke	1	40	And she entered into the house of Zachary , and saluted Elizabeth .
DRA	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the infant leaped in her womb . And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost :
DRA	Luke	1	42	And she cried out with a loud voice , and said : Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
DRA	Luke	1	43	And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
DRA	Luke	1	44	For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears , the infant in my womb leaped for joy .
DRA	Luke	1	45	And blessed art thou that hast believed , because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord .
DRA	Luke	1	46	And Mary said : My soul doth magnify the Lord .
DRA	Luke	1	47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
DRA	Luke	1	48	Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid ; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
DRA	Luke	1	49	Because he that is mighty , hath done great things to me ; and holy is his name .
DRA	Luke	1	50	And his mercy is from generation unto generations , to them that fear him .
DRA	Luke	1	51	He hath shewed might in his arm : he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart .
DRA	Luke	1	52	He hath put down the mighty from their seat , and hath exalted the humble .
DRA	Luke	1	53	He hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
DRA	Luke	1	54	He hath received Israel his servant , being mindful of his mercy :
DRA	Luke	1	55	As he spoke to our fathers , to Abraham and to his seed for ever .
DRA	Luke	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months ; and she returned to her own house .
DRA	Luke	1	57	Now Elizabeth 's full time of being delivered was come , and she brought forth a son .
DRA	Luke	1	58	And her neighbours and kinsfolks heard that the Lord had shewed his great mercy towards her , and they congratulated with her .
DRA	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they called him by his father 's name Zachary .
DRA	Luke	1	60	And his mother answering , said : Not so ; but he shall be called John .
DRA	Luke	1	61	And they said to her : There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
DRA	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
DRA	Luke	1	63	And demanding a writing table , he wrote , saying : John is his name . And they all wondered .
DRA	Luke	1	64	And immediately his mouth was opened , and his tongue loosed , and he spoke , blessing God .
DRA	Luke	1	65	And fear came upon all their neighbours ; and all these things were noised abroad over all the hill country of Judea .
DRA	Luke	1	66	And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart , saying : What an one , think ye , shall this child be ? For the hand of the Lord was with him .
DRA	Luke	1	67	And Zachary his father was filled with the Holy Ghost ; and he prophesied , saying :
DRA	Luke	1	68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people :
DRA	Luke	1	69	And hath raised up an horn of salvation to us , in the house of David his servant :
DRA	Luke	1	70	As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets , who are from the beginning :
DRA	Luke	1	71	Salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us :
DRA	Luke	1	72	To perform mercy to our fathers , and to remember his holy testament ,
DRA	Luke	1	73	The oath , which he swore to Abraham our father , that he would grant to us ,
DRA	Luke	1	74	That being delivered from the hand of our enemies , we may serve him without fear ,
DRA	Luke	1	75	In holiness and justice before him , all our days .
DRA	Luke	1	76	And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways :
DRA	Luke	1	77	To give knowledge of salvation to his people , unto the remission of their sins :
DRA	Luke	1	78	Through the bowels of the mercy of our God , in which the Orient from on high hath visited us :
DRA	Luke	1	79	To enlighten them that sit in darkness , and in the shadow of death : to direct our feet into the way of peace .
DRA	Luke	1	80	And the child grew , and was strengthened in spirit ; and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	2	2	This enrolling was first made by Cyrinus , the governor of Syria .
DRA	Luke	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	2	3	And all went to be enrolled , every one into his own city .
DRA	Luke	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem : because he was of the house and family of David ,
DRA	Luke	2	5	To be enrolled with Mary his espoused wife , who was with child .
DRA	Luke	2	6	And it came to pass , that when they were there , her days were accomplished , that she should be delivered .
DRA	Luke	2	7	And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
DRA	Luke	2	8	And there were in the same country shepherds watching , and keeping the night watches over their flock .
DRA	Luke	2	9	And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the brightness of God shone round about them ; and they feared with a great fear .
DRA	Luke	2	10	And the angel said to them : Fear not ; for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , that shall be to all the people :
DRA	Luke	2	11	For , this day , is born to you a Saviour , who is Christ the Lord , in the city of David .
DRA	Luke	2	12	And this shall be a sign unto you . You shall find the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes , and laid in a manger .
DRA	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army , praising God , and saying :
DRA	Luke	2	14	Glory to God in the highest ; and on earth peace to men of good will .
DRA	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , after the angels departed from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another : Let us go over to Bethlehem , and let us see this word that is come to pass , which the Lord hath shewed to us .
DRA	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste ; and they found Mary and Joseph , and the infant lying in the manger .
DRA	Luke	2	17	And seeing , they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child .
DRA	Luke	2	18	And all that heard , wondered ; and at those things that were told them by the shepherds .
DRA	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these words , pondering them in her heart .
DRA	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God , for all the things they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
DRA	Luke	2	21	And after eight days were accomplished , that the child should be circumcised , his name was called JESUS , which was called by the angel , before he was conceived in the womb .
DRA	Luke	2	22	And after the days of her purification , according to the law of Moses , were accomplished , they carried him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord :
DRA	Luke	2	23	As it is written in the law of the Lord : Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord :
DRA	Luke	2	24	And to offer a sacrifice , according as it is written in the law of the Lord , a pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons :
DRA	Luke	2	25	And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon , and this man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel ; and the Holy Ghost was in him .
DRA	Luke	2	26	And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Christ of the Lord .
DRA	Luke	2	27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple . And when his parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him according to the custom of the law ,
DRA	Luke	2	28	He also took him into his arms , and blessed God , and said :
DRA	Luke	2	29	Now thou dost dismiss thy servant , O Lord , according to thy word in peace ;
DRA	Luke	2	30	Because my eyes have seen thy salvation ,
DRA	Luke	2	31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples :
DRA	Luke	2	32	A light to the revelation of the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
DRA	Luke	2	33	And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him .
DRA	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary his mother : Behold this child is set for the fall , and for the resurrection of many in Israel , and for a sign which shall be contradicted ;
DRA	Luke	2	35	And thy own soul a sword shall pierce , that , out of many hearts , thoughts may be revealed .
DRA	Luke	2	36	And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser ; she was far advanced in years , and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity .
DRA	Luke	2	37	And she was a widow until fourscore and four years ; who departed not from the temple , by fastings and prayers serving night and day .
DRA	Luke	2	38	Now she , at the same hour , coming in , confessed to the Lord ; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel .
DRA	Luke	2	39	And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their city Nazareth .
DRA	Luke	2	40	And the child grew , and waxed strong , full of wisdom ; and the grace of God was in him .
DRA	Luke	2	41	And his parents went every year to Jerusalem , at the solemn day of the pasch ,
DRA	Luke	2	42	And when he was twelve years old , they going up into Jerusalem , according to the custom of the feast ,
DRA	Luke	2	43	And having fulfilled the days , when they returned , the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem ; and his parents knew it not .
DRA	Luke	2	44	And thinking that he was in the company , they came a day 's journey , and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance .
DRA	Luke	2	45	And not finding him , they returned into Jerusalem , seeking him .
DRA	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass , that , after three days , they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , hearing them , and asking them questions .
DRA	Luke	2	47	And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers .
DRA	Luke	2	48	And seeing him , they wondered . And his mother said to him : Son , why hast thou done so to us ? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing .
DRA	Luke	2	49	And he said to them : How is it that you sought me ? did you not know , that I must be about my father 's business ?
DRA	Luke	2	50	And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them .
DRA	Luke	2	51	And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject to them . And his mother kept all these words in her heart .

DRA	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the country about the Jordan , preaching the baptism of penance for the remission of sins ;
DRA	Luke	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	3	2	Under the high priests Annas and Caiphas ; the word of the Lord was made unto John , the son of Zachary , in the desert .
DRA	Luke	3	4	As it was written in the book of the sayings of Isaias the prophet : A voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make straight his paths .
DRA	Luke	3	5	Every valley shall be filled ; and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight ; and the rough ways plain ;
DRA	Luke	3	6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
DRA	Luke	3	7	He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized by him : Ye offspring of vipers , who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come ?
DRA	Luke	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of penance ; and do not begin to say , We have Abraham for our father . For I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham .
DRA	Luke	3	9	For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees . Every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit , shall be cut down and cast into the fire .
DRA	Luke	3	10	And the people asked him , saying : What then shall we do ?
DRA	Luke	3	11	And he answering , said to them : He that hath two coats , let him give to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do in like manner .
DRA	Luke	3	12	And the publicans also came to be baptized , and said to him : Master , what shall we do ?
DRA	Luke	3	13	But he said to them : Do nothing more than that which is appointed you .
DRA	Luke	3	14	And the soldiers also asked him , saying : And what shall we do ? And he said to them : Do violence to no man ; neither calumniate any man ; and be content with your pay .
DRA	Luke	3	15	And as the people were of opinion , and all were thinking in their hearts of John , that perhaps he might be the Christ ;
DRA	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying unto all : I indeed baptize you with water ; but there shall come one mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to loose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost , and with fire :
DRA	Luke	3	17	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his barn ; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire .
DRA	Luke	3	18	And many other things exhorting , did he preach to the people .
DRA	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , when he was reproved by him for Herodias , his brother 's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ;
DRA	Luke	3	20	He added this also above all , and shut up John in prison .
DRA	Luke	3	21	Now it came to pass , when all the people were baptized , that Jesus also being baptized and praying , heaven was opened ;
DRA	Luke	3	22	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape , as a dove upon him ; and a voice came from heaven : Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .

DRA	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered him : It is written , that Man liveth not by bread alone , but by every word of God .
DRA	Luke	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	4	2	For the space of forty days ; and was tempted by the devil . And he ate nothing in those days ; and when they were ended , he was hungry .
DRA	Luke	4	3	And the devil said to him : If thou be the Son of God , say to this stone that it be made bread .
DRA	Luke	4	5	And the devil led him into a high mountain , and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time ;
DRA	Luke	4	6	And he said to him : To thee will I give all this power , and the glory of them ; for to me they are delivered , and to whom I will , I give them .
DRA	Luke	4	7	If thou therefore wilt adore before me , all shall be thine .
DRA	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answering said to him : It is written : Thou shalt adore the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
DRA	Luke	4	9	And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and he said to him : If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself from hence .
DRA	Luke	4	10	For it is written , that He hath given his angels charge over thee , that they keep thee .
DRA	Luke	4	11	And that in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone .
DRA	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answering , said to him : It is said : Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
DRA	Luke	4	13	And all the temptation being ended , the devil departed from him for a time .
DRA	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit , into Galilee , and the fame of him went out through the whole country .
DRA	Luke	4	15	And he taught in their synagogues , and was magnified by all .
DRA	Luke	4	16	And he came to Nazareth , where he was brought up : and he went into the synagogue , according to his custom , on the sabbath day ; and he rose up to read .
DRA	Luke	4	17	And the book of Isaias the prophet was delivered unto him . And as he unfolded the book , he found the place where it was written :
DRA	Luke	4	18	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me . Wherefore he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor , he hath sent me to heal the contrite of heart ,
DRA	Luke	4	19	To preach deliverance to the captives , and sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised , to preach the acceptable year of the Lord , and the day of reward .
DRA	Luke	4	20	And when he had folded the book , he restored it to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him .
DRA	Luke	4	21	And he began to say to them : This day is fulfilled this scripture in your ears .
DRA	Luke	4	22	And all gave testimony to him : and they wondered at the words of grace that proceeded from his mouth , and they said : Is not this the son of Joseph ?
DRA	Luke	4	23	And he said to them : Doubtless you will say to me this similitude : Physician , heal thyself : as great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum , do also here in thy own country .
DRA	Luke	4	24	And he said : Amen I say to you , that no prophet is accepted in his own country .
DRA	Luke	4	25	In truth I say to you , there were many widows in the days of Elias in Israel , when heaven was shut up three years and six months , when there was a great famine throughout all the earth .
DRA	Luke	4	26	And to none of them was Elias sent , but to Sarepta of Sidon , to a widow woman .
DRA	Luke	4	27	And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet : and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian .
DRA	Luke	4	28	And all they in the synagogue , hearing these things , were filled with anger .
DRA	Luke	4	29	And they rose up and thrust him out of the city ; and they brought him to the brow of the hill , whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
DRA	Luke	4	30	But he passing through the midst of them , went his way .

DRA	Luke	4	32	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his speech was with power .
DRA	Luke	4	33	And in the synagogue there was a man who had an unclean devil , and he cried out with a loud voice ,
DRA	Luke	4	34	Saying : Let us alone , what have we to do with thee , Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the holy one of God .
DRA	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying : Hold thy peace , and go out of him . And when the devil had thrown him into the midst , he went out of him , and hurt him not at all .
DRA	Luke	4	36	And there came fear upon all , and they talked among themselves , saying : What word is this , for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they go out ?
DRA	Luke	4	37	And the fame of him was published into every place of the country .
DRA	Luke	4	38	And Jesus rising up out of the synagogue , went into Simon 's house . And Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever , and they besought him for her .

DRA	Luke	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	5	2	And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
DRA	Luke	5	3	And going into one of the ships that was Simon 's , he desired him to draw back a little from the land . And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship .
DRA	Luke	5	4	Now when he had ceased to speak , he said to Simon : Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
DRA	Luke	5	6	And when they had done this , they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes , and their net broke .
DRA	Luke	5	7	And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they were almost sinking .
DRA	Luke	5	8	Which when Simon Peter saw , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying : Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
DRA	Luke	5	9	For he was wholly astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken .
DRA	Luke	5	10	And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee , who were Simon 's partners . And Jesus saith to Simon : Fear not : from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
DRA	Luke	5	11	And having brought their ships to land , leaving all things , they followed him .
DRA	Luke	5	12	And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy , who seeing Jesus , and falling on his face , besought him , saying : Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
DRA	Luke	5	13	And stretching forth his hand , he touched him , saying : I will . Be thou cleansed . And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
DRA	Luke	5	14	And he charged him that he should tell no man , but , Go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded , for a testimony to them .
DRA	Luke	5	15	But the fame of him went abroad the more , and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
DRA	Luke	5	16	And he retired into the desert , and prayed .
DRA	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass on a certain day , as he sat teaching , that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , that were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judea and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was to heal them .
DRA	Luke	5	18	And behold , men brought in a bed a man , who had the palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
DRA	Luke	5	19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in , because of the multitude , they went up upon the roof , and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus .
DRA	Luke	5	20	Whose faith when he saw , he said : Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
DRA	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and Pharisees began to think , saying : Who is this who speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
DRA	Luke	5	22	And when Jesus knew their thoughts , answering , he said to them : What is it you think in your hearts ?
DRA	Luke	5	23	Which is easier to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise and walk ?
DRA	Luke	5	24	But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy , ) I say to thee , Arise , take up thy bed , and go into thy house .
DRA	Luke	5	25	And immediately rising up before them , he took up the bed on which he lay ; and he went away to his own house , glorifying God .
DRA	Luke	5	26	And all were astonished ; and they glorified God . And they were filled with fear , saying : We have seen wonderful things to day .
DRA	Luke	5	27	And after these things he went forth , and saw a publican named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom , and he said to him : Follow me .
DRA	Luke	5	28	And leaving all things , he rose up and followed him .
DRA	Luke	5	29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house ; and there was a great company of publicans , and of others , that were at table with them .
DRA	Luke	5	30	But the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying to his disciples : Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
DRA	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering , said to them : They that are whole , need not the physician : but they that are sick .
DRA	Luke	5	32	I came not to call the just , but sinners to penance .
DRA	Luke	5	33	And they said to him : Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner ; but thine eat and drink ?
DRA	Luke	5	34	To whom he said : Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast , whilst the bridegroom is with them ?
DRA	Luke	5	35	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , then shall they fast in those days .
DRA	Luke	5	36	And he spoke also a similitude to them : That no man putteth a piece from a new garment upon an old garment ; otherwise he both rendeth the new , and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old .
DRA	Luke	5	37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles : otherwise the new wine will break the bottles , and it will be spilled , and the bottles will be lost .
DRA	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
DRA	Luke	5	39	And no man drinking old , hath presently a mind to new : for he saith , The old is better . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	6	6	And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue , and taught . And there was a man , whose right hand was withered .
DRA	Luke	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	6	2	And some of the Pharisees said to them : Why do you that which is not lawful on the sabbath days ?
DRA	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering them , said : Have you not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was hungry , and they that were with him :
DRA	Luke	6	4	How he went into the house of God , and took and ate the bread of proposition , and gave to them that were with him , which is not lawful to eat but only for the priests ?
DRA	Luke	6	5	And he said to them : The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
DRA	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find an accusation against him .
DRA	Luke	6	8	But he knew their thoughts ; and said to the man who had the withered hand : Arise , and stand forth in the midst . And rising he stood forth .
DRA	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them : I ask you , if it be lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ; to save life , or to destroy ?
DRA	Luke	6	10	And looking round about on them all , he said to the man : Stretch forth thy hand . And he stretched it forth : and his hand was restored .
DRA	Luke	6	11	And they were filled with madness ; and they talked one with another , what they might do to Jesus .
DRA	Luke	6	12	And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God .
DRA	Luke	6	13	And when day was come , he called unto him his disciples ; and he chose twelve of them ( whom also he named apostles ) :
DRA	Luke	6	14	Simon , whom he surnamed Peter , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
DRA	Luke	6	15	Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alpheus , and Simon who is called Zelotes ,
DRA	Luke	6	16	And Jude , the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , who was the traitor .
DRA	Luke	6	17	And coming down with them , he stood in a plain place , and the company of his disciples , and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem , and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon ,
DRA	Luke	6	18	Who were come to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases . And they that were troubled with unclean spirits , were cured .
DRA	Luke	6	19	And all the multitude sought to touch him , for virtue went out from him , and healed all .
DRA	Luke	6	20	And he , lifting up his eyes on his disciples , said : Blessed are ye poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	6	21	Blessed are ye that hunger now : for you shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for you shall laugh .
DRA	Luke	6	22	Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man 's sake .
DRA	Luke	6	23	Be glad in that day and rejoice ; for behold , your reward is great in heaven . For according to these things did their fathers to the prophets .
DRA	Luke	6	24	But woe to you that are rich : for you have your consolation .
DRA	Luke	6	25	Woe to you that are filled : for you shall hunger . Woe to you that now laugh : for you shall mourn and weep .
DRA	Luke	6	26	Woe to you when men shall bless you : for according to these things did their fathers to the false prophets .
DRA	Luke	6	27	But I say to you that hear : Love your enemies , do good to them that hate you .
DRA	Luke	6	28	Bless them that curse you , and pray for them that calumniate you .
DRA	Luke	6	29	And to him that striketh thee on the one cheek , offer also the other . And him that taketh away from thee thy cloak , forbid not to take thy coat also .
DRA	Luke	6	30	Give to every one that asketh thee , and of him that taketh away thy goods , ask them not again .
DRA	Luke	6	31	And as you would that men should do to you , do you also to them in like manner .
DRA	Luke	6	32	And if you love them that love you , what thanks are to you ? for sinners also love those that love them .
DRA	Luke	6	33	And if you do good to them who do good to you , what thanks are to you ? for sinners also do this .
DRA	Luke	6	34	And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive , what thanks are to you ? for sinners also lend to sinners , for to receive as much .
DRA	Luke	6	35	But love ye your enemies : do good , and lend , hoping for nothing thereby : and your reward shall be great , and you shall be the sons of the Highest ; for he is kind to the unthankful , and to the evil .
DRA	Luke	6	36	Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
DRA	Luke	6	37	Judge not , and you shall not be judged . Condemn not , and you shall not be condemned . Forgive , and you shall be forgiven .
DRA	Luke	6	38	Give , and it shall be given to you : good measure and pressed down and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom . For with the same measure that you shall mete withal , it shall be measured to you again .
DRA	Luke	6	39	And he spoke also to them a similitude : Can the blind lead the blind ? do they not both fall into the ditch ?
DRA	Luke	6	40	The disciple is not above his master : but every one shall be perfect , if he be as his master .
DRA	Luke	6	41	And why seest thou the mote in thy brother 's eye : but the beam that is in thy own eye thou considerest not ?
DRA	Luke	6	42	Or how canst thou say to thy brother : Brother , let me pull the mote out of thy eye , when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye ? Hypocrite , cast first the beam out of thy own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brother 's eye .
DRA	Luke	6	43	For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit ; nor an evil tree that bringeth forth good fruit .
DRA	Luke	6	44	For every tree is known by its fruit . For men do not gather figs from thorns ; nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape .
DRA	Luke	6	45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil . For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
DRA	Luke	6	46	And why call you me , Lord , Lord ; and do not the things which I say ?
DRA	Luke	6	47	Every one that cometh to me , and heareth my words , and doth them , I will shew you to whom he is like .
DRA	Luke	6	48	He is like to a man building a house , who digged deep , and laid the foundation upon a rock . And when a flood came , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and it could not shake it ; for it was founded on a rock .
DRA	Luke	6	49	But he that heareth , and doth not , is like to a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation : against which the stream beat vehemently , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house was great . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	7	7	For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee ; but say the word , and my servant shall be healed .
DRA	Luke	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	7	2	And the servant of a certain centurion , who was dear to him , being sick , was ready to die .
DRA	Luke	7	3	And when he had heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the ancients of the Jews , desiring him to come and heal his servant .
DRA	Luke	7	4	And when they came to Jesus , they besought him earnestly , saying to him : He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him .
DRA	Luke	7	5	For he loveth our nation ; and he hath built us a synagogue .
DRA	Luke	7	6	And Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent his friends to him , saying : Lord , trouble not thyself ; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof .
DRA	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man subject to authority , having under me soldiers : and I say to one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doth it .
DRA	Luke	7	9	Which Jesus hearing , marvelled : and turning about to the multitude that followed him , he said : Amen I say to you , I have not found so great faith , not even in Israel .
DRA	Luke	7	10	And they who were sent , being returned to the house , found the servant whole who had been sick .
DRA	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass afterwards , that he went into a city that is called Naim ; and there went with him his disciples , and a great multitude .
DRA	Luke	7	12	And when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold a dead man was carried out , the only son of his mother ; and she was a widow : and a great multitude of the city was with her .
DRA	Luke	7	13	Whom when the Lord had seen , being moved with mercy towards her , he said to her : Weep not .
DRA	Luke	7	14	And he came near and touched the bier . And they that carried it , stood still . And he said : Young man , I say to thee , arise .
DRA	Luke	7	15	And he that was dead , sat up , and began to speak . And he gave him to his mother .
DRA	Luke	7	16	And there came a fear on them all : and they glorified God , saying : A great prophet is risen up among us : and , God hath visited his people .
DRA	Luke	7	17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea , and throughout all the country round about .
DRA	Luke	7	18	And John 's disciples told him of all these things .
DRA	Luke	7	19	And John called to him two of his disciples , and sent them to Jesus , saying : Art thou he that art to come ; or look we for another ?
DRA	Luke	7	20	And when the men were come unto him , they said : John the Baptist hath sent us to thee , saying : Art thou he that art to come ; or look we for another ?
DRA	Luke	7	21	( And in that same hour , he cured many of their diseases , and hurts , and evil spirits : and to many that were blind he gave sight . )
DRA	Luke	7	22	And answering , he said to them : Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen : the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are made clean , the deaf hear , the dead rise again , to the poor the gospel is preached :
DRA	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me .
DRA	Luke	7	24	And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John . What went ye out into the desert to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ?
DRA	Luke	7	25	But what went you out to see ? a man clothed in soft garments ? Behold they that are in costly apparel and live delicately , are in the houses of kings .
DRA	Luke	7	26	But what went you out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and more than a prophet .
DRA	Luke	7	27	This is he of whom it is written : Behold I send my angel before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee .
DRA	Luke	7	28	For I say to you : Amongst those that are born of women , there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist . But he that is the lesser in the kingdom of God , is greater than he .
DRA	Luke	7	29	And all the people hearing , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with John 's baptism .
DRA	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized by him .
DRA	Luke	7	31	And the Lord said : Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
DRA	Luke	7	32	They are like to children sitting in the marketplace , and speaking one to another , and saying : We have piped to you , and you have not danced : we have mourned , and you have not wept .
DRA	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and you say : He hath a devil .
DRA	Luke	7	34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking : and you say : Behold a man that is a glutton and a drinker of wine , a friend of publicans and sinners .
DRA	Luke	7	35	And wisdom is justified by all her children .
DRA	Luke	7	36	And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him . And he went into the house of the Pharisee , and sat down to meat .
DRA	Luke	7	37	And behold a woman that was in the city , a sinner , when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ;
DRA	Luke	7	38	And standing behind at his feet , she began to wash his feet , with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
DRA	Luke	7	39	And the Pharisee , who had invited him , seeing it , spoke within himself , saying : This man , if he were a prophet , would know surely who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him , that she is a sinner .
DRA	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering , said to him : Simon , I have somewhat to say to thee . But he said : Master , say it .
DRA	Luke	7	41	A certain creditor had two debtors , the one who owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
DRA	Luke	7	42	And whereas they had not wherewith to pay , he forgave them both . Which therefore of the two loveth him most ?
DRA	Luke	7	43	Simon answering , said : I suppose that he to whom he forgave most . And he said to him : Thou hast judged rightly .
DRA	Luke	7	44	And turning to the woman , he said unto Simon : Dost thou see this woman ? I entered into thy house , thou gavest me no water for my feet ; but she with tears hath washed my feet , and with her hairs hath wiped them .
DRA	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest me no kiss ; but she , since she came in , hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
DRA	Luke	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint ; but she with ointment hath anointed my feet .
DRA	Luke	7	47	Wherefore I say to thee : Many sins are forgiven her , because she hath loved much . But to whom less is forgiven , he loveth less .
DRA	Luke	7	48	And he said to her : Thy sins are forgiven thee .
DRA	Luke	7	49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves : Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
DRA	Luke	7	50	And he said to the woman : Thy faith hath made thee safe , go in peace . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Luke	8	2	And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities ; Mary who is called Magdalen , out of whom seven devils were gone forth ,
DRA	Luke	8	3	And Joanna the wife of Chusa , Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others who ministered unto him of their substance .
DRA	Luke	8	4	And when a very great multitude was gathered together , and hastened out of the cities unto him , he spoke by a similitude .
DRA	Luke	8	5	The sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
DRA	Luke	8	6	And other some fell upon a rock : and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it had no moisture .
DRA	Luke	8	7	And other some fell among thorns , and the thorns growing up with it , choked it .
DRA	Luke	8	9	And his disciples asked him what this parable might be .
DRA	Luke	8	10	To whom he said : To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God ; but to the rest in parables , that seeing they may not see , and hearing may not understand .
DRA	Luke	8	11	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
DRA	Luke	8	12	And they by the way side are they that hear ; then the devil cometh , and taketh the word out of their heart , lest believing they should be saved .
DRA	Luke	8	13	Now they upon the rock , are they who when they hear , receive the word with joy : and these have no roots ; for they believe for a while , and in time of temptation , they fall away .
DRA	Luke	8	14	And that which fell among thorns , are they who have heard , and going their way , are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and yield no fruit .
DRA	Luke	8	15	But that on the good ground , are they who in a good and perfect heart , hearing the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit in patience .
DRA	Luke	8	16	Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it upon a candlestick , that they who come in may see the light .
DRA	Luke	8	17	For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest , nor hidden , that shall not be known and come abroad .
DRA	Luke	8	18	Take heed therefore how you hear . For whosoever hath , to him shall be given : and whosoever hath not , that also which he thinketh he hath , shall be taken away from him .
DRA	Luke	8	19	And his mother and brethren came unto him ; and they could not come at him for the crowd .
DRA	Luke	8	20	And it was told him : Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
DRA	Luke	8	21	Who answering , said to them : My mother and my brethren are they who hear the word of God , and do it .
DRA	Luke	8	22	And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little ship with his disciples , and he said to them : Let us go over to the other side of the lake . And they launched forth .
DRA	Luke	8	23	And when they were sailing , he slept ; and there came down a storm of wind upon the lake , and they were filled , and were in danger .
DRA	Luke	8	24	And they came and awaked him , saying : Master , we perish . But he arising , rebuked the wind and the rage of the water ; and it ceased , and there was a calm .

DRA	Luke	8	28	And when he saw Jesus , he fell down before him ; and crying out with a loud voice , he said : What have I to do with thee , Jesus , Son of the most high God ? I beseech thee , do not torment me .
DRA	Luke	8	29	For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man . For many times it seized him , and he was bound with chains , and kept in fetters ; and breaking the bonds , he was driven by the devil into the deserts .
DRA	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , saying : What is thy name ? But he said : Legion ; because many devils were entered into him .
DRA	Luke	8	31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss .
DRA	Luke	8	32	And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain ; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them .
DRA	Luke	8	33	The devils therefore went out of the man , and entered into the swine ; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were stifled .
DRA	Luke	8	34	Which when they that fed them saw done , they fled away , and told it in the city and in the villages .
DRA	Luke	8	35	And they went out to see what was done ; and they came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at his feet , clothed , and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
DRA	Luke	8	36	And they also that had seen , told them how he had been healed from the legion .
DRA	Luke	8	37	And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear . And he , going up into the ship , returned back again .
DRA	Luke	8	38	Now the man , out of whom the devils were departed , besought him that he might be with him . But Jesus sent him away , saying :
DRA	Luke	8	39	Return to thy house , and tell how great things God hath done to thee . And he went through the whole city , publishing how great things Jesus had done to him .

DRA	Luke	8	41	And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at the feet of Jesus , beseeching him that he would come into his house :
DRA	Luke	8	42	For he had an only daughter , almost twelve years old , and she was dying . And it happened as he went , that he was thronged by the multitudes .
DRA	Luke	8	43	And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years , who had bestowed all her substance on physicians , and could not be healed by any .
DRA	Luke	8	44	She came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment ; and immediately the issue of her blood stopped .
DRA	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said : Who is it that touched me ? And all denying , Peter and they that were with him said : Master , the multitudes throng and press thee , and dost thou say , Who touched me ?
DRA	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said : Somebody hath touched me ; for I know that virtue is gone out from me .
DRA	Luke	8	47	And the woman seeing that she was not hid , came trembling , and fell down before his feet , and declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was immediately healed .
DRA	Luke	8	48	But he said to her : Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go thy way in peace .
DRA	Luke	8	49	As he was yet speaking , there cometh one to the ruler of the synagogue , saying to him : Thy daughter is dead , trouble him not .
DRA	Luke	8	50	And Jesus hearing this word , answered the father of the maid : Fear not ; believe only , and she shall be safe .
DRA	Luke	8	51	And when he was come to the house , he suffered not any man to go in with him , but Peter and James and John , and the father and mother of the maiden .
DRA	Luke	8	52	And all wept and mourned for her . But he said : Weep not ; the maid is not dead , but sleepeth .
DRA	Luke	8	53	And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
DRA	Luke	8	54	But he taking her by the hand , cried out , saying : Maid , arise .
DRA	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned , and she arose immediately . And he bid them give her to eat .
DRA	Luke	8	56	And her parents were astonished , whom he charged to tell no man what was done . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	9	9	And Herod said : John I have beheaded ; but who is this of whom I hear such things ? And he sought to see him .
DRA	Luke	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	9	2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
DRA	Luke	9	3	And he said to them : Take nothing for your journey ; neither staff , nor scrip , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats .
DRA	Luke	9	4	And whatsoever house you shall enter into , abide there , and depart not from thence .
DRA	Luke	9	5	And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off even the dust of your feet , for a testimony against them .
DRA	Luke	9	6	And going out , they went about through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing everywhere .
DRA	Luke	9	7	Now Herod , the tetrarch , heard of all things that were done by him ; and he was in a doubt , because it was said
DRA	Luke	9	8	By some , that John was risen from the dead : but by other some , that Elias had appeared ; and by others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
DRA	Luke	9	10	And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all they had done . And taking them , he went aside into a desert place , apart , which belongeth to Bethsaida .
DRA	Luke	9	11	Which when the people knew , they followed him ; and he received them , and spoke to them of the kingdom of God , and healed them who had need of healing .
DRA	Luke	9	12	Now the day began to decline . And the twelve came and said to him : Send away the multitude , that going into the towns and villages round about , they may lodge and get victuals ; for we are here in a desert place .
DRA	Luke	9	13	But he said to them : Give you them to eat . And they said : We have no more than five loaves and two fishes ; unless perhaps we should go and buy food for all this multitude .
DRA	Luke	9	14	Now there were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples : Make them sit down by fifties in a company .
DRA	Luke	9	15	And they did so ; and made them all sit down .
DRA	Luke	9	16	And taking the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed them ; and he broke , and distributed to his disciples , to set before the multitude .
DRA	Luke	9	17	And they did all eat , and were filled . And there were taken up of fragments that remained to them , twelve baskets .
DRA	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples also were with him : and he asked them , saying : Whom do the people say that I am ?
DRA	Luke	9	19	But they answered , and said : John the Baptist ; but some say Elias ; and others say that one of the former prophets is risen again .
DRA	Luke	9	20	And he said to them : But whom do you say that I am ? Simon Peter answering , said : The Christ of God .
DRA	Luke	9	21	But he strictly charging them , commanded they should tell this to no man .
DRA	Luke	9	22	Saying : The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the ancients and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day rise again .
DRA	Luke	9	23	And he said to all : If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
DRA	Luke	9	24	For whosoever will save his life , shall lose it ; for he that shall lose his life for my sake , shall save it .
DRA	Luke	9	25	For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , and cast away himself ?
DRA	Luke	9	26	For he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him the Son of man shall be ashamed , when he shall come in his majesty , and that of his Father , and of the holy angels .
DRA	Luke	9	27	But I tell you of a truth : There are some standing here that shall not taste death , till they see the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass about eight days after these words , that he took Peter , and James , and John , and went up into a mountain to pray .
DRA	Luke	9	29	And whilst he prayed , the shape of his countenance was altered , and his raiment became white and glittering .
DRA	Luke	9	30	And behold two men were talking with him . And they were Moses and Elias ,
DRA	Luke	9	31	Appearing in majesty . And they spoke of his decease that he should accomplish in Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	9	32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep . And waking , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
DRA	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass , that as they were departing from him , Peter saith to Jesus : Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias ; not knowing what he said .
DRA	Luke	9	34	And as he spoke these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them ; and they were afraid , when they entered into the cloud .
DRA	Luke	9	35	And a voice came out of the cloud , saying : This is my beloved Son ; hear him .
DRA	Luke	9	36	And whilst the voice was uttered , Jesus was found alone . And they held their peace , and told no man in those days any of these things which they had seen .
DRA	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass the day following , when they came down from the mountain , there met him a great multitude .
DRA	Luke	9	38	And behold a man among the crowd cried out , saying : Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son , because he is my only one .
DRA	Luke	9	39	And lo , a spirit seizeth him , and he suddenly crieth out , and he throweth him down and teareth him , so that he foameth ; and bruising him , he hardly departeth from him .
DRA	Luke	9	40	And I desired thy disciples to cast him out , and they could not .
DRA	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answering , said : O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring hither thy son .
DRA	Luke	9	42	And as he was coming to him , the devil threw him down , and tore him .
DRA	Luke	9	43	And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and cured the boy , and restored him to his father .
DRA	Luke	9	44	And all were astonished at the mighty power of God . But while all wondered at all the things he did , he said to his disciples : Lay you up in your hearts these words , for it shall come to pass , that the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
DRA	Luke	9	45	But they understood not this word ; and it was hid from them , so that they perceived it not . And they were afraid to ask him concerning this word .
DRA	Luke	9	46	And there entered a thought into them , which of them should be greater .
DRA	Luke	9	47	But Jesus seeing the thoughts of their heart , took a child and set him by him ,
DRA	Luke	9	48	And said to them : Whosoever shall receive this child in my name , receiveth me ; and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth him that sent me . For he that is the lesser among you all , he is the greater .
DRA	Luke	9	49	And John , answering , said : Master , we saw a certain man casting out devils in thy name , and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us .
DRA	Luke	9	50	And Jesus said to him : Forbid him not ; for he that is not against you , is for you .
DRA	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass , when the days of his assumption were accomplishing , that he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	9	52	And he sent messengers before his face ; and going , they entered into a city of the Samaritans , to prepare for him .
DRA	Luke	9	53	And they received him not , because his face was of one going to Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	9	54	And when his disciples James and John had seen this , they said : Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them ?
DRA	Luke	9	55	And turning , he rebuked them , saying : You know not of what spirit you are .
DRA	Luke	9	56	The Son of man came not to destroy souls , but to save . And they went into another town .
DRA	Luke	9	57	And it came to pass , as they walked in the way , that a certain man said to him : I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
DRA	Luke	9	58	Jesus said to him : The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
DRA	Luke	9	59	But he said to another : Follow me . And he said : Lord , suffer me first to go , and to bury my father .
DRA	Luke	9	60	And Jesus said to him : Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou , and preach the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	9	61	And another said : I will follow thee , Lord ; but let me first take my leave of them that are at my house .
DRA	Luke	9	62	Jesus said to him : No man putting his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	10	10	But into whatsoever city you enter , and they receive you not , going forth into the streets thereof , say :
DRA	Luke	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	10	2	And he said to them : The harvest indeed is great , but the labourers are few . Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send labourers into his harvest .
DRA	Luke	10	3	Go : Behold I send you as lambs among wolves .
DRA	Luke	10	4	Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes ; and salute no man by the way .
DRA	Luke	10	5	Into whatsoever house you enter , first say : Peace be to this house .
DRA	Luke	10	6	And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon him ; but if not , it shall return to you .
DRA	Luke	10	7	And in the same house , remain , eating and drinking such things as they have : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Remove not from house to house .
DRA	Luke	10	8	And into what city soever you enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you .
DRA	Luke	10	9	And heal the sick that are therein , and say to them : The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
DRA	Luke	10	11	Even the very dust of your city that cleaveth to us , we wipe off against you . Yet know this , that the kingdom of God is at hand .
DRA	Luke	10	12	I say to you , it shall be more tolerable at that day for Sodom , than for that city .
DRA	Luke	10	13	Woe to thee , Corozain , woe to thee , Bethsaida . For if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the mighty works that have been wrought in you , they would have done penance long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
DRA	Luke	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgement , than for you .
DRA	Luke	10	15	And thou , Capharnaum , which art exalted unto heaven , thou shalt be thrust down to hell .
DRA	Luke	10	16	He that heareth you , heareth me ; and he that despiseth you , despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me , despiseth him that sent me .
DRA	Luke	10	17	And the seventy-two returned with joy , saying : Lord , the devils also are subject to us in thy name .
DRA	Luke	10	18	And he said to them : I saw Satan like lightning falling from heaven .
DRA	Luke	10	19	Behold , I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and upon all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall hurt you .
DRA	Luke	10	20	But yet rejoice not in this , that spirits are subject unto you ; but rejoice in this , that your names are written in heaven .
DRA	Luke	10	21	In that same hour , he rejoiced in the Holy Ghost , and said : I confess to thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to little ones . Yea , Father , for so it hath seemed good in thy sight .
DRA	Luke	10	22	All things are delivered to me by my Father ; and no one knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and to whom the Son will reveal him .
DRA	Luke	10	23	And turning to his disciples , he said : Blessed are the eyes that see the things which you see .
DRA	Luke	10	24	For I say to you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things that you see , and have not seen them ; and to hear the things that you hear , and have not heard them .
DRA	Luke	10	25	And behold a certain lawyer stood up , tempting him , and saying , Master , what must I do to possess eternal life ?
DRA	Luke	10	26	But he said to him : What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
DRA	Luke	10	27	He answering , said : Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind : and thy neighbour as thyself .
DRA	Luke	10	28	And he said to him : Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
DRA	Luke	10	29	But he willing to justify himself , said to Jesus : And who is my neighbour ?
DRA	Luke	10	30	And Jesus answering , said : A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among robbers , who also stripped him , and having wounded him went away , leaving him half dead .
DRA	Luke	10	31	And it chanced , that a certain priest went down the same way : and seeing him , passed by .
DRA	Luke	10	32	In like manner also a Levite , when he was near the place and saw him , passed by .
DRA	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan being on his journey , came near him ; and seeing him , was moved with compassion .
DRA	Luke	10	34	And going up to him , bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine : and setting him upon his own beast , brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
DRA	Luke	10	35	And the next day he took out two pence , and gave to the host , and said : Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above , I , at my return , will repay thee .
DRA	Luke	10	36	Which of these three , in thy opinion , was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers ?
DRA	Luke	10	37	But he said : He that shewed mercy to him . And Jesus said to him : Go , and do thou in like manner .
DRA	Luke	10	38	Now it came to pass as they went , that he entered into a certain town : and a certain woman named Martha , received him into her house .
DRA	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , who sitting also at the Lord 's feet , heard his word .
DRA	Luke	10	40	But Martha was busy about much serving . Who stood and said : Lord , hast thou no care that my sister hath left me alone to serve ? speak to her therefore , that she help me .
DRA	Luke	10	41	And the Lord answering , said to her : Martha , Martha , thou art careful , and art troubled about many things :
DRA	Luke	10	42	But one thing is necessary . Mary hath chosen the best part , which shall not be taken away from her . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	11	11	And which of you , if he ask his father bread , will he give him a stone ? or a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
DRA	Luke	11	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	11	2	And he said to them : When you pray , say : Father , hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come .
DRA	Luke	11	3	Give us this day our daily bread .
DRA	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins , for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation .
DRA	Luke	11	5	And he said to them : Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go to him at midnight , and shall say to him : Friend , lend me three loaves ,
DRA	Luke	11	6	Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me , and I have not what to set before him .
DRA	Luke	11	7	And he from within should answer , and say : Trouble me not , the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee .
DRA	Luke	11	8	Yet if he shall continue knocking , I say to you , although he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend ; yet , because of his importunity , he will rise , and give him as many as he needeth .
DRA	Luke	11	9	And I say to you , Ask , and it shall be given you : seek , and you shall find : knock , and it shall be opened to you .
DRA	Luke	11	10	For every one that asketh , receiveth ; and he that seeketh , findeth ; and to him that knocketh , it shall be opened .
DRA	Luke	11	12	Or if he shall ask an egg , will he reach him a scorpion ?
DRA	Luke	11	13	If you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him ?
DRA	Luke	11	14	And he was casting out a devil , and the same was dumb : and when he had cast out the devil , the dumb spoke : and the multitudes were in admiration at it :
DRA	Luke	11	15	But some of them said : He casteth out devils by Beelzebub , the prince of devils .
DRA	Luke	11	16	And others tempting , asked of him a sign from heaven .
DRA	Luke	11	17	But he seeing their thoughts , said to them : Every kingdom divided against itself , shall be brought to desolation , and house upon house shall fall .
DRA	Luke	11	18	And if Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because you say , that through Beelzebub I cast out devils .
DRA	Luke	11	19	Now if I cast out devils by Beelzebub ; by whom do your children cast them out ? Therefore they shall be your judges .
DRA	Luke	11	20	But if I by the finger of God cast out devils ; doubtless the kingdom of God is come upon you .
DRA	Luke	11	21	When a strong man armed keepeth his court , those things are in peace which he possesseth .
DRA	Luke	11	22	But if a stronger than he come upon him , and overcome him ; he will take away all his armour wherein he trusted , and will distribute his spoils .
DRA	Luke	11	23	He that is not with me , is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me , scattereth .
DRA	Luke	11	24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through places without water , seeking rest ; and not finding , he saith : I will return into my house whence I came out .
DRA	Luke	11	25	And when he is come , he findeth it swept and garnished .
DRA	Luke	11	26	Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and entering in they dwell there . And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first .
DRA	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass , as he spoke these things , a certain woman from the crowd , lifting up her voice , said to him : Blessed is the womb that bore thee , and the paps that gave thee suck .
DRA	Luke	11	28	But he said : Yea rather , blessed are they who hear the word of God , and keep it .
DRA	Luke	11	29	And the multitudes running together , he began to say : This generation is a wicked generation : it asketh a sign , and a sign shall not be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
DRA	Luke	11	30	For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninivites ; so shall the Son of man also be to this generation .
DRA	Luke	11	31	The queen of the south shall rise in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold more than Solomon here .
DRA	Luke	11	32	The men of Ninive shall rise in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it ; because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas ; and behold more than Jonas here .
DRA	Luke	11	33	No man lighteth a candle , and putteth it in a hidden place , nor under a bushel ; but upon a candlestick , that they that come in , may see the light .
DRA	Luke	11	34	The light of thy body is thy eye . If thy eye be single , thy whole body will be lightsome : but if it be evil , thy body also will be darksome .
DRA	Luke	11	35	Take heed therefore , that the light which is in thee , be not darkness .
DRA	Luke	11	36	If then thy whole body be lightsome , having no part of darkness ; the whole shall be lightsome ; and as a bright lamp , shall enlighten thee .
DRA	Luke	11	37	And as he was speaking , a certain Pharisee prayed him , that he would dine with him . And he going in , sat down to eat .
DRA	Luke	11	38	And the Pharisee began to say , thinking within himself , why he was not washed before dinner .
DRA	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said to him : Now you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter ; but your inside is full of rapine and iniquity .
DRA	Luke	11	40	Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without , make also that which is within ?
DRA	Luke	11	41	But yet that which remaineth , give alms ; and behold , all things are clean unto you .
DRA	Luke	11	42	But woe to you , Pharisees , because you tithe mint and rue and every herb ; and pass over judgment , and the charity of God . Now these things you ought to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
DRA	Luke	11	43	Woe to you , Pharisees , because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and salutations in the marketplace .
DRA	Luke	11	44	Woe to you , because you are as sepulchres that appear not , and men that walk over are not aware .
DRA	Luke	11	45	And one of the lawyers answering , saith to him : Master , in saying these things , thou reproachest us also .
DRA	Luke	11	46	But he said : Woe to you lawyers also , because you load men with burdens which they can not bear , and you yourselves touch not the packs with one of your fingers .
DRA	Luke	11	47	Woe to you who build the monuments of the prophets : and your fathers killed them .
DRA	Luke	11	48	Truly you bear witness that you consent to the doings of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and you build their sepulchres .
DRA	Luke	11	49	For this cause also the wisdom of God said : I will send to them prophets and apostles ; and some of them they will kill and persecute .
DRA	Luke	11	50	That the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ,
DRA	Luke	11	51	From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , who was slain between the alter and the temple : Yea I say to you , It shall be required of this generation .
DRA	Luke	11	52	Woe to you lawyers , for you have taken away the key of knowledge : you yourselves have not entered in , and those that were entering in , you have hindered .
DRA	Luke	11	53	And as he was saying these things to them , the Pharisees and the lawyers began violently to urge him , and to oppress his mouth about many things ,
DRA	Luke	11	54	Lying in wait for him , and seeking to catch something from his mouth , that they might accuse him . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	12	12	For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you must say .
DRA	Luke	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	12	2	For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed : nor hidden , that shall not be known .
DRA	Luke	12	3	For whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness , shall be published in the light : and that which you have spoken in the ear in the chambers , shall be preached on the housetops .
DRA	Luke	12	4	And I say to you , my friends : Be not afraid of them who kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
DRA	Luke	12	5	But I will shew you whom you shall fear : fear ye him , who after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell . Yea , I say to you , fear him .
DRA	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ?
DRA	Luke	12	7	Yea , the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : you are of more value than many sparrows .
DRA	Luke	12	8	And I say to you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God .
DRA	Luke	12	9	But he that shall deny me before men , shall be denied before the angels of God .
DRA	Luke	12	10	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but to him that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven .
DRA	Luke	12	11	And when they shall bring you into the synagogues , and to magistrates and powers , be not solicitous how or what you shall answer , or what you shall say ;
DRA	Luke	12	13	And one of the multitude said to him : Master , speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me .
DRA	Luke	12	14	But he said to him : Man , who hath appointed me judge , or divider , over you ?
DRA	Luke	12	15	And he said to them : Take heed and beware of all covetousness ; for a man 's life doth not consist in the abundance of things which he possesseth .
DRA	Luke	12	16	And he spoke a similitude to them , saying : The land of a certain rich man brought forth plenty of fruits .
DRA	Luke	12	17	And he thought within himself , saying : What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
DRA	Luke	12	18	And he said : This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and will build greater ; and into them will I gather all things that are grown to me , and my goods .
DRA	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul : Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thy rest ; eat , drink , make good cheer .
DRA	Luke	12	20	But God said to him : Thou fool , this night do they require thy soul of thee : and whose shall those things be which thou hast provided ?
DRA	Luke	12	21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich towards God .
DRA	Luke	12	22	And he said to his disciples : Therefore I say to you , be not solicitous for your life , what you shall eat ; nor for your body , what you shall put on .
DRA	Luke	12	23	The life is more than the meat , and the body is more than the raiment .
DRA	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens , for they sow not , neither do they reap , neither have they storehouse nor barn , and God feedeth them . How much are you more valuable than they ?
DRA	Luke	12	25	And which of you , by taking thought , can add to his stature one cubit ?
DRA	Luke	12	26	If then ye be not able to do so much as the least thing , why are you solicitous for the rest ?
DRA	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they labour not , neither do they spin . But I say to you , not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these .
DRA	Luke	12	28	Now if God clothe in this manner the grass that is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more you , O ye of little faith ?
DRA	Luke	12	29	And seek not you what you shall eat , or what you shall drink : and be not lifted up on high .
DRA	Luke	12	30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek . But your Father knoweth that you have need of these things .
DRA	Luke	12	31	But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his justice , and all these things shall be added unto you .
DRA	Luke	12	32	Fear not , little flock , for it hath pleased your Father to give you a kingdom .
DRA	Luke	12	33	Sell what you possess and give alms . Make to yourselves bags which grow not old , a treasure in heaven which faileth not : where no thief approacheth , nor moth corrupteth .
DRA	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
DRA	Luke	12	35	Let your loins be girt , and lamps burning in your hands .
DRA	Luke	12	36	And you yourselves like to men who wait for their lord , when he shall return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open to him immediately .
DRA	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants , whom the Lord when he cometh , shall find watching . Amen I say to you , that he will gird himself , and make them sit down to meat , and passing will minister unto them .
DRA	Luke	12	38	And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
DRA	Luke	12	39	But this know ye , that if the householder did know at what hour the thief would come , he would surely watch , and would not suffer his house to be broken open .
DRA	Luke	12	40	Be you then also ready : for at what hour you think not , the Son of man will come .
DRA	Luke	12	41	And Peter said to him : Lord , dost thou speak this parable to us , or likewise to all ?
DRA	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said : Who ( thinkest thou ) is the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord setteth over his family , to give them their measure of wheat in due season ?
DRA	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant , whom when his lord shall come , he shall find so doing .
DRA	Luke	12	44	Verily I say to you , he will set him over all that he possesseth .
DRA	Luke	12	45	But if that servant shall say in his heart : My lord is long a coming ; and shall begin to strike the menservants and maidservants , and to eat and to drink and be drunk :
DRA	Luke	12	46	The lord of that servant will come in the day that he hopeth not , and at the hour that he knoweth not , and shall separate him , and shall appoint him his portion with unbelievers .
DRA	Luke	12	47	And that servant who knew the will of his lord , and prepared not himself , and did not according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
DRA	Luke	12	48	But he that knew not , and did things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . And unto whomsoever much is given , of him much shall be required : and to whom they have committed much , of him they will demand the more .
DRA	Luke	12	49	I am come to cast fire on the earth ; and what will I , but that it be kindled ?
DRA	Luke	12	50	And I have a baptism wherewith I am to be baptized : and how am I straitened until it be accomplished ?
DRA	Luke	12	51	Think ye , that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , no ; but separation .
DRA	Luke	12	52	For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided : three against two , and two against three .
DRA	Luke	12	53	The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against his father , the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother , the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
DRA	Luke	12	54	And he said also to the multitudes : When you see a cloud rising from the west , presently you say : A shower is coming : and so it happeneth :
DRA	Luke	12	55	And when ye see the south wind blow , you say : There will be heat : and it cometh to pass .
DRA	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites , you know how to discern the face of the heaven and of the earth : but how is it that you do not discern this time ?
DRA	Luke	12	57	And why even of yourselves , do you not judge that which is just ?
DRA	Luke	12	58	And when thou goest with thy adversary to the prince , whilst thou art in the way , endeavour to be delivered from him : lest perhaps he draw thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the exacter , and the exacter cast thee into prison .
DRA	Luke	12	59	I say to thee , thou shalt not go out thence , until thou pay the very last mite . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Luke	13	2	And he answering , said to them : Think you that these Galileans were sinners above all the men of Galilee , because they suffered such things ?
DRA	Luke	13	3	No , I say to you : but unless you shall do penance , you shall all likewise perish .
DRA	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe , and slew them : think you , that they also were debtors above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
DRA	Luke	13	5	No , I say to you ; but except you do penance , you shall all likewise perish .
DRA	Luke	13	6	He spoke also this parable : A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit on it , and found none .
DRA	Luke	13	7	And he said to the dresser of the vineyard : Behold , for these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and I find none . Cut it done therefore : why cumbereth it the ground ?
DRA	Luke	13	8	But he answering , said to him : Lord , let it alone this year also , until I dig about it , and dung it .
DRA	Luke	13	9	And if happily it bear fruit : but if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down .
DRA	Luke	13	10	And he was teaching in their synagogue on their sabbath .
DRA	Luke	13	11	And behold there was a woman , who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years : and she was bowed together , neither could she look upwards at all .
DRA	Luke	13	12	Whom when Jesus saw , he called her unto him , and said to her : Woman , thou art delivered from thy infirmity .
DRA	Luke	13	14	And the ruler of the synagogue ( being angry that Jesus had healed on the sabbath ) answering , said to the multitude : Six days there are wherein you ought to work . In them therefore come , and be healed ; and not on the sabbath day .
DRA	Luke	13	15	And the Lord answering him , said : Ye hypocrites , doth not every one of you , on the sabbath day , loose his ox or his ass from the manger , and lead them to water ?
DRA	Luke	13	16	And ought not this daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
DRA	Luke	13	17	And when he said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the things that were gloriously done by him .
DRA	Luke	13	18	He said therefore : To what is the kingdom of God like , and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
DRA	Luke	13	19	It is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took and cast into his garden , and it grew and became a great tree , and the birds of the air lodged in the branches thereof .
DRA	Luke	13	20	And again he said : Whereunto shall I esteem the kingdom of God to be like ?
DRA	Luke	13	21	It is like to leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
DRA	Luke	13	22	And he went through the cities and towns teaching , and making his journey to Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	13	23	And a certain man said to him : Lord , are they few that are saved ? But he said to them :
DRA	Luke	13	24	Strive to enter by the narrow gate ; for many , I say to you , shall seek to enter , and shall not be able .
DRA	Luke	13	25	But when the master of the house shall be gone in , and shall shut the door , you shall begin to stand without , and knock at the door , saying : Lord , open to us . And he answering , shall say to you : I know you not , whence you are .
DRA	Luke	13	26	Then you shall begin to say : We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
DRA	Luke	13	27	And he shall say to you : I know you not , whence you are : depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
DRA	Luke	13	28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
DRA	Luke	13	29	And there shall come from the east and the west , and the north and the south ; and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	13	30	And behold , they are last that shall be first ; and they are first that shall be last .
DRA	Luke	13	31	The same day , there came some of the Pharisees , saying to him : Depart , and get thee hence , for Herod hath a mind to kill thee .
DRA	Luke	13	32	And he said to them : Go and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I am consummated .
DRA	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must walk to day and to morrow , and the day following , because it can not be that a prophet perish , out of Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	13	34	Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent to thee , how often would I have gathered thy children as the bird doth her brood under her wings , and thou wouldest not ?
DRA	Luke	13	35	Behold your house shall be left to you desolate . And I say to you , that you shall not see me till the time come , when you shall say : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Luke	14	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	14	2	And behold , there was a certain man before him that had the dropsy .
DRA	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answering , spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying : Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
DRA	Luke	14	4	But they held their peace . But he taking him , healed him , and sent him away .
DRA	Luke	14	5	And answering them , he said : Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit , and will not immediately draw him out , on the sabbath day ?
DRA	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer him to these things .
DRA	Luke	14	7	And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited , marking how they chose the first seats at the table , saying to them :
DRA	Luke	14	8	When thou art invited to a wedding , sit not down in the first place , lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him :
DRA	Luke	14	9	And he that invited thee and him , come and say to thee , Give this man place : and then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place .
DRA	Luke	14	10	But when thou art invited , go , sit down in the lowest place ; that when he who invited thee , cometh , he may say to thee : Friend , go up higher . Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee .
DRA	Luke	14	11	Because every one that exalteth himself , shall be humbled ; and he that humbleth himself , shall be exalted .
DRA	Luke	14	12	And he said to him also that had invited him : When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kinsmen , nor thy neighbours who are rich ; lest perhaps they also invite thee again , and a recompense be made to thee .
DRA	Luke	14	13	But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , and the blind ;
DRA	Luke	14	15	When one of them that sat at table with him , had heard these things , he said to him : Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	14	16	But he said to him : A certain man made a great supper , and invited many .
DRA	Luke	14	17	And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited , that they should come , for now all things are ready .
DRA	Luke	14	18	And they began all at once to make excuse . The first said to him : I have bought a farm , and I must needs go out and see it : I pray thee , hold me excused .
DRA	Luke	14	19	And another said : I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to try them : I pray thee , hold me excused .
DRA	Luke	14	20	And another said : I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come .
DRA	Luke	14	21	And the servant returning , told these things to his lord . Then the master of the house , being angry , said to his servant : Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the feeble , and the blind , and the lame .
DRA	Luke	14	22	And the servant said : Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
DRA	Luke	14	23	And the Lord said to the servant : Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
DRA	Luke	14	24	But I say unto you , that none of those men that were invited , shall taste of my supper .
DRA	Luke	14	25	And there went great multitudes with him . And turning , he said to them :
DRA	Luke	14	26	If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea and his own life also , he can not be my disciple .
DRA	Luke	14	27	And whosoever doth not carry his cross and come after me , can not be my disciple .
DRA	Luke	14	28	For which of you having a mind to build a tower , doth not first sit down , and reckon the charges that are necessary , whether he have wherewithal to finish it :
DRA	Luke	14	29	Lest , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that see it begin to mock him ,
DRA	Luke	14	30	Saying : This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
DRA	Luke	14	31	Or what king , about to go to make war against another king , doth not first sit down , and think whether he be able , with ten thousand , to meet him that , with twenty thousand , cometh against him ?
DRA	Luke	14	32	Or else , whilst the other is yet afar off , sending an embassy , he desireth conditions of peace .
DRA	Luke	14	33	So likewise every one of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth , can not be my disciple .
DRA	Luke	14	34	Salt is good . But if the salt shall lose its savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?

DRA	Luke	15	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying : This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
DRA	Luke	15	3	And he spoke to them this parable , saying :
DRA	Luke	15	4	What man of you that hath an hundred sheep : and if he shall lose one of them , doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert , and go after that which was lost , until he find it ?
DRA	Luke	15	5	And when he hath found it , lay it upon his shoulders , rejoicing :
DRA	Luke	15	6	And coming home , call together his friends and neighbours , saying to them : Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep that was lost ?
DRA	Luke	15	7	I say to you , that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance , more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance .
DRA	Luke	15	8	Or what woman having ten groats ; if she lose one groat , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently until she find it ?
DRA	Luke	15	9	And when she hath found it , call together her friends and neighbours , saying : Rejoice with me , because I have found the groat which I had lost .
DRA	Luke	15	10	So I say to you , there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance .
DRA	Luke	15	11	And he said : A certain man had two sons :
DRA	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father : Father , give me the portion of substance that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his substance .
DRA	Luke	15	13	And not many days after , the younger son , gathering all together , went abroad into a far country : and there wasted his substance , living riotously .
DRA	Luke	15	14	And after he had spent all , there came a mighty famine in that country ; and he began to be in want .
DRA	Luke	15	16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat ; and no man gave unto him .
DRA	Luke	15	17	And returning to himself , he said : How many hired servants in my father 's house abound with bread , and I here perish with hunger ?
DRA	Luke	15	18	I will arise , and will go to my father , and say to him : Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee :
DRA	Luke	15	19	I am not worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
DRA	Luke	15	20	And rising up he came to his father . And when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and running to him fell upon his neck , and kissed him .
DRA	Luke	15	21	And the son said to him : Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , I am not now worthy to be called thy son .
DRA	Luke	15	22	And the father said to his servants : Bring forth quickly the first robe , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
DRA	Luke	15	23	And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it , and let us eat and make merry :
DRA	Luke	15	24	Because this my son was dead , and is come to life again : was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry .
DRA	Luke	15	25	Now his elder son was in the field , and when he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing :
DRA	Luke	15	26	And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
DRA	Luke	15	27	And he said to him : Thy brother is come , and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe .
DRA	Luke	15	28	And he was angry , and would not go in . His father therefore coming out began to entreat him .
DRA	Luke	15	29	And he answering , said to his father : Behold , for so many years do I serve thee , and I have never transgressed thy commandment , and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends :
DRA	Luke	15	30	But as soon as this thy son is come , who hath devoured his substance with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
DRA	Luke	15	31	But he said to him : Son , thou art always with me , and all I have is thine .
DRA	Luke	15	32	But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad , for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again ; he was lost , and is found . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	16	16	The law and the prophets were until John ; from that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every one useth violence towards it .
DRA	Luke	16	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	16	2	And he called him , and said to him : How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship : for now thou canst be steward no longer .
DRA	Luke	16	3	And the steward said within himself : What shall I do , because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship ? To dig I am not able ; to beg I am ashamed .
DRA	Luke	16	4	I know what I will do , that when I shall be removed from the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
DRA	Luke	16	5	Therefore calling together every one of his lord 's debtors , he said to the first : How much dost thou owe my lord ?
DRA	Luke	16	6	But he said : An hundred barrels of oil . And he said to him : Take thy bill and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
DRA	Luke	16	7	Then he said to another : And how much dost thou owe ? Who said : An hundred quarters of wheat . He said to him : Take thy bill , and write eighty .
DRA	Luke	16	8	And the lord commended the unjust steward , forasmuch as he had done wisely : for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light .
DRA	Luke	16	9	And I say to you : Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity ; that when you shall fail , they may receive you into everlasting dwellings .
DRA	Luke	16	10	He that is faithful in that which is least , is faithful also in that which is greater : and he that is unjust in that which is little , is unjust also in that which is greater .
DRA	Luke	16	11	If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon ; who will trust you with that which is the true ?
DRA	Luke	16	12	And if you have not been faithful in that which is another 's ; who will give you that which is your own ?
DRA	Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or he will hold to the one , and despise the other . You can not serve God and mammon .
DRA	Luke	16	14	Now the Pharisees , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
DRA	Luke	16	15	And he said to them : You are they who justify yourselves before men , but God knoweth your hearts ; for that which is high to men , is an abomination before God .
DRA	Luke	16	17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fall .
DRA	Luke	16	18	Every one that putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband , committeth adultery .
DRA	Luke	16	19	There was a certain rich man , who was clothed in purple and fine linen ; and feasted sumptuously every day .
DRA	Luke	16	20	And there was a certain beggar , named Lazarus , who lay at his gate , full of sores ,
DRA	Luke	16	21	Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man 's table , and no one did give him ; moreover the dogs came , and licked his sores .
DRA	Luke	16	22	And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham 's bosom . And the rich man also died : and he was buried in hell .
DRA	Luke	16	23	And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments , he saw Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom :
DRA	Luke	16	24	And he cried , and said : Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , to cool my tongue : for I am tormented in this flame .
DRA	Luke	16	25	And Abraham said to him : Son , remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime , and likewise Lazareth evil things , but now he is comforted ; and thou art tormented .
DRA	Luke	16	26	And besides all this , between us and you , there is fixed a great chaos : so that they who would pass from hence to you , can not , nor from thence come hither .
DRA	Luke	16	27	And he said : Then , father , I beseech thee , that thou wouldst send him to my father 's house , for I have five brethren ,
DRA	Luke	16	28	That he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torments .
DRA	Luke	16	29	And Abraham said to him : They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
DRA	Luke	16	30	But he said : No , father Abraham : but if one went to them from the dead , they will do penance .
DRA	Luke	16	31	And he said to him : If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they believe , if one rise again from the dead . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Luke	17	2	It were better for him , that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should scandalize one of these little ones .
DRA	Luke	17	3	Take heed to yourselves . If thy brother sin against thee , reprove him : and if he do penance , forgive him .
DRA	Luke	17	4	And if he sin against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day be converted unto thee , saying , I repent ; forgive him .
DRA	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said to the Lord : Increase our faith .
DRA	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said : If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed , you might say to this mulberry tree , Be thou rooted up , and be thou transplanted into the sea : and it would obey you .
DRA	Luke	17	7	But which of you having a servant ploughing , or feeding cattle , will say to him , when he is come from the field : Immediately go , sit down to meat :
DRA	Luke	17	8	And will not rather say to him : Make ready my supper , and gird thyself , and serve me , whilst I eat and drink , and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink ?
DRA	Luke	17	9	Doth he thank that servant , for doing the things which he commanded him ?
DRA	Luke	17	10	I think not . So you also , when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you , say : We are unprofitable servants ; we have done that which we ought to do .
DRA	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass , as he was going to Jerusalem , he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
DRA	Luke	17	12	And as he entered into a certain town , there met him ten men that were lepers , who stood afar off ;
DRA	Luke	17	13	And lifted up their voice , saying : Jesus , master , have mercy on us .
DRA	Luke	17	14	Whom when he saw , he said : Go , shew yourselves to the priests . And it came to pass , as they went , they were made clean .
DRA	Luke	17	15	And one of them , when he saw that he was made clean , went back , with a loud voice glorifying God .
DRA	Luke	17	16	And he fell on his face before his feet , giving thanks : and this was a Samaritan .
DRA	Luke	17	18	There is no one found to return and give glory to God , but this stranger .
DRA	Luke	17	19	And he said to him : Arise , go thy way ; for thy faith hath made thee whole .
DRA	Luke	17	20	And being asked by the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come ? he answered them , and said : The kingdom of God cometh not with observation :
DRA	Luke	17	21	Neither shall they say : Behold here , or behold there . For lo , the kingdom of God is within you .
DRA	Luke	17	22	And he said to his disciples : The days will come , when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man ; and you shall not see it .
DRA	Luke	17	23	And they will say to you : See here , and see there . Go ye not after , nor follow them :
DRA	Luke	17	24	For as the lightning that lighteneth from under heaven , shineth unto the parts that are under heaven , so shall the Son of man be in his day .
DRA	Luke	17	25	But first he must suffer many things , and be rejected by this generation .
DRA	Luke	17	26	And as it came to pass in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
DRA	Luke	17	27	They did eat and drink , they married wives , and were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark : and the flood came and destroyed them all .
DRA	Luke	17	28	Likewise as it came to pass , in the days of Lot : they did eat and drink , they bought and sold , they planted and built .
DRA	Luke	17	29	And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom , it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
DRA	Luke	17	30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed .
DRA	Luke	17	31	In that hour , he that shall be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away : and he that shall be in the field , in like manner , let him not return back .
DRA	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot 's wife .
DRA	Luke	17	33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life , shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose it , shall preserve it .
DRA	Luke	17	34	I say to you : in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .

DRA	Luke	18	2	Saying : There was a judge in a certain city , who feared not God , nor regarded man .
DRA	Luke	18	3	And there was a certain widow in that city , and she came to him , saying : Avenge me of my adversary .
DRA	Luke	18	4	And he would not for a long time . But afterwards he said within himself : Although I fear not God , nor regard man ,
DRA	Luke	18	5	Yet because this widow is troublesome to me , I will avenge her , lest continually coming she weary me .
DRA	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said : Hear what the unjust judge saith .
DRA	Luke	18	7	And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night : and will he have patience in their regard ?
DRA	Luke	18	8	I say to you , that he will quickly revenge them . But yet the Son of man , when he cometh , shall he find , think you , faith on earth ?
DRA	Luke	18	9	And to some who trusted in themselves as just , and despised others , he spoke also this parable :
DRA	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray : the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
DRA	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee standing , prayed thus with himself : O God , I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , as also is this publican .
DRA	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in a week : I give tithes of all that I possess .
DRA	Luke	18	13	And the publican , standing afar off , would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven ; but struck his breast , saying : O God , be merciful to me a sinner .
DRA	Luke	18	14	I say to you , this man went down into his house justified rather than the other : because every one that exalteth himself , shall be humbled : and he that humbleth himself , shall be exalted .
DRA	Luke	18	15	And they brought unto him also infants , that he might touch them . Which when the disciples saw , they rebuked them .
DRA	Luke	18	16	But Jesus , calling them together , said : Suffer children to come to me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	18	17	Amen , I say to you : Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child , shall not enter into it .
DRA	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said to him : Why dost thou call me good ? None is good but God alone .
DRA	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments : Thou shalt not kill : Thou shalt not commit adultery : Thou shalt not steal : Thou shalt not bear false witness : Honour thy father and mother .
DRA	Luke	18	21	Who said : All these things have I kept from my youth .
DRA	Luke	18	22	Which when Jesus had heard , he said to him : Yet one thing is wanting to thee : sell all whatever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
DRA	Luke	18	23	He having heard these things , became sorrowful ; for he was very rich .
DRA	Luke	18	24	And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful , said : How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	18	26	And they that heard it , said : Who then can be saved ?
DRA	Luke	18	27	He said to them : The things that are impossible with men , are possible with God .
DRA	Luke	18	28	Then Peter said : Behold , we have left all things , and have followed thee .
DRA	Luke	18	29	Who said to them : Amen , I say to you , there is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake ,
DRA	Luke	18	30	Who shall not receive much more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
DRA	Luke	18	31	Then Jesus took unto him the twelve , and said to them : Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man .
DRA	Luke	18	32	For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and scourged , and spit upon :
DRA	Luke	18	33	And after they have scourged him , they will put him to death ; and the third day he shall rise again .
DRA	Luke	18	34	And they understood none of these things , and this word was hid from them , and they understood not the things that were said .
DRA	Luke	18	35	Now it came to pass , when he drew nigh to Jericho , that a certain blind man sat by the way side , begging .
DRA	Luke	18	36	And when he heard the multitude passing by , he asked what this meant .
DRA	Luke	18	37	And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by .
DRA	Luke	18	38	And he cried out , saying : Jesus , son of David , have mercy on me .
DRA	Luke	18	39	And they that went before , rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried out much more : Son of David , have mercy on me .
DRA	Luke	18	40	And Jesus standing , commanded him to be brought unto him . And when he was come near , he asked him ,
DRA	Luke	18	41	Saying : What wilt thou that I do to thee ? But he said : Lord , that I may see .
DRA	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said to him : Receive thy sight : thy faith hath made thee whole .

DRA	Luke	19	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	19	2	And behold , there was a man named Zacheus , who was the chief of the publicans , and he was rich .
DRA	Luke	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was , and he could not for the crowd , because he was low of stature .
DRA	Luke	19	4	And running before , he climbed up into a sycamore tree , that he might see him ; for he was to pass that way .
DRA	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus was come to the place , looking up , he saw him , and said to him : Zacheus , make haste and come down ; for this day I must abide in thy house .
DRA	Luke	19	6	And he made haste and came down ; and received him with joy .
DRA	Luke	19	7	And when all saw it , they murmured , saying , that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner .
DRA	Luke	19	8	But Zacheus standing , said to the Lord : Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have wronged any man of any thing , I restore him fourfold .
DRA	Luke	19	9	Jesus said to him : This day is salvation come to this house , because he also is a son of Abraham .
DRA	Luke	19	10	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
DRA	Luke	19	11	As they were hearing these things , he added and spoke a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested .
DRA	Luke	19	12	He said therefore : A certain nobleman went into a far country , to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
DRA	Luke	19	13	And calling his ten servants , he gave them ten pounds , and said to them : Trade till I come .
DRA	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him : and they sent an embassage after him , saying : We will not have this man to reign over us .
DRA	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass , that he returned , having received the kingdom : and he commanded his servants to be called , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
DRA	Luke	19	16	And the first came , saying : Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
DRA	Luke	19	17	And he said to him : Well done , thou good servant , because thou hast been faithful in a little , thou shalt have power over ten cities .
DRA	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying : Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
DRA	Luke	19	20	And another came , saying : Lord , behold here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin ;
DRA	Luke	19	21	For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up what thou didst not lay down , and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow .
DRA	Luke	19	22	He saith to him : Out of thy own mouth I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up what I laid not down , and reaping that which I did not sow :
DRA	Luke	19	23	And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank , that at my coming , I might have exacted it with usury ?
DRA	Luke	19	24	And he said to them that stood by : Take the pound away from him , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
DRA	Luke	19	25	And they said to him : Lord , he hath ten pounds .
DRA	Luke	19	26	But I say to you , that to every one that hath shall be given , and he shall abound : and from him that hath not , even that which he hath , shall be taken from him .
DRA	Luke	19	27	But as for those my enemies , who would not have me reign over them , bring them hither , and kill them before me .
DRA	Luke	19	28	And having said these things , he went before , going up to Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania , unto the mount called Olivet , he sent two of his disciples ,
DRA	Luke	19	30	Saying : Go into the town which is over against you , at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied , on which no man ever hath sitten : loose him , and bring him hither .
DRA	Luke	19	31	And if any man shall ask you : Why do you loose him ? you shall say thus unto him : Because the Lord hath need of his service .
DRA	Luke	19	32	And they that were sent , went their way , and found the colt standing , as he had said unto them .
DRA	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said to them : Why loose you the colt ?
DRA	Luke	19	34	But they said : Because the Lord hath need of him .
DRA	Luke	19	35	And they brought him to Jesus . And casting their garments on the colt , they set Jesus thereon .
DRA	Luke	19	36	And as he went , they spread their clothes underneath in the way .
DRA	Luke	19	37	And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet , the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice , for all the mighty works they had seen ,
DRA	Luke	19	38	Saying : Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord , peace in heaven , and glory on high !
DRA	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees , from amongst the multitude , said to him : Master , rebuke thy disciples .
DRA	Luke	19	40	To whom he said : I say to you , that if these shall hold their peace , the stones will cry out .
DRA	Luke	19	41	And when he drew near , seeing the city , he wept over it , saying :
DRA	Luke	19	42	If thou also hadst known , and that in this thy day , the things that are to thy peace ; but now they are hidden from thy eyes .
DRA	Luke	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee , and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and straiten thee on every side ,
DRA	Luke	19	44	And beat thee flat to the ground , and thy children who are in thee : and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone : because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation .
DRA	Luke	19	45	And entering into the temple , he began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought .
DRA	Luke	19	46	Saying to them : It is written : My house is the house of prayer . But you have made it a den of thieves .
DRA	Luke	19	47	And he was teaching daily in the temple . And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him :
DRA	Luke	19	48	And they found not what to do to him : for all the people were very attentive to hear him . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Luke	20	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	20	2	And spoke to him , saying : Tell us , by what authority dost thou these things ? or , Who is he that hath given thee this authority ?
DRA	Luke	20	3	And Jesus answering , said to them : I will also ask you one thing . Answer me :
DRA	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
DRA	Luke	20	5	But they thought within themselves , saying : If we shall say , From heaven : he will say : Why then did you not believe him ?
DRA	Luke	20	6	But if we say , Of men , the whole people will stone us : for they are persuaded that John was a prophet .
DRA	Luke	20	7	And they answered , that they knew not whence it was .
DRA	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them : Neither do I tell thee by what authority I do these things .
DRA	Luke	20	9	And he began to speak to the people this parable : A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it out to husbandmen : and he was abroad for a long time .
DRA	Luke	20	10	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard . Who , beating him , sent him away empty .
DRA	Luke	20	11	And again he sent another servant . But they beat him also , and treating him reproachfully , sent him away empty .
DRA	Luke	20	12	And again he sent the third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
DRA	Luke	20	13	Then the lord of the vineyard said : What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be , when they see him , they will reverence him .
DRA	Luke	20	14	Whom when the husbandmen saw , they thought within themselves , saying : This is the heir , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
DRA	Luke	20	15	So casting him out of the vineyard , they killed him . What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ?
DRA	Luke	20	16	He will come , and will destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . Which they hearing , said to him : God forbid .
DRA	Luke	20	17	But he looking on them , said : What is this then that is written , The stone , which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
DRA	Luke	20	18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone , shall be bruised : and upon whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
DRA	Luke	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him the same hour : but they feared the people , for they knew that he spoke this parable to them .
DRA	Luke	20	21	And they asked him , saying : Master , we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly : and thou dost not respect any person , but teachest the way of God in truth .
DRA	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar , or no ?
DRA	Luke	20	23	But he considering their guile , said to them : Why tempt you me ?
DRA	Luke	20	24	shew me a penny . Whose image and inscription hath it ? They answering , said to him , Caesar 's .
DRA	Luke	20	25	And he said to them : Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's : and to God the things that are God 's .
DRA	Luke	20	26	And they could not reprehend his word before the people : and wondering at his answer , they held their peace .
DRA	Luke	20	27	And there came to him some of the Sadducees , who deny that there is any resurrection , and they asked him ,
DRA	Luke	20	28	Saying : Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man 's brother die , having a wife , and he leave no children , that his brother should take her to wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
DRA	Luke	20	29	There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
DRA	Luke	20	30	And the next took her to wife , and he also died childless .
DRA	Luke	20	31	And the third took her . And in like manner all the seven , and they left no children , and died .
DRA	Luke	20	32	Last of all the woman died also .
DRA	Luke	20	33	In the resurrection therefore , whose wife of them shall she be ? For all the seven had her to wife .
DRA	Luke	20	34	And Jesus said to them : The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
DRA	Luke	20	35	But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world , and of the resurrection from the dead , shall neither be married , nor take wives .
DRA	Luke	20	36	Neither can they die any more : for they are equal to the angels , and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
DRA	Luke	20	37	Now that the dead rise again , Moses also shewed , at the bush , when he called the Lord , The God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ;
DRA	Luke	20	38	For he is not the God of the dead , but of the living : for all live to him .
DRA	Luke	20	39	And some of the scribes answering , said to him : Master , thou hast said well .
DRA	Luke	20	40	And after that they durst not ask him any more questions .
DRA	Luke	20	41	But he said to them : How say they that Christ is the son of David ?
DRA	Luke	20	42	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms : The Lord said to my Lord , sit thou on my right hand ,
DRA	Luke	20	43	Till I make thy enemies thy footstool .
DRA	Luke	20	44	David then calleth him Lord : and how is he his son ?
DRA	Luke	20	45	And in the hearing of all the people , he said to his disciples :

DRA	Luke	21	2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in two brass mites .
DRA	Luke	21	3	And he said : Verily I say to you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
DRA	Luke	21	4	For all these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of God : but she of her want , hath cast in all the living that she had .
DRA	Luke	21	5	And some saying of the temple , that it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said :
DRA	Luke	21	6	These things which you see , the days will come in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone that shall not be thrown down .
DRA	Luke	21	7	And they asked him , saying : Master , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when they shall begin to come to pass ?
DRA	Luke	21	8	Who said : Take heed you be not seduced ; for many will come in my name , saying , I am he ; and the time is at hand : go ye not therefore after them .
DRA	Luke	21	9	And when you shall hear of wars and seditions , be not terrified : these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not yet presently .
DRA	Luke	21	10	Then he said to them : Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
DRA	Luke	21	11	And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places , and pestilences , and famines , and terrors from heaven ; and there shall be great signs .
DRA	Luke	21	12	But before all these things , they will lay their hands upon you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons , dragging you before kings and governors , for my name 's sake .
DRA	Luke	21	13	And it shall happen unto you for a testimony .
DRA	Luke	21	14	Lay it up therefore into your hearts , not to meditate before how you shall answer :
DRA	Luke	21	15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay .
DRA	Luke	21	16	And you shall be betrayed by your parents and brethren , and kinsmen and friends ; and some of you they will put to death .
DRA	Luke	21	17	And you shall be hated by all men for my name 's sake .

DRA	Luke	21	23	But woe to them that are with child , and give suck in those days ; for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
DRA	Luke	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword ; and shall be led away captives into all nations ; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles ; till the times of the nations be fulfilled .
DRA	Luke	21	25	And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea and of the waves ;

DRA	Luke	21	28	But when these things begin to come to pass , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is at hand .
DRA	Luke	21	29	And he spoke to them in a similitude . See the fig tree , and all the trees :
DRA	Luke	21	30	When they now shoot forth their fruit , you know that summer is nigh ;
DRA	Luke	21	31	So you also , when you shall see these things come to pass , know that the kingdom of God is at hand .

DRA	Luke	22	2	And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death : but they feared the people .
DRA	Luke	22	3	And Satan entered into Judas , who was surnamed Iscariot , one of the twelve .
DRA	Luke	22	4	And he went , and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates , how he might betray him to them .
DRA	Luke	22	5	And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
DRA	Luke	22	6	And he promised . And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude .
DRA	Luke	22	7	And the day of the unleavened bread came , on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed .
DRA	Luke	22	8	And he sent Peter and John , saying : Go , and prepare for us the pasch , that we may eat .
DRA	Luke	22	9	But they said : Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
DRA	Luke	22	10	And he said to them : Behold , as you go into the city , there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water : follow him into the house where he entereth in .
DRA	Luke	22	11	And you shall say to the goodman of the house : The master saith to thee , Where is the guest chamber , where I may eat the pasch with my disciples ?
DRA	Luke	22	12	And he will shew you a large dining room , furnished ; and there prepare .
DRA	Luke	22	13	And they going , found as he had said to them , and made ready the pasch .
DRA	Luke	22	14	And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
DRA	Luke	22	15	And he said to them : With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you , before I suffer .
DRA	Luke	22	16	For I say to you , that from this time I will not eat it , till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	22	17	And having taken the chalice , he gave thanks , and said : Take , and divide it among you :
DRA	Luke	22	18	For I say to you , that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , till the kingdom of God come .
DRA	Luke	22	19	And taking bread , he gave thanks , and brake ; and gave to them , saying : This is my body , which is given for you . Do this for a commemoration of me .
DRA	Luke	22	20	In like manner the chalice also , after he had supped , saying : This is the chalice , the new testament in my blood , which shall be shed for you .
DRA	Luke	22	21	But yet behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
DRA	Luke	22	23	And they began to inquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
DRA	Luke	22	24	And there was also a strife amongst them , which of them should seem to be the greater .
DRA	Luke	22	25	And he said to them : The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them ; and they that have power over them , are called beneficent .
DRA	Luke	22	26	But you not so : but he that is the greater among you , let him become as the younger ; and he that is the leader , as he that serveth .
DRA	Luke	22	27	For which is greater , he that sitteth at table , or he that serveth ? Is it not he that sitteth at table ? But I am in the midst of you , as he that serveth :
DRA	Luke	22	28	And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations :
DRA	Luke	22	29	And I dispose to you , as my Father hath disposed to me , a kingdom ;
DRA	Luke	22	30	That you may eat and drink at my table , in my kingdom : and may sit upon thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
DRA	Luke	22	31	And the Lord said : Simon , Simon , behold Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
DRA	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and thou , being once converted , confirm thy brethren .
DRA	Luke	22	33	Who said to him : Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
DRA	Luke	22	34	And he said : I say to thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me . And he said to them :
DRA	Luke	22	35	When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , did you want anything ?
DRA	Luke	22	36	But they said : Nothing . Then said he unto them : But now he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise a scrip ; and he that hath not , let him sell his coat , and buy a sword .
DRA	Luke	22	37	For I say to you , that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me : And with the wicked was he reckoned . For the things concerning me have an end .
DRA	Luke	22	38	But they said : Lord , behold here are two swords . And he said to them , It is enough .
DRA	Luke	22	39	And going out , he went , according to his custom , to the mount of Olives . And his disciples also followed him .
DRA	Luke	22	40	And when he was come to the place , he said to them : Pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
DRA	Luke	22	41	And he was withdrawn away from them a stone 's cast ; and kneeling down , he prayed ,
DRA	Luke	22	42	Saying : Father , if thou wilt , remove this chalice from me : but yet not my will , but thine be done .
DRA	Luke	22	43	And there appeared to him an angel from heaven , strengthening him . And being in an agony , he prayed the longer .
DRA	Luke	22	44	And his sweat became as drops of blood , trickling down upon the ground .
DRA	Luke	22	45	And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow .
DRA	Luke	22	46	And he said to them : Why sleep you ? arise , pray , lest you enter into temptation .
DRA	Luke	22	47	As he was yet speaking , behold a multitude ; and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near to Jesus , for to kiss him .
DRA	Luke	22	48	And Jesus said to him : Judas , dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss ?
DRA	Luke	22	49	And they that were about him , seeing what would follow , said to him : Lord , shall we strike with the sword ?
DRA	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
DRA	Luke	22	51	But Jesus answering , said : Suffer ye thus far . And when he had touched his ear , he healed him .
DRA	Luke	22	52	And Jesus said to the chief priests , and magistrates of the temple , and the ancients , that were come unto him : Are ye come out , as it were against a thief , with swords and clubs ?
DRA	Luke	22	53	When I was daily with you in the temple , you did not stretch forth your hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
DRA	Luke	22	54	And apprehending him , they led him to the high priest 's house . But Peter followed afar off .
DRA	Luke	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were sitting about it , Peter was in the midst of them .
DRA	Luke	22	56	Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light , and had earnestly beheld him , she said : This man also was with him .
DRA	Luke	22	57	But he denied him , saying : Woman , I know him not .
DRA	Luke	22	58	And after a little while , another seeing him , said : Thou also art one of them . But Peter said : O man , I am not .
DRA	Luke	22	59	And after the space , as it were of one hour , another certain man affirmed , saying : Of a truth , this man was also with him ; for he is also a Galilean .
DRA	Luke	22	60	And Peter said : Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , as he was yet speaking , the cock crew .
DRA	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turning looked on Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , as he had said : Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
DRA	Luke	22	62	And Peter going out , wept bitterly .
DRA	Luke	22	63	And the men that held him , mocked him , and struck him .
DRA	Luke	22	64	And they blindfolded him , and smote his face . And they asked him , saying : Prophesy , who is it that struck thee ?
DRA	Luke	22	65	And blaspheming , many other things they said against him .
DRA	Luke	22	66	And as soon as it was day , the ancients of the people , and the chief priests and scribes , came together ; and they brought him into their council , saying : If thou be the Christ , tell us .
DRA	Luke	22	67	And he saith to them : If I shall tell you , you will not believe me .
DRA	Luke	22	68	And if I shall also ask you , you will not answer me , nor let me go .
DRA	Luke	22	69	But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God .
DRA	Luke	22	70	Then said they all : Art thou then the Son of God ? Who said : You say that I am .
DRA	Luke	22	71	And they said : What need we any further testimony ? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	23	23	But they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified ; and their voices prevailed .
DRA	Luke	23	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse him , saying : We have found this man perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , and saying that he is Christ the king .
DRA	Luke	23	3	And Pilate asked him , saying : Art thou the king of the Jews ? But he answering , said : Thou sayest it .
DRA	Luke	23	4	And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes : I find no cause in this man .
DRA	Luke	23	5	But they were more earnest , saying : He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee to this place .
DRA	Luke	23	6	But Pilate hearing Galilee , asked if the man were of Galilee ?
DRA	Luke	23	7	And when he understood that he was of Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him away to Herod , who was also himself at Jerusalem , in those days .
DRA	Luke	23	8	And Herod , seeing Jesus , was very glad ; for he was desirous of a long time to see him , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him .
DRA	Luke	23	9	And he questioned him in many words . But he answered him nothing .
DRA	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and the scribes stood by , earnestly accusing him .
DRA	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his army set him at nought , and mocked him , putting on him a white garment , and sent him back to Pilate .
DRA	Luke	23	12	And Herod and Pilate were made friends , that same day ; for before they were enemies one to another .
DRA	Luke	23	13	And Pilate , calling together the chief priests , and the magistrates , and the people ,
DRA	Luke	23	14	Said to them : You have presented unto me this man , as one that perverteth the people ; and behold I , having examined him before you , find no cause in this man , in those things wherein you accuse him .
DRA	Luke	23	15	No , nor Herod neither . For I sent you to him , and behold , nothing worthy of death is done to him .
DRA	Luke	23	16	I will chastise him therefore , and release him .
DRA	Luke	23	17	Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day .
DRA	Luke	23	18	But the whole multitude together cried out , saying : Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
DRA	Luke	23	19	Who , for a certain sedition made in the city , and for a murder , was cast into prison .
DRA	Luke	23	20	And Pilate again spoke to them , desiring to release Jesus .
DRA	Luke	23	21	But they cried again , saying : Crucify him , crucify him .
DRA	Luke	23	22	And he said to them the third time : Why , what evil hath this man done ? I find no cause of death in him . I will chastise him therefore , and let him go .
DRA	Luke	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
DRA	Luke	23	25	And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition , had been cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but Jesus he delivered up to their will .
DRA	Luke	23	26	And as they led him away , they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country ; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus .
DRA	Luke	23	27	And there followed him a great multitude of people , and of women , who bewailed and lamented him .
DRA	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turning to them , said : Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not over me ; but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
DRA	Luke	23	29	For behold , the days shall come , wherein they will say : Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that have not borne , and the paps that have not given suck .
DRA	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains : Fall upon us ; and to the hills : Cover us .
DRA	Luke	23	31	For if in the green wood they do these things , what shall be done in the dry ?
DRA	Luke	23	32	And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death .
DRA	Luke	23	33	And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary , they crucified him there ; and the robbers , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
DRA	Luke	23	34	And Jesus said : Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . But they , dividing his garments , cast lots .
DRA	Luke	23	35	And the people stood beholding , and the rulers with them derided him , saying : He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the elect of God .
DRA	Luke	23	36	And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
DRA	Luke	23	37	And saying : If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself .
DRA	Luke	23	38	And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew : THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
DRA	Luke	23	39	And one of those robbers who were hanged , blasphemed him , saying : If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
DRA	Luke	23	40	But the other answering , rebuked him , saying : Neither dost thou fear God , seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation ?
DRA	Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly , for we receive the due reward of our deeds ; but this man hath done no evil .
DRA	Luke	23	42	And he said to Jesus : Lord , remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom .
DRA	Luke	23	43	And Jesus said to him : Amen I say to thee , this day thou shalt be with me in paradise .
DRA	Luke	23	44	And it was almost the sixth hour ; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
DRA	Luke	23	45	And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
DRA	Luke	23	46	And Jesus crying out with a loud voice , said : Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit . And saying this , he gave up the ghost .
DRA	Luke	23	47	Now the centurion , seeing what was done , glorified God , saying : Indeed this was a just man .
DRA	Luke	23	48	And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight , and saw the things that were done , returned striking their breasts .
DRA	Luke	23	49	And all his acquaintance , and the women that had followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
DRA	Luke	23	50	And behold there was a man named Joseph , who was a counsellor , a good and just man ,
DRA	Luke	23	51	( The same had not consented to their counsel and doings ; ) of Arimathea , a city of Judea ; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God .
DRA	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
DRA	Luke	23	53	And taking him down , he wrapped him in fine linen , and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone , wherein never yet any man had been laid .
DRA	Luke	23	54	And it was the day of the Parasceve , and the sabbath drew on .
DRA	Luke	23	55	And the women that were come with him from Galilee , following after , saw the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
DRA	Luke	23	56	And returning , they prepared spices and ointments ; and on the sabbath day they rested , according to the commandment . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Luke	24	24	And some of our people went to the sepulchre , and found it so as the women had said , but him they found not .
DRA	Luke	24	1899	American Edition
DRA	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre .
DRA	Luke	24	3	And going in , they found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
DRA	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , as they were astonished in their mind at this , behold , two men stood by them , in shining apparel .
DRA	Luke	24	5	And as they were afraid , and bowed down their countenance towards the ground , they said unto them : Why seek you the living with the dead ?
DRA	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen . Remember how he spoke unto you , when he was in Galilee ,
DRA	Luke	24	7	Saying : The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
DRA	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words .
DRA	Luke	24	9	And going back from the sepulchre , they told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
DRA	Luke	24	10	And it was Mary Magdalen , and Joanna , and Mary of James , and the other women that were with them , who told these things to the apostles .
DRA	Luke	24	11	And these words seemed to them as idle tales ; and they did not believe them .
DRA	Luke	24	12	But Peter rising up , ran to the sepulchre , and stooping down , he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves ; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
DRA	Luke	24	13	And behold , two of them went , the same day , to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem , named Emmaus .
DRA	Luke	24	14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
DRA	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass , that while they talked and reasoned with themselves , Jesus himself also drawing near , went with them .
DRA	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were held , that they should not know him .
DRA	Luke	24	17	And he said to them : What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk , and are sad ?
DRA	Luke	24	18	And the one of them , whose name was Cleophas , answering , said to him : Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem , and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days ?
DRA	Luke	24	19	To whom he said : What things ? And they said : Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet , mighty in work and word before God and all the people ;
DRA	Luke	24	20	And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death , and crucified him .
DRA	Luke	24	21	But we hoped , that it was he that should have redeemed Israel : and now besides all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
DRA	Luke	24	22	Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us , who before it was light , were at the sepulchre ,
DRA	Luke	24	23	And not finding his body , came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , who say that he is alive .
DRA	Luke	24	25	Then he said to them : O foolish , and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken .
DRA	Luke	24	26	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things , and so to enter into his glory ?
DRA	Luke	24	27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded to them in all the scriptures , the things that were concerning him .
DRA	Luke	24	28	And they drew nigh to the town , whither they were going : and he made as though he would go farther .
DRA	Luke	24	29	But they constrained him ; saying : Stay with us , because it is towards evening , and the day is now far spent . And he went in with them .
DRA	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , whilst he was at table with them , he took bread , and blessed , and brake , and gave to them .
DRA	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened , and they knew him : and he vanished out of their sight .
DRA	Luke	24	32	And they said one to the other : Was not our heart burning within us , whilst he spoke in this way , and opened to us the scriptures ?
DRA	Luke	24	33	And rising up , the same hour , they went back to Jerusalem : and they found the eleven gathered together , and those that were staying with them ,
DRA	Luke	24	34	Saying : The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
DRA	Luke	24	35	And they told what things were done in the way ; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread .
DRA	Luke	24	36	Now whilst they were speaking these things , Jesus stood in the midst of them , and saith to them : Peace be to you ; it is I , fear not .
DRA	Luke	24	37	But they being troubled and frightened , supposed that they saw a spirit .
DRA	Luke	24	38	And he said to them : Why are you troubled , and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
DRA	Luke	24	39	See my hands and feet , that it is I myself ; handle , and see : for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as you see me to have .
DRA	Luke	24	40	And when he had said this , he shewed them his hands and feet .
DRA	Luke	24	41	But while they yet believed not , and wondered for joy , he said : Have you any thing to eat ?
DRA	Luke	24	42	And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish , and a honeycomb .
DRA	Luke	24	43	And when he had eaten before them , taking the remains , he gave to them .
DRA	Luke	24	44	And he said to them : These are the words which I spoke to you , while I was yet with you , that all things must needs be fulfilled , which are written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
DRA	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures .
DRA	Luke	24	46	And he said to them : Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise again from the dead , the third day :
DRA	Luke	24	47	And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name , unto all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
DRA	Luke	24	48	And you are witnesses of these things .
DRA	Luke	24	49	And I send the promise of my Father upon you : but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high .
DRA	Luke	24	50	And he led them out as far as Bethania : and lifting up his hands , he blessed them .
DRA	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass , whilst he blessed them , he departed from them , and was carried up to heaven .
DRA	Luke	24	52	And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy .
DRA	Luke	24	53	And they were always in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
DRA	John	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God .
DRA	John	1	3	All things were made by him : and without him was made nothing that was made .
DRA	John	1	4	In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
DRA	John	1	5	And the light shineth in darkness , and the darkness did not comprehend it .
DRA	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
DRA	John	1	7	This man came for a witness , to give testimony of the light , that all men might believe through him .
DRA	John	1	8	He was not the light , but was to give testimony of the light .
DRA	John	1	9	That was the true light , which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world .
DRA	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
DRA	John	1	11	He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
DRA	John	1	12	But as many as received him , he gave them power to be made the sons of God , to them that believe in his name .
DRA	John	1	13	Who are born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
DRA	John	1	14	And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we saw his glory , the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
DRA	John	1	15	John beareth witness of him , and crieth out , saying : This was he of whom I spoke : He that shall come after me , is preferred before me : because he was before me .
DRA	John	1	16	And of his fulness we all have received , and grace for grace .
DRA	John	1	17	For the law was given by Moses ; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
DRA	John	1	18	No man hath seen God at any time : the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
DRA	John	1	19	And this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him , to ask him : Who art thou ?
DRA	John	1	20	And he confessed , and did not deny : and he confessed : I am not the Christ .
DRA	John	1	21	And they asked him : What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he said : I am not . Art thou the prophet ? And he answered : No .
DRA	John	1	22	They said therefore unto him : Who art thou , that we may give an answer to them that sent us ? What sayest thou of thyself ?
DRA	John	1	23	He said : I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness , make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Isaias .
DRA	John	1	24	And they that were sent , were of the Pharisees .
DRA	John	1	25	And they asked him , and said to him : Why then dost thou baptize , if thou be not Christ , nor Elias , nor the prophet ?
DRA	John	1	26	John answered them , saying : I baptize with water ; but there hath stood one in the midst of you , whom you know not .
DRA	John	1	27	The same is he that shall come after me , who is preferred before me : the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose .
DRA	John	1	28	These things were done in Bethania , beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
DRA	John	1	29	The next day , John saw Jesus coming to him , and he saith : Behold the Lamb of God , behold him who taketh away the sin of the world .
DRA	John	1	30	This is he , of whom I said : After me there cometh a man , who is preferred before me : because he was before me .
DRA	John	1	31	And I knew him not , but that he may be made manifest in Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
DRA	John	1	32	And John gave testimony , saying : I saw the Spirit coming down , as a dove from heaven , and he remained upon him .
DRA	John	1	33	And I knew him not ; but he who sent me to baptize with water , said to me : He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining upon him , he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost .
DRA	John	1	34	And I saw , and I gave testimony , that this is the Son of God .
DRA	John	1	35	The next day again John stood , and two of his disciples .
DRA	John	1	36	And beholding Jesus walking , he saith : Behold the Lamb of God .
DRA	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
DRA	John	1	38	And Jesus turning , and seeing them following him , saith to them : What seek you ? Who said to him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
DRA	John	1	39	He saith to them : Come and see . They came , and saw where he abode , and they stayed with him that day : now it was about the tenth hour .
DRA	John	1	40	And Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who had heard of John , and followed him .
DRA	John	1	41	He findeth first his brother Simon , and saith to him : We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
DRA	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . And Jesus looking upon him , said : Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is interpreted Peter .
DRA	John	1	43	On the following day , he would go forth into Galilee , and he findeth Philip . And Jesus saith to him : Follow me .
DRA	John	1	44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
DRA	John	1	45	Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith to him : We have found him of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets did write , Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth .
DRA	John	1	46	And Nathanael said to him : Can any thing of good come from Nazareth ? Philip saith to him : Come and see .
DRA	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him : and he saith of him : Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom there is no guile .
DRA	John	1	48	Nathanael saith to him : Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered , and said to him : Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
DRA	John	1	49	Nathanael answered him , and said : Rabbi , thou art the Son of God , thou art the King of Israel .
DRA	John	1	50	Jesus answered , and said to him : Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , thou believest : greater things than these shalt thou see .
DRA	John	1	51	And he saith to him : Amen , amen I say to you , you shall see the heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	2	2	And Jesus also was invited , and his disciples , to the marriage .
DRA	John	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	2	3	And the wine failing , the mother of Jesus saith to him : They have no wine .
DRA	John	2	4	And Jesus saith to her : Woman , what is that to me and to thee ? my hour is not yet come .
DRA	John	2	5	His mother saith to the waiters : Whatsoever he shall say to you , do ye .
DRA	John	2	6	Now there were set there six waterpots of stone , according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three measures apiece .
DRA	John	2	7	Jesus saith to them : Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
DRA	John	2	8	And Jesus saith to them : Draw out now , and carry to the chief steward of the feast . And they carried it .
DRA	John	2	9	And when the chief steward had tasted the water made wine , and knew not whence it was , but the waiters knew who had drawn the water ; the chief steward calleth the bridegroom ,
DRA	John	2	10	And saith to him : Every man at first setteth forth good wine , and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse . But thou hast kept the good wine until now .
DRA	John	2	11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee ; and manifested his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
DRA	John	2	12	After this he went down to Capharnaum , he and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they remained there not many days .
DRA	John	2	13	And the pasch of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
DRA	John	2	14	And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting .
DRA	John	2	15	And when he had made , as it were , a scourge of little cords , he drove them all out of the temple , the sheep also and the oxen , and the money of the changers he poured out , and the tables he overthrew .
DRA	John	2	16	And to them that sold doves he said : Take these things hence , and make not the house of my Father a house of traffic .
DRA	John	2	17	And his disciples remembered , that it was written : The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up .
DRA	John	2	18	The Jews , therefore , answered , and said to him : What sign dost thou shew unto us , seeing thou dost these things ?
DRA	John	2	19	Jesus answered , and said to them : Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
DRA	John	2	20	The Jews then said : Six and forty years was this temple in building ; and wilt thou raise it up in three days ?
DRA	John	2	21	But he spoke of the temple of his body .
DRA	John	2	22	When therefore he was risen again from the dead , his disciples remembered , that he had said this , and they believed the scripture , and the word that Jesus had said .
DRA	John	2	23	Now when he was at Jerusalem , at the pasch , upon the festival day , many believed in his name , seeing his signs which he did .
DRA	John	2	24	But Jesus did not trust himself unto them , for that he knew all men ,
DRA	John	2	25	And because he needed not that any should give testimony of man : for he knew what was in man . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	3	3	Jesus answered , and said to him : Amen , amen I say to thee , unless a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God .
DRA	John	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	3	2	This man came to Jesus by night , and said to him : Rabbi , we know that thou art come a teacher from God ; for no man can do these signs which thou dost , unless God be with him .
DRA	John	3	4	Nicodemus saith to him : How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born again ?
DRA	John	3	5	Jesus answered : Amen , amen I say to thee , unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost , he can not enter into the kingdom of God .
DRA	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh , is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit , is spirit .
DRA	John	3	7	Wonder not , that I said to thee , you must be born again .
DRA	John	3	8	The Spirit breatheth where he will ; and thou hearest his voice , but thou knowest not whence he cometh , and whither he goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
DRA	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered , and said to him : How can these things be done ?
DRA	John	3	10	Jesus answered , and said to him : Art thou a master in Israel , and knowest not these things ?
DRA	John	3	11	Amen , amen I say to thee , that we speak what we know , and we testify what we have seen , and you receive not our testimony .
DRA	John	3	12	If I have spoken to you earthly things , and you believe not ; how will you believe , if I shall speak to you heavenly things ?
DRA	John	3	13	And no man hath ascended into heaven , but he that descended from heaven , the Son of man who is in heaven .
DRA	John	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of man be lifted up :
DRA	John	3	15	That whosoever believeth in him , may not perish ; but may have life everlasting .
DRA	John	3	16	For God so loved the world , as to give his only begotten Son ; that whosoever believeth in him , may not perish , but may have life everlasting .
DRA	John	3	17	For God sent not his Son into the world , to judge the world , but that the world may be saved by him .
DRA	John	3	18	He that believeth in him is not judged . But he that doth not believe , is already judged : because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
DRA	John	3	19	And this is the judgment : because the light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than the light : for their works were evil .
DRA	John	3	20	For every one that doth evil hateth the light , and cometh not to the light , that his works may not be reproved .
DRA	John	3	21	But he that doth truth , cometh to the light , that his works may be made manifest , because they are done in God .
DRA	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea : and there he abode with them , and baptized .
DRA	John	3	23	And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim ; because there was much water there ; and they came and were baptized .
DRA	John	3	24	For John was not yet cast into prison .
DRA	John	3	25	And there arose a question between some of John 's disciples and the Jews concerning purification :
DRA	John	3	26	And they came to John , and said to him : Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou gavest testimony , behold he baptizeth , and all men come to him .
DRA	John	3	27	John answered , and said : A man can not receive any thing , unless it be given him from heaven .
DRA	John	3	28	You yourselves do bear me witness , that I said , I am not Christ , but that I am sent before him .
DRA	John	3	29	He that hath the bride , is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , who standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom 's voice . This my joy therefore is fulfilled .
DRA	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
DRA	John	3	31	He that cometh from above , is above all . He that is of the earth , of the earth he is , and of the earth he speaketh . He that cometh from heaven , is above all .
DRA	John	3	32	And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth : and no man receiveth his testimony .

DRA	John	4	4	And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria .
DRA	John	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	4	2	( Though Jesus himself did not baptize , but his disciples , )
DRA	John	4	3	He left Judea , and went again into Galilee .
DRA	John	4	5	He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria , which is called Sichar , near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
DRA	John	4	6	Now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well . It was about the sixth hour .
DRA	John	4	7	There cometh a woman of Samaria , to draw water . Jesus saith to her : Give me to drink .
DRA	John	4	8	For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats .
DRA	John	4	9	Then that Samaritan woman saith to him : How dost thou , being a Jew , ask of me to drink , who am a Samaritan woman ? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans .
DRA	John	4	10	Jesus answered , and said to her : If thou didst know the gift of God , and who he is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
DRA	John	4	11	The woman saith to him : Sir , thou hast nothing wherein to draw , and the well is deep ; from whence then hast thou living water ?
DRA	John	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
DRA	John	4	13	Jesus answered , and said to her : Whosoever drinketh of this water , shall thirst again ; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him , shall not thirst for ever :
DRA	John	4	14	But the water that I will give him , shall become in him a fountain of water , springing up into life everlasting .
DRA	John	4	15	The woman saith to him : Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst , nor come hither to draw .
DRA	John	4	16	Jesus saith to her : Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
DRA	John	4	17	The woman answered , and said : I have no husband . Jesus said to her : Thou hast said well , I have no husband :
DRA	John	4	18	For thou hast had five husbands : and he whom thou now hast , is not thy husband . This thou hast said truly .
DRA	John	4	19	The woman saith to him : Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
DRA	John	4	20	Our fathers adored on this mountain , and you say , that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore .
DRA	John	4	21	Jesus saith to her : Woman , believe me , that the hour cometh , when you shall neither on this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , adore the Father .
DRA	John	4	22	You adore that which you know not : we adore that which we know ; for salvation is of the Jews .
DRA	John	4	23	But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth . For the Father also seeketh such to adore him .
DRA	John	4	24	God is a spirit ; and they that adore him , must adore him in spirit and in truth .
DRA	John	4	25	The woman saith to him : I know that the Messias cometh ( who is called Christ ) ; therefore , when he is come , he will tell us all things .
DRA	John	4	26	Jesus saith to her : I am he , who am speaking with thee .
DRA	John	4	27	And immediately his disciples came ; and they wondered that he talked with the woman . Yet no man said : What seekest thou ? or , why talkest thou with her ?
DRA	John	4	28	The woman therefore left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men there :
DRA	John	4	29	Come , and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done . Is not he the Christ ?
DRA	John	4	30	They went therefore out of the city , and came unto him .
DRA	John	4	31	In the mean time the disciples prayed him , saying : Rabbi , eat .
DRA	John	4	32	But he said to them : I have meat to eat , which you know not .
DRA	John	4	33	The disciples therefore said one to another : Hath any man brought him to eat ?
DRA	John	4	34	Jesus saith to them : My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , that I may perfect his work .
DRA	John	4	35	Do you not say , There are yet four months , and then the harvest cometh ? Behold , I say to you , lift up your eyes , and see the countries ; for they are white already to harvest .
DRA	John	4	36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting : that both he that soweth , and he that reapeth , may rejoice together .
DRA	John	4	37	For in this is the saying true : That it is one man that soweth , and it is another that reapeth .
DRA	John	4	38	I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour : others have laboured , and you have entered into their labours .
DRA	John	4	39	Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him , for the word of the woman giving testimony : He told me all things whatsoever I have done .
DRA	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans were come to him , they desired that he would tarry there . And he abode there two days .
DRA	John	4	41	And many more believed in him because of his own word .
DRA	John	4	42	And they said to the woman : We now believe , not for thy saying : for we ourselves have heard him , and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world .
DRA	John	4	43	Now after two days , he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
DRA	John	4	44	For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
DRA	John	4	45	And when he was come into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day ; for they also went to the festival day .
DRA	John	4	46	He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain ruler , whose son was sick at Capharnaum .
DRA	John	4	47	He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee , went to him , and prayed him to come down , and heal his son ; for he was at the point of death .
DRA	John	4	48	Jesus therefore said to him : Unless you see signs and wonders , you believe not .
DRA	John	4	49	The ruler saith to him : Lord , come down before that my son die .
DRA	John	4	50	Jesus saith to him : Go thy way ; thy son liveth . The man believed the word which Jesus said to him , and went his way .
DRA	John	4	51	And as he was going down , his servants met him ; and they brought word , saying , that his son lived .
DRA	John	4	52	He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better . And they said to him : Yesterday , at the seventh hour , the fever left him .
DRA	John	4	53	The father therefore knew , that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him , Thy son liveth ; and himself believed , and his whole house .
DRA	John	4	54	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judea into Galilee . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	5	5	And there was a certain man there , that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity .
DRA	John	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	5	2	Now there is at Jerusalem a pond , called Probatica , which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida , having five porches .
DRA	John	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of sick , of blind , of lame , of withered ; waiting for the moving of the water .
DRA	John	5	4	And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond ; and the water was moved . And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water , was made whole , of whatsoever infirmity he lay under .
DRA	John	5	6	Him when Jesus had seen lying , and knew that he had been now a long time , he saith to him : Wilt thou be made whole ?
DRA	John	5	7	The infirm man answered him : Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pond . For whilst I am coming , another goeth down before me .
DRA	John	5	8	Jesus saith to him : Arise , take up thy bed , and walk .
DRA	John	5	9	And immediately the man was made whole : and he took up his bed , and walked . And it was the sabbath that day .
DRA	John	5	10	The Jews therefore said to him that was healed : It is the sabbath ; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed .
DRA	John	5	11	He answered them : He that made me whole , he said to me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
DRA	John	5	12	They asked him therefore : Who is that man who said to thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ?
DRA	John	5	13	But he who was healed , knew not who it was ; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place .
DRA	John	5	14	Afterwards , Jesus findeth him in the temple , and saith to him : Behold thou art made whole : sin no more , lest some worse thing happen to thee .
DRA	John	5	15	The man went his way , and told the Jews , that it was Jesus who had made him whole .
DRA	John	5	16	Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , because he did these things on the sabbath .
DRA	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them : My Father worketh until now ; and I work .
DRA	John	5	18	Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he did not only break the sabbath , but also said God was his Father , making himself equal to God .
DRA	John	5	19	Then Jesus answered , and said to them : Amen , amen , I say unto you , the Son can not do any thing of himself , but what he seeth the Father doing : for what things soever he doth , these the Son also doth in like manner .
DRA	John	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things which himself doth : and greater works than these will he shew him , that you may wonder .
DRA	John	5	21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and giveth life : so the Son also giveth life to whom he will .
DRA	John	5	22	For neither doth the Father judge any man , but hath given all judgment to the Son .
DRA	John	5	23	That all men may honour the Son , as they honour the Father . He who honoureth not the Son , honoureth not the Father , who hath sent him .
DRA	John	5	24	Amen , amen I say unto you , that he who heareth my word , and believeth him that sent me , hath life everlasting ; and cometh not into judgment , but is passed from death to life .
DRA	John	5	25	Amen , amen I say unto you , that the hour cometh , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God , and they that hear shall live .
DRA	John	5	26	For as the Father hath life in himself , so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself :
DRA	John	5	27	And he hath given him power to do judgment , because he is the Son of man .
DRA	John	5	28	Wonder not at this ; for the hour cometh , wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God .
DRA	John	5	29	And they that have done good things , shall come forth unto the resurrection of life ; but they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of judgment .
DRA	John	5	30	I can not of myself do any thing . As I hear , so I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not my own will , but the will of him that sent me .
DRA	John	5	31	If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
DRA	John	5	32	There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
DRA	John	5	33	You sent to John , and he gave testimony to the truth .
DRA	John	5	34	But I receive not testimony from man : but I say these things , that you may be saved .
DRA	John	5	35	He was a burning and a shining light : and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light .
DRA	John	5	36	But I have a greater testimony than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect ; the works themselves , which I do , give testimony of me , that the Father hath sent me .
DRA	John	5	37	And the Father himself who hath sent me , hath given testimony of me : neither have you heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
DRA	John	5	38	And you have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him you believe not .
DRA	John	5	39	Search the scriptures , for you think in them to have life everlasting ; and the same are they that give testimony of me .
DRA	John	5	40	And you will not come to me that you may have life .
DRA	John	5	41	I receive glory not from men .
DRA	John	5	42	But I know you , that you have not the love of God in you .
DRA	John	5	43	I am come in the name of my Father , and you receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him you will receive .
DRA	John	5	44	How can you believe , who receive glory one from another : and the glory which is from God alone , you do not seek ?
DRA	John	5	45	Think not that I will accuse you to the Father . There is one that accuseth you , Moses , in whom you trust .
DRA	John	5	46	For if you did believe Moses , you would perhaps believe me also ; for he wrote of me .
DRA	John	5	47	But if you do not believe his writings , how will you believe my words ? Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	6	6	And this he said to try him ; for he himself knew what he would do .
DRA	John	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	6	2	And a great multitude followed him , because they saw the miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
DRA	John	6	3	Jesus therefore went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
DRA	John	6	4	Now the pasch , the festival day of the Jews , was near at hand .
DRA	John	6	5	When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes , and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him , he said to Philip : Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
DRA	John	6	7	Philip answered him : Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one may take a little .
DRA	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , saith to him :
DRA	John	6	9	There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves , and two fishes ; but what are these among so many ?
DRA	John	6	10	Then Jesus said : Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . The men therefore sat down , in number about five thousand .
DRA	John	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves : and when he had given thanks , he distributed to them that were set down . In like manner also of the fishes , as much as they would .
DRA	John	6	12	And when they were filled , he said to his disciples : Gather up the fragments that remain , lest they be lost .
DRA	John	6	13	They gathered up therefore , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above to them that had eaten .
DRA	John	6	14	Now those men , when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done , said : This is of a truth the prophet , that is to come into the world .
DRA	John	6	15	Jesus therefore , when he knew that they would come to take him by force , and make him king , fled again into the mountain himself alone .
DRA	John	6	16	And when evening was come , his disciples went down to the sea .
DRA	John	6	17	And when they had gone up into a ship , they went over the sea to Capharnaum ; and it was now dark , and Jesus was not come unto them .
DRA	John	6	18	And the sea arose , by reason of a great wind that blew .
DRA	John	6	19	When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking upon the sea , and drawing nigh to the ship , and they were afraid .
DRA	John	6	20	But he saith to them : It is I ; be not afraid .
DRA	John	6	21	They were willing therefore to take him into the ship ; and presently the ship was at the land to which they were going .
DRA	John	6	22	The next day , the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea , saw that there was no other ship there but one , and that Jesus had not entered into the ship with his disciples , but that his disciples were gone away alone .
DRA	John	6	23	But other ships came in from Tiberias ; nigh unto the place where they had eaten the bread , the Lord giving thanks .
DRA	John	6	24	When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they took shipping , and came to Capharnaum , seeking for Jesus .
DRA	John	6	25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him : Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
DRA	John	6	26	Jesus answered them , and said : Amen , amen I say to you , you seek me , not because you have seen miracles , but because you did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
DRA	John	6	27	Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that which endureth unto life everlasting , which the Son of man will give you . For him hath God , the Father , sealed .
DRA	John	6	28	They said therefore unto him : What shall we do , that we may work the works of God ?
DRA	John	6	29	Jesus answered , and said to them : This is the work of God , that you believe in him whom he hath sent .
DRA	John	6	30	They said therefore to him : What sign therefore dost thou shew , that we may see , and may believe thee ? What dost thou work ?
DRA	John	6	31	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert , as it is written : He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
DRA	John	6	32	Then Jesus said to them : Amen , amen I say to you ; Moses gave you not bread from heaven , but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
DRA	John	6	33	For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life to the world .
DRA	John	6	34	They said therefore unto him : Lord , give us always this bread .
DRA	John	6	35	And Jesus said to them : I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall not hunger : and he that believeth in me shall never thirst .
DRA	John	6	36	But I said unto you , that you also have seen me , and you believe not .
DRA	John	6	37	All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me , I will not cast out .
DRA	John	6	38	Because I came down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him that sent me .
DRA	John	6	39	Now this is the will of the Father who sent me : that of all that he hath given me , I should lose nothing ; but should raise it up again in the last day .
DRA	John	6	40	And this is the will of my Father that sent me : that every one who seeth the Son , and believeth in him , may have life everlasting , and I will raise him up in the last day .
DRA	John	6	41	The Jews therefore murmured at him , because he had said : I am the living bread which came down from heaven .
DRA	John	6	42	And they said : Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How then saith he , I came down from heaven ?
DRA	John	6	43	Jesus therefore answered , and said to them : Murmur not among yourselves .
DRA	John	6	44	No man can come to me , except the Father , who hath sent me , draw him ; and I will raise him up in the last day .
DRA	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets : And they shall all be taught of God . Every one that hath heard of the Father , and hath learned , cometh to me .
DRA	John	6	46	Not that any man hath seen the Father ; but he who is of God , he hath seen the Father .
DRA	John	6	47	Amen , amen I say unto you : He that believeth in me , hath everlasting life .
DRA	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
DRA	John	6	49	Your fathers did eat manna in the desert , and are dead .
DRA	John	6	50	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven ; that if any man eat of it , he may not die .
DRA	John	6	51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven .
DRA	John	6	52	If any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever ; and the bread that I will give , is my flesh , for the life of the world .
DRA	John	6	53	The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying : How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
DRA	John	6	54	Then Jesus said to them : Amen , amen I say unto you : Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , you shall not have life in you .
DRA	John	6	55	He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath everlasting life : and I will raise him up in the last day .
DRA	John	6	56	For my flesh is meat indeed : and my blood is drink indeed .
DRA	John	6	57	He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , abideth in me , and I in him .
DRA	John	6	58	As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father ; so he that eateth me , the same also shall live by me .
DRA	John	6	59	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead . He that eateth this bread , shall live for ever .
DRA	John	6	60	These things he said , teaching in the synagogue , in Capharnaum .
DRA	John	6	61	Many therefore of his disciples , hearing it , said : This saying is hard , and who can hear it ?
DRA	John	6	62	But Jesus , knowing in himself , that his disciples murmured at this , said to them : Doth this scandalize you ?
DRA	John	6	63	If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
DRA	John	6	64	It is the spirit that quickeneth : the flesh profiteth nothing . The words that I have spoken to you , are spirit and life .
DRA	John	6	65	But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning , who they were that did not believe , and who he was , that would betray him .
DRA	John	6	66	And he said : Therefore did I say to you , that no man can come to me , unless it be given him by my Father .
DRA	John	6	67	After this many of his disciples went back ; and walked no more with him .
DRA	John	6	68	Then Jesus said to the twelve : Will you also go away ?
DRA	John	6	69	And Simon Peter answered him : Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
DRA	John	6	70	And we have believed and have known , that thou art the Christ , the Son of God .
DRA	John	6	71	Jesus answered them : Have not I chosen you twelve ; and one of you is a devil ?
DRA	John	6	72	Now he meant Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon : for this same was about to betray him , whereas he was one of the twelve . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	7	7	The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth : because I give testimony of it , that the works thereof are evil .
DRA	John	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	7	2	Now the Jews ' feast of tabernacles was at hand .
DRA	John	7	3	And his brethren said to him : Pass from hence , and go into Judea ; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost .
DRA	John	7	4	For there is no man that doth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , manifest thyself to the world .
DRA	John	7	5	For neither did his brethren believe in him .
DRA	John	7	6	Then Jesus said to them : My time is not yet come ; but your time is always ready .
DRA	John	7	8	Go you up to this festival day , but I go not up to this festival day : because my time is not accomplished .
DRA	John	7	9	When he had said these things , he himself stayed in Galilee .
DRA	John	7	10	But after his brethren were gone up , then he also went up to the feast , not openly , but , as it were , in secret .
DRA	John	7	11	The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day , and said : Where is he ?
DRA	John	7	12	And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him . For some said : He is a good man . And others said : No , but he seduceth the people .
DRA	John	7	13	Yet no man spoke openly of him , for fear of the Jews .
DRA	John	7	14	Now about the midst of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
DRA	John	7	15	And the Jews wondered , saying : How doth this man know letters , having never learned ?
DRA	John	7	16	Jesus answered them , and said : My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
DRA	John	7	17	If any man do the will of him ; he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
DRA	John	7	18	He that speaketh of himself , seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him , he is true , and there is no injustice in him .
DRA	John	7	19	Did Moses not give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ?
DRA	John	7	20	Why seek you to kill me ? The multitude answered , and said : Thou hast a devil ; who seeketh to kill thee ?
DRA	John	7	21	Jesus answered , and said to them : One work I have done ; and you all wonder :
DRA	John	7	22	Therefore , Moses gave you circumcision ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man .
DRA	John	7	23	If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day , that the law of Moses may not be broken ; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day ?
DRA	John	7	24	Judge not according to the appearance , but judge just judgment .
DRA	John	7	25	Some therefore of Jerusalem said : Is not this he whom they seek to kill ?
DRA	John	7	26	And behold , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing to him . Have the rulers known for a truth , that this is the Christ ?
DRA	John	7	27	But we know this man , whence he is : but when the Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
DRA	John	7	28	Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching , and saying : You both know me , and you know whence I am : and I am not come of myself ; but he that sent me , is true , whom you know not .
DRA	John	7	29	I know him , because I am from him , and he hath sent me .
DRA	John	7	30	They sought therefore to apprehend him : and no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
DRA	John	7	31	But of the people many believed in him , and said : When the Christ cometh , shall he do more miracles , than these which this man doth ?
DRA	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him : and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him .
DRA	John	7	33	Jesus therefore said to them : Yet a little while I am with you : and then I go to him that sent me .
DRA	John	7	34	You shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither you can not come .
DRA	John	7	35	The Jews therefore said among themselves : Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
DRA	John	7	36	What is this saying that he hath said : You shall seek me , and shall not find me ; and where I am , you can not come ?
DRA	John	7	37	And on the last , and great day of the festivity , Jesus stood and cried , saying : If any man thirst , let him come to me , and drink .
DRA	John	7	38	He that believeth in me , as the scripture saith , Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
DRA	John	7	39	Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive , who believed in him : for as yet the Spirit was not given , because Jesus was not yet glorified .
DRA	John	7	40	Of that multitude therefore , when they had heard these words of his , some said : This is the prophet indeed .
DRA	John	7	41	Others said : This is the Christ . But some said : Doth the Christ come out of Galilee ?
DRA	John	7	42	Doth not the scripture say : That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem the town where David was ?
DRA	John	7	43	So there arose a dissension among the people because of him .
DRA	John	7	44	And some of them would have apprehended him : but no man laid hands on him .
DRA	John	7	45	The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees . And they said to them : Why have you not brought him ?
DRA	John	7	46	The ministers answered : Never did man speak like this man .
DRA	John	7	47	The Pharisees therefore answered them : Are you also seduced ?
DRA	John	7	48	Hath any one of the rulers believed in him , or of the Pharisees ?
DRA	John	7	49	But this multitude , that knoweth not the law , are accursed .
DRA	John	7	50	Nicodemus said to them , ( he that came to him by night , who was one of them : )
DRA	John	7	51	Doth our law judge any man , unless it first hear him , and know what he doth ?

DRA	John	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	8	2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him , and sitting down he taught them .
DRA	John	8	3	And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery : and they set her in the midst ,
DRA	John	8	4	And said to him : Master , this woman was even now taken in adultery .
DRA	John	8	5	Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one . But what sayest thou ?
DRA	John	8	6	And this they said tempting him , that they might accuse him . But Jesus bowing himself down , wrote with his finger on the ground .
DRA	John	8	7	When therefore they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said to them : He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
DRA	John	8	9	But they hearing this , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest . And Jesus alone remained , and the woman standing in the midst .
DRA	John	8	10	Then Jesus lifting up himself , said to her : Woman , where are they that accused thee ? Hath no man condemned thee ?
DRA	John	8	11	Who said : No man , Lord . And Jesus said : Neither will I condemn thee . Go , and now sin no more .
DRA	John	8	12	Again therefore , Jesus spoke to them , saying : I am the light of the world : he that followeth me , walketh not in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
DRA	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said to him : Thou givest testimony of thyself : thy testimony is not true .
DRA	John	8	14	Jesus answered , and said to them : Although I give testimony of myself , my testimony is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go : but you know not whence I come , or whither I go .
DRA	John	8	15	You judge according to the flesh : I judge not any man .
DRA	John	8	16	And if I do judge , my judgment is true : because I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
DRA	John	8	17	And in your law it is written , that the testimony of two men is true .
DRA	John	8	18	I am one that give testimony of myself : and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me .
DRA	John	8	19	They said therefore to him : Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered : Neither me do you know , nor my Father : if you did know me , perhaps you would know my Father also .
DRA	John	8	20	These words Jesus spoke in the treasury , teaching in the temple : and no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
DRA	John	8	21	Again therefore Jesus said to them : I go , and you shall seek me , and you shall die in your sin . Whither I go , you can not come .
DRA	John	8	22	The Jews therefore said : Will he kill himself , because he said : Whither I go , you can not come ?
DRA	John	8	23	And he said to them : You are from beneath , I am from above . You are of this world , I am not of this world .
DRA	John	8	24	Therefore I said to you , that you shall die in your sins . For if you believe not that I am he , you shall die in your sin .
DRA	John	8	25	They said therefore to him : Who art thou ? Jesus said to them : The beginning , who also speak unto you .
DRA	John	8	26	Many things I have to speak and to judge of you . But he that sent me , is true : and the things I have heard of him , these same I speak in the world .
DRA	John	8	27	And they understood not , that he called God his Father .
DRA	John	8	28	Jesus therefore said to them : When you shall have lifted up the Son of man , then shall you know , that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself , but as the Father hath taught me , these things I speak :
DRA	John	8	29	And he that sent me , is with me , and he hath not left me alone : for I do always the things that please him .
DRA	John	8	30	When he spoke these things , many believed in him .
DRA	John	8	31	Then Jesus said to those Jews , who believed him : If you continue in my word , you shall be my disciples indeed .
DRA	John	8	32	And you shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
DRA	John	8	33	They answered him : We are the seed of Abraham , and we have never been slaves to any man : how sayest thou : you shall be free ?
DRA	John	8	34	Jesus answered them : Amen , amen I say unto you : that whosoever committeth sin , is the servant of sin .
DRA	John	8	35	Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever ; but the son abideth for ever .
DRA	John	8	36	If therefore the son shall make you free , you shall be free indeed .
DRA	John	8	37	I know that you are the children of Abraham : but you seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
DRA	John	8	38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and you do the things that you have seen with your father .
DRA	John	8	39	They answered , and said to him : Abraham is our father . Jesus saith to them : If you be the children of Abraham , do the works of Abraham .
DRA	John	8	40	But now you seek to kill me , a man who have spoken the truth to you , which I have heard of God . This Abraham did not .
DRA	John	8	41	You do the works of your father . They said therefore to him : We are not born of fornication : we have one Father , even God .
DRA	John	8	42	Jesus therefore said to them : If God were your Father , you would indeed love me . For from God I proceeded , and came ; for I came not of myself , but he sent me :
DRA	John	8	43	Why do you not know my speech ? Because you can not hear my word .
DRA	John	8	44	You are of your father the devil , and the desires of your father you will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and he stood not in the truth ; because truth is not in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father thereof .
DRA	John	8	45	But if I say the truth , you believe me not .
DRA	John	8	46	Which of you shall convince me of sin ? If I say the truth to you , why do you not believe me ?
DRA	John	8	47	He that is of God , heareth the words of God . Therefore you hear them not , because you are not of God .
DRA	John	8	48	The Jews therefore answered , and said to him : Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ?
DRA	John	8	49	Jesus answered : I have not a devil : but I honour my Father , and you have dishonoured me .
DRA	John	8	50	But I seek not my own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
DRA	John	8	51	Amen , amen I say to you : If any man keep my word , he shall not see death for ever .
DRA	John	8	52	The Jews therefore said : Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest : If any man keep my word , he shall not taste death for ever .
DRA	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who is dead ? and the prophets are dead . Whom dost thou make thyself ?
DRA	John	8	54	Jesus answered : If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . It is my Father that glorifieth me , of whom you say that he is your God .
DRA	John	8	55	And you have not known him , but I know him . And if I shall say that I know him not , I shall be like to you , a liar . But I do know him , and do keep his word .
DRA	John	8	56	Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day : he saw it , and was glad .
DRA	John	8	57	The Jews therefore said to him : Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
DRA	John	8	58	Jesus said to them : Amen , amen I say to you , before Abraham was made , I am .
DRA	John	8	59	They took up stones therefore to cast at him . But Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	9	9	But others said : No , but he is like him . But he said : I am he .
DRA	John	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him : Rabbi , who hath sinned , this man , or his parents , that he should be born blind ?
DRA	John	9	3	Jesus answered : Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents ; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
DRA	John	9	4	I must work the works of him that sent me , whilst it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
DRA	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
DRA	John	9	6	When he had said these things , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and spread the clay on his eyes ,
DRA	John	9	7	And said to him : Go , wash in the pool of Siloe , which is interpreted , Sent . He went therefore , and washed , and he came seeing .
DRA	John	9	8	The neighbours therefore , and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar , said : Is not this he that sat and begged ? Some said : This is he .
DRA	John	9	10	They said therefore to him : How were thy eyes opened ?
DRA	John	9	11	He answered : That man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed my eyes , and said to me : Go to the pool of Siloe , and wash. And I went , I washed , and I see .
DRA	John	9	12	And they said to him : Where is he ? He saith : I know not .
DRA	John	9	13	They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees .
DRA	John	9	14	Now it was the sabbath , when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
DRA	John	9	15	Again therefore the Pharisees asked him , how he had received his sight . But he said to them : He put clay upon my eyes , and I washed , and I see .
DRA	John	9	16	Some therefore of the Pharisees said : This man is not of God , who keepeth not the sabbath . But others said : How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? And there was a division among them .
DRA	John	9	17	They say therefore to the blind man again : What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes ? And he said : He is a prophet .
DRA	John	9	18	The Jews then did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight ,
DRA	John	9	19	And asked them , saying : Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How then doth he now see ?
DRA	John	9	20	His parents answered them , and said : We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
DRA	John	9	21	But how he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : ask himself : he is of age , let him speak for himself .
DRA	John	9	22	These things his parents said , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had already agreed among themselves , that if any man should confess him to be Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
DRA	John	9	23	Therefore did his parents say : He is of age , ask himself .
DRA	John	9	24	They therefore called the man again that had been blind , and said to him : Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner .
DRA	John	9	25	He said therefore to them : If he be a sinner , I know not : one thing I know , that whereas I was blind , now I see .
DRA	John	9	26	They said then to him : What did he to thee ? How did he open thy eyes ?
DRA	John	9	27	He answered them : I have told you already , and you have heard : why would you hear it again ? will you also become his disciples ?
DRA	John	9	28	They reviled him therefore , and said : Be thou his disciple ; but we are the disciples of Moses .
DRA	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses : but as to this man , we know not from whence he is .
DRA	John	9	30	The man answered , and said to them : Why , herein is a wonderful thing , that you know not from whence he is , and he hath opened my eyes .
DRA	John	9	31	Now we know that God doth not hear sinners : but if a man be a server of God , and doth his will , him he heareth .
DRA	John	9	32	From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard , that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind .
DRA	John	9	33	Unless this man were of God , he could not do any thing .
DRA	John	9	34	They answered , and said to him : Thou wast wholly born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out .
DRA	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out : and when he had found him , he said to him : Dost thou believe in the Son of God ?
DRA	John	9	36	He answered , and said : Who is he , Lord , that I may believe in him ?
DRA	John	9	37	And Jesus said to him : Thou hast both seen him ; and it is he that talketh with thee .
DRA	John	9	38	And he said : I believe , Lord . And falling down , he adored him .
DRA	John	9	39	And Jesus said : For judgment I am come into this world ; that they who see not , may see ; and they who see , may become blind .
DRA	John	9	40	And some of the Pharisees , who were with him , heard : and they said unto him : Are we also blind ?
DRA	John	9	41	Jesus said to them : If you were blind , you should not have sin : but now you say : We see . Your sin remaineth . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	John	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	10	2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
DRA	John	10	3	To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
DRA	John	10	4	And when he hath let out his own sheep , he goeth before them : and the sheep follow him , because they know his voice .
DRA	John	10	5	But a stranger they follow not , but fly from him , because they know not the voice of strangers .
DRA	John	10	6	This proverb Jesus spoke to them . But they understood not what he spoke to them .
DRA	John	10	7	Jesus therefore said to them again : Amen , amen I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
DRA	John	10	8	All others , as many as have come , are thieves and robbers : and the sheep heard them not .
DRA	John	10	9	I am the door . By me , if any man enter in , he shall be saved : and he shall go in , and go out , and shall find pastures .
DRA	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep .
DRA	John	10	12	But the hireling , and he that is not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and flieth : and the wolf catcheth , and scattereth the sheep :
DRA	John	10	13	And the hireling flieth , because he is a hireling : and he hath no care for the sheep .
DRA	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd ; and I know mine , and mine know me .
DRA	John	10	15	As the Father knoweth me , and I know the Father : and I lay down my life for my sheep .
DRA	John	10	16	And other sheep I have , that are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice , and there shall be one fold and one shepherd .
DRA	John	10	17	Therefore doth the Father love me : because I lay down my life , that I may take it again .
DRA	John	10	18	No man taketh it away from me : but I lay it down of myself , and I have power to lay it down : and I have power to take it up again . This commandment have I received of my Father .
DRA	John	10	19	A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words .
DRA	John	10	20	And many of them said : He hath a devil , and is mad : why hear you him ?
DRA	John	10	21	Others said : These are not the words of one that hath a devil : Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
DRA	John	10	22	And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem : and it was winter .
DRA	John	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple , in Solomon 's porch .
DRA	John	10	24	The Jews therefore came round about him , and said to him : How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense ? If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
DRA	John	10	25	Jesus answered them : I speak to you , and you believe not : the works that I do in the name of my Father , they give testimony of me .
DRA	John	10	26	But you do not believe , because you are not of my sheep .
DRA	John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice : and I know them , and they follow me .
DRA	John	10	28	And I give them life everlasting ; and they shall not perish for ever , and no man shall pluck them out of my hand .
DRA	John	10	29	That which my Father hath given me , is greater than all : and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father .
DRA	John	10	30	I and the Father are one .
DRA	John	10	31	The Jews then took up stones to stone him .
DRA	John	10	32	Jesus answered them : Many good works I have shewed you from my Father ; for which of these works do you stone me ?
DRA	John	10	33	The Jews answered him : For a good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , maketh thyself God .
DRA	John	10	34	Jesus answered them : Is it not written in your law : I said you are gods ?
DRA	John	10	35	If he called them gods , to whom the word of God was spoken , and the scripture can not be broken ;
DRA	John	10	36	Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world : Thou blasphemest , because I said , I am the Son of God ?
DRA	John	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
DRA	John	10	38	But if I do , though you will not believe me , believe the works : that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in the Father .
DRA	John	10	39	They sought therefore to take him ; and he escaped out of their hands .
DRA	John	10	40	And he went again beyond the Jordan , into that place where John was baptizing first ; and there he abode .
DRA	John	10	41	And many resorted to him , and they said : John indeed did no sign .
DRA	John	10	42	But all things whatsoever John said of this man , were true . And many believed in him . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	11	11	These things he said ; and after that he said to them : Lazarus our friend sleepeth ; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep .

DRA	John	11	2	( And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair : whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
DRA	John	11	3	His sisters therefore sent to him , saying : Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
DRA	John	11	4	And Jesus hearing it , said to them : This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God : that the Son of God may be glorified by it .
DRA	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister Mary , and Lazarus .
DRA	John	11	6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he still remained in the same place two days .
DRA	John	11	7	Then after that , he said to his disciples : Let us go into Judea again .
DRA	John	11	8	The disciples say to him : Rabbi , the Jews but now sought to stone thee : and goest thou thither again ?
DRA	John	11	9	Jesus answered : Are there not twelve hours of the day ? If a man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world :
DRA	John	11	10	But if he walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him .
DRA	John	11	12	His disciples therefore said : Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
DRA	John	11	13	But Jesus spoke of his death ; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep .
DRA	John	11	14	Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly : Lazarus is dead .
DRA	John	11	15	And I am glad , for your sakes , that I was not there , that you may believe : but let us go to him .
DRA	John	11	16	Thomas therefore , who is called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples : Let us also go , that we may die with him .
DRA	John	11	17	Jesus therefore came , and found that he had been four days already in the grave .
DRA	John	11	18	( Now Bethania was near Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off . )
DRA	John	11	19	And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
DRA	John	11	20	Martha therefore , as soon as she heard that Jesus had come , went to meet him : but Mary sat at home .
DRA	John	11	21	Martha therefore said to Jesus : Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
DRA	John	11	22	But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
DRA	John	11	23	Jesus saith to her : Thy brother shall rise again .
DRA	John	11	24	Martha saith to him : I know that he shall rise again , in the resurrection at the last day .
DRA	John	11	25	Jesus said to her : I am the resurrection and the life : he that believeth in me , although he be dead , shall live :
DRA	John	11	26	And every one that liveth , and believeth in me , shall not die for ever . Believest thou this ?
DRA	John	11	27	She saith to him : Yea , Lord , I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God , who art come into this world .
DRA	John	11	28	And when she had said these things , she went , and called her sister Mary secretly , saying : The master is come , and calleth for thee .
DRA	John	11	29	She , as soon as she heard this , riseth quickly , and cometh to him .
DRA	John	11	30	For Jesus was not yet come into the town : but he was still in that place where Martha had met him .
DRA	John	11	31	The Jews therefore , who were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out , followed her , saying : She goeth to the grave to weep there .
DRA	John	11	32	When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was , seeing him , she fell down at his feet , and saith to him : Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
DRA	John	11	33	Jesus , therefore , when he saw her weeping , and the Jews that were come with her , weeping , groaned in the spirit , and troubled himself ,
DRA	John	11	34	And said : Where have you laid him ? They say to him : Lord , come and see .
DRA	John	11	35	And Jesus wept .
DRA	John	11	36	The Jews therefore said : Behold how he loved him .
DRA	John	11	37	But some of them said : Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind , have caused that this man should not die ?
DRA	John	11	38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself , cometh to the sepulchre . Now it was a cave ; and a stone was laid over it .
DRA	John	11	39	Jesus saith : Take away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith to him : Lord , by this time he stinketh , for he is now of four days .
DRA	John	11	40	Jesus saith to her : Did not I say to thee , that if thou believe , thou shalt see the glory of God ?
DRA	John	11	41	They took therefore the stone away . And Jesus lifting up his eyes said : Father , I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me .
DRA	John	11	42	And I knew that thou hearest me always ; but because of the people who stand about have I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
DRA	John	11	43	When he had said these things , he cried with a loud voice : Lazarus , come forth .
DRA	John	11	44	And presently he that had been dead came forth , bound feet and hands with winding bands ; and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus said to them : Loose him , and let him go .
DRA	John	11	45	Many therefore of the Jews , who were come to Mary and Martha , and had seen the things that Jesus did , believed in him .
DRA	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees , and told them the things that Jesus had done .
DRA	John	11	47	The chief priests therefore , and the Pharisees , gathered a council , and said : What do we , for this man doth many miracles ?
DRA	John	11	48	If we let him alone so , all will believe in him ; and the Romans will come , and take away our place and nation .
DRA	John	11	49	But one of them , named Caiphas , being the high priest that year , said to them : You know nothing .
DRA	John	11	50	Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
DRA	John	11	51	And this he spoke not of himself : but being the high priest of that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation .
DRA	John	11	52	And not only for the nation , but to gather together in one the children of God , that were dispersed .
DRA	John	11	53	From that day therefore they devised to put him to death .
DRA	John	11	54	Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews ; but he went into a country near the desert , unto a city that is called Ephrem , and there he abode with his disciples .
DRA	John	11	55	And the pasch of the Jews was at hand ; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem , before the pasch to purify themselves .
DRA	John	11	56	They sought therefore for Jesus ; and they discoursed one with another , standing in the temple : What think you that he is not come to the festival day ? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment , that if any man knew where he was , he should tell , that they might apprehend him .

DRA	John	12	12	And on the next day , a great multitude that was to come to the festival day , when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
DRA	John	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	12	2	And they made him a supper there : and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him .
DRA	John	12	3	Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard , of great price , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair ; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
DRA	John	12	4	Then one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , he that was about to betray him , said :
DRA	John	12	5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
DRA	John	12	6	Now he said this , not because he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and having the purse , carried the things that were put therein .
DRA	John	12	7	Jesus therefore said : Let her alone , that she may keep it against the day of my burial .
DRA	John	12	8	For the poor you have always with you ; but me you have not always .
DRA	John	12	9	A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there ; and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
DRA	John	12	10	But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also :
DRA	John	12	11	Because many of the Jews , by reason of him , went away , and believed in Jesus .
DRA	John	12	13	Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried : Hosanna , blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord , the king of Israel .
DRA	John	12	14	And Jesus found a young ass , and sat upon it , as it is written :
DRA	John	12	15	Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy king cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt .
DRA	John	12	16	These things his disciples did not know at the first ; but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things to him .
DRA	John	12	17	The multitude therefore gave testimony , which was with him , when he called Lazarus out of the grave , and raised him from the dead .
DRA	John	12	18	For which reason also the people came to meet him , because they heard that he had done this miracle .
DRA	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves : Do you see that we prevail nothing ? behold , the whole world is gone after him .
DRA	John	12	20	Now there were certain Gentiles among them , who came up to adore on the festival day .
DRA	John	12	21	These therefore came to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying : Sir , we would see Jesus .
DRA	John	12	22	Philip cometh , and telleth Andrew . Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
DRA	John	12	23	But Jesus answered them , saying : The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
DRA	John	12	24	Amen , amen I say to you , unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die ,
DRA	John	12	25	Itself remaineth alone . But if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world , keepeth it unto life eternal .
DRA	John	12	26	If any man minister to me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there also shall my minister be . If any man minister to me , him will my Father honour .
DRA	John	12	27	Now is my soul troubled . And what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour . But for this cause I came unto this hour .
DRA	John	12	28	Father , glorify thy name . A voice therefore came from heaven : I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
DRA	John	12	29	The multitude therefore that stood and heard , said that it thundered . Others said : An angel spoke to him .
DRA	John	12	30	Jesus answered , and said : This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
DRA	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of the world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
DRA	John	12	32	And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all things to myself .
DRA	John	12	33	( Now this he said , signifying what death he should die . )
DRA	John	12	34	The multitude answered him : We have heard out of the law , that Christ abideth for ever ; and how sayest thou : The Son of man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of man ?
DRA	John	12	35	Jesus therefore said to them : Yet a little while , the light is among you . Walk whilst you have the light , that the darkness overtake you not . And he that walketh in darkness , knoweth not whither he goeth .
DRA	John	12	36	Whilst you have the light , believe in the light , that you may be the children of light . These things Jesus spoke ; and he went away , and hid himself from them .
DRA	John	12	37	And whereas he had done so many miracles before them , they believed not in him :
DRA	John	12	38	That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he said : Lord , who hath believed our hearing ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
DRA	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe , because Isaias said again :
DRA	John	12	40	He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart , that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
DRA	John	12	41	These things said Isaias , when he saw his glory , and spoke of him .
DRA	John	12	42	However , many of the chief men also believed in him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , that they might not be cast out of the synagogue .
DRA	John	12	43	For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God .
DRA	John	12	44	But Jesus cried , and said : He that believeth in me , doth not believe in me , but in him that sent me .
DRA	John	12	45	And he that seeth me , seeth him that sent me .
DRA	John	12	46	I am come a light into the world ; that whosoever believeth in me , may not remain in darkness .
DRA	John	12	47	And if any man hear my words , and keep them not , I do not judge him : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
DRA	John	12	48	He that despiseth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him ; the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
DRA	John	12	49	For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father who sent me , he gave me commandment what I should say , and what I should speak .
DRA	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting . The things therefore that I speak , even as the Father said unto me , so do I speak . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	John	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	13	2	And when supper was done , ( the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to betray him , )
DRA	John	13	3	Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands , and that he came from God , and goeth to God ;
DRA	John	13	4	He riseth from supper , and layeth aside his garments , and having taken a towel , girded himself .
DRA	John	13	5	After that , he putteth water into a basin , and began to wash the feet of the disciples , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
DRA	John	13	6	He cometh therefore to Simon Peter . And Peter saith to him : Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
DRA	John	13	7	Jesus answered , and said to him : What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
DRA	John	13	8	Peter saith to him : Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him : If I wash thee not , thou shalt have no part with me .
DRA	John	13	9	Simon Peter saith to him : Lord , not only my feet , but also my hands and my head .
DRA	John	13	10	Jesus saith to him : He that is washed , needeth not but to wash his feet , but is clean wholly . And you are clean , but not all .
DRA	John	13	11	For he knew who he was that would betray him ; therefore he said : You are not all clean .
DRA	John	13	12	Then after he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , being set down again , he said to them : Know you what I have done to you ?
DRA	John	13	14	If then I being your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; you also ought to wash one another 's feet .
DRA	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that as I have done to you , so you do also .
DRA	John	13	16	Amen , amen I say to you : The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him .
DRA	John	13	17	If you know these things , you shall be blessed if you do them .
DRA	John	13	18	I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen . But that the scripture may be fulfilled : He that eateth bread with me , shall lift up his heel against me .
DRA	John	13	19	At present I tell you , before it come to pass : that when it shall come to pass , you may believe that I am he .
DRA	John	13	20	Amen , amen I say to you , he that receiveth whomsoever I send , receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me , receiveth him that sent me .
DRA	John	13	21	When Jesus had said these things , he was troubled in spirit ; and he testified , and said : Amen , amen I say to you , one of you shall betray me .
DRA	John	13	22	The disciples therefore looked one upon another , doubting of whom he spoke .
DRA	John	13	23	Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
DRA	John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , and said to him : Who is it of whom he speaketh ?
DRA	John	13	25	He therefore , leaning on the breast of Jesus , saith to him : Lord , who is it ?
DRA	John	13	26	Jesus answered : He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped . And when he had dipped the bread , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
DRA	John	13	27	And after the morsel , Satan entered into him . And Jesus said to him : That which thou dost , do quickly .
DRA	John	13	28	Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him .
DRA	John	13	29	For some thought , because Judas had the purse , that Jesus had said to him : Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day : or that he should give something to the poor .
DRA	John	13	30	He therefore having received the morsel , went out immediately . And it was night .
DRA	John	13	31	When he therefore was gone out , Jesus said : Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
DRA	John	13	32	If God be glorified in him , God also will glorify him in himself ; and immediately will he glorify him .
DRA	John	13	33	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . You shall seek me ; and as I said to the Jews : Whither I go you can not come ; so I say to you now .
DRA	John	13	34	A new commandment I give unto you : That you love one another , as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
DRA	John	13	35	By this shall all men know that you are my disciples , if you have love one for another .
DRA	John	13	36	Simon Peter saith to him : Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered : Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow hereafter .
DRA	John	13	37	Peter saith to him : Why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thee .
DRA	John	13	38	Jesus answered him : Wilt thou lay down thy life for me ? Amen , amen I say to thee , the cock shall not crow , till thou deny me thrice . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	John	14	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	14	2	In my Father 's house there are many mansions . If not , I would have told you : because I go to prepare a place for you .
DRA	John	14	3	And if I shall go , and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will take you to myself ; that where I am , you also may be .
DRA	John	14	4	And whither I go you know , and the way you know .
DRA	John	14	5	Thomas saith to him : Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ?
DRA	John	14	6	Jesus saith to him : I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No man cometh to the Father , but by me .
DRA	John	14	7	If you had known me , you would without doubt have known my Father also : and from henceforth you shall know him , and you have seen him .
DRA	John	14	8	Philip saith to him : Lord , shew us the Father , and it is enough for us .
DRA	John	14	9	Jesus saith to him : Have I been so long a time with you ; and have you not known me ? Philip , he that seeth me seeth the Father also . How sayest thou , shew us the Father ?
DRA	John	14	10	Do you not believe , that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? The words that I speak to you , I speak not of myself . But the Father who abideth in me , he doth the works .
DRA	John	14	11	Believe you not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ?
DRA	John	14	12	Otherwise believe for the very works ' sake . Amen , amen I say to you , he that believeth in me , the works that I do , he also shall do ; and greater than these shall he do .
DRA	John	14	13	Because I go to the Father : and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name , that will I do : that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
DRA	John	14	15	If you love me , keep my commandments .
DRA	John	14	16	And I will ask the Father , and he shall give you another Paraclete , that he may abide with you for ever .
DRA	John	14	17	The spirit of truth , whom the world can not receive , because it seeth him not , nor knoweth him : but you shall know him ; because he shall abide with you , and shall be in you .
DRA	John	14	18	I will not leave you orphans , I will come to you .
DRA	John	14	19	Yet a little while : and the world seeth me no more . But you see me : because I live , and you shall live .
DRA	John	14	20	In that day you shall know , that I am in my Father , and you in me , and I in you .
DRA	John	14	21	He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them ; he it is that loveth me . And he that loveth me , shall be loved of my Father : and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
DRA	John	14	22	Judas saith to him , not the Iscariot : Lord , how is it , that thou wilt manifest thyself to us , and not to the world ?
DRA	John	14	23	Jesus answered , and said to him : If any one love me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and will make our abode with him .
DRA	John	14	24	He that loveth me not , keepeth not my words . And the word which you have heard , is not mine ; but the Father 's who sent me .
DRA	John	14	25	These things have I spoken to you , abiding with you .
DRA	John	14	26	But the Paraclete , the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring all things to your mind , whatsoever I shall have said to you .
DRA	John	14	27	Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , do I give unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , nor let it be afraid .
DRA	John	14	28	You have heard that I said to you : I go away , and I come unto you . If you loved me , you would indeed be glad , because I go to the Father : for the Father is greater than I .
DRA	John	14	29	And now I have told you before it comes to pass : that when it shall come to pass , you may believe .
DRA	John	14	30	I will not now speak many things with you . For the prince of this world cometh , and in me he hath not any thing .
DRA	John	14	31	But that the world may know , that I love the Father : and as the Father hath given me commandment , so do I : Arise , let us go hence . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	15	15	I will not now call you servants : for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth . But I have called you friends : because all things whatsoever I have heard of my Father , I have made known to you .
DRA	John	15	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	15	2	Every branch in me , that beareth not fruit , he will take away : and every one that beareth fruit , he will purge it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
DRA	John	15	3	Now you are clean by reason of the word , which I have spoken to you .
DRA	John	15	4	Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , unless it abide in the vine , so neither can you , unless you abide in me .
DRA	John	15	5	I am the vine : you the branches : he that abideth in me , and I in him , the same beareth much fruit : for without me you can do nothing .
DRA	John	15	6	If any one abide not in me , he shall be cast forth as a branch , and shall wither , and they shall gather him up , and cast him into the fire , and he burneth .
DRA	John	15	7	If you abide in me , and my words abide in you , you shall ask whatever you will , and it shall be done unto you .
DRA	John	15	8	In this is my Father glorified ; that you bring forth very much fruit , and become my disciples .
DRA	John	15	9	As the Father hath loved me , I also have loved you . Abide in my love .
DRA	John	15	10	If you keep my commandments , you shall abide in my love ; as I also have kept my Father 's commandments , and do abide in his love .
DRA	John	15	11	These things I have spoken to you , that my joy may be in you , and your joy may be filled .
DRA	John	15	12	This is my commandment , that you love one another , as I have loved you .
DRA	John	15	13	Greater love than this no man hath , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
DRA	John	15	14	You are my friends , if you do the things that I command you .
DRA	John	15	16	You have not chosen me : but I have chosen you ; and have appointed you , that you should go , and should bring forth fruit ; and your fruit should remain : that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
DRA	John	15	17	These things I command you , that you love one another .
DRA	John	15	18	If the world hate you , know ye , that it hath hated me before you .
DRA	John	15	19	If you had been of the world , the world would love its own : but because you are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
DRA	John	15	20	Remember my word that I said to you : The servant is not greater than his master . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you : if they have kept my word , they will keep yours also .
DRA	John	15	21	But all these things they will do to you for my name 's sake : because they know not him who sent me .
DRA	John	15	22	If I had not come , and spoken to them , they would not have sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin .
DRA	John	15	23	He that hateth me , hateth my Father also .
DRA	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done , they would not have sin ; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father .
DRA	John	15	25	But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law : They hated me without cause .
DRA	John	15	26	But when the Paraclete cometh , whom I will send you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceedeth from the Father , he shall give testimony of me .

DRA	John	16	2	They will put you out of the synagogues : yea , the hour cometh , that whosoever killeth you , will think that he doth a service to God .
DRA	John	16	3	And these things will they do to you ; because they have not known the Father , nor me .
DRA	John	16	4	But these things I have told you , that when the hour shall come , you may remember that I told you of them .
DRA	John	16	5	But I told you not these things from the beginning , because I was with you . And now I go to him that sent me , and none of you asketh me : Whither goest thou ?
DRA	John	16	6	But because I have spoken these things to you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
DRA	John	16	7	But I tell you the truth : it is expedient to you that I go : for if I go not , the Paraclete will not come to you ; but if I go , I will send him to you .
DRA	John	16	8	And when he is come , he will convince the world of sin , and of justice , and of judgment .
DRA	John	16	9	Of sin : because they believed not in me .
DRA	John	16	10	And of justice : because I go to the Father ; and you shall see me no longer .
DRA	John	16	11	And of judgment : because the prince of this world is already judged .
DRA	John	16	12	I have yet many things to say to you : but you can not bear them now .
DRA	John	16	13	But when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will teach you all truth . For he shall not speak of himself ; but what things soever he shall hear , he shall speak ; and the things that are to come , he shall shew you .
DRA	John	16	14	He shall glorify me ; because he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it to you .
DRA	John	16	15	All things whatsoever the Father hath , are mine . Therefore I said , that he shall receive of mine , and shew it to you .
DRA	John	16	17	Then some of the disciples said one to another : What is this that he saith to us : A little while , and you shall not see me ; and again a little while , and you shall see me , and , because I go to the Father ?
DRA	John	16	18	They said therefore : What is this that he saith , A little while ? we know not what he speaketh .
DRA	John	16	19	And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him ; and he said to them : Of this do you inquire among yourselves , because I said : A little while , and you shall not see me ; and again a little while , and you shall see me ?
DRA	John	16	20	Amen , amen I say to you , that you shall lament and weep , but the world shall rejoice ; and you shall be made sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
DRA	John	16	21	A woman , when she is in labour , hath sorrow , because her hour is come ; but when she hath brought forth the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
DRA	John	16	22	So also you now indeed have sorrow ; but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice ; and your joy no man shall take from you .
DRA	John	16	23	And in that day you shall not ask me any thing . Amen , amen I say to you : if you ask the Father any thing in my name , he will give it you .
DRA	John	16	24	Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name . Ask , and you shall receive ; that your joy may be full .
DRA	John	16	25	These things I have spoken to you in proverbs . The hour cometh , when I will no more speak to you in proverbs , but will shew you plainly of the Father .
DRA	John	16	26	In that day you shall ask in my name ; and I say not to you , that I will ask the Father for you :
DRA	John	16	27	For the Father himself loveth you , because you have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
DRA	John	16	28	I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again I leave the world , and I go to the Father .
DRA	John	16	29	His disciples say to him : Behold , now thou speakest plainly , and speakest no proverb .
DRA	John	16	30	Now we know that thou knowest all things , and thou needest not that any man should ask thee . By this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
DRA	John	16	31	Jesus answered them : Do you now believe ?
DRA	John	16	32	Behold , the hour cometh , and it is now come , that you shall be scattered every man to his own , and shall leave me alone ; and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .

DRA	John	17	2	As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him .
DRA	John	17	3	Now this is eternal life : That they may know thee , the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .
DRA	John	17	4	I have glorified thee on the earth ; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
DRA	John	17	5	And now glorify thou me , O Father , with thyself , with the glory which I had , before the world was , with thee .
DRA	John	17	6	I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world . Thine they were , and to me thou gavest them ; and they have kept thy word .
DRA	John	17	7	Now they have known , that all things which thou hast given me , are from thee :
DRA	John	17	8	Because the words which thou gavest me , I have given to them ; and they have received them , and have known in very deed that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
DRA	John	17	9	I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them whom thou hast given me : because they are thine :
DRA	John	17	10	And all my things are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
DRA	John	17	11	And now I am not in the world , and these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy name whom thou has given me ; that they may be one , as we also are .
DRA	John	17	12	While I was with them , I kept them in thy name . Those whom thou gavest me have I kept ; and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition , that the scripture may be fulfilled .
DRA	John	17	13	And now I come to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy filled in themselves .
DRA	John	17	14	I have given them thy word , and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world ; as I also am not of the world .
DRA	John	17	15	I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world , but that thou shouldst keep them from evil .
DRA	John	17	16	They are not of the world , as I also am not of the world .
DRA	John	17	18	As thou hast sent me into the world , I also have sent them into the world .
DRA	John	17	19	And for them do I sanctify myself , that they also may be sanctified in truth .
DRA	John	17	20	And not for them only do I pray , but for them also who through their word shall believe in me ;
DRA	John	17	21	That they all may be one , as thou , Father , in me , and I in thee ; that they also may be one in us ; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
DRA	John	17	22	And the glory which thou hast given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , as we also are one :
DRA	John	17	23	I in them , and thou in me ; that they may be made perfect in one : and the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast also loved me .
DRA	John	17	24	Father , I will that where I am , they also whom thou hast given me may be with me ; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me , because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world .
DRA	John	17	25	Just Father , the world hath not known thee ; but I have known thee : and these have known that thou hast sent me .
DRA	John	17	26	And I have made known thy name to them , and will make it known ; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me , may be in them , and I in them . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	18	18	Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals , because it was cold , and warmed themselves . And with them was Peter also , standing , and warming himself .
DRA	John	18	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	18	2	And Judas also , who betrayed him , knew the place ; because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his disciples .
DRA	John	18	3	Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
DRA	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said to them : Whom seek ye ?
DRA	John	18	5	They answered him : Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith to them : I am he . And Judas also , who betrayed him , stood with them .
DRA	John	18	6	As soon therefore as he had said to them : I am he ; they went backward , and fell to the ground .
DRA	John	18	7	Again therefore he asked them : Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
DRA	John	18	8	Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he . If therefore you seek me , let these go their way .
DRA	John	18	9	That the word might be fulfilled which he said : Of them whom thou hast given me , I have not lost any one .
DRA	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it , and struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear . And the name of the servant was Malchus .
DRA	John	18	11	Jesus therefore said to Peter : Put up thy sword into the scabbard . The chalice which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
DRA	John	18	12	Then the band and the tribune , and the servants of the Jews , took Jesus , and bound him :
DRA	John	18	13	And they led him away to Annas first , for he was father in law to Caiphas , who was the high priest of that year .
DRA	John	18	14	Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews : That it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
DRA	John	18	15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . And that disciple was known to the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest .
DRA	John	18	16	But Peter stood at the door without . The other disciple therefore , who was known to the high priest , went out , and spoke to the portress , and brought in Peter .
DRA	John	18	17	The maid therefore that was portress , saith to Peter : Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? He saith : I am not .
DRA	John	18	19	The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
DRA	John	18	20	Jesus answered him : I have spoken openly to the world : I have always taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither all the Jews resort ; and in secret I have spoken nothing .
DRA	John	18	21	Why asketh thou me ? ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them : behold they know what things I have said .
DRA	John	18	22	And when he had said these things , one of the servants standing by , gave Jesus a blow , saying : Answerest thou the high priest so ?
DRA	John	18	23	Jesus answered him : If I have spoken evil , give testimony of the evil ; but if well , why strikest thou me ?
DRA	John	18	24	And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest .
DRA	John	18	25	And Simon Peter was standing , and warming himself . They said therefore to him : Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said : I am not .
DRA	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest ( a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off ) saith to him : Did I not see thee in the garden with him ?
DRA	John	18	27	Again therefore Peter denied ; and immediately the cock crew .
DRA	John	18	28	Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor 's hall . And it was morning ; and they went not into the hall , that they might not be defiled , but that they might eat the pasch .
DRA	John	18	29	Pilate therefore went out to them , and said : What accusation bring you against this man ?
DRA	John	18	30	They answered , and said to him : If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up to thee .
DRA	John	18	31	Pilate therefore said to them : Take him you , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said to him : It is not lawful for us to put any man to death ;
DRA	John	18	32	That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he said , signifying what death he should die .
DRA	John	18	33	Pilate therefore went into the hall again , and called Jesus , and said to him : Art thou the king of the Jews ?
DRA	John	18	34	Jesus answered : Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or have others told it thee of me ?
DRA	John	18	35	Pilate answered : Am I a Jew ? Thy own nation , and the chief priests , have delivered thee up to me : what hast thou done ?
DRA	John	18	36	Jesus answered : My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now my kingdom is not from hence .
DRA	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said to him : Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered : Thou sayest that I am a king . For this was I born , and for this came I into the world ; that I should give testimony to the truth . Every one that is of the truth , heareth my voice .
DRA	John	18	38	Pilate saith to him : What is truth ? And when he said this , he went out again to the Jews , and saith to them : I find no cause in him .
DRA	John	18	39	But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch : will you , therefore , that I release unto you the king of the Jews ?
DRA	John	18	40	Then cried they all again , saying : Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title also , and he put it upon the cross . And the writing was : JESUS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
DRA	John	19	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	19	2	And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns , put it upon his head ; and they put on him a purple garment .
DRA	John	19	3	And they came to him , and said : Hail , king of the Jews ; and they gave him blows .
DRA	John	19	4	Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith to them : Behold , I bring him forth unto you , that you may know that I find no cause in him .
DRA	John	19	5	( Jesus therefore came forth , bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . ) And he saith to them : Behold the Man .
DRA	John	19	6	When the chief priests , therefore , and the servants , had seen him , they cried out , saying : Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith to them : Take him you , and crucify him : for I find no cause in him .
DRA	John	19	7	The Jews answered him : We have a law ; and according to the law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
DRA	John	19	8	When Pilate therefore had heard this saying , he feared the more .
DRA	John	19	9	And he entered into the hall again , and he said to Jesus : Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
DRA	John	19	10	Pilate therefore saith to him : Speakest thou not to me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and I have power to release thee ?
DRA	John	19	11	Jesus answered : Thou shouldst not have any power against me , unless it were given thee from above . Therefore , he that hath delivered me to thee , hath the greater sin .
DRA	John	19	12	And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him . But the Jews cried out , saying : If thou release this man , thou art not Caesar 's friend . For whosoever maketh himself a king , speaketh against Caesar .
DRA	John	19	13	Now when Pilate had heard these words , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat , in the place that is called Lithostrotos , and in Hebrew Gabbatha .
DRA	John	19	14	And it was the parasceve of the pasch , about the sixth hour , and he saith to the Jews : Behold your king .
DRA	John	19	15	But they cried out : Away with him ; away with him ; crucify him . Pilate saith to them : Shall I crucify your king ? The chief priests answered : We have no king but Caesar .
DRA	John	19	16	Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him forth .
DRA	John	19	17	And bearing his own cross , he went forth to that place which is called Calvary , but in Hebrew Golgotha .
DRA	John	19	18	Where they crucified him , and with him two others , one on each side , and Jesus in the midst .
DRA	John	19	20	This title therefore many of the Jews did read : because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , in Greek , and in Latin .
DRA	John	19	21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate : Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am the King of the Jews .
DRA	John	19	22	Pilate answered : What I have written , I have written .
DRA	John	19	23	The soldiers therefore , when they had crucified him , took his garments , ( and they made four parts , to every soldier a part , ) and also his coat . Now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
DRA	John	19	24	They said then one to another : Let us not cut it , but let us cast lots for it , whose it shall be ; that the scripture might be fulfilled , saying : They have parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture they have cast lots . And the soldiers indeed did these things .
DRA	John	19	25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus , his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalen .
DRA	John	19	26	When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved , he saith to his mother : Woman , behold thy son .
DRA	John	19	27	After that , he saith to the disciple : Behold thy mother . And from that hour , the disciple took her to his own .
DRA	John	19	28	Afterwards , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , said : I thirst .
DRA	John	19	29	Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar . And they , putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop , put it to his mouth .
DRA	John	19	30	Jesus therefore , when he had taken the vinegar , said : It is consummated . And bowing his head , he gave up the ghost .
DRA	John	19	31	Then the Jews , ( because it was the parasceve , ) that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that was a great sabbath day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
DRA	John	19	32	The soldiers therefore came ; and they broke the legs of the first , and of the other that was crucified with him .
DRA	John	19	33	But after they were come to Jesus , when they saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
DRA	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side , and immediately there came out blood and water .
DRA	John	19	35	And he that saw it , hath given testimony , and his testimony is true . And he knoweth that he saith true ; that you also may believe .
DRA	John	19	36	For these things were done , that the scripture might be fulfilled : You shall not break a bone of him .
DRA	John	19	37	And again another scripture saith : They shall look on him whom they pierced .
DRA	John	19	38	And after these things , Joseph of Arimathea ( because he was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews ) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus . And Pilate gave leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
DRA	John	19	39	And Nicodemus also came , ( he who at the first came to Jesus by night , ) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
DRA	John	19	40	They took therefore the body of Jesus , and bound it in linen cloths , with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
DRA	John	19	41	Now there was in the place where he was crucified , a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein no man yet had been laid .
DRA	John	19	42	There , therefore , because of the parasceve of the Jews , they laid Jesus , because the sepulchre was nigh at hand . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	20	20	And when he had said this , he shewed them his hands and his side . The disciples therefore were glad , when they saw the Lord .
DRA	John	20	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	20	2	She ran , therefore , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and saith to them : They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
DRA	John	20	3	Peter therefore went out , and that other disciple , and they came to the sepulchre .
DRA	John	20	4	And they both ran together , and that other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
DRA	John	20	5	And when he stooped down , he saw the linen cloths lying ; but yet he went not in .
DRA	John	20	6	Then cometh Simon Peter , following him , and went into the sepulchre , and saw the linen cloths lying ,
DRA	John	20	7	And the napkin that had been about his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but apart , wrapped up into one place .
DRA	John	20	8	Then that other disciple also went in , who came first to the sepulchre : and he saw , and believed .
DRA	John	20	9	For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
DRA	John	20	10	The disciples therefore departed again to their home .
DRA	John	20	11	But Mary stood at the sepulchre without , weeping . Now as she was weeping , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
DRA	John	20	12	And she saw two angels in white , sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had been laid .
DRA	John	20	13	They say to her : Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith to them : Because they have taken away my Lord ; and I know not where they have laid him .
DRA	John	20	14	When she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing ; and she knew not that it was Jesus .
DRA	John	20	15	Jesus saith to her : Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , thinking it was the gardener , saith to him : Sir , if thou hast taken him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
DRA	John	20	16	Jesus saith to her : Mary . She turning , saith to him : Rabboni ( which is to say , Master ) .
DRA	John	20	17	Jesus saith to her : Do not touch me , for I am not yet ascended to my Father . But go to my brethren , and say to them : I ascend to my Father and to your Father , to my God and your God .
DRA	John	20	18	Mary Magdalen cometh , and telleth the disciples : I have seen the Lord , and these things he said to me .
DRA	John	20	19	Now when it was late that same day , the first of the week , and the doors were shut , where the disciples were gathered together , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and said to them : Peace be to you .
DRA	John	20	21	He said therefore to them again : Peace be to you . As the Father hath sent me , I also send you .
DRA	John	20	22	When he had said this , he breathed on them ; and he said to them : Receive ye the Holy Ghost .
DRA	John	20	23	Whose sins you shall forgive , they are forgiven them ; and whose sins you shall retain , they are retained .
DRA	John	20	24	Now Thomas , one of the twelve , who is called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
DRA	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said to him : We have seen the Lord . But he said to them : Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the place of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe .
DRA	John	20	26	And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them . Jesus cometh , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said : Peace be to you .
DRA	John	20	27	Then he saith to Thomas : Put in thy finger hither , and see my hands ; and bring hither thy hand , and put it into my side ; and be not faithless , but believing .
DRA	John	20	28	Thomas answered , and said to him : My Lord , and my God .
DRA	John	20	29	Jesus saith to him : Because thou hast seen me , Thomas , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and have believed .
DRA	John	20	30	Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his disciples , which are not written in this book .
DRA	John	20	31	But these are written , that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God : and that believing , you may have life in his name . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	John	21	21	Him therefore when Peter had seen , he saith to Jesus : Lord , and what shall this man do ?
DRA	John	21	1899	American Edition
DRA	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas , who is called Didymus , and Nathanael , who was of Cana of Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples .
DRA	John	21	3	Simon Peter saith to them : I go a fishing . They say to him : We also come with thee . And they went forth , and entered into the ship : and that night they caught nothing .
DRA	John	21	4	But when the morning was come , Jesus stood on the shore : yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
DRA	John	21	5	Jesus therefore said to them : Children , have you any meat ? They answered him : No .
DRA	John	21	6	He saith to them : Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and you shall find . They cast therefore ; and now they were not able to draw it , for the multitude of fishes .
DRA	John	21	7	That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved , said to Peter : It is the Lord . Simon Peter , when he heard that it was the Lord , girt his coat about him , ( for he was naked , ) and cast himself into the sea .
DRA	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the ship , ( for they were not far from the land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
DRA	John	21	9	As soon then as they came to land , they saw hot coals lying , and a fish laid thereon , and bread .
DRA	John	21	10	Jesus saith to them : Bring hither of the fishes which you have now caught .
DRA	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fishes , one hundred and fifty-three . And although there were so many , the net was not broken .
DRA	John	21	12	Jesus saith to them : Come , and dine . And none of them who were at meat , durst ask him : Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
DRA	John	21	13	And Jesus cometh and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish in like manner .
DRA	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples , after he was risen from the dead .
DRA	John	21	15	When therefore they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter : Simon son of John , lovest thou me more than these ? He saith to him : Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee . He saith to him : Feed my lambs .
DRA	John	21	16	He saith to him again : Simon , son of John , lovest thou me ? He saith to him : Yea , Lord , thou knowest that I love thee . He saith to him : Feed my lambs .
DRA	John	21	17	He said to him the third time : Simon , son of John , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved , because he had said to him the third time : Lovest thou me ? And he said to him : Lord , thou knowest all things : thou knowest that I love thee . He said to him : Feed my sheep .
DRA	John	21	18	Amen , amen I say to thee , when thou wast younger , thou didst gird thyself , and didst walk where thou wouldst . But when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and lead thee whither thou wouldst not .
DRA	John	21	19	And this he said , signifying by what death he should glorify God . And when he had said this , he saith to him : Follow me .
DRA	John	21	20	Peter turning about , saw that disciple whom Jesus loved following , who also leaned on his breast at supper , and said : Lord , who is he that shall betray thee ?
DRA	John	21	22	Jesus saith to him : So I will have him to remain till I come , what is it to thee ? follow thou me .
DRA	John	21	23	This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die . And Jesus did not say to him : He should not die ; but , So I will have him to remain till I come , what is it to thee ?
DRA	John	21	24	This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things , and hath written these things ; and we know that his testimony is true .
DRA	John	21	25	But there are also many other things which Jesus did ; which , if they were written every one , the world itself , I think , would not be able to contain the books that should be written . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	1	1	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
DRA	Romans	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	1	2	Which he had promised before , by his prophets , in the holy scriptures ,
DRA	Romans	1	3	Concerning his Son , who was made to him of the seed of David , according to the flesh ,
DRA	Romans	1	4	Who was predestinated the Son of God in power , according to the spirit of sanctification , by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead ;
DRA	Romans	1	5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith , in all nations , for his name ;
DRA	Romans	1	6	Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ :
DRA	Romans	1	7	To all that are at Rome , the beloved of God , called to be saints . Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	Romans	1	8	First I give thanks to my God , through Jesus Christ , for you all , because your faith is spoken of in the whole world .
DRA	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make a commemoration of you ;
DRA	Romans	1	10	Always in my prayers making request , if by any means now at length I may have a prosperous journey , by the will of God , to come unto you .
DRA	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace , to strengthen you :
DRA	Romans	1	12	That is to say , that I may be comforted together in you , by that which is common to us both , your faith and mine .
DRA	Romans	1	13	And I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that I have often purposed to come unto you , ( and have been hindered hitherto , ) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
DRA	Romans	1	14	To the Greeks and to the barbarians , to the wise and to the unwise , I am a debtor ;
DRA	Romans	1	15	So ( as much as is in me ) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome .
DRA	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel . For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth , to the Jew first , and to the Greek .
DRA	Romans	1	17	For the justice of God is revealed therein , from faith unto faith , as it is written : The just man liveth by faith .
DRA	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice :
DRA	Romans	1	19	Because that which is known of God is manifest in them . For God hath manifested it unto them .
DRA	Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him , from the creation of the world , are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made ; his eternal power also , and divinity : so that they are inexcusable .
DRA	Romans	1	21	Because that , when they knew God , they have not glorified him as God , or given thanks ; but became vain in their thoughts , and their foolish heart was darkened .
DRA	Romans	1	22	For professing themselves to be wise , they became fools .
DRA	Romans	1	23	And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man , and of birds , and of fourfooted beasts , and of creeping things .
DRA	Romans	1	24	Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart , unto uncleanness , to dishonour their own bodies among themselves .
DRA	Romans	1	25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie ; and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
DRA	Romans	1	26	For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections . For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature .
DRA	Romans	1	27	And , in like manner , the men also , leaving the natural use of the women , have burned in their lusts one towards another , men with men working that which is filthy , and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error .
DRA	Romans	1	28	And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge , God delivered them up to a reprobate sense , to do those things which are not convenient ;
DRA	Romans	1	29	Being filled with all iniquity , malice , fornication , avarice , wickedness , full of envy , murder , contention , deceit , malignity , whisperers ,
DRA	Romans	1	30	Detractors , hateful to God , contumelious , proud , haughty , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
DRA	Romans	1	31	Foolish , dissolute , without affection , without fidelity , without mercy .
DRA	Romans	1	32	Who , having known the justice of God , did not understand that they who do such things , are worthy of death ; and not only they that do them , but they also that consent to them that do them . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	2	2	For we know that the judgment of God is , according to truth , against them that do such things .
DRA	Romans	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them who do such things , and dost the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
DRA	Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness , and patience , and longsuffering ? Knowest thou not , that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance ?
DRA	Romans	2	5	But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart , thou treasurest up to thyself wrath , against the day of wrath , and revelation of the just judgment of God .
DRA	Romans	2	6	Who will render to every man according to his works .
DRA	Romans	2	7	To them indeed , who according to patience in good work , seek glory and honour and incorruption , eternal life :
DRA	Romans	2	8	But to them that are contentious , and who obey not the truth , but give credit to iniquity , wrath and indignation .
DRA	Romans	2	9	Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil , of the Jew first , and also of the Greek .
DRA	Romans	2	10	But glory , and honour , and peace to every one that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
DRA	Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God .
DRA	Romans	2	12	For whosoever have sinned without the law , shall perish without the law ; and whosoever have sinned in the law , shall be judged by the law .
DRA	Romans	2	13	For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
DRA	Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles , who have not the law , do by nature those things that are of the law ; these having not the law are a law to themselves :
DRA	Romans	2	15	Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience bearing witness to them , and their thoughts between themselves accusing , or also defending one another ,
DRA	Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ , according to my gospel .
DRA	Romans	2	17	But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
DRA	Romans	2	18	And knowest his will , and approvest the more profitable things , being instructed by the law ,
DRA	Romans	2	19	Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them that are in darkness ,
DRA	Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish , a teacher of infants , having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law .
DRA	Romans	2	21	Thou therefore that teachest another , teachest not thyself : thou that preachest that men should not steal , stealest :
DRA	Romans	2	22	Thou that sayest , men should not commit adultery , committest adultery : thou that abhorrest idols , committest sacrilege :
DRA	Romans	2	23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law , by transgression of the law dishonourest God .
DRA	Romans	2	24	( For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles , as it is written . )
DRA	Romans	2	25	Circumcision profiteth indeed , if thou keep the law ; but if thou be a transgressor of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
DRA	Romans	2	26	If , then , the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law , shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
DRA	Romans	2	27	And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision , if it fulfill the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law ?
DRA	Romans	2	28	For it is not he is a Jew , who is so outwardly ; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh :
DRA	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew , that is one inwardly ; and the circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit , not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	3	3	For what if some of them have not believed ? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect ? God forbid .
DRA	Romans	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	3	2	Much every way . First indeed , because the words of God were committed to them .
DRA	Romans	3	4	But God is true ; and every man a liar , as it is written , That thou mayest be justified in thy words , and mayest overcome when thou art judged .
DRA	Romans	3	5	But if our injustice commend the justice of God , what shall we say ? Is God unjust , who executeth wrath ?
DRA	Romans	3	6	( I speak according to man . ) God forbid : otherwise how shall God judge this world ?
DRA	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie , unto his glory , why am I also yet judged as a sinner ?
DRA	Romans	3	8	And not rather ( as we are slandered , and as some affirm that we say ) let us do evil , that there may come good ? whose damnation is just .
DRA	Romans	3	9	What then ? Do we excel them ? No , not so . For we have charged both Jews , and Greeks , that they are all under sin .
DRA	Romans	3	10	As it is written : There is not any man just .
DRA	Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
DRA	Romans	3	12	All have turned out of the way ; they are become unprofitable together : there is none that doth good , there is not so much as one .
DRA	Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully . The venom of asps is under their lips .
DRA	Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness :
DRA	Romans	3	15	Their feet swift to shed blood :
DRA	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery in their ways :
DRA	Romans	3	17	And the way of peace they have not known :
DRA	Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes .
DRA	Romans	3	19	Now we know , that what things soever the law speaketh , it speaketh to them that are in the law ; that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may be made subject to God .
DRA	Romans	3	20	Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him . For by the law is the knowledge of sin .
DRA	Romans	3	21	But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest , being witnessed by the law and the prophets .
DRA	Romans	3	22	Even the justice of God , by faith of Jesus Christ , unto all and upon all them that believe in him : for there is no distinction :
DRA	Romans	3	23	For all have sinned , and do need the glory of God .
DRA	Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace , through the redemption , that is in Christ Jesus ,
DRA	Romans	3	25	Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation , through faith in his blood , to the shewing of his justice , for the remission of former sins ,
DRA	Romans	3	26	Through the forbearance of God , for the shewing of his justice in this time ; that he himself may be just , and the justifier of him , who is of the faith of Jesus Christ .
DRA	Romans	3	27	Where is then thy boasting ? It is excluded . By what law ? Of works ? No , but by the law of faith .
DRA	Romans	3	28	For we account a man to be justified by faith , without the works of the law .
DRA	Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only ? Is he not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also .
DRA	Romans	3	30	For it is one God , that justifieth circumcision by faith , and uncircumcision through faith .
DRA	Romans	3	31	Do we , then , destroy the law through faith ? God forbid : but we establish the law . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh , the reward is not reckoned according to grace , but according to debt .
DRA	Romans	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath whereof to glory , but not before God .
DRA	Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture ? Abraham believed God , and it was reputed to him unto justice .
DRA	Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not , yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is reputed to justice , according to the purpose of the grace of God .
DRA	Romans	4	6	As David also termeth the blessedness of a man , to whom God reputeth justice without works :
DRA	Romans	4	7	Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
DRA	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin .
DRA	Romans	4	9	This blessedness then , doth it remain in the circumcision only , or in the uncircumcision also ? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice .
DRA	Romans	4	10	How then was it reputed ? When he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
DRA	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the justice of the faith , which he had , being uncircumcised ; that he might be the father of all them that believe , being uncircumcised , that unto them also it may be reputed to justice :
DRA	Romans	4	12	And might be the father of circumcision ; not to them only , that are of the circumcision , but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful , that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham .
DRA	Romans	4	13	For not through the law was the promise to Abraham , or to his seed , that he should be heir of the world ; but through the justice of faith .
DRA	Romans	4	14	For if they who are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , the promise is made of no effect .
DRA	Romans	4	15	For the law worketh wrath . For where there is no law , neither is there transgression .
DRA	Romans	4	16	Therefore is it of faith , that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all ,
DRA	Romans	4	17	( As it is written : I have made thee a father of many nations , ) before God , whom he believed , who quickeneth the dead ; and calleth those things that are not , as those that are .
DRA	Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope ; that he might be made the father of many nations , according to that which was said to him : So shall thy seed be .
DRA	Romans	4	19	And he was not weak in faith ; neither did he consider his own body now dead , whereas he was almost an hundred years old , nor the dead womb of Sara .
DRA	Romans	4	20	In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust ; but was strengthened in faith , giving glory to God :
DRA	Romans	4	21	Most fully knowing , that whatsoever he has promised , he is able also to perform .
DRA	Romans	4	22	And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice .
DRA	Romans	4	23	Now it is not written only for him , that it was reputed to him unto justice ,
DRA	Romans	4	24	But also for us , to whom it shall be reputed , if we believe in him , that raised up Jesus Christ , our Lord , from the dead ,
DRA	Romans	4	25	Who was delivered up for our sins , and rose again for our justification . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	5	5	And hope confoundeth not : because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts , by the Holy Ghost , who is given to us .
DRA	Romans	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access through faith into this grace , wherein we stand , and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God .
DRA	Romans	5	3	And not only so ; but we glory also in tribulations , knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
DRA	Romans	5	4	And patience trial ; and trial hope ;
DRA	Romans	5	6	For why did Christ , when as yet we were weak , according to the time , die for the ungodly ?
DRA	Romans	5	7	For scarce for a just man will one die ; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die .
DRA	Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his charity towards us ; because when as yet we were sinners , according to the time ,
DRA	Romans	5	9	Christ died for us ; much more therefore , being now justified by his blood , shall we be saved from wrath through him .
DRA	Romans	5	10	For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son ; much more , being reconciled , shall we be saved by his life .
DRA	Romans	5	11	And not only so ; but also we glory in God , through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received reconciliation .
DRA	Romans	5	12	Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world , and by sin death ; and so death passed upon all men , in whom all have sinned .
DRA	Romans	5	13	For until the law sin was in the world ; but sin was not imputed , when the law was not .
DRA	Romans	5	14	But death reigned from Adam unto Moses , even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam , who is a figure of him who was to come .
DRA	Romans	5	15	But not as the offence , so also the gift . For if by the offence of one , many died ; much more the grace of God , and the gift , by the grace of one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
DRA	Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one sin , so also is the gift . For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation ; but grace is of many offences , unto justification .
DRA	Romans	5	17	For if by one man 's offence death reigned through one ; much more they who receive abundance of grace , and of the gift , and of justice , shall reign in life through one , Jesus Christ .
DRA	Romans	5	18	Therefore , as by the offence of one , unto all men to condemnation ; so also by the justice of one , unto all men to justification of life .
DRA	Romans	5	19	For as by the disobedience of one man , many were made sinners ; so also by the obedience of one , many shall be made just .
DRA	Romans	5	20	Now the law entered in , that sin might abound . And where sin abounded , grace did more abound .
DRA	Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned to death ; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting , through Jesus Christ our Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	6	6	Knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin may be destroyed , to the end that we may serve sin no longer .
DRA	Romans	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	6	2	God forbid . For we that are dead to sin , how shall we live any longer therein ?
DRA	Romans	6	3	Know you not that all we , who are baptized in Christ Jesus , are baptized in his death ?
DRA	Romans	6	4	For we are buried together with him by baptism into death ; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father , so we also may walk in newness of life .
DRA	Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection .
DRA	Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is justified from sin .
DRA	Romans	6	8	Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall live also together with Christ :
DRA	Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead , dieth now no more , death shall no more have dominion over him .
DRA	Romans	6	10	For in that he died to sin , he died once ; but in that he liveth , he liveth unto God :
DRA	Romans	6	11	So do you also reckon , that you are dead to sin , but alive unto God , in Christ Jesus our Lord .
DRA	Romans	6	12	Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body , so as to obey the lusts thereof .
DRA	Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin ; but present yourselves to God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of justice unto God .
DRA	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you ; for you are not under the law , but under grace .
DRA	Romans	6	15	What then ? Shall we sin , because we are not under the law , but under grace ? God forbid .
DRA	Romans	6	16	Know you not , that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey , his servants you are whom you obey , whether it be of sin unto death , or of obedience unto justice .
DRA	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God , that you were the servants of sin , but have obeyed from the heart , unto that form of doctrine , into which you have been delivered .
DRA	Romans	6	18	Being then freed from sin , we have been made servants of justice .
DRA	Romans	6	19	I speak an human thing , because of the infirmity of your flesh . For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity , unto iniquity ; so now yield your members to serve justice , unto sanctification .
DRA	Romans	6	20	For when you were the servants of sin , you were free men to justice .
DRA	Romans	6	21	What fruit therefore had you then in those things , of which you are now ashamed ? For the end of them is death .
DRA	Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , you have your fruit unto sanctification , and the end life everlasting .
DRA	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death . But the grace of God , life everlasting , in Christ Jesus our Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	7	7	What shall we say , then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid . But I do not know sin , but by the law ; for I had not known concupiscence , if the law did not say : Thou shalt not covet .
DRA	Romans	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	7	2	For the woman that hath an husband , whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law . But if her husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
DRA	Romans	7	3	Therefore , whilst her husband liveth , she shall be called an adulteress , if she be with another man : but if her husband be dead , she is delivered from the law of her husband ; so that she is not an adulteress , if she be with another man .
DRA	Romans	7	4	Therefore , my brethren , you also are become dead to the law , by the body of Christ ; that you may belong to another , who is risen again from the dead , that we may bring forth fruit to God .
DRA	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , the passions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members , to bring forth fruit unto death .
DRA	Romans	7	6	But now we are loosed from the law of death , wherein we were detained ; so that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
DRA	Romans	7	8	But sin taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence . For without the law sin was dead .
DRA	Romans	7	9	And I lived some time without the law . But when the commandment came , sin revived ,
DRA	Romans	7	10	And I died . And the commandment that was ordained to life , the same was found to be unto death to me .
DRA	Romans	7	11	For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , seduced me , and by it killed me .
DRA	Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law indeed is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
DRA	Romans	7	13	Was that then which is good , made death unto me ? God forbid . But sin , that it may appear sin , by that which is good , wrought death in me ; that sin , by the commandment , might become sinful above measure .
DRA	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual ; but I am carnal , sold under sin .
DRA	Romans	7	15	For that which I work , I understand not . For I do not that good which I will ; but the evil which I hate , that I do .
DRA	Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I will not , I consent to the law , that it is good .
DRA	Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
DRA	Romans	7	18	For I know that there dwelleth not in me , that is to say , in my flesh , that which is good . For to will , is present with me ; but to accomplish that which is good , I find not .
DRA	Romans	7	19	For the good which I will , I do not ; but the evil which I will not , that I do .
DRA	Romans	7	20	Now if I do that which I will not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
DRA	Romans	7	21	I find then a law , that when I have a will to do good , evil is present with me .
DRA	Romans	7	22	For I am delighted with the law of God , according to the inward man :
DRA	Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members , fighting against the law of my mind , and captivating me in the law of sin , that is in my members .
DRA	Romans	7	24	Unhappy man that I am , who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
DRA	Romans	7	25	The grace of God , by Jesus Christ our Lord . Therefore , I myself , with the mind serve the law of God ; but with the flesh , the law of sin . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	8	8	And they who are in the flesh , can not please God .
DRA	Romans	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	8	2	For the law of the spirit of life , in Christ Jesus , hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death .
DRA	Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh ; God sending his own Son , in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin , hath condemned sin in the flesh ;
DRA	Romans	8	4	That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not according to the flesh , but according to the spirit .
DRA	Romans	8	5	For they that are according to the flesh , mind the things that are of the flesh ; but they that are according to the spirit , mind the things that are of the spirit .
DRA	Romans	8	6	For the wisdom of the flesh is death ; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace .
DRA	Romans	8	7	Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God ; for it is not subject to the law of God , neither can it be .
DRA	Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh , but in the spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
DRA	Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you , the body indeed is dead , because of sin ; but the spirit liveth , because of justification .
DRA	Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead , dwell in you ; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead , shall quicken also your mortal bodies , because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
DRA	Romans	8	12	Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
DRA	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh , you shall die : but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh , you shall live .
DRA	Romans	8	14	For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
DRA	Romans	8	15	For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear ; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons , whereby we cry : Abba ( Father ) .
DRA	Romans	8	16	For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit , that we are the sons of God .
DRA	Romans	8	17	And if sons , heirs also ; heirs indeed of God , and joint heirs with Christ : yet so , if we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified with him .
DRA	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come , that shall be revealed in us .
DRA	Romans	8	19	For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God .
DRA	Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him that made it subject , in hope :
DRA	Romans	8	21	Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption , into the liberty of the glory of the children of God .
DRA	Romans	8	22	For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain , even till now .
DRA	Romans	8	23	And not only it , but ourselves also , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption of the sons of God , the redemption of our body .
DRA	Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope . But hope that is seen , is not hope . For what a man seeth , why doth he hope for ?
DRA	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that which we see not , we wait for it with patience .
DRA	Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity . For we know not what we should pray for as we ought ; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings .
DRA	Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts , knoweth what the Spirit desireth ; because he asketh for the saints according to God .
DRA	Romans	8	28	And we know that to them that love God , all things work together unto good , to such as , according to his purpose , are called to be saints .
DRA	Romans	8	29	For whom he foreknew , he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son ; that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren .
DRA	Romans	8	30	And whom he predestinated , them he also called . And whom he called , them he also justified . And whom he justified , them he also glorified .
DRA	Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things ? If God be for us , who is against us ?
DRA	Romans	8	32	He that spared not even his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how hath he not also , with him , given us all things ?
DRA	Romans	8	33	Who shall accuse against the elect of God ? God that justifieth .
DRA	Romans	8	34	Who is he that shall condemn ? Christ Jesus that died , yea that is risen also again ; who is at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
DRA	Romans	8	35	Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation ? or distress ? or famine ? or nakedness ? or danger ? or persecution ? or the sword ?
DRA	Romans	8	36	( As it is written : For thy sake we are put to death all the day long . We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter . )
DRA	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we overcome , because of him that hath loved us .
DRA	Romans	8	38	For I am sure that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come , nor might ,
DRA	Romans	8	39	Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise : According to this time will I come ; and Sara shall have a son .
DRA	Romans	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	9	2	That I have great sadness , and continual sorrow in my heart .
DRA	Romans	9	3	For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ , for my brethren , who are my kinsmen according to the flesh ,
DRA	Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites , to whom belongeth the adoption as of children , and the glory , and the testament , and the giving of the law , and the service of God , and the promises :
DRA	Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers , and of whom is Christ , according to the flesh , who is over all things , God blessed for ever . Amen .
DRA	Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath miscarried . For all are not Israelites that are of Israel :
DRA	Romans	9	7	Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham , children ; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called :
DRA	Romans	9	8	That is to say , not they that are the children of the flesh , are the children of God ; but they , that are the children of the promise , are accounted for the seed .
DRA	Romans	9	10	And not only she . But when Rebecca also had conceived at once , of Isaac our father .
DRA	Romans	9	11	For when the children were not yet born , nor had done any good or evil ( that the purpose of God , according to election , might stand , )
DRA	Romans	9	12	Not of works , but of him that calleth , it was said to her : The elder shall serve the younger .
DRA	Romans	9	13	As it is written : Jacob I have loved , but Esau I have hated .
DRA	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? Is there injustice with God ? God forbid .
DRA	Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses : I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy ; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy .
DRA	Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
DRA	Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith to Pharao : To this purpose have I raised thee , that I may shew my power in thee , and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
DRA	Romans	9	18	Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will ; and whom he will , he hardeneth .
DRA	Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say therefore to me : Why doth he then find fault ? for who resisteth his will ?
DRA	Romans	9	20	O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it : Why hast thou made me thus ?
DRA	Romans	9	21	Or hath not the potter power over the clay , of the same lump , to make one vessel unto honour , and another unto dishonour ?
DRA	Romans	9	22	What if God , willing to shew his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath , fitted for destruction ,
DRA	Romans	9	23	That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which he hath prepared unto glory ?
DRA	Romans	9	24	Even us , whom also he hath called , nor only of the Jews , but also of the Gentiles .
DRA	Romans	9	25	As in Osee he saith : I will call that which was not my people , my people ; and her that was not beloved , beloved ; and her that had not obtained mercy , one that hath obtained mercy .
DRA	Romans	9	26	And it shall be , in the place where it was said unto them , You are not my people ; there they shall be called the sons of the living God .
DRA	Romans	9	27	And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel : If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved .
DRA	Romans	9	28	For he shall finish his word , and cut it short in justice ; because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth .
DRA	Romans	9	29	And as Isaias foretold : Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , we had been made as Sodom , and we had been like unto Gomorrha .
DRA	Romans	9	30	What then shall we say ? That the Gentiles , who followed not after justice , have attained to justice , even the justice that is of faith .
DRA	Romans	9	31	But Israel , by following after the law of justice , is not come unto the law of justice .
DRA	Romans	9	32	Why so ? Because they sought it not by faith , but as it were of works . For they stumbled at the stumblingstone .
DRA	Romans	9	33	As it is written : Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a rock of scandal ; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	10	10	For , with the heart , we believe unto justice ; but , with the mouth , confession is made unto salvation .
DRA	Romans	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	10	2	For I bear them witness , that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge .
DRA	Romans	10	3	For they , not knowing the justice of God , and seeking to establish their own , have not submitted themselves to the justice of God .
DRA	Romans	10	4	For the end of the law is Christ , unto justice to every one that believeth .
DRA	Romans	10	5	For Moses wrote , that the justice which is of the law , the man that shall do it , shall live by it .
DRA	Romans	10	6	But the justice which is of faith , speaketh thus : Say not in thy heart , Who shall ascend into heaven ? that is , to bring Christ down ;
DRA	Romans	10	7	Or who shall descend into the deep ? that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead .
DRA	Romans	10	8	But what saith the scripture ? The word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart . This is the word of faith , which we preach .
DRA	Romans	10	9	For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
DRA	Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith : Whosoever believeth in him , shall not be confounded .
DRA	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek : for the same is Lord over all , rich unto all that call upon him .
DRA	Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord , shall be saved .
DRA	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him , in whom they have not believed ? Or how shall they believe him , of whom they have not heard ? And how shall they hear , without a preacher ?
DRA	Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach unless they be sent , as it is written : How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , of them that bring glad tidings of good things !
DRA	Romans	10	16	But all do not obey the gospel . For Isaias saith : Lord , who hath believed our report ?
DRA	Romans	10	17	Faith then cometh by hearing ; and hearing by the word of Christ .
DRA	Romans	10	18	But I say : Have they not heard ? Yes , verily , their sound hath gone forth into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the whole world .
DRA	Romans	10	19	But I say : Hath not Israel known ? First , Moses saith : I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation ; by a foolish nation I will anger you .
DRA	Romans	10	20	But Isaias is bold , and saith : I was found by them that did not seek me : I appeared openly to them that asked not after me .
DRA	Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith : All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not , and contradicteth me . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	11	11	I say then , have they so stumbled , that they should fall ? God forbid . But by their offence , salvation is come to the Gentiles , that they may be emulous of them .
DRA	Romans	11	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people , which he foreknew . Know you not what the scripture saith of Elias ; how he calleth on God against Israel ?
DRA	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have slain thy prophets , they have dug down thy altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
DRA	Romans	11	4	But what saith the divine answer to him ? I have left me seven thousand men , that have not bowed their knees to Baal .
DRA	Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also , there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace .
DRA	Romans	11	6	And if by grace , it is not now by works : otherwise grace is no more grace .
DRA	Romans	11	7	What then ? That which Israel sought , he hath not obtained : but the election hath obtained it ; and the rest have been blinded .
DRA	Romans	11	8	As it is written : God hath given them the spirit of insensibility ; eyes that they should not see ; and ears that they should not hear , until this present day .
DRA	Romans	11	9	And David saith : Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumbling block , and a recompense unto them .
DRA	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see : and bow down their back always .
DRA	Romans	11	12	Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world , and the diminution of them , the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more the fulness of them ?
DRA	Romans	11	13	For I say to you , Gentiles : as long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles , I will honour my ministry ,
DRA	Romans	11	14	If , by any means , I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh , and may save some of them .
DRA	Romans	11	15	For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
DRA	Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy , so is the lump also : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
DRA	Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken , and thou , being a wild olive , art ingrafted in them , and art made partaker of the root , and of the fatness of the olive tree ,
DRA	Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches . But if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
DRA	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then : The branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in .
DRA	Romans	11	20	Well : because of unbelief they were broken off . But thou standest by faith : be not highminded , but fear .
DRA	Romans	11	21	For if God hath not spared the natural branches , fear lest perhaps he also spare not thee .
DRA	Romans	11	22	See then the goodness and the severity of God : towards them indeed that are fallen , the severity ; but towards thee , the goodness of God , if thou abide in goodness , otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
DRA	Romans	11	23	And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be grafted in : for God is able to graft them in again .
DRA	Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree , which is natural to thee ; and , contrary to nature , were grafted into the good olive tree ; how much more shall they that are the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
DRA	Romans	11	25	For I would not have you ignorant , brethren , of this mystery , ( lest you should be wise in your own conceits ) , that blindness in part has happened in Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in .
DRA	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel should be saved , as it is written : There shall come out of Sion , he that shall deliver , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
DRA	Romans	11	27	And this is to them my covenant : when I shall take away their sins .
DRA	Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel , indeed , they are enemies for your sake : but as touching the election , they are most dear for the sake of the fathers .
DRA	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance .
DRA	Romans	11	30	For as you also in times past did not believe God , but now have obtained mercy , through their unbelief ;
DRA	Romans	11	31	So these also now have not believed , for your mercy , that they also may obtain mercy .
DRA	Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded all in unbelief , that he may have mercy on all .
DRA	Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God ! How incomprehensible are his judgments , and how unsearchable his ways !
DRA	Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord ? Or who hath been his counsellor ?
DRA	Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him , and recompense shall be made him ?
DRA	Romans	11	36	For of him , and by him , and in him , are all things : to him be glory for ever . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	12	12	Rejoicing in hope . Patient in tribulation . Instant in prayer .
DRA	Romans	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world ; but be reformed in the newness of your mind , that you may prove what is the good , and the acceptable , and the perfect will of God .
DRA	Romans	12	3	For I say , by the grace that is given me , to all that are among you , not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise , but to be wise unto sobriety , and according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith .
DRA	Romans	12	4	For as in one body we have many members , but all the members have not the same office :
DRA	Romans	12	5	So we being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
DRA	Romans	12	6	And having different gifts , according to the grace that is given us , either prophecy , to be used according to the rule of faith ;
DRA	Romans	12	7	Or ministry , in ministering ; or he that teacheth , in doctrine ;
DRA	Romans	12	8	He that exhorteth , in exhorting ; he that giveth , with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with carefulness ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
DRA	Romans	12	9	Let love be without dissimulation . Hating that which is evil , cleaving to that which is good .
DRA	Romans	12	10	Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood , with honour preventing one another .
DRA	Romans	12	11	In carefulness not slothful . In spirit fervent . Serving the Lord .
DRA	Romans	12	13	Communicating to the necessities of the saints . Pursuing hospitality .
DRA	Romans	12	14	Bless them that persecute you : bless , and curse not .
DRA	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with them that rejoice ; weep with them that weep .
DRA	Romans	12	16	Being of one mind one towards another . Not minding high things , but consenting to the humble . Be not wise in your own conceits .
DRA	Romans	12	17	To no man rendering evil for evil . Providing good things , not only in the sight of God , but also in the sight of all men .
DRA	Romans	12	18	If it be possible , as much as is in you , have peace with all men .
DRA	Romans	12	19	Revenge not yourselves , my dearly beloved ; but give place unto wrath , for it is written : Revenge is mine , I will repay , saith the Lord .
DRA	Romans	12	20	But if thy enemy be hungry , give him to eat ; if he thirst , give him to drink . For , doing this , thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head .

DRA	Romans	13	13	Let us walk honestly , as in the day : not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and impurities , not in contention and envy :
DRA	Romans	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	13	2	Therefore he that resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . And they that resist , purchase to themselves damnation .
DRA	Romans	13	3	For princes are not a terror to the good work , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? Do that which is good : and thou shalt have praise from the same .
DRA	Romans	13	4	For he is God 's minister to thee , for good . But if thou do that which is evil , fear : for he beareth not the sword in vain . For he is God 's minister : an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil .
DRA	Romans	13	5	Wherefore be subject of necessity , not only for wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
DRA	Romans	13	6	For therefore also you pay tribute . For they are the ministers of God , serving unto this purpose .
DRA	Romans	13	7	Render therefore to all men their dues . Tribute , to whom tribute is due : custom , to whom custom : fear , to whom fear : honour , to whom honour .
DRA	Romans	13	8	Owe no man any thing , but to love one another . For he that loveth his neighbour , hath fulfilled the law .
DRA	Romans	13	9	For Thou shalt not commit adultery : Thou shalt not kill : Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness : Thou shalt not covet : and if there be any other commandment , it is comprised in this word , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
DRA	Romans	13	10	The love of our neighbour worketh no evil . Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law .
DRA	Romans	13	11	And that knowing the season ; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep . For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed .
DRA	Romans	13	12	The night is passed , and the day is at hand . Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and put on the armour of light .
DRA	Romans	13	14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	14	14	I know , and am confident in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean of itself ; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
DRA	Romans	14	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things : but he that is weak , let him eat herbs .
DRA	Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth , despise him that eateth not : and he that eateth not , let him not judge him that eateth . For God hath taken him to him .
DRA	Romans	14	4	Who art thou that judgest another man 's servant ? To his own lord he standeth or falleth . And he shall stand : for God is able to make him stand .
DRA	Romans	14	5	For one judgeth between day and day : and another judgeth every day : let every man abound in his own sense .
DRA	Romans	14	6	He that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord . And he that eateth , eateth to the Lord : for he giveth thanks to God . And he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not , and giveth thanks to God .
DRA	Romans	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself ; and no man dieth to himself .
DRA	Romans	14	8	For whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; or whether we die , we die unto the Lord . Therefore , whether we live , or whether we die , we are the Lord 's .
DRA	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ died and rose again ; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living .
DRA	Romans	14	10	But thou , why judgest thou thy brother ? or thou , why dost thou despise thy brother ? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
DRA	Romans	14	11	For it is written : As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
DRA	Romans	14	12	Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself .
DRA	Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more . But judge this rather , that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother 's way .
DRA	Romans	14	15	For if , because of thy meat , thy brother be grieved , thou walkest not now according to charity . Destroy not him with thy meat , for whom Christ died .
DRA	Romans	14	16	Let not then our good be evil spoken of .
DRA	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but justice , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
DRA	Romans	14	18	For he that in this serveth Christ , pleaseth God , and is approved of men .
DRA	Romans	14	19	Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace ; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another .
DRA	Romans	14	20	Destroy not the work of God for meat . All things indeed are clean : but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
DRA	Romans	14	21	It is good not to eat flesh , and not to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended , or scandalized , or made weak .
DRA	Romans	14	22	Hast thou faith ? Have it to thyself before God . Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth .
DRA	Romans	14	23	But he that discerneth , if he eat , is condemned ; because not of faith . For all that is not of faith is sin . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Romans	15	15	But I have written to you , brethren , more boldly in some sort , as it were putting you in mind : because of the grace which is given me from God .
DRA	Romans	15	1899	American Edition
DRA	Romans	15	2	Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good , to edification .
DRA	Romans	15	3	For Christ did not please himself , but as it is written : The reproaches of them that reproached thee , fell upon me .
DRA	Romans	15	4	For what things soever were written , were written for our learning : that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures , we might have hope .
DRA	Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards another , according to Jesus Christ :
DRA	Romans	15	6	That with one mind , and with one mouth , you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive one another , as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God .
DRA	Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers .
DRA	Romans	15	9	But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy , as it is written : Therefore will I confess to thee , O Lord , among the Gentiles , and will sing to thy name .
DRA	Romans	15	10	And again he saith : Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with his people .
DRA	Romans	15	11	And again : Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and magnify him , all ye people .
DRA	Romans	15	12	And again Isaias saith : There shall be a root of Jesse ; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles , in him the Gentiles shall hope .
DRA	Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing ; that you may abound in hope , and in the power of the Holy Ghost .
DRA	Romans	15	14	And I myself also , my brethren , am assured of you , that you also are full of love , replenished with all knowledge , so that you are able to admonish one another .
DRA	Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles ; sanctifying the gospel of God , that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost .
DRA	Romans	15	17	I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God .
DRA	Romans	15	18	For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me , for the obedience of the Gentiles , by word and deed ,
DRA	Romans	15	19	By the virtue of signs and wonders , in the power of the Holy Ghost , so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum , I have replenished the gospel of Christ .
DRA	Romans	15	20	And I have so preached this gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation .
DRA	Romans	15	21	But as it is written : They to whom he was not spoken of , shall see , and they that have not heard shall understand .
DRA	Romans	15	22	For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you , and have been kept away till now .
DRA	Romans	15	23	But now having no more place in these countries , and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you ,
DRA	Romans	15	24	When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain , I hope that as I pass , I shall see you , and be brought on my way thither by you , if first , in part , I shall have enjoyed you :
DRA	Romans	15	25	But now I shall go to Jerusalem , to minister unto the saints .
DRA	Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem .
DRA	Romans	15	27	For it hath pleased them ; and they are their debtors . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , they ought also in carnal things to minister to them .
DRA	Romans	15	28	When therefore I shall have accomplished this , and consigned to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
DRA	Romans	15	29	And I know , that when I come to you , I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
DRA	Romans	15	30	I beseech you therefore , brethren , through our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the charity of the Holy Ghost , that you help me in your prayers for me to God ,
DRA	Romans	15	31	That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea , and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints .
DRA	Romans	15	32	That I may come to you with joy , by the will of God , and may be refreshed with you .
DRA	Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Romans	16	2	That you receive her in the Lord as becometh saints ; and that you assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of you . For she also hath assisted many , and myself also .
DRA	Romans	16	3	Salute Prisca and Aquila , my helpers in Christ Jesus ,
DRA	Romans	16	4	( Who have for my life laid down their own necks : to whom not I only give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles , )
DRA	Romans	16	5	And the church which is in their house . Salute Epenetus , my beloved : who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ .
DRA	Romans	16	6	Salute Mary , who hath laboured much among you .
DRA	Romans	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junias , my kinsmen and fellow prisoners : who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .

DRA	Romans	16	11	Salute them that are of Aristobulus ' household . Salute Herodian , my kinsman . Salute them that are of Narcissus ' household , who are in the Lord .
DRA	Romans	16	12	Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa , who labour in the Lord . Salute Persis , the dearly beloved , who hath much laboured in the Lord .
DRA	Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus , elect in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
DRA	Romans	16	14	Salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brethren that are with them .
DRA	Romans	16	15	Salute Philologus and Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympias ; and all the saints that are with them .
DRA	Romans	16	17	Now I beseech you , brethren , to mark them who make dissensions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned , and avoid them .
DRA	Romans	16	18	For they that are such , serve not Christ our Lord , but their own belly ; and by pleasing speeches and good words , seduce the hearts of the innocent .
DRA	Romans	16	19	For your obedience is published in every place . I rejoice therefore in you . But I would have you to be wise in good , and simple in evil .
DRA	Romans	16	20	And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .

DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Sosthenes a brother ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	2	To the church of God that is at Corinth , to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , in every place of theirs and ours .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I give thanks to my God always for you , for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	5	That in all things you are made rich in him , in all utterance , and in all knowledge ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	6	As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	7	So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace , waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	8	Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime , in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful : by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing , and that there be no schisms among you ; but that you be perfect in the same mind , and in the same judgment .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been signified unto me , my brethren , of you , by them that are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say , that every one of you saith : I indeed am of Paul ; and I am of Apollo ; and I am of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided ? Was Paul then crucified for you ? or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I give God thanks , that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanus ; besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not in wisdom of speech , lest the cross of Christ should be made void .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the word of the cross , to them indeed that perish , is foolishness ; but to them that are saved , that is , to us , it is the power of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written : I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and the prudence of the prudent I will reject .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the disputer of this world ? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world , by wisdom , knew not God , it pleased God , by the foolishness of our preaching , to save them that believe .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For both the Jews require signs , and the Greeks seek after wisdom :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified , unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock , and unto the Gentiles foolishness :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But unto them that are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For see your vocation , brethren , that there are not many wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen , that he may confound the wise ; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen , that he may confound the strong .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And the base things of the world , and the things that are contemptible , hath God chosen , and things that are not , that he might bring to nought things that are :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his sight .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But of him are you in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and justice , and sanctification , and redemption :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	1	31	That , as it is written : He that glorieth , may glory in the Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I judged not myself to know anything among you , but Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom , but in shewing of the Spirit and power ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	5	That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men , but on the power of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , neither of the princes of this world that come to nought ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , a wisdom which is hidden , which God ordained before the world , unto our glory :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew ; for if they had known it , they would never have crucified the Lord of glory .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But , as it is written : That eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither hath it entered into the heart of man , what things God hath prepared for them that love him .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But to us God hath revealed them , by this Spirit . For the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man , but the spirit of a man that is in him ? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth , but the Spirit of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received not the spirit of this world , but the Spirit that is of God ; that we may know the things that are given us from God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak , not in the learned words of human wisdom ; but in the doctrine of the Spirit , comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God ; for it is foolishness to him , and he can not understand , because it is spiritually examined .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But the spiritual man judgeth all things ; and he himself is judged of no man .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord , that we may instruct him ? But we have the mind of Christ . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	3	For , whereas there is among you envying and contention , are you not carnal , and walk according to man ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink , not meat ; for you were not able as yet . But neither indeed are you now able ; for you are yet carnal .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith , I indeed am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollo ; are you not men ? What then is Apollo , and what is Paul ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	5	The ministers of him whom you have believed ; and to every one as the Lord hath given .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I have planted , Apollo watered , but God gave the increase .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	7	Therefore , neither he that planteth is any thing , nor he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth , and he that watereth , are one . And every man shall receive his own reward , according to his own labour .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God 's coadjutors : you are God 's husbandry ; you are God 's building .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God that is given to me , as a wise architect , I have laid the foundation ; and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation no man can lay , but that which is laid ; which is Christ Jesus .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation , gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	13	Every man 's work shall be manifest ; for the day of the Lord shall declare it , because it shall be revealed in fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work , of what sort it is .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any man 's work abide , which he hath built thereupon , he shall receive a reward .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man 's work burn , he shall suffer loss ; but he himself shall be saved , yet so as by fire .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Know you not , that you are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	17	But if any man violate the temple of God , him shall God destroy . For the temple of God is holy , which you are .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself : if any man among you seem to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written : I will catch the wise in their own craftiness .

DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge not before the time ; until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts ; and then shall every man have praise from God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	6	But these things , brethren , I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo , for your sakes ; that in us you may learn , that one be not puffed up against the other for another , above that which is written .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	8	You are now full ; you are now become rich ; you reign without us ; and I would to God you did reign , that we also might reign with you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us apostles , the last , as it were men appointed to death : we are made a spectacle to the world , and to angels , and to men .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ 's sake , but you are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but you are strong ; you are honourable , but we without honour .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no fixed abode ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	12	And we labour , working with our own hands : we are reviled , and we bless ; we are persecuted , and we suffer it .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	13	We are blasphemed , and we entreat ; we are made as the refuse of this world , the offscouring of all even until now .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to confound you ; but I admonish you as my dearest children .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet not many fathers . For in Christ Jesus , by the gospel , I have begotten you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore I beseech you , be ye followers of me , as I also am of Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent to you Timothy , who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord ; who will put you in mind of my ways , which are in Christ Jesus ; as I teach everywhere in every church .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	18	As if I would not come to you , so some are puffed up .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will : and will know , not the speech of them that are puffed up , but the power .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in speech , but in power .

DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you are puffed up ; and have not rather mourned , that he might be taken away from among you , that hath done this deed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	3	I indeed , absent in body , but present in spirit , have already judged , as though I were present , him that hath so done ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good . Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Purge out the old leaven , that you may be a new paste , as you are unleavened . For Christ our pasch is sacrificed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us feast , not with the old leaven , nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in an epistle , not to keep company with fornicators .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	10	I mean not with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or the extortioners , or the servers of idols ; otherwise you must needs go out of this world .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written to you , not to keep company , if any man that is named a brother , be a fornicator , or covetous , or a server of idols , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner : with such a one , not so much as to eat .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them that are without ? Do not you judge them that are within ?

DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother , and that before unbelievers .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Know you not that the saints shall judge this world ? And if the world shall be judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Know you not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things of this world ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world , set them to judge , who are the most despised in the church .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame . Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man , that is able to judge between his brethren ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you , that you have lawsuits one with another . Why do you not rather take wrong ? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But you do wrong and defraud , and that to your brethren .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God ? Do not err : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	10	Nor the effeminate , nor liers with mankind , nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor railers , nor extortioners , shall possess the kingdom of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such some of you were ; but you are washed , but you are sanctified , but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the Spirit of our God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful to me , but all things are not expedient . All things are lawful to me , but I will not be brought under the power of any .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Meat for the belly , and the belly for the meats ; but God shall destroy both it and them : but the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	14	Now God hath both raised up the Lord , and will raise us up also by his power .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Or know you not , that he who is joined to a harlot , is made one body ? For they shall be , saith he , two in one flesh .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But he who is joined to the Lord , is one spirit .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Fly fornication . Every sin that a man doth , is without the body ; but he that committeth fornication , sinneth against his own body .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Or know you not , that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost , who is in you , whom you have from God ; and you are not your own ?

DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as myself : but every one hath his proper gift from God ; one after this manner , and another after that .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But for fear of fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render the debt to his wife , and the wife also in like manner to the husband .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband . And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud not one another , except , perhaps , by consent , for a time , that you may give yourselves to prayer ; and return together again , lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by indulgence , not by commandment .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	8	But I say to the unmarried , and to the widows : It is good for them if they so continue , even as I .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they do not contain themselves , let them marry . For it is better to marry than to be burnt .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	10	But to them that are married , not I but the Lord commandeth , that the wife depart not from her husband .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	11	And if she depart , that she remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband . And let not the husband put away his wife .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	12	For to the rest I speak , not the Lord . If any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she consent to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not , and he consent to dwell with her , let her not put away her husband .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife ; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband : otherwise your children should be unclean ; but now they are holy .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever depart , let him depart . For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases . But God hath called us in peace .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? Or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But as the Lord hath distributed to every one , as God hath called every one , so let him walk : and so in all churches I teach .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called , being circumcised ? let him not procure uncircumcision . Is any man called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing : but the observance of the commandments of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Wast thou called , being a bondman ? care not for it ; but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord , being a bondman , is the freeman of the Lord . Likewise he that is called , being free , is the bondman of Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You are bought with a price ; be not made the bondslaves of men .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brethren , let every man , wherein he was called , therein abide with God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins , I have no commandment of the Lord ; but I give counsel , as having obtained mercy of the Lord , to be faithful .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity , that it is good for a man so to be .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound to a wife ? seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if thou take a wife , thou hast not sinned . And if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned : nevertheless , such shall have tribulation of the flesh . But I spare you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	29	This therefore I say , brethren ; the time is short ; it remaineth , that they also who have wives , be as if they had none ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as if they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world , as if they used it not : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you to be without solicitude . He that is without a wife , is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But he that is with a wife , is solicitous for the things of the world , how he may please his wife : and he is divided .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	34	And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your profit : not to cast a snare upon you ; but for that which is decent , and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord , without impediment .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured , with regard to his virgin , for that she is above the age , and it must so be : let him do what he will ; he sinneth not , if she marry .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	37	For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart , having no necessity , but having power of his own will ; and hath judged this in his heart , to keep his virgin , doth well .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	38	Therefore , both he that giveth his virgin in marriage , doth well ; and he that giveth her not , doth better .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband die , she is at liberty : let her marry to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But more blessed shall she be , if she so remain , according to my counsel ; and I think that I also have the spirit of God . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But meat doth not commend us to God . For neither , if we eat , shall we have the more ; nor , if we eat not , shall we have the less .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing , he hath not yet known as he ought to know .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God , the same is known by him .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	4	But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no God but one .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For although there be that are called gods , either in heaven or on earth ( for there be gods many , and lords many ) ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	6	Yet to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we unto him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But there is not knowledge in every one . For some until this present , with conscience of the idol : eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol 's temple , shall not his conscience , being weak , be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom Christ hath died ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	12	Now when you sin thus against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore , if meat scandalize my brother , I will never eat flesh , lest I should scandalize my brother . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	2	And if unto others I be not an apostle , but yet to you I am . For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defence with them that do examine me is this .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Have not we power to eat and to drink ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to carry about a woman , a sister , as well as the rest of the apostles , and the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power to do this ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who serveth as a soldier at any time , at his own charges ? Who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? Who feedeth the flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Speak I these things according to man ? Or doth not the law also say these things ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes ? For these things are written for our sakes : that he that plougheth , should plough in hope ; and he that thrasheth , in hope to receive fruit .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you , why not we rather ? Nevertheless , we have not used this power : but we bear all things , lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Know you not , that they who work in the holy place , eat the things that are of the holy place ; and they that serve the altar , partake with the altar ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	14	So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel , should live by the gospel .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things . Neither have I written these things , that they should be so done unto me : for it is good for me to die , rather than that any man should make my glory void .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I preach the gospel , it is no glory to me , for a necessity lieth upon me : for woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation is committed to me :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then ? That preaching the gospel , I may deliver the gospel without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For whereas I was free as to all , I made myself the servant of all , that I might gain the more .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	20	And I became to the Jews , a Jew , that I might gain the Jews :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To them that are under the law , as if I were under the law , ( whereas myself was not under the law , ) that I might gain them that were under the law . To them that were without the law , as if I were without the law , ( whereas I was not without the law of God , but was in the law of Christ , ) that I might gain them that were without the law .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak , that I might gain the weak . I became all things to all men , that I might save all .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And I do all things for the gospel 's sake : that I may be made partaker thereof .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Know you not that they that run in the race , all run indeed , but one receiveth the prize ? So run that you may obtain .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And every one that striveth for the mastery , refraineth himself from all things : and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible one .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run , not as at an uncertainty : I so fight , not as one beating the air :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I chastise my body , and bring it into subjection : lest perhaps , when I have preached to others , I myself should become a castaway . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	2	And all in Moses were baptized , in the cloud , and in the sea :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual food ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	4	And all drank the same spiritual drink ; ( and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ . )
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But with most of them God was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the desert .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were done in a figure of us , that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither become ye idolaters , as some of them , as it is written : The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed fornication , and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ : as some of them tempted , and perished by the serpents .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened to them in figure : and they are written for our correction , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand , let him take heed lest he fall .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	13	Let no temptation take hold on you , but such as is human . And God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able : but will make also with temptation issue , that you may be able to bear it .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore , my dearly beloved , fly from the service of idols .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men : judge ye yourselves what I say .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The chalice of benediction , which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread , which we break , is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For we , being many , are one bread , one body , all that partake of one bread .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel according to the flesh : are not they , that eat of the sacrifices , partakers of the altar ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What then ? Do I say , that what is offered in sacrifice to idols , is any thing ? Or , that the idol is any thing ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But the things which the heathens sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God . And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You can not drink the chalice of the Lord , and the chalice of devils : you can not be partakers of the table of the Lord , and of the table of devils .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ? All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me , but all things do not edify .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own , but that which is another 's .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , eat ; asking no question for conscience ' sake .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	26	The earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not , invite you , and you will be willing to go ; eat of any thing that is set before you , asking no question for conscience ' sake .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say : This has been sacrificed to idols , do not eat of it for his sake that told it , and for conscience ' sake .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	29	Conscience , I say , not thy own , but the other 's . For why is my liberty judged by another man 's conscience ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thanksgiving , why am I evil spoken of , for that for which I give thanks ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Therefore , whether you eat or drink , or whatsoever else you do , do all to the glory of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Be without offence to the Jews , and to the Gentiles , and to the church of God :

DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you , brethren , that in all things you are mindful of me : and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered , disgraceth his head .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered , disgraceth her head : for it is all one as if she were shaven .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman be not covered , let her be shorn . But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald , let her cover her head .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	7	The man indeed ought not to cover his head , because he is the image and glory of God ; but the woman is the glory of the man .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman , but the woman of the man .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	9	For the man was not created for the woman , but the woman for the man .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	10	Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head , because of the angels .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man , so also is the man by the woman : but all things of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	13	You yourselves judge : doth it become a woman , to pray unto God uncovered ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you , that a man indeed , if he nourish his hair , it is a shame unto him ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman nourish her hair , it is a glory to her ; for her hair is given to her for a covering .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , nor the church of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now this I ordain : not praising you , that you come together not for the better , but for the worse .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church , there are schisms among you ; and in part I believe it .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies : that they also , who are approved , may be made manifest among you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When you come therefore together into one place , it is not now to eat the Lord 's supper .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For every one taketh before his own supper to eat . And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What , have you not houses to eat and to drink in ? Or despise ye the church of God ; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you ? Do I praise you ? In this I praise you not .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , that the Lord Jesus , the same night in which he was betrayed , took bread .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	24	And giving thanks , broke , and said : Take ye , and eat : this is my body , which shall be delivered for you : this do for the commemoration of me .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In like manner also the chalice , after he had supped , saying : This chalice is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as often as you shall drink , for the commemoration of me .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you shall eat this bread , and drink the chalice , you shall shew the death of the Lord , until he come .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread , or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a man prove himself : and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of the chalice .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh judgment to himself , not discerning the body of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	30	Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you , and many sleep .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But whilst we are judged , we are chastised by the Lord , that we be not condemned with this world .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore , my brethren , when you come together to eat , wait for one another .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If any man be hungry , let him eat at home ; that you come not together unto judgment . And the rest I will set in order , when I come . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one , and hath many members ; and all the members of the body , whereas they are many , yet are one body , so also is Christ .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were heathens , you went to dumb idols , according as you were led .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man , speaking by the Spirit of God , saith Anathema to Jesus . And no man can say the Lord Jesus , but by the Holy Ghost .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of graces , but the same Spirit ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are diversities of ministries , but the same Lord ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations , but the same God , who worketh all in all .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	7	And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	8	To one indeed , by the Spirit , is given the word of wisdom : and to another , the word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	9	To another , faith in the same spirit ; to another , the grace of healing in one Spirit ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	10	To another , the working of miracles ; to another , prophecy ; to another , the discerning of spirits ; to another , diverse kinds of tongues ; to another , interpretation of speeches .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh , dividing to every one according as he will .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Gentiles , whether bond or free ; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body also is not one member , but many .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say , because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say , because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were the eye , where would be the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where would be the smelling ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they all were one member , where would be the body ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now there are many members indeed , yet one body .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say to the hand : I need not thy help ; nor again the head to the feet : I have no need of you .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Yea , much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body , are more necessary .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body , about these we put more abundant honour ; and those that are our uncomely parts , have more abundant comeliness .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	24	But our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	25	That there might be no schism in the body ; but the members might be mutually careful one for another .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffer any thing , all the members suffer with it ; or if one member glory , all the members rejoice with it .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ , and members of member .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God indeed hath set some in the church ; first apostles , secondly prophets , thirdly doctors ; after that miracles ; then the graces of healing , helps , governments , kinds of tongues , interpretations of speeches .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all doctors ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Are all workers of miracles ? Have all the grace of healing ? Do all speak with tongues ? Do all interpret ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But be zealous for the better gifts . And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now there remain faith , hope , and charity , these three : but the greatest of these is charity . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries , and all knowledge , and if I should have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor , and if I should deliver my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Charity is patient , is kind : charity envieth not , dealeth not perversely ; is not puffed up ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	5	Is not ambitious , seeketh not her own , is not provoked to anger , thinketh no evil ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth with the truth ;
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Charity never falleth away : whether prophecies shall be made void , or tongues shall cease , or knowledge shall be destroyed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come , that which is in part shall be done away .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child . But , when I became a man , I put away the things of a child .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	13	12	We see now through a glass in a dark manner ; but then face to face . Now I know in part ; but then I shall know even as I am known .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is without fruit .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in a tongue , speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man heareth . Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth , speaketh to men unto edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in a tongue , edifieth himself : but he that prophesieth , edifieth the church .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	5	And I would have you all to speak with tongues , but rather to prophesy . For greater is he that prophesieth , than he that speaketh with tongues : unless perhaps he interpret , that the church may receive edification .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now , brethren , if I come to you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , unless I speak to you either in revelation , or in knowledge , or in prophecy , or in doctrine ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Even things without life that give sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction of sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So likewise you , except you utter by the tongue plain speech , how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , for example , so many kinds of tongues in this world ; and none is without voice .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	11	If then I know not the power of the voice , I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian ; and he that speaketh , a barbarian to me .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	12	So you also , forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits , seek to abound unto the edifying of the church .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	13	And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue , let him pray that he may interpret .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , I will pray also with the understanding ; I will sing with the spirit , I will sing also with the understanding .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say , Amen , to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For thou indeed givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God I speak with all your tongues .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	19	But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that I may instruct others also ; than ten thousand words in a tongue .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , do not become children in sense : but in malice be children , and in sense be perfect .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written : In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people ; and neither so will they hear me , saith the Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to believers , but to unbelievers ; but prophecies not to unbelievers , but to believers .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in unlearned persons or infidels , will they not say that you are mad ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or an unlearned person , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	25	The secrets of his heart are made manifest ; and so , falling down on his face , he will adore God , affirming that God is among you indeed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	26	How is it then , brethren ? When you come together , every one of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a revelation , hath a tongue , hath an interpretation : let all things be done to edification .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any speak with a tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and in course , and let one interpret .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter , let him hold his peace in the church , and speak to himself and to God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	29	And let the prophets speak , two or three ; and let the rest judge .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if any thing be revealed to another sitting , let the first hold his peace .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you may all prophesy one by one ; that all may learn , and all may be exhorted :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the God of dissension , but of peace : as also I teach in all the churches of the saints .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Let women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted them to speak , but to be subject , as also the law saith .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	35	But if they would learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home . For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If any seem to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him know the things that I write to you , that they are the commandments of the Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if any man know not , he shall not be known .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore , brethren , be zealous to prophesy ; and forbid not to speak with tongues .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	14	40	But let all things be done decently , and according to order . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God : because we have given testimony against God , that he hath raised up Christ ; whom he hath not raised up , if the dead rise not again .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	2	By which also you are saved , if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you , unless you have believed in vain .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all , which I also received : how that Christ died for our sins , according to the scriptures :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day , according to the scriptures :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen by Cephas ; and after that by the eleven .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	6	Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once : of whom many remain until this present , and some are fallen asleep .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that , he was seen by James , then by all the apostles .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all , he was seen also by me , as by one born out of due time .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles , who am not worthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God , I am what I am ; and his grace in me hath not been void , but I have laboured more abundantly than all they : yet not I , but the grace of God with me .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	11	For whether I , or they , so we preach , and so you have believed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached , that he arose again from the dead , how do some among you say , that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then Christ is not risen again .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen again , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not again , neither is Christ risen again .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not risen again , your faith is vain , for you are yet in your sins .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ , are perished .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ is risen from the dead , the firstfruits of them that sleep :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For by a man came death , and by a man the resurrection of the dead .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	22	And as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all shall be made alive .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But every one in his own order : the firstfruits Christ , then they that are of Christ , who have believed in his coming .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Afterwards the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father , when he shall have brought to nought all principality , and power , and virtue .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign , until he hath put all his enemies under his feet .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	26	And the enemy death shall be destroyed last : For he hath put all things under his feet . And whereas he saith ,
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	27	All things are put under him ; undoubtedly , he is excepted , who put all things under him .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him , then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not again at all ? why are they then baptized for them ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	30	Why also are we in danger every hour ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I die daily , I protest by your glory , brethren , which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If ( according to man ) I fought with beasts at Ephesus , what doth it profit me , if the dead rise not again ? Let us eat and drink , for to morrow we shall die .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not seduced : Evil communications corrupt good manners .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake , ye just , and sin not . For some have not the knowledge of God , I speak it to your shame .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say : How do the dead rise again ? or with what manner of body shall they come ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Senseless man , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die first .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest , thou sowest not the body that shall be ; but bare grain , as of wheat , or of some of the rest .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as he will : and to every seed its proper body .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh : but one is the flesh of men , another of beasts , another of birds , another of fishes .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	40	And there are bodies celestial , and bodies terrestrial : but , one is the glory of the celestial , and another of the terrestrial .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	41	One is the glory of the sun , another the glory of the moon , and another the glory of the stars . For star differeth from star in glory .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption , it shall rise in incorruption .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour , it shall rise in glory . It is sown in weakness , it shall rise in power .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body , it shall rise a spiritual body . If there be a natural body , there is also a spiritual body , as it is written :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	45	The first man Adam was made into a living soul ; the last Adam into a quickening spirit .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	46	Yet that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; afterwards that which is spiritual .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man was of the earth , earthly : the second man , from heaven , heavenly .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	48	Such as is the earthly , such also are the earthly : and such as is the heavenly , such also are they that are heavenly .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly , let us bear also the image of the heavenly .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not possess the kingdom of God : neither shall corruption possess incorruption .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a mystery . We shall all indeed rise again : but we shall not all be changed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	52	In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall rise again incorruptible : and we shall be changed .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption ; and this mortal must put on immortality .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	54	And when this mortal hath put on immortality , then shall come to pass the saying that is written : Death is swallowed up in victory .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	55	O death , where is thy victory ? O death , where is thy sting ?
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Now the sting of death is sin : and the power of sin is the law .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .

DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with himself , laying up what it shall well please him ; that when I come , the collections be not then to be made .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I shall be with you , whomsoever you shall approve by letters , them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I also go , they shall go with me .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come to you , when I shall have passed through Macedonia . For I shall pass through Macedonia .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	6	And with you perhaps I shall abide , or even spend the winter : that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way , for I trust that I shall abide with you some time , if the Lord permit .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and evident is opened unto me : and many adversaries .

DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him , but conduct ye him on his way in peace : that he may come to me . For I look for him with the brethren .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	12	And touching our brother Apollo , I give you to understand , that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren : and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time . But he will come when he shall have leisure .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , do manfully , and be strengthened .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done in charity .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	15	And I beseech you , brethren , you know the house of Stephanas , and of Fortunatus , and of Achaicus , that they are the firstfruits of Achaia , and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints :
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	17	And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas , and Fortunatus , and Achaicus , because that which was wanting on your part , they have supplied .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours . Know them , therefore , that are such .
DRA	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house , with whom I also lodge .

DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation ; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress , by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us : so also by Christ doth our comfort abound .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	6	Now whether we be in tribulation , it is for your exhortation and salvation : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation : or whether we be exhorted , it is for your exhortation and salvation , which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	7	That our hope for you may be steadfast : knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings , so shall you be also of the consolation .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we would not have you ignorant , brethren , of our tribulation , which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure above our strength , so that we were weary even of life .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we had in ourselves the answer of death , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raiseth the dead .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	10	Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers : in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us .

DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our glory is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God , and not in carnal wisdom , but in the grace of God , we have conversed in this world : and more abundantly towards you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known . And I hope that you shall know unto the end :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	14	As also you have known us in part , that we are your glory , as you also are ours , in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before , that you might have a second grace :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Whereas then I was thus minded , did I use lightness ? Or , the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that there should be with me , It is , and It is not ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But God is faithful , for our preaching which was to you , was not , It is , and It is not .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us , by me , and Sylvanus , and Timothy , was not , It is and It is not , but , It is , was in him .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God are in him , It is ; therefore also by him , amen to God , unto our glory .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ , and that hath anointed us , is God :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	22	Who also hath sealed us , and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But I call God to witness upon my soul , that to spare you , I came not any more to Corinth : not because we exercise dominion over your faith : but we are helpers of your joy : for in faith you stand . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorrowful , who is he then that can make me glad , but the same who is made sorrowful by me ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same to you ; that I may not , when I come , have sorrow upon sorrow , from them of whom I ought to rejoice : having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart , I wrote to you with many tears : not that you should be made sorrowful : but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	5	And if any one have caused grief , he hath not grieved me ; but in part , that I may not burden you all .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	6	To him who is such a one , this rebuke is sufficient , which is given by many :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	7	So that on the contrary , you should rather forgive him and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore , I beseech you , that you would confirm your charity towards him .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write , that I may know the experiment of you , whether you be obedient in all things .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	10	And to whom you have pardoned any thing , I also . For , what I have pardoned , if I have pardoned any thing , for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	11	That we be not overreached by Satan . For we are not ignorant of his devices .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	12	And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ , and a door was opened unto me in the Lord ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother ; but bidding them farewell , I went into Macedonia .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be to God , who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus , and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are the good odour of Christ unto God , in them that are saved , and in them that perish .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To the one indeed the odour of death unto death : but to the others the odour of life unto life . And for these things who is so sufficient ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many , adulterating the word of God ; but with sincerity , but as from God , before God , in Christ we speak . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	2	You are our epistle , written in our hearts , which is known and read by all men :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	3	Being manifested , that you are the epistle of Christ , ministered by us , and written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in the fleshly tables of the heart .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such confidence we have , through Christ , towards God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves , as of ourselves : but our sufficiency is from God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament , not in the letter , but in the spirit . For the letter killeth , but the spirit quickeneth .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	7	Now if the ministration of death , engraven with letters upon stones , was glorious ; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses , for the glory of his countenance , which is made void :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is in glory .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Having therefore such hope , we use much confidence :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses put a veil upon his face , that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their senses were made dull . For , until this present day , the selfsame veil , in the reading of the old testament , remaineth not taken away ( because in Christ it is made void ) .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But even until this day , when Moses is read , the veil is upon their heart .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when they shall be converted to the Lord , the veil shall be taken away .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is a Spirit . And where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , as by the Spirit of the Lord . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	2	But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor adulterating the word of God ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience , in the sight of God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers , that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not shine unto them .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	3	And if our gospel be also hid , it is hid to them that are lost ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves , but Jesus Christ our Lord ; and ourselves your servants through Jesus .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God , in the face of Christ Jesus .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency may be of the power of God , and not of us .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	8	In all things we suffer tribulation , but are not distressed ; we are straitened , but are not destitute ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We suffer persecution , but are not forsaken ; we are cast down , but we perish not :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus , that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake ; that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	13	But having the same spirit of faith , as it is written : I believed , for which cause I have spoken ; we also believe , for which cause we speak also :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he who raised up Jesus , will raise us up also with Jesus , and place us with you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes ; that the grace abounding through many , may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not ; but though our outward man is corrupted , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation , worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen . For the things which are seen , are temporal ; but the things which are not seen , are eternal . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	2	For in this also we groan , desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now he that maketh us for this very thing , is God , who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	3	Yet so that we be found clothed , not naked .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For we also , who are in this tabernacle , do groan , being burthened ; because we would not be unclothed , but clothed upon , that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore having always confidence , knowing that , while we are in the body , we are absent from the Lord .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	7	( For we walk by faith , and not by sight . )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	8	But we are confident , and have a good will to be absent rather from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	9	And therefore we labour , whether absent or present , to please him .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ , that every one may receive the proper things of the body , according as he hath done , whether it be good or evil .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we use persuasion to men ; but to God we are manifest . And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We commend not ourselves again to you , but give you occasion to glory in our behalf ; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face , and not in heart .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be transported in mind , it is to God ; or whether we be sober , it is for you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the charity of Christ presseth us : judging this , that if one died for all , then all were dead .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And Christ died for all ; that they also who live , may not now live to themselves , but unto him who died for them , and rose again .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth , we know no man according to the flesh . And if we have known Christ according to the flesh ; but now we know him so no longer .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	17	If then any be in Christ a new creature , the old things are passed away , behold all things are made new .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	18	But all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	19	For God indeed was in Christ , reconciling the world to himself , not imputing to them their sins ; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	20	For Christ therefore we are ambassadors , God as it were exhorting by us . For Christ , we beseech you , be reconciled to God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	5	21	Him , who knew no sin , he hath made sin for us , that we might be made the justice of God in him . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	2	For he saith : In an accepted time have I heard thee ; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee . Behold , now is the acceptable time ; behold , now is the day of salvation .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	6	In chastity , in knowledge , in longsuffering , in sweetness , in the Holy Ghost , in charity unfeigned ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence to any man , that our ministry be not blamed :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God , in much patience , in tribulation , in necessities , in distresses ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	5	In stripes , in prisons , in seditions , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	7	In the word of truth , in the power of God ; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report ; as deceivers , and yet true ; as unknown , and yet known ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	9	As dying , and behold we live ; as chastised , and not killed ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful , yet always rejoicing ; as needy , yet enriching many ; as having nothing , and possessing all things .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	11	Our mouth is open to you , O ye Corinthians , our heart is enlarged .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	12	You are not straitened in us , but in your own bowels you are straitened .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	13	But having the same recompense , ( I speak as to my children , ) be you also enlarged .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Bear not the yoke with unbelievers . For what participation hath justice with injustice ? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? For you are the temple of the living God ; as God saith : I will dwell in them , and walk among them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore , Go out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the Lord , and touch not the unclean thing :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	6	18	And I will receive you ; and I will be a Father to you ; and you shall be my sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Receive us . We have injured no man , we have corrupted no man , we have overreached no man .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only , but also by the consolation , wherewith he was comforted in you , relating to us your desire , your mourning , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced the more .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to your condemnation . For we have said before , that you are in our hearts , to die together , and to live together .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my confidence for you , great is my glorying for you . I am filled with comfort : I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For also when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we suffered all tribulation ; combats without , fears within .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who comforteth the humble , comforted us by the coming of Titus .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle , I do not repent ; and if I did repent , seeing that the same epistle ( although but for a time ) did make you sorrowful ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I am glad : not because you were made sorrowful ; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance . For you were made sorrowful according to God , that you might suffer damage by us in nothing .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance , steadfast unto salvation ; but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing , that you were made sorrowful according to God , how great carefulness it worketh in you ; yea defence , yea indignation , yea fear , yea desire , yea zeal , yea revenge : in all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore although I wrote to you , it was not for his sake that I did the wrong , nor for him that suffered it ; but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Before God : therefore we were comforted . But in our consolation , we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	14	And if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I have not been put to shame ; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth , so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his bowels are more abundantly towards you ; remembering the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling you have received him .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	2	That in much experience of tribulation , they have had abundance of joy ; and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I speak not as commanding ; but by the carefulness of others , approving also the good disposition of your charity .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For according to their power ( I bear them witness ) , and beyond their power , they were willing .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	4	With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And not as we hoped , but they gave their own selves first to the Lord , then to us by the will of God :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch , that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so also he would finish among you this same grace .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	7	That as in all things you abound in faith , and word , and knowledge , and all carefulness ; moreover also in your charity towards us , so in this grace also you may abound .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that being rich he became poor , for your sakes ; that through his poverty you might be rich .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice ; for this is profitable for you , who have begun not only to do , but also to be willing , a year ago .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform ye it also in deed ; that as your mind is forward to be willing , so it may be also to perform , out of that which you have .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the will be forward , it is accepted according to that which a man hath , not according to that which he hath not .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that others should be eased , and you burthened , but by an equality .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	14	In this present time let your abundance supply their want , that their abundance also may supply your want , that there may be an equality ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written : He that had much , had nothing over ; and he that had little , had no want .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	16	And thanks be to God , who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more careful , of his own will he went unto you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We have sent also with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And not that only , but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels , for this grace , which is administered by us , to the glory of the Lord , and our determined will :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this , lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	21	For we forecast what may be good not only before God , but also before men .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother also , whom we have often proved diligent in many things ; but now much more diligent , with much confidence in you ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Either for Titus , who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you , or our brethren , the apostles of the churches , the glory of Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them , in the sight of the churches , the evidence of your charity , and of our boasting on your behalf . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	2	For I know your forward mind : for which I boast of you to the Macedonians . That Achaia also is ready from the year past , and your emulation hath provoked very many .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	9	As it is written : He hath dispersed abroad , he hath given to the poor : his justice remaineth for ever .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Now I have sent the brethren , that the thing which we boast of concerning you , be not made void in this behalf , that ( as I have said ) you may be ready :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Lest , when the Macedonians shall come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( not to say ye ) should be ashamed in this matter .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before , and prepare this blessing before promised , to be ready , so as a blessing , not as covetousness .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Now this I say : He who soweth sparingly , shall also reap sparingly : and he who soweth in blessings , shall also reap blessings .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Every one as he hath determined in his heart , not with sadness , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound in you ; that ye always , having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	10	And he that ministereth seed to the sower , will both give you bread to eat , and will multiply your seed , and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice :
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	11	That being enriched in all things , you may abound unto all simplicity , which worketh through us thanksgiving to God .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	12	Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints , but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	13	By the proof of this ministry , glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ , and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them , and unto all .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And in their praying for you , being desirous of you , because of the excellent grace of God in you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present , with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold , against some , who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	10	( For his epistles indeed , say they , are weighty and strong ; but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible , )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war according to the flesh .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	4	For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty to God unto the pulling down of fortifications , destroying counsels ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	5	And every height that exhalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience shall be fulfilled .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	7	See the things that are according to outward appearance . If any man trust to himself , that he is Christ 's , let him think this again with himself , that as he is Christ 's , so are we also .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power , which the Lord hath given us unto edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	9	But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a one think this , that such as we are in word by epistles , when absent , such also we will be indeed when present .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not match , or compare ourselves with some , that commend themselves ; but we measure ourselves by ourselves , and compare ourselves with ourselves .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not glory beyond our measure ; but according to the measure of the rule , which God hath measured to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as if we reached not unto you . For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	15	Not glorying beyond measure in other men 's labours ; but having hope of your increasing faith , to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly ;
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	16	Yea , unto those places that are beyond you , to preach the gospel , not to glory in another man 's rule , in those things that are made ready to our hand .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	10	18	For not he who commendeth himself , is approved , but he , whom God commendeth . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God . For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore ? Because I love you not ? God knoweth it .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear lest , as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted , and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ , whom we have not preached ; or if you receive another Spirit , whom you have not received ; or another gospel which you have not received ; you might well bear with him .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great apostles .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	6	For although I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but in all things we have been made manifest to you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a fault , humbling myself , that you might be exalted ? Because I preached unto you the gospel of God freely ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I have taken from other churches , receiving wages of them for your ministry .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And , when I was present with you , and wanted , I was chargeable to no man : for that which was wanting to me , the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia ; and in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you , and so I will keep myself .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	10	The truth of Christ is in me , that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion , that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such false apostles are deceitful workmen , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder : for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice , whose end shall be according to their works .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I say again , ( let no man think me to be foolish , otherwise take me as one foolish , that I also may glory a little . )
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak , I speak not according to God , but as it were in foolishness , in this matter of glorying .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory according to the flesh , I will glory also .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For you gladly suffer the foolish ; whereas yourselves are wise .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take from you , if a man be lifted up , if a man strike you on the face .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak according to dishonour , as if we had been weak in this part . Wherein if any man dare ( I speak foolishly ) , I dare also .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	22	They are Hebrews : so am I . They are Israelites : so am I . They are the seed of Abraham : so am I .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	23	They are the ministers of Christ ( I speak as one less wise ) : I am more ; in many more labours , in prisons more frequently , in stripes above measure , in deaths often .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes , save one .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods , once I was stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	26	In journeying often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils from my own nation , in perils from the Gentiles , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils from false brethren .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	27	In labour and painfulness , in much watchings , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides those things which are without : my daily instance , the solicitude for all the churches .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is scandalized , and I am not on fire ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory , I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who is blessed for ever , knoweth that I lie not .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	11	32	At Damascus , the governor of the nation under Aretas the king , guarded the city of the Damascenes , to apprehend me .

DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I know not , or out of the body , I know not ; God knoweth ) , such a one caught up to the third heaven .

DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I know such a man ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I know not : God knoweth ) ,
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	4	That he was caught up into paradise , and heard secret words , which it is not granted to man to utter .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	5	For such an one I will glory ; but for myself I will glory nothing , but in my infirmities .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For though I should have a mind to glory , I shall not be foolish ; for I will say the truth . But I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me , or any thing he heareth from me .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me , there was given me a sting of my flesh , an angel of Satan , to buffet me .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	8	For which thing thrice I besought the Lord , that it might depart from me .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he said to me : My grace is sufficient for thee ; for power is made perfect in infirmity . Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may dwell in me .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	10	For which cause I please myself in my infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses , for Christ . For when I am weak , then am I powerful .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I am become foolish : you have compelled me . For I ought to have been commended by you : for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles , although I be nothing .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For what is there that you have had less than the other churches , but that I myself was not burthensome to you ? Pardon me this injury .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be burthensome unto you . For I seek not the things that are yours , but you . For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	15	But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls ; although loving you more , I be loved less .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be it so : I did not burthen you : but being crafty , I caught you by guile .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus , and I sent with him a brother . Did Titus overreach you ? Did we not walk with the same spirit ? did we not in the same steps ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Of old , think you that we excuse ourselves to you ? We speak before God in Christ ; but all things , my dearly beloved , for your edification .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall be found by you such as you would not . Lest perhaps contentions , envyings , animosities , dissensions , detractions , whisperings , swellings , seditions , be among you .

DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	3	Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me , who towards you is not weak , but is mighty in you ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For although he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . For we also are weak in him : but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Try your own selves if you be in the faith ; prove ye yourselves . Know you not your own selves , that Christ Jesus is in you , unless perhaps you be reprobates ?
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	7	Now we pray God , that you may do no evil , not that we may appear approved , but that you may do that which is good , and that we may be as reprobates .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth ; but for the truth .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	9	For we rejoice that we are weak , and you are strong . This also we pray for , your perfection .
DRA	2%20Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things , being absent , that , being present , I may not deal more severely , according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification , and not unto destruction .

DRA	Galatians	1	1	Paul , an apostle , not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ,
DRA	Galatians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren who are with me , to the churches of Galatia .
DRA	Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you , and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Galatians	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present wicked world , according to the will of God and our Father :
DRA	Galatians	1	5	To whom is glory for ever and ever . Amen .
DRA	Galatians	1	6	I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ , unto another gospel .
DRA	Galatians	1	7	Which is not another , only there are some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
DRA	Galatians	1	8	But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you , let him be anathema .
DRA	Galatians	1	9	As we said before , so now I say again : If any one preach to you a gospel , besides that which you have received , let him be anathema .
DRA	Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men , or God ? Or do I seek to please men ? If I yet pleased men , I should not be the servant of Christ .
DRA	Galatians	1	11	For I give you to understand , brethren , that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man .
DRA	Galatians	1	12	For neither did I receive it of man , nor did I learn it ; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
DRA	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion : how that , beyond measure , I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it .
DRA	Galatians	1	14	And I made progress in the Jews ' religion above many of my equals in my own nation , being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers .
DRA	Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased him , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
DRA	Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me , that I might preach him among the Gentiles , immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood .
DRA	Galatians	1	17	Neither went I to Jerusalem , to the apostles who were before me : but I went into Arabia , and again I returned to Damascus .
DRA	Galatians	1	18	Then , after three years , I went to Jerusalem , to see Peter , and I tarried with him fifteen days .
DRA	Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles I saw none , saving James the brother of the Lord .
DRA	Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I lie not .
DRA	Galatians	1	21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia .
DRA	Galatians	1	22	And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea , which were in Christ :
DRA	Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only : He , who persecuted us in times past , doth now preach the faith which once he impugned :
DRA	Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Galatians	2	2	And I went up according to revelation ; and communicated to them the gospel , which I preach among the Gentiles , but apart to them who seemed to be some thing : lest perhaps I should run , or had run in vain .
DRA	Galatians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Gentile , was compelled to be circumcised .
DRA	Galatians	2	4	But because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privately to spy our liberty , which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into servitude .
DRA	Galatians	2	5	To whom we yielded not by subjection , no not for an hour , that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
DRA	Galatians	2	6	But of them who seemed to be some thing , ( what they were some time , it is nothing to me , God accepteth not the person of man , ) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing .
DRA	Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise , when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision , as to Peter was that of the circumcision .
DRA	Galatians	2	8	( For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , wrought in me also among the Gentiles . )
DRA	Galatians	2	9	And when they had known the grace that was given to me , James and Cephas and John , who seemed to be pillars , gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship : that we should go unto the Gentiles , and they unto the circumcision :
DRA	Galatians	2	10	Only that we should be mindful of the poor : which same thing also I was careful to do .
DRA	Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
DRA	Galatians	2	12	For before that some came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them who were of the circumcision .
DRA	Galatians	2	13	And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented , so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation .
DRA	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas before them all : If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of the Gentiles , and not as the Jews do , how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
DRA	Galatians	2	15	We by nature are Jews , and not of the Gentiles sinners .
DRA	Galatians	2	16	But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ ; we also believe in Christ Jesus , that we may be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified .
DRA	Galatians	2	17	But if while we seek to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners ; is Christ then the minister of sin ? God forbid .
DRA	Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed , I make myself a prevaricator .
DRA	Galatians	2	19	For I , through the law , am dead to the law , that I may live to God : with Christ I am nailed to the cross .
DRA	Galatians	2	20	And I live , now not I ; but Christ liveth in me . And that I live now in the flesh : I live in the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and delivered himself for me .
DRA	Galatians	2	21	I cast not away the grace of God . For if justice be by the law , then Christ died in vain . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish , that , whereas you began in the Spirit , you would now be made perfect by the flesh ?
DRA	Galatians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you : Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
DRA	Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so great things in vain ? If it be yet in vain .
DRA	Galatians	3	5	He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you ; doth he do it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of the faith ?
DRA	Galatians	3	6	As it is written : Abraham believed God , and it was reputed to him unto justice .
DRA	Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore , that they who are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
DRA	Galatians	3	8	And the scripture , foreseeing , that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith , told unto Abraham before : In thee shall all nations be blessed .
DRA	Galatians	3	9	Therefore they that are of faith , shall be blessed with faithful Abraham .
DRA	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law , are under a curse . For it is written : Cursed is every one , that abideth not in all things , which are written in the book of the law to do them .
DRA	Galatians	3	11	But that in the law no man is justified with God , it is manifest : because the just man liveth by faith .
DRA	Galatians	3	12	But the law is not of faith : but , He that doth those things , shall live in them .
DRA	Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written : Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
DRA	Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus : that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith .
DRA	Galatians	3	15	Brethren ( I speak after the manner of man , ) yet a man 's testament , if it be confirmed , no man despiseth , nor addeth to it .
DRA	Galatians	3	16	To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed . He saith not , And to his seeds , as of many : but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .
DRA	Galatians	3	17	Now this I say , that the testament which was confirmed by God , the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years , doth not disannul , to make the promise of no effect .
DRA	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise . But God gave it to Abraham by promise .
DRA	Galatians	3	19	Why then was the law ? It was set because of transgressions , until the seed should come , to whom he made the promise , being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
DRA	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not of one : but God is one .
DRA	Galatians	3	21	Was the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid . For if there had been a law given which could give life , verily justice should have been by the law .
DRA	Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise , by the faith of Jesus Christ , might be given to them that believe .
DRA	Galatians	3	23	But before the faith came , we were kept under the law shut up , unto that faith which was to be revealed .
DRA	Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
DRA	Galatians	3	25	But after the faith is come , we are no longer under a pedagogue .
DRA	Galatians	3	26	For you are all the children of God by faith , in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ , have put on Christ .
DRA	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek : there is neither bond nor free : there is neither male nor female . For you are all one in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Galatians	3	29	And if you be Christ 's , then are you the seed of Abraham , heirs according to the promise . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come , God sent his Son , made of a woman , made under the law :
DRA	Galatians	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father :
DRA	Galatians	4	3	So we also , when we were children , were serving under the elements of the world .
DRA	Galatians	4	5	That he might redeem them who were under the law : that we might receive the adoption of sons .
DRA	Galatians	4	6	And because you are sons , God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying : Abba , Father .
DRA	Galatians	4	7	Therefore now he is not a servant , but a son . And if a son , an heir also through God .
DRA	Galatians	4	8	But then indeed , not knowing God , you served them , who , by nature , are not gods .
DRA	Galatians	4	9	But now , after that you have known God , or rather are known by God : how turn you again to the weak and needy elements , which you desire to serve again ?
DRA	Galatians	4	10	You observe days , and months , and times , and years .
DRA	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you , lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you .
DRA	Galatians	4	12	Be ye as I , because I also am as you : brethren , I beseech you : you have not injured me at all .
DRA	Galatians	4	13	And you know , how through infirmity of the flesh , I preached the gospel to you heretofore : and your temptation in my flesh ,
DRA	Galatians	4	14	You despised not , nor rejected : but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
DRA	Galatians	4	15	Where is then your blessedness ? For I bear you witness , that , if it could be done , you would have plucked out your own eyes , and would have given them to me .
DRA	Galatians	4	16	Am I then become your enemy , because I tell you the truth ?
DRA	Galatians	4	17	They are zealous in your regard not well : but they would exclude you , that you might be zealous for them .
DRA	Galatians	4	18	But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always : and not only when I am present with you .
DRA	Galatians	4	19	My little children , of whom I am in labour again , until Christ be formed in you .
DRA	Galatians	4	20	And I would willingly be present with you now , and change my voice : because I am ashamed for you .
DRA	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you that desire to be under the law , have you not read the law ?
DRA	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons : the one by a bondwoman , and the other by a free woman .
DRA	Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman , was born according to the flesh : but he of the free woman , was by promise .
DRA	Galatians	4	24	Which things are said by an allegory . For these are the two testaments . The one from mount Sina , engendering unto bondage ; which is Agar :
DRA	Galatians	4	25	For Sina is a mountain in Arabia , which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
DRA	Galatians	4	26	But that Jerusalem , which is above , is free : which is our mother .
DRA	Galatians	4	27	For it is written : Rejoice , thou barren , that bearest not : break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for many are the children of the desolate , more than of her that hath a husband .
DRA	Galatians	4	28	Now we , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise .
DRA	Galatians	4	29	But as then he , that was born according to the flesh , persecuted him that was after the spirit ; so also it is now .
DRA	Galatians	4	30	But what saith the scripture ? Cast out the bondwoman and her son ; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman .
DRA	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not the children of the bondwoman , but of the free : by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Galatians	5	5	For we in spirit , by faith , wait for the hope of justice .
DRA	Galatians	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Galatians	5	2	Behold , I Paul tell you , that if you be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
DRA	Galatians	5	3	And I testify again to every man circumcising himself , that he is a debtor to the whole law .
DRA	Galatians	5	4	You are made void of Christ , you who are justified in the law : you are fallen from grace .
DRA	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision : but faith that worketh by charity .
DRA	Galatians	5	7	You did run well , who hath hindered you , that you should not obey the truth ?
DRA	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from him that calleth you .
DRA	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump .
DRA	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord : that you will not be of another mind : but he that troubleth you , shall bear the judgment , whosoever he be .
DRA	Galatians	5	11	And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? Then is the scandal of the cross made void .
DRA	Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off , who trouble you .
DRA	Galatians	5	13	For you , brethren , have been called unto liberty : only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh , but by charity of the spirit serve one another .
DRA	Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word : Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
DRA	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another ; take heed you be not consumed one of another .
DRA	Galatians	5	16	I say then , walk in the spirit , and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh .
DRA	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the spirit : and the spirit against the flesh ; for these are contrary one to another : so that you do not the things that you would .
DRA	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the spirit , you are not under the law .
DRA	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are fornication , uncleanness , immodesty , luxury ,
DRA	Galatians	5	20	Idolatry , witchcrafts , enmities , contentions , emulations , wraths , quarrels , dissensions , sects ,
DRA	Galatians	5	21	Envies , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like . Of the which I foretell you , as I have foretold to you , that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God .
DRA	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is , charity , joy , peace , patience , benignity , goodness , longanimity ,
DRA	Galatians	5	23	Mildness , faith , modesty , continency , chastity . Against such there is no law .
DRA	Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christ 's , have crucified their flesh , with the vices and concupiscences .
DRA	Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .

DRA	Galatians	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another 's burdens ; and so you shall fulfill the law of Christ .
DRA	Galatians	6	3	For if any man think himself to be some thing , whereas he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
DRA	Galatians	6	4	But let every one prove his own work , and so he shall have glory in himself only , and not in another .
DRA	Galatians	6	5	For every one shall bear his own burden .
DRA	Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived , God is not mocked .
DRA	Galatians	6	8	For what things a man shall sow , those also shall he reap . For he that soweth in his flesh , of the flesh also shall reap corruption . But he that soweth in the spirit , of the spirit shall reap life everlasting .
DRA	Galatians	6	9	And in doing good , let us not fail . For in due time we shall reap , not failing .
DRA	Galatians	6	10	Therefore , whilst we have time , let us work good to all men , but especially to those who are of the household of the faith .
DRA	Galatians	6	11	See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand .
DRA	Galatians	6	12	For as many as desire to please in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised , only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ .
DRA	Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised , keep the law ; but they will have you to be circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
DRA	Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ ; by whom the world is crucified to me , and I to the world .
DRA	Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
DRA	Galatians	6	16	And whosoever shall follow this rule , peace on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .

DRA	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places , in Christ :
DRA	Ephesians	1	4	As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity .
DRA	Ephesians	1	5	Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ unto himself : according to the purpose of his will :
DRA	Ephesians	1	6	Unto the praise of the glory of his grace , in which he hath graced us in his beloved son .
DRA	Ephesians	1	7	In whom we have redemption through his blood , the remission of sins , according to the riches of his grace ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	8	Which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and prudence ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	9	That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure , which he hath purposed in him ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	10	In the dispensation of the fulness of times , to re-establish all things in Christ , that are in heaven and on earth , in him .
DRA	Ephesians	1	11	In whom we also are called by lot , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will .
DRA	Ephesians	1	12	That we may be unto the praise of his glory , we who before hoped Christ :
DRA	Ephesians	1	13	In whom you also , after you had heard the word of truth , ( the gospel of your salvation ; ) in whom also believing , you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	14	Who is the pledge of our inheritance , unto the redemption of acquisition , unto the praise of his glory .
DRA	Ephesians	1	15	Wherefore I also , hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus , and of your love towards all the saints ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	16	Cease not to give thanks for you , making commemoration of you in my prayers ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation , in the knowledge of him :
DRA	Ephesians	1	18	The eyes of your heart enlightened , that you may know what the hope is of the glory of his inheritance in the saints .
DRA	Ephesians	1	19	And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us , who believe according to the operation of the might of his power ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	20	Which he wrought in Christ , raising him up from the dead , and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places .
DRA	Ephesians	1	21	Above all principality , and power , and virtue , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come .
DRA	Ephesians	1	22	And he hath subjected all things under his feet , and hath made him head over all the church ,
DRA	Ephesians	1	23	Which is his body , and the fulness of him who is filled all in all . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ephesians	2	2	Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of this air , of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief :
DRA	Ephesians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ephesians	2	3	In which also we all conversed in time past , in the desires of our flesh , fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts , and were by nature children of wrath , even as the rest :
DRA	Ephesians	2	4	But God , ( who is rich in mercy , ) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us ,
DRA	Ephesians	2	5	Even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together in Christ , ( by whose grace you are saved , )
DRA	Ephesians	2	6	And hath raised us up together , and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places , through Christ Jesus .
DRA	Ephesians	2	7	That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his grace , in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Ephesians	2	8	For by grace you are saved through faith , and that not of yourselves , for it is the gift of God ;
DRA	Ephesians	2	9	Not of works , that no man may glory .
DRA	Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus in good works , which God hath prepared that we should walk in them .
DRA	Ephesians	2	11	For which cause be mindful that you , being heretofore Gentiles in the flesh , who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh , made by hands ;
DRA	Ephesians	2	12	That you were at that time without Christ , being aliens from the conversation of Israel , and strangers to the testament , having no hope of the promise , and without God in this world .
DRA	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus , you , who some time were afar off , are made nigh by the blood of Christ .
DRA	Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace , who hath made both one , and breaking down the middle wall of partition , the enmities in his flesh :
DRA	Ephesians	2	15	Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees ; that he might make the two in himself into one new man , making peace ;
DRA	Ephesians	2	16	And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross , killing the enmities in himself .
DRA	Ephesians	2	17	And coming , he preached peace to you that were afar off , and peace to them that were nigh .
DRA	Ephesians	2	18	For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father .
DRA	Ephesians	2	19	Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners ; but you are fellow citizens with the saints , and the domestics of God ,
DRA	Ephesians	2	20	Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone :
DRA	Ephesians	2	21	In whom all the building , being framed together , groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord .
DRA	Ephesians	2	22	In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ephesians	3	3	How that , according to revelation , the mystery has been made known to me , as I have written above in a few words ;
DRA	Ephesians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ephesians	3	2	If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you :
DRA	Ephesians	3	4	As you reading , may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	5	Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men , as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit :
DRA	Ephesians	3	6	That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs , and of the same body , and co-partners of his promise in Christ Jesus , by the gospel :
DRA	Ephesians	3	7	Of which I am made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God , which is given to me according to the operation of his power :
DRA	Ephesians	3	8	To me , the least of all the saints , is given this grace , to preach among the Gentiles , the unsearchable riches of Christ ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	9	And to enlighten all men , that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God , who created all things :
DRA	Ephesians	3	10	That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	11	According to the eternal purpose , which he made , in Christ Jesus our Lord :
DRA	Ephesians	3	12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him .
DRA	Ephesians	3	13	Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
DRA	Ephesians	3	14	For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	15	Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	16	That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	17	That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts ; that being rooted and founded in charity ,
DRA	Ephesians	3	18	You may be able to comprehend , with all the saints , what is the breadth , and length , and height , and depth :
DRA	Ephesians	3	19	To know also the charity of Christ , which surpasseth all knowledge , that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God .
DRA	Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand , according to the power that worketh in us ;
DRA	Ephesians	3	21	To him be glory in the church , and in Christ Jesus unto all generations , world without end . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ephesians	4	4	One body and one Spirit ; as you are called in one hope of your calling .
DRA	Ephesians	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ephesians	4	2	With all humility and mildness , with patience , supporting one another in charity .
DRA	Ephesians	4	3	Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
DRA	Ephesians	4	5	One Lord , one faith , one baptism .
DRA	Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in us all .
DRA	Ephesians	4	7	But to every one of us is given grace , according to the measure of the giving of Christ .
DRA	Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he saith : Ascending on high , he led captivity captive ; he gave gifts to men .
DRA	Ephesians	4	9	Now that he ascended , what is it , but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
DRA	Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
DRA	Ephesians	4	11	And he gave some apostles , and some prophets , and other some evangelists , and other some pastors and doctors ,
DRA	Ephesians	4	12	For the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
DRA	Ephesians	4	13	Until we all meet into the unity of faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ ;
DRA	Ephesians	4	14	That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men , by cunning craftiness , by which they lie in wait to deceive .
DRA	Ephesians	4	15	But doing the truth in charity , we may in all things grow up in him who is the head , even Christ :
DRA	Ephesians	4	16	From whom the whole body , being compacted and fitly joined together , by what every joint supplieth , according to the operation in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body , unto the edifying of itself in charity .
DRA	Ephesians	4	17	This then I say and testify in the Lord : That henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind ,
DRA	Ephesians	4	18	Having their understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their hearts .
DRA	Ephesians	4	19	Who despairing , have given themselves up to lasciviousness , unto the working of all uncleanness , unto the working of all uncleanness , unto covetousness .
DRA	Ephesians	4	20	But you have not so learned Christ ;
DRA	Ephesians	4	21	If so be that you have heard him , and have been taught in him , as the truth is in Jesus :
DRA	Ephesians	4	22	To put off , according to former conversation , the old man , who is corrupted according to the desire of error .
DRA	Ephesians	4	23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind :
DRA	Ephesians	4	24	And put on the new man , who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth .
DRA	Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore putting away lying , speak ye the truth every man with his neighbour ; for we are members one of another .
DRA	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry , and sin not . Let not the sun go down upon your anger .
DRA	Ephesians	4	27	Give not place to the devil .
DRA	Ephesians	4	28	He that stole , let him now steal no more ; but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need .
DRA	Ephesians	4	29	Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth ; but that which is good , to the edification of faith , that it may administer grace to the hearers .
DRA	Ephesians	4	30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God : whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption .
DRA	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness , and anger , and indignation , and clamour , and blasphemy , be put away from you , with all malice .
DRA	Ephesians	4	32	And be ye kind one to another ; merciful , forgiving one another , even as God hath forgiven you in Christ . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ephesians	5	5	For know you this and understand , that no fornicator , or unclean , or covetous person ( which is a serving of idols ) , hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
DRA	Ephesians	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath delivered himself for us , an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness .
DRA	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not so much as be named among you , as becometh saints :
DRA	Ephesians	5	4	Or obscenity , or foolish talking , or scurrility , which is to no purpose ; but rather giving of thanks .
DRA	Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words . For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief .
DRA	Ephesians	5	7	Be ye not therefore partakers with them .
DRA	Ephesians	5	8	For you were heretofore darkness , but now light in the Lord . Walk then as children of the light .
DRA	Ephesians	5	9	For the fruit of the light is in all goodness , and justice , and truth ;
DRA	Ephesians	5	10	Proving what is well pleasing to God :
DRA	Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
DRA	Ephesians	5	12	For the things that are done by them in secret , it is a shame even to speak of .
DRA	Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved , are made manifest by the light ; for all that is made manifest is light .
DRA	Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith : Rise thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead : and Christ shall enlighten thee .
DRA	Ephesians	5	15	See therefore , brethren , how you walk circumspectly : not as unwise ,
DRA	Ephesians	5	16	But as wise : redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
DRA	Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore become not unwise , but understanding what is the will of God .
DRA	Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine , wherein is luxury ; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit ,
DRA	Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms , and hymns , and spiritual canticles , singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord ;
DRA	Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , to God and the Father :
DRA	Ephesians	5	21	Being subject one to another , in the fear of Christ .
DRA	Ephesians	5	22	Let women be subject to their husbands , as to the Lord :
DRA	Ephesians	5	23	Because the husband is the head of the wife , as Christ is the head of the church . He is the saviour of his body .
DRA	Ephesians	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject to Christ , so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things .
DRA	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , as Christ also loved the church , and delivered himself up for it :
DRA	Ephesians	5	26	That he might sanctify it , cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life :
DRA	Ephesians	5	27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy , and without blemish .
DRA	Ephesians	5	28	So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife , loveth himself .
DRA	Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , as also Christ doth the church :
DRA	Ephesians	5	30	Because we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
DRA	Ephesians	5	31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife , and they shall be two in one flesh .
DRA	Ephesians	5	32	This is a great sacrament ; but I speak in Christ and in the church .
DRA	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself : and let the wife fear her husband . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Ephesians	6	6	Not serving to the eye , as it were pleasing men , but , as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart ,
DRA	Ephesians	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	Ephesians	6	2	Honour thy father and thy mother , which is the first commandment with a promise :
DRA	Ephesians	6	3	That it may be well with thee , and thou mayest be long lived upon earth .
DRA	Ephesians	6	4	And you , fathers , provoke not your children to anger ; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord .
DRA	Ephesians	6	5	Servants , be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in the simplicity of your heart , as to Christ :
DRA	Ephesians	6	7	With a good will serving , as to the Lord , and not to men .
DRA	Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do , the same shall he receive from the Lord , whether he be bond , or free .
DRA	Ephesians	6	9	And you , masters , do the same things to them , forbearing threatenings , knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven ; and there is no respect of persons with him .
DRA	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , brethren , be strengthened in the Lord , and in the might of his power .
DRA	Ephesians	6	11	Put you on the armour of God , that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil .
DRA	Ephesians	6	12	For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood ; but against principalities and power , against the rulers of the world of this darkness , against the spirits of wickedness in the high places .
DRA	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore take unto you the armour of God , that you may be able to resist in the evil day , and to stand in all things perfect .
DRA	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of justice ,
DRA	Ephesians	6	15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace :
DRA	Ephesians	6	16	In all things taking the shield of faith , wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one .
DRA	Ephesians	6	17	And take unto you the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit ( which is the word of God ) .
DRA	Ephesians	6	18	By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit ; and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints :
DRA	Ephesians	6	19	And for me , that speech may be given me , that I may open my mouth with confidence , to make known the mystery of the gospel .
DRA	Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in a chain , so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought .
DRA	Ephesians	6	21	But that you also may know the things that concern me , and what I am doing , Tychicus , my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord , will make known to you all things :
DRA	Ephesians	6	22	Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose , that you may know the things concerning us , and that he may comfort your hearts .
DRA	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith , from God the Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timothy , the servants of Jesus Christ ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus , who are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons .
DRA	Philippians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Philippians	1	2	Grace be unto you , and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	Philippians	1	3	I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you ,
DRA	Philippians	1	4	Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all , with joy ;
DRA	Philippians	1	5	For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now .
DRA	Philippians	1	6	Being confident of this very thing , that he , who hath begun a good work in you , will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philippians	1	7	As it is meet for me to think this for you all , for that I have you in my heart ; and that in my bands , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , you all are partakers of my joy .
DRA	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness , how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
DRA	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge , and in all understanding :
DRA	Philippians	1	10	That you may approve the better things , that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ ,
DRA	Philippians	1	11	Filled with the fruit of justice , through Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
DRA	Philippians	1	12	Now , brethren , I desire you should know , that the things which have happened to me , have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel :
DRA	Philippians	1	13	So that my bands are made manifest in Christ , in all the court , and in all other places ;
DRA	Philippians	1	14	And many of the brethren in the Lord , growing confident by my bands , are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear .
DRA	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed , even out of envy and contention ; but some also for good will preach Christ .
DRA	Philippians	1	16	Some out of charity , knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel .
DRA	Philippians	1	17	And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely : supposing that they raise affliction to my bands .
DRA	Philippians	1	18	But what then ? So that by all means , whether by occasion , or by truth , Christ be preached : in this also I rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
DRA	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation , through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Philippians	1	20	According to my expectation and hope ; that in nothing I shall be confounded , but with all confidence , as always , so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body , wither it be by life , or by death .
DRA	Philippians	1	21	For to me , to live is Christ ; and to die is gain .
DRA	Philippians	1	22	And if to live in the flesh , this is to me the fruit of labour , and what I shall choose I know not .
DRA	Philippians	1	23	But I am straitened between two : having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ , a thing by far the better .
DRA	Philippians	1	24	But to abide still in the flesh , is needful for you .
DRA	Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide , and continue with you all , for your furtherance and joy of faith :
DRA	Philippians	1	26	That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me , by my coming to you again .
DRA	Philippians	1	27	Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ : that , whether I come and see you , or , being absent , may hear of you , that you stand fast in one spirit , with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel .
DRA	Philippians	1	28	And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries : which to them is a cause of perdition , but to you of salvation , and this from God :
DRA	Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given for Christ , not only to believe in him , but also to suffer for him .
DRA	Philippians	1	30	Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me , and now have heard of me . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Philippians	2	2	Fulfill ye my joy , that you may be of one mind , having the same charity , being of one accord , agreeing in sentiment .
DRA	Philippians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through contention , neither by vain glory : but in humility , let each esteem others better than themselves :
DRA	Philippians	2	4	Each one not considering the things that are his own , but those that are other men 's .
DRA	Philippians	2	5	For let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
DRA	Philippians	2	6	Who being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
DRA	Philippians	2	7	But emptied himself , taking the form of a servant , being made in the likeness of men , and in habit found as a man .
DRA	Philippians	2	8	He humbled himself , becoming obedient unto death , even to the death of the cross .
DRA	Philippians	2	9	For which cause God also hath exalted him , and hath given him a name which is above all names :
DRA	Philippians	2	10	That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of those that are in heaven , on earth , and under the earth :
DRA	Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father .
DRA	Philippians	2	12	Wherefore , my dearly beloved , ( as you have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but much more now in my absence , ) with fear and trembling work out your salvation .
DRA	Philippians	2	13	For it is God who worketh in you , both to will and to accomplish , according to his good will .
DRA	Philippians	2	14	And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations ;
DRA	Philippians	2	15	That you may be blameless , and sincere children of God , without reproof , in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation ; among whom you shine as lights in the world .
DRA	Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ , because I have not run in vain , nor laboured in vain .
DRA	Philippians	2	17	Yea , and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and congratulate with you all .
DRA	Philippians	2	18	And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice , and congratulate with me .
DRA	Philippians	2	19	And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know the things concerning you .
DRA	Philippians	2	20	For I have no man so of the same mind , who with sincere affection is solicitous for you .
DRA	Philippians	2	21	For all seek the things that are their own ; not the things that are Jesus Christ 's .
DRA	Philippians	2	22	Now know ye the proof of him , that as a son with the father , so hath he served with me in the gospel .
DRA	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
DRA	Philippians	2	24	And I trust in the Lord , that I myself also shall come to you shortly .
DRA	Philippians	2	25	But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow labourer , and fellow soldier , but your apostle , and he that hath ministered to my wants .
DRA	Philippians	2	26	For indeed he longed after you all : and was sad , for that you had heard that he was sick .
DRA	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick , nigh unto death ; but God had mercy on him ; and not only on him , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
DRA	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I sent him the more speedily : that seeing him again , you may rejoice , and I may be without sorrow .
DRA	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord ; and treat with honour such as he is .
DRA	Philippians	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death : delivering his life , that he might fulfill that which on your part was wanting towards my service . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision , who in spirit serve God ; and glory in Christ Jesus , not having confidence in the flesh .
DRA	Philippians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the concision .
DRA	Philippians	3	4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh . If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh , I more ,
DRA	Philippians	3	5	Being circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , an Hebrew of the Hebrews ; according to the law , a Pharisee :
DRA	Philippians	3	6	According to zeal , persecuting the church of God ; according to the justice that is in the law , conversing without blame .
DRA	Philippians	3	7	But the things that were gain to me , the same I have counted loss for Christ .
DRA	Philippians	3	8	Furthermore I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord ; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and count them but as dung , that I may gain Christ :
DRA	Philippians	3	9	And may be found in him , not having my justice , which is of the law , but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus , which is of God , justice in faith :
DRA	Philippians	3	10	That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable to his death ,
DRA	Philippians	3	11	If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead .
DRA	Philippians	3	12	Not as though I has already attained , or were already perfect ; but I follow after , if I may by any means apprehend , wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , I do not count myself to have apprehended . But one thing I do : forgetting the things that are behind , and stretching forth myself to those that are before ,
DRA	Philippians	3	14	I press towards the mark , to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore , as many as are perfect , be thus minded ; and if in any thing you be otherwise minded , this also God will reveal to you .
DRA	Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless whereunto we are come , that we be of the same mind , let us also continue in the same rule .
DRA	Philippians	3	17	Be ye followers of me , brethren , and observe them who walk so as you have our model .
DRA	Philippians	3	18	For many walk , of whom I have told you often ( and now tell you weeping ) , that they are enemies of the cross of Christ ;
DRA	Philippians	3	19	Whose end is destruction ; whose God is their belly ; and whose glory is in their shame ; who mind earthly things .
DRA	Philippians	3	20	But our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Philippians	3	21	Who will reform the body of our lowness , made like to the body of his glory , according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always ; again , I say , rejoice .
DRA	Philippians	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Philippians	4	2	I beg of Evodia , and I beseech Syntyche , to be of one mind in the Lord .
DRA	Philippians	4	3	And I entreat thee also , my sincere companion , help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers , whose names are in the book of life .
DRA	Philippians	4	5	Let your modesty be known to all men . The Lord is nigh .
DRA	Philippians	4	6	Be nothing solicitous ; but in every thing , by prayer and supplication , with thanksgiving , let your petitions be made known to God .
DRA	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God , which surpasseth all understanding , keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philippians	4	8	For the rest , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever modest , whatsoever just , whatsoever holy , whatsoever lovely , whatsoever of good fame , if there be any virtue , if any praise of discipline , think on these things .
DRA	Philippians	4	9	The things which you have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , these do ye , and the God of peace shall be with you .
DRA	Philippians	4	10	Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly , that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again , as you did also think ; but you were busied .
DRA	Philippians	4	11	I speak not as it were for want . For I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , to be content therewith .
DRA	Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be brought low , and I know how to abound : ( everywhere , and in all things I am instructed ) both to be full , and to be hungry ; both to abound , and to suffer need .
DRA	Philippians	4	13	I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me .
DRA	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation .
DRA	Philippians	4	15	And you also know , O Philippians , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but you only :
DRA	Philippians	4	16	For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use .
DRA	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek the gift , but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account .
DRA	Philippians	4	18	But I have all , and abound : I am filled , having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent , an odour of sweetness , an acceptable sacrifice , pleasing to God .
DRA	Philippians	4	19	And may my God supply all your want , according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philippians	4	20	Now to God and our Father be glory world without end . Amen .
DRA	Philippians	4	21	Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philippians	4	22	The brethren who are with me , salute you . All the saints salute you ; especially they that are of Caesar 's household .

DRA	Colossians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ , by the will of God , and Timothy , a brother ,
DRA	Colossians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Colossians	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ Jesus , who are at Colossa .
DRA	Colossians	1	3	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ . We give thanks to God , and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you .
DRA	Colossians	1	4	Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus , and the love which you have towards all the saints .
DRA	Colossians	1	5	For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven , which you have heard in the word of the truth of the gospel ,
DRA	Colossians	1	6	Which is come unto you , as also it is in the whole world , and bringeth forth fruit and groweth , even as it doth in you , since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth .
DRA	Colossians	1	7	As you learned of Epaphras , our most beloved fellow servant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus ;
DRA	Colossians	1	8	Who also hath manifested to us your love in the spirit .
DRA	Colossians	1	9	Therefore we also , from the day that we heard it , cease not to pray for you , and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will , in all wisdom , and spiritual understanding :
DRA	Colossians	1	10	That you may walk worthy of God , in all things pleasing ; being fruitful in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God :
DRA	Colossians	1	11	Strengthened with all might , according to the power of his glory , in all patience and longsuffering with joy ,
DRA	Colossians	1	12	Giving thanks to God the Father , who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light :
DRA	Colossians	1	13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love ,
DRA	Colossians	1	14	In whom we have redemption through his blood , the remission of sins ;
DRA	Colossians	1	15	Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature :
DRA	Colossians	1	16	For in him were all things created in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones , or dominations , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him and in him .
DRA	Colossians	1	17	And he is before all , and by him all things consist .
DRA	Colossians	1	18	And he is the head of the body , the church , who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he may hold the primacy :
DRA	Colossians	1	19	Because in him , it hath well pleased the Father , that all fullness should dwell ;
DRA	Colossians	1	20	And through him to reconcile all things unto himself , making peace through the blood of his cross , both as to the things that are on earth , and the things that are in heaven .
DRA	Colossians	1	21	And you , whereas you were some time alienated and enemies in mind in evil works :
DRA	Colossians	1	22	Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and unspotted , and blameless before him :
DRA	Colossians	1	23	If so ye continue in the faith , grounded and settled , and immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard , which is preached in all the creation that is under heaven , whereof I Paul am made a minister .
DRA	Colossians	1	24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ , in my flesh , for his body , which is the church :
DRA	Colossians	1	25	Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God , which is given me towards you , that I may fulfill the word of God :
DRA	Colossians	1	26	The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations , but now is manifested to his saints ,
DRA	Colossians	1	27	To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ , in you the hope of glory .
DRA	Colossians	1	28	Whom we preach , admonishing every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Colossians	1	29	Wherein also I labour , striving according to his working which he worketh in me in power . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Colossians	2	2	That their hearts may be comforted , being instructed in charity , and unto all riches of fulness of understanding , unto the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus :
DRA	Colossians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Colossians	2	3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
DRA	Colossians	2	4	Now this I say , that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words .
DRA	Colossians	2	5	For though I be absent in body , yet in spirit I am with you ; rejoicing , and beholding your order , and the steadfastness of your faith which is in Christ .
DRA	Colossians	2	6	As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord , walk ye in him ;
DRA	Colossians	2	7	Rooted and built up in him , and confirmed in the faith , as also you have learned , abounding in him in thanksgiving .
DRA	Colossians	2	8	Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy , and vain deceit ; according to the tradition of men , according to the elements of the world , and not according to Christ :
DRA	Colossians	2	9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally ;
DRA	Colossians	2	10	And you are filled in him , who is the head of all principality and power :
DRA	Colossians	2	11	In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand , in despoiling of the body of the flesh , but in the circumcision of Christ :
DRA	Colossians	2	12	Buried with him in baptism , in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him up from the dead .
DRA	Colossians	2	13	And you , when you were dead in your sins , and the uncircumcision of your flesh ; he hath quickened together with him , forgiving you all offences :
DRA	Colossians	2	14	Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us , which was contrary to us . And he hath taken the same out of the way , fastening it to the cross :
DRA	Colossians	2	15	And despoiling the principalities and powers , he hath exposed them confidently in open shew , triumphing over them in himself .
DRA	Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink , or in respect of a festival day , or of the new moon , or of the sabbaths ,
DRA	Colossians	2	17	Which are a shadow of things to come , but the body is of Christ .
DRA	Colossians	2	18	Let no man seduce you , willing in humility , and religion of angels , walking in the things which he hath not seen , in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh ,
DRA	Colossians	2	19	And not holding the head , from which the whole body , by joints and bands , being supplied with nourishment and compacted , groweth unto the increase of God .
DRA	Colossians	2	20	If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world , why do you yet decree as though living in the world ?
DRA	Colossians	2	21	Touch not , taste not , handle not :
DRA	Colossians	2	22	Which all are unto destruction by the very use , according to the precepts and doctrines of men .
DRA	Colossians	2	23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility , and not sparing the body ; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Colossians	3	3	For you are dead ; and your life is hid with Christ in God .
DRA	Colossians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Colossians	3	2	Mind the things that are above , not the things that are upon the earth .
DRA	Colossians	3	4	When Christ shall appear , who is your life , then you also shall appear with him in glory .
DRA	Colossians	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , lust , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is the service of idols .
DRA	Colossians	3	6	For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief ,
DRA	Colossians	3	7	In which you also walked some time , when you lived in them .
DRA	Colossians	3	8	But now put you also all away : anger , indignation , malice , blasphemy , filthy speech out of your mouth .
DRA	Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another : stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds ,
DRA	Colossians	3	10	And putting on the new , him who is renewed unto knowledge , according to the image of him that created him .
DRA	Colossians	3	11	Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian nor Scythian , bond nor free . But Christ is all , and in all .
DRA	Colossians	3	12	Put ye on therefore , as the elect of God , holy , and beloved , the bowels of mercy , benignity , humility , modesty , patience :
DRA	Colossians	3	13	Bearing with one another , and forgiving one another , if any have a complaint against another : even as the Lord hath forgiven you , so do you also .
DRA	Colossians	3	14	But above all these things have charity , which is the bond of perfection :
DRA	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts , wherein also you are called in one body : and be ye thankful .
DRA	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly , in all wisdom : teaching and admonishing one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual canticles , singing in grace in your hearts to God .
DRA	Colossians	3	17	All whatsoever you do in word or in work , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
DRA	Colossians	3	18	Wives , be subject to your husbands , as it behoveth in the Lord .
DRA	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter towards them .
DRA	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing to the Lord .
DRA	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , provoke not your children to indignation , lest they be discouraged .
DRA	Colossians	3	22	Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh , not serving to the eye , as pleasing men , but in simplicity of heart , fearing God .
DRA	Colossians	3	23	Whatsoever you do , do it from the heart , as to the Lord , and not to men :
DRA	Colossians	3	24	Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance . Serve ye the Lord Christ .
DRA	Colossians	3	25	For he that doth wrong , shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully : and there is no respect of persons with God . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Colossians	4	4	That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak .
DRA	Colossians	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Colossians	4	2	Be instant in prayer ; watching in it with thanksgiving :
DRA	Colossians	4	3	Praying withal for us also , that God may open unto us a door of speech to speak the mystery of Christ ( for which also I am bound ; )
DRA	Colossians	4	5	Walk with wisdom towards them that are without , redeeming the time .
DRA	Colossians	4	6	Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt : that you may know how you ought to answer every man .
DRA	Colossians	4	7	All the things that concern me , Tychicus , our dearest brother , and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord , will make known to you ,
DRA	Colossians	4	8	Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose , that he may know the things that concern you , and comfort your hearts ,
DRA	Colossians	4	9	With Onesimus , a most beloved and faithful brother , who is one of you . All things that are done here , they shall make known to you .
DRA	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , saluteth you , and Mark , the cousin german of Barnabus , touching whom you have received commandments ; if he come unto you , receive him :
DRA	Colossians	4	11	And Jesus , that is called Justus : who are of the circumcision : these only are my helpers in the kingdom of God ; who have been a comfort to me .
DRA	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras saluteth you , who is one of you , a servant of Christ Jesus , who is always solicitous for you in prayers , that you may stand perfect , and full in all the will of God .
DRA	Colossians	4	13	For I bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you , and for them that are at Laodicea , and them at Hierapolis .
DRA	Colossians	4	14	Luke , the most dear physician , saluteth you : and Demas .
DRA	Colossians	4	15	Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church that is in his house .
DRA	Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle shall have been read with you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans : and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans .
DRA	Colossians	4	17	And say to Archippus : Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfill it .

DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace . We give thanks to God always for you all ; making a remembrance of you in our prayers without ceasing ,
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	Being mindful of the work of your faith , and labour , and charity , and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing , brethren beloved of God , your election :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only , but in power also , and in the Holy Ghost , and in much fulness , as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And you became followers of us , and of the Lord ; receiving the word in much tribulation , with joy of the Holy Ghost :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord , not only in Macedonia , and in Achaia , but also in every place , your faith which is towards God , is gone forth , so that we need not to speak any thing .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves relate of us , what manner of entering in we had unto you ; and how you turned to God from idols , to serve the living and true God .

DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But having suffered many things before , and been shamefully treated ( as you know ) at Philippi , we had confidence in our God , to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of error , nor of uncleanness , nor in deceit :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us : even so we speak , not as pleasing men , but God , who proveth our hearts .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For neither have we used , at any time , the speech of flattery , as you know ; nor taken an occasion of covetousness , God is witness :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	Nor sought we glory of men , neither of you , nor of others .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	Whereas we might have been burdensome to you , as the apostles of Christ : but we became little ones in the midst of you , as if a nurse should cherish her children :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	So desirous of you , we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God , but also our own souls : because you were become most dear unto us .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For you remember , brethren , our labour and toil : working night and day , lest we should be chargeable to any of you , we preached among you the gospel of God .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	You are witnesses , and God also , how holily , and justly , and without blame , we have been to you that have believed :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	As you know in what manner , entreating and comforting you , ( as a father doth his children , )
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	We testified to every one of you , that you would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	Therefore , we also give thanks to God without ceasing : because , that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God , you received it not as the word of men , but ( as it is indeed ) the word of God , who worketh in you that have believed .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you , brethren , are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea , in Christ Jesus : for you also have suffered the same things from your own coutrymen , even as they have from the Jews ,
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and the prophets , and have persecuted us , and please not God , and are adversaries to all men ;
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles , that they may be saved , to fill up their sins always : for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brethren , being taken away from you for a short time , in sight , not in heart , have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	For we would have come unto you , I Paul indeed , once and again : but Satan hath hindered us .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of glory ? Are not you , in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?

DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved in these tribulations : for yourselves know , that we are appointed thereunto .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	And we sent Timothy , our brother , and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ , to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	For even when we were with you , we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations , as also it is come to pass , and you know .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause also , I , forbearing no longer , sent to know your faith : lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you , and our labour should be made vain .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timothy came to us from you , and related to us your faith and charity , and that you have a good remembrance of us always , desiring to see us as we also to see you ;
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore we were comforted , brethren , in you , in all our necessity and tribulation , by your faith ,
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	Because now we live , if you stand in the Lord .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we return to God for you , in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God ,
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face , and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith ?
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	And may the Lord multiply you , and make you abound in charity towards one another , and towards all men : as we do also towards you ,

DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God , your sanctification ; that you should abstain from fornication ;
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the passion of lust , like the Gentiles that know not God :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	And that no man overreach , nor circumvent his brother in business : because the Lord is the avenger of all these things , as we have told you before , and have testified .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto sanctification .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	Therefore , he that despiseth these things , despiseth not man , but God , who also hath given his holy Spirit in us .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching the charity of brotherhood , we have no need to write to you : for yourselves have learned of God to love one another .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia . But we entreat you , brethren , that you abound more :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	And that you use your endeavour to be quiet , and that you do your own business , and work with your own hands , as we commanded you : and that you walk honestly towards them that are without ; and that you want nothing of any man 's .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	And we will not have you ignorant , brethren , concerning them that are asleep , that you be not sorrowful , even as others who have no hope .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	For if we believe that Jesus died , and rose again ; even so them who have slept through Jesus , will God bring with him .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who remain unto the coming of the Lord , shall not prevent them who have slept .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment , and with the voice of an archangel , and with the trumpet of God : and the dead who are in Christ , shall rise first .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	Then we who are alive , who are left , shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ , into the air , and so shall we be always with the Lord .

DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly , that the day of the Lord shall so come , as a thief in the night .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say , peace and security ; then shall sudden destruction come upon them , as the pains upon her that is with child , and they shall not escape .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But you , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore , let us not sleep , as others do ; but let us watch , and be sober .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep , sleep in the night ; and they that are drunk , are drunk in the night .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But let us , who are of the day , be sober , having on the breastplate of faith and charity , and for a helmet the hope of salvation .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us unto wrath , but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us ; that , whether we watch or sleep , we may live together with him .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	For which cause comfort one another ; and edify one another , as you also do .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you , brethren , to know them who labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you :
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	That you esteem them more abundantly in charity , for their work 's sake . Have peace with them .
DRA	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	And we beseech you , brethren , rebuke the unquiet , comfort the feeble minded , support the weak , be patient towards all men .

DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to give thanks always to God for you , brethren , as it is fitting , because your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you towards each other , aboundeth :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God , for your patience and faith , and in all your persecutions and tribulations , which you endure ,
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	For an example of the just judgment of God , that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which also you suffer .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them that trouble you :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	And to you who are troubled , rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven , with the angels of his power :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	In a flame of fire , giving vengeance to them who know not God , and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	Who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction , from the face of the Lord , and from the glory of his power :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be made wonderful in all them who have believed ; because our testimony was believed upon you in that day .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	Wherefore also we pray always for you ; that our God would make you worthy of his vocation , and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith in power ;
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you , and you in him , according to the grace of our God , and of the Lord Jesus Christ . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	That you be not easily moved from your sense , nor be terrified , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by epistle , as sent from us , as if the day of the Lord were at hand .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means , for unless there come a revolt first , and the man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ,
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposeth , and is lifted up above all that is called God , or that is worshipped , so that he sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself as if he were God .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Remember you not , that when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now you know what withholdeth , that he may be revealed in his time .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity already worketh ; only that he who now holdeth , do hold , until he be taken out of the way .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then that wicked one shall be revealed whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth ; and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming , him ,
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	Whose coming is according to the working of Satan , in all power , and signs , and lying wonders ,
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish ; because they receive not the love of the truth , that they might be saved . Therefore God shall send them the operation of error , to believe lying :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	That all may be judged who have not believed the truth , but have consented to iniquity .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	But we ought to give thanks to God always for you , brethren , beloved of God , for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation , in sanctification of the spirit , and faith of the truth :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel , unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	Therefore , brethren , stand fast ; and hold the traditions which you have learned , whether by word , or by our epistle .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God and our Father , who hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation , and good hope in grace ,
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Exhort your hearts , and confirm you in every good work and word . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men ; for all men have not faith .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But God is faithful , who will strengthen and keep you from evil .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord , that the things which we command , you both do , and will do .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	And the Lord direct your hearts , in the charity of God , and the patience of Christ .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	And we charge you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly , and not according to the tradition which they have received of us .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us : for we were not disorderly among you ;
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	Neither did we eat any man 's bread for nothing , but in labour and in toil we worked night and day , lest we should be chargeable to any of you .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	Not as if we had not power : but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you , to imitate us .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For also when we were with you , this we declared to you : that , if any man will not work , neither let him eat .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly , working not at all , but curiously meddling .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now we charge them that are such , and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ , that , working with silence , they would eat their own bread .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	But you , brethren , be not weary in well doing .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and do not keep company with him , that he may be ashamed :
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	Yet do not esteem him as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place . The Lord be with you all .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation of Paul with my own hand ; which is the sign in every epistle . So I write .
DRA	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the commandment of God our Saviour , and of Christ Jesus our hope :
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , his beloved son in faith . Grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father , and from Christ Jesus our Lord .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	4	Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies : which furnish questions rather than the edification of God , which is in faith .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity , from a pure heart , and a good conscience , and an unfeigned faith .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	6	From which things some going astray , are turned aside unto vain babbling :
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law , understanding neither the things they say , nor whereof they affirm .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully :
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	9	Knowing this , that the law is not made for the just man , but for the unjust and disobedient , for the ungodly , and for sinners , for the wicked and defiled , for murderers of fathers , and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	10	For fornicators , for them who defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	11	Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God , which hath been committed to my trust .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	12	I give thanks who hath strengthened me , even to Christ Jesus our Lord , for that he hath counted me faithful , putting me in the ministry ;
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	13	Who before was a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and contumelious . But I obtained the mercy of God , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	14	Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love , which is in Christ Jesus .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	15	A faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners , of whom I am the chief .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	16	But for this cause have I obtained mercy : that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience , for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now to the king of ages , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	18	This precept I commend to thee , O son Timothy ; according to the prophecies going before on thee , that thou war in them a good warfare ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	19	Having faith and a good conscience , which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith .
DRA	1%20Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander , whom I have delivered up to Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	2	For kings , and for all that are in high station : that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved , and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	5	For there is one God , and one mediator of God and men , the man Christ Jesus :
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	6	Who gave himself a redemption for all , a testimony in due times .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	7	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle , ( I say the truth , I lie not , ) a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that men pray in every place , lifting up pure hands , without anger and contention .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	9	In like manner women also in decent apparel : adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety , not with plaited hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly attire ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	10	But as it becometh women professing godliness , with good works .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence , with all subjection .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to use authority over the man : but to be in silence .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed ; then Eve .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not seduced ; but the woman being seduced , was in the transgression .
DRA	1%20Timothy	2	15	Yet she shall be saved through childbearing ; if she continue in faith , and love , and sanctification , with sobriety . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine , no striker , but modest , not quarrelsome , not covetous , but
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	2	It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless , the husband of one wife , sober , prudent , of good behaviour , chaste , given to hospitality , a teacher ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all chastity .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	5	But if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ?
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	6	Not a neophyte : lest being puffed up with pride , he fall into the judgment of the devil .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without : lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	8	Deacons in like manner chaste , not double tongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre :
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	9	Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved : and so let them minister , having no crime .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	11	The women in like manner chaste , not slanderers , but sober , faithful in all things .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let deacons be the husbands of one wife : who rule well their children , and their own houses .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	13	For they that have ministered well , shall purchase to themselves a good degree , and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	14	These things I write to thee , hoping that I shall come to thee shortly .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	15	But if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
DRA	1%20Timothy	3	16	And evidently great is the mystery of godliness , which was manifested in the flesh , was justified in the spirit , appeared unto angels , hath been preached unto the Gentiles , is believed in the world , is taken up in glory .

DRA	1%20Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good , and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving :
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy , and having their conscience seared ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	3	Forbidding to marry , to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful , and by them that have known the truth .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	6	These things proposing to the brethren , thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus , nourished up in the words of faith , and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	7	But avoid foolish and old wives ' fables : and exercise thyself unto godliness .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise is profitable to little : but godliness is profitable to all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	9	A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	10	For therefore we labor and are reviled , because we hope in the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , especially of the faithful .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth : but be thou an example of the faithful in word , in conversation , in charity , in faith , in chastity .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	13	Till I come , attend unto reading , to exhortation , and to doctrine .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the grace that is in thee , which was given thee by prophesy , with imposition of the hands of the priesthood .
DRA	1%20Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things , be wholly in these things : that thy profiting may be manifest to all .

DRA	1%20Timothy	5	5	But she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , let her trust in God , and continue in supplications and prayers night and day .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	2	Old women , as mothers : young women , as sisters , in all chastity .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honour widows , that are widows indeed .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if any widow have children , or grandchildren , let her learn first to govern her own house , and to make a return of duty to her parents : for this is acceptable before God .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	6	For she that liveth in pleasures , is dead while she is living .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	7	And this give in charge , that they may be blameless .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if any man have not care of his own , and especially of those of his house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age , who hath been the wife of one husband .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	10	Having testimony for her good works , if she have brought up children , if she have received to harbour , if she have washed the saints ' feet , if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation , if she have diligently followed every good work .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows avoid . For when they have grown wanton in Christ , they will marry :
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	12	Having damnation , because they have made void their first faith .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	13	And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house : and are not only idle , but tattlers also , and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	14	I will therefore that the younger should marry , bear children , be mistresses of families , give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any of the faithful have widows , let him minister to them , and let not the church be charged : that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the priests that rule well , be esteemed worthy of double honour : especially they who labour in the word and doctrine :
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the scripture saith : Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn : and , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	19	Against a priest receive not an accusation , but under two or three witnesses .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	20	Them that sin reprove before all : that the rest also may have fear .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge thee before God , and Christ Jesus , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by declining to either side .
DRA	1%20Timothy	5	22	Impose not hands lightly upon any man , neither be partaker of other men 's sins . Keep thyself chaste .

DRA	1%20Timothy	5	24	Some men 's sins are manifest , going before to judgment : and some men they follow after .

DRA	1%20Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	2	But they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but serve them the rather , because they are faithful and beloved , who are partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to that doctrine which is according to godliness ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	4	He is proud , knowing nothing , but sick about questions and strifes of words ; from which arise envies , contentions , blasphemies , evil suspicions ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	5	Conflicts of men corrupted in mind , and who are destitute of the truth , supposing gain to be godliness .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world : and certainly we can carry nothing out .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	8	But having food , and wherewith to be covered , with these we are content .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	9	For they that will become rich , fall into temptation , and into the snare of the devil , and into many unprofitable and hurtful desires , which drown men into destruction and perdition .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the desire of money is the root of all evils ; which some coveting have erred from the faith , and have entangled themselves in many sorrows .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	11	But thou , O man of God , fly these things : and pursue justice , godliness , faith , charity , patience , mildness .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith : lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art called , and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	13	I charge thee before God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate , a good confession ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	14	That thou keep the commandment without spot , blameless , unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew who is the Blessed and only Mighty , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	16	Who only hath immortality , and inhabiteth light inaccessible , whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and empire everlasting . Amen .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	17	Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded , nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches , but in the living God , ( who giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy , )
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	18	To do good , to be rich in good works , to give easily , to communicate to others ,
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	19	To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on the true life .
DRA	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timothy , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding the profane novelties of words , and oppositions of knowledge falsely so called .

DRA	2%20Timothy	1	3	I give thanks to God , whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience , that without ceasing , I have a remembrance of thee in my prayers , night and day .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	4	Desiring to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that I may be filled with joy ,
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	5	Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned , which also dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and in thy mother Eunice , and I am certain that in thee also .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	6	For which cause I admonish thee , that thou stir up the grace of God which is in thee , by the imposition of my hands .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear : but of power , and of love , and of sobriety .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner : but labour with the gospel , according to the power of God ,
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	9	Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	10	But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus Christ , who hath destroyed death , and hath brought to light life and incorruption by the gospel :
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	11	Wherein I am appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and teacher of the Gentiles .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	12	For which cause I also suffer these things : but I am not ashamed . For I know whom I have believed , and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him , against that day .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	13	Hold the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me in faith , and in the love which is in Christ Jesus .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	14	Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost , who dwelleth in us .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	15	Thou knowest this , that all they who are in Asia , are turned away from me : of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	16	The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus : because he hath often refreshed me , and hath not been ashamed of my chain :
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	17	But when he was come to Rome , he carefully sought me , and found me .
DRA	2%20Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou very well knowest . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	2%20Timothy	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	3	Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	4	No man , being a soldier to God , entangleth himself with secular businesses ; that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	5	For he also that striveth for the mastery , is not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	6	The husbandman , that laboureth , must first partake of the fruits .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	7	Understand what I say : for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	8	Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead , of the seed of David , according to my gospel .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	9	Wherein I labour even unto bands , as an evildoer ; but the word of God is not bound .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect , that they also may obtain the salvation , which is in Christ Jesus , with heavenly glory .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	11	A faithful saying : for if we be dead with him , we shall live also with him .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we suffer , we shall also reign with him . If we deny him , he will also deny us .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we believe not , he continueth faithful , he can not deny himself .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	14	Of these things put them in mind , charging them before the Lord . Contend not in words , for it is to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	15	Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	16	But shun profane and vain babblings : for they grow much towards ungodliness .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	17	And their speech spreadeth like a canker : of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus :
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	18	Who have erred from the truth , saying , that the resurrection is past already , and have subverted the faith of some .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	19	But the sure foundation of God standeth firm , having this seal : the Lord knoweth who are his ; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver , but also of wood and earth : and some indeed unto honour , but some unto dishonour .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	21	If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified and profitable to the Lord , prepared unto every good work .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	22	But flee thou youthful desires , and pursue justice , faith , charity , and peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	23	And avoid foolish and unlearned questions , knowing that they beget strifes .
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	24	But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle : but be mild towards all men , apt to teach , patient ,
DRA	2%20Timothy	2	25	With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth : if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth ,

DRA	2%20Timothy	3	3	Without affection , without peace , slanderers , incontinent , unmerciful , without kindness ,
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	4	Traitors , stubborn , puffed up , and lovers of pleasures more than of God :
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	5	Having an appearance indeed of godliness , but denying the power thereof . Now these avoid .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	6	For of these sort are they who creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , who are led away with divers desires :
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	7	Ever learning , and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	8	Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses , so these also resist the truth , men corrupted in mind , reprobate concerning the faith .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they shall proceed no farther ; for their folly shall be manifest to all men , as theirs also was .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , love , patience ,
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	11	Persecutions , afflictions : such as came upon me at Antioch , at Iconium , and at Lystra : what persecutions I endured , and out of them all the Lord delivered me .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	12	And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus , shall suffer persecution .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	13	But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse : erring , and driving into error .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	14	But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned , and which have been committed to thee : knowing of whom thou hast learned them ;
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	15	And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures , which can instruct thee to salvation , by the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
DRA	2%20Timothy	3	16	All scripture , inspired of God , is profitable to teach , to reprove , to correct , to instruct in justice ,

DRA	2%20Timothy	4	4	And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth , but will be turned unto fables .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	3	For there shall be a time , when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but , according to their own desires , they will heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears :
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	5	But be thou vigilant , labour in all things , do the work of an evangelist , fulfill thy ministry . Be sober .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	6	For I am even now ready to be sacrificed : and the time of my dissolution is at hand .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	8	As to the rest , there is laid up for me a crown of justice , which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day : and not only to me , but to them also that love his coming . Make haste to come to me quickly .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	9	For Demas hath left me , loving this world , and is gone to Thessalonica :

DRA	2%20Timothy	4	13	The cloak that I left at Troas , with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , especially the parchments .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil : the Lord will reward him according to his works :
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	15	Whom do thou also avoid , for he hath greatly withstood our words .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first answer no man stood with me , but all forsook me : may it not be laid to their charge .
DRA	2%20Timothy	4	17	But the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that by me the preaching may be accomplished , and that all the Gentiles may hear : and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .

DRA	Titus	1	1	Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth , which is according to godliness :
DRA	Titus	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Titus	1	2	Unto the hope of life everlasting , which God , who lieth not , hath promised before the times of the world :
DRA	Titus	1	3	But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching , which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Saviour :
DRA	Titus	1	4	To Titus my beloved son , according to the common faith , grace and peace from God the Father , and from Christ Jesus our Saviour .
DRA	Titus	1	5	For this cause I left thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and shouldest ordain priests in every city , as I also appointed thee :
DRA	Titus	1	6	If any be without crime , the husband of one wife , having faithful children , not accused of riot , or unruly .
DRA	Titus	1	7	For a bishop must be without crime , as the steward of God : not proud , not subject to anger , not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre :
DRA	Titus	1	8	But given to hospitality , gentle , sober , just , holy , continent :
DRA	Titus	1	9	Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine , that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine , and to convince the gainsayers .
DRA	Titus	1	10	For there are also many disobedient , vain talkers , and seducers : especially they who are of the circumcision :
DRA	Titus	1	11	Who must be reproved , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre 's sake .
DRA	Titus	1	12	One of them a prophet of their own , said , The Cretians are always liars , evil beasts , slothful bellies .
DRA	Titus	1	13	This testimony is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
DRA	Titus	1	14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men , who turn themselves away from the truth .
DRA	Titus	1	15	All things are clean to the clean : but to them that are defiled , and to unbelievers , nothing is clean : but both their mind and their conscience are defiled .
DRA	Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God : but in their works they deny him ; being abominable , and incredulous , and to every good work reprobate . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Titus	2	2	That the aged men be sober , chaste , prudent , sound in faith , in love , in patience .
DRA	Titus	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Titus	2	3	The aged women , in like manner , in holy attire , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teaching well :
DRA	Titus	2	4	That they may teach the young women to be wise , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
DRA	Titus	2	5	To be discreet , chaste , sober , having a care of the house , gentle , obedient to their husbands , that the word of God be not blasphemed .
DRA	Titus	2	6	Young men , in like manner , exhort that they be sober .
DRA	Titus	2	7	In all things shew thyself an example of good works , in doctrine , in integrity , in gravity ,
DRA	Titus	2	8	The sound word that can not be blamed : that he , who is on the contrary part , may be afraid , having no evil to say of us .
DRA	Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters , in all things pleasing , not gainsaying :
DRA	Titus	2	10	Not defrauding , but in all things shewing good fidelity , that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things :
DRA	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God our Saviour hath appeared to all men ;
DRA	Titus	2	12	Instructing us , that , denying ungodliness and worldly desires , we should live soberly , and justly , and godly in this world ,
DRA	Titus	2	13	Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Titus	2	14	Who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable , a pursuer of good works .
DRA	Titus	2	15	These things speak , and exhort and rebuke with all authority . Let no man despise thee . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Titus	3	3	For we ourselves also were some time unwise , incredulous , erring , slaves to divers desires and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
DRA	Titus	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Titus	3	2	To speak evil of no man , not to be litigious , but gentle : shewing all mildness towards all men .
DRA	Titus	3	4	But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared :
DRA	Titus	3	5	Not by the works of justice , which we have done , but according to his mercy , he saved us , by the laver of regeneration , and renovation of the Holy Ghost ;
DRA	Titus	3	6	Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly , through Jesus Christ our Saviour :
DRA	Titus	3	7	That , being justified by his grace , we may be heirs , according to hope of life everlasting .
DRA	Titus	3	8	It is a faithful saying : and these things I will have thee affirm constantly : that they , who believe in God , may be careful to excel in good works . These things are good and profitable unto men .
DRA	Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and strivings about the law . For they are unprofitable and vain .
DRA	Titus	3	10	A man that is a heretic , after the first and second admonition , avoid :
DRA	Titus	3	11	Knowing that he , that is such an one , is subverted , and sinneth , being condemned by his own judgment .
DRA	Titus	3	12	When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus , make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis . For there I have determined to winter .
DRA	Titus	3	13	Send forward Zenas , the lawyer , and Apollo , with care , that nothing be wanting to them .
DRA	Titus	3	14	And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses : that they be not unfruitful .
DRA	Titus	3	15	All that are with me salute thee : salute them that love us in the faith . The grace of God be with you all . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Philemon	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Philemon	1	1	Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus , and Timothy , a brother : to Philemon , our beloved and fellow labourer ;
DRA	Philemon	1	2	And to Appia , our dearest sister , and to Archippus , our fellow soldier , and to the church which is in thy house :
DRA	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	Philemon	1	4	I give thanks to my God , always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers .
DRA	Philemon	1	5	Hearing of thy charity and faith , which thou hast in the Lord Jesus , and towards all the saints :
DRA	Philemon	1	6	That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work , that is in you in Christ Jesus .
DRA	Philemon	1	7	For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity , because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee , brother .
DRA	Philemon	1	8	Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus , to command thee that which is to the purpose :
DRA	Philemon	1	9	For charity sake I rather beseech , whereas thou art such a one , as Paul an old man , and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ .
DRA	Philemon	1	10	I beseech thee for my son , whom I have begotten in my bands , Onesimus ,
DRA	Philemon	1	11	Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee , but now is profitable both to me and thee ,
DRA	Philemon	1	12	Whom I have sent back to thee . And do thou receive him as my own bowels .
DRA	Philemon	1	13	Whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel :
DRA	Philemon	1	14	But without thy counsel I would do nothing : that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity , but voluntary .
DRA	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee , that thou mightest receive him again for ever :
DRA	Philemon	1	16	Not now as a servant , but instead of a servant , a most dear brother , especially to me : but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord ?
DRA	Philemon	1	17	If therefore thou count me a partner , receive him as myself .
DRA	Philemon	1	18	And if he hath wronged thee in any thing , or is in thy debt , put that to my account .
DRA	Philemon	1	19	I Paul have written it with my own hand : I will repay it : not to say to thee , that thou owest me thy own self also .
DRA	Philemon	1	20	Yea , brother . May I enjoy thee in the Lord . Refresh my bowels in the Lord .
DRA	Philemon	1	21	Trusting in thy obedience , I have written to thee : knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
DRA	Philemon	1	22	But withal prepare me also a lodging . For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
DRA	Philemon	1	23	There salute thee Epaphras , my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus ;
DRA	Philemon	1	24	Mark , Aristarchus , Demas , and Luke my fellow labourers .
DRA	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	1	1	God , who , at sundry times and in divers manners , spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets , last of all ,
DRA	Hebrews	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	1	2	In these days hath spoken to us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the world .
DRA	Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory , and the figure of his substance , and upholding all things by the word of his power , making purgation of sins , sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high .
DRA	Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they .
DRA	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels hath he said at any time , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee ? And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
DRA	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world , he saith : And let all the angels of God adore him .
DRA	Hebrews	1	7	And to the angels indeed he saith : He that maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
DRA	Hebrews	1	8	But to the Son : Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
DRA	Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved justice , and hated iniquity : therefore God , thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
DRA	Hebrews	1	10	And : Thou in the beginning , O Lord , didst found the earth : and the works of thy hands are the heavens .
DRA	Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish , but thou shalt continue : and they shall all grow old as a garment .
DRA	Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou change them , and they shall be changed : but thou art the selfsame , and thy years shall not fail .
DRA	Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time : Sit on my right hand , until I make thy enemies thy footstool ?
DRA	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent to minister for them , who shall receive the inheritance of salvation ? Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word , spoken by angels , became steadfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward :
DRA	Hebrews	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation ? which having begun to be declared by the Lord , was confirmed unto us by them that heard him .
DRA	Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness by signs , and wonders , and divers miracles , and distributions of the Holy Ghost , according to his own will .
DRA	Hebrews	2	5	For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come , whereof we speak .
DRA	Hebrews	2	6	But one in a certain place hath testified , saying : What is man , that thou art mindful of him : or the son of man , that thou visitest him ?
DRA	Hebrews	2	7	Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels : thou hast crowned him with glory and honour , and hast set him over the works of thy hands :
DRA	Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast subjected all things under his feet . For in that he hath subjected all things to him , he left nothing not subject to him . But now we see not as yet all things subject to him .
DRA	Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels , for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour : that , through the grace of God , he might taste death for all .
DRA	Hebrews	2	10	For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , who had brought many children into glory , to perfect the author of their salvation , by his passion .
DRA	Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth , and they who are sanctified , are all of one . For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren , saying :
DRA	Hebrews	2	12	I will declare thy name to my brethren ; in the midst of the church will I praise thee .
DRA	Hebrews	2	13	And again : I will put my trust in him . And again : Behold I and my children , whom God hath given me .
DRA	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same : that , through death , he might destroy him who had the empire of death , that is to say , the devil :
DRA	Hebrews	2	15	And might deliver them , who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude .
DRA	Hebrews	2	16	For no where doth he take hold of the angels : but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold .
DRA	Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren , that he might become a merciful and faithful priest before God , that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people .
DRA	Hebrews	2	18	For in that , wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted , he is able to succour them also that are tempted . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses , by so much as he that hath built the house , hath greater honour than the house .
DRA	Hebrews	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	3	2	Who is faithful to him that made him , as was also Moses in all his house .
DRA	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by some man : but he that created all things , is God .
DRA	Hebrews	3	5	And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be said :
DRA	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ as the Son in his own house : which house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end .
DRA	Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore , as the Holy Ghost saith : To day if you shall hear his voice ,
DRA	Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts , as in the provocation ; in the day of temptation in the desert ,
DRA	Hebrews	3	9	Where your fathers tempted me , proved and saw my works ,
DRA	Hebrews	3	10	Forty years : for which cause I was offended with this generation , and I said : They always err in heart . And they have not known my ways ,
DRA	Hebrews	3	11	As I have sworn in my wrath : If they shall enter into my rest .
DRA	Hebrews	3	12	Take heed , brethren , lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , to depart from the living God .
DRA	Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another every day , whilst it is called to day , that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
DRA	Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ : yet so , if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end .
DRA	Hebrews	3	15	While it is said , To day if you shall hear his voice , harden not your hearts , as in that provocation .
DRA	Hebrews	3	16	For some who heard did provoke : but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
DRA	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he offended forty years ? Was it not with them that sinned , whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert ?
DRA	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did he swear , that they should not enter into his rest : but to them that were incredulous ?
DRA	Hebrews	3	19	And we see that they could not enter in , because of unbelief . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	4	4	For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus : And God rested the seventh day from all his works .
DRA	Hebrews	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	4	2	For unto us also it hath been declared , in like manner as unto them . But the word of hearing did not profit them , not being mixed with faith of those things they heard .
DRA	Hebrews	4	3	For we , who have believed , shall enter into rest ; as he said : As I have sworn in my wrath ; If they shall enter into my rest ; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished .
DRA	Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again : If they shall enter into my rest .
DRA	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it , and they , to whom it was first preached , did not enter because of unbelief :
DRA	Hebrews	4	7	Again he limiteth a certain day , saying in David , To day , after so long a time , as it is above said : To day if you shall hear his voice , harden not your hearts .
DRA	Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest , he would never have afterwards spoken of another day .
DRA	Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God .
DRA	Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest , the same also hath rested from his works , as God did from his .
DRA	Hebrews	4	11	Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest ; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief .
DRA	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living and effectual , and more piercing than any two edged sword ; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit , of the joints also and the marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
DRA	Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight : but all things are naked and open to his eyes , to whom our speech is .
DRA	Hebrews	4	14	Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God : let us hold fast our confession .
DRA	Hebrews	4	15	For we have not a high priest , who can not have compassion on our infirmities : but one tempted in all things like as we are , without sin .
DRA	Hebrews	4	16	Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace : that we may obtain mercy , and find grace in seasonable aid . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	5	5	So Christ also did not glorify himself , that he might be made a high priest : but he that said unto him : Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee .
DRA	Hebrews	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err : because he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
DRA	Hebrews	5	3	And therefore he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
DRA	Hebrews	5	4	Neither doth any man take the honour to himself , but he that is called by God , as Aaron was .
DRA	Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place : Thou art a priest for ever , according to the order of Melchisedech .
DRA	Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh , with a strong cry and tears , offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death , was heard for his reverence .
DRA	Hebrews	5	8	And whereas indeed he was the Son of God , he learned obedience by the things which he suffered :
DRA	Hebrews	5	9	And being consummated , he became , to all that obey him , the cause of eternal salvation .
DRA	Hebrews	5	10	Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech .
DRA	Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have much to say , and hard to be intelligibly uttered : because you are become weak to hear .
DRA	Hebrews	5	12	For whereas for the time you ought to be masters , you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God : and you are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
DRA	Hebrews	5	13	For every one that is a partaker of milk , is unskillful in the word of justice : for he is a little child .
DRA	Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat is for the perfect ; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms , and imposition of hands , and of the resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
DRA	Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do , if God permit .
DRA	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated , have tasted also the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost ,
DRA	Hebrews	6	5	Have moreover tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the world to come ,
DRA	Hebrews	6	7	For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled , receiveth blessing from God .
DRA	Hebrews	6	8	But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers , is reprobate , and very near unto a curse , whose end is to be burnt .
DRA	Hebrews	6	9	But , my dearly beloved , we trust better things of you , and nearer to salvation ; though we speak thus .
DRA	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust , that he should forget your work , and the love which you have shewn in his name , you who have ministered , and do minister to the saints .
DRA	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end :
DRA	Hebrews	6	12	That you become not slothful , but followers of them , who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises .
DRA	Hebrews	6	13	For God making promise to Abraham , because he had no one greater by whom he might swear , swore by himself ,
DRA	Hebrews	6	14	Saying : Unless blessing I shall bless thee , and multiplying I shall multiply thee .
DRA	Hebrews	6	15	And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise .
DRA	Hebrews	6	16	For men swear by one greater than themselves : and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy .
DRA	Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God , meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed an oath :
DRA	Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we may have the strongest comfort , who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us .
DRA	Hebrews	6	19	Which we have as an anchor of the soul , sure and firm , and which entereth in even within the veil ;

DRA	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but likened unto the Son of God , continueth a priest for ever .
DRA	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man is , to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things .
DRA	Hebrews	7	5	And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is to say , of their brethren : though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham .
DRA	Hebrews	7	6	But he , whose pedigree is not numbered among them , received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
DRA	Hebrews	7	8	And here indeed , men that die , receive thithes : but there he hath witness , that he liveth .
DRA	Hebrews	7	9	And ( as it may be said ) even Levi who received tithes , paid tithes in Abraham :
DRA	Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedech met him .
DRA	Hebrews	7	11	If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech , and not be called according to the order of Aaron ?
DRA	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being translated , it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law .
DRA	Hebrews	7	13	For he , of whom these things are spoken , is of another tribe , of which no one attended on the altar .
DRA	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda : in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests .
DRA	Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident : if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest ,
DRA	Hebrews	7	16	Who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment , but according to the power of an indissoluble life :
DRA	Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth : Thou art a priest for ever , according to the order of Melchisedech .
DRA	Hebrews	7	18	There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment , because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof :
DRA	Hebrews	7	19	( For the law brought nothing to perfection , ) but a bringing in of a better hope , by which we draw nigh to God .
DRA	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as it is not without an oath , ( for the others indeed were made priests without an oath ;
DRA	Hebrews	7	21	But this with an oath , by him that said unto him : The Lord hath sworn , and he will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever . )
DRA	Hebrews	7	22	By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
DRA	Hebrews	7	23	And the others indeed were made many priests , because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue :
DRA	Hebrews	7	24	But this , for that he continueth for ever , hath an everlasting priesthood ,
DRA	Hebrews	7	25	Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him ; always living to make intercession for us .
DRA	Hebrews	7	26	For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest , holy , innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
DRA	Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily ( as the other priests ) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , in offering himself .
DRA	Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men priests , who have infirmity : but the word of the oath , which was since the law , the Son who is perfected for evermore . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them , he saith : Behold , the days shall come , saith the Lord : and I will perfect unto the house of Israel , and unto the house of Juda , a new testament :
DRA	Hebrews	8	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the holies , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord hath pitched , and not man .
DRA	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer .
DRA	Hebrews	8	4	If then he were on earth , he would not be a priest : seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law ,
DRA	Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things . As it was answered to Moses , when he was to finish the tabernacle : See ( saith he ) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount .
DRA	Hebrews	8	6	But now he hath obtained a better ministry , by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament , which is established on better promises .
DRA	Hebrews	8	7	For if that former had been faultless , there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second .
DRA	Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers , on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt : because they continued not in my testament : and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
DRA	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord : I will give my laws into their mind , and in their heart will I write them : and I will be their God , and they shall be my people :
DRA	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them :
DRA	Hebrews	8	12	Because I will be merciful to their iniquities , and their sins I will remember no more .
DRA	Hebrews	8	13	Now in saying a new , he hath made the former old . And that which decayeth and groweth old , is near its end . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	9	9	Which is a parable of the time present : according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered , which can not , as to the conscience , make him perfect that serveth , only in meats and in drinks ,
DRA	Hebrews	9	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made the first , wherein were the candlesticks , and the table , and the setting forth of loaves , which is called the holy .
DRA	Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil , the tabernacle , which is called the holy of holies :
DRA	Hebrews	9	4	Having a golden censer , and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold , in which was a golden pot that had manna , and the rod of Aaron , that had blossomed , and the tables of the testament .
DRA	Hebrews	9	5	And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory : of which it is not needful to speak now particularly .
DRA	Hebrews	9	6	Now these things being thus ordered , into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered , accomplishing the offices of sacrifices .
DRA	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second , the high priest alone , once a year : not without blood , which he offereth for his own , and the people 's ignorance :
DRA	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost signifying this , that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest , whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing .
DRA	Hebrews	9	10	And divers washings , and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction .
DRA	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ , being come an high priest of the good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand , that is , not of this creation :
DRA	Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats , or of calves , but by his own blood , entered once into the holies , having obtained eternal redemption .
DRA	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and of oxen , and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled , sanctify such as are defiled , to the cleansing of the flesh :
DRA	Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ , who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God , cleanse our conscience from dead works , to serve the living God ?
DRA	Hebrews	9	15	And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament : that by means of his death , for the redemption of those transgressions , which were under the former testament , they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
DRA	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a testament , the death of the testator must of necessity come in .
DRA	Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force , after men are dead : otherwise it is as yet of no strength , whilst the testator liveth .
DRA	Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood .
DRA	Hebrews	9	19	For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , with water , and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
DRA	Hebrews	9	20	Saying : This is the blood of the testament , which God hath enjoined unto you .
DRA	Hebrews	9	21	The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry , in like manner , he sprinkled with blood .
DRA	Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things , according to the law , are cleansed with blood : and without shedding of blood there is no remission .
DRA	Hebrews	9	23	It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these : but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
DRA	Hebrews	9	24	For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands , the patterns of the true : but into heaven itself , that he may appear now in the presence of God for us .
DRA	Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holies , every year with the blood of others :
DRA	Hebrews	9	26	For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world : but now once at the end of ages , he hath appeared for the destruction of sin , by the sacrifice of himself .
DRA	Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die , and after this the judgment :
DRA	Hebrews	9	28	So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many ; the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	10	10	In the which will , we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once .
DRA	Hebrews	10	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	10	2	For then they would have ceased to be offered : because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer :
DRA	Hebrews	10	3	But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year .
DRA	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away .
DRA	Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith : Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not : but a body thou hast fitted to me :
DRA	Hebrews	10	6	Holocausts for sin did not please thee .
DRA	Hebrews	10	7	Then said I : Behold I come : in the head of the book it is written of me : that I should do thy will , O God .
DRA	Hebrews	10	8	In saying before , Sacrifices , and oblations , and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not , neither are they pleasing to thee , which are offered according to the law .
DRA	Hebrews	10	9	Then said I : Behold , I come to do thy will , O God : he taketh away the first , that he may establish that which followeth .
DRA	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering , and often offering the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .
DRA	Hebrews	10	12	But this man offering one sacrifice for sins , for ever sitteth on the right hand of God ,
DRA	Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting , until his enemies be made his footstool .
DRA	Hebrews	10	14	For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
DRA	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us . For after that he said :
DRA	Hebrews	10	16	And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days , saith the Lord . I will give my laws in their hearts , and on their minds will I write them :
DRA	Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more .
DRA	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is a remission of these , there is no more an oblation for sin .
DRA	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore , brethren , a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ ;
DRA	Hebrews	10	20	A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ,
DRA	Hebrews	10	21	And a high priest over the house of God :
DRA	Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with clean water .
DRA	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering ( for he is faithful that hath promised ) ,
DRA	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another , to provoke unto charity and to good works :
DRA	Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking our assembly , as some are accustomed ; but comforting one another , and so much the more as you see the day approaching .
DRA	Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth , there is now left no sacrifice for sins ,
DRA	Hebrews	10	27	But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment , and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries .
DRA	Hebrews	10	28	A man making void the law of Moses , dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses :
DRA	Hebrews	10	29	How much more , do you think he deserveth worse punishments , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean , by which he was sanctified , and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace ?
DRA	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said : Vengeance belongeth to me , and I will repay . And again : The Lord shall judge his people .
DRA	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
DRA	Hebrews	10	32	But call to mind the former days , wherein , being illuminated , you endured a great fight of afflictions .
DRA	Hebrews	10	33	And on the one hand indeed , by reproaches and tribulations , were made a gazingstock ; and on the other , became companions of them that were used in such sort .
DRA	Hebrews	10	34	For you both had compassion on them that were in bands , and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods , knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance .
DRA	Hebrews	10	35	Do not therefore lose your confidence , which hath a great reward .
DRA	Hebrews	10	36	For patience is necessary for you ; that , doing the will of God , you may receive the promise .
DRA	Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little and a very little while , and he that is to come , will come , and will not delay .
DRA	Hebrews	10	38	But my just man liveth by faith ; but if he withdraw himself , he shall not please my soul .
DRA	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition , but of faith to the saving of the soul . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	Hebrews	11	11	By faith also Sara herself , being barren , received strength to conceive seed , even past the time of age ; because she believed that he was faithful who had promised ,
DRA	Hebrews	11	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	11	2	For by this the ancients obtained a testimony .
DRA	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God ; that from invisible things visible things might be made .
DRA	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain , by which he obtained a testimony that he was just , God giving testimony to his gifts ; and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
DRA	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Henoch was translated , that he should not see death ; and he was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had testimony that he pleased God .
DRA	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please God . For he that cometh to God , must believe that he is , and is a rewarder to them that seek him .
DRA	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noe , having received an answer concerning those things which as yet were not seen , moved with fear , framed the ark for the saving of his house , by the which he condemned the world ; and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith .
DRA	Hebrews	11	8	By faith he that is called Abraham , obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
DRA	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he abode in the land , dwelling in cottages , with Isaac and Jacob , the co-heirs of the same promise .
DRA	Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city that hath foundations ; whose builder and maker is God .
DRA	Hebrews	11	12	For which cause there sprung even from one ( and him as good as dead ) as the stars of heaven in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
DRA	Hebrews	11	13	All these died according to faith , not having received the promises , but beholding them afar off , and saluting them , and confessing that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth .
DRA	Hebrews	11	14	For they that say these things , do signify that they seek a country .
DRA	Hebrews	11	15	And truly if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out , they had doubtless time to return .
DRA	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better , that is to say , a heavenly country . Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God ; for he hath prepared for them a city .
DRA	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered Isaac : and he that had received the promises , offered up his only begotten son ;
DRA	Hebrews	11	18	( To whom it was said : In Isaac shall thy seed be called . )
DRA	Hebrews	11	19	Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead . Whereupon also he received him for a parable .
DRA	Hebrews	11	20	By faith also of things to come , Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau .
DRA	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and adored the top of his rod .
DRA	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , when he was dying , made mention of the going out of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
DRA	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months by his parents ; because they saw he was a comely babe , and they feared not the king 's edict .
DRA	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he was grown up , denied himself to be the son of Pharao 's daughter ;
DRA	Hebrews	11	25	Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God , than to have the pleasure of sin for a time ,
DRA	Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians . For he looked unto the reward .
DRA	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the fierceness of the king : for he endured as seeing him that is invisible .
DRA	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he celebrated the pasch , and the shedding of the blood ; that he , who destroyed the firstborn , might not touch them .
DRA	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red Sea , as by dry land : which the Egyptians attempting , were swallowed up .
DRA	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , by the going round them seven days .
DRA	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers , receiving the spies with peace .
DRA	Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I yet say ? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , Barac , Samson , Jephthe , David , Samuel , and the prophets :
DRA	Hebrews	11	33	Who by faith conquered kingdoms , wrought justice , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions ,
DRA	Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , recovered strength from weakness , became valiant in battle , put to flight the armies of foreigners :
DRA	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again . But others were racked , not accepting deliverance , that they might find a better resurrection .
DRA	Hebrews	11	36	And others had trial of mockeries and stripes , moreover also of bands and prisons .
DRA	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , they were cut asunder , they were tempted , they were put to death by the sword , they wandered about in sheepskins , in goatskins , being in want , distressed , afflicted :
DRA	Hebrews	11	38	Of whom the world was not worthy ; wandering in deserts , in mountains , and in dens , and in caves of the earth .
DRA	Hebrews	11	39	And all these being approved by the testimony of faith , received not the promise ;

DRA	Hebrews	12	12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ,
DRA	Hebrews	12	1899	American Edition
DRA	Hebrews	12	2	Looking on Jesus , the author and finisher of faith , who having joy set before him , endured the cross , despising the shame , and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God .
DRA	Hebrews	12	3	For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself ; that you be not wearied , fainting in your minds .
DRA	Hebrews	12	4	For you have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin :
DRA	Hebrews	12	5	And you have forgotten the consolation , which speaketh to you , as unto children , saying : My son , neglect not the discipline of the Lord ; neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him .
DRA	Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth , he chastiseth ; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
DRA	Hebrews	12	7	Persevere under discipline . God dealeth with you as with his sons ; for what son is there , whom the father doth not correct ?
DRA	Hebrews	12	8	But if you be without chastisement , whereof all are made partakers , then are you bastards , and not sons .
DRA	Hebrews	12	9	Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh , for instructors , and we reverenced them : shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits , and live ?
DRA	Hebrews	12	10	And they indeed for a few days , according to their own pleasure , instructed us : but he , for our profit , that we might receive his sanctification .
DRA	Hebrews	12	11	Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy , but sorrow : but afterwards it will yield , to them that are exercised by it , the most peaceable fruit of justice .
DRA	Hebrews	12	13	And make straight steps with your feet : that no one , halting , may go out of the way ; but rather be healed .
DRA	Hebrews	12	14	Follow peace with all men , and holiness : without which no man shall see God .
DRA	Hebrews	12	15	Looking diligently , lest any man be wanting to the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder , and by it many be defiled .
DRA	Hebrews	12	16	Lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau ; who for one mess , sold his first birthright .
DRA	Hebrews	12	17	For know ye that afterwards , when he desired to inherit the benediction , he was rejected ; for he found no place of repentance , although with tears he had sought it .
DRA	Hebrews	12	18	For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched , and a burning fire , and a whirlwind , and darkness , and storm ,
DRA	Hebrews	12	19	And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words , which they that heard excused themselves , that the word might not be spoken to them :
DRA	Hebrews	12	20	For they did not endure that which was said : And if so much as a beast shall touch the mount , it shall be stoned .
DRA	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was that which was seen , Moses said : I am frighted , and tremble .
DRA	Hebrews	12	22	But you are come to mount Sion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to the company of many thousands of angels ,
DRA	Hebrews	12	23	And to the church of the firstborn , who are written in the heavens , and to God the judge of all , and to the spirits of the just made perfect ,
DRA	Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new testament , and to the sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of Abel .
DRA	Hebrews	12	25	See that you refuse him not that speaketh . For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke upon the earth , much more shall not we , that turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven .
DRA	Hebrews	12	26	Whose voice then moved the earth ; but now he promiseth , saying : Yet once more , and I will move not only the earth , but heaven also .
DRA	Hebrews	12	27	And in that he saith , Yet once more , he signifieth the translation of the moveable things as made , that those things may remain which are immoveable .
DRA	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore receiving an immoveable kingdom , we have grace ; whereby let us serve , pleasing God , with fear and reverence .

DRA	Hebrews	13	3	Remember them that are in bands , as if you were bound with them ; and them that labour , as being yourselves also in the body .
DRA	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage honourable in all , and the bed undefiled . For fornicators and adulterers God will judge .
DRA	Hebrews	13	5	Let your manners be without covetousness , contented with such things as you have ; for he hath said : I will not leave thee , neither will I forsake thee .
DRA	Hebrews	13	6	So that we may confidently say : The Lord is my helper : I will not fear what man shall do to me .

DRA	Hebrews	13	9	Be not led away with various and strange doctrines . For it is best that the heart be established with grace , not with meats ; which have not profited those that walk in them .
DRA	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar , whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle .
DRA	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
DRA	Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people by his own blood , suffered without the gate .
DRA	Hebrews	13	14	For we have not here a lasting city , but we seek one that is to come .
DRA	Hebrews	13	15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God , that is to say , the fruit of lips confessing to his name .
DRA	Hebrews	13	16	And do not forget to do good , and to impart ; for by such sacrifices God 's favour is obtained .
DRA	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your prelates , and be subject to them . For they watch as being to render an account of your souls ; that they may do this with joy , and not with grief . For this is not expedient for you .
DRA	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . For we trust we have a good conscience , being willing to behave ourselves well in all things .
DRA	Hebrews	13	19	And I beseech you the more to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
DRA	Hebrews	13	20	And may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep , our Lord Jesus Christ , in the blood of the everlasting testament ,

DRA	James	1	2	My brethren , count it all joy , when you shall fall into divers temptations ;
DRA	James	1	3	Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
DRA	James	1	4	And patience hath a perfect work ; that you may be perfect and entire , failing in nothing .
DRA	James	1	5	But if any of you want wisdom , let him ask of God , who giveth to all men abundantly , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
DRA	James	1	6	But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea , which is moved and carried about by the wind .
DRA	James	1	7	Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord .
DRA	James	1	8	A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways .
DRA	James	1	9	But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation :
DRA	James	1	10	And the rich , in his being low ; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away .
DRA	James	1	11	For the sun rose with a burning heat , and parched the grass , and the flower thereof fell off , and the beauty of the shape thereof perished : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
DRA	James	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation ; for when he hath been proved , he shall receive a crown of life , which God hath promised to them that love him .
DRA	James	1	13	Let no man , when he is tempted , say that he is tempted by God . For God is not a tempter of evils , and he tempteth no man .
DRA	James	1	14	But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence , being drawn away and allured .
DRA	James	1	15	Then when concupiscence hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin . But sin , when it is completed , begetteth death .
DRA	James	1	16	Do not err , therefore , my dearest brethren .
DRA	James	1	17	Every best gift , and every perfect gift , is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom there is no change , nor shadow of alteration .
DRA	James	1	18	For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth , that we might be some beginning of his creatures .
DRA	James	1	19	You know , my dearest brethren . And let every man be swift to hear , but slow to speak , and slow to anger .
DRA	James	1	20	For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God .
DRA	James	1	21	Wherefore casting away all uncleanness , and abundance of naughtiness , with meekness receive the ingrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
DRA	James	1	22	But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
DRA	James	1	23	For if a man be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass .
DRA	James	1	24	For he beheld himself , and went his way , and presently forgot what manner of man he was .
DRA	James	1	25	But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty , and hath continued therein , not becoming a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work ; this man shall be blessed in his deed .
DRA	James	1	26	And if any man think himself to be religious , not bridling his tongue , but deceiving his own heart , this man 's religion is vain .
DRA	James	1	27	Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father , is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation : and to keep one 's self unspotted from this world . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	James	2	2	For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring , in fine apparel , and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire ,
DRA	James	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	James	2	3	And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel , and shall say to him : Sit thou here well ; but say to the poor man : Stand thou there , or sit under my footstool :
DRA	James	2	4	Do you not judge within yourselves , and are become judges of unjust thoughts ?
DRA	James	2	5	Hearken , my dearest brethren : hath not God chosen the poor in this world , rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him ?
DRA	James	2	6	But you have dishonoured the poor man . Do not the rich oppress you by might ? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats ?
DRA	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you ?
DRA	James	2	8	If then you fulfill the royal law , according to the scriptures , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ; you do well .
DRA	James	2	9	But if you have respect to persons , you commit sin , being reproved by the law as transgressors .
DRA	James	2	10	And whosoever shall keep the whole law , but offend in one point , is become guilty of all .
DRA	James	2	11	For he that said , Thou shalt not commit adultery , said also , Thou shalt not kill . Now if thou do not commit adultery , but shalt kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
DRA	James	2	12	So speak ye , and so do , as being to be judged by the law of liberty .
DRA	James	2	13	For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy . And mercy exalteth itself above judgment .
DRA	James	2	14	What shall it profit , my brethren , if a man say he hath faith , but hath not works ? Shall faith be able to save him ?
DRA	James	2	15	And if a brother or sister be naked , and want daily food :
DRA	James	2	16	And one of you say to them : Go in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body , what shall it profit ?
DRA	James	2	17	So faith also , if it have not works , is dead in itself .
DRA	James	2	18	But some man will say : Thou hast faith , and I have works : shew me thy faith without works ; and I will shew thee , by works , my faith .
DRA	James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God . Thou dost well : the devils also believe and tremble .
DRA	James	2	20	But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
DRA	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works , offering up Isaac his son upon the altar ?
DRA	James	2	22	Seest thou , that faith did co-operate with his works ; and by works faith was made perfect ?
DRA	James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled , saying : Abraham believed God , and it was reputed to him to justice , and he was called the friend of God .
DRA	James	2	24	Do you see that by works a man is justified ; and not by faith only ?
DRA	James	2	25	And in like manner also Rahab the harlot , was not she justified by works , receiving the messengers , and sending them out another way ?
DRA	James	2	26	For even as the body without the spirit is dead ; so also faith without works is dead . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	James	3	3	For if we put bits into the mouths of horses , that they may obey us , and we turn about their whole body .
DRA	James	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	James	3	2	For in many things we all offend . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man . He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body .
DRA	James	3	4	Behold also ships , whereas they are great , and are driven by strong winds , yet are they turned about with a small helm , whithersoever the force of the governor willeth .
DRA	James	3	5	Even so the tongue is indeed a little member , and boasteth great things . Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood .
DRA	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity . The tongue is placed among our members , which defileth the whole body , and inflameth the wheel of our nativity , being set on fire by hell .
DRA	James	3	7	For every nature of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and of the rest , is tamed , and hath been tamed , by the nature of man :
DRA	James	3	8	But the tongue no man can tame , an unquiet evil , full of deadly poison .
DRA	James	3	9	By it we bless God and the Father : and by it we curse men , who are made after the likeness of God .
DRA	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
DRA	James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth , out of the same hole , sweet and bitter water ?
DRA	James	3	12	Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear grapes ; or the vine , figs ? So neither can the salt water yield sweet .
DRA	James	3	13	Who is a wise man , and endued with knowledge among you ? Let him shew , by a good conversation , his work in the meekness of wisdom .
DRA	James	3	14	But if you have bitter zeal , and there be contentions in your hearts ; glory not , and be not liars against the truth .
DRA	James	3	15	For this is not wisdom , descending from above : but earthly , sensual , devilish .
DRA	James	3	16	For where envying and contention is , there is inconstancy , and every evil work .
DRA	James	3	17	But the wisdom , that is from above , first indeed is chaste , then peaceable , modest , easy to be persuaded , consenting to the good , full of mercy and good fruits , without judging , without dissimulation .
DRA	James	3	18	And the fruit of justice is sown in peace , to them that make peace . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )
DRA	James	4	4	Adulterers , know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God ? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world , becometh an enemy of God .
DRA	James	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	James	4	2	You covet , and have not : you kill , and envy , and can not obtain . You contend and war , and you have not , because you ask not .
DRA	James	4	3	You ask , and receive not ; because you ask amiss : that you may consume it on your concupiscences .
DRA	James	4	5	Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain : To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you ?
DRA	James	4	6	But he giveth greater grace . Wherefore he saith : God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
DRA	James	4	7	Be subject therefore to God , but resist the devil , and he will fly from you .
DRA	James	4	8	Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners : and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
DRA	James	4	9	Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned into mourning , and your joy into sorrow .
DRA	James	4	10	Be humbled in the sight of the Lord , and he will exalt you .
DRA	James	4	11	Detract not one another , my brethren . He that detracteth his brother , or he that judgeth his brother , detracteth the law , and judgeth the law . But if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
DRA	James	4	12	There is one lawgiver , and judge , that is able to destroy and to deliver .
DRA	James	4	13	But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour ? Behold , now you that say : To day or to morrow we will go into such a city , and there we will spend a year , and will traffic , and make our gain .
DRA	James	4	14	Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow .
DRA	James	4	15	For what is your life ? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while , and afterwards shall vanish away . For that you should say : If the Lord will , and if we shall live , we will do this or that .
DRA	James	4	16	But now you rejoice in your arrogancies . All such rejoicing is wicked .

DRA	James	5	5	You have feasted upon earth : and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts , in the day of slaughter .
DRA	James	5	1899	American Edition
DRA	James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted : and your garments are motheaten .
DRA	James	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered : and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you , and shall eat your flesh like fire . You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days .
DRA	James	5	4	Behold the hire of the labourers , who have reaped down your fields , which by fraud has been kept back by you , crieth : and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth .
DRA	James	5	6	You have condemned and put to death the Just One , and he resisted you not .
DRA	James	5	7	Be patient therefore , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth : patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain .
DRA	James	5	8	Be you therefore also patient , and strengthen your hearts : for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
DRA	James	5	9	Grudge not , brethren , one against another , that you may not be judged . Behold the judge standeth before the door .
DRA	James	5	10	Take , my brethren , for an example of suffering evil , of labour and patience , the prophets , who spoke in the name of the Lord .
DRA	James	5	11	Behold , we account them blessed who have endured . You have heard of the patience of Job , and you have seen the end of the Lord , that the Lord is merciful and compassionate .
DRA	James	5	12	But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , nor by the earth , nor by any other oath . But let your speech be , yea , yea : no , no : that you fall not under judgment .
DRA	James	5	13	Is any of you sad ? Let him pray . Is he cheerful in mind ? Let him sing .
DRA	James	5	14	Is any man sick among you ? Let him bring in the priests of the church , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord .
DRA	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man : and the Lord shall raise him up : and if he be in sins , they shall be forgiven him .
DRA	James	5	16	Confess therefore your sins one to another : and pray one for another , that you may be saved . For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much .
DRA	James	5	17	Elias was a man passible like unto us : and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth , and it rained not for three years and six months .
DRA	James	5	18	And he prayed again : and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
DRA	James	5	19	My brethren , if any of you err from the truth , and one convert him :
DRA	James	5	20	He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way , shall save his soul from death , and shall cover a multitude of sins . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20Peter	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Peter	1	2	According to the foreknowledge of God the Father , unto the sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace unto you and peace be multiplied .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope , by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
DRA	1%20Peter	1	4	Unto an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that can not fade , reserved in heaven for you ,
DRA	1%20Peter	1	5	Who , by the power of God , are kept by faith unto salvation , ready to be revealed in the last time .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	6	Wherein you shall greatly rejoice , if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	7	That the trial of your faith ( much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire ) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	8	Whom having not seen , you love : in whom also now , though you see him not , you believe : and believing shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified ;
DRA	1%20Peter	1	9	Receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	10	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently searched , who prophesied of the grace to come in you .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	11	Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify : when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ , and the glories that should follow :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	12	To whom it was revealed , that not to themselves , but to you they ministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have preached the gospel to you , the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven , on whom the angels desire to look .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	13	Wherefore having the loins of your mind girt up , being sober , trust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of Jesus Christ ,
DRA	1%20Peter	1	14	As children of obedience , not fashioned according to the former desires of your ignorance :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	15	But according to him that hath called you , who is holy , be you also in all manner of conversation holy :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	16	Because it is written : You shall be holy , for I am holy .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	17	And if you invoke as Father him who , without respect of persons , judgeth according to every one 's work : converse in fear during the time of your sojourning here .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	18	Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver , from your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	19	But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled ,
DRA	1%20Peter	1	20	Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but manifested in the last times for you ,
DRA	1%20Peter	1	21	Who through him are faithful in God , who raised him up from the dead , and hath given him glory , that your faith and hope might be in God .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	22	Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity , with a brotherly love , from a sincere heart love one another earnestly :
DRA	1%20Peter	1	23	Being born again not of corruptible seed , but incorruptible , by the word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever .
DRA	1%20Peter	1	24	For all flesh is as grass ; and all the glory thereof as the flower of grass . The grass is withered , and the flower thereof is fallen away .

DRA	1%20Peter	2	3	If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	4	Unto whom coming , as to a living stone , rejected indeed by men , but chosen and made honourable by God :
DRA	1%20Peter	2	5	Be you also as living stones built up , a spiritual house , a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	6	Wherefore it is said in the scripture : Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious . And he that shall believe in him , shall not be confounded .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	7	To you therefore that believe , he is honour : but to them that believe not , the stone which the builders rejected , the same is made the head of the corner :
DRA	1%20Peter	2	8	And a stone of stumbling , and a rock of scandal , to them who stumble at the word , neither do believe , whereunto also they are set .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	9	But you are a chosen generation , a kingly priesthood , a holy nation , a purchased people : that you may declare his virtues , who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light :
DRA	1%20Peter	2	10	Who in time past were not a people : but are now the people of God . Who had not obtained mercy ; but now have obtained mercy .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	11	Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul ,
DRA	1%20Peter	2	12	Having your conversation good among the Gentiles : that whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may , by the good works , which they shall behold in you , glorify God in the day of visitation .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	13	Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God 's sake : whether it be to the king as excelling ;
DRA	1%20Peter	2	14	Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of the good :
DRA	1%20Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God , that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
DRA	1%20Peter	2	16	As free , and not as making liberty a cloak for malice , but as the servants of God .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	17	Honour all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honour the king .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	18	Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear , not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	19	For this is thankworthy , if for conscience towards God , a man endure sorrows , suffering wrongfully .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	20	For what glory is it , if committing sin , and being buffeted for it , you endure ? But if doing well you suffer patiently ; this is thankworthy before God .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	21	For unto this are you called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving you an example that you should follow his steps .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	22	Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	23	Who , when he was reviled , did not revile : when he suffered , he threatened not : but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly .
DRA	1%20Peter	2	24	Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree : that we , being dead to sins , should live to justice : by whose stripes you were healed .

DRA	1%20Peter	3	3	Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair , or the wearing of gold , or the putting on of apparel :
DRA	1%20Peter	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Peter	3	2	Considering your chaste conversation with fear .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	4	But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit , which is rich in the sight of God .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	5	For after this manner heretofore the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands :
DRA	1%20Peter	3	6	As Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters you are , doing well , and not fearing any disturbance .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	7	Ye husbands , likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge , giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel , and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life : that your prayers be not hindered .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	8	And in fine , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , being lovers of the brotherhood , merciful , modest , humble :
DRA	1%20Peter	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil , nor railing for railing , but contrariwise , blessing : for unto this are you called , that you may inherit a blessing .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	10	For he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	11	Let him decline from evil , and do good : let him seek after peace and pursue it :
DRA	1%20Peter	3	12	Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just , and his ears unto their prayers : but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	13	And who is he that can hurt you , if you be zealous of good ?
DRA	1%20Peter	3	14	But if also you suffer any thing for justice ' sake , blessed are ye . And be not afraid of their fear , and be not troubled .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts , being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	16	But with modesty and fear , having a good conscience : that whereas they speak evil of you , they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better doing well ( if such be the will of God ) to suffer , than doing ill.
DRA	1%20Peter	3	18	Because Christ also died once for our sins , the just for the unjust : that he might offer us to God , being put to death indeed in the flesh , but enlivened in the spirit ,
DRA	1%20Peter	3	19	In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison :
DRA	1%20Peter	3	20	Which had been some time incredulous , when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe , when the ark was a building : wherein a few , that is , eight souls , were saved by water .
DRA	1%20Peter	3	21	Whereunto baptism being of the like form , now saveth you also : not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ .

DRA	1%20Peter	4	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20Peter	4	2	That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh , not after the desires of men , but according to the will of God .
DRA	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles , for them who have walked in riotousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and unlawful worshipping of idols .
DRA	1%20Peter	4	5	Who shall render account to him , who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
DRA	1%20Peter	4	6	For , for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead : that they might be judged indeed according to men , in the flesh ; but may live according to God , in the Spirit .
DRA	1%20Peter	4	7	But the end of all is at hand . Be prudent therefore , and watch in prayers .
DRA	1%20Peter	4	8	But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves : for charity covereth a multitude of sins .
DRA	1%20Peter	4	9	Using hospitality one towards another , without murmuring ,

DRA	1%20Peter	4	12	Dearly beloved , think not strange the burning heat which is to try you , as if some new thing happened to you ;

DRA	1%20Peter	4	14	If you be reproached for the name of Christ , you shall be blessed : for that which is of the honour , glory , and power of God , and that which is his Spirit , resteth upon you .

DRA	2%20Peter	1	6	And in knowledge , abstinence ; and in abstinence , patience ; and in patience , godliness ;
DRA	2%20Peter	1	7	And in godliness , love of brotherhood ; and in love of brotherhood , charity .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these things be with you and abound , they will make you to be neither empty nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	9	For he that hath not these things with him , is blind , and groping , having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	10	Wherefore , brethren , labour the more , that by good works you may make sure your calling and election . For doing these things , you shall not sin at any time .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	12	For which cause I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things : though indeed you know them , and are confirmed in the present truth .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	13	But I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	14	Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand , according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will endeavour , that you frequently have after my decease , whereby you may keep a memory of these things .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	16	For we have not by following artificial fables , made known to you the power , and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ ; but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father , honour and glory : this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory : This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	18	And this voice we heard brought from heaven , when we were with him in the holy mount .
DRA	2%20Peter	1	19	And we have the more firm prophetical word : whereunto you do well to attend , as to a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts :
DRA	2%20Peter	1	20	Understanding this first , that no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation .

DRA	2%20Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their riotousnesses , through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you . Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their perdition slumbereth not .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but delivered them , drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell , unto torments , to be reserved unto judgment :
DRA	2%20Peter	2	5	And spared not the original world , but preserved Noe , the eighth person , the preacher of justice , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	6	And reducing the cities of the Sodomites , and of the Gomorrhites , into ashes , condemned them to be overthrown , making them an example to those that should after act wickedly .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot , oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation of the wicked .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	8	For in sight and hearing he was just : dwelling among them , who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation , but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	10	And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government , audacious , self willed , they fear not to bring in sects , blaspheming .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	11	Whereas angels who are greater in strength and power , bring not against themselves a railing judgment .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	12	But these men , as irrational beasts , naturally tending to the snare and to destruction , blaspheming those things which they know not , shall perish in their corruption ,
DRA	2%20Peter	2	13	Receiving the reward of their injustice , counting for a pleasure the delights of a day : stains and spots , sporting themselves to excess , rioting in their feasts with you :
DRA	2%20Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not : alluring unstable souls , having their heart exercised with covetousness , children of malediction :
DRA	2%20Peter	2	15	Leaving the right way they have gone astray , having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor , who loved the wages of iniquity ,
DRA	2%20Peter	2	16	But had a check of his madness , the dumb beast used to the yoke , which speaking with man 's voice , forbade the folly of the prophet .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	17	These are fountains without water , and clouds tossed with whirlwinds , to whom the mist of darkness is reserved .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	18	For , speaking proud words of vanity , they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness , those who for a little while escape , such as converse in error :
DRA	2%20Peter	2	19	Promising them liberty , whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption . For by whom a man is overcome , of the same also he is the slave .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , flying from the pollutions of the world , through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they be again entangled in them and overcome : their latter state is become unto them worse than the former .
DRA	2%20Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice , than after they have known it , to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them .

DRA	2%20Peter	3	1899	American Edition
DRA	2%20Peter	3	4	Saying : Where is his promise or his coming ? for since the time that the fathers slept , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	5	For this they are wilfully ignorant of , that the heavens were before , and the earth out of water , and through water , consisting by the word of God .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	6	Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of the ungodly men .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	8	But of this one thing be not ignorant , my beloved , that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord delayeth not his promise , as some imagine , but dealeth patiently for your sake , not willing that any should perish , but that all should return to penance .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief , in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence , and the elements shall be melted with heat , and the earth and the works which are in it , shall be burnt up .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved , what manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness ?
DRA	2%20Peter	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord , by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with the burning heat ?
DRA	2%20Peter	3	13	But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises , in which justice dwelleth .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	14	Wherefore , dearly beloved , waiting for these things , be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	15	And account the longsuffering of our Lord , salvation ; as also our most dear brother Paul , according to the wisdom given him , hath written to you :
DRA	2%20Peter	3	16	As also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are certain things hard to be understood , which the unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , to their own destruction .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	17	You therefore , brethren , knowing these things before , take heed , lest being led aside by the error of the unwise , you fall from your own steadfastness .
DRA	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	1%20John	1	4	And these things we write to you , that you may rejoice , and your joy may be full .
DRA	1%20John	1	5	And this is the declaration which we have heard from him , and declare unto you : That God is light , and in him there is no darkness .
DRA	1%20John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth .
DRA	1%20John	1	7	But if we walk in the light , as he also is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
DRA	1%20John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .

DRA	1%20John	2	1899	American Edition
DRA	1%20John	2	3	And by this we know that we have known him , if we keep his commandments .
DRA	1%20John	2	4	He who saith that he knoweth him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
DRA	1%20John	2	5	But he that keepeth his word , in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected ; and by this we know that we are in him .
DRA	1%20John	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him , ought himself also to walk , even as he walked .
DRA	1%20John	2	7	Dearly beloved , I write not a new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which you have heard .
DRA	1%20John	2	8	Again a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true both in him and in you ; because the darkness is passed , and the true light now shineth .
DRA	1%20John	2	9	He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
DRA	1%20John	2	10	He that loveth his brother , abideth in the light , and there is no scandal in him .
DRA	1%20John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother , is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth ; because the darkness hath blinded his eyes .
DRA	1%20John	2	12	I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
DRA	1%20John	2	13	I write unto you , fathers , because you have known him , who is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because you have overcome the wicked one .
DRA	1%20John	2	14	I write unto you , babes , because you have known the Father . I write unto you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and you have overcome the wicked one .
DRA	1%20John	2	15	Love not the world , nor the things which are in the world . If any man love the world , the charity of the Father is not in him .
DRA	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world , is the concupiscence of the flesh , and the concupiscence of the eyes , and the pride of life , which is not of the Father , but is of the world .
DRA	1%20John	2	17	And the world passeth away , and the concupiscence thereof : but he that doth the will of God , abideth for ever .
DRA	1%20John	2	18	Little children , it is the last hour ; and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh , even now there are become many Antichrists : whereby we know that it is the last hour .
DRA	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they were not of us . For if they had been of us , they would no doubt have remained with us ; but that they may be manifest , that they are not all of us .
DRA	1%20John	2	20	But you have the unction from the Holy One , and know all things .
DRA	1%20John	2	21	I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth , but as to them that know it : and that no lie is of the truth .
DRA	1%20John	2	22	Who is a liar , but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? This is Antichrist , who denieth the Father , and the Son .
DRA	1%20John	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father . He that confesseth the Son , hath the Father also .
DRA	1%20John	2	24	As for you , let that which you have heard from the beginning , abide in you . If that abide in you , which you have heard from the beginning , you also shall abide in the Son , and in the Father .

DRA	1%20John	3	2	Dearly beloved , we are now the sons of God ; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be . We know , that , when he shall appear , we shall be like to him : because we shall see him as he is .
DRA	1%20John	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity ; and sin is iniquity .
DRA	1%20John	3	5	And you know that he appeared to take away our sins , and in him there is no sin .
DRA	1%20John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him , sinneth not ; and whosoever sinneth , hath not seen him , nor known him .
DRA	1%20John	3	7	Little children , let no man deceive you . He that doth justice is just , even as he is just .
DRA	1%20John	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil : for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose , the Son of God appeared , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
DRA	1%20John	3	9	Whosoever is born of God , committeth not sin : for his seed abideth in him , and he can not sin , because he is born of God .
DRA	1%20John	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil . Whosoever is not just , is not of God , nor he that loveth not his brother .
DRA	1%20John	3	11	For this is the declaration , which you have heard from the beginning , that you should love one another .
DRA	1%20John	3	12	Not as Cain , who was of the wicked one , and killed his brother . And wherefore did he kill him ? Because his own works were wicked : and his brother 's just .
DRA	1%20John	3	13	Wonder not , brethren , if the world hate you .
DRA	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed from death to life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not , abideth in death .
DRA	1%20John	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer . And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself .
DRA	1%20John	3	16	In this we have known the charity of God , because he hath laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
DRA	1%20John	3	17	He that hath the substance of this world , and shall see his brother in need , and shall shut up his bowels from him : how doth the charity of God abide in him ?
DRA	1%20John	3	18	My little children , let us not love in word , nor in tongue , but in deed , and in truth .
DRA	1%20John	3	19	In this we know that we are of the truth : and in his sight shall persuade our hearts .
DRA	1%20John	3	20	For if our heart reprehend us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
DRA	1%20John	3	21	Dearly beloved , if our heart do not reprehend us , we have confidence towards God :
DRA	1%20John	3	22	And whatsoever we shall ask , we shall receive of him : because we keep his commandments , and do those things which are pleasing in his sight .
DRA	1%20John	3	23	And this is his commandment , that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ : and love one another , as he hath given commandment unto us .

DRA	1%20John	4	2	By this is the spirit of God known . Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh , is of God :
DRA	1%20John	4	3	And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus , is not of God : and this is Antichrist , of whom you have heard that he cometh , and he is now already in the world .
DRA	1%20John	4	5	They are of the world : therefore of the world they speak , and the world heareth them .
DRA	1%20John	4	6	We are of God . He that knoweth God , heareth us . He that is not of God , heareth us not . By this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
DRA	1%20John	4	7	Dearly beloved , let us love one another , for charity is of God . And every one that loveth , is born of God , and knoweth God .
DRA	1%20John	4	8	He that loveth not , knoweth not God : for God is charity .
DRA	1%20John	4	9	By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us , because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we may live by him .
DRA	1%20John	4	10	In this is charity : not as though we had loved God , but because he hath first loved us , and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins .
DRA	1%20John	4	11	My dearest , if God hath so loved us ; we also ought to love one another .
DRA	1%20John	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God abideth in us , and his charity is perfected in us .
DRA	1%20John	4	13	In this we know that we abide in him , and he in us : because he hath given us of his spirit .
DRA	1%20John	4	14	And we have seen , and do testify , that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world .
DRA	1%20John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God abideth in him , and he in God .

DRA	1%20John	4	18	Fear is not in charity : but perfect charity casteth out fear , because fear hath pain . And he that feareth , is not perfected in charity .
DRA	1%20John	4	19	Let us therefore love God , because God first hath loved us .
DRA	1%20John	4	20	If any man say , I love God , and hateth his brother ; he is a liar . For he that loveth not his brother , whom he seeth , how can he love God , whom he seeth not ?

DRA	1%20John	5	2	In this we know that we love the children of God : when we love God , and keep his commandments .
DRA	1%20John	5	3	For this is the charity of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not heavy .
DRA	1%20John	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God , overcometh the world : and this is the victory which overcometh the world , our faith .
DRA	1%20John	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood , Jesus Christ : not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit which testifieth , that Christ is the truth .
DRA	1%20John	5	7	And there are three who give testimony in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost . And these three are one .
DRA	1%20John	5	8	And there are three that give testimony on earth : the spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three are one .
DRA	1%20John	5	9	If we receive the testimony of men , the testimony of God is greater . For this is the testimony of God , which is greater , because he hath testified of his Son .
DRA	1%20John	5	10	He that believeth in the Son of God , hath the testimony of God in himself . He that believeth not the Son , maketh him a liar : because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son .
DRA	1%20John	5	11	And this is the testimony , that God hath given to us eternal life . And this life is in his Son .
DRA	1%20John	5	12	He that hath the Son , hath life . He that hath not the Son , hath not life .
DRA	1%20John	5	13	These things I write to you , that you may know that you have eternal life , you who believe in the name of the Son of God .

DRA	1%20John	5	16	He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death , let him ask , and life shall be given to him , who sinneth not to death . There is a sin unto death : for that I say not that any man ask .
DRA	1%20John	5	17	All iniquity is sin . And there is a sin unto death .
DRA	1%20John	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God , sinneth not : but the generation of God preserveth him , and the wicked one toucheth him not .

DRA	2%20John	1	6	And this is charity , that we walk according to his commandments . For this is the commandment , that , as you have heard from the beginning , you should walk in the same :
DRA	2%20John	1	7	For many seducers are gone out into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh : this is a seducer and an antichrist .
DRA	2%20John	1	8	Look to yourselves , that you lose not the things which you have wrought : but that you may receive a full reward .

DRA	3%20John	1	6	Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church : whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God .
DRA	3%20John	1	7	Because , for his name they went out , taking nothing of the Gentiles .
DRA	3%20John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such , that we may be fellow helpers of the truth .
DRA	3%20John	1	9	I had written perhaps to the church : but Diotrephes , who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them , doth not receive us .
DRA	3%20John	1	10	For this cause , if I come , I will advertise his works which he doth , with malicious words prating against us . And as if these things were not enough for him , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and them that do receive them he forbiddeth , and casteth out of the church .

DRA	Jude	1	1899	American Edition
DRA	Jude	1	1	Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James : to them that are beloved in God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called .
DRA	Jude	1	2	Mercy unto you , and peace , and charity be fulfilled .
DRA	Jude	1	3	Dearly beloved , taking all care to write unto you concerning your common salvation , I was under a necessity to write unto you : to beseech you to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints .
DRA	Jude	1	4	For certain men are secretly entered in , ( who were written of long ago unto this judgment , ) ungodly men , turning the grace of our Lord God into riotousness , and denying the only sovereign Ruler , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
DRA	Jude	1	5	I will therefore admonish you , though ye once knew all things , that Jesus , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , did afterwards destroy them that believed not :
DRA	Jude	1	6	And the angels who kept not their principality , but forsook their own habitation , he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains , unto the judgment of the great day .
DRA	Jude	1	7	As Sodom and Gomorrha , and the neighbouring cities , in like manner , having given themselves to fornication , and going after other flesh , were made an example , suffering the punishment of eternal fire .
DRA	Jude	1	8	In like manner these men also defile the flesh , and despise dominion , and blaspheme majesty .
DRA	Jude	1	9	When Michael the archangel , disputing with the devil , contended about the body of Moses , he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech , but said : The Lord command thee .
DRA	Jude	1	10	But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not : and what things soever they naturally know , like dumb beasts , in these they are corrupted .
DRA	Jude	1	11	Woe unto them , for they have gone in the way of Cain : and after the error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves , and have perished in the contradiction of Core .
DRA	Jude	1	12	These are spots in their banquets , feasting together without fear , feeding themselves , clouds without water , which are carried about by winds , trees of the autumn , unfruitful , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ,
DRA	Jude	1	13	Raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own confusion ; wandering stars , to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever .
DRA	Jude	1	14	Now of these Enoch also , the seventh from Adam , prophesied , saying : Behold , the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints ,
DRA	Jude	1	15	To execute judgment upon all , and to reprove all the ungodly for all the works of their ungodliness , whereby they have done ungodly , and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God .
DRA	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers , full of complaints , walking according to their own desires , and their mouth speaketh proud things , admiring persons for gain 's sake .
DRA	Jude	1	17	But you , my dearly beloved , be mindful of the words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Jude	1	18	Who told you , that in the last time there should come mockers , walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses .
DRA	Jude	1	19	These are they , who separate themselves , sensual men , having not the Spirit .
DRA	Jude	1	20	But you , my beloved , building yourselves upon your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
DRA	Jude	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God , waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ , unto life everlasting .
DRA	Jude	1	22	And some indeed reprove , being judged :
DRA	Jude	1	23	But others save , pulling them out of the fire . And on others have mercy , in fear , hating also the spotted garment which is carnal .
DRA	Jude	1	24	Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin , and to present you spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy , in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
DRA	Jude	1	25	To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord , be glory and magnificence , empire and power , before all ages , and now , and for all ages of ages . Amen . Public Domain ( Why are modern Bible translations copyrighted ? )

DRA	Revelation	1	13	And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks , one like to the Son of man , clothed with a garment down to the feet , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
DRA	Revelation	1	14	And his head and his hairs were white , as white wool , and as snow , and his eyes were as a flame of fire ,
DRA	Revelation	1	15	And his feet like unto fine brass , as in a burning furnace . And his voice as the sound of many waters .
DRA	Revelation	1	16	And he had in his right hand seven stars . And from his mouth came out a sharp two edged sword : and his face was as the sun shineth in his power .
DRA	Revelation	1	17	And when I had seen him , I fell at his feet as dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying : Fear not . I am the First and the Last ,
DRA	Revelation	1	18	And alive , and was dead , and behold I am living for ever and ever , and have the keys of death and of hell .
DRA	Revelation	1	19	Write therefore the things which thou hast seen , and which are , and which must be done hereafter .
