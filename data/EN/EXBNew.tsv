EXB	Matthew	1	18	This is how the birth of Jesus ·Christ [ the Messiah ] came about . His mother Mary was ·engaged [ pledged ; T betrothed ; C a formal agreement between families that required a “ divorce ” to annul ] to marry Joseph , but before they ·married [ came to live together ] , she ·learned she was [ or was found/discovered to be ] ·pregnant [ T with child ] ·by the power of [ through ] the Holy Spirit .
EXB	Matthew	1	19	Because Mary ’ s husband , Joseph , was a ·good [ righteous ] man , he did not want to disgrace her in public , so he planned to ·divorce her [ end the engagement ] ·secretly [ privately ; quietly ] .

EXB	Matthew	1	23	“ [ L Look ; T Behold ] The virgin will ·be pregnant [ L conceive in her womb ; Is . 7:14 ] . She will ·have [ give birth to ] a son , and they will name him Immanuel , ” which [ C in Hebrew ] means “ God is with us. ”

EXB	Matthew	2	5	They answered , “ In the town of Bethlehem in Judea . ·The prophet wrote about this in the Scriptures [ L For so it has been written by the prophet ] :
EXB	Matthew	2	6	] was now ·king [ reigning ] in Judea ·since his father Herod had died [ L in place of his father Herod ] . So Joseph was afraid to go there . After being warned in a dream , he ·went [ withdrew ] to the ·area [ region ; district ] of Galilee ,
EXB	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod ·had a secret meeting with [ privately summoned ] the ·wise men [ astrologers ; magi ; v.
EXB	Matthew	2	1	] and ·learned [ inquired ] from them the exact time ·they first saw the star [ the star appeared ] .
EXB	Matthew	2	8	He sent the ·wise men [ astrologers ; magi ] to Bethlehem , saying , “ ·Look [ Go and search ] carefully for the child . When you find him , ·come tell [ report to ] me so I can [ L go and ] ·worship [ pay homage to ] him too. ”
EXB	Matthew	2	9	After the ·wise men [ astrologers ; magi ] ·heard [ listened to ; had their interview with ] the king , they ·left [ went on their way ; set out ] . [ L And look ] The star that they had seen ·in the east [ or when it rose ] went ·before [ ahead of ] them until it ·stopped [ stood ] above the place where the child was .
EXB	Matthew	2	10	When the ·wise men [ astologers ; magi ] saw the star , they ·were filled with joy [ were overjoyed ; L rejoiced with exceedingly great joy ] .
EXB	Matthew	2	11	They ·came to [ entered ] the house where the child was and saw him with his mother , Mary , and they ·bowed down [ knelt ; L fell ] and ·worshiped [ paid homage to ] him .

Stay there until I tell you to return , because Herod is ·starting [ intending ; going ] to ·look [ search ] for the child so he can kill him. ”
EXB	Matthew	2	14	So Joseph got up and left for Egypt during the night with the child and his mother .
EXB	Matthew	2	15	And Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died . This happened to ·bring about [ fulfill ] what the Lord had said through the prophet : “ I called my son out of Egypt [ Hos . 11:1 ; C Jesus fulfills the role of Israel by leading a spiritual Exodus ] . ” Herod Kills the Baby Boys
EXB	Matthew	2	16	When Herod saw that the ·wise men [ astologers ; magi ] had ·tricked [ outwitted ; outsmarted ] him , he was furious .

EXB	Matthew	2	21	So Joseph [ L got up , ] took the child and his mother and ·went [ returned ] to Israel .
EXB	Matthew	2	22	But he heard that Archelaus [ C reigned from
EXB	Matthew	2	23	to a town called Nazareth , and lived there . And so what ·God had said [ was spoken ; C the passive verb implies God as subject ] through the prophets ·came true [ was fulfilled ] : “ He will be called a Nazarene [ C a person from the town of Nazareth ; perhaps a reference to Is . 11:1 , where the Hebrew word translated “ branch ” sounds like “ Nazarene ” ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	3	3	·John the Baptist [ L For this ] is the one Isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said : “ This is a voice of one who ·calls out [ shouts ; cries out ] in the ·desert [ wilderness ] : ‘ Prepare the way for the Lord .

EXB	Matthew	3	6	They confessed their sins , and he baptized them in the Jordan River .
EXB	Matthew	3	7	Many of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the place where John was baptizing people . When John saw them , he said , “ You ·are snakes [ T brood/offspring of vipers ] ! Who warned you to ·run [ slither ; L flee ] away from God ’ s coming ·punishment [ wrath ; retribution ] ?
EXB	Matthew	3	8	·Do the things [ L Produce the fruit ] ·that show you really have changed your hearts and lives [ that prove your repentance ; L of repentance ] .
EXB	Matthew	3	9	And don ’ t ·think you can [ presume to ] say to yourselves , ‘ Abraham is our father [ C a claim to be God ’ s special people ] . ’ [ L For ] I tell you that God could ·make [ create ; L raise up ] children for Abraham from these rocks .

EXB	Matthew	3	16	As soon as Jesus was baptized , he came up out of the water . Then ·heaven [ the sky/heavens ] opened , and he saw God ’ s Spirit ·coming down [ descending and lighting/settling ] on him like a dove [ C either in the form of a dove , or in bird-like descent ] .
EXB	Matthew	3	17	And a voice from heaven said , “ This is my ·Son , whom I love [ dearly beloved Son ; Ps . 2:7 ; Gen. 22:2 ] , and I am ·very [ well ] pleased with him [ Is . 42:1 ] . ”

EXB	Matthew	4	3	The ·devil came to Jesus to tempt him [ L tempter/tester came to Jesus ] , saying , “ If you are the Son of God , ·tell [ command ] these rocks to ·become bread [ turn into loaves ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil ·led [ took ] Jesus to the holy city [ C Jerusalem ] and put him on ·a high place [ the highest point ; the pinnacle ] of the Temple .
EXB	Matthew	4	6	The devil said , “ If you are the Son of God , ·jump [ L throw yourself ] down , because it is written in the Scriptures : ‘ He ·has put his angels in charge of you [ or will order his angels to protect you ; L will command his angel concerning you ] . They will ·catch you in [ lift you up with ] their hands so that you will not hit your foot on a rock [ Ps . 91:11–12 ] . ’ ”
EXB	Matthew	4	7	Jesus answered him , “ It also says in the Scriptures , ‘ Do not test the Lord your God [ Deut . 6:16 ] . ’ ”
EXB	Matthew	4	8	·Then [ Again ] the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all their ·splendor [ glory ] .
EXB	Matthew	4	9	The devil said , “ If you will ·bow [ fall ] down and worship me , I will give you all these things. ”
EXB	Matthew	4	10	Jesus said to him , “ ·Go away from me [ Get out of here ; Be gone ] , Satan ! [ L For ] It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him [ Deut . 6:13 ] . ’ ”

EXB	Matthew	11	19	] , it would ·still be a city [ L have remained until ] today [ C because its people would have repented and judgment averted ] .
EXB	Matthew	11	20	Then Jesus began to ·criticize [ denounce ; reproach ] the cities where he did ·most [ so many ] of his ·miracles [ powerful deeds ] , because the people did not ·change their lives and stop sinning [ repent ] .

EXB	Matthew	12	5	And have you not read in the ·law of Moses [ L Law ] that on every Sabbath day the priests in the Temple ·break this law about [ violate ; desecrate ; profane ] the Sabbath day [ C by working when they offer sacrifices ] ? But the priests are ·not wrong for doing that [ L innocent ; not guilty ] .
EXB	Matthew	12	6	I tell you that there is ·something [ or someone ; C may refer to Jesus himself or to the arrival of the kingdom ] here that is greater than the Temple .

EXB	Matthew	12	15	Jesus knew ·what the Pharisees were doing [ L this ] , so he left that place . ·Many people [ Large crowds ] followed him , and he healed all who were sick .
EXB	Matthew	12	16	But Jesus warned the people not to ·tell who he was [ make him known ] .

EXB	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the Pharisees and ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] answered Jesus , saying , “ Teacher , we want to see ·you work a miracle as a sign [ L a sign from you ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	12	39	Jesus answered , “ Evil and sinful people [ L An evil and adulterous/unfaithful generation ] are the ones who ·want to see [ seek after ; ask for ; demand ] ·a miracle for a sign [ L a sign ] . But no sign will be given to them , except the sign of the prophet Jonah .

EXB	Matthew	13	2	Large crowds gathered around him , so he got into a boat and sat down , while the people stood on the shore .
EXB	Matthew	13	3	Then Jesus used ·stories [ parables ] to teach them many things . He said : “ A ·farmer [ sower ] went out to ·plant [ sow ] his seed .

EXB	Matthew	13	7	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds , which grew and choked the good plants .
EXB	Matthew	13	8	Some other seed fell on good ground where it grew and produced ·a crop [ grain ] . Some plants made a hundred times more , some made sixty times more , and some made thirty times more .

EXB	Matthew	13	10	The ·followers [ disciples ] came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do you ·use stories to teach the people [ L speak to them in parables ] ? ”

EXB	Matthew	13	12	Those who ·have understanding [ L have ] will be given more , and they will have ·all they need [ an abundance ] . But those who do not ·have understanding [ L have ] , even what they have will be taken away from them .

EXB	Matthew	13	18	“ So listen to the ·meaning of that story about the farmer [ parable of the sower ] .
EXB	Matthew	13	19	What is the seed that fell ·by the road [ along the path ] ? That seed is like ·the person [ anyone ] who hears the ·message [ word ; teaching ] about the kingdom but does not understand it .

EXB	Matthew	17	3	Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with Jesus . [ C God had given the Law through Moses , and Elijah was an important prophet ( see Mark 6:15 ) ; together they signify that Jesus fulfills the OT . ]
EXB	Matthew	17	4	Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good that we are here . If you want , I will put up three ·tents [ shelters ; shrines ; tabernacles ; Lev . 23:42 ] here—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ” [ C Perhaps Peter wanted to prolong their stay or to commemorate their visit . ]
EXB	Matthew	17	5	While Peter was talking , [ L look ; T behold ] a bright cloud ·covered [ overshadowed ; Ex . 24:15 ] them .

EXB	Matthew	17	10	Then his ·followers [ disciples ] asked him , “ Why do the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] say that Elijah must come first [ C that is , before the Messiah comes ; Mal . 3:1 ; 4:5 ] ? ”
EXB	Matthew	17	11	Jesus answered , “ ·They are right to say that Elijah is coming and that [ L Elijah is indeed coming , and ] he will ·make everything the way it should be [ restore/prepare everything ] .
EXB	Matthew	17	12	But I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him . They did to him whatever they wanted to do . It will be the same with the Son of Man ; those same people will make the Son of Man suffer. ”

EXB	Matthew	17	19	The ·followers [ disciples ] came to Jesus when he was alone and asked , “ Why couldn ’ t we ·force [ drive ; cast ] the demon out ? ”
EXB	Matthew	17	20	Jesus answered , “ Because ·your faith is too small [ you have so little faith ] . I tell you the truth , if your faith is ·as big as [ as small as ; the size of ; L as ; like ] a mustard seed , you can say to this mountain , ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move . ·All things will be possible [ L Nothing would be impossible ] for you . |21 That kind of spirit comes out only if you use prayer and fasting.| ” [ a ] Jesus Talks About His Death ( C )

EXB	Matthew	17	25	Peter answered , “ Yes. ” Peter went into the house , but before he could speak , Jesus said to him , “ What do you think ? From whom do the kings of the earth collect ·different kinds of taxes [ tribute/tolls or taxes ] —the king ’ s ·children [ or own people/citizens ] or ·others [ or foreigners ; C perhaps tribute paid by defeated nations ] ? ”
EXB	Matthew	17	26	Peter answered , “ ·Other people pay the taxes [ L From others ] . ” Jesus said to Peter , “ Then the ·children [ or people ; citizens ] of the king ·don ’ t have to pay taxes [ are exempt/free ] .

EXB	Matthew	18	2	Jesus called a little child to him and stood the child before his ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	Matthew	18	3	Then he said , “ I tell you the truth , you must ·change [ or turn from your sins ; convert ; L turn ] and become like little children . Otherwise , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
EXB	Matthew	18	4	The greatest person in the kingdom of heaven [ L therefore ] is the one who makes himself humble [ and becomes ] like this [ little ] child .
EXB	Matthew	18	5	“ [ L And ] Whoever ·accepts [ welcomes ; receives ] a child ·in my name [ C as a representative or follower of Jesus ] ·accepts [ welcomes ; receives ] me [ C indicates concern for the lowly ; children had low social status ] .

EXB	Matthew	18	8	If your hand or your foot causes you to ·sin [ lose faith ; stumble ] , cut it off and throw it away .

EXB	Matthew	18	13	I tell you the truth , if he finds it he ·is happier about [ rejoices more over ] that one sheep than ·about [ over ] the ninety-nine that ·were never lost [ never went astray/wandered off ] .

EXB	Matthew	18	23	“ [ L Therefore ; For this reason ] The kingdom of heaven is like a king who decided to ·collect the money his servants owed him [ L settle accounts with his servants/slaves ] .

EXB	Matthew	18	26	“ But the ·servant [ slave ] fell ·on his knees [ face down ; in obeisance ] and begged , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you everything I owe. ’

EXB	Matthew	19	2	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
EXB	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came to Jesus ·and tried to trick [ to trap/test ] him . They asked , “ Is it ·right [ lawful ; C according to the law of Moses ] for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses ? ”
EXB	Matthew	19	4	Jesus answered , “ ·Surely you have [ L Haven ’ t you… ? ] read in the Scriptures : ·When God made the world , ‘ he [ L From the beginning , the Creator ] made them male and female ’ [ Gen. 1:27 ; 5:2 ] .
EXB	Matthew	19	5	And God said , ‘ So a man will leave his father and mother and be ·united with [ joined to ] his wife , and the two will become ·one body [ as though they were one person ; T one flesh ; Gen. 2:24 ] . ’
EXB	Matthew	19	6	So they are no longer two , but one . God has joined the two together , so no one should separate them. ”
EXB	Matthew	19	7	The Pharisees asked , “ Why then did Moses give a command for a man to divorce his wife by giving her ·divorce papers [ a certificate of divorce/dismissal ; Deut . 24:1 ] ? ”
EXB	Matthew	19	8	Jesus answered , “ Moses ·allowed [ permitted ] you to divorce your wives because ·you refused to accept God ’ s teaching [ L of your hard-heartedness ] , but ·divorce was not allowed in the beginning [ or this was not God ’ s intention at creation ; L from the beginning it was not like this ] .
EXB	Matthew	19	9	I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman ·is guilty of [ commits ] adultery . [ a ] ·The only reason for a man to divorce his wife is if his wife has sexual relations with another man [ L …except in the case of sexual immorality ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	19	10	The ·followers [ disciples ] said to him , “ If that is the ·only reason a man can divorce his wife [ situation/case between a husband and wife ] , it is better not to marry. ”
EXB	Matthew	19	11	Jesus answered , “ Not everyone can accept this ·teaching [ word ] , but ·God has made some able to accept it [ or only those given this gift of celibacy ; L only to those whom it has been given ] .

EXB	Matthew	21	38	But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . Let ’ s kill him , and we will get his inheritance ! ’
EXB	Matthew	21	39	Then the farmers grabbed the son , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .

EXB	Matthew	21	41	·The priests and leaders [ L They ] said , “ He will ·surely kill those evil men [ bring those wretches/evil men to a wretched/evil end ] .

You are not ·afraid of [ L concerned about ] what other people think about you , because you ·pay no attention to who they are [ play no favorites ; are impartial ; aren ’ t swayed by appearances ] .
EXB	Matthew	22	17	So tell us what you think . Is it ·right [ permissible ; lawful ] to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ” [ C Saying “ yes ” would anger Jews who hated Roman rule ; saying “ no ” could result in being charged with insurrection . ]

EXB	Matthew	22	19	Show me a coin used for paying the tax. ” So the men ·showed him a coin [ L brought him a denarius ; C a Roman coin worth a day ’ s wages ] .

EXB	Matthew	22	23	That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question . ( Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead . )

EXB	Matthew	22	37	Jesus answered , “ ‘ Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , and all your mind [ Deut . 6:5 ] . ’
EXB	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and ·most important [ greatest ] command .

EXB	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus ·said nothing [ was silent ; Is . 53:7 ] . Again the high priest said to Jesus , “ I ·command you by the power of [ demand in the name of ; put you under oath by ] the living God : Tell us if you are the ·Christ [ Messiah ] , the Son of God. ”
EXB	Matthew	26	64	Jesus answered , “ ·Those are your words [ L You have said it/so ; C an indirect affirmation ] . But I tell you , ·in the future [ L from now on ] you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God , the ·Powerful One [ or the place of power ; L power ] , and coming on ·clouds in the sky [ the clouds of heaven ; Ps . 110:1 ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	26	65	When the high priest heard this , he tore his clothes [ C a sign of sorrow or outrage ] and said , “ This man has ·said things that are against God [ blasphemed ] ! ·We don ’ t [ Why should we… ? ] need any more witnesses ; you all heard ·him say these things against God [ the blasphemy ] .
EXB	Matthew	26	66	What ·do you think [ is your verdict ] ? ” The people answered , “ He ·should [ deserves to ; is guilty and should ] die. ”
EXB	Matthew	26	67	Then the people there spat in Jesus ’ face and beat him with their fists . Others slapped him .
EXB	Matthew	26	68	They said , “ ·Prove to us that you are a prophet [ L Prophesy to/for us ] , you ·Christ [ Messiah ] ! Tell us who hit you ! ” Peter Says He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus ( J )
EXB	Matthew	26	69	At that time , as Peter was sitting [ L outside ] in the courtyard , a servant girl came to him and said , “ You also were with Jesus of Galilee. ”
EXB	Matthew	26	70	But Peter denied it in front of everyone . He said , “ I don ’ t know what you are talking about. ”
EXB	Matthew	26	71	When he left the courtyard and was at the gate , another girl saw him . She said to the people there , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
EXB	Matthew	26	72	Again , ·Peter said he was never with him , saying , “ I swear [ L he denied it with an oath , saying , ] I don ’ t know this man Jesus ! ”
EXB	Matthew	26	73	A short time later , some people standing there went to Peter and said , “ Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus . The way you talk shows it [ C Peter ’ s Galilean accent gave him away ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	26	74	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear , “ I don ’ t know the man. ” At once , a rooster crowed .
EXB	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered what Jesus had told him : “ Before the rooster crows , you will ·say three times that you don ’ t know me [ deny/disown me three times ] . ” Then Peter went outside and ·cried painfully [ T wept bitterly ] .

EXB	Matthew	27	3	Judas , the one who had ·given [ betrayed ] Jesus to his enemies , saw that ·they had decided to kill Jesus [ Jesus had been condemned ] . Then he was ·very sorry [ filled with remorse ] for what he had done . So he took the thirty silver coins back to the leading [ T chief ] priests and the elders ,
EXB	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I sinned ; I ·handed over to you [ betrayed ] ·an innocent man [ L innocent blood ] . ” The leaders answered , “ What ·is that to us [ do we care ] ? That ’ s your ·problem , not ours [ responsibility ; concern ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	27	5	So Judas threw the ·money [ silver coins ] into the ·Temple [ sanctuary ] . Then he went off and hanged himself .
EXB	Matthew	27	6	The ·leading [ T chief ] priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple and said , “ ·Our law does not allow us [ or It is not right ] to ·keep [ put ] this money ·with the Temple money [ in the Temple treasury ] , because it ·has paid for a man ’ s death [ is blood money ; L is the price of blood ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	27	7	So they decided to use the coins to buy ·Potter ’ s Field [ or the potter ’ s field ] as a place to bury ·strangers [ or foreigners ] .
EXB	Matthew	27	8	That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood .
EXB	Matthew	27	9	So what Jeremiah the prophet had said ·came true [ was fulfilled ] : “ They took thirty ·silver coins [ T pieces of silver ] . That is ·how little the Israelites thought he was worth [ or the price at which he was valued by the Israelites ; or the value of a man with a price on his head among the Israelites ; Jer . 18:2–3 ; 19:1–13 ; 32:5–15 ; Zech . 11:12–13 ] .

EXB	Matthew	27	12	When the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the elders accused Jesus , he ·said nothing [ did not answer ] .
EXB	Matthew	27	13	So Pilate said to Jesus , “ Don ’ t you hear them accusing you of ·all these [ so many ] things ? ”
EXB	Matthew	27	14	But Jesus ·said nothing in answer to Pilate [ did not answer a single charge ] , and ·Pilate [ L the governor ] was very ·surprised [ amazed ] at this . Pilate Tries to Free Jesus ( C )

EXB	Matthew	27	17	When the people gathered , Pilate said , “ Whom do you want me to set free : Barabbas [ b ] or Jesus who is called the ·Christ [ Messiah ] ? ”
EXB	Matthew	27	18	[ L For ] Pilate knew that they turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous .
EXB	Matthew	27	19	While Pilate was sitting there on the judge ’ s seat [ C a special seat for speeches or judicial pronouncements ] , his wife sent this message to him : “ ·Don ’ t do anything to [ or Have nothing to do with ] that man , because he is ·innocent [ righteous ] . Today I had a dream about him , and it ·troubled me very much [ caused me great pain/anguish ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	27	20	But the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and elders convinced the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and for Jesus to be ·killed [ executed ] .
EXB	Matthew	27	21	Pilate said , “ Which of these two do you want me to set free for you ? ” The people answered , “ Barabbas. ”
EXB	Matthew	27	22	Pilate asked , “ So what should I do with Jesus , the one called the ·Christ [ Messiah ] ? ” They all answered , “ Crucify him ! ”
EXB	Matthew	27	23	Pilate asked , “ Why ? What ·wrong [ crime ; evil ] has he done ? ” But they shouted louder , “ Crucify him ! ”
EXB	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he ·could do nothing about this [ was getting nowhere ; was gaining nothing ] and that a riot was starting , he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd . Then he said , “ I am ·not guilty [ innocent ] of this man ’ s ·death [ L blood ] . ·You are the ones who are causing it [ It is your responsibility now ; or Take care of it yourselves ] ! ”
EXB	Matthew	27	25	All the people answered , “ ·We and our children will be responsible for his death [ L His blood be on us and on our children ] . ”
EXB	Matthew	27	26	Then he set Barabbas free . But he had Jesus ·beaten with whips [ scourged ; flogged ] and handed over to the soldiers to be crucified .

EXB	Matthew	27	30	They spat on Jesus . Then they took his ·stick [ reed ; staff ] and began to beat him on the head .
EXB	Matthew	27	31	After they ·finished [ had mocked him ] , the soldiers took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again . Then they led him away to be crucified . Jesus Is Crucified ( D )

EXB	Matthew	27	35	When the soldiers had crucified him , they threw lots [ C similar to dice ] to ·decide who would get [ L divide up ] his clothes [ c ] [ Ps . 22:18 ] .

EXB	Matthew	27	41	The ·leading [ T chief ] priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish elders were also ·making fun of [ mocking ] Jesus .
EXB	Matthew	27	42	They said , “ He saved others , but he can ’ t save himself ! He says he is the king of Israel ! If he is the king , let him come down now from the cross . Then we will believe in him .

EXB	Matthew	27	47	Some of the people standing there who heard this said , “ He is calling Elijah. ” [ C The prophet Elijah , associated with the end times ( Mal . 4:5 ) , was also viewed as a helper in time of need . ]
EXB	Matthew	27	48	·Quickly [ At once ] one of them ran and got a sponge and filled it with ·vinegar [ or sour wine ; C an inexpensive drink used by soldiers and slaves ] and tied it to a ·stick [ reed ] and gave it to Jesus to drink [ Ps . 69:21 ] .
EXB	Matthew	27	49	But the others said , “ ·Don ’ t bother him [ Wait ; Leave him alone ] . We want to see if Elijah will come to save him. ”

EXB	Mark	2	6	Some of the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] were sitting there , thinking to themselves ,
EXB	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man ·say things like that [ speak this way ] ? He is ·speaking as if he were God [ L blaspheming ] . ·Only God can forgive sins. ” [ L “ Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ” ; cf . Is . 43:25 ] .
EXB	Mark	2	8	Jesus knew immediately [ in his spirit ] what these teachers of the law were thinking . So he said to them , “ Why are you thinking these things [ L in your hearts ] ?
EXB	Mark	2	9	Which is easier : to tell this paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to tell him , ‘ Stand up . Take your ·mat [ cot ] and walk ’ ?
EXB	Mark	2	10	But ·I will prove to you [ L so that you may know ] that the Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] has authority on earth to forgive sins. ” So Jesus said to the paralyzed man ,
EXB	Mark	2	11	“ I tell you , stand up , take your ·mat [ cot ] , and go home. ”
EXB	Mark	2	12	Immediately the paralyzed man stood up , took his ·mat [ cot ] , and walked out while everyone was watching him . The people were [ all ] amazed and praised God . They said , “ We have never seen anything like this ! ” Jesus Calls Levi to Follow Him ( B )
EXB	Mark	2	13	Jesus went to the lake again . The whole crowd ·followed him [ came to him ] there , and he taught them .
EXB	Mark	2	14	While he was walking along , he saw a man named Levi son of Alphaeus sitting in the tax collector ’ s booth [ C probably a tariff booth for taxing goods in transit ] . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he stood up and followed Jesus .
EXB	Mark	2	15	Later , as Jesus was ·having dinner [ L reclining ; C around a low table , the posture for a formal banquet or dinner party ] at Levi ’ s house , many tax collectors and sinners were eating there with Jesus and his followers . Many people like this followed Jesus .
EXB	Mark	2	16	When the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with the tax collectors and sinners , they asked his followers , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ” [ C Tax collectors were despised because they worked for the Roman rulers and were notorious for corruption and extortion . ]
EXB	Mark	2	17	Jesus heard this and said to them , “ It is not the healthy people who need a doctor , but the sick . I did not come to ·invite [ call ] ·good people [ the righteous ; C meaning the “ self-righteous ” who feel no need to repent ] but to ·invite [ call ] sinners [ C those who recognize their need to repent ] . ” Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting ( C )
EXB	Mark	2	18	Now the ·followers [ disciples ] of John [ C the Baptist ; 1:4–8 ] and the Pharisees often fasted [ C giving up eating for spiritual purposes ] . ·Some people [ L They ] came to Jesus and said , “ Why do John ’ s ·followers [ disciples ] and the ·followers [ disciples ] of the Pharisees often fast , but your ·followers [ disciples ] don ’ t ? ”
EXB	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered , “ The ·friends of the bridegroom [ or wedding guests ; L children of the wedding hall ] do not fast while the bridegroom is still with them [ C Jesus is referring to himself ; John 3:29 ; Rev . 19:7 ] . As long as the bridegroom is with them , they can not fast .
EXB	Mark	2	20	But the ·time [ L days ] will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them , and ·then [ in that day ] they will fast .
EXB	Mark	2	21	“ No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth over a hole in an old ·coat [ garment ] . Otherwise , the patch will shrink and pull away—the new patch will pull away from the old ·coat [ garment ] . Then the ·hole [ tear ] will be worse .
EXB	Mark	2	22	Also , no one ever pours new wine into old ·leather bags [ wineskins ] . Otherwise , the new wine will break the ·bags [ skins ; C as the wine ferments and expands ] , and the wine will be ·ruined [ lost ] along with the ·bags [ skins ] . But new wine should be put into new ·leather bags [ wineskins ] . ” Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath ( D )
EXB	Mark	2	23	One Sabbath day , as Jesus was walking through some fields of grain , his ·followers [ disciples ] began to [ make a path and ] pick some grain to eat [ Deut . 23:25 ] .
EXB	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to Jesus , “ Why are your followers doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? ” [ C Gleaning was viewed as work , and therefore forbidden on the Sabbath ; Ex . 34:21 . ]
EXB	Mark	2	25	Jesus answered , “ Have you never read what David did when he and ·those with him [ his companions ] were hungry and needed food [
EXB	Mark	2	1	Sam . 21:1–6 ] ?
EXB	Mark	2	26	·During the time of Abiathar [ or , In the account about Abiathar ] the high priest , David went into God ’ s house and ate the ·holy bread [ consecrated bread ; L bread of presentation ] , which is lawful only for priests to eat [ Ex . 25:30 ; Lev . 24:5–9 ] . And David also gave some of the bread to those who were with him. ”
EXB	Mark	2	27	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees , “ The Sabbath day was made ·to help people [ T for man ] ; ·they were not made to be ruled by [ T not man for ] the Sabbath day .
EXB	Mark	2	28	So then , the Son of Man is ·Lord [ Master ] even of the Sabbath day . ”
EXB	Mark	3	3	Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand , “ Stand up here in ·the middle [ front ] of everyone. ”
EXB	Mark	3	2	·Some people [ L They ; C probably the Pharisees ; see 2:24 ,
EXB	Mark	3	27	No one can enter a strong man ’ s house and ·steal [ seize ; plunder ] his things unless he first ·ties up [ binds ] the strong man [ Is . 49:24–25 ] . Then he can ·steal [ seize ; plunder ] things from the house . [ C Satan is the strong man and his possessions are the people Jesus is freeing from Satan ’ s power . ]
EXB	Mark	3	4	Then Jesus asked ·the people [ L them ; C probably the Pharisees ] , “ Which is lawful [ C according to the law of Moses ] on the Sabbath day : to do good or to do evil , to save a life or to kill ? ” But they ·said nothing to answer him [ remained silent ] .
EXB	Mark	3	5	Jesus was angry as he looked at them , and he felt very ·sad [ distressed ; grieved ] because ·they were stubborn [ of their hard hearts ] . Then he said to the man , “ ·Hold out [ stretch out ] your hand. ” The man ·held out [ stretched out ] his hand and it was ·healed [ restored ] .
EXB	Mark	3	6	Then the Pharisees left and [ immediately ] began ·making plans [ plotting ] with the Herodians [ C a political group that supported king Herod and his family ] about a way to ·kill [ destroy ] Jesus . Many People Follow Jesus ( B )
EXB	Mark	3	7	Jesus left with his ·followers [ disciples ] for the lake , and a large crowd from Galilee followed him .
EXB	Mark	3	8	Also many people came from Judea , from Jerusalem , from Idumea [ C located to the south ] , from the lands across the Jordan River , and from the area of Tyre and Sidon [ C located to the north ] . When they heard what Jesus was doing , many people came to him .
EXB	Mark	3	9	When Jesus saw the crowds , he told his ·followers [ disciples ] to get a boat ready for him to keep people from ·crowding against [ crushing ] him .
EXB	Mark	3	10	He had healed many people , so all the sick were pushing toward him to touch him .
EXB	Mark	3	11	When ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ; see 1:23 ] spirits [ within people ] saw Jesus , they fell down before him and shouted , “ You are the Son of God ! ”

EXB	Mark	3	13	Then Jesus went up ·on a mountain [ to the hills ] and called to him those he wanted , and they came to him .

EXB	Mark	3	15	and to have the authority to ·force [ drive ; cast ] demons out of people .
EXB	Mark	3	16	These are the twelve he ·chose [ appointed ] : Simon ( Jesus named him Peter ) ,
EXB	Mark	3	17	James and John , the sons of Zebedee ( Jesus named them Boanerges , which [ C in Aramaic ] means “ Sons of Thunder ” ) ,
EXB	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot [ C either religiously zealous , or a ( former ) member of the revolutionary movement known as Zealots ] ,
EXB	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot [ C Iscariot probably means “ man of Kerioth ” ] , who later ·turned against [ betrayed ] Jesus . Some People Say Jesus Is Possessed by an Evil Spirit ( D )
EXB	Mark	3	20	Then Jesus went ·home [ into a house ] , but again a crowd gathered . There were so many people that Jesus and his followers could not eat .
EXB	Mark	3	21	When his ·family [ own people ] heard this , they went to ·get [ seize ; take charge of ] him because they thought he was out of his mind .
EXB	Mark	3	22	But the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] from Jerusalem were saying , “ ·Beelzebul [ C another name for Satan ] is ·living inside [ possessing ] him ! He uses power from the ·ruler [ prince ] of demons to ·force [ drive ; cast ] demons out of people. ”
EXB	Mark	3	23	So Jesus called the people together and ·taught them with stories [ L spoke to them in parables ; C Greek parabolē , which can mean stories and analogies of various kinds ] . He said , · “ Satan will not force himself out of people . [ L “ How can Satan drive out Satan ? ]
EXB	Mark	3	24	A kingdom that is ·divided [ at war with itself ] can not ·continue [ stand ] ,
EXB	Mark	3	25	and a ·family [ household ; L house ] that is divided can not ·continue [ stand ] .
EXB	Mark	3	26	And if Satan ·is [ rises ; rebels ] against himself and ·fights against his own people [ is divided ] , he can not ·continue [ stand ] ; that is the end of Satan .
EXB	Mark	3	28	I tell you the truth , all sins that people do and all ·the things people say against God [ blasphemies ] can be forgiven .
EXB	Mark	3	29	But anyone who ·speaks against [ blasphemes ] the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven ; he is guilty of ·a sin that continues forever [ a sin with eternal consequences ; L an eternal sin ] . ”
EXB	Mark	3	30	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law said that he had an ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ] spirit inside him . Jesus ’ True Family ( E )
EXB	Mark	3	31	Then Jesus ’ mother and ·brothers [ or brothers and sisters ; C the Greek word can mean “ siblings ” ; cf . 6:3 ] arrived . Standing outside , they sent someone in to tell him to come out .
EXB	Mark	3	32	Many people were sitting around Jesus , and they said to him , “ Your mother and brothers [ b ] are ·waiting [ looking ; asking ] for you outside. ”
EXB	Mark	3	33	Jesus asked , “ Who are my mother and my brothers [ and sisters ] ? ”
EXB	Mark	3	34	Then he looked at those sitting around him and said , “ ·Here are [ Look ; T Behold , ] my mother and my brothers [ and sisters ] !
EXB	Mark	3	35	My true brother and sister and mother are those who do ·what God wants [ the will of God ] . ”
EXB	Mark	4	4	While he was ·planting [ sowing ] , some seed fell ·by the road [ along the path ] , and the birds came and ate it up .
EXB	Mark	4	2	Jesus taught them many things , using ·stories [ parables ; see 3:23 ] . He said ,
EXB	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! A ·farmer [ sower ] went out to ·plant [ sow ] his seed .
EXB	Mark	4	5	Some seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn ’ t much dirt . That seed ·grew [ sprang up ] very fast , because the ground was not deep .
EXB	Mark	4	6	But when the sun rose , the plants ·dried up [ were scorched and withered ] because they did not have deep roots .
EXB	Mark	4	7	Some other seed fell among thorny weeds , which grew and choked the good plants . So those plants did not produce ·a crop [ grain ] .
EXB	Mark	4	8	Some other seed fell on good ground and began to grow . It got taller and produced ·a crop [ grain ] . Some plants made thirty times more , some made sixty times more , and some made a hundred times more. ”

Is . 43:8 ; Jer . 5:21 ; Ezek . 12:2 ] . ’ ” Jesus Explains the Seed Story ( C )
EXB	Mark	4	13	Then Jesus said to ·his followers [ L them ] , “ Don ’ t you understand this ·story [ parable ] ? If you don ’ t , how will you understand any ·story [ parable ; see 3:23 ] ?
EXB	Mark	4	14	·The farmer plants God ’ s message in people [ L The sower sows the word ] .
EXB	Mark	4	15	Sometimes the ·teaching [ word ; message ] falls ·on the road [ along the path ] . This is like the people who hear the ·teaching of God [ word ; message ] , but Satan quickly comes and takes away the ·teaching [ word ; message ] that was ·planted [ sown ] in them .
EXB	Mark	4	16	Others are like the seed ·planted [ sown ] on rocky ground . They hear the ·teaching [ word ; message ] and quickly accept it with joy .
EXB	Mark	4	17	·But since they don ’ t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives [ L But since they have no root in themselves ] , they keep it only a short time . When trouble or persecution comes because of the ·teaching they accepted [ word ; message ] , they quickly ·give up [ fall away ; stumble ] .
EXB	Mark	4	18	Others are like the seed planted among the thorny weeds . They hear the ·teaching [ word ; message ] ,
EXB	Mark	4	19	but the worries of this ·life [ world ; age ] , the ·temptation [ deceitfulness ; seduction ] of wealth , and ·many other evil desires [ desires for other things ] ·keep the teaching from growing and producing fruit in their lives [ L come in and choke the word , making it unfruitful ] .
EXB	Mark	4	20	Others are like the seed ·planted [ sown ] in the good ground . They hear the ·teaching [ word ; message ] and accept it . Then they grow and produce ·fruit [ a crop ] —sometimes thirty times more , sometimes sixty times more , and sometimes a hundred times more. ” Use What You Have ( D )
EXB	Mark	4	21	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do you hide a lamp under a ·bowl [ basket ] or under a bed ? No ! You put the lamp on a lampstand .
EXB	Mark	4	22	[ For ] Everything that is hidden will be ·made clear [ revealed ; disclosed ] and every ·secret [ concealed ] thing will be ·made known [ brought to light/into the open ] .
EXB	Mark	4	23	·Let those with ears use them and listen ! [ L “ If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear. ” ]
EXB	Mark	4	24	[ And he said to them , ] “ ·Think carefully about [ Pay attention to ] what you hear . ·The way you give to others is the way God will give to you [ or The standard you use to judge others will be the standard used for you ; L With the measure you measure , it will be measured to you ] , ·but God will give you even more [ and even more will be added to you ] .
EXB	Mark	4	25	Those who ·have understanding [ L have ] will be given more . But those who do not ·have understanding [ L have ] , even what they have will be taken away from them . [ C The Greek does not say what they have ; but the context suggests spiritual understanding to comprehend the mysteries of the kingdom ( v .
EXB	Mark	4	26	Then Jesus said , “ The kingdom of God is like someone who ·plants seed in [ scatters seed on ] the ground .
EXB	Mark	4	27	Night and day , whether the person is asleep or awake , the seed still [ sprouts and ] grows , but the person does not know how it grows .
EXB	Mark	4	28	By itself the earth produces grain . First the ·plant [ blade ; stalk ] grows , then the head , and then ·all the [ the ripe ] grain in the head .

EXB	Mark	4	30	Then Jesus said , “ How can I show you what the kingdom of God is like ? What ·story [ parable ; see 3:23 ] can I use to explain it ?
EXB	Mark	4	31	The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed , the smallest seed you plant in the ground . [ C The mustard seed was the smallest seed known to Jesus ’ hearers . ]
EXB	Mark	4	32	But when planted , this seed grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants . It produces large branches , and the wild birds can make nests in its shade. ”
EXB	Mark	4	33	Jesus used many ·stories [ parables ] like these to teach the crowd God ’ s ·message [ word ] —as much as they could ·understand [ hear ] .

EXB	Mark	4	39	Jesus stood up and ·commanded [ reprimanded ; rebuked ] the wind and said to the ·waves [ sea ] , “ ·Quiet ! [ T Peace ! ] Be still ! ” Then the wind stopped , and it became completely calm . [ C This parallels God ’ s subduing of the waters representing chaos in the OT ; Ps . 65:7 ; 89:9 ; 107:29 . ]
EXB	Mark	4	40	Jesus said to ·his followers [ L them ] , “ Why are you afraid ? Do you still have no faith ? ”
EXB	Mark	4	41	They were ·very afraid [ terrified ; filled with awe ] and asked each other , “ Who is this ? Even the wind and the ·waves [ sea ] obey him ! ”
EXB	Mark	5	5	Day and night he would wander around the ·burial caves [ tombs ] and on the hills , screaming and ·cutting [ bruising ] himself with stones .
EXB	Mark	5	2	When Jesus got out of the boat , immediately a man with an ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ] spirit came to him from the ·burial caves [ tombs ; cemetery ] .
EXB	Mark	5	3	This man lived in the ·caves [ tombs ] , and no one could tie him up [ any more ] , not even with a chain .
EXB	Mark	5	4	[ For ] Many times people had used [ shackles and ] chains to tie the man ’ s hands and feet , but he always ·broke them off [ tore apart the chains and smashed the shackles ] . No one was strong enough to ·control [ subdue ] him .
EXB	Mark	5	6	While Jesus was still far away , the man saw him , ran to him , and ·fell [ bowed ] down before him .
EXB	Mark	5	7	The man shouted in a loud voice , “ ·What do you want with me [ Let me alone ; What business do we have with each other ; L What to me and to you ; see 1:24 ] , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ?

EXB	Mark	5	8	He said this because Jesus was saying to him , “ You ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ] spirit , come out of the man. ”
EXB	Mark	5	9	Then Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ My name is Legion [ C a legion was about 5,000 soldiers in the Roman army ] , because we are many spirits. ”
EXB	Mark	5	10	He begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of that ·area [ land ; region ] .
EXB	Mark	5	11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill near there .
EXB	Mark	5	12	The demons begged Jesus , “ Send us into the pigs ; let us go into them. ”
EXB	Mark	5	13	So Jesus allowed them to do this . The ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ] spirits left the man and went into the pigs . Then the herd of pigs—about two thousand of them—rushed down the ·hill [ steep bank ; precipice ] into the lake and were drowned .
EXB	Mark	5	14	The herdsmen ran away and went to the town and to the countryside , telling everyone about this . So people went out to see what had happened .
EXB	Mark	5	15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to have ·the many evil spirits [ L the “ legion ” ] , sitting , clothed , and in his right mind . And they were frightened .
EXB	Mark	5	16	The people who saw this told the others what had happened to the man who had ·the demons living in him [ been demon-possessed ] , and they told about the pigs .
EXB	Mark	5	17	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area .
EXB	Mark	5	18	As Jesus was getting back into the boat , the man who ·was freed from the demons [ had been demon-possessed ] begged to go with him .
EXB	Mark	5	19	But Jesus would not let him . He said , “ Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you. ”
EXB	Mark	5	20	So the man left and began to ·tell [ proclaim/preach to ] the people in the ·Ten Towns [ or Decapolis ; C a league of ten cities east of Lake Galilee ] about what Jesus had done for him . And everyone was amazed . Jesus Gives Life to a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman ( B )

EXB	Mark	5	23	He begged Jesus , ·saying again and again [ earnestly saying ] , “ My daughter is dying . Please come and ·put [ lay ] your hands on her so she will be healed and will live. ”
EXB	Mark	5	24	So Jesus went with him . A large crowd followed Jesus and pushed very close around him .

EXB	Mark	5	26	She had suffered very much from many doctors and had spent all the money she had , but instead of improving , she was getting worse .
EXB	Mark	5	27	When the woman heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his ·coat [ cloak ; garment ] .
EXB	Mark	5	28	[ L For ] She ·thought [ said ] , “ If I can just touch his clothes , I will ·be healed [ get well ; be saved ] . ”
EXB	Mark	5	29	Instantly her bleeding stopped , and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease .
EXB	Mark	5	30	At once Jesus ·felt [ perceived ] power go out from him . So he turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothes ? ”
EXB	Mark	5	31	His ·followers [ disciples ] said , “ Look at how many people are pushing against you ! And you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
EXB	Mark	5	32	But Jesus continued looking around to see who had touched him .
EXB	Mark	5	33	The woman , knowing that she was healed , came and fell at Jesus ’ feet . Shaking with fear , she told him the whole truth .
EXB	Mark	5	34	Jesus said to her , “ ·Dear woman [ L Daughter ] , ·you are made well because you believed [ your faith has saved/healed you ] . Go in peace ; be healed of your disease. ”

EXB	Mark	5	36	But Jesus ·paid no attention to [ or overheard ] what they said . He told the synagogue leader , “ Don ’ t be afraid ; just believe. ”
EXB	Mark	5	37	Jesus let only Peter , James , and John the brother of James go with him .
EXB	Mark	5	38	When they came to the house of the synagogue leader , Jesus found many people there making lots of noise and ·crying loudly [ L weeping and wailing loudly ] .
EXB	Mark	5	39	Jesus entered the house and said to them , “ Why are you ·crying [ weeping ] and making so much noise ? The child is not dead , only asleep. ”
EXB	Mark	5	40	But they ·laughed at [ ridiculed ] him . So , after ·throwing [ putting ] them [ L all ] out of the house , Jesus took the child ’ s father and mother and his three followers into the room where the child was .
EXB	Mark	5	41	Taking hold of the girl ’ s hand , he said to her , “ Talitha , koum ! ” ( This means [ C in Aramaic , the language Jesus commonly spoke ] , “ Little girl , I tell you to stand up ! ” )

And where did he get the power to do ·miracles [ L such mighty works done by his hands ] ?
EXB	Mark	6	3	·He is just [ L Isn ’ t this… ? ] the carpenter , the son of Mary and the brother of James , Joseph [ C Greek : Joses ] , Judas , and Simon . ·And his sisters are [ L Are not his sisters… ? ] here with us. ” So the people were ·upset with [ offended by ] Jesus .
EXB	Mark	6	4	Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is ·honored everywhere [ not dishonored ] except in his hometown and with his own ·people [ relatives ; kin ] and in his own ·home [ household ] . ”
EXB	Mark	6	5	So Jesus was not able to work any miracles there except to heal a few sick people by ·putting [ laying ] his hands on them .
EXB	Mark	6	7	He called ·his twelve followers [ L the Twelve ] together and ·got ready [ began ] to send them out two by two and gave them authority over ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ] spirits .

EXB	Mark	9	34	But they did not answer , because their ·argument [ discussion ] on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .
EXB	Mark	9	35	Jesus sat down and called ·the twelve apostles [ the Twelve ] to him . He said , “ Whoever wants to be ·the most important [ first ] must be last of all and servant of all. ”
EXB	Mark	9	36	Then Jesus took a small child and had ·him [ or her ; C the Greek here does not specify gender ] stand among them . Taking the child in his arms , he said ,
EXB	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever ·accepts [ welcomes ; receives ] a child like this in my name [ C as a representative or follower of Jesus ] accepts me . And whoever ·accepts [ welcomes ; receives ] me accepts [ not only me , but ] the One who sent me. ” [ C Children had low social status , so the saying indicates concern for the lowly . ] Anyone Not Against Us Is for Us ( E )
EXB	Mark	9	38	Then John said , “ Teacher , we saw someone using your name [ C invoking your authority ] to ·force [ drive ; cast ] demons out of a person . We told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group. ”
EXB	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , “ Don ’ t stop him , because anyone who uses my name to do powerful things will not ·easily [ quickly ] say evil things about me .
EXB	Mark	9	40	Whoever is not against us is ·with [ for ] us .
EXB	Mark	9	41	I tell you the truth , whoever gives you a drink of water because you belong to the ·Christ [ Messiah ] will ·truly get [ L certainly not lose ] his reward .
EXB	Mark	9	42	“ If someone causes one of these little children who believes in me to ·sin [ lose faith ; stumble ] , it would be better for that person to have a ·large stone [ large millstone ; L millstone of a donkey ] tied around his neck and be ·drowned [ L thrown ] in the sea .
EXB	Mark	9	43	] .
EXB	Mark	9	45	If your foot causes you to ·sin [ lose faith ; stumble ] , cut it off . It is better for you ·to lose part of your body and to live forever [ L to enter life crippled ] than to have two feet and be thrown into ·hell [ Gehenna ; v.
EXB	Mark	9	47	If your eye causes you to ·sin [ lose faith ; stumble ] , take it out . It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into ·hell [ Gehenna ; v.
EXB	Mark	9	48	In hell the worm does not die ; the fire is never put out .
EXB	Mark	9	49	Every person will be salted with fire . [ C The meaning of this proverb is uncertain ; it may mean that the testing of believers purifies ( fire ) and preserves ( salt ) ; or it may refer to believers as God ’ s covenant people , since salt and fire were part of the OT sacrificial system ; see Lev . 2:3 ; Num . 18:9 . ]
EXB	Mark	9	50	“ Salt is good , but if the salt loses its salty taste , you can not make it salty again . So , ·be full of salt [ L have salt in/among yourselves ; C salt here may symbolize fellowship within the covenant ] , and have peace with each other . ”
EXB	Mark	10	10	Later , in the house , his ·followers [ disciples ] asked Jesus again about ·the question of divorce [ L this matter ] .
EXB	Mark	10	2	Sam . 7:11–16 ] , ·have mercy [ take pity ] on me ! ”
EXB	Mark	10	3	Jesus answered , “ What did Moses command you to do ? ”
EXB	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moses ·allowed [ permitted ] a man to write out divorce papers and send her away [ Deut . 24:1 ] . ”
EXB	Mark	10	5	Jesus said , “ Moses wrote that command for you because you were ·stubborn [ hard hearted ] .
EXB	Mark	10	6	But ·when God made the world [ from the beginning of creation ] , ‘ he made them male and female ’ [ Gen. 1:27 ; 5:2 ] .
EXB	Mark	10	7	‘ So a man will leave his father and mother and be ·united with [ joined to ] his wife , [ a ]
EXB	Mark	10	8	and the two will become ·one body [ as though they were one person ; T one flesh ; Gen. 2:24 ] ’ . So they are no longer two , but one .
EXB	Mark	10	9	God has joined the two together , so no one should separate them. ”
EXB	Mark	10	11	He answered , “ Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman ·is guilty of [ commits ] adultery against her .
EXB	Mark	10	12	And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man ·is also guilty of [ commits ] adultery. ” Jesus Accepts Children ( B )
EXB	Mark	10	13	Some people brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch them , but his ·followers [ disciples ] ·told them to stop [ scolded/rebuked them ] .
EXB	Mark	10	14	When Jesus saw this , he was ·upset [ angry ; indignant ] and said to them , “ Let the little children come to me . Don ’ t stop them , because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children [ C meaning humble and dependent ] .
EXB	Mark	10	15	I tell you the truth , you must accept the kingdom of God as if you were a little child , or you will never enter it. ”
EXB	Mark	10	16	Then Jesus took the children in his arms , ·put [ laid ] his hands on them , and blessed them . A Rich Young Man ’ s Question ( C )
EXB	Mark	10	17	As Jesus started ·to leave [ on his way ; on a journey ] , a man ran to him and ·fell on his knees [ knelt ] before Jesus . The man asked , “ Good teacher , what must I do to ·have life forever [ L inherit eternal life ] ? ”
EXB	Mark	10	18	Jesus answered , “ Why do you call me good ? ·Only God is good [ No one is good except One—God ; C Jesus is not denying his own divinity , but is challenging the man ’ s understanding of goodness ] .
EXB	Mark	10	19	You know the commands : ‘ You must not murder . You must not ·be guilty of [ commit ] adultery . You must not steal . You must not ·tell lies about your neighbor [ testify falsely ; T bear false witness ] . You must not ·cheat [ defraud ] . Honor your father and mother ’ [ Ex . 20:12–16 ; Deut . 5:16–20 ] . ”
EXB	Mark	10	20	The man said , “ Teacher , I have ·obeyed [ kept carefully ; guarded ] all these things since I was a boy. ”
EXB	Mark	10	21	Jesus , looking at the man , loved him and said , “ There is one more thing you need to do . Go and sell everything you have , and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
EXB	Mark	10	22	He was ·very sad [ shocked ; appalled ] to hear Jesus say this , and he left ·sorrowfully [ grieving ] , because he ·was rich [ had many possessions ] .
EXB	Mark	10	23	Then Jesus looked [ around ] at his ·followers [ disciples ] and said , “ How hard it will be for ·the rich [ those with many possessions ] to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
EXB	Mark	10	24	The ·followers [ disciples ] were ·amazed [ astonished ] at what Jesus said . [ C In Judaism wealth was generally viewed as a reward from God . ] But he said again , “ My children , it is very hard [ b ] to enter the kingdom of God !
EXB	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God [ C meaning it is impossible , by human effort ; see v.
EXB	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , “ ·For people [ Humanly speaking , ] this is impossible , but for God all things are possible. ”
EXB	Mark	10	26	They were even more ·surprised [ amazed ] and said to each other , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
EXB	Mark	10	28	Peter ·said [ spoke up ] to Jesus , “ Look , we have left everything and followed you. ”
EXB	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , all those who have left houses , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or ·farms [ fields ] for me and for the ·Good News [ Gospel ]
EXB	Mark	10	30	will get more than they left . Here in ·this world [ the present age ] they will have a hundred times more homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and ·fields [ farms ] . And with those things , ·they will also suffer for their belief [ persecutions ] . But in the ·age [ world ] that is coming they will have ·life forever [ eternal life ] .
EXB	Mark	10	31	Many who are first now will be last in the future . And many who are last now will be first in the future. ” Jesus Talks a Third Time About His Death ( D )
EXB	Mark	10	32	As Jesus and the people with him were on the road to Jerusalem , he was leading the way . His ·followers [ disciples ] were ·amazed [ surprised ; puzzled ; alarmed ] , but others in the crowd who followed were afraid . Again Jesus took ·the twelve apostles [ the Twelve ] aside and began to tell them what was about to happen [ to him ] in Jerusalem .
EXB	Mark	10	33	He said , “ Look , we are going [ L up ] to Jerusalem . The Son of Man will be ·turned over [ betrayed ; delivered over ; see 9:31 ] to the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] . They will ·say that he must die [ condemn him to death ] , and they will turn him over to the ·Gentiles [ C the Roman authorities ] ,
EXB	Mark	10	34	who will laugh at him and spit on him . They will beat him with whips and ·crucify [ L kill ] him . But after three days , he will rise to life again. ” Two Followers Ask Jesus a Favor ( E )
EXB	Mark	10	35	Then James and John , sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus and said , “ Teacher , we want ·to ask you to do something for us [ you to do whatever we ask ] . ”
EXB	Mark	10	36	Jesus asked , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
EXB	Mark	10	37	They answered , “ Let one of us sit at your right side and one of us sit at your left side in your glory [ C the messianic kingdom ] . ”
EXB	Mark	10	38	Jesus said , “ You don ’ t understand what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I must drink ? And can you be baptized with the same kind of baptism that I must go through ? ” [ C Both “ cup ” and “ baptism ” symbolize suffering , and perhaps God ’ s judgment experienced by Jesus on the cross ; Jer . 25:15–29 . ]
EXB	Mark	10	39	They answered , “ Yes , we can. ” Jesus said to them , “ You will drink the same cup that I will drink , and you will be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through .
EXB	Mark	10	40	But ·I can not choose [ it is not for me to grant/say ] who will sit at my right or my left ; those places belong to those for whom they have been prepared. ”
EXB	Mark	10	41	When ·the other ten followers [ L the ten ] heard this , they began to be ·angry [ indignant ] with James and John .
EXB	Mark	10	42	Jesus called them together and said , “ You know that the rulers of ·other nations [ the Gentiles ] love to ·show their power [ lord it ] over the people , and their ·important leaders [ high officials ; L great ones ] love to ·use [ exert ] their authority [ L over them ] .
EXB	Mark	10	43	But it ·should not be [ must not be ; is not to be ] that way among you . [ Instead , L But ] Whoever wants to become great among you must ·serve the rest of you like a servant [ L be your servant ] .
EXB	Mark	10	44	Whoever wants to become the first among you must ·serve all of you like a slave [ L be your slave ] .
EXB	Mark	10	45	In the same way , the Son of Man did not come to be served . He came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people [ Is . 53:12 ; John 11:49–50 ] . ” Jesus Heals a Blind Man ( F )
EXB	Mark	10	46	Then they came to the town of Jericho . As Jesus was leaving there with his ·followers [ disciples ] and a great many people , a blind beggar named Bartimaeus [ which means ] son of Timaeus was sitting by the road .
EXB	Mark	10	47	When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David [ C a title for the Messiah , a descendant of King David ;
EXB	Mark	10	48	Many people ·warned [ rebuked ; scolded ] the blind man to be quiet , but he shouted even more , “ Son of David , ·have mercy [ take pity ] on me ! ”
EXB	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Tell the man to come here. ” So they called the blind man , saying , “ ·Cheer up [ Take courage ] ! Get to your feet . Jesus is calling you. ”
EXB	Mark	10	50	The blind man jumped up , ·left his coat there [ threw off his cloak ] , and went to Jesus .
EXB	Mark	10	51	Jesus asked him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man answered , “ ·Teacher [ L Rabbouni ] , I want to see. ”
EXB	Mark	10	52	Jesus said , “ Go , ·you are healed because you believed [ your faith has healed you ] . ” At once the man could see , and he followed Jesus on the road . Footnotes - Mark 10:7 and … wife Some Greek copies do not have this phrase . - Mark 10:24 hard Some Greek copies continue , “ for those who trust in riches . ”
EXB	Mark	11	11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple . After he had looked [ around ] at everything , since it was already late , he went out to Bethany with ·the twelve apostles [ the Twelve ] .
EXB	Mark	11	2	and said to them , “ Go to the town ·you can see there [ ahead of you ; or opposite you C either Bethphage , Bethany , or another village ] . When you enter it , you will ·quickly [ immediately ] find a ·colt [ young donkey ] tied , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here to me .
EXB	Mark	11	3	If anyone asks you why you are doing this , tell him ·its Master [ the Lord ; or its Owner ] needs the colt and ·he will send it at once [ or he will return it soon ; C “ he ” could be either Jesus or the colt ’ s owner ] . ”
EXB	Mark	11	4	They went into the town , found a colt tied in the street near the door of a house , and untied it .
EXB	Mark	11	5	Some people were standing there and asked , “ What are you doing ? Why are you untying that colt ? ”
EXB	Mark	11	6	They answered the way Jesus told them to answer , and the people let them take the colt .
EXB	Mark	11	7	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it , and Jesus sat on it [ Zech . 9:9 ] .
EXB	Mark	11	8	Many people spread their coats on the road . Others cut [ leafy ] branches in the fields and spread them on the road .
EXB	Mark	11	9	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him , shouting , “ ·Praise God ! [ L Hosanna ! C A Hebrew word originally used in praying for help , but by this time a joyful shout of praise to God . ] ·God bless [ Blessed is ] the One who comes in the name of the Lord [ Ps . 118:26 ] !
EXB	Mark	11	10	·God bless [ Blessed is ] the coming kingdom of our father David ! ·Praise to God in heaven [ L Hosanna in the highest ] ! ”
EXB	Mark	11	12	The next day as Jesus was leaving Bethany , he became hungry .
EXB	Mark	11	13	Seeing a fig tree in leaf from far away , he went to see if it had any figs on it . But he found no figs , only leaves , because it was not the right season for figs .
EXB	Mark	11	14	So Jesus said to the tree , “ May no one ever eat fruit from you again. ” And Jesus ’ ·followers [ disciples ] heard him say this . Jesus Goes to the Temple ( B )
EXB	Mark	11	15	When Jesus ·returned [ came ] to Jerusalem , he went into the ·Temple [ temple complex ; C the large temple area , not the inner building where only the priests could go ] and began to ·throw [ drive ] out those who were buying and selling there . He turned over the tables of ·those who were exchanging different kinds of money [ L the moneychangers ] , and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves [ or pigeons ; C moneychangers provided particular coins for the temple tax ; doves or pigeons were sold for sacrifices ; Lev . 5:7 ] .
EXB	Mark	11	16	Jesus refused to allow anyone to carry goods through the Temple courts .
EXB	Mark	11	17	Then he taught the people , saying , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My ·Temple [ L House ] will be called a house for prayer for people from all nations ’ [ Is . 56:7 ] . But you ·are changing God ’ s house [ L have made it ] into a · ‘ hideout for robbers ’ [ T den of thieves ’ ; Jer . 7:11 ] . ”
EXB	Mark	11	18	The ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] heard all this and began trying to find a way to kill Jesus . They were afraid of him , because all the people were amazed at his teaching .
EXB	Mark	11	19	That evening , Jesus and his ·followers [ a ] [ disciples ] left the city . The Power of Faith ( C )
EXB	Mark	11	20	The next morning as Jesus was passing by with his ·followers [ disciples ] , they saw the fig tree ·dry and dead [ withered ] , even to the roots .
EXB	Mark	11	21	Peter ·remembered the tree and said to Jesus , “ ·Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , look ! The fig tree you cursed is ·dry and dead [ withered ] ! ”
EXB	Mark	11	22	Jesus answered , “ Have faith in God .
EXB	Mark	11	23	I tell you the truth , you can say to this mountain , ‘ ·Go [ Be lifted up ] , fall into the sea. ’ And if you have no doubts in your ·mind [ heart ] and believe that what you say will happen , ·God will do it for you [ it will be done for you ] .
EXB	Mark	11	24	So I tell you to believe that you have received ·the things [ everything ] you ask for in prayer , and ·God will give them to you [ you will receive them ] .
EXB	Mark	11	25	When you ·are praying [ L stand praying ] , if you ·are angry with [ have anything against ] someone , forgive him so that your Father in heaven will also forgive your ·sins [ transgressions ; trespasses ] . |26 But if you don ’ t forgive other people , then your Father in heaven will not forgive your ·sins [ transgressions ; trespasses ] .| ” [ b ] Leaders Doubt Jesus ’ Authority ( D )
EXB	Mark	11	27	Jesus and his ·followers [ disciples ] went again to Jerusalem . As Jesus was walking in the Temple [ complex ; area ; courts ; see 11:15 ] , the ·leading [ T chief ] priests , the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] , and the elders came to him .
EXB	Mark	11	28	They said to him , “ What authority do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? ”
EXB	Mark	11	29	Jesus answered , “ I will ask you one question . If you answer me , I will tell you what authority I have to do these things .
EXB	Mark	11	30	Tell me : When John baptized people , was that authority from ·God [ L heaven ; C a reverential Jewish way of referring to God ] or just from ·other people [ human beings ] ? ”
EXB	Mark	11	31	They argued about Jesus ’ question , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from ·God [ L heaven ] , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why didn ’ t you believe him ? ’
EXB	Mark	11	32	But if we say , ‘ It was from ·other people [ human beings ] , ’ the crowd will be against us. ” ( These leaders were afraid of the people , because all the people believed that John was a prophet . )
EXB	Mark	11	33	So they answered Jesus , “ We don ’ t know. ” Jesus said to them , “ Then I won ’ t tell you what authority I have to do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:19 his followers Some Greek copies mention only Jesus here . - Mark 11:26 But … sins . Some Greek copies do not contain the bracketed text .
EXB	Mark	12	12	The Jewish leaders knew that the ·story [ parable ] was about them . So they ·wanted to find a way [ were seeking/trying ] to arrest Jesus , but they were afraid of the people . So the leaders left him and went away . Is It Right to Pay Taxes or Not ? ( B )
EXB	Mark	12	2	Sam . 7:12 ] ?
EXB	Mark	12	3	But the farmers grabbed ·the servant [ L him ] and beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
EXB	Mark	12	4	Then the man sent another ·servant [ slave ] . They ·hit [ beat ] him on the head and ·showed no respect for [ humiliated ; dishonored ] him .
EXB	Mark	12	5	So the man sent another , whom they killed . The man sent many others ; the farmers beat some of them and killed others [ C the servants represent the prophets God sent to Israel ] .
EXB	Mark	12	6	“ The man had one person left to send , his son whom he loved [ C representing Jesus ; see 1:11 ; 9:7 ] . He sent him last of all , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
EXB	Mark	12	7	“ But the farmers said to each other , ‘ This son will inherit the vineyard . Let ’ s kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ’
EXB	Mark	12	8	So they took the son , killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
EXB	Mark	12	9	“ So what will the ·owner [ lord ] of the vineyard do ? He will come and ·kill [ destroy ] those farmers and will give the vineyard to ·other farmers [ L others ; C referring to the sinners who were responding to Jesus ’ call for repentance , and eventually to the Gentiles who would be saved ] .

EXB	Mark	12	13	Later , the Jewish leaders sent some Pharisees and Herodians [ C a political group that supported king Herod and his family ; 3:6 ] to Jesus to ·trap [ catch ] him in saying something wrong .
EXB	Mark	12	14	They came to him and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are ·an honest man [ true ; honest ; sincere ] . You are not ·afraid of [ concerned about ] what other people think about you , because you ·pay no attention to who they are [ play no favorites ; are impartial ; aren ’ t swayed by appearances ] . And you teach ·the truth [ with sincerity/honesty ] about God ’ s way . Tell us : Is it ·right [ permissible ; lawful ] to pay taxes to Caesar or not ?
EXB	Mark	12	15	Should we pay them , or not ? ” [ C Saying “ yes ” would anger Jews who hated Roman rule ; saying “ no ” could result in being charged with insurrection . ] But knowing ·what these men were really trying to do [ L their hypocrisy ] , Jesus said to them , “ Why are you ·trying to trap [ testing ] me ? Bring me a ·coin [ L denarius ; C a Roman coin worth a day ’ s wages ] to look at. ”
EXB	Mark	12	16	They gave Jesus a coin , and he asked , “ Whose ·image [ likeness ; portrait ] and ·name [ inscription ] are on the coin ? ” They answered , “ Caesar ’ s. ” [ C Ironically , the religious leaders carry coins bearing the idolatrous image of Caesar . ]
EXB	Mark	12	17	Then Jesus said to them , “ ·Give [ T Render ] to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and give to God the things that are God ’ s. ” They were amazed at what Jesus said . Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus ( C )
EXB	Mark	12	18	Then some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question . ( Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead . )
EXB	Mark	12	19	They said , “ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man ’ s brother dies , leaving a wife but no children , then that man must marry the widow and ·have children [ L raise up offspring/seed ] for his brother [ Deut . 25:5 ] .
EXB	Mark	12	20	Once there were seven brothers . The first brother ·married [ L took a wife ] and died , leaving no children .
EXB	Mark	12	21	So the second brother married the widow , but he also died and had no children . The same thing happened with the third brother .
EXB	Mark	12	22	All seven brothers married her and died , and none of the brothers had any children . Finally the woman died too .
EXB	Mark	12	23	Since all seven brothers had married her , ·when people rise from the dead [ L at the resurrection ] , whose wife will she be ? ”
EXB	Mark	12	24	Jesus answered , “ ·You are mistaken [ L Are you not mistaken/in error… ? ] because you don ’ t know what the Scriptures say , and don ’ t you know about the power of God .
EXB	Mark	12	25	[ L For ] When people rise from the dead , they will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry . They will be like the angels in heaven .
EXB	Mark	12	26	·Surely you have read [ L Have you not read… ? ] what God said about people rising from the dead . In the book in which Moses wrote about the burning bush [ Ex . 3:1–12 ] , it says that God told Moses , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob [ Ex . 3:6 ; C God is still the God of the patriarchs , so they must have a continued existence after death ] . ’
EXB	Mark	12	27	God is the God of the living , not the dead . You Sadducees are ·wrong [ greatly deceived ; badly mistaken ] ! ” The Most Important Command ( D )
EXB	Mark	12	28	One of the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] came and heard Jesus arguing with the Sadducees . Seeing that Jesus gave good answers to their questions , he asked Jesus , “ Which of the commands is most important ? ”
EXB	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The most important command is this : ‘ ·Listen , people of Israel [ T Hear , O Israel ] ! The Lord our God is ·the only Lord [ one Lord ] .
EXB	Mark	12	30	Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your mind , and all your strength ’ [ Deut . 6:4–5 ; C these are the opening words of the Shema , the prayer said by pious Jews twice a day ] .
EXB	Mark	12	31	The second command is this : ‘ Love your neighbor as you love yourself ’ [ Lev . 19:18 ] . There are no commands ·more important [ greater ] than these. ”
EXB	Mark	12	32	The man answered , “ ·That was a good answer [ Well said ! ] , Teacher . You were right when you said God is ·the only Lord [ one ] and there is no other God besides him .
EXB	Mark	12	33	One must love God with all his heart , all his mind , and all his strength . And one must love his neighbor as he loves himself . These commands are more important than all the ·animals [ burnt offerings ] and sacrifices we offer to God [
EXB	Mark	12	1	Sam . 15:22 ; Hos . 6:6 ; Mic . 6:6–8 ] . ”
EXB	Mark	12	34	When Jesus saw that the man answered him ·wisely [ thoughtfully ; with insight ] , Jesus said to him , “ You are close to the kingdom of God. ” And after that , no one ·was brave enough [ dared ] to ask Jesus any more questions . The Question About David ’ s Son ( E )
EXB	Mark	12	35	As Jesus was teaching in the Temple [ courts ; complex ] , he asked , “ Why do the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] say that the ·Christ [ Messiah ] is the ·son [ descendant ] of David [ C see
EXB	Mark	12	36	David himself , speaking by the Holy Spirit , said : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right ·side [ L hand ; C the place of greatest honor beside the king ] , until I put your enemies ·under your control [ L beneath your feet ; C meaning defeated or made subject to your authority ; Ps . 110:1 ] . ” ’
EXB	Mark	12	37	David himself calls ·the Christ [ the Messiah ; L him ] ‘ Lord , ’ so how can ·the Christ [ the Messiah ; L he ] be his son ? ” The large crowd listened to Jesus with pleasure .
EXB	Mark	12	38	Jesus continued teaching and said , “ Beware of the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] . They like to walk around ·wearing fancy clothes [ in long robes ] , and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces .
EXB	Mark	12	39	They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and at ·feasts [ banquets ] .
EXB	Mark	12	40	But they ·cheat widows and steal their houses [ L devour widows ’ homes ] and then try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers [ in public ] . They will receive a greater ·punishment [ judgment ; condemnation ] . ” True Giving ( F )
EXB	Mark	12	41	Jesus sat near the Temple ·money box [ offering chest ; or treasury ] and watched the people put in their money . Many rich people gave large sums of money .
EXB	Mark	12	42	Then a poor widow came and put in ·two small copper coins [ L two lepta ] , ·which were only worth a few cents [ L which is a quadrans ; C a Roman coin worth 1/64 of a denarius , or about
EXB	Mark	12	43	Calling his ·followers [ disciples ] to him , Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow gave more than all those rich people .
EXB	Mark	12	44	They gave ·only what they did not need [ out of their surplus/abundance ] . This woman is very poor , but she gave all she had—everything she had to live on . ”

EXB	Luke	8	11	“ This is what the ·story [ parable ] means : The seed is God ’ s ·message [ word ] .
EXB	Luke	8	12	The seed that fell ·beside the road [ along the footpath ] is like the people who hear God ’ s teaching , but [ L then ] the devil comes and takes it away from ·them [ L their hearts ] so they can not believe it and be saved .
EXB	Luke	8	13	The seed that fell on rock is like those who hear God ’ s teaching and ·accept [ receive ] it ·gladly [ L with joy ] , but they ·don ’ t allow the teaching to go deep into their lives [ L have no root ] .

EXB	Luke	8	15	And the seed that fell on the good ground is like those who hear ·God ’ s teaching [ the word ] with good , honest hearts and ·obey [ cling/hold to ] it and ·patiently [ with perseverance ] produce good fruit . Use What You Have ( B )

I beg you , don ’ t ·torture [ torment ] me ! ”
EXB	Luke	8	29	He said this because Jesus was commanding [ reprimanding ; rebuking ] the ·evil [ defiling ; L unclean ; 4:33 ] spirit to come out of the man . Many times it had ·taken hold of [ seized ; taken control of ] him . Though he had been kept under guard and chained hand and foot , he had broken his chains and had been ·forced [ driven ] by the demon out into ·a lonely place [ the desert/wilderness ] .
EXB	Luke	8	30	Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He answered , “ Legion , ” because many demons ·were in [ had entered ] him [ C a legion was about five thousand Roman soldiers ; the sense here is “ many ” ] .
EXB	Luke	8	31	The demons begged Jesus not to ·send them [ L command them to depart ] into ·eternal darkness [ the bottomless pit ; L the Abyss ] .

EXB	Luke	8	37	All the ·people [ crowd ; multitude ] of the Gerasene ·country [ region ] asked Jesus to leave [ L them ] , because they were all ·very afraid [ overwhelmed/seized with great fear ] . So Jesus got into the boat and ·went back across the lake [ left ; L returned ] .

EXB	Luke	14	31	“ If a king is going to ·fight [ meet in battle ; wage war against ] another king , first ·he will [ L will he not… ? ] sit down and plan . He will decide if he and his ten thousand soldiers can ·defeat [ L engage/meet in battle ] the other king who has twenty thousand soldiers .
EXB	Luke	14	32	If he can ’ t , then while the other king is still far away , he will send ·some people [ an embassy ; a messenger ] to speak to him and ask for [ terms of ] peace .

EXB	Luke	15	2	But the Pharisees and the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] began to ·complain [ murmur ; grumble ] : “ Look , this man ·welcomes [ associates with ; receives ] sinners and even eats with them [ C indicating social acceptance ] . ”
EXB	Luke	15	3	·Then [ So ] Jesus told them this ·story [ parable ] :
EXB	Luke	15	4	“ Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep but loses one of them . ·Then he will [ L Won ’ t he… ? ] leave the other ninety-nine sheep in the ·open field [ wilderness ; desert ] and go out and look for the lost sheep until he finds it .

EXB	Luke	15	7	In the same way , I tell you there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who ·changes his heart and life [ repents ] , than over ninety-nine ·good [ righteous ; C self-righteous ] people who don ’ t need to ·change [ repent ] .

EXB	Luke	15	11	Then Jesus said , “ A man had two sons .
EXB	Luke	15	12	The younger son said to his father , ‘ Father , give me my share of the ·property [ estate ; C his inheritance ] . ’ So the father divided the ·property [ wealth ; assets ; L life ] between his two sons .
EXB	Luke	15	13	·Then [ Some time later ; L After not many days ] the younger son gathered up all that was his and traveled ·far away to another [ to a distant ] country . There he ·wasted [ squandered ; scattered ] his money in ·foolish [ wild ; reckless ] living .

EXB	Luke	16	2	So he called the manager in and said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give me a ·report [ accounting ] of ·what you have done with my money [ L your management ] , because you ·can ’ t be my manager any longer [ are going to be fired ] . ’
EXB	Luke	16	3	The manager thought to himself , ‘ What will I do since my master is ·taking my job away from [ about to fire ] me ? I am not strong enough to ·dig ditches [ or work the soil ; L dig ] , and I am ashamed to beg .
EXB	Luke	16	4	I know what I ’ ll do so that when I ·lose my job [ L am removed from management ] people will welcome me into their homes. ’
EXB	Luke	16	5	“ So the manager called in everyone who owed the master any money . He asked the first one , ‘ How much do you owe [ L my master ] ? ’
EXB	Luke	16	6	He answered , ‘ Eight hundred gallons [ C Greek : one hundred batoi ; a batos was about eight gallons ] of olive oil. ’ The manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and write ·four hundred gallons [ Greek : fifty ( batoi ) ] . ’
EXB	Luke	16	7	Then the manager asked another one , ‘ How much do you owe ? ’ He answered , ‘ ·One thousand bushels [ Greek : one hundred koroi ; a koros was about ten bushels ] of wheat. ’ Then the manager said to him , ‘ Take your bill and write eight hundred bushels [ C Greek : eighty ( koroi ) ] . ’
EXB	Luke	16	8	So , the master praised the ·dishonest [ unrighteous ; unjust ] manager for being ·clever [ shrewd ; prudent ] . Yes , ·worldly people [ L the children of this age ] are more ·clever [ shrewd ; prudent ] with their own ·kind [ contemporaries ; generation ] than ·spiritual people [ L the children of light ] are .
EXB	Luke	16	9	“ I tell you , make friends for yourselves using ·worldly riches [ L the mammon/wealth of unrighteousness ] so that when those riches ·are gone [ fail ; run out ] , you will be welcomed in ·those homes that continue forever [ eternal dwellings/tents ; C God ’ s presence ] .

EXB	Luke	16	14	The Pharisees , who loved money , were listening to all these things and ·made fun of [ derided ; ridiculed ] Jesus .
EXB	Luke	16	15	He said to them , “ You ·make yourselves look good [ justify yourselves ] in front of people , but God knows what is really in your hearts . What is ·important to [ exalted/esteemed by ] people is ·hateful [ detestable ; an abomination ] in God ’ s sight .

EXB	Luke	16	18	“ If a man divorces his wife and marries another woman , he ·is guilty of [ commits ] adultery , and the man who marries a divorced woman ·is also guilty of [ commits ] adultery. ” The Rich Man and Lazarus
EXB	Luke	16	19	Jesus said , “ There was a rich man who always dressed in ·the finest clothes [ L purple and fine linen ] and ·lived in luxury [ or feasted sumptuously ] every day .
EXB	Luke	16	20	And a very poor man named Lazarus , whose body was covered with sores , was laid at the rich man ’ s gate .
EXB	Luke	16	21	He ·wanted [ longed ] to eat ·only the small pieces of food that fell [ L what fell ] from the rich man ’ s table . ·And [ Even ] the dogs would come and lick his sores [ C dogs were viewed as despicable scavengers , not household pets ] .
EXB	Luke	16	22	·Later [ L Now it happened that ] , Lazarus died , and the angels carried him to ·the arms of Abraham [ L Abraham ’ s side/T bosom ; C the imagery of a banquet , with Abraham as host and Lazarus as honored guest ] . The rich man died , too , and was buried .

EXB	Luke	16	24	He called , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me ! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I am ·suffering [ in agony ] in this fire [ Is . 66:24 ] ! ’
EXB	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember when you were alive you had the good things in life , but bad things happened to Lazarus . Now he is comforted here , and you are ·suffering [ in agony ] .
EXB	Luke	16	26	Besides [ L all this ] , there is a ·big pit [ great gulf/chasm set in place ] between you and us , so no one can cross over to you , and no one can leave there and come ·here [ L to us ] . ’
EXB	Luke	16	27	The rich man said , ‘ Father , then ·please [ I ask/beg you to ] send Lazarus to my father ’ s house .
EXB	Luke	16	28	[ L For ] I have five brothers , and Lazarus could warn them so that they will not come to this place of ·pain [ torment ] . ’
EXB	Luke	16	29	But Abraham said , ‘ They have ·the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets [ L Moses and the prophets ] ; let them ·learn from [ listen to ] them. ’
EXB	Luke	16	30	The rich man said , ‘ No , father Abraham ! [ L But ] If someone goes to them from the dead , they would ·believe and change their hearts and lives [ L repent ] . ’
EXB	Luke	16	31	But Abraham said to him , ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , they will not ·listen to [ L be persuaded/convinced by ] someone who comes back from the dead . ’ ”

EXB	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Give us more faith ! ”
EXB	Luke	17	6	The Lord said , “ If your faith were the size of a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ ·Dig yourself up [ Be uprooted ] and plant yourself in the sea , ’ and it would obey you . Be Good Servants

EXB	Luke	18	9	Jesus told this ·story [ parable ] to some people who ·thought they were very good [ were confident of their own righteousness ] and ·looked down on [ scorned ; despised ] everyone else :
EXB	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up to the Temple [ courts ] to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector [ C despised by their fellow Jews because they worked for the hated Romans and were notorious for extortion ] .
EXB	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee ·stood alone and prayed [ or stood and prayed about himself ] , ‘ God , I thank you that I am not like other people—thieves , ·cheaters [ evildoers ; unrighteous people ] , adulterers—or even like this tax collector .

EXB	Luke	18	14	I tell you , when this man went home , he was ·right with God [ justified ] , ·but the Pharisee was not [ L rather than that ( other ) man ] .

EXB	Luke	18	15	Some people brought even their babies to Jesus so he could touch them . When the ·followers [ disciples ] saw this , they ·told them to stop [ scolded/rebuked them ] .
EXB	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called for the children , saying , “ Let the little children come to me . Don ’ t ·stop [ hinder ; forbid ] them , because the kingdom of God belongs to people who are like these children [ C meaning humble and dependent ] .
EXB	Luke	18	17	I tell you the truth , you must ·accept [ receive ] the kingdom of God as if you were a child , or you will never enter it. ” A Rich Man ’ s Question ( B )
EXB	Luke	18	19	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? ·Only God is good [ L No one is good except one—God ; C Jesus is not denying his own divinity , but is challenging the man ’ s understanding of goodness ] .
EXB	Luke	18	20	You know the commands : ‘ You must not ·be guilty of [ commit ] adultery . You must not murder anyone . You must not steal . You must not ·tell lies [ testify falsely ] about your neighbor . Honor your father and mother [ Ex . 20:12–16 ; Deut . 5:16–20 ] . ’ ”
EXB	Luke	18	21	But the leader said , “ I have ·obeyed [ kept carefully ; guarded ] all these commands since ·I was a boy [ my youth ] . ”
EXB	Luke	18	22	When Jesus heard this , he said to him , “ There is still one more thing you ·need to do [ lack ] . Sell everything you have and give it to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come and follow me. ”
EXB	Luke	18	23	But when the man heard this , he became very sad , because he was ·very [ extremely ] rich .
EXB	Luke	18	24	·Jesus looked at him and [ or When Jesus saw this reaction , he ] said , “ ·It is very hard [ L How hard it is… ! ] for ·rich people [ L those who have wealth ] to enter the kingdom of God .

EXB	Luke	18	28	Peter said , “ Look , we have left ·everything [ or our possessions ; or our home ] and followed you. ”
EXB	Luke	18	29	Jesus said , “ I tell you the truth , all those who have left houses , wives , brothers [ or siblings ] , parents , or children ·for [ for the sake of ] the kingdom of God

EXB	Luke	18	35	As Jesus came near the city of Jericho , a blind man was sitting beside the road , begging .
EXB	Luke	18	36	When he heard the people ·coming down the road [ passing by ] , he asked , “ What is happening ? ”
EXB	Luke	18	37	They told him , “ Jesus , ·from Nazareth [ or the Nazarene ] , is going by. ”
EXB	Luke	18	38	The blind man cried out , “ Jesus , Son of David [ C a title for the Messiah , a descendant of King David ;
EXB	Luke	18	39	The people leading the group ·warned [ rebuked ; scolded ] the blind man to be quiet . But the blind man shouted even more , “ Son of David , ·have mercy [ take pity ] on me ! ”
EXB	Luke	18	40	Jesus stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to him . When he came near , Jesus asked him ,
EXB	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He said , “ Lord , I want to see. ”
EXB	Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him , “ Then see . ·You are healed because you believed [ Your faith has healed/saved you ] . ”
EXB	Luke	18	43	At once the man was able to see , and he followed Jesus , thanking God . All the people who saw this praised God .
EXB	Luke	19	19	The king said to this servant , ‘ You can ·rule [ be ; take charge ] over five cities. ’

EXB	Luke	19	4	He ran ahead to a place where Jesus ·would come [ was about to pass ] , and he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .
EXB	Luke	19	5	When Jesus came to that place , he looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down ! [ L For ; Because ] I must stay at your house today. ”
EXB	Luke	19	6	Zacchaeus came down quickly and welcomed him ·gladly [ joyfully ] .
EXB	Luke	19	7	All the people saw this and began to ·complain [ murmur ; grumble ] , “ Jesus ·is staying with [ has gone in to lodge with/be the guest of ] a sinner ! ”
EXB	Luke	19	8	But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord [ C the scene presumably changes here to a meal at Zacchaeus ’ home ] , “ [ L Look ; T Behold ] I ·will give [ or I am now giving ] half of my possessions to the poor . And ·if I have cheated anyone [ or to those I have cheated/extorted ] , I will pay back four times more [ C a generous response , since the law required only restitution plus one-fifth ; Lev . 6:1–5 ] . ”
EXB	Luke	19	9	Jesus said to him , “ Salvation has come to this house today , because this man also ·belongs to the family [ L is a son ] of Abraham .
EXB	Luke	19	10	[ L For ; Because ] The Son of Man came to ·find [ seek out ] lost people and save them. ” A Story About Three Servants ( A )
EXB	Luke	19	11	As ·the people [ L they ; C either the disciples , the guests of Zacchaeus , or the larger crowd ] were listening to this , Jesus told them a ·story [ parable ] because he was near Jerusalem and ·they thought [ it seemed to them ] God ’ s kingdom would appear immediately .
EXB	Luke	19	12	He said : “ A ·very important man [ nobleman ] went to a country far away to ·be made a king [ L receive a kingdom ] and then to return home [ C Judean kings , like Herod the Great and his son Archelaus , received their authority to rule from the emperor in Rome ] .
EXB	Luke	19	13	So he called ten of his ·servants [ slaves ] and gave a coin [ C Greek : mina ; worth
EXB	Luke	19	100	denarii , or about
EXB	Luke	19	14	But ·the people in the kingdom [ L his citizens/subjects ] hated the man . So they sent a ·group [ delegation ; embassy ] to follow him and say , ‘ We don ’ t want this man to ·be our king [ L rule/reign over us ] . ’
EXB	Luke	19	15	“ But the man ·became king [ L received the kingdom ] . When he returned home , he said , ‘ Call those ·servants [ slaves ] who have my money so I can know how much they earned with it. ’
EXB	Luke	19	16	“ The first servant came and said , ‘ Sir , ·I earned ten coins with the one you gave me [ L your mina has earned ten minas ] . ’
EXB	Luke	19	17	The king said to the servant , ‘ Excellent ! ·You are a good servant [ Good servant/slave ! ] . Since ·I can trust you [ you have been faithful ] with small things , I will let you ·rule [ govern ; L have authority ] over ten of my cities. ’
EXB	Luke	19	18	“ The second servant said , ‘ Sir , ·I earned five coins with your one [ L your mina earned five minas ] . ’
EXB	Luke	19	20	“ Then another servant came in and said to the king , ‘ Sir , here is your ·coin [ mina ] which I ·wrapped [ stored away ] in a ·piece of cloth [ handkerchief ] and hid .
EXB	Luke	19	21	[ L For ; Because ] I was afraid of you , because you are a ·hard [ harsh ; demanding ; severe ] man . You even take ·money that [ L out what ] you didn ’ t ·earn [ L put in ] and ·gather food that [ harvest what ] you didn ’ t ·plant [ sow ] . ’
EXB	Luke	19	22	Then the king said to the servant , ‘ I will ·condemn [ judge ] you ·by your own words [ L from your mouth ] , you ·evil [ wicked ; or worthless ] servant . You knew that I am a ·hard [ harsh ; demanding ; severe ] man , taking ·money that [ L out what ] I didn ’ t ·earn [ L put in ] and ·gathering food that [ L harvesting what ] I didn ’ t ·plant [ sow ] .
EXB	Luke	19	23	Why then didn ’ t you put my money ·in the bank [ L on the table ; C referring to the banker ’ s table ] ? Then when I came back , my money would have earned some interest. ’
EXB	Luke	19	24	“ ·The king [ He ] said to the men who were standing by , ‘ Take the ·coin [ L mina ] away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten ·coins [ L minas ] . ’
EXB	Luke	19	25	They said , ‘ But sir , that servant already has ten ·coins [ L minas ] . ’
EXB	Luke	19	26	·The king said [ L I say to you ] , ‘ Those who have will be given more , but those who do not have anything ·will have everything [ L even what they have will be ] taken away from them .
EXB	Luke	19	27	Now ·where are my enemies [ or concerning those enemies ] who didn ’ t want me to ·be king [ rule/reign over them ] ? Bring them here and ·kill [ slay ; slaughter ] them before me. ’ ” Jesus Enters Jerusalem as a King ( B )
EXB	Luke	19	28	After Jesus said this , he went on [ L ahead , going up ] toward Jerusalem .
EXB	Luke	19	29	As Jesus came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives , he sent out two of his ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	Luke	19	30	He said , “ Go to the town ·you can see there [ ahead of you ; or opposite you ; C unclear whether Bethphage or Bethany ] . When you enter it , you will find a ·colt [ young donkey ] tied there , which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here to me .
EXB	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you why you are untying it , say that ·the Master [ the Lord ; or its Owner ] needs it. ”
EXB	Luke	19	32	The two ·followers [ L who were sent ] went into town and found ·the colt [ or the situation ] just as Jesus had told them .
EXB	Luke	19	33	As they were untying it , its ·owners [ masters ] came out and asked the followers , “ Why are you untying our ·colt [ young donkey ] ? ”
EXB	Luke	19	34	The followers answered , “ ·The Master [ The Lord ; Its Owner ] needs it. ”
EXB	Luke	19	35	So they brought it to Jesus , threw their ·coats [ garments ] on the ·colt ’ s [ young donkey ’ s ] back , and put Jesus on it .
EXB	Luke	19	36	As Jesus rode toward Jerusalem , others spread their coats on the ·road [ path ; way ] before him .
EXB	Luke	19	37	As he was coming close to Jerusalem , on the way down the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of ·followers [ disciples ] began joyfully shouting praise to God for all the ·miracles [ mighty works ] they had seen .
EXB	Luke	19	38	They said , “ ·God bless [ Blessed is ] the king who comes in the name of the Lord [ Ps . 118:26 ] ! ·There is peace [ or May there be peace ; L Peace ] in heaven and glory ·to God [ L in the highest ; C either “ in highest heaven ” or “ to the Most High God ” ] ! ”
EXB	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus , “ Teacher , ·tell your followers not to say these things [ L rebuke your disciples ] . ”
EXB	Luke	19	40	But Jesus answered , “ I tell you , if ·my followers didn ’ t say these things [ L they remained silent ] , then the stones would ·cry out [ start shouting ] . ” Jesus Cries for Jerusalem
EXB	Luke	19	41	As Jesus came near Jerusalem , he saw the city and ·cried for [ wept over ] it ,
EXB	Luke	19	42	saying , “ ·I wish you [ L If you , even you , ] ·knew [ recognized ] today what would bring you peace . But now it is hidden from ·you [ L your eyes ] .
EXB	Luke	19	43	·The time is coming [ L For the days will come upon you ] when your enemies will build ·a wall around you [ ramparts against your walls ] and will ·hold you in [ L surround and close you in ] on all sides .
EXB	Luke	19	44	They will ·destroy you [ level you ; smash you to the ground ] and all your ·people [ L children within your walls ] , and not one stone will be left on another . All this will happen because you did not recognize the time ·when God came to save you [ L of your visitation ; C the failure to recognize God ’ s “ visit ” in Jesus ( see 1:68 ,
EXB	Luke	19	78	) will result in a divine “ visit ” in judgment ] . ” Jesus Goes to the Temple ( C )
EXB	Luke	19	45	Jesus went into the Temple and began to ·throw [ drive ] out the people who were selling things there .
EXB	Luke	19	46	He said , “ It is written in the Scriptures , ‘ My ·Temple [ L House ] will be a house for prayer [ Is . 56:7 ] . ’ But you have ·changed [ made ] it into a ‘ ·hideout for robbers ’ [ T den of thieves ; Jer . 7:11 ] ! ”
EXB	Luke	19	47	Jesus ·taught [ was teaching ] in the Temple every day . The ·leading [ T chief ] priests , the ·experts on the law [ scribes ] , and some of the leaders of the people ·wanted [ were looking for a way ] to ·kill [ destroy ] Jesus .
EXB	Luke	19	48	But they ·did not know how they could [ could not find a way to ] do it , because all the people were ·listening closely to him [ hanging on his every word ] .
EXB	Luke	20	20	So they watched Jesus and sent some spies who acted as if they were ·sincere [ honest ; righteous ] . They wanted to trap Jesus in saying something wrong so they could hand him over to the ·authority [ jurisdiction ; rule ] and ·power [ authority ] of the governor .
EXB	Luke	20	2	Sam . 7:12–16 ] ?
EXB	Luke	20	3	Jesus answered , “ I will also ask you a question . Tell me :
EXB	Luke	20	4	When John baptized people , was that authority from ·God [ L heaven ; C a reverent Jewish way of referring to God ] or just from ·other people [ human beings ] ? ”
EXB	Luke	20	5	They ·argued about this [ L discussed this among themselves ] , saying , “ If we answer , ‘ John ’ s baptism was from ·God [ L heaven ] , ’ Jesus will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
EXB	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ It was from ·other people [ human beings ] , ’ all the people will stone us to death , because they ·believe [ are convinced that ] John was a prophet. ”
EXB	Luke	20	7	So they answered that they didn ’ t know where it came from .
EXB	Luke	20	8	Jesus said to them , “ Then I won ’ t tell you what authority I have to do these things. ” The Story of the Evil Farmers ( B )
EXB	Luke	20	9	Then Jesus ·told [ L began/proceeded to tell ] the people this ·story [ parable ] : “ A man planted a vineyard and leased it to some [ C tenant ] farmers [ C Jesus builds on Is . 5:1–7 ; the owner represents God ; the farmers are Israel ’ s religious leaders ] . Then he ·went away [ took a journey ] for a long time .
EXB	Luke	20	10	·When it was time for the grapes to be picked [ L At the ( harvest ) time ] , he sent a ·servant [ slave ] to the farmers to get some of the grapes [ C the portion of the harvest to pay the rent ] . But they beat him and sent him away empty-handed .
EXB	Luke	20	11	Then he sent another ·servant [ slave ] . They beat him also , and ·showed no respect for [ humiliated ; dishonored ] him , and sent him away empty-handed .
EXB	Luke	20	12	So the man sent a third . The farmers wounded him and threw him out [ C the servants represent the prophets God sent to Israel ] .
EXB	Luke	20	13	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What will I do now ? I will send my son whom I love [ C representing Jesus ; see 3:22 ] . ·Maybe [ or Probably ; or Surely ] they will respect him. ’
EXB	Luke	20	14	But when the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ‘ This ·son will inherit the vineyard [ L is the heir ] . Let ’ s kill him so the inheritance will be ours. ’
EXB	Luke	20	15	So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him . “ What will the ·owner [ lord ] of the vineyard do to them ?
EXB	Luke	20	16	He will come and ·kill [ destroy ] those farmers and will give the vineyard to ·other farmers [ L others ; C referring to the sinners who were responding to Jesus ’ call for repentance , and eventually to the Gentiles who would be saved ] . ” When the people heard this ·story [ parable ] , they said , “ ·Let this never happen [ T God forbid ; L May it not happen ] ! ”
EXB	Luke	20	17	But Jesus looked [ directly ; intently ] at them and said , “ Then what does this Scripture passage mean : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected became the ·cornerstone [ or capstone ; or keystone ; L head of the corner ] ’ ? [ C This is the most important stone in the building ; Jesus is the rejected stone ; Ps . 118:22 . ]
EXB	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken [ Is . 8:14 ] , and the person on whom it falls , that person will be crushed [ cf . Dan . 2:34 ] ! ”
EXB	Luke	20	19	The ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] and the ·leading [ T chief ] priests ·wanted [ tried/sought ] to ·arrest [ seize ; L lay hands on ] Jesus at once , because they knew the ·story [ parable ] was ·about [ told against ] them . But they were afraid of what the people would do . Is It Right to Pay Taxes or Not ? ( C )
EXB	Luke	20	21	So the spies asked Jesus , “ Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is ·true [ right ; correct ] . You ·pay no attention to who people are [ play no favorites ; are impartial ; aren ’ t swayed by appearances ] , and you always teach ·the truth [ with sincerity/honesty ] about God ’ s way .
EXB	Luke	20	22	Tell us , is it ·right [ permissible ; lawful ] for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ” [ C Saying yes would anger Jews who hated Roman rule ; saying no could result in being charged with insurrection . ]
EXB	Luke	20	23	But Jesus , knowing ·they were trying to trick him [ L their craftiness/duplicity ] , said ,
EXB	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a ·coin [ L denarius ] . Whose ·image [ likeness ; portrait ] and ·name [ inscription ; title ] are on it ? ” They said , “ Caesar ’ s. ” [ C Ironically , the religious leaders carry coins bearing the idolatrous image of Caesar . ]
EXB	Luke	20	25	Jesus said to them , “ Then ·give [ give back ; T render ] to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and ·give [ give back ; T render ] to God the things that are God ’ s. ”
EXB	Luke	20	26	So they were not able to ·trap [ catch ] Jesus in anything he said in the presence of the people . And being amazed at his answer , they ·became silent [ kept quiet ] . Some Sadducees Try to Trick Jesus ( D )
EXB	Luke	20	27	Some Sadducees , who believed people would not rise from the dead , came to Jesus .
EXB	Luke	20	28	They asked , “ Teacher , Moses wrote that if a man ’ s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children , then that man must marry the widow and ·have children [ L raise up offspring/seed ] for his brother [ Deut . 25:5–6 ] .
EXB	Luke	20	29	Once there were seven brothers . The first brother ·married [ L took a wife ] and died , but had no children .
EXB	Luke	20	30	Then the second brother married the widow , and he died .
EXB	Luke	20	31	And the third brother married the widow , and he died . The same thing happened with all seven brothers ; they died and had no children .
EXB	Luke	20	32	Finally , the woman died also .
EXB	Luke	20	33	Since all seven brothers had married her , whose wife will she be ·when people rise from the dead [ L at the resurrection ] ? ”
EXB	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ ·On earth , people [ L The children of this age ] marry and are given to someone to marry .
EXB	Luke	20	35	But those who will be worthy ·to be raised from the dead and live again [ L of the age to come and the resurrection ] will not marry , nor will they be given to someone to marry .
EXB	Luke	20	36	[ L For ] In that life they are ·like [ or equal to ] angels and can not die . They are children of God , because they ·have been raised from the dead [ are children of the resurrection ] .
EXB	Luke	20	37	Even Moses clearly showed that the dead are raised to life . When he wrote about the burning bush [ Ex . 3:1–12 ] , he said that the Lord is ‘ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob [ Ex . 3:6 ; C God is still the God of the patriarchs , so they must have a continued existence after death ] . ’
EXB	Luke	20	38	God is the God of the living , not the dead , because all people are alive to him. ”
EXB	Luke	20	39	Some of the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] said , “ Teacher , ·your answer was good [ well said ! ] . ”
EXB	Luke	20	40	No one ·was brave enough [ dared ] to ask him another question . Is the Christ the Son of David ? ( E )
EXB	Luke	20	41	Then Jesus said , “ Why do people say that the ·Christ [ Messiah ] is the Son of David [
EXB	Luke	20	42	[ L For ; Since ] In the book of Psalms , David himself says : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit by me at my right ·side [ L hand ] ,
EXB	Luke	20	43	until I put your enemies ·under your control [ L as a footstool for your feet ; C meaning defeated or made subject to your authority ; Ps . 110:1 ] . ” ’
EXB	Luke	20	44	David calls ·the Christ [ the Messiah ; L him ] ‘ Lord , ’ so how can ·the Christ [ the Messiah ; L he ] be his son ? ” Jesus Accuses Some Leaders ( F )
EXB	Luke	20	45	While all the people were listening , Jesus said to his ·followers [ disciples ] ,
EXB	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] . They like to walk around wearing ·fancy clothes [ or flowing robes ] , and they love for people to greet them with respect in the marketplaces . They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues [ 11:43 ] and [ the place of highest honor ] at ·feasts [ banquets ] .
EXB	Luke	20	47	But they ·cheat widows and steal their houses [ L devour widows ’ homes ] and ·then try to make themselves look good by saying [ L with false motives pray ] long prayers . They will receive a greater ·punishment [ condemnation ] . ”
EXB	Luke	21	21	At that time , the people in Judea should run away to the mountains . The people in Jerusalem must get out , and those who are ·near the city [ in the countryside ] should not go in .
EXB	Luke	21	2	Then he saw a poor widow putting two small copper coins [ C Greek : lepta ; worth only 1/128 of a denarius , the daily wage of a worker ] into the box .
EXB	Luke	21	3	He said , “ I tell you the truth , this poor widow gave more than all those rich people .
EXB	Luke	21	4	[ L For ] They gave ·only what they did not need [ out of their surplus/abundance ] . ·This woman is very poor , but she gave [ L But she , out of her poverty , gave ] all she had to live on. ” The Temple Will Be Destroyed ( B )
EXB	Luke	21	5	Some ·people [ or of the disciples ] were talking about the Temple and how it was ·decorated [ adorned ] with beautiful stones and gifts offered to God . But Jesus said ,
EXB	Luke	21	6	“ As for these things you are looking at , the ·time [ days ] will come when not one stone will be left on another . Every stone will be ·thrown [ torn ] down. ”
EXB	Luke	21	7	They asked Jesus , “ Teacher , when will these things happen ? What will be the sign that they are about to take place ? ”
EXB	Luke	21	8	Jesus said , “ ·Be careful [ Watch out ] so you are not ·fooled [ deceived ; led astray ] . [ L For ; Because ] Many people will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am ·the One [ or he ; C the Messiah ] ’ and , ‘ The time ·has come [ or is near ] ! ’ But don ’ t follow them .
EXB	Luke	21	9	When you hear about wars and ·riots [ uprisings ; insurrections ] , don ’ t be ·afraid [ terrified ] , because these things must happen first , but the end will ·come later [ not come immediately ] . ”
EXB	Luke	21	10	Then he said to them , “ Nations will ·fight [ L rise up ] against other nations , and kingdoms against other kingdoms .
EXB	Luke	21	11	In various places there will be great earthquakes , ·sicknesses [ plagues ; pestilences ] , and ·a lack of food [ famines ] . ·Fearful [ Terrifying ] events and great signs will come from heaven .
EXB	Luke	21	12	“ But before all these things happen , people will ·arrest [ seize ; L lay their hands on ] you and ·treat you cruelly [ persecute you ] . They will ·judge you in their [ drag you into the ; L hand you over to ] synagogues and put you in jail and force you to stand before kings and governors , because ·you follow me [ of your allegiance to me ; L of my name ] .
EXB	Luke	21	13	But this will give you an opportunity to ·tell [ testify ; bear witness ] about me .
EXB	Luke	21	14	[ L So ; Therefore ] ·Make up your minds [ Resolve ; L Put it in your hearts ] not to ·worry [ or rehearse ] ahead of time about what you will say [ 12:11 ] .
EXB	Luke	21	15	[ L For ] I will give you ·the wisdom to say things [ words and wisdom ] that none of your enemies will be able to ·stand against [ resist ] or ·prove wrong [ refute ; contradict ] .
EXB	Luke	21	16	Even your parents , brothers [ and sisters ] , relatives , and friends will ·turn against you [ betray you ; L hand you over ] , and they will kill some of you .
EXB	Luke	21	17	All people will hate you because ·you follow me [ L of my name ] .
EXB	Luke	21	18	But ·none of these things can really harm you [ L not a hair on your head will perish ; C a metaphor for living forever with God ] .
EXB	Luke	21	19	By ·continuing to have faith [ your endurance/perseverance ] you will ·save your lives [ or gain/win your souls ] . Jerusalem Will Be Destroyed ( C )
EXB	Luke	21	20	“ When you see armies all around Jerusalem , you will know ·it will soon be destroyed [ L its desolation draws near/is at hand ] .
EXB	Luke	21	22	These are the days of ·punishment [ vengeance ; retribution ] to ·bring about [ fulfill ] all that is written in the Scriptures .
EXB	Luke	21	23	·How terrible it will be for [ L Woe to ] women who are pregnant or have nursing babies [ L in those days ] ! [ L For ; Because ] Great ·trouble [ distress ; calamity ] will come upon this land , and ·God will be angry with these people [ L wrath will come against this people ] .
EXB	Luke	21	24	They will ·be killed by [ L fall by the mouth of ] the sword and taken as ·prisoners [ captives ] to all nations . Jerusalem will be ·crushed [ trampled ] by Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles is ·over [ fulfilled ] . Don ’ t Fear ( D )
EXB	Luke	21	25	“ There will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars . On earth , nations will be ·afraid [ distressed ] and confused because of the roar and ·fury [ surging waves ] of the sea .
EXB	Luke	21	26	People will be so afraid they will ·faint [ or lose all hope ] , wondering what is ·happening to [ coming upon ] the world , because the ·powers of the heavens [ or heavenly bodies ] will be shaken .
EXB	Luke	21	27	Then people will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory [ Dan . 7:13 ] .
EXB	Luke	21	28	When these things begin to happen , ·look up [ or stand up ] and hold your heads high , because ·the time when God will free you [ your redemption/liberation ] is ·near [ at hand ] ! ” Jesus ’ Words Will Live Forever ( E )
EXB	Luke	21	29	Then Jesus told this ·story [ parable ] : “ Look at the fig tree and all the other trees .

EXB	Luke	21	37	During the day , Jesus taught the people in the Temple , and at night he went out of the city and stayed on the Mount of Olives .

EXB	Luke	22	12	Then he will show you a large , furnished room upstairs . Prepare the Passover meal there. ”
EXB	Luke	22	2	The ·leading [ T chief ] priests and ·teachers of the law [ scribes ] were trying to find a way to ·kill [ destroy ; eliminate ] Jesus , ·because [ or but ] they were afraid of the people [ C because of Jesus ’ popularity ] .

EXB	Luke	22	4	Judas went to the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the officers of the Temple guard and talked to them about a way to ·hand Jesus over [ betray Jesus ] to them .
EXB	Luke	22	5	They were ·pleased [ delighted ] and agreed to give Judas money .
EXB	Luke	22	6	He ·agreed [ consented ] and watched for ·the best [ an opportune ] time to ·hand Jesus over [ betray Jesus ] to them when he was away from the crowd . Jesus Eats the Passover Meal ( B )
EXB	Luke	22	7	The Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lambs had to be sacrificed .
EXB	Luke	22	8	Jesus said to Peter and John , “ Go and prepare the Passover meal for us to eat. ”
EXB	Luke	22	9	They asked , “ Where do you want us to prepare it ? ”
EXB	Luke	22	10	Jesus said to them , “ [ Pay attention ; L Look ; T Behold ] After you go into the city , a man carrying a jar of water will meet you . Follow him into the house that he enters ,

EXB	Luke	24	11	But they did not believe the women , because it ·sounded [ seemed ] like nonsense .
EXB	Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Bending down and looking in , he saw only the [ linen ] cloth that Jesus ’ body had been wrapped in . Peter went away to his home , ·wondering [ amazed ; marveling ] about what had happened . Jesus on the Road to Emmaus ( B )

EXB	Luke	24	18	The one named Cleopas answered , “ ·Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not [ or Are you only a visitor in Jerusalem and don ’ t ] know what just happened there ? ”
EXB	Luke	24	19	Jesus said to them , “ What ·are you talking about [ L things ] ? ” They said , “ About Jesus of Nazareth . He was a prophet ·who said and did many powerful things [ L powerful in deed and word ] before God and all the people .

EXB	Luke	24	30	When Jesus ·was at the table [ L reclined ; C the posture of a formal meal ] with them , he took some bread , ·gave thanks [ blessed it ] , ·divided [ broke ] it , and gave it to them [ C Jesus , the guest , functions like the host in a Eucharist-like meal ] .

EXB	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It is ·I myself [ really me ] ! Touch me and see , because a ·ghost [ spirit ] does not have ·a living body [ L flesh and bones ] as you see I have. ”
EXB	Luke	24	40	After Jesus said this , he showed them his hands and feet .
EXB	Luke	24	41	While they still could not believe it because they were happy [ joyful ] and amazed , Jesus said to them , “ Do you have any food here ? ”

We saw his ·glory [ majesty ] —the glory that belongs to the ·only Son [ one and only ; T only begotten ] ·of [ who came from ] the Father—and he was full of ·grace and truth [ God ’ s gracious love and faithfulness ; Ex . 34:5–7 ] .
EXB	John	1	15	John ·tells the truth about [ testifies concerning ; witnesses about ] him and cries out , saying , “ This is the One I told you about : ‘ The One who comes after me [ C in time ] is greater than I am , because he ·was living [ existed ] before me [ C a reference to Christ ’ s preexistence ; 1:1–2 ] . ’ ”
EXB	John	1	16	·Because he was full of grace and truth [ L From his fullness ; 1:14 ] , from him we all received ·one gift after another [ L grace for grace ; C this could mean abundant grace or that the grace under Christ replaced grace under the law ] .
EXB	John	1	17	The law was given through Moses [ Ex . 19—24 ] , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
EXB	John	1	18	No one has ever seen God [ C God the Father , who is pure spirit ; 4:24 ] . But ·God the only Son [ a ] [ God the one and only ; the only Son who is himself God ; T God the only begotten ] is ·very close to [ by the side of ; close to the heart of ; T in the bosom of ] the Father , and he has ·shown us what God is like [ made him known ] . John the Baptist Tells People About Jesus ( A )
EXB	John	1	19	Here is the ·truth John told [ testimony John gave ; witness of John ; 1:6 ] when the ·leaders [ Jewish leadership ; L Jews ; C John often uses the term “ Jews ” to refer to the religious leaders in opposition to Jesus , rather than to the Jewish people generally ] in Jerusalem sent ·priests and Levites [ C the religious authorities ; priests oversaw temple worship ; Levites were members of the tribe of Levi who assisted them ;
EXB	John	1	20	John ·spoke freely [ confessed ] and did not ·refuse to answer [ deny it ] . He said , “ I am not the ·Christ [ Messiah ] . ”
EXB	John	1	21	So they asked him , “ Then who are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” [ C Elijah , an OT prophet , was expected to come back before the Messiah ;
EXB	John	1	22	Then they said , “ Who are you ? Give us an answer to tell those who sent us . What do you say about yourself ? ”
EXB	John	1	23	John told them in the words of the prophet Isaiah : “ I am the voice of one calling out in the ·desert [ wilderness ] : ‘ Make ·the road straight [ a clear path ] for the Lord [ Is . 40:3 ] . ’ ”
EXB	John	1	24	Some Pharisees [ C a religious party which strictly observed OT laws and later customs ] who had been sent asked John :
EXB	John	1	25	“ If you are not the ·Christ [ Messiah ] or Elijah or the Prophet [ 1:21 ] , why do you baptize people ? ”
EXB	John	1	26	John answered , “ I baptize with water , but there is one here with you that you don ’ t ·know about [ recognize ] .
EXB	John	1	27	He is the One who comes after me . I am not ·good enough [ worthy ; fit ] to untie the ·strings [ straps ] of his sandals. ” [ C Removing sandals was the task of a slave . ]
EXB	John	1	28	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River [ C a site east of the Jordan River , not the Bethany near Jerusalem ] , where John was baptizing people .
EXB	John	1	29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him . John said , “ Look , the Lamb of God [ C lambs were used for sacrifice ; Gen. 22:8 ] , who takes away the sin of the world !
EXB	John	1	30	This is the One I was talking about [ 1:15 ] when I said , ‘ A man will come after me , but he is greater than I am , because he ·was living [ existed ] before me. ’
EXB	John	1	31	Even I did not ·know [ recognize ] who he was , although I came baptizing with water so that ·the people of Israel would know who he is [ he might be revealed to Israel ] . ” The First Followers of Jesus
EXB	John	1	35	The next day John [ C the Baptist ; 1:6 ] was [ standing ] there again with two of his ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	John	1	36	When he saw Jesus walking by , he said , “ Look , the Lamb of God [ see 1:29 ] ! ”
EXB	John	1	37	The two ·followers [ disciples ] heard John say this , so they followed Jesus .
EXB	John	1	38	When Jesus turned and saw them following him , he asked , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said , “ Rabbi , where are you staying ? ” ( “ Rabbi ” means “ Teacher. ” )
EXB	John	1	39	He answered , “ Come and see. ” So the two men went with Jesus and saw where he was staying and stayed there with him that day . It was about ·four o ’ clock in the afternoon [ L the tenth hour ; C hours were counted from dawn , about
EXB	John	1	40	One of the two men who followed Jesus after they heard John speak about him was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
EXB	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him , “ We have found the Messiah. ” ( “ Messiah ” means “ Christ. ” ) [ C Both Hebrew Mashiach ( Messiah ) and Greek Christos ( Christ ) mean “ Anointed One. ” ]
EXB	John	1	42	Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas. ” ( “ Cephas ” means “ Peter. ” ) [ C Both Aramaic Cephas and Greek Petros mean “ rock. ” ]
EXB	John	1	43	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee [ C a region about
EXB	John	1	50	Jesus said to Nathanael , “ Do you believe simply because I told you I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than that. ”
EXB	John	1	44	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida [ C a town just to the north of the Sea of Galilee ] , where Andrew and Peter lived .
EXB	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law , and the prophets also wrote about him . [ C The law and the prophets refer to the OT Scriptures . ] He is Jesus , the son of Joseph , from Nazareth [ C a village a few miles southwest of the Sea of Galilee ] . ”
EXB	John	1	46	But Nathanael said to Philip , “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” [ C This is because of its insignificance and lack of mention in the OT . ] Philip answered , “ Come and see. ”
EXB	John	1	47	As Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said , “ Here is truly an Israelite . There is ·nothing false [ no deceit ; no guile ] in him. ”
EXB	John	1	48	Nathanael asked , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered , “ I saw you when you were under the fig tree , before Philip ·told you about me [ L called you ] . ”
EXB	John	1	49	Then Nathanael said to Jesus , “ Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , you are the Son of God ; you are the King of Israel. ”
EXB	John	1	51	And Jesus said to them , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , you will all see heaven open and ‘ angels of God going up and coming down ’ [ C a reference to Jacob ’ s dream in Gen. 28:12 ] on the Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] . ”
EXB	John	2	2	and Jesus and his ·followers [ disciples ] were also invited to the wedding .
EXB	John	2	3	When all the wine was gone , Jesus ’ mother said to him , “ They have no more wine. ”
EXB	John	2	4	Jesus answered , “ ·Dear woman [ L Woman ; C a respectful form of address in that culture ] , ·why come to me [ what concern is that to me and to you ; L what to me and to you ] ? My ·time [ L hour ; C here and throughout John , Jesus ’ “ hour ” refers to his messianic sacrifice on the cross ] has not yet come. ”
EXB	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you to do. ”
EXB	John	2	6	In that place there were six stone water jars that the Jews used in their washing ceremony [ C a Jewish ritual before eating , before worshiping in the Temple , and at other special times ] . Each jar held about twenty or thirty gallons [ C Greek : two or three metretai ; each about nine gallons or forty liters ] .
EXB	John	2	7	Jesus said to the servants , “ Fill the jars with water. ” So they filled the jars to the ·top [ brim ] .
EXB	John	2	8	] a ·place for buying and selling [ L a house of market/trade ] ! ”
EXB	John	2	9	When he tasted it , the water had become wine . He did not know where the wine came from , but the servants who had brought the water knew . The ·master of the wedding [ chief steward ; headwaiter ] called the bridegroom
EXB	John	2	10	and said to him , “ People always serve the ·best [ expensive ] wine first . Later , after the guests have been drinking awhile [ C and are less discriminating ] , they serve the ·cheaper [ inferior ] wine . But you have saved the ·best [ expensive ] wine till now. ”
EXB	John	2	11	So in Cana of Galilee [ see 2:1 ] Jesus did his first ·miracle [ L sign ; C Jesus ’ miracles are called semeia , “ signs , ” in John ’ s Gospel ] . There he ·showed [ revealed ; manifested ] his ·glory [ majesty ] , and his ·followers [ disciples ] believed in him . Jesus in the Temple ( A )
EXB	John	2	12	] , Jesus ·went [ L went up ] to Jerusalem .
EXB	John	2	13	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast [ C annual festival that celebrates God ’ s rescue of Israel from Egypt ; Ex .
EXB	John	2	14	In the Temple [ area ; C not in the Temple proper , but in the outer courtyard , the Court of the Gentiles ] he found people selling cattle , sheep , and ·doves [ or pigeons ; C for sacrifices in the Temple ] . ·He saw others sitting at tables , exchanging different kinds of money [ L …and moneychangers sitting ; C the annual temple tax ( Ex . 30:11–16 ) had to be paid in Tyrian shekels , because of their high quality silver ] .
EXB	John	2	15	Jesus made a whip out of cords and forced all of them , ·both [ with ] the sheep and cattle , to leave the Temple . He turned over the tables and scattered the money of ·those who were exchanging it [ L the moneychangers ] .
EXB	John	2	16	Then he said to those who were selling ·doves [ or pigeons ] , “ Take these things out of here ! Don ’ t make my Father ’ s house [ C the Temple was God ’ s home on earth ;
EXB	John	2	1	Kin .
EXB	John	2	17	When this happened , the ·followers [ disciples ] remembered what was written [ C in the Scriptures ] : · “ My strong love for your Temple completely controls me [ L “ Zeal for your house will consume me ” ; Ps . 69:9 ] . ”
EXB	John	2	18	Some of ·his people [ L the Jews ] ·said to [ responded to ; demanded of ] Jesus , “ Show us a ·miracle [ L sign ] to ·prove you have the right to do these things [ justify your actions ] . ”
EXB	John	2	19	Jesus ·answered [ replied to ] them , “ Destroy this temple , and I will ·build [ L raise ] it again in three days [ C an allusion to his resurrection ; 2:22 ; Matt . 26:61 ; 27:40 ] . ”
EXB	John	2	20	bc , thus dating this statement to about ad
EXB	John	2	27	] to ·build [ reconstruct ] this Temple ! Do you really believe you can ·build [ raise ] it again in three days ? ”
EXB	John	2	21	( But the temple Jesus meant was his own body [ C Jesus was claiming divinity , his body corresponding with the Temple , the home/dwelling place of God ; 1:14 ] .
EXB	John	2	22	After Jesus was raised from the dead , his ·followers [ disciples ] remembered that Jesus had said this . Then they believed the Scripture [ compare Ps . 16:10 ] and the words Jesus had said . )
EXB	John	2	23	When Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast [ see 2:13 ] , many people ·believed [ put their faith ; trusted ] in ·him [ L his name ] because they saw the ·miracles [ L signs ; 2:11 ] he did [ 4:48 ; Mark 8:11–13 ] .
EXB	John	2	24	But Jesus did not ·believe in [ entrust/commit himself to ] them because he knew them all .
EXB	John	2	25	He did not need anyone to ·tell [ testify/witness to ] him about ·people [ human nature ] , because he knew what was in ·people ’ s minds [ people ’ s hearts ; L people ] .
EXB	John	3	3	Jesus answered , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , unless you are born ·again [ or from above ; C this may be a play on words , meaning both “ again ” and “ from above ” ] , you can not ·be in [ experience ; L see ] God ’ s kingdom. ”
EXB	John	3	2	·One night [ or By night ; C perhaps with connotations that he could not “ see ” spiritually ] Nicodemus came to Jesus and said , “ ·Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , we know you are a teacher sent from God , because no one can do the ·miracles [ L signs ; 2:11 ] you do unless God is with him. ”
EXB	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to him , “ But if a person is already old , how can he be born ·again [ or from above ; 3:3 ] ? ·He can not enter his mother ’ s womb again . So how can a person be born a second time [ L Can he enter his mother ’ s womb a second time and be born ] ? ”
EXB	John	3	5	But Jesus answered , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , unless you are born from water and the Spirit [ C equivalent to being born again ( 3:3 ) ; water could symbolize physical birth , but more likely symbolizes spiritual cleansing which brings renewal ; Ezek . 36:25–27 ] , you can not enter God ’ s kingdom .
EXB	John	3	6	·Human life comes from human parents [ L That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; C flesh here means human nature ] , but ·spiritual life comes from the Spirit [ L that which is born of the Spirit is spirit ] .
EXB	John	3	7	Don ’ t be ·surprised [ amazed ; astonished ] when I tell you , ‘ You [ C plural , referring to the Jews or the Jewish leaders ] must be born ·again [ or from above ; 3:3 ] . ’
EXB	John	3	8	The wind [ C one word means both “ wind ” and “ spirit ” in Greek ] blows where it wants to and you hear the sound of it , but you don ’ t know where the wind comes from or where it is going . It is the same with every person who is born from the Spirit. ” [ C We can not comprehend or control the Spirit , but we experience his effect . ]
EXB	John	3	9	Nicodemus ·asked [ replied ] , “ How can this ·happen [ be ] ? ”
EXB	John	3	10	Jesus ·said [ replied ; answered ] , “ You are ·an important teacher in Israel [ L the teacher of Israel ] , and you don ’ t ·understand [ know ] these things ?
EXB	John	3	11	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , we talk about what we know , and we ·tell [ testify ; bear witness ] about what we have seen , but you don ’ t ·accept what we tell you [ L receive our testimony/witness ] .
EXB	John	3	12	I have told you about things here on earth [ C the teaching about being born again ] , and you do not believe me . ·So you will not [ L So how will you… ? ] believe me if I tell you about things of heaven .
EXB	John	3	13	·The only one who has ever gone up to heaven is [ L No one has gone up into heaven except ] the One who came down from heaven—the Son of Man [ a ] [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] .
EXB	John	3	14	“ Just as Moses lifted up the ·snake [ T serpent ] in the ·desert [ wilderness ; C Moses put a bronze snake statue on a pole , and those who looked at it were healed of snake bites ; Num . 21:4–9 ] , the Son of Man must also be lifted up [ C an allusion to the cross and resurrection ] .
EXB	John	3	15	So that everyone who ·believes can have eternal life in him [ or believes in him can have eternal life ] .
EXB	John	3	16	“ [ L For ] God loved the world so much that he gave his ·one and only [ only ; unique ; T only begotten ; 1:14 ,
EXB	John	3	18	People who believe in God ’ s Son are not ·judged guilty [ condemned ] . Those who do not believe have already been ·judged guilty [ condemned ] , because they have not believed in [ L the name of ] God ’ s ·one and only [ only ; unique ; T only begotten ; 3:16 ] Son .
EXB	John	3	17	[ L For ; Indeed ] God did not send his Son into the world to ·judge the world guilty [ condemn the world ] , but to save the world through him .
EXB	John	3	19	·They are judged by this fact [ L And this is the judgment/condemnation/verdict ] : The Light [ C Jesus , God ’ s Son ] has come into the world , ·but they did not want light . They wanted darkness [ L but people loved the darkness more than the light ] , because they were doing evil things .
EXB	John	3	20	All who do evil hate the light and will not come to the light , because it will show ·all the evil things they do [ L their deeds/actions ] .
EXB	John	3	21	But those who ·follow the true way [ do what is true ; live by the truth ] come to the light , and it ·shows [ may be seen ] that the things they do were done ·through [ or in the sight of ; or in obedience to ; L in ] God. ” Jesus and John the Baptist
EXB	John	3	22	After this , Jesus and his ·followers [ disciples ] went into the ·area [ countryside ] of Judea , where he ·stayed [ spent time ] with his ·followers [ disciples ] and baptized people .
EXB	John	3	23	John was also baptizing in Aenon [ C a town ( meaning “ springs ” ) of uncertain location on the Jordan River ( but see note on Salim ) ] , near Salim [ C a town ( meaning “ peace ” ) probably located either near Shechem or just south of Bethshan , both of which are in a Samaritan area ] , because there was plenty of water there . People were going there to be baptized .
EXB	John	3	24	( This was before John was put into prison [ Matt . 4:12 ] . )
EXB	John	3	25	Some of John ’ s ·followers [ disciples ] had an ·argument [ discussion ; debate ] with a Jew about ·religious washing [ ceremonial cleansing ; L purification ; C the Jewish people washed themselves for ritual purposes before eating , before worshiping in the Temple , and at other special times ] .
EXB	John	3	26	So they came to John and said , “ Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River , the one ·you spoke about so much [ L about whom you have testified/witnessed ] ? He is baptizing , and everyone is going to him. ”
EXB	John	3	27	John answered , “ A ·man [ person ] can get only what ·God gives him [ L is given to him from heaven ] .
EXB	John	3	28	You yourselves heard me ·say [ testify ] , ‘ I am not the ·Christ [ Messiah ] , but I am the one sent ·to prepare the way for him [ L before him ; 1:20–28 ; compare Is . 40:3 ] . ’
EXB	John	3	29	The bride belongs only to the bridegroom . But the ·friend who helps the bridegroom [ or the best man ] stands by and listens to him . He ·is thrilled [ rejoices greatly ] that he gets to hear the bridegroom ’ s voice . In the same way , ·I am really happy [ L my joy is fulfilled ; C in this analogy , John is the best man and Jesus is the bridegroom ] .
EXB	John	3	30	He must ·become greater [ increase ] , and I must ·become less important [ decrease ] . The One Who Comes from Heaven
EXB	John	3	31	“ The One [ C Jesus ] who comes from above is ·greater than [ L above ] all . The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about ·things on the earth [ earthly matters ] . But the One who comes from heaven is ·greater than [ L above ] all .
EXB	John	3	32	He ·tells [ testifies to ; bears witness to ] what he has seen and heard , but no one ·accepts [ receives ] ·what he says [ his testimony ; 3:11 ] .
EXB	John	3	33	Whoever ·accepts what he says [ receives his testimony ] has ·proven [ certified ; affirmed ; L set his seal ] that God is true .
EXB	John	3	34	[ L For ] The One whom God sent speaks the words of God , because God gives him the Spirit ·fully [ L without measure/limit ] .
EXB	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given ·him power over everything [ him authority over all ; L all things into his hand ] .
EXB	John	3	36	Those who believe in the Son have eternal life , but those who ·do not obey [ reject ] the Son will ·never have [ L not see ] life . God ’ s ·anger [ wrath ] ·stays [ remains ] on them. ” Footnotes - John 3:13 the Son of Man Some Greek copies continue , “ who is in heaven . ”
EXB	John	4	4	But on the way he had to go through the country of Samaria [ C the central region occupied by a people disliked because they were only partly Jewish ] .
EXB	John	4	2	although Jesus himself did not baptize people , but his ·followers [ disciples ] did .
EXB	John	4	3	Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard about him , so he left Judea [ C the southern region of Israel ] and went back to Galilee [ C the northern region of Israel ; Mark 1:14 ] .
EXB	John	4	5	In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar [ C perhaps Shechem or a village near it ; compare Gen. 33:18–19 ; 48:22 ] , which is near the ·field [ plot of ground ] Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
EXB	John	4	6	AM ] the fever left him. ”
EXB	John	4	7	When a Samaritan woman came to the well to ·get some [ draw ] water , Jesus said to her , “ ·Please give [ L Give ] me a drink. ”
EXB	John	4	8	( This happened while Jesus ’ ·followers [ disciples ] were in town buying some food . )
EXB	John	4	9	The Samaritan woman said , “ ·I am surprised [ L How is it… ? ] that you ask me for a drink , since you are a ·Jewish man [ L a Jew ] and I am a Samaritan woman. ” ( Jewish people ·are not friends [ do not share things ; have no dealings ] with Samaritans . )
EXB	John	4	10	Jesus ·said [ answered ; replied ] , “ If you only knew the ·free gift [ L gift ] of God and who it is that is asking you ·for water [ L “ Give me a drink ” ] , you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water. ” [ C “ Living water ” in Greek can mean fresh running water , but Jesus means “ water which gives eternal life ” ; the woman misunderstands this play on words . ]
EXB	John	4	11	The woman said , “ Sir , where will you get this living water ? The well is very deep , and you have ·nothing to get water with [ L no bucket ] .
EXB	John	4	12	Are you greater than Jacob , our father [ C a patriarch recognized by both Jews and Samaritans ] , who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and ·flocks [ or livestock ] ? ”
EXB	John	4	13	Jesus answered , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again [ C because physical water only temporarily satisfies thirst ] ,
EXB	John	4	14	but whoever drinks the water I give will never be thirsty [ C because spiritual renewal/eternal life is forever ] . [ L But ; Indeed ] The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person , giving eternal life [ Is . 12:3 ; 49:10 ; 55:1–3 ; Rev . 7:16 ] . ”
EXB	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to ·get [ draw ] more water. ” [ C Her response indicates she does not understand . ]
EXB	John	4	16	Jesus told her , “ Go ·get [ call ] your husband and come back here. ”
EXB	John	4	17	The woman answered , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right to say you have no husband .
EXB	John	4	18	·Really [ For ] you have had five husbands , and the man you ·live with [ L have ] now is not your husband . You told the truth. ”
EXB	John	4	19	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet .
EXB	John	4	20	Our ·ancestors [ forefathers ; L fathers ] worshiped on this mountain [ C the Samaritans worshiped on Mount Gerizim near Shechem ] , but you [ C plural , referring to the Jews ] say that Jerusalem [ C Mount Zion , the location of the temple ] is the place where people must worship. ”
EXB	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , “ Believe me , woman [ C a respectful form of address in that culture ; 2:4 ] . The ·time [ L hour ; C the time of salvation established by the death and resurrection of Christ ; see 2:4 ] is coming when neither in Jerusalem nor on this mountain will you ·actually worship [ L worship ] the Father .
EXB	John	4	22	You Samaritans worship something you don ’ t understand . We [ C Jews ] understand what we worship , because salvation comes from the Jews [ C because the Messiah who brings salvation comes through the Jews ] .
EXB	John	4	23	[ L But ] The ·time [ L hour ; see 4:21 ] is coming when the true worshipers will worship the Father in ·spirit [ or the Spirit ] and truth , and that time ·is here already [ has now come ; is now here ] . You see , the Father too is actively seeking such people to worship him .
EXB	John	4	24	God is ·spirit [ Spirit ] , and those who worship him must worship in ·spirit [ Spirit ] and truth. ”
EXB	John	4	25	The woman said to him , “ I know that the Messiah is coming. ” ( Messiah is the One called Christ [ C both Hebrew Mashiach and Greek Christos mean “ Anointed One ” ; see 1:41 ] . ) “ When ·the Messiah [ L that one ] comes , he will ·explain [ report ; announce ] everything to us. ”
EXB	John	4	26	Then Jesus said to her , “ I am he—I , the one talking to you. ”
EXB	John	4	27	Just then his ·followers [ disciples ] came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman [ C some Jews thought it a waste of time for rabbis to teach women ] . But none of them asked , “ What do you want ? ” or “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
EXB	John	4	28	Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town . She said to the people ,
EXB	John	4	29	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did . Do you think he might be the ·Christ [ Messiah ] ? ”
EXB	John	4	30	So the people left the town and ·went to see Jesus [ L were coming toward him ] .
EXB	John	4	31	Meanwhile , his ·followers [ disciples ] were ·begging [ urging ] him , “ ·Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , eat something. ”
EXB	John	4	32	But Jesus answered , “ I have food to eat that you know nothing about [ Deut . 8:3 ] . ”
EXB	John	4	33	So the ·followers [ disciples ] asked ·themselves [ each other ] , “ ·Did somebody already bring him food [ L No one brought him anything to eat , did they ] ? ”
EXB	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , “ My food is to do ·what the One who sent me wants me to do [ L the will of the One who sent me ] and to ·finish [ complete ] his work .
EXB	John	4	35	·You have a saying [ L Do you not say… ? ] , ‘ Four more months till harvest. ’ ·But [ Look ; T Behold ] I tell you , ·open your eyes and look at [ L lift up your eyes and see ] the fields ·ready [ ripe ; L white ] for harvest now .
EXB	John	4	36	Already , the one who ·harvests [ reaps ] is ·being paid [ L receiving wages ] and is gathering ·crops [ fruit ] for eternal life . So the one who ·plants [ sows ] and the one who ·harvests [ reaps ] ·celebrate [ rejoice ] ·at the same time [ together ] .
EXB	John	4	37	[ L For ] ·Here [ in this case ] the saying is true , ‘ One person ·plants [ sows ] , and another ·harvests [ reaps ] . ’
EXB	John	4	38	I sent you to ·harvest a crop that [ reap what ] you did not ·work [ labor ; toil ] on . Others did the ·work [ labor ; toil ] , and you ·get to finish up [ reap the benefits of ; L have entered into ] their work. ”
EXB	John	4	39	Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because of ·what the woman said [ L the word of the woman who testified ] : “ He told me everything I ever did. ”
EXB	John	4	40	When the Samaritans came to Jesus , they ·begged [ urged ; asked ] him to stay with them , so he stayed there two more days .
EXB	John	4	41	And many more believed because of ·the things he said [ L his word ] .
EXB	John	4	42	They said to the woman , “ ·First we believed in Jesus [ L It is no longer ] because of what you said , but now we believe because we heard him ourselves . We know that this man really is the Savior of the world. ” Jesus Heals an Officer ’ s Son ( A )
EXB	John	4	43	Two days later , Jesus left [ L from there ] and went to Galilee [ C the northern region of Israel ] .
EXB	John	4	44	( Jesus had ·said [ testified ; witnessed ] before that a prophet ·is not respected [ L has no honor ] in his own ·country [ or hometown ; C probably a reference to Galilee , but some think Judea ] . )
EXB	John	4	45	When [ L therefore ] Jesus arrived in Galilee , the ·people there [ L Galileans ] ·welcomed [ received ] him . They had seen all the things he did at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem , because they had been there , too .
EXB	John	4	46	Jesus went again to visit Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine [ 2:1–11 ] . One of the king ’ s important officers lived in the city of Capernaum , and his son was sick .
EXB	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to Jesus and ·begged [ urged ; asked ] him to come to Capernaum and heal his son , because his son was almost dead .
EXB	John	4	48	Jesus said to him , “ ·You people must see signs and miracles before you will believe in me [ L Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe ; 2:23–25 ; 6:26 ] . ”
EXB	John	4	49	The [ royal ] officer said , “ Sir , ·come [ L come down ] before my child dies. ”
EXB	John	4	50	Jesus ·answered [ said to him ] , “ Go . Your son will live. ” The man believed what Jesus told him [ C he did not need “ signs ” and miracles ] and went home .
EXB	John	4	51	On the way the man ’ s ·servants [ slaves ; bond-servants ] came and met him and told him , “ Your son is alive. ”
EXB	John	4	52	[ L So/Then ] The man asked , “ What ·time [ hour ] did my son begin to get well ? ” They answered , “ Yesterday at ·one o ’ clock [ L the seventh hour ; C hours were counted from dawn , about
EXB	John	4	53	[ L So/Then ] The father knew that ·one o ’ clock was the exact time that [ L in that hour ] Jesus had said , “ Your son will live. ” So the man and all ·the people who lived in his house [ his household ] believed in Jesus .
EXB	John	4	54	That was the second ·miracle [ L sign ; C the first sign was turning water into wine ; 2:1–11 ] Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee .
EXB	John	5	5	A man was lying there who had been ·sick [ an invalid ; disabled ] for thirty-eight years .
EXB	John	5	2	In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches , which is called Bethesda [ a ] [ C a pool of water north of the temple thought to have curative powers ] in the Hebrew language [ C referring to Aramaic , the native language of the Jews at the time ] . This pool is near the Sheep Gate .
EXB	John	5	3	Many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool . Some were blind , some were crippled , and some were paralyzed | , and they waited for the water to move .
EXB	John	5	4	·Sometimes [ At a certain time ; From time to time ] an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and stirred up the water . After the angel did this , the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had| [ b ] .
EXB	John	5	6	When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been ·sick [ an invalid ; disabled ] for such a long time , Jesus asked him , “ Do you want to be well ? ”
EXB	John	5	7	The ·sick man [ invalid ] answered [ him ] , “ Sir , there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water ·starts moving [ is stirred up ] . While I am coming to the water , someone else always ·gets in [ goes down ] before me. ”
EXB	John	5	8	Then Jesus said to him , “ ·Stand up [ T Rise ] . Pick up your ·mat [ bed ; cot ] and walk. ”
EXB	John	5	9	And immediately the man ·was well [ was healed ; became whole ] ; he picked up his ·mat [ bed ; cot ] and began to walk . The day this happened was a Sabbath day .
EXB	John	5	10	So the ·Jews [ or Jewish leaders ] said to the man who had been healed , “ Today is the Sabbath . It is ·against our law [ L not lawful/permitted ] for you to carry your ·mat [ bed ; cot ] on the Sabbath day [ C the fourth commandment prohibited work on the Sabbath , but not specifically this action ( Ex . 20:8–11 ) ] . ”
EXB	John	5	11	But he answered them , “ The man who made me well told me , ‘ Pick up your ·mat [ bed ; cot ] and walk. ’ ”
EXB	John	5	12	Then they asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to pick up your ·mat [ bed ; cot ] and walk ? ”
EXB	John	5	13	But the man who had been healed did not know who it was , because there were many people in that place , and Jesus had ·left [ withdrawn ; slipped away unnoticed ] .
EXB	John	5	14	Later , Jesus found the man at the Temple [ area ] and said to him , “ See , you are well now . ·Stop sinning [ T Sin no more ] so that something worse does not happen to you. ” [ C Sometimes , not always , suffering can be explained by sin . ]
EXB	John	5	15	Then the man left and told ·his people [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] that Jesus was the one who had made him well .
EXB	John	5	16	Because Jesus was doing ·this [ L these things ] on the Sabbath day , ·some evil people [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] began to ·persecute [ harass ] him .
EXB	John	5	17	But Jesus ·said to [ L answered ] them , “ My Father ·never stops [ is always ; is still ] working [ C even on the Sabbath ] , and so I keep working , too. ”
EXB	John	5	18	This made ·them [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] try still harder to kill him . They said , “ First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day . Now he says that God is his own Father , making himself equal with God ! ” [ C Both breaking the Sabbath and blasphemy against God were punishable by death ; Ex . 35:2 ; Lev . 24:16 . ] Jesus Has God ’ s Authority
EXB	John	5	19	But Jesus ·said [ answered them ] , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , the Son can do nothing ·alone [ on his own initiative ; by himself ] . The Son does only what he sees the Father doing , ·because the Son does whatever the Father does [ L for whatever the Father does , the Son does likewise ] .
EXB	John	5	20	[ L For ] The Father loves the Son and shows the Son all the things he himself does . But the Father will show the Son even greater things than this so that you can all ·be amazed [ marvel ; be astonished ] .
EXB	John	5	21	[ L For ] Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so also the Son gives life to those he ·wants to [ wishes ; wills ] .
EXB	John	5	22	·In fact , [ or For ] the Father judges no one , but he has ·given [ entrusted to ] the Son ·power to do all the judging [ L all judgment ; Rev . 20:11–15 ]
EXB	John	5	23	so that all people will honor the Son as much as they honor the Father . Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
EXB	John	5	24	“ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , whoever ·hears [ obeys ] ·what I say [ L my word/message ] and believes in the One who sent me has eternal life . That person will not ·be judged guilty [ L come into judgment/condemnation ] but has ·already left death and entered life [ L passed from death into life ] .
EXB	John	5	25	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , the ·time [ L hour ] is coming and is already here when the dead will ·hear [ obey ] the voice of the Son of God , and those who ·hear [ obey ] will ·have life [ live ] .
EXB	John	5	26	[ L For ] ·Life comes from the Father himself [ just as the Father has life ] , ·and [ so ] he has ·allowed the Son to have [ given the Son ] life in himself as well .
EXB	John	5	27	And the Father has given the Son the ·approval [ authority ; power ; right ] to ·judge [ execute judgment ] , because he is the Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] .
EXB	John	5	28	Don ’ t ·be surprised [ marvel ; be amazed ] at this : A ·time [ L hour ] is coming when all who are dead and in their graves will hear his voice .
EXB	John	5	29	Then they will come out of their graves . Those who did good ·will rise and have life forever [ L to the resurrection resulting in life ] , but those who did evil ·will rise to be judged guilty [ L to the resurrection resulting in condemnation/judgment ] . Jesus Is God ’ s Son
EXB	John	5	30	“ I can do nothing ·alone [ by myself ; on my own initiative ] . I judge ·only the way I am told [ L as I hear ] , so my judgment is ·fair [ just ; right ; righteous ] . I don ’ t ·try to please myself [ L seek my own will/desire ] , but ·I try to please [ L the will of ] the One who sent me .
EXB	John	5	31	“ If only I ·tell people [ testify ; witness ] about myself , ·what I say [ my testimony ; witness ] is not ·true [ valid ] .
EXB	John	5	32	But there is another who ·tells [ testifies ; witnesses ] about me , and I know that ·the things he says [ L the witness/testimony he witnesses/testifies ] about me are ·true [ valid ] .
EXB	John	5	33	“ You have sent people to John , and he has ·told you [ testified/witnessed to ] the truth .
EXB	John	5	34	It is not that I ·need [ accept ; depend on ] ·what humans say [ human testimony/witness ] ; I tell you this so you can be saved .
EXB	John	5	35	John was like a burning and shining lamp , and you were ·happy to enjoy [ L willing to rejoice in ] his light for a while .
EXB	John	5	36	“ But I have a ·proof [ testimony ; witness ] about myself that is ·greater [ weightier ] than that of John . [ L For ] The ·things [ L works ] I do , which are the ·things [ L works ] my Father gave me to ·do [ complete ; finish ; C the signs and miracles which point to his saving work on the cross ] , ·prove [ testify ; witness ] that the Father sent me .
EXB	John	5	37	And the Father himself who sent me has given ·proof [ testimony ; witness ] ·about me [ concerning me ; on my behalf ] . You have never heard his voice or seen ·what he looks like [ his form ; his outward appearance ] .
EXB	John	5	38	His ·teaching [ word ; message ] does not ·live [ remain ; abide ] in you , because you don ’ t believe in the One the Father sent .
EXB	John	5	39	You ·carefully study [ search ; examine ] the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life . They do in fact ·tell [ testify ; witness ] ·about me [ concerning me ; on my behalf ] ,
EXB	John	5	40	but you ·refuse [ do not want ] to come to me to have that life .
EXB	John	5	41	“ I don ’ t ·need [ or accept ; receive ] ·praise [ glory ; honor ] from people .
EXB	John	5	42	But I know you—I know that you don ’ t have God ’ s love in you .
EXB	John	5	43	I have come ·from my Father and speak for him [ L in my Father ’ s name ] , ·but [ or and ] you don ’ t ·accept [ receive ] me . But when another person comes , ·speaking only for himself [ L in his own name ] , you will ·accept [ receive ] him .
EXB	John	5	44	You try to ·get praise [ receive glory/honor ] from each other , but you do not try to ·get the praise [ receive glory/honor ] that comes from the only God . So how can you believe ?
EXB	John	5	45	Don ’ t think that I will ·stand before the Father and say you are wrong [ L accuse you before the Father ] . The one who ·says you are wrong [ L accuses you ] is Moses , the one ·you hoped would save you [ L in whom you hoped ] .
EXB	John	5	46	[ L For ] If you really believed Moses , you would believe me , because Moses wrote about me [ C in the Torah , the first five books of the OT ; for example , Deut . 18:15 quoted in Acts 3:22 ] .
EXB	John	5	47	But if you don ’ t believe what Moses wrote , how can you believe what I say ? ”
EXB	John	6	6	( Jesus asked Philip this question to test him , because Jesus already knew what he ·planned [ was going ] to do . )
EXB	John	6	2	Kin . 4:42–44 ; C Jesus ’ miracle surpasses that of Elisha ] .
EXB	John	6	3	Jesus went up on a ·hill [ or mountain ] and sat down there with his ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	John	6	4	It was almost the time for the Jewish Passover Feast [ C the annual festival that celebrates God ’ s rescue of Israel from Egypt ; Ex .
EXB	John	6	12	When they ·had all had enough to eat [ L were filled/satisfied ] , Jesus said to his ·followers [ disciples ] , “ Gather the leftover ·pieces of fish and bread [ L pieces ] so that nothing is wasted. ”
EXB	John	6	5	When Jesus ·looked up [ L raised his eyes ] and saw a large crowd coming toward him , he said to Philip [ C one of the twelve disciples ; 1:43 ] , “ Where can we buy enough bread for all these people to eat ? ”
EXB	John	6	7	Philip answered [ L him ] , “ ·Someone would have to work almost a year to buy enough bread [ L Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not enough ; C a denarius was a unit of money worth about a day ’ s wages ] for each person to have only a little piece. ”
EXB	John	6	8	Another one of his ·followers [ disciples ] , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , said to him ,
EXB	John	6	9	“ Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish , but ·that is not enough [ L what are these… ? ] for so many people. ”
EXB	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ ·Tell [ L Make ] the people to sit down. ” There was plenty of grass there , and about five thousand men sat down there .
EXB	John	6	11	Then Jesus took the loaves of bread , ·thanked God [ L gave thanks ] for them , and ·gave [ distributed ] them to the people who were sitting there . He did the same with the fish , giving as much as the people wanted .
EXB	John	6	13	So they gathered up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left from the five barley loaves [
EXB	John	6	14	When the people saw this ·miracle [ L sign ] that Jesus did , they said , “ He must truly be the Prophet [ 1:21 ; C probably the “ prophet like Moses ” of Deut . 18:15–18 ] who is coming into the world. ”
EXB	John	6	15	Jesus knew that the people ·planned [ intended ; were about ] to come and take him by force and make him their king , so he ·left [ withdrew ] and went into the ·hills [ or mountains ] alone . Jesus Walks on the Water ( B )
EXB	John	6	16	That evening Jesus ’ ·followers [ disciples ] went down to ·Lake Galilee [ L the lake/sea ] .
EXB	John	6	17	It was dark now , and Jesus had not yet ·come to [ joined ] them . The ·followers [ disciples ] got into a boat and started across the lake to Capernaum .
EXB	John	6	18	By now a strong wind was blowing , and ·the waves on the lake were getting bigger [ L the sea/lake rose up ] .
EXB	John	6	19	When they had rowed the boat about ·three or four miles [ L twenty-five or thirty stadia ; C a stadion was about
EXB	John	6	600	feet ] , they saw Jesus walking on the ·water [ sea ; lake ] , coming toward the boat . The ·followers [ disciples ] were afraid ,
EXB	John	6	20	but Jesus said to them , “ It is I [ or “ I am ” ; C there could be an echo here of Ex . 3:14 ] . Do not be afraid. ”
EXB	John	6	21	Then they ·were glad [ or were willing ] to take him into the boat . ·At once [ Immediately ] the boat came to land at the place where they wanted to go . [ C The sea often stands for chaos , and God controls it . ] The People Seek Jesus
EXB	John	6	22	The next day the ·people [ L crowd ] who had stayed on the ·other [ opposite ] side of the ·lake [ sea ] knew that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his ·followers [ disciples ] but that they had left ·without him [ L alone ] . And they ·knew [ L saw ] that only one boat had been there .
EXB	John	6	23	But then some boats came from Tiberias [ C a major city on the western shore of Lake Galilee ] and landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
EXB	John	6	24	When the ·people [ L crowd ] saw that Jesus and his ·followers [ disciples ] were not there now , they got into boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus . Jesus , the Bread of Life
EXB	John	6	25	When ·the people [ L they ] found Jesus on the ·other [ opposite ] side of the ·lake [ sea ] , they asked him , “ ·Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , when did you come here ? ”
EXB	John	6	26	Jesus answered , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , you aren ’ t looking for me because you saw ·me do miracles [ L signs ] . You are looking for me because you ate the bread and were ·satisfied [ filled ] .
EXB	John	6	27	Don ’ t work for the food that ·spoils [ perishes ] . Work for the food that ·stays good always and gives eternal life [ L endures/remains/abides for eternal life ] . The Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] will give you this food , because on him God the Father has ·put his power [ L set his seal ; C a seal impression signifies ownership and authority ; 3:33 ] . ”
EXB	John	6	28	The people asked Jesus , “ What ·are the things God wants us to do [ L should we do to work the works of God ] ? ”
EXB	John	6	29	Jesus answered , “ ·The work God wants you to do is this [ L This is the work of God ] : Believe the One he sent. ”
EXB	John	6	30	So ·the people [ L they ] asked , “ What ·miracle will you do ? If we see a miracle , we will believe you [ L sign will you do that we might see and believe you ? ] . What ·will you do [ work will you perform ] ?
EXB	John	6	31	Our ·ancestors [ forefathers ; L fathers ] ate the manna [ C a flaky breadlike food that God provided the Israelites in the wilderness ; Ex . 16:13–36 ] in the ·desert [ wilderness ] . ·This is written in the Scriptures [ L As it is written ] : ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat [ compare Ex . 16:4 ; Neh . 9:15 ; Ps . 78:24 ] . ’
EXB	John	6	32	[ L Therefore ; So ; Then ] Jesus said to them , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , it was not Moses who gave you bread from heaven ; it is my Father who is giving you the true bread from heaven .
EXB	John	6	33	[ L For ] God ’ s bread is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
EXB	John	6	34	[ L Therefore ] ·the people [ L they ] said to him , “ Sir , give us this bread always. ”
EXB	John	6	35	Then Jesus said to them , “ I am the ·bread that gives life [ T bread of life ] . Whoever comes to me will never be hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
EXB	John	6	36	But as I told you before , you have seen me and still don ’ t believe .
EXB	John	6	37	·The Father gives me the people who are mine . Every one of them will come to me [ L All/Everything the Father gives me will come to me ] , and I will ·always accept them [ not reject them ; L not cast them out ] .
EXB	John	6	38	[ L For ] I came down from heaven to do ·what God wants me to do [ L the will of him who sent me ] , not ·what I want to do [ L my own will ] .
EXB	John	6	39	Here is ·what the One who sent me wants me to do [ L the will of him who sent me ] : I must not lose even one whom God gave me , but I must raise them all on the last day .
EXB	John	6	40	Those who see the Son and believe in him have eternal life , and I will raise them on the last day . This is ·what my Father wants [ L the will of my Father ] . ”
EXB	John	6	41	·Some people [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] began to ·complain [ grumble ; murmur ] about Jesus because he said , “ I am the bread that comes down from heaven. ”
EXB	John	6	42	They said , “ ·This is [ L Is this not… ? ] Jesus , the son of Joseph . We know his father and mother . How can he [ L now ] say , ‘ I came down from heaven ’ ? ”
EXB	John	6	43	But Jesus ·answered [ responded ] , “ Stop ·complaining to each other [ grumbling/murmuring among yourselves ] .
EXB	John	6	44	The Father is the One who sent me . No one can come to me unless the Father draws him to me , and I will raise that person up on the last day .
EXB	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , ‘ They will all be taught by God [ Is . 54:13 ] . ’ Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me .
EXB	John	6	46	·No one has [ or Not that anyone has ] seen the Father except the One who is from God ; only he has seen the Father . [ C Some interpreters put the previous sentence in parentheses as a side comment made by the author . ]
EXB	John	6	47	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , whoever believes has eternal life .
EXB	John	6	48	I am the ·bread that gives life [ T bread of life ] .
EXB	John	6	49	Your ·ancestors [ forefathers ; L fathers ] ate the manna [ see 6:31 ] in the ·desert [ wilderness ] , but still they died .
EXB	John	6	50	Here is the bread that comes down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will never die .
EXB	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Anyone who eats this bread will live forever . This bread is my flesh , which I will give up so that the world may have life. ”
EXB	John	6	52	Then the ·Jewish leaders [ L Jews ] began to ·argue [ dispute ; quarrel ] among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
EXB	John	6	53	[ L So ] Jesus said to them , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , you must eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood . Otherwise , you won ’ t have ·real life [ L life ] in you .
EXB	John	6	54	Those who ·eat [ feed on ; C Jesus uses a different Greek word for “ eat ” in vv . 54–57 than in the previous verses ; but the difference is probably stylistic ] my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life , and I will raise them up on the last day .
EXB	John	6	55	[ L For ] My flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
EXB	John	6	56	Those who ·eat [ feed on ] my flesh and drink my blood ·live [ remain ; abide ] in me , and I ·live [ remain ; abide ] in them .
EXB	John	6	57	The living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father . So whoever ·eats [ feeds on ] me will live because of me .
EXB	John	6	58	I am not like the bread your ·ancestors [ forefathers ; L fathers ] ate [ C the manna ; 6:31 ] . They ate that bread and still died . I am the bread that came down from heaven , and whoever ·eats [ feeds on ] this bread will live forever. ”
EXB	John	6	59	Jesus said all these things while he was teaching in the synagogue [ C a local congregation of Jews ] in Capernaum [ 2:12 ] . The Words of Eternal Life
EXB	John	6	60	When the ·followers [ disciples ; C a broader circle of followers , not the twelve disciples ] of Jesus heard this , many of them said , “ This teaching [ C that Jesus is the bread of life ; 6:25–59 ] is ·hard [ difficult ; offensive ] . Who can ·accept [ obey ; L hear ] it ? ”
EXB	John	6	61	Knowing that his ·followers [ disciples ] were ·complaining [ grumbling ] about this , Jesus said to them , “ Does this teaching ·bother [ offend ] you ?
EXB	John	6	62	Then ·will it also bother you to [ L what if you ] see the Son of Man ·going back [ L going up ; ascending ] to the place ·where he came from [ L where he was before ; C heaven ] ?
EXB	John	6	63	It is the Spirit that gives life . The flesh ·doesn ’ t give life [ L is useless ; counts for nothing ] . The words I told you ·are spirit , and they give life [ or are from the Spirit who gives life ] .
EXB	John	6	64	But some of you don ’ t believe. ” ( [ L For ] Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would ·turn against [ betray ] him . )
EXB	John	6	65	Jesus said , “ That is the reason I said , · ‘ If the Father does not bring a person to me , that one can not come. ’ [ L ‘ No one can come to me unless the Father enables/grants him. ’ ] ”
EXB	John	6	66	After Jesus said this , many of his ·followers [ disciples ] ·left him [ L turned back to previous things ] and ·stopped following [ L no longer walked with ] him .
EXB	John	6	67	Jesus asked ·the twelve followers [ the Twelve ] , “ Do you want to leave , too ? ”
EXB	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord [ or Master ] , who would we go to ? You have the words that give eternal life .
EXB	John	6	69	We believe and know that you are the Holy One from God. ”
EXB	John	6	70	Then Jesus answered them , “ ·I chose [ L Did I not choose… ? ] all twelve of you , but one of you is ·a devil [ or the Devil ; C Jesus equates the work of Judas with the work of Satan ; compare Mark 8:33 ] . ”
EXB	John	6	71	Jesus was talking about Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Judas was one of the twelve , but later he was going to ·turn against [ betray ] Jesus .
EXB	John	7	7	The world can not hate you [ C because they are part of it ] , but it hates me , because I ·tell it [ testify concerning ; witness to ] ·the evil things it does [ L that its works are evil ] .
EXB	John	7	2	Sam . 7:12–16 ; Ps . 89:3–4 ; Is . 9:7 ; 55:3 ] and from Bethlehem , the ·town [ village ] where David lived [ Mic . 5:2 ] . ”
EXB	John	7	3	So Jesus ’ brothers [ C children of Joseph and Mary born after Jesus , or children of Joseph from a previous marriage ; Mark 3:21 , 31–35 ] said to him , “ You should leave here and go to Judea so your ·followers [ disciples ] there can see the ·miracles [ L works ] you do .
EXB	John	7	4	[ L For ] Anyone who wants to be ·well [ publicly ] known does not ·hide what he does [ L act in secret ] . If you are doing these things , show yourself to the world. ”
EXB	John	7	5	( [ L For ] Even Jesus ’ brothers did not believe in him . )
EXB	John	7	6	[ L Therefore ] Jesus said to his brothers , “ ·The right time for me [ L My time ; 2:4 ] has not yet come , but any time is right for you [ C they could go to Jerusalem anytime ; but Jesus had a special destiny to fulfill there ] .
EXB	John	7	8	So you go [ L up ] to the feast . I will not go [ L up ] yet [ a ] to this feast , because ·the right time for me [ my time ] has not yet ·come [ fully come ; L been fulfilled ] . ”
EXB	John	7	9	After saying this , Jesus ·stayed [ remained behind ] in Galilee .
EXB	John	7	10	But after Jesus ’ brothers had gone [ L up ] to the feast , Jesus went [ L up ] also . But he did not ·let people see him [ L go publicly , but in secret ] .
EXB	John	7	11	At the feast ·some people [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] were ·looking for [ watching for ] him and saying , “ Where is that man ? ”
EXB	John	7	12	Within the large crowd there , many people were ·whispering [ arguing ; murmuring ; grumbling ] to each other about Jesus . Some said , “ He is a good man. ” Others said , “ No , he ·fools [ deceives ; misleads ] the people. ”
EXB	John	7	13	But no one was brave enough to talk about Jesus openly , because they were afraid of the ·elders [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] . Jesus Teaches at the Feast
EXB	John	7	14	When the feast was about half over , Jesus went to the Temple [ courts ; 2:14 ] and began to teach .
EXB	John	7	15	The people ·were amazed [ marveled ] and said , “ This man has never studied in school . How did he learn so much ? ”
EXB	John	7	16	Jesus answered them , “ The things I teach are not my own , but they come from him who sent me [ C God ] .
EXB	John	7	17	If people ·choose [ desire ; want ] to do ·what God wants [ L God ’ s will ] , they will know that my teaching comes from God and not from me .
EXB	John	7	18	Those who ·teach their own ideas [ speak with their own authority ] are trying to get ·honor [ glory ] for themselves . But those who try to bring ·honor [ glory ] to the one who sent them speak the truth , and there is nothing ·false [ or unrighteous ] in them . [ C The Greek here is singular ( “ But the one who… ” ) , so Jesus is speaking especially about himself . ]
EXB	John	7	19	Moses gave you the law [ L Has not Moses given you the law ? ; Ex . 34:29–32 ] , but none of you obeys that law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ”
EXB	John	7	20	The people answered , “ A demon has come into you [ L You have a demon ] . We are not trying to kill you [ L Who is trying to kill you ? ] . ”
EXB	John	7	21	Jesus ·said to [ answered ] them , “ I did one ·miracle [ L work ; deed ; 5:1–15 ] , and you are all ·amazed [ astonished ] .
EXB	John	7	22	Moses gave you the law about circumcision [ Ex . 12:44–49 ] . ( But really Moses did not give you circumcision ; it came from ·our ancestors [ L the fathers/patriarchs ; Gen . 17:9–14 ] . ) And yet you circumcise a ·baby boy [ L person ] on a Sabbath day .
EXB	John	7	23	If a ·baby boy [ L person ] can be circumcised on a Sabbath day ·to obey the law of Moses [ L so the law of Moses may not be broken ] , why are you angry at me for healing a person ’ s whole body on the Sabbath day ?
EXB	John	7	24	Stop judging by ·the way things look [ outward appearances ] , but judge by ·what is really right [ L right/just/righteous judgment ] . ” Is Jesus the Christ ?
EXB	John	7	25	Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said , “ ·This is the man [ L Isn ’ t this the man… ? ] they are trying to kill .
EXB	John	7	26	But he is ·teaching where everyone can see and hear him [ L speaking publicly ] , and no one is ·trying to stop [ L saying anything to ] him . Maybe the ·leaders [ rulers ; authorities ] have ·decided [ come to recognize ] he really is the ·Christ [ Messiah ] .
EXB	John	7	27	But we know where this man is from . Yet when the real ·Christ [ Messiah ] comes , no one will know where he comes from. ” [ C Some Jewish traditions claimed the Messiah would be unknown until he came to deliver Israel . ]
EXB	John	7	28	Jesus , teaching in the Temple [ courts ; 2:14 ] , cried out , “ Yes , you know me , and you know where I am from . But I have not come ·by my own authority [ on my own initiative ; L from myself ] . I was sent by the One who is true , whom you don ’ t know .
EXB	John	7	29	But I know him , because I am from him , and he sent me. ”
EXB	John	7	30	When Jesus said this , they tried to ·seize [ arrest ] him . But no one was able to ·touch him [ L lay a hand on him ] , because ·it was not yet the right time [ L his hour had not yet come ; see 2:4 ] .
EXB	John	7	31	But many ·of the people [ L in the crowd ] believed in Jesus . They said , “ When the ·Christ [ Messiah ] comes , will he do more ·miracles [ L signs ] than this man has done ? ” The Leaders Try to Arrest Jesus
EXB	John	7	32	The Pharisees [ see 1:24 ] heard the crowd ·whispering [ arguing ; murmuring ; grumbling ] these things about Jesus . So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple ·guards [ police ; officers ] to ·arrest [ seize ] him .
EXB	John	7	33	[ L Therefore ] Jesus said , “ I will be with you a little while longer . Then I will go back to the One who sent me .
EXB	John	7	34	You will ·look for [ seek ] me , but you will not find me . And you can not come where I am [ C in heaven ] . ”
EXB	John	7	35	[ L Therefore ] ·Some people [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] said to each other , “ Where will this man go so we can not find him ? Will he go to the ·Greek cities where our people live [ L dispersion/scattering among the Greeks ; C ever since the Babylonian exile many Jewish people had lived outside the land of Israel ] and teach the Greek people there ? [ C The Jews often used “ Greeks ” for Gentiles generally . ]
EXB	John	7	36	What did he mean when he said , ‘ You will look for me , but you will not find me , ’ and ‘ You can not come where I am ’ ? ” Jesus Talks About the Spirit
EXB	John	7	37	On the last and ·most important [ L greatest ] day of the feast Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice , “ Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink . [ C The feast of Shelters/Tabernacles featured a water pouring ritual that may stand in the background of Jesus ’ speech . ]
EXB	John	7	38	If anyone believes in me , rivers of living water will flow out from that person ’ s ·heart [ L belly ; gut ] , as the Scripture says [ Is . 55:1 ; 58:11 ; Ezek . 47:1–12 ; Zech . 14:8 , compare John 4:10–11 ; Rev . 7:17 ; 22:1 ] . ”
EXB	John	7	39	Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit . The Spirit had not yet been given , because Jesus had not yet been ·raised to glory [ glorified ] . But later , those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit . The People Argue About Jesus
EXB	John	7	40	When the people heard Jesus ’ words , some of them said , “ This man really is the Prophet [ 1:21 ; C the “ prophet like Moses ” of Deut . 18:15–18 ] . ”
EXB	John	7	41	Others said , “ He is the ·Christ [ Messiah ] . ” Still others said , “ The ·Christ [ Messiah ] will not come from Galilee .
EXB	John	7	42	The Scripture says that the ·Christ [ Messiah ] will come from David ’ s ·family [ offspring ; L seed ;
EXB	John	7	43	So ·the people did not agree with each other [ L there was a division in the crowd ] about Jesus .
EXB	John	7	44	Some of them wanted to ·arrest [ seize ] him , but no one was able to ·touch [ L lay a hand on ] him . Some Leaders Won ’ t Believe
EXB	John	7	45	[ L Therefore ] The Temple ·guards [ police ; officers ] went back to the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the Pharisees , who asked , “ Why didn ’ t you bring Jesus ? ”
EXB	John	7	46	The ·guards [ police ; officers ] answered , “ ·The words he says are greater than the words of any other person who has ever spoken [ L No one has ever spoken like this ] ! ”
EXB	John	7	47	[ L Therefore ] The Pharisees answered them , “ So Jesus has ·fooled [ deceived ; led astray ] you also !
EXB	John	7	48	Have any of the ·leaders [ rulers ; authorities ] or the Pharisees believed in him ? No !
EXB	John	7	49	But ·these people [ L this crowd ] , who know nothing about the law , are ·under God ’ s curse [ accursed ] . ”
EXB	John	7	50	Nicodemus , who had gone to see Jesus before [ see 3:1–21 ] , was in that group . He said ,
EXB	John	7	51	“ ·Our law does not [ L Does our law… ? ] judge a person without hearing him and knowing what he has done. ”
EXB	John	7	52	They answered , “ Are you from Galilee , too ? ·Study the Scriptures , and you will learn [ L Search and see ] that no prophet comes from Galilee. ” Some of the earliest surviving Greek copies do not contain 7:53—8:11 . |53 And everyone left and went home . Footnotes - John 7:8 yet Some Greek copies do not have this word .
EXB	John	8	8	Then Jesus ·bent over [ stooped down ] again and wrote on the ground .
EXB	John	8	2	But ·early in the morning [ at dawn ] he went back to the Temple [ courts ; 2:14 ] , and all the people came to him , and he sat and taught them .
EXB	John	8	3	; Rom . 5:12 ] and ·was against the truth [ does not uphold the truth ] , because there is no truth in him . When he tells a lie , ·he shows what he is really like [ he reveals his own nature ; or he speaks his own language ; L he speaks from his own ] , because he is a liar and the father of lies .
EXB	John	8	4	They said to Jesus , “ Teacher , this woman was caught ·having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband [ in the very act of committing adultery ] .
EXB	John	8	5	The law of Moses commands that we stone to death every woman who does this [ compare Lev . 20:10 ; Deut . 22:22–24 ] . What do you say we should do ? ”
EXB	John	8	6	They were asking this to ·trick [ trap ; test ] Jesus so that they could have some ·charge [ accusation ] against him . But Jesus ·bent over [ stooped down ] and started writing on the ground with his finger [ C we do not know what he is writing though there has been much speculation ] .
EXB	John	8	7	When they continued to ask Jesus their question , he ·raised up [ straightened ] and said , “ Anyone here who ·has never sinned [ is guiltless ; T is without sin ] can throw the first stone at her [ Deut . 13:9 ; 17:7 ; comp . Lev . 24:14 ] . ”
EXB	John	8	9	] and ·have a demon in you [ are demon-possessed ] . Are we not right ? ”
EXB	John	8	10	Jesus ·raised up [ straightened ] again and asked her , “ Woman [ C a respectful term of address in Greek ; see 2:4 ] , where are they ? Has no one ·judged you guilty [ condemned you ] ? ”
EXB	John	8	11	She answered , “ No one , sir. ” Then Jesus said , “ I also don ’ t ·judge you guilty [ condemn you ] . ·You may go now , but don ’ t sin anymore [ T Go , and sin no more ] . ” | Jesus Is the Light of the World
EXB	John	8	12	Later , Jesus talked to the people again , saying , “ I am the light of the world [ C the Feast of Shelters included a lamp lighting ritual that Jesus may be alluding to ; 7:37–39 ] . The person who follows me will never ·live [ L walk ] in darkness but will have the light ·that gives life [ L of life ] . ”
EXB	John	8	13	The Pharisees [ see 1:24 ] said to Jesus , “ When you ·talk [ testify ; witness ] about yourself , ·you are the only one to say these things are true . We can not accept what you say [ L your testimony/witness is not true/valid ; 5:31 ] . ”
EXB	John	8	14	Jesus answered , “ Yes , I am ·saying these things [ witnessing ; testifying ] about myself , but they are true [ valid ] . I know where I came from [ C from the Father or “ from above ” ] and where I am going . But you don ’ t know where I came from or where I am going .
EXB	John	8	15	You judge ·by human standards [ T according to the flesh ; C rather than guided by the Spirit ] . I am not judging anyone .
EXB	John	8	16	But ·when [ if ] I do judge , ·I judge truthfully [ L my judgment is true ] , because I am not alone . The Father who sent me is with me .
EXB	John	8	17	Your own law says that ·when two witnesses say the same thing , you must accept what they say [ L the testimony of two witnesses is true/valid ; Deut . 17:6 ; 19:15 ] .
EXB	John	8	18	I am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself , and the Father who sent me is the other witness. ”
EXB	John	8	19	[ L Therefore ] They asked him , “ Where is your father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t know me or my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father , too. ”
EXB	John	8	20	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple [ courts ] , near ·where the money is kept [ the treasury ; offering box ] . But no one ·arrested [ seized ] him , because ·the right time for him [ L his hour ; see 2:4 ] had not yet come . The People Misunderstand Jesus
EXB	John	8	21	Again , Jesus said to the people , “ I will leave you [ C when he dies , is raised , and ascends to the Father ] , and you will ·look for [ seek ; search for ] me , but you will die in your ·sins [ L sin ; C of unbelief ] . You can not come where I am going. ”
EXB	John	8	22	So the Jews asked , “ Will he kill himself ? Is that why he said , ‘ You can not come where I am going ’ ? ”
EXB	John	8	23	Jesus said , “ You people are from here below [ C from the earth ] , but I am from above [ C from heaven or from God ] . You belong to this world , but I ·don ’ t belong to this world [ L am not of this world ] .
EXB	John	8	24	So I told you that you would die in your sins . Yes , you will die in your sins if you don ’ t believe that ·I am he [ L I am ; C this may be an allusion to God ’ s ( Yahweh ’ s ) self identification either from Ex . 3:14 ( the great “ I AM ” ) or Is . 40—55 , where God repeatedly says , “ I am he ” ) ] . ”
EXB	John	8	25	[ L Therefore ] They asked , “ Then who are you ? ” Jesus answered them , “ ·I am what I have told you from the beginning [ or Why do I speak to you at all ? ] .
EXB	John	8	26	I have many things to say and ·decide about you [ or condemn/judge you for ] . But I tell ·people [ the world ] only the things I have heard from the One who sent me , and he speaks the truth. ”
EXB	John	8	27	The people did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father .
EXB	John	8	28	So Jesus said to them , “ When you lift up [ C on the cross ] the Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] , you will know that ·I am he [ L I am ; C see 8:24 ] . You will know that these things I do are not ·by my own authority [ on my own ] but that I say only what the Father has taught me .
EXB	John	8	29	The One who sent me is with me . I always do what is pleasing to him , so he has not left me alone. ”
EXB	John	8	30	While Jesus was saying these things , many people believed in him . Freedom from Sin
EXB	John	8	31	So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him , “ If you ·continue to obey my teaching [ L remain/abide in my word ] , you are truly my ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	John	8	32	Then you will know the truth , and the truth will ·make [ set ] you free. ”
EXB	John	8	33	They answered , “ We are Abraham ’ s ·children [ descendants ; L seed ; Gen. 12:1–3 ] , and we have never been anyone ’ s slaves . So why do you say we will be free ? ”
EXB	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , everyone who ·lives in sin [ commits/practices sin ] is a slave to sin .
EXB	John	8	35	A slave does not ·stay with a family [ live in the household ] forever , but a son ·belongs to the family [ lives in the household ] forever .
EXB	John	8	36	So if the Son makes you free , you will be ·truly free [ T free indeed ] .
EXB	John	8	37	I know you are Abraham ’ s ·children [ descendants ; L seed ] , but you ·want [ are trying ; seek ] to kill me because ·you don ’ t accept my teaching [ L my word has no place in you ; C thus showing they were Abraham ’ s children only physically , not spiritually ; Jer . 9:25–26 ; Rom . 9:7 ; Gal . 4:21–31 ] .
EXB	John	8	38	I am telling you ·what my Father has shown me [ L what I have seen in the Father ’ s presence ] , but you do what ·your father [ or the Father ] has told you. ”
EXB	John	8	39	They answered , “ Our father is Abraham. ” Jesus said to them , “ If you were really Abraham ’ s children , you would do [ a ] the things Abraham did .
EXB	John	8	40	I am a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God , but you are trying to kill me . Abraham did nothing like that .
EXB	John	8	41	So you are doing the things your own father did. ” But [ or Therefore ] they said to him , “ We are not ·like children who never knew who their father was [ illegitimate children ; L born from/of fornication ] . God is our Father ; he is the only Father we have. ”
EXB	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were really your Father , you would love me , because I came from God and now I am here . [ L For ] I did not come ·by my own authority [ on my own ] ; God sent me .
EXB	John	8	43	You don ’ t understand [ L Why don ’ t you understand… ? ] what I say , because you can not ·accept my teaching [ L hear my word/message ] .
EXB	John	8	44	You ·belong to [ are from ] your father the devil , and you want to do what he wants . He was a murderer from the beginning [ Gen.
EXB	John	8	45	But because I speak the truth , you don ’ t believe me .
EXB	John	8	46	·Can any of you [ L Who among you can… ? ] ·prove that I am guilty [ convict me ] of sin ? If I am telling the truth , why don ’ t you believe me ?
EXB	John	8	47	The person who belongs to God ·accepts what God says [ L hears/obeys the words of God ] . But you don ’ t ·accept what God says [ hear ; obey ] , because you don ’ t belong to God. ” Jesus Is Greater than Abraham
EXB	John	8	48	·They [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] answered , “ We say you are a Samaritan [ C a people disliked by the Jews ; 4:4 ,
EXB	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I ·have no demon in me [ am not demon-possessed ] . I give honor to my Father , but you dishonor me .
EXB	John	8	50	I am not trying to get ·honor [ glory ] for myself . There is One who wants this ·honor [ glory ] for me , and he is the judge .
EXB	John	8	51	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , whoever ·obeys my teaching will never die [ L keeps my word will never see death ] . ”
EXB	John	8	52	[ L Therefore ] ·They [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] said to Jesus , “ Now we know that you ·have a demon in you [ are demon-possessed ] ! Even Abraham and the prophets died . But you say , ‘ Whoever ·obeys my teaching will never die [ L keeps my word will never taste death ] . ’
EXB	John	8	53	Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham , who died ? And the prophets died , too . ·Who do you think you are [ or Who are you claiming/pretending to be ] ? ”
EXB	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I give ·honor [ glory ] to myself , that ·honor [ glory ] is worth nothing . The One who gives me ·honor [ glory ] is my Father , and you say he is your God .
EXB	John	8	55	You don ’ t really know him , but I know him . If I said I did not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I ·obey what he says [ L keep his word ] .
EXB	John	8	56	Your father Abraham ·was very happy [ rejoiced ] that he would see my day [ C the day of the Messiah ’ s arrival ] . He saw that day and was glad. ”
EXB	John	8	57	[ L Therefore ] ·They [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] said to him , “ You have never seen Abraham ! You are not even fifty years old [ C Abraham had been dead for almost 2,000 years ] . ”
EXB	John	8	58	Jesus answered , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , before Abraham was even born , ·I am ! ” [ C A claim to deity ; see comments at 8:24 ; 10:28 . ]
EXB	John	8	59	When Jesus said this , the people picked up stones to throw at him [ C believing he had committed blasphemy worthy of death ] . But Jesus hid himself , and then he left the Temple . Footnotes - John 8:39 If … do Some Greek copies read “ If you are really Abraham ’ s children , you will do . ”
EXB	John	9	9	Some said , “ He is the one , ” but others said , “ No , he only looks like him. ” The man himself said , “ I am the man. ”
EXB	John	9	2	His ·followers [ disciples ] asked him , “ ·Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , whose sin caused this man to be born blind—his own sin or his parents ’ sin ? ” [ C The disciples , like the friends of Job , viewed suffering as the result of a person ’ s own sins . ]
EXB	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ It is not this man ’ s sin or his parents ’ sin that made him blind . This man was born blind so that God ’ s ·power [ L works ] could be ·shown [ displayed ; revealed ; manifest ] in him .
EXB	John	9	4	While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me . Night is coming [ C Jesus ’ death ] , when no one can work .
EXB	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world [ see 8:12 ] . ”
EXB	John	9	6	After Jesus said this , he spit on the ground and made some mud with ·it [ L the saliva ] and ·put [ spread ; anointed ] the mud on the man ’ s eyes [ C the significance of the mud made with spit is unclear ] .
EXB	John	9	7	Then he told the man , “ Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam. ” ( Siloam [ C from a Hebrew word ] means Sent . ) So the man went , washed , and came back seeing .
EXB	John	9	8	The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said , “ Isn ’ t this the same man who used to sit and beg ? ”
EXB	John	9	10	[ L Therefore ] They asked him , “ How [ L then ] ·did you get your sight [ L were your eyes opened ] ? ”
EXB	John	9	11	He answered , “ The man named Jesus made some mud and ·put [ spread ; anointed ] it on my eyes . Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash . So I went and washed , and then I could see. ”
EXB	John	9	12	They asked him , “ Where is this man ? ” “ I don ’ t know , ” he answered . Pharisees Question the Healing
EXB	John	9	13	Then the people took to the Pharisees [ C a religious party which strictly observed OT laws and later customs ] the man who had been blind .
EXB	John	9	14	The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day [ C on which no work was allowed ] .
EXB	John	9	15	So now the Pharisees asked the man , “ How did you get your sight ? ” He answered , “ He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and now I see. ”
EXB	John	9	16	So some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man does not keep the Sabbath day [ C according to rabbinic tradition neither kneading nor healing were permitted on the Sabbath ] , so he is not from God. ” But others said , “ ·A man who is a sinner can ’ t [ L How can a man who is a sinner… ? ] do ·miracles [ L signs ] like these. ” So ·they could not agree with each other [ L there was a division among them ] .
EXB	John	9	17	[ L Therefore ; So ; Then ] They asked the man again , “ What do you say about him , since it was your eyes he opened ? ” The man answered , “ He is a prophet. ”
EXB	John	9	18	·These leaders [ L The Jews ; C the Pharisees ] did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again . So they sent for the ·man ’ s parents [ L parents of the man who could now see ]
EXB	John	9	19	and asked them , “ Is this your son who you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
EXB	John	9	20	[ L Therefore ; So ] His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
EXB	John	9	21	But we don ’ t know how he can now see . We don ’ t know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is old enough to speak for himself [ C of legal age to give testimony ] . ”
EXB	John	9	22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the ·elders [ Jewish leaders ; L Jews ] , who had already decided that anyone who ·said [ confessed ; acknowledged ] Jesus was the ·Christ [ Messiah ] would be ·avoided [ L put out of the synagogue ; C an act of expulsion or excommunication ] .
EXB	John	9	23	That is why his parents said , “ He is old enough . Ask him. ”
EXB	John	9	24	So for the second time , they called the man who had been blind . They said , “ ·You should give God the glory by telling the truth [ L Give God the glory ; C see Josh . 7:19 where this phrase is a command to tell the truth ] . We know that this man is a sinner. ”
EXB	John	9	25	[ L So ; Then ] He answered , “ I don ’ t know if he is a sinner . One thing I do know : I was blind , and now I see. ”
EXB	John	9	26	[ L So ; Then ] They asked , “ What did he do to you ? How did he ·make you see again [ L open your eyes ] ? ”
EXB	John	9	27	He answered them , “ I already told you , and you didn ’ t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his ·followers [ disciples ] too ? ”
EXB	John	9	28	Then they ·insulted [ ridiculed ; reviled ] him and said , “ You are his ·follower [ disciple ] , but we are ·followers [ disciples ] of Moses .
EXB	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses [ Ex . 33:11 ; Num . 12:8 ; Deut . 34:10 ] , but we don ’ t even know where this man comes from. ”
EXB	John	9	30	The man answered , “ This is a very ·strange [ astonishing ; marvelous ] thing . You don ’ t know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
EXB	John	9	31	We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he listens to anyone who ·worships [ is devout ; is godfearing ] and ·obeys him [ L does his will ] .
EXB	John	9	32	Nobody has ·ever [ or since the beginning of the world ; L from the age/eternity ] heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind .
EXB	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he could do nothing. ”
EXB	John	9	34	They answered , “ You were born ·full of sin [ or in utter sinfulness ] ! Are you trying to teach us ? ” And they threw him out [ C of the synagogue ; an act of excommunication ] . Spiritual Blindness
EXB	John	9	35	When Jesus heard that they had ·thrown [ cast ; driven ] him out [ C of the synagogue ] , Jesus found him and said , “ Do you ·believe [ trust ] in the Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] ? ”
EXB	John	9	36	, but here may have a more solemn sense ] , I ·believe [ trust ] ! ” Then the man ·worshiped [ prostrated himself before ] Jesus .
EXB	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have seen him . ·The Son of Man [ L He ] is the one talking with you. ”
EXB	John	9	38	He said , “ ·Lord [ C the same word is rendered “ sir ” in v.
EXB	John	9	39	Jesus said , “ I came into this world ·so that the world could be judged [ L for judgment ] . I came so that the blind would see and so that those who see will become blind. ” [ C Those who acknowledge they are spiritually blind will see the truth ; and those who think they see spiritually ( the Jewish religious leaders ) are actually blind ; Is . 6:10 ; 42:19 . ]
EXB	John	9	40	Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked , “ Are you saying we are blind , too ? ”
EXB	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , “ If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin . But since you keep saying you see , your ·guilt [ or sin ] remains . ”
EXB	John	10	10	A thief comes [ L only ] to steal and kill and destroy , but I came ·to give life [ L that they might have life ] —life in all its ·fullness [ abundance ] .
EXB	John	10	23	and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon ’ s ·Porch [ Portico ; Colonnade ; C on the eastern side of the Temple area ; at a later time Christians gathered there to worship ; Acts 3:11 ; 5:12 ] .
EXB	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ ·It is written [ L Is it not written… ? ] in your law that God said , ‘ I said , you are gods ’ [ Ps . 82:6 ; C the “ gods ” here may be Israel ’ s judges , or the Israelites generally , or angelic powers ] .
EXB	John	10	2	The one who enters by the ·door [ gate ] is the shepherd of the sheep .
EXB	John	10	3	The ·one who guards the door [ gatekeeper ; watchman ] opens it for him . And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out [ compare Num . 27:15–17 ] .
EXB	John	10	4	When he brings all his sheep out , he goes ahead of them , and they follow him because they know his voice .
EXB	John	10	5	But they will never follow a stranger . They will run away from him because they don ’ t know his voice. ”
EXB	John	10	6	Jesus told the people this ·story [ figure of speech ; illustration ; parable ] , but they did not understand what ·it meant [ he was telling them ] . Jesus Is the Good Shepherd
EXB	John	10	7	So Jesus said again , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , I am the ·door [ gate ] for the sheep . [ C Jesus now refers to himself as the door rather than the shepherd . ]
EXB	John	10	8	All the people who came before me were thieves and robbers [ C others who claimed to be the Messiah ] . The sheep did not listen to them .
EXB	John	10	9	I am the ·door [ gate ] , and the person who enters through me will be saved and will be able to come in and go out and find pasture [ compare Ps . 118:20 ] .
EXB	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd [ contrast Zech . 11:17 ] . The good shepherd ·gives [ lays down ] his life for the sheep .
EXB	John	10	12	The ·worker who is paid to keep the sheep [ L hired hand ] is different from the shepherd who owns them . When the worker sees a wolf coming , he runs away and leaves the sheep alone . Then the wolf ·attacks [ or snatches ; seizes ] the sheep and scatters them .
EXB	John	10	13	The man runs away because he is only a ·paid worker [ hired hand ] and does not really care about the sheep .
EXB	John	10	14	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my ·sheep [ L own ] , and my ·sheep [ L own ] know me ,
EXB	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me , and I know the Father . I ·give [ lay down ] my life for the sheep .
EXB	John	10	16	I have other sheep that are not in this ·flock [ fold ; pen ; C a reference to future Gentile followers of Christ ] , and I must bring them also . They will listen to my voice , and there will be one flock and one shepherd .
EXB	John	10	17	The Father loves me because I ·give [ lay down ] my life so that I can ·take [ receive ] it back again .
EXB	John	10	18	No one takes it away from me ; I ·give [ lay down ] my own life ·freely [ voluntarily ; of my own free will ] . I have the ·right [ power ; authority ] to ·give [ lay down ] my life , and I have the ·right [ power ; authority ] to ·take [ receive ] it back . This is what my Father commanded me to do. ”
EXB	John	10	19	Again ·the leaders did not agree with each other [ L there was a division among the Jews ] because of these words of Jesus .
EXB	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ ·A demon has come into him and made him crazy [ L He has a demon and is crazy ] . Why listen to him ? ”
EXB	John	10	21	But others said , “ A man who is ·crazy with a demon [ L demon-possessed ] does not say things like this . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ” Jesus Is Rejected
EXB	John	10	22	The time came for the ·Feast of Dedication [ C also called Hanukkah or the Feast of Lights , recalling the rededication of the Temple in
EXB	John	10	164	bc ] at Jerusalem . It was winter ,
EXB	John	10	24	·Some people [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] gathered around him and said , “ How long will you ·make us wonder [ keep us in suspense ] about you ? If you are the ·Christ [ Messiah ] , tell us plainly. ”
EXB	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you already , but you did not believe . The ·miracles [ L works ] I do in my Father ’ s name ·show who I am [ testify/bear witness about me ] .
EXB	John	10	26	But you don ’ t believe , because you are not my sheep .
EXB	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice ; I know them , and they follow me .
EXB	John	10	28	I give them eternal life , and they will never ·die [ perish ] , and no one can ·steal [ snatch ] them out of my hand .
EXB	John	10	29	My Father gave my sheep to me . He is greater than all , and no person can ·steal [ snatch ] my sheep out of my Father ’ s hand .
EXB	John	10	30	The Father and I are one. ”
EXB	John	10	31	Again some of the ·people [ Jewish leaders ; L Jews ] picked up stones to ·kill [ L stone ] Jesus .
EXB	John	10	32	But he ·said to [ answered ] them , “ I have ·done [ L shown you ] many good works from the Father . Which of these good works are you ·killing [ L stoning ] me for ? ”
EXB	John	10	33	·They [ The Jewish leaders ; L The Jews ] answered him , “ We are not ·killing [ L stoning ] you because of any good work you did , but ·because you speak against God [ L for blasphemy ] . You are only a human , but you ·say you are the same as God [ claim to be God ; L make yourself God ] ! ”
EXB	John	10	35	This Scripture called those people gods who received God ’ s ·message [ word ] , and Scripture ·is always true [ L can not be broken/annulled/set aside ] .
EXB	John	10	36	So why do you say that I ·speak against God [ L blaspheme ] because I said , ‘ I am God ’ s Son ’ ? [ C Jesus is not denying he is God , but is making a lesser-to-greater argument ; if Scripture calls lesser beings “ gods , ” why should they object that he—the One God sent—calls himself the Son of God ? ] I am the one ·God [ L the Father ] ·chose [ consecrated ; set apart ] and sent into the world .
EXB	John	10	37	If I don ’ t do ·what my Father does [ L the works of my Father ] , then don ’ t believe me .
EXB	John	10	38	But if I do ·what my Father does [ the works of my Father ; L them ] , even though you don ’ t believe in me , believe ·what I do [ L the works ] . Then you will ·know [ recognize ; learn ] and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
EXB	John	10	39	[ L So ] They tried to ·take [ seize ; arrest ] Jesus again [ see 7:30 ] , but he escaped from ·them [ L their hands ] .
EXB	John	10	40	Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John had ·first [ or earlier ] baptized . Jesus stayed there ,
EXB	John	10	41	and many people came to him and said , “ John never did a ·miracle [ L sign ] , but everything John said about this man is true. ”
EXB	John	10	42	And in that place many believed in Jesus .
EXB	John	11	11	After Jesus said this , he added , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I am going there to wake him. ”
EXB	John	11	2	Mary was the woman who ·later put perfume on the Lord [ L anointed the Lord with perfume/ointment/fragrant oil ] and wiped his feet with her hair [ 12:1–8 ] . Mary ’ s brother was Lazarus , the man who was now sick .
EXB	John	11	3	So ·Mary and Martha [ L the sisters ] sent someone to tell Jesus , “ Lord , the one you love is sick. ”
EXB	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ This sickness will not end in death . It is for the glory of God , to bring glory to the Son of God. ”
EXB	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
EXB	John	11	6	·But [ or So ] when he heard that Lazarus was sick , he stayed where he was for two more days .
EXB	John	11	7	Then Jesus said to his ·followers [ disciples ] , “ Let ’ s go back to Judea. ”
EXB	John	11	8	The ·followers [ disciples ] said to him , “ But Teacher [ L Rabbi ] , ·some people [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago . Now you want to go back there ? ”
EXB	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours ·in the day [ of daylight ] ? If anyone walks in the daylight , he will not stumble , because he can see by ·this world ’ s light [ C the sun ] .
EXB	John	11	10	But if anyone walks at night , he stumbles because ·there is no light to help him see [ L the light is not in him ] . ”
EXB	John	11	12	; John 2:13 ] . Many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to ·do the special things to make themselves pure [ L purify/consecrate themselves ; Num . 9:6–13 ] .
EXB	John	11	13	[ L But ] Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead , but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping .
EXB	John	11	14	So then Jesus said to them plainly , “ Lazarus is dead .
EXB	John	11	15	And I ·am glad [ rejoice ] for your sakes I was not there so that you may believe . But let ’ s go to him now. ”
EXB	John	11	16	Then Thomas ( the one called Didymus [ C meaning , “ the Twin ” ] ) said to ·the other followers [ his fellow disciples ] , “ Let us also go so that we can die with him. ” Jesus in Bethany
EXB	John	11	17	When Jesus arrived , he learned that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days . [ C Some Jews believed that a soul would stay near a body for up to three days after death . ]
EXB	John	11	18	and
EXB	John	11	600	ft. ] from Jerusalem .
EXB	John	11	19	Many of the Jews had come there to ·comfort [ console ] Martha and Mary about their brother .
EXB	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went out to meet him , but Mary ·stayed [ L was sitting at ] home .
EXB	John	11	21	Martha [ L then ] said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
EXB	John	11	22	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask. ”
EXB	John	11	23	Jesus said , “ Your brother will rise and live again. ”
EXB	John	11	24	Martha answered , “ I know that he will rise and live again in the resurrection on the last day. ” [ C Many Jews , particularly Pharisees , believed in a future bodily resurrection . ]
EXB	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . ·Those who believe [ L The one who believes… ] in me will have life even if they die .
EXB	John	11	26	And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
EXB	John	11	27	Martha answered , “ Yes , Lord . I believe that you are the ·Christ [ Messiah ] , the Son of God , the One ·coming to [ who was to come into ] the world. ” Jesus Weeps
EXB	John	11	28	After Martha said this , she went back and ·talked to [ summoned ] her sister Mary ·alone [ privately ] . Martha said , “ The Teacher is here and he is ·asking for [ summoning ; calling for ] you. ”
EXB	John	11	29	When Mary heard this , she got up quickly and went to Jesus .
EXB	John	11	30	Jesus had not yet come into the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him .
EXB	John	11	31	The Jews were with Mary in the house , ·comforting [ consoling ] her . When they saw her stand and leave quickly , they followed her , thinking she was going to the tomb to weep there .
EXB	John	11	32	But Mary went to the place where Jesus was . When she saw him , she fell at his feet and said , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
EXB	John	11	33	When Jesus saw Mary weeping and the Jews who came with her also weeping , he was ·upset [ L disturbed in spirit ] and was deeply troubled .
EXB	John	11	34	He asked , “ Where ·did you bury [ L have you put ] him ? ” “ Come and see , Lord , ” they said .
EXB	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
EXB	John	11	36	. ] He said , “ ·You people know nothing [ You don ’ t know what you are talking about ] !
EXB	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ ·If Jesus [ L Could not the one who… ] opened the eyes of the blind man , why couldn ’ t he keep ·Lazarus [ L this man ] from dying ? ” Jesus Raises Lazarus
EXB	John	11	38	Again feeling ·very upset [ deeply disturbed/moved ] , Jesus came to the tomb . It was a cave with a large stone ·covering the entrance [ L lying on/against it ; C Jews typically buried their dead in caves with stones covering the entrance ] .
EXB	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Move the stone away. ” Martha , the sister of the dead man , said , “ But , Lord , it has been ·four days since he died [ see 11:17 ] . There will be a ·bad smell [ stench ] . ”
EXB	John	11	40	Then Jesus said to her , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God ? ”
EXB	John	11	41	So they moved the stone away from the entrance . Then Jesus ·looked up [ L raised his eyes ] and said , “ Father , I thank you that you heard me .
EXB	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me , but I said these things ·because [ for the benefit ] of the people here around me . ·I want them to [ L so that they might ] believe that you sent me. ”
EXB	John	11	43	After Jesus said this , he cried out in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come ·out [ T forth ] ! ”
EXB	John	11	44	The dead man came out , his hands and feet wrapped with ·pieces of cloth [ strips of linen ; graveclothes ; C the dead were wrapped in strips of cloth ] , and a cloth around his face . Jesus said to them , “ Take the cloth off of him and let him go. ” The Plan to Kill Jesus
EXB	John	11	45	[ L So ] Many of the ·people [ L Jews ] , who had come to visit Mary and saw what Jesus did , believed in him .
EXB	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
EXB	John	11	47	Then the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the ·council [ L Sanhedrin ; C the highest Jewish court of the time ] . They asked , “ ·What should we do ? [ or What are we accomplishing ? ] This man is doing many ·miracles [ L signs ] .
EXB	John	11	48	If we let him continue doing these things , everyone will believe in him . Then the Romans will come and take away our ·Temple [ L place ; C probably a reference to the “ holy place ” —the Jerusalem Temple ] and our nation. ”
EXB	John	11	49	One of the men there was Caiaphas , the high priest that year . [ C He was high priest between ad
EXB	John	11	50	You don ’ t realize that it is better [ L for you ] for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed. ”
EXB	John	11	51	Caiaphas did not ·think of this himself [ L say this from himself ] . As high priest that year , he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation
EXB	John	11	52	and for God ’ s scattered children to bring them all together and make them one . [ C Although Caiaphas was thinking politically , his words predicted spiritual salvation . ]
EXB	John	11	53	[ L So from ] That day they started ·planning [ plotting ] to kill Jesus .
EXB	John	11	54	So Jesus no longer ·traveled [ L walked ] openly among the ·people [ Jews ] . He ·left there [ withdrew ; departed ] and went to a ·place [ region ] near the ·desert [ wilderness ] , to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	John	11	55	It was almost time for the ·Passover Feast [ L Passover of the Jews ; C the annual festival that celebrates God ’ s rescue of Israel from Egypt ; Ex .
EXB	John	11	56	The people ·looked for [ sought ] Jesus and stood in the Temple [ courts ] asking each other , “ ·Is he [ L Surely he is not ] coming to the Feast ? What do you think ? ”
EXB	John	11	57	But the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was , he must tell them . Then they could ·arrest [ seize ] him .
EXB	John	12	12	; John 2:13 ] heard that Jesus was coming there .
EXB	John	12	2	There they had a dinner for Jesus . Martha served the food , and Lazarus was one of the people ·eating [ L reclining ; C it was customary to eat formal meals while reclining around a low table ] with Jesus .
EXB	John	12	3	[ L Then ] Mary brought in a pint [ C Greek litra ; about eleven ounces , weighing just under a pound ] of very expensive ·perfume [ ointment/fragrant oil ] made from pure nard . She ·poured the perfume on [ anointed ; C not the word for royal or priestly anointing , but for hospitality or care ] Jesus ’ feet , and then she wiped his feet with her hair . And the ·sweet smell [ fragrance ] from the perfume filled the whole house .
EXB	John	12	4	Judas Iscariot , one of Jesus ’ ·followers [ disciples ] who would later ·turn against [ betray ] him , was there . Judas said ,
EXB	John	12	5	“ This ·perfume [ ointment/fragrant oil ] was worth an ·entire year ’ s wages [ L three hundred denarii ] . Why wasn ’ t it sold and the money given to the poor ? ”
EXB	John	12	6	But Judas did not really care about the poor ; he said this because he was a thief . He was the one who kept the money ·box [ or bag ] , and he often stole from it .
EXB	John	12	7	[ L Therefore ] Jesus answered , “ Leave her alone . It was right for her to save this perfume for today , the day for me to be prepared for burial .
EXB	John	12	8	[ L For ] You will always have the poor with you , but you will not always have me. ” The Plot Against Lazarus
EXB	John	12	9	A large crowd of ·people [ L Jews ] ·heard [ learned ; came to know ] that Jesus was ·in Bethany [ L there ] . So they went there to see not only Jesus but Lazarus , whom Jesus raised from the dead .
EXB	John	12	10	So the leading [ T chief ] priests ·made plans [ plotted ; counseled together ] to kill Lazarus too .
EXB	John	12	11	Because of Lazarus many of the Jews were ·leaving [ going away from ; deserting ] them and believing in Jesus . Jesus Enters Jerusalem ( A )
EXB	John	12	13	So they took branches of palm trees [ C a symbol of the nation of Israel ] and went out to meet Jesus , shouting , “ ·Praise God [ L Hosanna ; C an Aramaic cry to God for salvation , which became a shout of praise ] ! ·God bless [ L Blessed is ] the One who comes in the name of the Lord [ Ps . 118:25–26 ] ! ·God bless [ L Blessed is ] the King of Israel ! ”
EXB	John	12	14	Jesus found a ·colt [ young donkey ] and sat on it . ·This was as the Scripture says [ L As it is written ] ,
EXB	John	12	15	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ·people of Jerusalem [ L Daughter of Zion ; C a term of endearment for the people of Jerusalem ] ! Your king is coming , sitting on the colt of a donkey [ Zech . 9:9 ; C riding a donkey rather than a warhorse , perhaps signaling that he was a different sort of king than their nationalist expectations anticipated ] . ”
EXB	John	12	16	The ·followers [ disciples ] of Jesus did not understand this at first . But after Jesus was ·raised to glory [ L glorified ] , they remembered that this had been written about him and that they had done these things to him . People Tell About Jesus
EXB	John	12	17	There had been ·many people [ a crowd ] with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from the dead and told him to come out of the tomb . Now they were ·telling others [ testifying ; witnessing ] about what Jesus did .
EXB	John	12	18	·Many people [ A crowd ] went out to meet Jesus , because they had heard ·about this miracle [ L that he had done this sign ] .
EXB	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to each other , “ You can see that ·nothing is going right for us [ we are getting nowhere ; L you are gaining nothing ] . Look ! The whole world ·is following [ has gone after ] him. ” Jesus Talks About His Death
EXB	John	12	20	There were some Greek people [ C Gentiles—here meant to represent people from all over the world ; 12:19 ] , too , who came to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover Feast .
EXB	John	12	21	[ L So ] They went to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and ·said [ requested ] , “ Sir , we would like to ·see [ meet ] Jesus. ”
EXB	John	12	22	Philip told Andrew , and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus .
EXB	John	12	23	Jesus ·said to [ answered ; replied to ] them , “ The ·time [ L hour ] has come for the Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] to ·receive his glory [ be glorified ; C through his death , resurrection , and ascension ] .
EXB	John	12	24	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die to make ·many seeds [ L much fruit ] . But if it never dies , it remains only a single ·seed [ grain ] .
EXB	John	12	25	·Those who [ L The one who… ] love their lives will lose them , but those who hate their lives in this world will ·keep [ guard ; preserve ] ·true life forever [ L it for eternal life ] .
EXB	John	12	26	Whoever serves me must follow me . Then my servant will be with me everywhere I am . My Father will honor anyone who serves me .
EXB	John	12	27	“ Now ·I am very [ L my soul is ] troubled . Should I say , ‘ Father , save me from this ·time [ L hour ] ’ ? No , ·I came to this time so I could suffer [ L for this reason I have come to this hour ] .
EXB	John	12	28	Father , ·bring glory to [ glorify ; honor ] your name ! ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have ·brought glory to [ glorified ] it , and I will ·do [ L glorify ; honor ] it again. ”
EXB	John	12	29	The crowd standing there , who heard the voice , said it was thunder . But others said , “ An angel has spoken to him. ”
EXB	John	12	30	Jesus ·said [ responded ] , “ That voice was for your sake , not mine .
EXB	John	12	31	Now is the time for the world to be judged ; now the ·ruler [ prince ] of this world [ C Satan ] will be ·thrown down [ L cast/driven out ] .
EXB	John	12	32	·If [ or When ] I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw all people ·toward me [ to myself ] . ”
EXB	John	12	33	Jesus said this to show ·how [ what kind of death ] he would die .
EXB	John	12	34	The crowd ·said [ responded to him ] , “ We have heard from the ·law [ C the Old Testament ] that the ·Christ [ Messiah ] will ·live [ remain ] forever [ Ps . 89:35–37 ; Is . 9:7 ; Ezek . 37:25 ] . So why do you say , ‘ The Son of Man must be lifted up ’ ? Who is this ‘ Son of Man ’ ? ”
EXB	John	12	35	Then Jesus said , “ The light will be ·with [ among ] you for a little longer , so walk while you have the light . Then the darkness will not ·catch [ overtake ] you . ·If you walk [ L The one who walks ] in the darkness , you will not know where you are going .
EXB	John	12	36	·Believe [ Put your trust ] in the light while you still have it so that you will become children of light. ” When Jesus had said this , he left and hid himself from them . Some People Won ’ t Believe in Jesus
EXB	John	12	37	Though Jesus had done many ·miracles [ L signs ; 2:11 ] in front of the people , they still did not believe in him .
EXB	John	12	38	This was to ·bring about [ L fulfill ] ·what [ L the message/word that ] Isaiah the prophet had said : “ Lord , who believed ·what we told them [ L our message/report ] ? Who saw the Lord ’ s ·power [ L arm ; C a symbol of his power ] in this [ Is . 53:1 ] ? ”
EXB	John	12	39	This is why the people could not believe : Isaiah also had said ,
EXB	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes , and he has ·closed their minds [ L hardened their heart ] . Otherwise they would see with their eyes and understand in their ·minds [ L heart ] and ·come back to me and be healed [ L turn/repent , and I would heal them ; Is . 6:10 ] . ”
EXB	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus ’ glory and spoke about him .
EXB	John	12	42	But many believed in Jesus , even many of the ·leaders [ authorities ] . But because of the Pharisees , they did not ·say they believed in him [ L confess/proclaim him/it ] for fear they would be put out of the synagogue .
EXB	John	12	43	They loved ·praise [ glory ] from people more than ·praise [ glory ] from God .
EXB	John	12	44	Then Jesus cried out , “ Whoever believes in me is really believing in the One who sent me .
EXB	John	12	45	Whoever sees me sees the One who sent me .
EXB	John	12	46	I have come as light into the world so that whoever believes in me would not ·stay [ remain ] in darkness .
EXB	John	12	47	“ Anyone who hears my words and does not ·obey [ keep ] them , I do not judge , because I did not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
EXB	John	12	48	There is a judge for those who ·refuse to believe in [ reject ] me and do not accept my words . The word I have ·taught [ spoken ] will ·be their judge [ judge them ] on the last day .
EXB	John	12	49	The things I ·taught [ spoke ] were not from myself . The Father who sent me ·told [ commanded ] me what to say and what to ·teach [ speak ] .
EXB	John	12	50	And I know that eternal life comes from what the Father commands . So whatever I say is what the Father told me to say . ”
EXB	John	13	13	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord ’ [ C titles appropriately ascribed to an esteemed Rabbi , but which took on deeper meaning after his death and resurrection ] , and you are right , because that is what I am .
EXB	John	13	2	·Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal [ L It was dinnertime ] . The devil had already ·persuaded [ L put it into the heart of ] Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon , to ·turn against [ betray ] Jesus .
EXB	John	13	3	Jesus knew that the Father had ·given him power over everything [ L placed everything into his hands ] and that he had come from God and was going back to God .
EXB	John	13	4	So ·during the meal [ L from supper ] Jesus stood up and took off his outer clothing . Taking a towel , he wrapped it around his waist .
EXB	John	13	5	Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the ·followers ’ [ disciples ’ ] feet , ·drying [ wiping ] them with the towel that was wrapped around him . [ C This act was considered so demeaning by some people that they only allowed Gentile slaves to do it . ]
EXB	John	13	6	Jesus came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
EXB	John	13	7	Jesus answered , “ You don ’ t understand now what I am doing , but you will understand later. ”
EXB	John	13	8	Peter said , “ No , you will never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered , “ If I don ’ t wash your feet , you ·are not one of my people [ L have no share/part with me ] . ”
EXB	John	13	9	Simon Peter answered , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but wash my hands and my head , too ! ”
EXB	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ After a person has ·had a bath [ washed ; bathed ] , his whole body is clean . He needs only to wash his feet . And you men are clean , but not all of you. ”
EXB	John	13	11	[ L For ] Jesus knew who would ·turn against [ betray ] him , and that is why he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ”
EXB	John	13	12	When he had finished washing their feet , he put on his clothes and ·sat down [ L reclined ; C the posture for a banquet or dinner party ] again . He asked , “ Do you understand what I have just done ·for [ to ] you ?
EXB	John	13	14	If I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash each other ’ s feet .
EXB	John	13	15	I did this as ·an example [ a pattern ] so that you should do as I have done for you .
EXB	John	13	16	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly , I say to you ] , a ·servant [ slave ; bond-servant ] is not greater than his ·master [ lord ] . [ L And ] A messenger is not greater than the one who sent him .
EXB	John	13	17	If you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them .
EXB	John	13	18	“ I am not talking about all of you . I know those I have chosen . But this is to ·bring about what the Scripture said [ L fulfill the Scripture ] : · ‘ The man who ate at my table has turned against me. ’ [ L ‘ The one who ate bread with me lifted his heel against me ’ ; Ps . 41:9 ; C eating with someone showed an intimate relationship , and lifting one ’ s heel was an act of betrayal . ]
EXB	John	13	19	I am telling you this now before it happens so that when it happens , you will believe that ·I am he [ L I am ; C this may be an allusion to God ’ s ( Yahweh ’ s ) self identification as “ I AM ” in Ex . 3:14 , or to God ’ s repeated claim that “ I am he ” throughout Is . 40—55 ; see John 8:24 ,

EXB	John	13	21	After Jesus said this , he was very troubled [ L in spirit ] . He ·said openly [ bore witness and said ] , “ ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly , I say to you ] , one of you will ·turn against [ betray ] me. ”
EXB	John	13	22	The ·followers [ disciples ] all looked at each other , because they did not know whom Jesus was talking about .
EXB	John	13	23	One of the ·followers [ disciples ] ·sitting next to Jesus [ L reclining at his side/chest ; C an honored position ] was the ·follower [ disciple ] Jesus loved [ C a reference to John ] .
EXB	John	13	24	Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus whom he was talking about .
EXB	John	13	25	That ·follower [ disciple ] ·leaned [ reclined ] closer to Jesus and asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
EXB	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ I will dip this [ piece/morsel of ] bread into the dish . The man I give it to is the man who will ·turn against [ betray ] me. ” So Jesus took a piece of bread , dipped it , and gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
EXB	John	13	27	·As soon as [ After ] Judas took the [ piece/morsel of ] bread , Satan entered him . [ L Then ] Jesus said to him , “ ·The thing that you will do—do it quickly [ T What you do , do quickly ] . ”
EXB	John	13	29	Since he was the one who kept the money ·box [ or bag ] , some of the ·followers [ disciples ] thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the ·feast [ festival ] or to give something to the poor .
EXB	John	13	30	[ L So ] Judas took the [ piece/morsel of ] bread Jesus gave him and immediately went out . It was night . [ C The night is both a time reference and a symbol of Judas ’ evil actions . ]
EXB	John	13	31	When Judas was gone , Jesus said , “ Now the ·Son of Man [ C a title for the Messiah ; Dan . 7:13–14 ] ·receives his glory [ is glorified ] , and God ·receives glory [ is glorified ] through him .
EXB	John	13	32	If God ·receives glory [ is glorified ] through him , [ a ] then God will ·give glory to [ glorify ; honor ] the Son through himself . And God will ·give him glory [ glorify/honor him ] ·quickly [ immediately ; at once ] . ”
EXB	John	13	33	Jesus said , “ ·My children [ or Little children ; C a term of endearment ] , I will be with you only a little longer . You will ·look for [ seek ] me , and what I told the Jews [ 7:33–34 ; 8:21 ] , I tell you now : Where I am going you can not come .
EXB	John	13	34	“ I give you a new ·command [ commandment ] : Love ·each other [ T one another ] . You must love ·each other [ T one another ] as I have loved you .
EXB	John	13	35	All people will know that you are my ·followers [ disciples ] if you love ·each other [ T one another ] . ” Peter Will Say He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus ( B )
EXB	John	13	36	Simon Peter asked Jesus , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I am going you can not follow now , but you will follow later. ”
EXB	John	13	37	Peter asked , “ Lord , why can ’ t I follow you now ? I ·am ready to die for you [ L will lay down my life for you ] ! ”
EXB	John	13	38	Jesus answered , “ ·Are you ready to die for me [ L Will you lay down your life for me ] ? ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly , I say to you ] , before the ·rooster [ cock ] crows , you will ·say three times that you don ’ t know me [ deny/disown me three times ] . ” Footnotes - John 13:32 If … him Some Greek copies do not have this phrase .
EXB	John	14	14	If you ask me for anything in my name , I will do it . The Promise of the Holy Spirit
EXB	John	14	2	There are many ·rooms [ places to live ] in my Father ’ s house [ C heaven , metaphorically portrayed as a great palace ] ; I would not tell you this if it were not true . I am going there to prepare a place for you .
EXB	John	14	3	·After [ L And if ] I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I am .
EXB	John	14	4	You know the way to the place where I am going [ a ] [ C because they know Jesus ; 14:6 ] . ”
EXB	John	14	5	Thomas said to Jesus , “ Lord , we don ’ t know where you are going . So how can we know the way ? ”
EXB	John	14	6	Jesus answered , “ I am ·the way , and the truth , and the life [ or the one true way to have life ] . ·The only way to the Father is through me [ L No one comes to the Father except through me ] .
EXB	John	14	7	If you really knew me , you would know my Father , too . ·But now [ or From now on ] you do know him , and you have seen him. ”
EXB	John	14	8	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father . That is all we need. ”
EXB	John	14	9	Jesus answered , “ I have been with you ·a long time now [ all this time ; for so long ] . Do you still not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . So why do you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
EXB	John	14	10	Don ’ t you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words I say to you don ’ t come ·from me [ on my own authority ] , but the Father ·lives [ remains ; abides ] in me and does his own work .
EXB	John	14	11	Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me . Or believe because of ·the miracles I have done [ L the works themselves ] .
EXB	John	14	12	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly , I say to you ] , whoever believes in me will do the same things that I do . Those who believe will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father . [ C They will do greater things because all believers—not just Jesus—will have the Holy Spirit living in them and empowering them . ]
EXB	John	14	13	And if you ask for anything in my name [ C asking “ in my name ” means acknowledging that Jesus is the mediator between God and human beings ; the name represents the person ] , I will do it for you so that ·the Father ’ s glory will be shown [ L the Father might be glorified ] ·through [ or in ] the Son .
EXB	John	14	15	“ ·If you love me , you will obey my commands [ or If you love me , obey my commands ; C this may be either a declaration or a command ] .
EXB	John	14	16	I will ask the Father , and he will give you another ·Helper [ Counselor ; Advocate ; C the Holy Spirit ] to be with you forever—
EXB	John	14	17	the Spirit of truth . The world can not ·accept [ receive ] him , because it does not see him or know him . But you know him , because he ·lives [ remains ; abides ] with you and he will be ·in [ or among ] you .
EXB	John	14	18	“ I will not leave you all alone like orphans [ C orphans had little or no support in ancient society ] ; I will ·come back [ L come ] to you .
EXB	John	14	19	In a little while the world will not see me anymore , but you will see me . Because I live , you will live , too .
EXB	John	14	20	On that day you will know that I am in my Father , and that you are in me and I am in you .
EXB	John	14	21	Those who ·know [ L have ] my commands and ·obey [ keep ] them are the ones who love me , and my Father will love those who love me . I will love them and will ·show [ reveal ] myself to them. ”
EXB	John	14	22	Then Judas ( not Judas Iscariot [ C probably Judas son of James ; Luke 6:16 ; Acts 1:13 ] ) said , “ But , Lord , ·why do [ how is it that ; what has happened that ] you plan to ·show [ reveal ] yourself to us and not to the rest of the world ? ”
EXB	John	14	23	Jesus answered , “ If people love me , they will ·obey my teaching [ L keep my word ] . My Father will love them , and we will come to them and make our home with them .
EXB	John	14	24	Those who do not love me do not ·obey my teaching [ L keep my words ] . This ·teaching [ word ] that you hear is not really mine ; it is from my Father , who sent me .
EXB	John	14	25	“ I have told you all these things while I ·am [ remain ; abide ] with you .
EXB	John	14	26	But the ·Helper [ Counselor ; Advocate ; see 14:15 ] will teach you ·everything [ all things ] and will ·cause you to remember [ remind you of ] all that I told you . This Helper is the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name .
EXB	John	14	27	“ I leave you peace [ C the Greek word for “ peace ” reflects the Hebrew shalom , a typical Hebrew farewell ; but Jesus ’ peace , in the sense of wholeness , is also a characteristic of the messianic kingdom ] ; my peace I give you . I do not give it to you as the world does . So don ’ t let your hearts be troubled or afraid .
EXB	John	14	28	You heard me say to you , ‘ I am going , but I am coming back to you. ’ If you loved me , you should ·be happy [ rejoice ] that I am going back to the Father , because he is greater than I am .
EXB	John	14	29	I have told you this now , before it happens , so that when it happens , you will believe [ 13:19 ] .
EXB	John	14	30	I will not talk with you much longer , because the ·ruler [ prince ] of this world [ C Satan ] is coming . He has ·no power [ no claim/hold ; L nothing ] over me ,
EXB	John	14	31	but the world must know that I love the Father , so I do ·exactly what [ just as ] the Father ·told [ commanded ] me to do [ C go to the cross ] . “ ·Come now [ L Get up ; Rise up ] , let us go . Footnotes - John 14:4 You … going . Some Greek copies read “ You know where I am going and the way to the place I am going . ”
EXB	John	15	15	I no longer call you ·servants [ slaves ; bond-servants ] , because a ·servant [ slave ; bond-servant ] does not know what his ·master [ lord ] is doing . But I call you friends , because I have made known to you everything I heard from my Father .
EXB	John	15	2	He ·cuts off [ or takes away ] every branch ·of mine [ L in me ] that does not produce fruit [ C whose lives bear no indication of a relationship with Christ ] . And he ·trims and cleans [ prunes ; C the verb implies both trimming and cleaning ] every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit [ Heb . 12:4–11 ] .
EXB	John	15	3	You are already ·clean [ or pruned ] because of the words I have spoken to you .
EXB	John	15	4	·Remain [ Abide ] in me , and I will ·remain [ abide ] in you . A branch can not produce fruit ·alone [ by itself ] but must ·remain [ abide ] in the vine . In the same way , you can not produce fruit alone but must ·remain [ abide ] in me .
EXB	John	15	5	“ I am the vine , and you are the branches . If any ·remain [ abide ] in me and I ·remain [ abide ] in them , they produce much fruit . But ·without [ apart from ] me they can do nothing .
EXB	John	15	6	If any do not ·remain [ abide ] in me , they are like a branch that is thrown away and then ·dies [ withers ; dries up ] . People ·pick up [ gather together ] dead branches , throw them into the fire , and burn them .
EXB	John	15	7	If you ·remain [ abide ] in me and ·follow my teachings [ L my words abide/remain in you ] , you can ask anything you want , and it will ·be given to [ be done for ; come to ] you .
EXB	John	15	8	You should produce much fruit and ·show that you are [ or become ] my ·followers [ disciples ] , which ·brings glory to [ glorifies ] my Father .
EXB	John	15	9	I loved you as the Father loved me . Now ·remain [ abide ] in my love .
EXB	John	15	10	I have ·obeyed [ kept ] my Father ’ s commands , and I ·remain [ abide ] in his love . In the same way , if you ·obey [ keep ] my commands , you will ·remain [ abide ] in my love .
EXB	John	15	11	I have told you these things so that ·you can have the same joy I have [ L my joy may be in you ] and so that your joy ·will be the fullest possible joy [ L might be complete ] .
EXB	John	15	12	“ This is my command : Love each other as I have loved you .
EXB	John	15	13	·The greatest love a person can show is to die for his friends [ L No one has greater love than this : to lay down one ’ s life for one ’ s friends ; C Jesus ’ death is the ultimate expression of this principle ] .
EXB	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
EXB	John	15	16	You did not choose me ; I chose you . And I ·gave you this work : [ appointed you ] to go and produce fruit , fruit that will ·last [ remain ; abide ] . Then the Father will give you anything you ask for in my name [ see 14:13 ] .
EXB	John	15	17	This is my command : Love each other . Jesus Warns His Followers
EXB	John	15	18	“ If the world hates you , remember that it hated me ·first [ before you ] .
EXB	John	15	19	If you ·belonged to [ L were of ] the world , it would love you as it loves its own . But I have chosen you out of the world , ·so [ because ] you don ’ t belong to it . That is why the world hates you .
EXB	John	15	20	Remember ·what [ the word ] I told you : A ·servant [ slave ; bond-servant ] is not greater than his ·master [ lord ; see 13:16 ] . If people ·did wrong to [ persecuted ] me , they will ·do wrong to [ persecute ] you , too . And if they ·obeyed my teaching [ L kept my word ] , they will ·obey [ keep ] yours , too .
EXB	John	15	21	[ L But ] They will do all this to you on account of ·me [ L my name ; 14:13 ] , because they do not know the One who sent me .
EXB	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
EXB	John	15	23	Whoever hates me also hates my Father .
EXB	John	15	24	I did works among them that no one else has ever done . If I had not done these works , they would not be guilty of sin . [ C Jesus ’ words and actions resulted in their guilt because they rejected him despite the evidence ( the “ signs ” ) that God was working through him ; see Matt . 11:20–24 ; Luke 11:31–32 . ] But now they have seen what I have done , and yet they have hated both me and my Father .
EXB	John	15	25	But this happened so that what is written in their law ·would be true [ L might be fulfilled ] : ‘ They hated me for no reason [ C the quote could be from Ps . 35:19 or Ps . 69:4 ] . ’
EXB	John	15	26	“ I will send you the ·Helper [ Counselor ; Advocate ; C the Holy Spirit ] from the Father ; he is the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father . When he comes , he will ·tell [ testify ; witness ] about me ,
EXB	John	15	27	and you also must ·tell people [ testify ; witness ] about me , because you have been with me from the beginning .
EXB	John	16	16	“ After a little while you will not see me [ C after his crucifixion ] , and then after a little while you will see me again [ C after his resurrection ] . ”
EXB	John	16	2	People will ·put you out of [ ban you from ] their synagogues . Yes , ·the time [ L an hour ; C an indefinite reference to a future time but likely connected to the period after the death and resurrection of Christ ] is coming when those who kill you will think they are offering ·service [ worship ] to God .
EXB	John	16	3	They will do this because they have not known the Father and they have not known me .
EXB	John	16	4	I have told you these things now so that when ·the time [ L their hour ; C the time of persecution ] comes you will remember that I ·warned [ told ] you [ about them ] . The Work of the Holy Spirit “ I did not tell you ·these things [ C that they would experience persecution ] ·at [ from ] the beginning , because I was with you then .
EXB	John	16	5	Now I am going back to the One who sent me . But none of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
EXB	John	16	6	Your hearts are filled with ·sadness [ grief ; sorrow ] because I have told you these things .
EXB	John	16	7	But I tell you the truth , it is ·better for you [ for your advantage ] that I go away . [ L For ] When I go away , I will send the ·Helper [ Counselor ; Advocate ; C the Holy Spirit ] to you . If I do not go away , the Helper will not come [ to you ] .
EXB	John	16	8	When the Helper comes , he will ·prove to the people of the world the truth about sin [ L convict/expose/convince the world about sin ] , about ·being right with God [ L righteousness ] , and about judgment [ C the meaning of this sentence is uncertain , as are the explanatory phrases in vv . 9–11 ] .
EXB	John	16	9	·He will prove to them that sin is not believing in me [ L concerning sin , because they do not believe in me ] .
EXB	John	16	10	·He will prove to them that being right with God comes from my going to the Father and not being seen anymore [ L concerning righteousness , because I go to the Father and you will no longer see me ; C probably means the Spirit will convict the world of its empty righteousness because Jesus is no longer present to model true righteousness ] .
EXB	John	16	11	·And the Helper will prove to them that judgment happened when the ruler of this world was judged [ L concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world has been judged ; C probably means the Spirit will convict the world that its judgments are false because Satan—the one they follow—has been condemned by Christ ’ s victory on the cross ] .
EXB	John	16	12	“ I [ L still ] have many more things to say to you , but ·they are too much for you [ L you can not bear them ] now .
EXB	John	16	13	But when the Spirit of truth [ C the Helper ; see 16:7 ] comes , he will ·lead [ guide ] you into all truth . He will not speak ·his own words [ from his own authority ; L from himself ] , but he will speak only what he hears [ C from the Father ] , and he will ·tell [ announce/declare to ] you what is to come .
EXB	John	16	14	The Spirit of truth will ·bring glory to [ glorify ; honor ] me , because he will take what ·I have to say [ L is mine ] and ·tell [ announce ; declare ] it to you .
EXB	John	16	15	All that the Father has is mine . That is why I said that the Spirit will take what ·I have to say [ L what is mine ] and ·tell [ announce ; declare ] it to you . Sadness Will Become Happiness
EXB	John	16	17	[ L Therefore ] Some of the ·followers [ disciples ] ·said to each other [ discussed among themselves ] , “ What does Jesus mean when he says , ‘ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again ’ ? And what does he mean when he says , ‘ Because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
EXB	John	16	18	They also asked , “ What does he mean by ‘ a little while ’ ? We don ’ t understand what he is saying. ”
EXB	John	16	19	Jesus ·saw [ knew ; was aware ] that the ·followers [ disciples ] wanted to ask him about this , so he said to them , “ Are you ·asking each other [ discussing among yourselves ] what I meant when I said , ‘ After a little while you will not see me , and then after a little while you will see me again ’ ?
EXB	John	16	20	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , you will ·cry and be sad [ weep and mourn/lament ] , but the world will be happy . You will ·be sad [ grieve ; have pain ] , but your ·sadness [ grief ; pain ] will become joy .
EXB	John	16	21	When a woman ·gives birth to a baby [ goes into labor ] , she has pain , because her ·time [ L hour ] has come . But when her baby is born , she ·forgets the pain [ does not remember the suffering/affliction ] , because ·she is so happy [ L of the joy ] that a ·child [ L human being ] has been born into the world .
EXB	John	16	22	It is the same with you . Now you are ·sad [ sorrowful ; in pain ; grieving ] , but I will see you again and ·you [ L your heart ] will ·be happy [ rejoice ] , and no one will take away your joy .
EXB	John	16	23	In that day [ C after his resurrection ] you will not ask me for anything . ·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , my Father will give you anything you ask for in my name [ see 14:13 ] .
EXB	John	16	24	Until now you have not asked for anything in my name . Ask and you will receive , so that your joy will be ·the fullest possible joy [ complete ; fulfilled ] . Victory over the World
EXB	John	16	25	“ I have told you these things ·indirectly in stories [ in parables/figurative speech ] . But ·the time [ L the hour ] will come when I will ·not [ no longer ] use ·stories like that [ parables ; figurative speech ; 10:6 ] to tell you things ; I will speak to you in plain words about the Father .
EXB	John	16	26	In that day you will ask the Father for things in my name . I mean , I will not need to ask the Father for you .
EXB	John	16	27	[ L For ] The Father himself loves you . He loves you because you loved me and believed that I came from God .
EXB	John	16	28	I came from the Father into the world . Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father. ”
EXB	John	16	29	Then the ·followers [ disciples ] of Jesus said , “ You are speaking ·clearly [ plainly ] to us now and are not using ·stories that are hard to understand [ parables ; figurative speech ] .
EXB	John	16	30	We can see now that you know all things . ·You can answer a person ’ s question even before it is asked . [ L You do not need anyone to question you . ] This makes us believe you came from God. ”
EXB	John	16	31	Jesus answered , “ So now you believe ?
EXB	John	16	32	Listen to me ; ·a time [ L an hour ] is coming when you will be scattered , each to your own home [ compare Zech . 13:7 ] . That time is now here . You will leave me alone , but I am ·never really [ L not ] alone , because the Father is with me .
EXB	John	16	33	“ I told you these things so that you can have peace in me . In this world you will have ·trouble [ persecution ; suffering ] , but ·be brave [ take courage/heart ] ! I have ·defeated [ victory over ; conquered ; overcome ] the world . ”
EXB	John	17	17	·Make them ready for your service [ Sanctify them ; Consecrate them ; C setting them apart for service ] through your truth ; your ·teaching [ word ] is truth .
EXB	John	17	2	You gave the Son ·power [ authority ] over all ·people [ T flesh ] so that the Son could give eternal life to all those you gave him .
EXB	John	17	3	And this is eternal life : that people know you , the only true God , and that they know Jesus Christ , the One you sent .
EXB	John	17	4	Having ·finished [ completed ] the work you gave me to do , I ·brought you glory [ glorified/honored you ] on earth [ C by leading people to praise God ] .
EXB	John	17	5	And now , Father , ·give me glory [ glorify/honor me ] ·with you [ or in your presence ] ; give me the ·glory [ honor ] I had with you before the world ·was made [ existed ; began ] .
EXB	John	17	6	“ I ·showed what you are like [ L revealed your name ; C God ’ s reputation/character ] to ·those [ L the people ] you gave me from the world . They belonged to you , and you gave them to me , and they have ·obeyed your teaching [ L kept your word ] .
EXB	John	17	7	Now they know that everything you gave me comes from you .
EXB	John	17	8	[ L Because ] I gave them the ·teachings [ words ; utterances ] you gave me , and they ·accepted [ received ] them . They knew that I truly came from you , and they believed that you sent me .
EXB	John	17	9	I am ·praying for them [ asking on their behalf ] . I am not ·praying for [ asking on behalf of ] people in the world but for those you gave me , because they are yours .
EXB	John	17	10	·All I have is yours , and all you have is mine [ L All mine are yours and all yours are mine ] . And ·my glory is shown [ I am glorified ] through them .

EXB	John	17	12	While I was with them , I kept them safe by the power of [ or kept them loyal to ] your name , the name you gave me . I ·protected [ guarded ] them , and only one of them , the ·one worthy of destruction [ L son of destruction/perdition ; C Judas ] , was lost so that the Scripture would ·come true [ L be fulfilled ; Ps . 41:9 ] .
EXB	John	17	13	“ I am coming to you now . But I ·pray [ L say ] these things while I am still in the world so that ·these followers [ these disciples ; L they ] can have all of my joy [ L made complete ; fulfilled ] in them .
EXB	John	17	14	I have given them your ·teaching [ word ] . And the world has hated them , because they don ’ t belong to the world , just as I don ’ t belong to the world .
EXB	John	17	15	I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to ·keep them safe [ protect them ] from the ·Evil One [ or evil ; C the Evil One is the Devil ] .
EXB	John	17	16	They don ’ t belong to the world , just as I don ’ t belong to the world .
EXB	John	17	18	I have sent them into the world , just as you sent me into the world .
EXB	John	17	19	For their sake , I am ·making myself ready to serve [ sanctifying/consecrating myself ] so that they can be ·ready for their service of [ sanctified/consecrated by ] the truth .
EXB	John	17	20	“ I ·pray for these followers [ L ask not only for these ] , but I am also ·praying [ L asking ] for all those who will believe in me because of their ·teaching [ message ; proclamation ; L word ] .
EXB	John	17	21	Father , I ·pray [ L ask ] that they can be one . As you are in me and I am in you , I ·pray [ L ask ] that they can also be ·one in us [ L in us ] . Then the world will believe that you sent me .

EXB	John	18	18	It was cold , so the ·servants [ slaves ; bond-servants ] and guards [ temple police ] had built a [ charcoal ] fire and were standing around it , warming themselves . Peter also was standing with them , warming himself . The High Priest Questions Jesus
EXB	John	18	2	Judas knew where this place was , because Jesus met there often with his ·followers [ disciples ] . Judas was the one who ·turned against [ betrayed ] Jesus .
EXB	John	18	3	So Judas came there with a group of soldiers [ C Roman ] and some guards [ C Jewish temple police ] from the ·leading [ T chief ] priests and the Pharisees . They were carrying torches , lanterns , and weapons .
EXB	John	18	4	Knowing everything that would happen to him , Jesus went out and asked , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ”
EXB	John	18	5	They answered him , “ Jesus ·from Nazareth [ L the Nazarene ] . ” “ ·I am he [ L I am ; C this may be an allusion to God ’ s ( Yahweh ’ s ) self identification as “ I AM ” in Ex . 3:14 or to God ’ s repeated claim that “ I am he ” throughout Is . 40—55 ; see John 8:24 ,
EXB	John	18	28	Early in the morning they [ C the Jewish leaders ] led Jesus from Caiaphas ’ s house to the ·Roman governor ’ s palace [ or governor ’ s headquarters ; L Praetorium ] .

EXB	John	18	6	When Jesus said , “ ·I am he [ L I am ; see 18:5 ] , ” they moved back and fell to the ground .
EXB	John	18	7	Jesus asked them again , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ” They said , “ Jesus ·of Nazareth [ L the Nazarene ] . ”
EXB	John	18	8	“ I told you that I am he [ see 18:5 ] , ” Jesus ·said [ answered ] . “ So if you are looking for me , let the others go. ”
EXB	John	18	9	This happened so that the words Jesus said before would ·come true [ L be fulfilled ] : “ I have not lost any of the ones you gave me [ 6:39 ; 17:12 ] . ”
EXB	John	18	10	[ L Then ] Simon Peter , who had a sword , pulled it out and struck the ·servant [ slave ; bond-servant ] of the high priest , cutting off his right ear . ( The ·servant ’ s [ slave ’ s ; bond-servant ’ s ] name was Malchus . )
EXB	John	18	11	Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back [ L into its sheath ] . Shouldn ’ t I drink the cup the Father gave me ? ” [ C The prophets spoke of a cup of judgment ; by dying on the cross Jesus drinks it on our behalf ; Jer . 25:15–29 . ] Jesus Is Brought Before Annas
EXB	John	18	12	Then the soldiers [ C Roman ] with their commander and the guards [ C Jewish temple police ] arrested Jesus . They tied him
EXB	John	18	13	and led him first to Annas , the father-in-law of Caiaphas , the high priest that year .
EXB	John	18	14	Caiaphas was the one who ·told [ advised ; counseled ] the Jews that it would be better if one man died ·for [ on behalf of ] all the people . Peter Says He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus ( B )
EXB	John	18	15	Simon Peter and another one of Jesus ’ ·followers [ disciples ] ·went along after [ followed ] Jesus . This ·follower [ disciple ] knew the high priest , so he went with Jesus into the high priest ’ s courtyard .
EXB	John	18	16	But Peter waited outside near the ·door [ gate ] . The ·follower [ disciple ] who knew the high priest came back outside , spoke to the ·girl at the door [ gatekeeper ; doorkeeper ] , and brought Peter inside .
EXB	John	18	17	The ·girl at the door [ gatekeeper ; doorkeeper ] said to Peter , “ Aren ’ t you also one of that man ’ s ·followers [ disciples ] ? ” Peter answered , “ No , I am not ! ”
EXB	John	18	19	The high priest asked Jesus questions about his ·followers [ disciples ] and his teaching .
EXB	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken ·openly [ publicly ] to ·everyone [ L the world ] . I have always taught in synagogues and in the Temple , where all the Jews come together . I never said anything in secret .
EXB	John	18	21	So why do you question me ? Ask the people who heard ·my teaching [ L what I said to them ] . They know what I said. ”
EXB	John	18	22	When Jesus said this , one of the ·guards [ officials ; temple police ] standing there ·hit [ slapped ] him . The ·guard [ official ; temple policeman ] said , “ Is that the way you answer the high priest ? ”
EXB	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If I said something wrong , then ·show [ testify to ; witness to ] what it was . But if what I said is ·true [ right ] , why do you hit me ? ”
EXB	John	18	24	Then Annas sent Jesus , who was still tied , to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Says Again He Doesn ’ t Know Jesus ( C )
EXB	John	18	25	As Simon Peter was standing and warming himself , they said to him , “ Aren ’ t you one of that man ’ s ·followers [ disciples ] ? ” Peter ·said it was not true [ denied it ] ; he said , “ No , I am not. ”
EXB	John	18	26	to
EXB	John	18	27	Again Peter ·said it wasn ’ t true [ denied it ] . At once ·a rooster [ T the cock ] crowed . Jesus Is Brought Before Pilate ( D )
EXB	John	18	29	So Pilate [ C Pontius Pilate , the Roman governor of Judea from ad
EXB	John	18	37	Pilate said , “ So you are a king ! ” Jesus answered , “ You are the one saying I am a king . This is why I was born and came into the world : to ·tell people [ testify/witness to ] the truth . And everyone ·who belongs to the [ on the side of ] truth ·listens to me [ L hears my voice ] . ”
EXB	John	18	30	They answered , “ If he were not a ·criminal [ L evildoer ] , we wouldn ’ t have brought him to you. ”
EXB	John	18	31	Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law. ” “ But ·we are not allowed [ it is not legal for us ] to put anyone to death , ” the Jews answered . [ C The Jewish people had to concede the authority for capital punishment to their Roman occupiers . ]
EXB	John	18	32	( This happened so that what Jesus said about how he would die [ C by crucifixion rather than stoning ] would ·come true [ L be fulfilled ; see 12:32–33 ] . )
EXB	John	18	33	Then Pilate went back inside the ·palace [ headquarters ; L Praetorium ] and called Jesus to him and asked , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
EXB	John	18	34	Jesus ·said [ answered ] , “ Is that your own question , or did others tell you about me ? ”
EXB	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ ·I am not one of you [ L Am I a Jew ? ] . It was your own ·people [ nation ] and their ·leading [ T chief ] priests who ·handed you over [ or betrayed you ] to me . What have you done wrong ? ”
EXB	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom ·does not belong to [ T is not of ] this world . If it belonged to this world , my servants would have fought to keep me from being ·given over [ betrayed ; handed over ] to the ·Jewish leaders [ L Jews ] . But my kingdom is from another place. ”
EXB	John	18	38	Pilate said , “ What is truth ? ” After he said this , he went out to the ·crowd [ L Jews ] again and said to them , “ I find ·nothing [ no case ; no basis for a charge ] against this man .
EXB	John	18	39	But it is your custom that I ·free [ release ] one prisoner to you at Passover time . Do you want me to ·free [ release ] the ‘ king of the Jews ’ ? ”
EXB	John	18	40	They shouted back , “ No , not him ! Let Barabbas ·go free [ be released ] ! ” ( Barabbas was a ·robber [ bandit ; revolutionary ; terrorist ; C the Romans referred to insurrectionists as “ robbers ” or “ criminals ” ] . )
EXB	John	19	19	Pilate wrote a ·sign [ title ; notice ; inscription ] and ·put [ fastened ] it on the cross . It read : jesus ·of nazareth [ L the Nazarene ] , the king of the jews .
EXB	John	19	2	The soldiers ·made [ wove ; twisted together ] a crown ·from some thorny branches [ T of thorns ] and put it on Jesus ’ head and put a purple robe [ C purple was the color of royalty ] around him .
EXB	John	19	3	Then they came to him many times and said , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” and ·hit him in the face [ slapped/struck him ] .
EXB	John	19	4	Again Pilate came out and said to them , “ Look , I am bringing Jesus out to you . I want you to know that I find ·nothing [ no case ; no basis for a charge ] against him. ”
EXB	John	19	5	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ ·Here is the man [ T Behold the man ] ! ”
EXB	John	19	6	AM ] on Preparation Day of Passover week . Pilate said to ·the crowd [ L the Jews ] , “ ·Here is your king ! [ L Look , your king ! or Look at your king ! ] ”
EXB	John	19	7	The ·leaders [ Jewish leaders ; L Jews ] answered [ L him ] , “ We have a law [ Lev . 24:16 ] that says he should die , because he ·said he is [ made himself ; claimed to be ] the Son of God. ”
EXB	John	19	8	When Pilate heard this [ L statement ; word ] , he was even more afraid .
EXB	John	19	9	He went back inside the ·palace [ headquarters ; L Praetorium ] and asked Jesus , “ Where do you come from ? ” But Jesus did not answer him .
EXB	John	19	10	Pilate said [ L to him ] , “ You refuse to speak to me ? Don ’ t you know I have ·power [ authority ] to ·set you free [ release you ] and ·power [ authority ] to have you crucified ? ”
EXB	John	19	11	Jesus answered [ him ] , “ The only ·power [ authority ] you have over me is the ·power [ authority ] given to you ·by God [ L from above ] . The man who ·turned me in to you [ betrayed me ; C Caiaphas or perhaps Judas ] is guilty of a greater sin. ”

EXB	John	19	14	It was about ·noon [ L the sixth hour ; C hours were counted from dawn , about
EXB	John	19	15	They shouted , “ Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to crucify your king ? ” The ·leading [ T chief ] priests answered , “ The only king we have is Caesar. ”
EXB	John	19	16	So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified . Jesus Is Crucified ( A ) The soldiers took charge of Jesus .
EXB	John	19	17	Carrying his own cross , Jesus went out to a place called The Place of the Skull , which in the Hebrew [ C Aramaic ; see v.
EXB	John	19	18	There they crucified Jesus . They also crucified two other men , one on each side , with Jesus in the middle .
EXB	John	19	20	The ·sign [ title ; notice ; inscription ] was written in Hebrew [ C Aramaic ; 19:13 ] , in Latin , and in Greek [ C the languages spoken in Jerusalem at the time ] . Many of the people read the sign , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city .
EXB	John	19	21	The ·leading [ T chief ] priests [ L of the Jews ] said to Pilate , “ Don ’ t write , ‘ The King of the Jews. ’ But write , ‘ This man ·said [ claimed ] , “ I am the King of the Jews. ” ’ ”
EXB	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
EXB	John	19	23	After the soldiers crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts , with each soldier getting one part [ C it was a custom that the executioners would get the victim ’ s clothes ] . They also took his ·long shirt [ tunic ; undergarment ] , which was ·all one piece of cloth [ seamless ] , woven from top to bottom .
EXB	John	19	24	So the soldiers said to each other , “ We should not tear this into parts . Let ’ s throw lots [ C similar to dice ] to see who will get it. ” This happened so that this Scripture would come true : “ They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for my clothing [ Ps . 22:18 ] . ” So the soldiers did this .
EXB	John	19	25	[ L Now ] Standing near his cross were Jesus ’ mother , his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene . [ C It is unclear whether Mary the wife of Clopas is the same as Jesus ’ mother ’ s sister or someone else . ]
EXB	John	19	26	When Jesus [ L therefore ] saw his mother and the ·follower [ disciple ] he loved [ C probably John himself ] standing nearby , he said to his mother , “ ·Dear woman [ L Woman ; see 2:4 ] , ·here is [ T behold ] your son. ”
EXB	John	19	27	Then he said to the ·follower [ disciple ] , “ ·Here is [ T Behold ] your mother. ” From that time on , the ·follower [ disciple ] took her to live in his home . Jesus Dies ( B )
EXB	John	19	28	After this , Jesus knew that everything had been ·done [ finished ; completed ] . So that the Scripture would ·come true [ be fulfilled ] , he said , “ I ·am thirsty [ T thirst ; Ps . 22:15 ; 69:21 ] . ”
EXB	John	19	29	There was a jar full of ·vinegar [ sour wine ] there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it , put the sponge on a ·branch [ stalk ] of a hyssop plant , and lifted it to Jesus ’ mouth .
EXB	John	19	30	When Jesus ·tasted [ L received ] the ·vinegar [ sour wine ] , he said , “ It is ·finished [ completed ; accomplished ] . ” Then he bowed his head and ·died [ L gave up/yielded his spirit ] .
EXB	John	19	31	This day was Preparation Day [ C for the celebration of Passover ; 12:12 ] , and the next day was a ·special [ high ; L great ] Sabbath day [ C special because it occurred during Passover ] . Since the ·religious leaders [ L Jews ] did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day , they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken [ C so they would die quicker ] and the bodies be taken away [ Deut . 21:22–23 ] .
EXB	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man on the cross beside Jesus . Then they broke the legs of the man on the other cross beside Jesus .
EXB	John	19	33	But when the soldiers came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
EXB	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers ·stuck [ pierced ] his ·spear [ lance ; javelin ] into Jesus ’ side , and at once blood and water came out [ C indicating his death as a human being ] .
EXB	John	19	35	( The one who saw this happen is the one who ·told us this [ witnesses ; testifies ; C again probably an allusion to the disciple John ] , and ·whatever he says [ his witness/testimony ] is true . And he knows that he tells the truth , and he tells it so that you might believe [ see 21:24 ] . )
EXB	John	19	36	[ L For ] These things happened to ·make the Scripture come true [ fulfill the Scripture ] : “ Not one of his bones will be broken [ Ps . 34:20 ; see Ex . 12:46 ; Num . 9:12 ] . ”
EXB	John	19	37	And [ L again ] another Scripture says , “ They will look at the one they ·stabbed [ pierced ; Zech . 12:10 ] . ” Jesus Is Buried ( C )
EXB	John	19	38	·Later [ L After these things ] , Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus . ( Joseph was a secret ·follower [ disciple ] of Jesus , because he was afraid of ·some of the leaders [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] . ) Pilate gave his permission , so Joseph came and took Jesus ’ body away .
EXB	John	19	39	Nicodemus , who earlier had come to Jesus at night [ 3:1–15 ; 7:50–52 ] , went with Joseph . He brought about seventy-five pounds [ C Greek : a hundred litrai ; a litra was about
EXB	John	19	40	These two men took Jesus ’ body and wrapped it with the spices in pieces of linen cloth , ·which is how they bury the dead [ L according to the burial custom of the Jews ] .
EXB	John	19	41	In the place where Jesus was crucified , there was a garden . In the garden was a new tomb that had never been used before .
EXB	John	19	42	The men laid Jesus in that tomb because it was nearby , and ·they were preparing to start their Sabbath day [ L because it was the Jewish Day of Preparation ] .
EXB	John	20	20	After he said this , he showed them his hands and his side . His ·followers [ disciples ] ·were thrilled [ rejoiced ] when they saw the Lord .
EXB	John	20	2	she ran to Simon Peter and the ·follower [ disciple ] whom Jesus loved [ C probably John ] . Mary said , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
EXB	John	20	3	So Peter and the other ·follower [ disciple ] started for the tomb .
EXB	John	20	4	They were both running , but the other ·follower [ disciple ] ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .
EXB	John	20	5	He bent down and looked in and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .
EXB	John	20	6	Then following him , Simon Peter arrived and went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen lying there .
EXB	John	20	7	He also saw the [ burial ] cloth that had been around Jesus ’ head , which was ·folded [ or rolled ] up and laid [ by itself ] in a different place from the strips of linen .
EXB	John	20	8	Then the other ·follower [ disciple ] , who had reached the tomb first , also went in . He saw and believed .
EXB	John	20	9	( [ L For ] They did not yet understand from the Scriptures that ·Jesus must rise [ it was necessary for him to rise ] from the dead . ) Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
EXB	John	20	10	Then the ·followers [ disciples ] went back home .
EXB	John	20	11	But Mary stood outside the tomb , ·crying [ weeping ] . As she was ·crying [ weeping ] , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .
EXB	John	20	12	She saw two angels dressed in white , sitting where Jesus ’ body had been , one at the head and one at the feet .
EXB	John	20	13	They asked her , “ Woman , why are you ·crying [ weeping ] ? ” She answered , “ They have taken away my Lord , and I don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
EXB	John	20	14	When Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not ·know [ realize ] it was Jesus .
EXB	John	20	15	Jesus asked her , “ Woman , why are you ·crying [ weeping ] ? Whom are you looking for ? ” Thinking he was the gardener , she said to him , “ ·Did you take him away , sir ? [ L If you took him away , sir… ] Tell me where you put him , and I will get him. ”
EXB	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” Mary turned toward Jesus and said in the Hebrew [ C Aramaic ] language , “ Rabboni [ C a variant of the more common Rabbi ] . ” ( This means “ Teacher. ” )
EXB	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ Don ’ t ·hold on to [ cling to ; or touch ] me , because I have not yet ·gone up [ ascended ] to the Father . But go to my brothers [ C his disciples ] and tell them , ‘ I am ·going back [ ascending ] to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ’ ”
EXB	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene went and said to the ·followers [ disciples ] , “ I saw the Lord ! ” And she told them what Jesus had said to her . Jesus Appears to His Followers ( B )
EXB	John	20	19	When it was evening on the first day of the week , Jesus ’ ·followers [ disciples ] were together . The doors were ·locked [ shut ] , because they were afraid of ·the elders [ the Jewish leaders ; L the Jews ] . Then Jesus came and stood right in the middle of them and said , “ Peace be with you. ”
EXB	John	20	21	Then Jesus said to them again , “ Peace be with you . As the Father sent me , I now send you. ”
EXB	John	20	22	After he said this , he breathed on them [ Gen. 2:7 ] and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
EXB	John	20	23	If you forgive anyone his sins , they are forgiven . If you ·don ’ t forgive them [ withhold forgiveness ; L retain the sins of any ; Matt . 16:19 ; 18:18 ] , they are not forgiven. ” Jesus Appears to Thomas
EXB	John	20	24	Thomas ( called Didymus [ C meaning “ the Twin ” ] ) , who was one of the twelve , was not with them when Jesus came .
EXB	John	20	25	The other ·followers [ disciples ] kept telling Thomas , “ We saw the Lord. ” But Thomas said , “ I will not believe it until I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side. ”
EXB	John	20	26	·A week later [ L After eight days ] the ·followers [ disciples ] were in the house again , and Thomas was with them . The doors were ·locked [ shut ] , but Jesus came in and stood right in the middle of them . He said , “ Peace be with you. ”
EXB	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here , and look at my hands . Put your hand here in my side . Stop ·being an unbeliever [ doubting ] and believe. ”
EXB	John	20	28	Thomas ·said to [ answered ] him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
EXB	John	20	29	Then Jesus told him , “ You believe because you see me . ·Those who believe without seeing me will be truly blessed [ L Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed ] . ” Why John Wrote This Book
EXB	John	20	30	Jesus [ L therefore ] did many other ·miracles [ L signs ; 2:11 ] in the presence of his ·followers [ disciples ] that are not written in this book .
EXB	John	20	31	But these are written so that you may ·believe [ or keep on believing ] that Jesus is the Christ [ C Greek : Christos , for Hebrew Mashiach , the “ anointed one ” ] , the Son of God . Then , by believing , you may have life through his name .
EXB	John	21	21	When Peter saw him behind them , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
EXB	John	21	2	Some of the ·followers [ disciples ] were together : Simon Peter , Thomas ( called Didymus [ C meaning “ the Twin ” ] ) , Nathanael from Cana in Galilee , the two sons of Zebedee [ C James and John ] , and two other ·followers [ disciples ] .
EXB	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going out to fish. ” The others said [ L to him ] , “ We will go with you. ” So they went out and got into the boat . They fished that night but caught nothing .
EXB	John	21	4	·Early the next morning [ Just at daybreak ] Jesus stood on the shore , but the ·followers [ disciples ] did not ·know [ realize ] it was Jesus .
EXB	John	21	5	Then he said to them , “ ·Friends [ L Children ; C a term of endearment ] , did you catch any fish ? ” They answered , “ No. ”
EXB	John	21	6	He said to them , “ Throw your net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some. ” So they did , and they caught so many fish they could not pull the net back into the boat .
EXB	John	21	7	The ·follower [ disciple ] whom Jesus loved [ C John ] said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” [ L So ] When Peter heard him say this , he wrapped his ·coat [ outer garment ] around himself . ( ·Peter had taken his clothes off [ L for he was naked ] . ) Then he jumped into the ·water [ L sea ; lake ] .
EXB	John	21	8	The other ·followers [ disciples ] went to shore in the boat , ·dragging [ towing ] the net full of fish . They were not very far from shore , only about a hundred yards [ L two hundred cubits ] .
EXB	John	21	9	When the ·followers [ disciples ] ·stepped out of the boat and onto the shore [ landed ; disembarked ] , they saw a fire of hot coals . There were fish on the fire , and there was bread .
EXB	John	21	10	Then Jesus said [ L to them ] , “ Bring some of the fish you just caught. ”
EXB	John	21	11	Simon Peter went into the boat and ·pulled [ hauled ] the net to the shore . It was full of big fish , one hundred fifty-three in all , but even though there were so many , the net did not tear .
EXB	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come and ·eat [ or have breakfast ] . ” None of the followers dared ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew it was the Lord .
EXB	John	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them , along with the fish .
EXB	John	21	14	This was now the third time [ C see 20:19–23 ; 20:26–29 ] Jesus ·showed [ revealed ; manifested ] himself to his ·followers [ disciples ] after he was raised from the dead . Jesus Talks to Peter
EXB	John	21	15	and
EXB	John	21	16	Jesus uses a different word for “ love ” ( agapaō ) than Peter uses ( phileō ) ; but then in v.
EXB	John	21	17	Jesus uses Peter ’ s word ( phileō ) . The two terms can be synonymous , and the difference is probably stylistic . The passage is not contrasting two kinds of love ; rather , Peter ’ s three affirmations counterbalance his three denials ; see 18:15–18 , 25–27 ]
EXB	John	21	18	·I tell you the truth [ L Truly , truly I say to you ] , when you were younger , you ·tied your own belt [ dressed yourself ] and went where you wanted . But when you are old , you will put out your hands and someone else will ·tie [ dress ] you and take you where you don ’ t want to go. ”
EXB	John	21	19	( Jesus said this to ·show [ indicate ; signify ] how Peter would die to ·give glory to [ glorify ] God . ) Then Jesus said to Peter , “ Follow me ! ”
EXB	John	21	20	Peter turned and saw that the ·follower [ disciple ] Jesus loved [ C John ] was ·walking behind them [ following ] . ( This was the ·follower [ disciple ] who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said , “ Lord , who will ·turn against [ betray ] you ? ” [ see 13:24–25 ] )
EXB	John	21	22	Jesus answered [ L him ] , “ If I want him to live until I come back , ·that is not your business [ L what is that to you ? ] . You follow me. ”
EXB	John	21	23	So a ·story [ rumor ; report ; saying ; L word ] spread among the ·followers [ disciples ; L brothers ] that this one would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die . He only said , “ If I want him to live until I come back , ·that is not your business [ what is that to you ? ] . ”
EXB	John	21	24	That ·follower [ disciple ] is the one who ·is telling [ witnesses/testifies to ] these things and who has now written them down . We know that ·what he says [ his testimony/witness ] is true .
EXB	John	21	25	There are many other things Jesus did . If every one of them were written down , I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written .

EXB	Romans	1	18	[ L For ] God ’ s ·anger [ wrath ; retribution ] is ·shown [ being revealed ] from heaven against all the ·evil [ ungodly ] and ·wrong [ wicked ; unrighteous ] things people do . By their ·own evil lives [ wickedness ; unrighteousness ] they ·hide [ suppress ] the truth .
EXB	Romans	1	19	God ·shows [ reveals ] his ·anger [ wrath ; retribution ] because ·some knowledge of [ what can be known about ] him has been made ·clear [ plain ; evident ] to them . Yes , God has ·shown himself [ revealed/disclosed it ] to them .
EXB	Romans	1	20	For since the creation of the world , God ’ s invisible qualities—his eternal power and ·all the things that make him God [ his divine nature ] —have been clearly ·seen [ perceived ] , understood through what God has made . So people have no excuse .
EXB	Romans	1	21	They knew God , but they did not give glory to God or thank him . Their thinking became ·useless [ futile ; pointless ] . Their ·foolish [ ignorant ; uncomprehending ] ·minds [ L hearts ] were ·filled with darkness [ darkened ] .
EXB	Romans	1	22	They claimed to be wise , but they became fools .
EXB	Romans	1	23	They ·traded [ exchanged ] the glory of ·God who lives forever [ the immortal/imperishable God ] for the worship of ·idols [ images ] made to look like ·earthly [ mortal ; perishable ] people , birds , animals , and reptiles .
EXB	Romans	1	24	Because they did these things , God ·abandoned them to [ allowed them to pursue ; gave them over to ] ·their sinful desires [ L the desires of their hearts ] , resulting in ·sexual impurity [ L uncleanness ; impurity ] and the dishonoring of their bodies with one another .
EXB	Romans	1	25	They ·traded [ exchanged ] the truth of God for ·a lie [ or the lie ; see Gen. 3:4–5 ] and worshiped and served ·the creation [ or the creature ; or created things ] instead of the Creator , who ·should be praised [ or is blessed ] forever . Amen .
EXB	Romans	1	26	Because people did those things , God ·abandoned them to [ allowed them to pursue ; gave them over to ] ·shameful [ dishonorable ; degrading ] ·lusts [ passions ] . [ L Their ] Women ·stopped having natural sex and started having sex with other women [ L exchanged natural ( heterosexual ) relations for unnatural ones ] .
EXB	Romans	1	27	In the same way , men ·stopped having [ abandoned ] natural ·sex [ L relations with women ] and ·began wanting [ L were inflamed in their lust for ] each other . Men did shameful things with other men , and in ·their bodies [ L themselves ] they received the ·punishment [ recompense ; due penalty ] for ·those wrongs [ their error ] .
EXB	Romans	1	28	[ L And since/just as ] People did not ·think it was important [ consider it worthwhile ; see fit ] to ·have a true knowledge of [ or acknowledge ] God . So God ·abandoned them to [ allowed them to pursue ; gave them over to ] ·their own worthless thinking [ a depraved/corrupted mind ] to do things they should not do .
EXB	Romans	1	29	They are filled with every kind of ·sin [ unrighteousness ; injustice ] , ·evil [ wickedness ] , ·selfishness [ greed ] , and ·hatred [ evil ; malice ; depravity ] . They are full of ·jealousy [ envy ] , murder , ·fighting [ strife ; quarreling ] , ·lying [ deceit ; treachery ] , and ·thinking the worst about each other [ spite ; maliciousness ] .

EXB	Romans	1	30	and ·say evil things about each other [ slanderers ; backstabbers ] . They hate God . They are ·rude [ insolent ; haughty ] and ·conceited [ proud ; arrogant ] and ·brag about themselves [ boastful ] . They invent ways of doing evil . They do not ·obey [ respect ] their parents .
EXB	Romans	1	31	They are ·foolish [ senseless ; undiscerning ] , they ·do not keep their promises [ or are covenant-breakers ] , and they show no ·kindness [ love ; affection ] or ·mercy [ pity ] to others .

We receive forgiveness through faith in ·the blood of Jesus ’ death [ L his blood ] . This showed ·that God always does what is right and fair [ L his righteousness ] , as in the past when he was patient and ·did not punish people for their sins [ L passed over/delayed punishment for previously committed sins ] .
EXB	Romans	3	26	And God gave Jesus to show ·today [ or at this present time ( of salvation ) ] ·that he does what is right [ L his righteousness/justice ] .

So they must trust in him [ L But for the one who does not work , but trusts in God ] , who ·makes even evil people right in his sight [ justifies/makes righteous the ungodly ] .

EXB	Romans	4	6	David said the same thing . He said that people are ·truly blessed [ happy ; spiritually fulfilled ] when God , ·without paying attention to their deeds [ apart from works ] , ·makes people right with himself [ L credits/counts righteousness to them ] .
EXB	Romans	4	7	“ ·Blessed [ Happy ; Spiritually fulfilled ] are they whose ·sins [ lawless deeds ] are forgiven , whose ·wrongs [ sins ] are ·pardoned [ covered ; blotted out ] .
EXB	Romans	4	8	·Blessed [ Happy ; Spiritually fulfilled ] is the person whom the Lord does not ·consider guilty [ L count sin against ; Ps . 32:1–2 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	4	9	Is this ·blessing [ happiness ; spiritual fulfillment ] only for those who are circumcised or also for those who are not circumcised ? We have already said that ·God accepted Abraham ’ s faith and that faith made him right with God [ L faith was credited/counted to Abraham for righteousness ; v.
EXB	Romans	4	10	So how did this happen ? Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised ? It was not after , but before his circumcision .
EXB	Romans	4	11	Abraham ·was circumcised [ L received the sign of circumcision ; Gen. 17:9–14 ] ·to show that he was right with God [ L as a seal/guarantee of the righteousness he had ] through faith before he was circumcised . So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised , so that ·they too may be accepted as being right with God [ righteousness may be credited/counted to them also ] .
EXB	Romans	4	12	And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised and who ·live following [ L walk in the footsteps of ] the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised . God Keeps His Promise
EXB	Romans	4	13	[ L For ] The promise Abraham and his ·descendants [ seed ] received that they would inherit the ·whole world [ L world ] ·did not come through [ was not based on his obedience to ] the law , but through ·being right with God by his faith [ the righteousness that comes by faith ] .
EXB	Romans	4	14	[ L For ] If people ·could receive what God promised [ L are heirs ] by following the law , then faith is worthless . And ·God ’ s promise to Abraham [ L the promise ] is ·worthless [ nullified ; canceled ] ,
EXB	Romans	4	15	because the law can only bring God ’ s ·anger [ wrath ] . But if there is no law , there is ·nothing to disobey [ no transgression/violation ; C the law points out sin ( 5:13 ) , but it can not save from sin ] .
EXB	Romans	4	16	So people receive God ’ s promise by having faith . This happens so the promise can be ·a free gift [ by grace ] . Then all of Abraham ’ s ·children [ descendants ; offspring ; L seed ] can ·have [ be guaranteed ; be certain to have ] that promise . It is not only for those who live under the law of Moses but for anyone who lives with faith like that of Abraham , who is the father of us all .
EXB	Romans	4	17	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ I ·am making [ L have made ] you a father of many nations [ Gen. 17:5 ] . ” This is true ·before [ in the presence of ] God , the God Abraham believed , the God who gives life to the dead and who ·creates something out of nothing [ L calls things that did not exist into existence ] .
EXB	Romans	4	18	·Though there was no hope that Abraham would have children [ or When all seemed hopeless ; L Against hope… ] , Abraham believed God and continued hoping , and so he became the father of many nations [ Gen. 17:5 ] . As God told him , “ ·Your descendants also will be too many to count [ L So shall your seed/offspring be ; Gen. 15:5 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	4	19	Abraham was almost a hundred years old , ·much past the age for having children [ L his own body ( as good as ) dead ] , and ·Sarah could not have children [ L Sarah ’ s womb was dead ] . Abraham ·thought about all [ considered ; or acknowledged ] this , but his faith in God did not become weak .
EXB	Romans	4	20	He never ·doubted or stopped believing [ or wavered through unbelief ] that God would keep his promise . He grew stronger in his faith and gave ·praise [ glory ] to God .
EXB	Romans	4	21	Abraham ·felt sure [ was fully convinced ] that God was able to do what he had promised .
EXB	Romans	4	22	So , “ ·God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God [ L it was credited/counted to him for righteousness ; Gen. 15:6 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	4	23	Those words ( “ ·God accepted Abraham ’ s faith [ L it was credited/counted to him ] ” ) were written not only for Abraham
EXB	Romans	4	24	but also for us . ·God will accept us also [ L …to whom it will be credited/counted ] because we believe in the One who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead .
EXB	Romans	4	25	Jesus was ·given to die [ handed/delivered over ; 8:32 ] ·for [ because of ] our ·sins [ violations ; transgressions ] , and he was raised from the dead ·to make us right with God [ for our justification ; or to confirm our justification ] .
EXB	Romans	5	5	And this hope will never ·disappoint us [ let us down ; or put us to shame ; dishonor us ; C honor and shame were among the most important values in first century culture ] , because God has ·poured out his love to fill our hearts [ or flooded our hearts with his love ] . He gave us his love through the Holy Spirit , whom God has given to us .
EXB	Romans	5	2	·who through our faith [ b ] has brought us into that blessing of [ L through whom we have access by faith to ] God ’ s grace ·that we now enjoy [ L in which we stand/live ] . And we ·are happy [ rejoice ; boast ] because of the hope we have ·of sharing [ or of experiencing ; L of ] God ’ s glory .
EXB	Romans	5	3	[ L Not only this , but ] We also ·have joy [ rejoice ; boast ] ·with our troubles [ through suffering/trials/persecution ] , because we know that ·these troubles [ suffering ; trials ; persecution ] produce ·patience [ endurance ] .
EXB	Romans	5	4	And ·patience [ endurance ] produces [ tested and proven ] character , and [ tested and proven ] character produces hope .
EXB	Romans	5	6	[ L For ] When we were ·unable to help ourselves [ L still helpless/weak ] , at the ·right [ or appointed ] time , Christ died for ·us sinners [ L the ungodly/wicked ] .
EXB	Romans	5	7	·Very few people will [ or Rarely/Scarcely will anyone ] die for a ·righteous [ just ; pious ] person . Although perhaps for a ·good [ truly good ; noble ] person someone might possibly die [ C the “ righteous ” person may be someone who is outwardly religious , while the “ good ” person is genuinely generous and loving ] .
EXB	Romans	5	8	But God ·shows [ demonstrates ; proves ] his ·great [ L own ] love for us in this way : Christ died for us while we were still sinners .
EXB	Romans	5	9	And since we have now been ·made right with God [ declared righteous ; justified ] by ·the blood of Christ ’ s death [ L his blood ] , ·we will surely also [ L how much more shall we… ! ] be saved through Christ from ·God ’ s anger [ final punishment ; L the wrath ] .
EXB	Romans	5	10	[ L For if ] While we were God ’ s enemies , ·he made us his friends [ L we were reconciled to God ] through the death of his Son . ·Surely [ L How much more… ? ] , ·now that we are his friends [ L having been reconciled ] , he will save us through his Son ’ s life .
EXB	Romans	5	11	And not only that , but now we ·are also very happy [ also rejoice/boast ] in God through our Lord Jesus Christ . Through him we ·are now God ’ s friends again [ have now received reconciliation ] . Adam and Christ Compared
EXB	Romans	5	12	[ L Therefore , just as ] Sin came into the world ·because of what one man did [ L through one man ] , and with sin came death . ·This is why [ L …and so ; or and in this way ] ·everyone must die [ death spread/passed to all people ] —because everyone sinned .
EXB	Romans	5	13	Sin was in the world before ·the law of Moses [ L the law ] , but sin is not ·counted against us as breaking a command [ charged to one ’ s account ; recorded as sin ] when there is no law [ 4:15 ] .
EXB	Romans	5	14	But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , ·everyone had to die [ L death reigned/ruled ] , even those who had not sinned ·by breaking a command , as Adam had [ L in the likeness of Adam ’ s disobedience/transgression ] . Adam was ·like [ a type/pattern/prefigurement of ] the One who was coming in the future .
EXB	Romans	5	15	But ·God ’ s free gift [ L the gift ] is not like Adam ’ s ·sin [ violation ; transgression ] . [ L For if ] Many people died because of the ·sin [ violation ; transgression ] of that one man . ·But the grace from God was much greater , since many people received God ’ s gift of life [ L …how much more did God ’ s grace and gift abound/multiply to the many ] by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ [ C the death of the “ one ” saved the “ many ” ; see v.
EXB	Romans	5	19	[ L For just as… ] One man disobeyed God , and many became sinners . ·In the same way , [ L …so also ] one man obeyed God , and many will be made ·right [ righteous ] .
EXB	Romans	5	16	But the gift of God is different from ·Adam ’ s [ L the one man ’ s ] sin . After Adam sinned once , ·he was judged guilty [ L his judgment brought condemnation ] . [ L But ] God ’ s free gift came after many ·sins [ violations ; transgressions ] , and it ·makes people right with God [ L brought justification ] .
EXB	Romans	5	17	[ L For if ] One man ’ s ·sin [ violation ; transgression ] caused death to ·rule over all people [ L reign ; rule ] because of that one man . How much more , then , will those people who ·accept [ receive ] ·God ’ s full grace [ L the abundance of grace ] and the great gift of ·being made right with him [ righteousness ] ·have true life and rule [ or rule in the future life ; L reign/rule in life ] through the one man , Jesus Christ . [ C Just as death “ ruled ” in Adam , so believers “ rule ” over death through Christ . ]
EXB	Romans	5	18	So as one ·sin of Adam [ L violation ; trangression ] brought ·the punishment of death [ condemnation ] to all people , so too one ·good act that Christ did [ L righteous act/deed ] ·makes all people right with God , bringing them true life [ L brings justification of life to all people ] .
EXB	Romans	5	20	The law came ·to make sin worse [ or to reveal the true extent of sin ; L to increase the violation/transgression ] . But when sin ·grew worse [ increased ; multiplied ] , God ’ s grace ·increased [ multiplied/abounded all the more ] .
EXB	Romans	5	21	·Sin once used death to rule us [ L Just as sin reigned in death… ] , ·but God gave people more of his grace so that grace could rule [ L …so grace will reign ] ·by making people right with him [ through justification/righteousness ] . And this brings ·life forever [ eternal life ] through Jesus Christ our Lord .

EXB	Romans	6	5	Christ died , and we have been ·joined with [ united with ; grafted into ] him ·by dying too [ or by participating in his death ; L in the likeness of his death ] . So we will also be ·joined with [ united with ; grafted into ] him by rising from the dead as he did .
EXB	Romans	6	7	Anyone who has died is ·made free [ justified ; declared righteous ] from ·sin ’ s control [ L sin ] .
EXB	Romans	6	8	[ L Now ; But ] If we died with Christ , we ·know [ have confidence ; believe ] we will also live with him .
EXB	Romans	6	9	Christ was raised from the dead , and we know that he can not die again . Death has no ·power [ mastery ; dominion ] over him now .
EXB	Romans	6	10	·Yes [ L For ; Because ] , when Christ died , he died ·to defeat the power of sin [ to take away sin ; or with reference to sin ] ·one time—enough for all time [ once for all ; Heb . 7:27 ] . [ L But ] He now has a new life , and his new life is ·with [ or for the glory of ; or with reference to ] God .
EXB	Romans	6	11	In the same way , you should ·see [ count ; consider ] yourselves as being dead to ·the power of sin [ L sin ] and alive ·with [ to ; with reference to ] God ·through [ or in ; in union with ] Christ Jesus .
EXB	Romans	6	12	So , do not let sin ·control your life [ L reign ; rule over you ] ·here on earth [ L in your mortal body ] so that you ·do what your sinful self wants to do [ L obey/submit to its ( evil/sinful ) desires ] .
EXB	Romans	6	13	Do not offer ·the parts of your body [ or any part of yourself ; L your parts/members ] to serve sin , as ·things to be used in doing [ L instruments/weapons of ] ·evil [ unrighteousness ; injustice ] . Instead , offer yourselves to God as people who have died and now live . Offer ·the parts of your body [ or every part of yourself ; L your parts/members ] to God ·to be used in doing good [ L as instruments/weapons of righteousness/justice ] .
EXB	Romans	6	14	[ L For ] Sin will not ·be your master [ exercise dominion/power over you ] , because you are not under law but under God ’ s grace . Be Slaves of Righteousness
EXB	Romans	6	15	·So what should we do [ L What then ; 3:9 ] ? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law ? ·No [ Absolutely not ; May it never be ; v.
EXB	Romans	6	16	·Surely you know [ L Don ’ t you know… ? ] that when you submit yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , ·the person you obey is your master [ L you are slaves to the one you obey ] . [ L Either ] You can ·follow [ be slaves to ] sin , which brings ·spiritual death [ L death ] , or you can ·obey God [ L ( be slaves ) to obedience ] , which ·makes you right with him [ leads to righteousness ] .
EXB	Romans	6	17	In the past ·sin controlled you [ L you were slaves to sin ] . But thank God , you ·fully obeyed [ L obeyed from the heart ] the ·things [ accepted/orthodox teaching ; L example/pattern of teaching ] ·that you were taught [ or that have claimed your allegiance ; L to which you were delivered/entrusted ] .
EXB	Romans	6	18	You were set free from sin , and now you are slaves to ·goodness [ righteousness ] .
EXB	Romans	6	19	I use ·this example [ or an analogy from everyday life ; or an inadequate human illustration ( like slavery ) ] because ·this is hard for you to understand [ L of the limitations/weakness of your human nature/flesh ] . In the past you offered ·the parts of your body [ or yourselves ; L your parts/members ] to be slaves to ·sin [ impurity ; defilement ] and ·evil [ lawlessness ; wickedness ] ; ·you lived only for evil [ or …leading to even more lawlessness/wickedness ] . In the same way now you must offer ·yourselves [ L your parts/members ] to be slaves of ·goodness [ righteousness ] . ·Then you will live only for God [ L …leading to holiness/sanctification ] .
EXB	Romans	6	20	[ L For ] When you were slaves to sin , ·goodness did not control you [ L you were free ( from obligation ) to righteousness ] .
EXB	Romans	6	21	And what ·was the result of [ benefit/fruit did you reap from ] doing those things that now make you ashamed ? [ L For ] ·Those things only bring [ L The end/result of those things is ] death .
EXB	Romans	6	22	But now you are free from sin and have become slaves of God . This ·brings you [ reaps the benefit/fruit of ] ·a life that is only for God [ holiness ; sanctification ] , and ·this gives you life forever [ L the end/result is eternal life ] .
EXB	Romans	6	23	[ L For ; Because ] The ·payment [ wages ] for sin is death . But God gives us the free gift of ·life forever [ eternal life ] in Christ Jesus our Lord .
EXB	Romans	7	7	] ! Sin used something that is good to bring death to me . This happened so that ·I could see what sin is really like [ L sin might be shown as sin ] ; the command was used to show that sin is ·very evil [ exceedingly/terribly sinful ] . The War Within Us
EXB	Romans	7	2	For example , a ·woman must stay married [ L married woman is bound by law ] to her husband as long as he is alive . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law of marriage .
EXB	Romans	7	3	But if she ·marries [ or lives with ] another man while her husband is still alive , ·the law says she is guilty of adultery [ L she will be called/labeled an adulteress ] . But if her husband dies , she is free from the ·law of marriage [ L law ] . Then if she marries another man , she is not ·guilty of adultery [ L an adulteress ] .
EXB	Romans	7	4	In the same way , my brothers and sisters , ·your old selves died , and you became free from the law [ L you died to the law ] through the body of Christ . This happened so that you might belong to someone else—the One who was raised from the dead—and so that we might ·be used in service to [ L bear fruit for ] God .
EXB	Romans	7	5	[ L For ] When we were ·ruled by [ controlled by ; living in ; L in ] ·our sinful selves [ our sinful nature ; T the flesh ] , sinful ·desires [ passions ] stirred up by the law were at work ·in our bodies [ or within us ; L in our members/parts ] , so the things we did ·were bringing us [ L produced fruit leading to ] death .
EXB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been freed from the law , since we have died to that which ·held us like prisoners [ controlled us ; L held us ] . So now we serve God in a new way ·with [ by means of ; in the power of ] the Spirit , and not in the old way ·with written rules [ or of the written law ; L of the letter ] . Our Fight Against Sin
EXB	Romans	7	8	] to ·fool [ deceive ] me by using the command to make me die .
EXB	Romans	7	9	I was alive ·before I knew [ or before I recognized the demands of ; L apart from ] the law [ C Paul thought he was righteous ; see Phil . 3:6 ] . But when the law ’ s command ·came to me [ or came to my attention ; L came ] , then sin ·began to live [ sprang to life ] , and I died [ C the law revealed Paul ’ s sinfulness and confirmed he was spiritually dead ] .
EXB	Romans	7	10	The command was meant to bring life , but for me it brought death .
EXB	Romans	7	11	Sin ·found a way [ seized the occasion/opportunity ; v.
EXB	Romans	7	12	So the law is holy , and the command is holy and ·right [ righteous ] and good .
EXB	Romans	7	13	Does this mean that something that is good ·brought [ or became ] death to me ? No [ Absolutely not ; May it never be ; v.
EXB	Romans	7	14	[ L For ] We know that the law is spiritual , but I am ·not spiritual [ fleshly ; carnal ] ·since sin rules me as if I were its slave [ L sold to sin ; C as a slave ] .
EXB	Romans	7	15	[ L For ] I do not understand the things I do . [ L For ] I do not do what I want to do , and I do the things I hate .
EXB	Romans	7	16	And if I do what I do not want to do , that means I agree that the law is good [ C Paul ’ s acknowledgement that his behavior is wrong confirms the law ’ s righteous standards ] .
EXB	Romans	7	17	But [ L now ] I am not really the one who is doing these hated things ; it is sin living in me that does them .
EXB	Romans	7	18	·Yes [ L For… ] , I know that nothing good lives in me—I mean nothing good lives in ·the part of me that is earthly and sinful [ my sinful self ; my sinful nature ; T my flesh ] . [ L For ] I want to do the things that are good , but I ·do not [ or can not ] do them .
EXB	Romans	7	19	[ L For ] I do not do the good things I want to do , but I do the ·bad [ evil ] things I do not want to do .
EXB	Romans	7	20	So if I do things I do not want to do , then I am not the one doing them . It is sin living in me that does those things .
EXB	Romans	7	21	So I ·have learned this rule [ or find this principle/law at work ] : When I want to do good , evil is ·there with me [ present within me ; close at hand ] .
EXB	Romans	7	22	[ L For ] In ·my mind [ my inmost self ; L the person within ] , I ·am happy with [ delight in ] God ’ s law .
EXB	Romans	7	23	But I see ·another law [ a different standard ; or another power ] working in my ·body [ or outward actions ; L members ; parts ] , which makes war against the ·law [ standards ] that my mind accepts . That other ·law [ standard ; or power ] working in my ·body [ or outward actions ; L members ; parts ] is the law of sin , and it makes me its prisoner .
EXB	Romans	7	24	What a ·miserable [ wretched ] man I am ! Who will ·save [ free ; rescue ; deliver ] me from this ·body that brings me death [ body doomed to die ; or burden of death ] ?
EXB	Romans	7	25	·I thank God for saving me [ L Thanks be to God ! ] through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So [ L then ] in my mind I am a slave to God ’ s law , but in my ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] I am a slave to the ·law [ principle ; or power ] of sin .
EXB	Romans	8	8	Those people who are ·ruled by [ or under the control of ; L in ] ·their sinful selves [ their sinful nature ; T the flesh ] can not please God .
EXB	Romans	8	2	[ L For ] ·Through [ or In ] Christ Jesus the ·law [ principle ; or power ] of the Spirit that brings life set you [ b ] free from the ·law [ principle ; or power ] that brings sin and death .
EXB	Romans	8	3	; Eccl . 1:2 ] , not by its own wish but because God ·wanted [ L subjected ] it ·and because all along there was this hope [ yet with the hope… ] :
EXB	Romans	8	4	He did this so that ·we could be the kind of people that the law demands that we be [ L the law ’ s righteous/just requirements would be fulfilled in us ] . Now we do not ·live [ walk ; C life ’ s journey ] following our ·sinful selves [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] , but following the Spirit .
EXB	Romans	8	5	Those who live following their ·sinful selves [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] ·think only about [ have their minds set on ; or have their outlook shaped by ] things that their ·sinful selves [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] want . But those who live following the Spirit ·are thinking about [ have their minds set on ; or have their outlook shaped by ] the things ·the Spirit wants them to do [ L of the Spirit ] .
EXB	Romans	8	6	If people ’ s ·thinking is controlled by [ or outlook/mind is set on ] the ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] , ·there is [ the result is ] death . But if their ·thinking is controlled by [ or outlook/mind is set on ] the Spirit , ·there is [ the result is ] life and peace .
EXB	Romans	8	7	When people ’ s ·thinking is controlled by [ or outlook/mind is set on ] the ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] , they are ·against [ hostile to ] God , because they refuse to ·obey [ submit to ] God ’ s law and really are not even able to ·obey [ submit to ] God ’ s law .
EXB	Romans	8	9	But you are not ·ruled by [ controlled by ; or in ] ·your sinful selves [ your sinful nature ; T the flesh ] , but ·by [ or in ] the Spirit , if that Spirit of God really lives in you . But the person who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ .
EXB	Romans	8	10	Your body ·will always be [ L is ] dead because of sin . But if Christ is in you , then the Spirit ·gives you [ L is ] life , because ·Christ made you right with God [ L of righteousness ] .
EXB	Romans	8	11	God raised Jesus from the dead , and if God ’ s Spirit is living in you , the One who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies that die , through [ c ] his Spirit who lives in you .
EXB	Romans	8	12	So , my brothers and sisters , we ·must not be ruled by [ L are not obligated to ] ·our sinful selves [ our sinful nature ; T the flesh ] or live ·the way our sinful selves want [ according to the sinful nature/T flesh ] .
EXB	Romans	8	13	[ L For ] If you ·use your lives to do the wrong things your sinful selves want [ L live according to the flesh ] , you will ·die spiritually [ L die ] . But if you ·use the Spirit ’ s help to [ L by the Spirit ] ·stop doing the wrong things you do with [ L put to death the deeds of ] your body , you will ·have true life [ L live ] .
EXB	Romans	8	14	For all those who are led by the Spirit of God are the ·children [ or sons ] of God .
EXB	Romans	8	15	·The Spirit you received does not make you slaves again to fear [ or You did not receive the spirit of slavery , leading to fear ] ; instead , you received the Spirit ·who adopts you as God ’ s children [ L of adoption ] . ·With [ Through ] that Spirit we cry out , “ Abba [ C Aramaic for “ Father ” ; Mark 14:36 ] , Father. ”
EXB	Romans	8	16	And the Spirit himself ·joins with [ or testifies to ] our spirits to say we are God ’ s children .
EXB	Romans	8	17	If we are God ’ s children , we ·will receive blessings from God together with Christ [ L are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ ] . ·But we must [ L …if indeed we ] ·suffer as Christ suffered [ share in his sufferings ] so that we ·will have glory as Christ has glory [ may share in his glory ] . Our Future Glory
EXB	Romans	8	18	[ L For I consider that ] The sufferings we have now are nothing compared to the great glory that will be ·shown [ revealed ] to us .
EXB	Romans	8	19	·Everything God made [ L The creation ] is waiting with ·excitement [ eager expectation ] for ·God to show his children ’ s glory completely [ the revelation of the children/sons of God ] .
EXB	Romans	8	20	·Everything God made [ L For the creation ] was ·changed to become useless [ subjected to futility/meaninglessness ; Gen.
EXB	Romans	8	21	that ·everything God made [ the creation itself ] would be set free from ·ruin [ inevitable decay ; L the slavery of decay ] to have the ·freedom and glory [ or glorious freedom ] that belong to God ’ s children .
EXB	Romans	8	22	We know that ·everything God made [ all creation ] has been ·waiting until now in pain , like a woman ready to give birth [ L groaning with labor pains until now ] .
EXB	Romans	8	23	Not only the world , but we also ·have been waiting with pain inside us [ L groan within ourselves ] . We have the Spirit as the ·first part of God ’ s promise [ L firstfruits ; C as the first crops confirmed the future harvest , so the Spirit ’ s presence confirms believers ’ final salvation ] . So we are [ eagerly ] waiting for ·God to finish making us his own children [ L our adoption ] , which means ·our bodies will be made free [ L the redemption of our bodies ] .
EXB	Romans	8	24	We were saved , ·and we have this hope [ or …by this hope ; L in hope ] . If we see what we are waiting for , that is not really hope . ·People do not hope [ L For who hopes… ? ] for something they already have .
EXB	Romans	8	25	But we are hoping for something we do not have yet , and we are waiting for it ·patiently [ with perseverance ] .
EXB	Romans	8	26	·Also [ or In the same way ] , the Spirit helps us ·with [ or in ] our weakness . We do not know ·how to pray as we should [ or what we ought to pray for ] . But the Spirit himself ·speaks to God for us [ intercedes ] with ·deep feelings [ L groanings ] ·that words can not explain [ or that are inexpressible ; or that are unspoken ; or too deep for words ] .
EXB	Romans	8	27	·God can see what is in people ’ s hearts and [ L The one who searches hearts ] knows what is in the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit ·speaks to God [ intercedes ; appeals ] for ·his people [ or his holy people ; T the saints ] ·in the way God wants [ or in harmony with God ; L according to God ] .
EXB	Romans	8	28	We know that ·in everything God works [ or God works everything together ; or everything works together ( see text note ) ] for the good of those who love him . [ d ] They are the people he called , ·because that was his plan [ L …according to his purpose ] .
EXB	Romans	8	29	·God knew them before he made the world [ L For those whom he foreknew… ] , ·and he chose them [ …he also predestined/chose beforehand ] to be ·like [ molded to the pattern of ; conformed to the image of ] his Son so that Jesus would be the firstborn [ C the preeminent one , but also indicating others will follow ] of many brothers and sisters [ C Jesus ’ resurrection confirms that his followers will also share in God ’ s glory ] .
EXB	Romans	8	30	And those God ·chose to be like his Son [ predestined ; chose beforehand ] , he also called ; and those he called , he also ·made right with him [ declared righteous ; justified ] ; and those he ·made right [ declared righteous ; justified ] , he also glorified [ C both a past act in Christ , and a future transformation ] . God ’ s Love in Christ Jesus
EXB	Romans	8	31	So what should we say ·about this [ in response to these things ] ? If God is for us , ·no one can defeat us [ L who is against us ? ] .
EXB	Romans	8	32	He did not spare his own Son but ·gave him [ or delivered him over ; C to death ] for us all . So with Jesus , ·God will surely [ how could he not… ? ] give us all things .
EXB	Romans	8	33	Who can ·accuse [ bring an accusation/charge against ] the people God has chosen ? No one , because God is the One who ·makes them right [ declares them righteous ; justifies them ] .
EXB	Romans	8	34	Who can ·say God ’ s people are guilty [ condemn ; pronounce punishment ] ? No one , because Christ Jesus died , but he was also raised from the dead , and now he is on God ’ s right ·side [ hand ; Ps . 110:1 ] , ·appealing to God [ interceding ; pleading ] for us .
EXB	Romans	8	35	·Can anything [ or Who can ] separate us from the love Christ has for us ? Can ·troubles [ trials ; tribulations ] or ·problems [ distress ; hardship ] or ·sufferings [ persecution ] or ·hunger [ famine ] or ·nakedness [ destitution ] or danger or ·violent death [ L sword ] ?
EXB	Romans	8	36	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ For ·you [ your sake ] we are ·in danger of death [ L being put to death ] all the time . ·People think we are worth no more than [ L We were considered like ] sheep ·to be killed [ about to be slaughtered ; Ps . 44:22 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	8	37	But in all these things we are completely victorious through ·God [ or Christ ; L the One ] who showed his love for us .
EXB	Romans	8	38	Yes , I am ·sure [ convinced ] that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor ·ruling spirits [ or heavenly rulers ; or demons ; L rulers ; T principalities ] , nothing ·now [ in the present ] , nothing in the future , no ·powers [ or spiritual powers/authorities ] ,
EXB	Romans	8	39	·nothing above us [ or no powers in the sky ] , ·nothing below us [ or nor powers in the depths ] , nor ·anything else in the whole world [ any created thing ] will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .

EXB	Romans	9	9	God ’ s promise to Abraham was this : “ ·At the right time [ At the appointed time ; or About this time next year ] I will return , and Sarah will have a son [ Gen. 18:10 ,
EXB	Romans	9	2	I have great sorrow and ·always feel much sadness [ unceasing/constant anguish ] .
EXB	Romans	9	3	[ L For ] I would even wish that I were cursed and cut off from ·Christ [ or the Messiah ] ·if that would help [ for the sake of ] my Jewish brothers and sisters , my ·people [ countrymen ; L relatives according to the flesh ] .
EXB	Romans	9	4	They are the people of Israel , God ’ s ·chosen [ L adopted ] children . They ·have seen [ or have ] the glory of God , and they have the ·agreements that God made between himself and his people [ L covenants ] . God gave them the law of Moses and the ·right way of worship [ or temple worship ] and his promises .
EXB	Romans	9	5	·They are the descendants of our great ancestors [ L They have the fathers/patriarchs ] , and ·they are the earthly family into which Christ was born [ or from their descendants the Messiah came ] , ·who is God over all . Praise him forever [ or May God , who is over all , be praised forever ] ! Amen .
EXB	Romans	9	6	It is not that ·God failed to keep his promise to them [ L God ’ s word failed ] . ·But only some of the people of Israel are truly God ’ s people [ L Because not all those ( descended ) from Israel are Israel ] ,
EXB	Romans	9	7	·and only some of Abraham ’ s descendants are true children of Abraham [ L nor are all of Abraham ’ s seed/descendants ( true ) children ] . But God said to Abraham : “ ·The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac [ or Through Isaac your descendants will carry on your name ; Gen. 21:12 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	9	8	This means that ·not all of Abraham ’ s descendants [ L it is not the children of the flesh who ] are God ’ s true children . [ L But ; Rather ] ·Abraham ’ s true children [ L Those counted as Abraham ’ s descendants/seed ] are ·those who become God ’ s children because of the promise God made to Abraham [ L the children of the promise ] .
EXB	Romans	9	14	So what should we say about this ? Is God ·unfair [ unjust ] ? ·In no way [ Absolutely not ! ; May it never be ! ; 7:13 ] .
EXB	Romans	9	10	And that is not all . Rebekah ’ s sons ·had the same father , [ or were conceived at the same time by ] our ·father [ ancestor ; forefather ] Isaac .
EXB	Romans	9	15	[ L For ] God said to Moses , “ I will show ·kindness [ mercy ] to anyone to whom I want to show ·kindness [ mercy ] , and I will show ·compassion [ pity ] to anyone to whom I want to show ·compassion [ pity ; Ex . 33:19 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	9	16	So God ’ s choice does not depend on ·what people want [ human desire ; or human will ] or ·try to do [ effort ; exertion ] , but on God ’ s ·mercy [ kindness ] .
EXB	Romans	9	17	The Scripture says to ·the king of Egypt [ L Pharaoh ] : “ I ·made you king [ L raised you up ] for this reason : to show my power in you so that my name will be ·talked about [ proclaimed ] in all the earth [ Ex . 9:16 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	9	18	So God shows mercy where he wants to show mercy , and he ·makes stubborn [ hardens ] the people he wants to ·make stubborn [ harden ] .
EXB	Romans	9	19	] . ”
EXB	Romans	9	20	·You are only human , and human beings have no right to question God [ L Who are you , a mere human being , to talk back to God ? ] . ·An object [ or A thing molded ] should not ask the ·person who made it [ molder ] , “ Why did you make me like this ? [ Is . 29:16 ; 45:9 ] ”
EXB	Romans	9	21	·The potter can make anything he wants to make [ L Doesn ’ t the potter have authority over the clay ? ] . He can use the same ·clay [ L lump ] to make one ·thing [ vessel ; pot ] for ·special [ honorable ] use and another thing for ·daily [ common ; dishonorable ] use .
EXB	Romans	9	22	·It is the same way with God . He [ L What if he… ? ] wanted to show his ·anger [ wrath ] and to let people see his power . But he ·patiently stayed with [ endured with great patience ] those ·people he was angry with [ L vessels/objects of wrath ] —people who were ·made ready [ prepared ] to be destroyed .
EXB	Romans	9	23	; C in Hosea , a reference to apostate Israel ; here applied to the Gentiles ] . ”
EXB	Romans	9	24	and we are those people whom God called . He called us not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles .
EXB	Romans	9	25	As ·the Scripture [ or God ] says in Hosea : “ I will ·say , ‘ You are my people ’ [ call them ‘ my people ’ ] to those who were not my people . And I will ·show my love [ call her ‘ beloved ’ ] to ·those people [ her ] I did not love [ Hos . 2:1 ,
EXB	Romans	9	26	“ And in the same place where they were called , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called ‘ children of the living God [ Hos . 1:10 ] . ’ ”
EXB	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries out about Israel : “ [ L Though ] The ·people [ L children ; sons ] of Israel are numbered like the grains of sand ·by [ or of ] the sea . But only ·a few of them [ the remnant ] will be saved ,
EXB	Romans	9	28	because the Lord will quickly and completely ·punish the people [ carry out/execute his sentence ; settle his account ] on the earth [ Is . 10:22–23 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	9	29	It is as Isaiah said : “ If the Lord ·All-Powerful [ of Hosts ; of Heaven ’ s Armies ] had not ·allowed a few of our descendants to live [ left us offspring/seed ] , We would have become like Sodom and would resemble Gomorrah [ Is . 1:9 ; C OT cities destroyed by God because of their wickedness ; Gen.
EXB	Romans	9	30	·So what does all this mean [ L What , then , shall we say ] ? Those who are Gentiles ·were not trying to make themselves right with God [ L did not pursue righteousness ] , but they ·were made right with God [ obtained righteousness ] ·because of their faith [ L —that is , a righteousness that is by faith ] .
EXB	Romans	9	31	The people of Israel tried to ·follow [ pursue ] a law ·to make themselves right with God [ L of righteousness ] . But they did not ·succeed [ reach/attain it ] ,
EXB	Romans	9	32	[ L Why ? ] because they tried to make themselves right by ·the things they did [ works ] instead of ·trusting in God to make them right [ L by faith ] . They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble .
EXB	Romans	9	33	As it is written in the Scripture : “ [ L Look ; T Behold ] I will put in ·Jerusalem [ L Zion ; C a poetic term for Jerusalem and symbolizing the nation Israel ] a stone that causes people to stumble , a rock that makes them fall [ Is . 8:14 ] . Anyone who ·trusts [ believes ; has faith ] in him will never be ·disappointed [ put to shame ; disgraced ; Is . 28:16 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	10	[ L For ] We believe with our hearts , and so we ·are made right with God [ are justified ; receive righteousness ] . And we ·declare [ confess ] with our mouths , ·and so we are saved [ leading to salvation ] .
EXB	Romans	10	2	·I can say this about them [ L For I testify about them that… ] : They ·really try to follow God [ L have a zeal for God ] , but ·they do not know the right way [ their zeal is misguided/uninformed/undiscerning ; L not according to knowledge ] .
EXB	Romans	10	3	Because they ·did not know [ or ignored ] the ·way that God makes people right with him [ righteousness of God ] , they ·tried to make themselves right in their own way [ L sought to establish their own righteousness ] . So they did not ·accept God ’ s way of making people right [ L submit to God ’ s righteousness ] .
EXB	Romans	10	4	[ L For ] Christ ·ended [ is the end/culmination/fulfillment of ] the law so that everyone who believes in him may ·be right with God [ have righteousness ] .
EXB	Romans	10	5	[ L For ] Moses writes about ·being made right [ the righteousness attained ] by following the law . He says , “ A person who ·obeys [ L does ] these things will live ·because of [ or by means of ] them [ Lev . 18:5 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	6	But ·this is what the Scripture says about being made right through faith [ L the righteousness by faith says ; C righteousness is personified as speaking ] : “ Don ’ t say ·to yourself [ L in your heart ; Deut . 9:4 ] , ‘ Who will ·go up [ ascend ] into heaven [ Deut . 30:12 ] ? ’ ” ( That means , “ Who will go up to heaven and bring Christ down to earth [ C a reference to the Incarnation , Christ coming to earth as a human being ] ? ” )
EXB	Romans	10	7	“ And do not say , ‘ Who will go down into the ·world below [ or depths ; or place of the dead ; L abyss ; Deut . 30:13 ; Ps . 107:26 ] ? ’ ” ( That means , “ Who will go down and bring Christ up from the dead ? ” ) [ C Such impossible tasks are not needed for our salvation , since Christ already did them for us . ]
EXB	Romans	10	8	·This is what the Scripture says [ L But what does it say ? ] : “ The word is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart [ Deut . 30:14 ; C God ’ s salvation has been brought near through Christ and is received by faith ] . ” That is the ·teaching [ message ; word ] of faith that we ·are telling [ preach ; proclaim ] .
EXB	Romans	10	9	If you ·declare [ confess ] with your mouth , “ Jesus is Lord , ” and if you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead , you will be saved .
EXB	Romans	10	11	As the Scripture says , “ Anyone who ·trusts [ believes ] in him will never be ·disappointed [ or put to shame ; Is . 28:16 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	12	·That Scripture says “ anyone ” because [ L For ] there is no difference between Jews and Gentiles . [ L For ; Because ] The same Lord is the Lord of all and gives ·many blessings [ generously ; ( spiritual ) riches ] to all who trust in him ,
EXB	Romans	10	13	as the Scripture says , “ Anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved [ Joel 2:32 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	14	·But before people can ask the Lord for help , they must believe in him [ L How , then , can they call on one in whom they have not believed ? ] ; and ·before they can believe in him , they must hear about him [ L how can they believe in one of whom they have not heard ? ] ; and ·for them to hear about the Lord , someone must tell them [ L how can they hear without someone preaching to them ? ] ;
EXB	Romans	10	15	and ·before someone can go and tell them , that person must be sent [ L how can they preach unless they are sent ? ] . [ L As ] It is written , “ How ·beautiful [ or welcome ; or timely ] ·is the person [ L are the feet of those ] who comes ·to bring [ proclaiming ; preaching ] good news [ Is . 52:7 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	16	But not ·all the Jews [ L everyone ] ·accepted [ heeded ; obeyed ] the good news . [ L For ] Isaiah said , “ Lord , who believed ·what we told them [ our message/report ; Is . 53:1 ] ? ”
EXB	Romans	10	17	·So [ Thus ; Consequently ] faith comes from ·hearing the Good News [ L hearing ] , and ·people hear the Good News [ hearing comes ; or the message/report arrives ] ·when someone tells them [ through the word/message ] ·about [ or proclaimed by ; L of ] Christ .
EXB	Romans	10	18	But I ask : Didn ’ t ·people [ L they ; C Israel ] ·hear the Good News [ L hear ] ? Yes , they heard—as the Scripture says : “ Their ·message [ voice ] went out to all the earth ; their words ·go everywhere on [ L to the ends of ] the world [ Ps . 19:4 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	19	Again I ask : Didn ’ t ·the people of Israel [ L Israel ] understand ? Yes , they did understand [ C this sentence is implied , but not stated , in the Greek ] . First , Moses says : “ I will use those who are not a nation [ C the Gentiles ] to make you jealous . I will use a nation that ·does not understand [ is foolish/senseless ] to make you angry [ Deut . 32:21 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	20	Then Isaiah is bold enough to say : “ I was found by those who were not ·asking me for help [ seeking/looking for me ] . I ·made myself known [ revealed myself ] to people who were not ·looking for [ asking about/for ] me [ Is . 65:1 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	10	21	But about Israel ·God [ or Isaiah ; L he ] says , “ All day long I ·stood ready to accept [ L held out my hands to ] people who ·disobey [ disbelieve ] and are ·stubborn [ defiant ; rebellious ; Is . 65:2 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	11	,
EXB	Romans	11	2	God has not ·thrown out [ cast away ; rejected ] his people , whom he ·chose [ or knew ] ·long ago [ from the beginning ; L beforehand ] . ·Surely you know [ L Do you not know… ? ] what the Scripture says about Elijah , how he ·prayed [ appealed ; complained ] to God against the people of Israel .
EXB	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , ” he said , “ they have killed your prophets , and they have ·destroyed [ torn/burned down ] your altars . I am the only one left , and now they are ·trying to kill me , too [ seeking my life ;
EXB	Romans	11	1	Kin . 19:18 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	14	·I hope [ …if somehow ] I can make my own ·people [ flesh ] jealous and , in that way , help some of them to be saved .
EXB	Romans	11	4	But what ·answer did God give Elijah [ L was the divine response ] ? He said , “ But I have ·left [ kept for myself ] seven thousand ·people [ or men ] in Israel who have not bowed ·down [ L the knee ] before Baal [
EXB	Romans	11	5	It is the same now . There ·are a few people [ is a remnant ] that God has chosen by his grace .
EXB	Romans	11	6	And if he chose them by grace , it is not ·for the things they have done [ by works ] . If they could be made God ’ s people by ·what they did [ works ] , God ’ s gift of grace would ·not really [ or no longer ] be a gift .
EXB	Romans	11	7	·So this is what has happened [ What follows from this ? L What then ? ] : ·The people of Israel [ L Israel ] did not ·succeed in [ attain ; obtain ; find ] what they were ·striving [ looking ; seeking ] for , but the ·ones God chose [ elect ] did ·succeed [ attain/obtain/find it ] . The ·others [ rest ] were ·made stubborn and refused to listen to God [ L hardened ] .
EXB	Romans	11	8	As it is written in the Scriptures : “ God gave the people a ·dull mind [ L spirit of stupor/insensitivity ] so they could not understand [ Is . 29:10 ] . ” “ He ·closed their eyes so they [ or gave them eyes that ] could not see and ·their ears so they [ or gave them ears that ] could not hear . This continues until today [ Deut . 29:4 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	9	And David says : “ Let their ·own feasts [ L table ] ·trap them and cause their ruin [ L become a snare and a trap ] , becoming a ·stumbling block [ pitfall ] and ·paying them back [ their retribution ] .
EXB	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be ·closed [ L darkened ] so they can not see and their backs be ·forever [ or continually ] ·weak from troubles [ L bent over ; Ps . 69:22–23 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	12	] . But ·the Jews are still God ’ s chosen people , and he loves them very much [ L with regard to election , they are beloved ] because of ·the promises he made to their ancestors [ L the ancestors/fathers/patriarchs ] .
EXB	Romans	11	13	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . ·Since [ or As long as ] I am an apostle to the Gentiles [ Acts 9:15 ; 22:21 ; Gal . 2:8 ] , I ·will make the most of [ glory in ; take pride in ; magnify ] my ministry .
EXB	Romans	11	15	[ L For ] If ·God ’ s rejection of Israel [ L their loss/rejection ] meant he ·became friends with [ was reconciled to ] the world , what will Israel ’ s acceptance mean ? It will be like ·bringing the dead back to life [ life from the dead ] .
EXB	Romans	11	16	If the ·first piece of bread is offered to God [ L firstfruits are holy ; C the dough made from the first crops harvested ] , then the whole ·loaf [ batch ; L lump of dough ] is made holy . If the roots of a tree are holy , then the tree ’ s branches are holy too [ C since Abraham and the patriarchs were God ’ s chosen people , so were their Jewish descendants ] .
EXB	Romans	11	17	It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree [ C symbolizing Israel ] have been broken off . You Gentiles are like the branch of a wild olive tree that has been ·joined [ grafted ] to that first tree . You now share the ·strength and life [ nourishment ; L rich/fat root ] of the first tree [ C the Gentiles now share in the rich blessings promised to Israel through their “ root , ” Abraham and the patriarchs ] .
EXB	Romans	11	18	So do not ·brag about [ boast over ; consider yourselves superior to ] those branches that were broken off . If you ·brag [ boast ] , remember that you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
EXB	Romans	11	19	[ L Then ] You will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I could be ·joined to their tree [ grafted in ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	20	That is true . But those branches were broken off because they ·did not believe [ were unfaithful ] , and you ·continue to be part of the tree only because you believe [ L stand by faith ] . Do not be ·proud [ arrogant ] , but be ·afraid [ in awe ] .
EXB	Romans	11	21	[ L For ] If God did not spare the natural branches , then he will not spare you either .
EXB	Romans	11	22	·So you see [ Notice ; Consider ] that God is kind and also ·very strict [ stern ; severe ; harsh ] . He ·punishes [ is strict/severe/harsh toward ] those who ·stop following him [ have fallen ] . But God is kind to you , if you continue ·following in [ trusting in ; L in ] his kindness . If you do not , you will also be cut off from the tree .
EXB	Romans	11	23	And if ·the Jews [ L they ] ·will believe in God again [ L do not continue in unbelief ] , ·he will accept them back [ L they will be grafted in ] . [ L For ] God is able to ·put them back where they were [ graft them in again ] .
EXB	Romans	11	24	[ L For ] If ·you Gentiles [ you ] were cut off from a wild olive tree and , contrary to nature , ·joined to [ grafted into ] a ·good [ cultivated ] olive tree , how much more will these natural branches [ C Jews presently rejecting the gospel ] be ·joined to [ grafted into ] their own olive tree again .
EXB	Romans	11	25	I ·want you to understand [ L do not want you to be ignorant of ] this ·secret [ mystery ; C something God had not previously disclosed ; Eph . 1:9 ] , brothers and sisters , so you will ·understand that you do not know everything [ not become conceited/arrogant/superior-minded ] : ·Part of Israel has been made stubborn [ or A partial hardening has happened to Israel ] , ·but that will change when [ L until ] the ·complete number [ or appointed number ; L fullness ] of the Gentiles have come ·to God [ or into the kingdom ; L in ] .
EXB	Romans	11	26	And ·that is how [ in this way ; or so it will be that ; or so in the end ] all Israel will be saved . [ L As ; Just as ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ The ·Savior [ Rescuer ; Deliverer ] will come from ·Jerusalem [ L Zion ; C a poetic term for Jerusalem symbolizing the nation Israel ] ; he will take away ·all evil [ wickedness ; godlessness ] from ·the family of Jacob [ L Jacob ; C Abraham ’ s grandson ( renamed “ Israel ” ) , whose sons became the twelve tribes of Israel ; Is . 59:20–21 ] .
EXB	Romans	11	27	And I will make this ·agreement [ covenant ] with those people when I take away their sins [ Is . 27:9 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	28	·The Jews refuse to accept the Good News , so [ L With regard to the Gospel , ] they are God ’ s enemies . ·This has happened to help you who are not Jews [ L …for your sake ; C Israel ’ s rejection resulted in the proclamation of the Good News to the Gentiles ; vv .
EXB	Romans	11	29	·God never changes his mind about the people he calls and the things he gives them [ L For God ’ s gifts and calling are irrevocable ] .
EXB	Romans	11	30	[ L For ] At one time you refused to obey God . But now you have received mercy , because those people refused to obey .
EXB	Romans	11	31	And now the Jews refuse to obey , ·because God showed mercy to you . But this happened so that they also can [ a ] receive mercy from him [ or but this happened so that they also can [ b ] receive mercy from him , because of the mercy God showed to you ] .
EXB	Romans	11	32	God has ·given [ imprisoned ] all people ·over to their stubborn ways [ L to/in disobedience ] so that he can show mercy to all . Praise to God
EXB	Romans	11	33	·Yes [ L O ] , ·how great are [ L the depth of ] ·God ’ s riches and wisdom and knowledge [ or the riches of God ’ s wisdom and knowledge ] ! ·No one can explain [ L How unsearchable are… ] ·the things God decides [ God ’ s judgments ] ·or understand [ L …and untraceable… ! ] his ·ways [ paths ] .
EXB	Romans	11	34	As the Scripture says , “ [ L For ] Who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been ·able to give him advice [ his counselor ; Is . 40:13 ] ? ”
EXB	Romans	11	35	“ ·No one [ L Or who… ? ] has ever given God anything that he must pay back [ Job 41:11 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	11	36	·Yes , God made all things , and everything continues through him and for him [ L Because all things come from him , through him and for him ] . To him be the glory forever ! Amen . Footnotes - Romans 11:31 can Some Greek copies read “ can now. ” - Romans 11:31 can Some Greek copies read “ can now . ”
EXB	Romans	12	12	·Be joyful because you have hope [ L Rejoice in hope ] . ·Be patient [ Endure ] ·when trouble comes [ L in suffering/tribulation ] , and pray ·at all times [ faithfully ; with persistence/perseverance ] .
EXB	Romans	12	2	Do not be ·shaped by [ conformed to ; pressed into a mold by ] this ·world [ age ] ; instead be ·changed within [ transformed ] by ·a new way of thinking [ or changing the way you think ; L the renewing of your mind ] . Then you will be able to ·decide [ discern ; test and approve ] what ·God wants for you [ is God ’ s will ] ; you will know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect .
EXB	Romans	12	3	Because God has given me ·a special gift [ his grace ] , I have something to say to everyone among you . Do not think you are better than you are . [ Instead ] You must ·decide what you really are [ think sensibly ; think with sober discernment ] ·by [ based on ; in accordance with ] the amount of faith God has given you .
EXB	Romans	12	4	[ L For just as ] Each one of us has ·a [ L one ] body with many parts , and these parts all have different ·uses [ functions ] .
EXB	Romans	12	5	In the same way , we are many , but in Christ we are all one body , and each part belongs to all the other ·parts [ L members ] .
EXB	Romans	12	6	We all have different gifts , each of which came because of the grace God gave us . The person who has the gift of prophecy should use that gift ·in agreement with the faith [ or in proportion to their faith ] .
EXB	Romans	12	7	Anyone who has the gift of serving should serve . Anyone who has the gift of teaching should teach .
EXB	Romans	12	8	Whoever has the gift of ·encouraging [ exhorting ] others should ·encourage [ exhort ] . Whoever has the gift of giving to others should give ·freely [ generously ] . Anyone who has the gift of being a leader should ·try hard when he leads [ lead diligently/enthusiastically ] . Whoever has the gift of showing mercy to others should do so with ·joy [ cheerfulness ] .
EXB	Romans	12	9	Your love must be ·real [ sincere ; unhypocritical ] . ·Hate [ Abhor ; Despise ] what is evil , and ·hold on [ cling ] to what is good .
EXB	Romans	12	10	·Love [ Be devoted to ] each other ·like brothers and sisters [ with family/brotherly affection ] . ·Give each other more honor than you want for yourselves [ or Outdo one another in showing honor ; or Be eager to show honor to one another ] .
EXB	Romans	12	11	Do not be ·lazy but work hard [ L lacking in zeal ] , serving the Lord with ·all your heart [ L a fervent/eager/enthusiastic spirit ] .
EXB	Romans	12	13	Share with ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] who need help . ·Bring strangers in need into your homes [ Pursue/Be eager to show hospitality ] .
EXB	Romans	12	14	·Wish good for [ Bless ] those who ·harm [ persecute ] you ; ·wish them well [ bless ] and do not curse them .
EXB	Romans	12	15	·Be happy [ Rejoice ] with those who ·are happy [ rejoice ] , and ·be sad [ weep ] with those who ·are sad [ weep ] .
EXB	Romans	12	16	Live in ·peace [ harmony ] with each other . Do not be ·proud [ arrogant ; haughty ] , but ·make friends with those who seem unimportant [ associate with the humble/those of low social status ; or be willing to do lowly tasks ] . Do not think how ·smart [ wise ; superior ] you are .
EXB	Romans	12	17	·If someone does wrong to you , do not pay him back by doing wrong to him [ L Repay no one evil for evil ] . ·Try to do [ or Consider carefully ] what ·everyone thinks is right [ others view as good/honorable ; L is good/noble before all people ] .
EXB	Romans	12	18	·Do your best to [ L If possible , from your part , ] live in peace with everyone .
EXB	Romans	12	19	My friends , do not ·try to punish others when they wrong you [ take revenge ; avenge yourselves ] , but ·wait for God to punish them with his anger [ L leave room for ( God ’ s ) wrath ] . [ L For ] It is written : “ ·I will punish those who do wrong [ L Vengeance is mine ] ; I will repay them [ Deut . 32:35 ] , ” says the Lord .
EXB	Romans	12	20	But you should do this : “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him a drink . Doing this will be like ·pouring [ heaping ] burning coals on his head [ Prov . 25:21–22 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	12	21	Do not let evil ·defeat [ conquer ; overcome ] you , but ·defeat [ conquer ; overcome ] evil by doing good .
EXB	Romans	13	13	Let us ·live [ walk ] ·in a right way [ properly ; decently ] , like people who belong to the day . We should not have wild parties or get drunk . There should be no ·sexual sins of any kind [ L sexual immorality or debauchery/sensuality ] , no ·fighting [ strife ; quarrels ] or jealousy .
EXB	Romans	13	2	So those who ·are against the government [ rebel/resist the authority ] are really ·against [ resisting ; opposing ] what God has ·commanded [ ordained ; instituted ] . And they will bring ·punishment [ judgment ] on themselves .
EXB	Romans	13	3	[ L For ] Those who do ·right [ good ] do not have to fear the rulers ; only those who do ·wrong [ evil ] fear them . Do you want to be unafraid of the ·rulers [ L authority ] ? Then do what is ·right [ good ] , and they will ·praise [ commend ] you .
EXB	Romans	13	4	The ruler is God ’ s servant ·to help you [ for your good ] . But if you do wrong , then be afraid . ·He has the power to punish [ L For he does not bear the sword in vain ] ; he is God ’ s servant ·to punish [ an avenger for ( God ’ s ) wrath to ] those who do wrong .
EXB	Romans	13	5	So you must ·yield [ submit ; be subject ] to the government , not only because ·you might be punished [ L of wrath ] , but because ·you know it is right [ of ( your ) conscience ] .
EXB	Romans	13	6	This is also why you pay taxes . [ L Because ] Rulers are ·working for God [ God ’ s servants/ministers ] ·and give their time to [ devoting themselves to ] their work .
EXB	Romans	13	7	Pay everyone what you owe them : taxes to those you owe taxes , ·fees [ tolls ] to those you owe ·fees [ tolls ] , ·respect [ reverence ; fear ] to those you owe ·respect [ reverence ; fear ] , and honor to those you owe honor . Loving Others
EXB	Romans	13	8	Do not owe ·people [ L anyone ] anything , except always owe love to each other , because the person who loves others has ·obeyed all [ fulfilled ] the law .
EXB	Romans	13	9	[ L For ] The law says , “ You must not be guilty of adultery . You must not murder anyone . You must not steal . You must not ·want to take your neighbor ’ s things [ covet ; Ex . 20:13–15 ,
EXB	Romans	13	17	; Deut . 5:17–21 ] . ” All these commands and all others are really summed up in this one ·rule [ command ; word ] : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself [ Lev . 19:18 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	13	10	Love never ·hurts [ does wrong/evil to ] a neighbor , so loving is ·obeying all [ fulfilling ] the law .
EXB	Romans	13	11	Do this ·because you know the times in which we live [ L knowing the time/season ] . It is ·now [ or already the ] ·time [ hour ] for you to wake up from your sleep , because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed .
EXB	Romans	13	12	The night [ C a metaphor for the present evil age ] is ·almost finished [ advancing ] , and the day [ C the time of final judgment and reward ] is ·almost here [ near ; or at hand ] . So we should ·stop doing [ put aside ; cast off ] ·things that belong to [ L the deeds/works of ] darkness and ·take up the weapons [ or put on the armor ] ·used for fighting in [ or that belong to ; L of ] the light .
EXB	Romans	13	14	But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and ·forget about satisfying [ or give no opportunity to the desires of ; or don ’ t think about ways to gratify ] ·your sinful self [ the sinful nature ; T the flesh ] .
EXB	Romans	14	14	·I am in the Lord Jesus , and I know [ L I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus ] that there is ·no food that is wrong to eat [ L nothing impure/unclean/defiling in itself ] . But if a person ·believes [ considers ; regards ] something is ·wrong [ impure ; unclean ; defiling ] , that thing is ·wrong [ impure ; unclean ; defiling ] for him .
EXB	Romans	14	2	One person believes it is right to eat all kinds of food . But another , who is weak , believes it is right to eat only vegetables [ C possibly the issue of whether to keep the OT dietary laws , and/or whether to avoid food sacrificed to idols ( see
EXB	Romans	14	1	Cor . 8—10 ) ] .
EXB	Romans	14	3	The one who ·knows that it is right to eat any kind of food [ L eats ; v.
EXB	Romans	14	4	·You can not [ L Who are you to… ? ] judge another person ’ s servant . ·The master decides if the servant is doing well or not [ L Before his own lord/master he stands or falls ] . And the Lord ’ s servant will ·do well [ stand ] because the Lord ·helps him do well [ L can make him stand ] .
EXB	Romans	14	5	Some ·think [ decide ; judge ] that one day is more ·important [ sacred ; holy ] than another , and others think that every day is the same [ C the issue is whether to observe the Jewish Sabbath ] . Let all be ·sure [ fully convinced ] ·in their own mind [ according to their convictions/conscience ] .
EXB	Romans	14	6	Those who ·think one day is more important than other days [ L observe the day ] are doing that for the Lord . And those who ·eat all kinds of food [ L eat ] are doing that for the Lord , ·and [ since ; for ] they give thanks to God . Others who ·refuse to eat some foods [ L do not eat ] do that for the Lord , and they give thanks to God .
EXB	Romans	14	7	[ L For ] We do not live for ourselves , and we do not die for ourselves .
EXB	Romans	14	8	If we live , we are living for the Lord , and if we die , we are dying for the Lord . So living or dying , we belong to the Lord .
EXB	Romans	14	9	The reason Christ died and ·rose from the dead to live again [ L lived ] was so he would be Lord over both the dead and the living .
EXB	Romans	14	10	So why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ ? And why do you ·think you are better than they are [ L despise/look down on your brother or sister ] ? [ L For ] We will all stand before ·God to be judged [ the judgment seat of God ] ,
EXB	Romans	14	11	because it is written in the Scriptures : “ ‘ As surely as I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘ ·Everyone [ L Every knee ] will bow before me ; ·everyone [ L every tongue ] will ·say that I am [ confess ; acknowledge ; or praise ] God [ Is . 45:23 ] . ’ ”
EXB	Romans	14	12	So each of us will ·have to answer [ give an account of ourselves ] to God . Do Not Cause Others to Sin
EXB	Romans	14	13	For that reason ·we should [ or let us ] stop judging each other . We must make up our minds not to ·do anything that will make another Christian sin [ L place a stumbling block or obstacle before a brother or sister ] .
EXB	Romans	14	15	If ·you hurt your brother ’ s or sister ’ s faith [ your brother or sister is distressed/grieved ] because of something you eat , you are ·not really following the way of [ L no longer walking/living in ] love . ·Do not destroy someone ’ s faith by eating food he thinks is wrong , because Christ died for him [ L By your eating do not destroy that one for whom Christ died ! ; C so trivial a matter as food must not negate the tremendous sacrifice Christ made ] .
EXB	Romans	14	16	Do not allow what you think is good to ·become what others say is evil [ be criticized/regarded as evil ; L be slandered/blasphemed ] .
EXB	Romans	14	17	·In the kingdom of God , eating and drinking are not important [ L For the kingdom of God is not ( about ) eating and drinking ] . The important things are ·living right with God [ righteousness ] , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
EXB	Romans	14	18	Anyone who serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God and will be ·accepted [ approved ; respected ] by other people .
EXB	Romans	14	19	So let us try to do what makes peace and ·helps [ builds up ; edifies ] one another .
EXB	Romans	14	20	Do not let the eating of food ·destroy [ tear down ] the work of God . All foods are ·all right to eat [ clean ; ritually undefiled ] , but it is wrong to eat food that causes someone else to ·sin [ stumble ; fall ] .
EXB	Romans	14	21	It is ·better [ good ] not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that will cause your brother or sister to ·sin [ stumble ; fall ] .
EXB	Romans	14	22	Your beliefs about these things should be kept secret between you and God . ·People are happy [ Blessed are those ] ·if they can do what they think is right without feeling guilty [ L who do not condemn themselves concerning issues they have examined and approved ] .
EXB	Romans	14	23	But those who eat something ·without being sure it is right [ while doubting ; with misgivings ] are ·wrong [ condemned ] because they did not believe it was right . Anything that ·is done without believing it is right [ or does not come from faith ] is sin .
EXB	Romans	15	15	But I have written to you very ·openly [ boldly ] about some ·things [ points ; L parts ] I wanted you to remember . I did this because ·God gave me this special gift [ or of the grace God gave me ] :
EXB	Romans	15	2	Cor . 8—9 ] the poor among ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] at Jerusalem .
EXB	Romans	15	3	[ L For ] Even Christ did not live to please himself . It was as the Scriptures said : “ ·When people insult you , it hurts me [ L The insults of those who insulted you have fallen on me ; Ps . 69:9 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	15	4	[ L For ] Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us . The Scriptures give us ·patience [ endurance ] and encouragement so that we can have hope .
EXB	Romans	15	5	May ·the patience and encouragement that come from God [ L the God of patience and encouragement ] ·allow you to live in harmony with each other the way Christ Jesus wants [ or grant you the same attitude with each other that Christ Jesus had ] .
EXB	Romans	15	6	·Then [ L …so that ] ·you will all be joined together and [ L together with one voice/mouth ] you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
EXB	Romans	15	7	Accept each another , just as Christ accepted you . ·This will bring glory to God [ or In this way Christ brought glory to God ; L …to the glory of God ] .
EXB	Romans	15	8	[ L For ] I tell you that Christ became a servant of the ·Jews [ L circumcised ] to ·show [ confirm ] that God ’ s promises to the ·Jewish ancestors [ patriarchs ; fathers ] are true .
EXB	Romans	15	9	And he also did this so that the Gentiles could give glory to God for the mercy he gives to them . [ L Just as ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ So I will ·praise [ confess ] you among the ·Gentiles [ nations ] . I will sing ·praises [ psalms ] to your name [ Ps . 18:49 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	15	10	·The Scripture also [ L And again it ] says , “ ·Be happy [ Rejoice ; Celebrate ] , you ·Gentiles [ nations ] , together with his people [ Deut . 32:43 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	15	11	·Again the Scripture says [ L And again ] , “ All you ·Gentiles [ nations ] , praise the Lord . All you people , sing praises to him [ Ps . 117:1 ] . ”
EXB	Romans	15	12	And [ L again ] Isaiah says , “ ·A new king will come from the family of Jesse [ The root of Jesse will come/sprout ; C Jesse was the father of King David ] .

EXB	Romans	15	13	I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with ·much [ L all ] joy and peace ·while you trust [ because you trust ; through your faith ] in him . Then your hope will overflow by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul Talks About His Work
EXB	Romans	15	14	My brothers and sisters , I am ·sure [ fully convinced ] that you are [ indeed ] full of goodness . I know that you ·have all the knowledge you need [ L are filled with all knowledge ] and that you are able to ·teach [ instruct ; admonish ; warn ] each other .
EXB	Romans	15	16	to be a ·minister [ servant ] of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . I ·served God [ or perform priestly service ] ·by teaching his Good News [ for the Good News/Gospel of/about God ] , so that the Gentiles could be an offering that God would accept—an offering ·made holy [ sanctified ; purified ] by the Holy Spirit .
EXB	Romans	15	17	So I ·am proud [ have a reason to boast ] of what I have done for God in Christ Jesus .
EXB	Romans	15	18	I will not [ dare ] talk about anything except what Christ has done through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God . They have obeyed God because of what I have said and done ,
EXB	Romans	15	19	because of the power of ·miracles [ signs ] and ·the great things they saw [ wonders ; marvels ] , ·and because of [ or acccomplished through ] the power of the Spirit of God . I have ·finished my work of preaching [ fulfilled my commission to preach ; or fully preached ] the ·Good News [ Gospel ] from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum [ C a Roman province northwest of Macedonia ; modern Albania , Serbia and Montenegro ] .
EXB	Romans	15	20	[ So ; In this way ] I always ·want [ or try ; make it my ambition ] to preach the ·Good News [ Gospel ] in places where ·people have never heard of Christ [ L Christ has not been named ] , ·because I do not want [ or in order not ] to build on the ·work someone else has already started [ L foundation of others ] .

EXB	Romans	15	25	Now I am going to Jerusalem to ·help [ minister to ; provide a service for ] ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] .
EXB	Romans	15	26	The believers in Macedonia [ C northern Greece ] and Achaia [ C southern Greece ] were ·happy [ pleased ; or resolved ] to ·give their money to help [ make a contribution to ;

These Gentiles have shared in the Jews ’ spiritual blessings , so they should use their material ·possessions [ or blessings ] to ·help the Jews [ L render service to them ] .
EXB	Romans	15	28	[ L Therefore ] After I have completed this collection and ·delivered the money safely to them [ L sealed this fruit for them ; C uncertain idiom , likely indicating secure packaging or safe arrival of cargo ] , I will leave for Spain and stop and visit you .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	52	; Acts
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	18	[ L For ] The ·teaching [ message ; word ] about the cross is ·foolishness [ folly ] to those who are ·being lost [ headed for destruction ; perishing ] , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul Gives Thanks to God
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I always thank my God for you because of the ·grace [ gift ; favor ] God has given you in Christ Jesus .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	5	I thank God because in Christ you have been ·made rich [ enriched ] in every way , in all your ·speaking [ or spiritual gifts of speaking ] and in all your ·knowledge [ or gifts of spiritual knowledge ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	6	Just as our ·witness [ testimony ; message ] about Christ has been ·guaranteed to [ or confirmed among ] you ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so you ·have every [ L do not lack any ] ·gift from God [ spiritual gift ; L gift ] while you wait for the ·return [ L revelation ] of our Lord Jesus Christ .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	8	·Jesus [ L …who ] will keep you strong until the end so that ·there will be no wrong in you [ you will be blameless/faultless ] on the day ·our Lord Jesus Christ comes again [ L of our Lord Jesus Christ ; C the final day of judgment , known in the OT as “ the Day of the Lord ” ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God , who has called you into ·fellowship [ partnership ; relationship ] with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord , is faithful . Problems in the Church
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	10	I ·beg [ urge ; appeal to ] you , brothers and sisters , ·by the name [ or by the authority ; or as followers ] of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree with each other and not be ·split into groups [ divided into factions ] . I beg that you be ·completely joined together [ fully united ; or made complete ] by having the same ·kind of thinking [ L mind ] and the same ·purpose [ intention ; conviction ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	11	My brothers and sisters , some people from Chloe ’ s ·family [ household ; C these could be family members , servants , or business agents ] have ·told me quite plainly [ reported to me ] that there are ·quarrels [ conflicts ; rivalries ] among you .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	12	This is what I mean : One of you says , “ I follow Paul ” ; another says , “ I follow Apollos ” ; another says , “ I follow ·Peter [ L Cephas ; C Peter ’ s name in Aramaic ; 3:22 ; 9:5 ; 15:5 ; Mark 1:30 ; John 1:42 ] ” ; and another says , “ I follow Christ. ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	13	·Christ has been divided up into different groups ! [ or Is Christ divided ? ] Did Paul die on the cross for you ? No ! Were you baptized in the name of Paul ? No ! [ C “ No ! ” is implied but not stated in the Greek . ]
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	15	so that now no one can say you were baptized in my name .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( I also baptized the ·family [ household ] of Stephanas , but I do not remember if I baptized anyone else . )
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	17	[ L For ] Christ did not send me to baptize people but to preach the ·Good News [ Gospel ] , and not using ·words of human wisdom [ or eloquent language ; clever speech ] so that the cross of Christ [ C the message of Christ ’ s sacrificial death on the cross ] would not ·lose its power [ or become meaningless ; L be emptied ] . Christ Is God ’ s Power and Wisdom
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	19	[ L For ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise ; And I will ·reject [ thwart ; bring to nothing ] the ·intelligence [ discernment ; cleverness ] of the ·intelligent [ discerning ; clever ; Is . 29:14 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise person ? Where is the ·educated person [ scholar ; or scribe ; teacher of the law ] ? Where is the ·skilled talker [ orator ; debater ; philosopher ] of this ·world [ age ] ? ·God has [ L Has not God… ? ] made the wisdom of the world foolish .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	21	·In the wisdom of God the world did [ or God wisely determined that the world would ] not know God through its own wisdom . So God ·chose [ was pleased ] to use the ·message that sounds foolish [ L folly/foolishness of what was preached ] to save those who believe .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	22	[ L For ; Since ] The Jews ·ask for [ demand ] ·miracles [ L signs ] , and the Greeks ·want [ seek ; look for ] wisdom .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach ·that Christ was crucified [ Christ crucified ; or a crucified Messiah ] . This ·causes the Jews to stumble [ is a stumbling block/offense/obstacle to Jews ] and is ·foolishness [ folly ] to Gentiles .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But to those people God has called—both Jews and Greeks—Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	25	[ L For ] Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	26	Brothers and sisters , look at what you were when God called you . Not many of you were wise ·in the way the world judges wisdom [ by human standards ; L according to the flesh ] . Not many of you ·had great influence [ were powerful/strong ] . Not many of you ·came from important families [ were well-born ; were of high social status ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise , and he chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	28	He chose what the world thinks is ·unimportant [ insignificant ; lowly ] and what the world ·looks down on [ despises ] and thinks is nothing in order to destroy what the world thinks is ·important [ something special ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	29	God did this so that no one can ·brag [ boast ] in his presence .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	30	Because of God you are ·in [ united with ; in relationship with ] Christ Jesus , who has become for us wisdom from God . ·In Christ we are put right with God , and have been made holy , and have been set free from sin [ L …and became for us righteousness , holiness , and redemption ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	1	31	So , as the Scripture says , “ If people want to ·brag [ boast ] , they should ·brag [ boast ] only about the Lord [ Jer . 9:24 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians 2:1 God ’ s secret Some Greek copies read “ God ’ s message . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	2	[ L For ] I ·decided [ resolved ] that while I was with you I would ·forget about everything [ L not know anything ] except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	3	So when I came to you , I was weak and fearful and trembling .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	4	My ·teaching [ message ; speech ] and preaching were not with words of human wisdom that ·persuade [ or entice ] people but with ·proof of the power that the Spirit gives [ or proof powerfully revealed by the Spirit ; or demonstrations of the Spirit and of power ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	5	This was so that your faith would be in God ’ s power and not in human wisdom . God ’ s Wisdom
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	6	However , we speak wisdom to those who are mature . But this wisdom is not from this ·world [ age ] or from the rulers of this ·world [ age ] , who ·are losing their power [ will soon disappear ; are passing away ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	7	We speak God ’ s ·secret wisdom [ or wisdom in a mystery ; 2:1 ] , which he has kept hidden . Before the ·world began [ ages ] , God ·planned [ decreed ; destined ] this wisdom for our glory .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this ·world [ age ] understood it . If they had , they would not have crucified the ·Lord of glory [ glorious Lord ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written in the Scriptures : “ No ·one [ L eye ] has ever seen this , and no ·one [ L ear ] has ever heard about it . No ·one [ L human heart ] has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him [ Is . 64:4 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But God has ·shown [ revealed to ] us these things through the Spirit . [ L For ] The Spirit ·searches out [ examines ; scrutinizes ] all things , even the ·deep secrets [ deep things ; depths ] of God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	11	Who knows the thoughts that another person has ? Only a person ’ s spirit that lives within him knows his thoughts . It is the same with God . No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we did not receive the spirit of the world , but we received the Spirit that is from God so that we can know all that God has [ freely ] given us .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	13	And we speak about these things , not with words taught us by human wisdom but with words taught us by the Spirit . And so we explain spiritual truths ·to spiritual people [ or to those who have the Spirit ; or with the Spirit ’ s words ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	14	A ·person who does not have the Spirit [ or natural person ] does not accept the ·truths [ L things ] that come from the Spirit of God . That person thinks they are foolish and can not understand them , because they can only be ·judged to be true [ discerned ; assessed ] by the Spirit .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	15	The ·spiritual person [ or person with the Spirit ] is able to ·judge [ discern ; assess ] all things , but no one can ·judge [ discern ; assess ] him . ·The Scripture says [ L For ] :
EXB	1%20Corinthians	2	16	“ Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Who has been able to ·teach [ advise ; counsel ] him [ Is . 40:13 ] ? ” But we have the mind of Christ [ C the Holy Spirit reveals God and his ways to us ; Rom . 11:34 ] . Footnotes -
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	3	You are still ·not spiritual [ carnal ; fleshly ; living by your sinful nature ] , because there is ·jealousy [ envy ] and ·quarreling [ conflict ; rivalry ] among you , and this shows that you are ·not spiritual [ carnal ; fleshly ; living by your sinful nature ] . You are ·acting [ living ; L walking ] ·like people of the world [ or like ordinary/unsaved people ; or on a merely human level ; L according to man ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	2	·The teaching I gave you was like milk [ L I gave you milk to drink ] , not solid food , because you were not yet able to take solid food [ C the comparison is between basic and advanced teaching ] . And even now you are not ready .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	4	One of you says , “ I belong to Paul , ” and another says , “ I belong to Apollos. ” When you say things like this , ·you are [ L are you not… ? ] ·acting like people of the world [ or living on a merely human level ; L people ; human beings ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	5	·Is Apollos important ? No ! [ L What , then , is Apollos ? ] ·Is Paul important ? No ! [ L And what is Paul ? ] We are only servants of God who helped you believe . Each one of us did the work the Lord gave us to do .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed , and Apollos watered it . But God is the One who made it grow .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So the one who plants is not ·important [ L anything ] , and the one who waters is not ·important [ L anything ] , but only God , who makes things grow .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters ·have the same purpose [ or are equal ; L are one ] , and each will ·be rewarded [ receive wages ] for his own work .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	9	We are ·God ’ s workers , working together [ coworkers belonging to God ; coworkers in God ’ s service ] ; you are God ’ s ·farm [ field ] , God ’ s building .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	10	·Using [ or Because of ] the ·gift [ grace ] God gave me , I laid the foundation of that building like an ·expert [ skilled ; wise ] builder . Others are building on that foundation , but ·all people [ L each one ] should be careful how they build on it .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	11	The foundation that has already been laid is Jesus Christ , and no one can lay down any other foundation .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	12	But if ·people [ anyone ; someone ] build on that foundation , using gold , silver , ·jewels [ precious stones ] , wood , ·grass [ or hay ] , or straw ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	13	their work will be ·clearly seen [ or shown for what it is ] , because the ·day of judgment [ L day ] will make it ·visible [ clear ; obvious ] . That day will ·appear [ or reveal it ; expose it ] with fire , and the fire will test everyone ’ s work to show what sort of work it was .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If the ·building that has been put on the foundation [ L work ] still stands , the builder will get ·a reward [ or wages ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	15	But if the ·building [ L work ] is burned up , the builder will ·suffer loss [ or be fined ; or be punished ] . The builder will be saved , but it will be as one who escaped ·from a fire [ L through fire ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Don ’ t ·you [ you all ; C the verb is plural ] know that you are God ’ s temple and that God ’ s Spirit lives in you [ C just as God ’ s presence filled the tabernacle ; Ex . 40:34–38 ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy that person , because God ’ s temple is holy ·and you are that temple [ or and you are holy ; L which is what you are ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Do not ·fool [ deceive ] yourselves . If you think you are wise in this ·world [ age ] , you should become a fool so that you can become truly wise ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	19	because the wisdom of this world is ·foolishness [ folly ] with God . [ L For ] It is written in the Scriptures , “ He catches those who are wise in their own ·clever traps [ craftiness ; cunning ; Job 5:13 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	20	·It is also written in the Scriptures [ L And again ] , “ The Lord knows ·what wise people think [ L the thoughts/reasoning/machinations of the wise ] . He knows their thoughts are ·worthless [ pointless ; useless ; futile ; Ps . 94:11 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So you should not ·brag [ boast ] about ·human leaders [ L people ] . All things belong to you :
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Paul , Apollos , and ·Peter [ L Cephas ; C Peter ’ s name in Aramaic ; see 1:12 ] ; the world , life , death , the present , and the future—all these belong to you .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	3	23	And you belong to Christ , and Christ belongs to God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Thess . 2:9 ] . When people ·curse [ insult ; revile ] us , we bless them . When they ·hurt [ persecute ] us , we ·put up with it [ endure ; persevere ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	4	I know of no wrong I have done , but this does not make me ·right before the Lord [ innocent ; acquitted ; justified ] . The Lord is the One who judges me .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Now in this way ·those who are trusted with something valuable [ stewards ; household managers ] must ·show they are worthy of that trust [ L be found faithful ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	3	As for myself , ·I do not care [ or it is of no consequence ; L it is a minor thing ] if I am judged by you or by any human court . I do not even judge myself .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	5	So do not judge before the ·right [ appointed ] time ; wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness , and will make known the secret ·purposes [ motives ] of people ’ s hearts . Then God will ·praise [ give appropriate commendation to ] each one of them .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Brothers and sisters , I have used Apollos and myself as examples so you could learn through us the meaning of the saying , “ ·Follow only [ L Do not go beyond ] ·what is written in the Scriptures [ or what I have already written to you ; L what is written ] . ” Then you will not ·be more proud of one person than another [ or arrogantly support one person over another ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	7	[ L For ] Who ·says you are better than others [ made you so important ; or sees anything different in you ] ? What do you have that was not given to you ? And if it was given to you , why do you ·brag [ boast ] as if you did not ·receive it as a gift [ L receive it ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	8	·You think you already have everything you need [ L Already you have been satisfied/filled up ! ; C the Corinthians believed they had reached a higher spiritual status because of their wisdom ] . ·You think you are rich [ L Already you are rich ! ] . You ·think you have become kings [ have begun to reign… ! ] without us . I wish you really were ·kings [ reigning ] so we could ·be kings [ reign ] together with you .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	9	But it seems to me that God has put us apostles ·in last place [ or on display at the end of the procession ] , like those sentenced to die [ C the image is of prisoners of war being led through the city in disgrace , condemned to die in the arena ] . We are like a ·show [ spectacle ; display ] for the whole world to see—angels and people .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ ’ s sake , but you are very wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You receive honor , but we are ·shamed [ disgraced ; dishonored ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even ·to this very hour [ or now ] we do not have enough to eat or drink or to wear . We are often beaten , and we have no homes in which to live .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	12	We work hard with our own hands [ C Paul earned his own living so as not to burden the church and to avoid accusations of profiting from the Gospel ;
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	13	When they ·tell evil lies about [ slander ] us , we ·speak nice words about them [ answer gently ; or humbly appeal ; entreat ] . Even today , we are treated as though we were the garbage of the world—·the filth of the earth [ L everyone ’ s scum/filth ; or scum/filth in everyone ’ s eyes ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not writing this to make you feel ashamed , but to ·warn [ admonish ; correct ] you as my own ·dear [ beloved ] children .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though you may have ten thousand ·teachers [ guardians ; tutors ] in Christ , you do not have many fathers . [ L For ; Because ] Through the ·Good News [ Gospel ] I became your father in Christ Jesus ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	16	so I ·beg [ urge ; encourage ; exhort ] you , ·please follow my example [ L be imitators of me ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	17	That is why I am sending to you Timothy , my ·dear [ beloved ] and faithful son in the Lord . He will ·help you remember [ remind you about ] my way of life in Christ Jesus , just as I teach it in all the churches everywhere .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Some of you have become ·proud [ arrogant ; puffed up ] , thinking that I will not come to you again .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you very soon if the Lord ·wishes [ wills ; allows ] . Then I will ·know [ find out ; learn ] ·what the proud ones do , not what they say [ L not just the talk/word of these arrogant people , but also their power ] ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	4	20	because the kingdom of God ·is present [ or consists ] not in talk but in power .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	3	I am not there with you in person , but I am with you in spirit . And I have already ·judged [ condemned ] the man who did that sin as if I were really there .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	4	When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus , and I meet with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your ·bragging [ boasting ] is not good . You know the saying , “ Just a little ·yeast [ or leaven ; C leaven is a small lump of fermented dough used to make a loaf rise , as yeast is today ] makes the whole batch of dough rise [ C yeast/leaven symbolizes the permeating influence of this man ’ s sin within the community ; Gal . 5:9 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	7	·Take out all [ Cleanse ; Purge ] the old ·yeast [ leaven ] so that you will be a new batch of dough without ·yeast [ leaven ] , which you really are . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed [ C Christ ’ s sacrificial death rescued us from spiritual death , just as the blood of the first Passover lambs rescued the children of Israel ; Ex . 11—12 ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	8	So let us celebrate this feast [ C a new kind of Passover feast ] , but not with the bread that has the old ·yeast [ leaven ] —the ·yeast [ leaven ] of ·sin [ evil ; malice ] and wickedness [ C unleavened bread was used in the Passover celebration ; Ex . 12:15 ; Deut . 16:3 ] . Let us celebrate this feast with the bread that has no ·yeast [ leaven ] —the bread of ·goodness [ sincerity ] and truth .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote you in my earlier letter not to associate with those who sin sexually .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	10	But I did not [ L at all ] mean you should not associate with those of this world who sin sexually , or with the greedy , or ·robbers [ or swindlers ] , or those who worship idols . To get away from them you would have to leave this world .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	5	11	I am writing to tell you that you must not associate with those who call themselves ·believers in Christ [ a brother or sister ] but who sin sexually , or are greedy , or worship idols , or ·abuse others with words [ slander ] , or get drunk , or ·cheat [ swindle ] people . Do not even eat with people like that .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	6	7	The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated . Why not ·let yourselves be wronged [ suffer the injustice ] ? Why not let yourselves be cheated ?

EXB	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Don ’ t you know that anyone who joins with a prostitute [ C in a sexual relationship ] becomes one body with the prostitute ? For it is written in the Scriptures , “ The two will become one ·body [ flesh ; Gen. 2:24 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But the one who joins with the Lord [ C in spiritual union ] is one spirit with the Lord .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	6	18	So ·run away from [ flee ; stay away from ] sexual sin . Every other sin people do is outside their bodies , but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	6	19	·You should [ L Don ’ t you… ? ] know that your body is a temple for the Holy Spirit who is in you and was given to you by God . So you do not belong to yourselves ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	6	20	because you were ·bought by God [ L bought ] for a price . So honor God with your bodies .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish that everyone were like me [ C unmarried ] , but each person has his own gift from God . One has one gift , another has another gift .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have ·full rights [ L authority ] over her own body ; her husband shares them . And the husband does not have ·full rights [ authority ] over his own body ; his wife shares them [ C revolutionary teaching in the first century , when wives were generally viewed as the possession of their husbands ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because ·sexual sin is a danger [ of sexual temptations ; L of sexual sins ] , each man should ·have [ or have sexual relations with ] his own wife , and each woman should ·have [ or have sexual relations with ] her own husband .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should give his wife all that he owes her as his wife [ C meet her sexual needs ] . And the wife should give her husband all that she owes him as her husband [ C meet his sexual needs ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not ·refuse to give your bodies to [ refuse sex to ; L deprive ] each other , unless you both agree to stay away from sexual relations for a time so you can ·give your time [ devote yourselves ] to prayer . Then ·come together again [ resume your sexual relationship ] so Satan can not tempt you because of a lack of self-control .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I say this ·to give you permission to stay away from sexual relations for a time [ L as a concession/allowance ] . It is not a command to do so .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	8	Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this : It is good for them to stay unmarried as I am .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not ·control themselves [ exercise self-control ] , they should marry . It is better to marry than ·to burn with sexual desire [ L to burn ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	10	Now I give this command for the married people . ( The command is not from me ; it is from the Lord [ C Jesus taught on divorce ; Mark 10:5–12 ] . ) A wife should not ·leave [ separate from ; or divorce ] her husband .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if she does ·leave [ or divorce ] , she must not marry again , or she should ·make up [ reconcile ] with her husband . Also the husband should not ·divorce [ or leave ] his wife .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	12	For ·all the others [ the rest ] I say this ( I am saying this , not the Lord [ C Jesus gave no instruction on this , but Paul still speaks with authority as an apostle ] ) : If a ·Christian man [ L brother ] has a wife who is not a believer , and she is ·happy [ content ; willing ] to live with him , he must not ·divorce [ or leave ] her .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if a Christian woman has a husband who is not a believer , and he is ·happy [ content ; willing ] to live with her , she must not ·divorce [ or leave ] him .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	14	The husband who is not a believer is ·made holy [ sanctified ; touched by holiness ] through his believing wife . And the wife who is not a believer is ·made holy [ sanctified ; touched by holiness ] through her believing husband . If this were not true , your children would ·not be clean [ be spiritually impure ; or be without spiritual influence ] , but now your children are holy [ C some Corinthians said an unbeliever defiled a Christian marriage ; Paul reverses this and says believers “ sanctify ” the marriage ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if those who are not believers decide to ·leave [ or divorce ] , let them ·leave [ or divorce ] . When this happens , the ·Christian man [ L brother ] or ·woman [ L sister ] is ·free [ L not bound ; C to the marriage covenant ] . But God called us [ a ] to ·live in peace [ L peace ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	16	Wife , you don ’ t know ; maybe you will save your husband . And husband , you don ’ t know ; maybe you will save your wife . Live as God Called You
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But in any case each one of you should continue to live ·the way [ or in the situation ] God has given you to live—the way you were when God called you . This is a ·rule [ instruction ] I make in all the churches .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	18	If a man was already circumcised when he was called , he should not undo his circumcision . If a man was without circumcision when he was called , he should not be circumcised .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	19	·It is not important if a man is circumcised or not [ L Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing ] . The important thing is ·obeying [ keeping ] God ’ s commands .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each one of you should stay ·the way you were [ in the situation you were in ] when God called you .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	21	If you were a slave when God called you , do not let that bother you . But if you can ·be free [ gain your freedom ] , ·then make good use of your freedom [ or then take that opportunity ; or instead remain and make use of your opportunities as a slave ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	22	[ L For ] Those who were slaves when the Lord called them are free persons who belong to the Lord . In the same way , those who were free when they were called are now Christ ’ s slaves .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You all were bought at a great price , so do not become slaves of people .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brothers and sisters , each of you should stay as you were when you were called , ·and stay there with God [ or with God at your side ; L with God ] . Questions About Getting Married
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now I write about ·people who are not married [ or those never married ; or betrothed women ; L virgins ] . I have no command from the Lord about this ; I give my ·opinion [ perspective ; judgment ] . But I can be trusted , because the Lord has shown me mercy .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	26	Because ·the present time is a time of trouble [ of the present crisis/distress/trouble ] , I think it is ·good [ best ] for you to stay the way you are .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	27	If you ·have a wife [ L are bound to a wife ; or are pledged to a woman ] , do not try to ·become free from [ or divorce ] her . If you are not married , do not try to find a wife .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you decide to marry , you have not sinned . And if a ·girl who has never married [ or betrothed woman ; L virgin ] decides to marry , she has not sinned . But those who marry will have ·trouble [ trials ; tribulation ] in ·this life [ this world ; L the flesh ] , and I want ·you to be free [ to spare you ] from trouble [ C during times of persecution , those with family obligations suffer the most ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	29	Brothers and sisters , this is what I mean : ·We do not have much time left [ The time is short/limited/coming to an end ] . So starting now , those who have wives should live as if they had no wives .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	30	Those who are ·crying [ weeping ; mourning ] should live as if they were not ·crying [ weeping ; mourning ] . Those who ·are happy [ rejoice ] should live as if they were not ·happy [ rejoicing ] . Those who buy things should live as if they ·own [ or could keep/hold on to ] nothing .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	31	Those who use ·the things of the world [ L the world ] should live as if they were not ·using [ engrossed in ; dependent upon ] them , because this world in its present form ·will soon be gone [ is passing away ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I want you to be free from ·worry [ concern ] . A man who is not married is ·busy [ concerned ] with the Lord ’ s work , trying to please the Lord .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a man who is married is ·busy [ concerned ] with things of the world , trying to please his wife .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	34	He ·must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord [ L is divided ] . A woman who is not married or a ·girl who has never married [ or betrothed woman ; L virgin ] is ·busy [ concerned ] with the ·Lord ’ s work [ L things of the Lord ] . She wants to be holy in body and spirit . But a married woman is ·busy [ concerned ] with things of the world , as to how she can please her husband .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am saying this to help you , not to ·limit [ restrain ] you . But I want you to live ·in the right way [ or in a proper/orderly manner ; or above criticism ] , to ·give yourselves fully [ be devoted ] to the Lord without ·concern for other things [ distraction ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	36	If a man thinks he is ·not doing the right thing with [ or acting improperly toward ] ·the girl he is engaged to [ L his virgin ; C it is possible , but less likely , that the passage concerns a father ’ s decision to allow his virgin daughter to marry ; a third option is that it is about a couple in a “ spiritual ” ( celibate ) marriage deciding whether to consummate it ] , if ·she is almost past the best age to marry [ or his passions are too strong ; L he/she is at the highest point ] and ·he feels he should marry her [ L it ought to be so ] , he should do what he wants . They should get married . It is no sin .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But if a man is ·sure [ resolved ; firm ] in his ·mind [ conviction ; heart ] that there is no ·need for marriage [ obligation ; necessity ] , and has his own ·desires [ or will ] under control , and has decided ·not to marry the one to whom he is engaged [ to keep her a virgin ] , he is doing the right thing .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So the man who marries his ·fiancée [ L virgin ] does right , but the man who does not marry will do better .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A woman ·must stay with [ is bound to ] her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry any man she wants , but she must marry ·another believer [ L in the Lord ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	7	40	The woman is ·happier [ better off ; more blessed ] if she ·does not marry again [ L remains as she is ] . This is my ·opinion [ perspective ; judgment ] , but I believe I also have God ’ s Spirit [ C Paul affirms he is speaking for God ] . Footnotes -
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	1	] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food will not ·bring us closer [ make us acceptable ] to God . Refusing to eat does not make us ·less pleasing to God [ any worse ; L lacking ] , and eating does not make us ·better in God ’ s sight [ any better ; L abounding ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	13	So if the food I eat causes them to fall into sin , I will never eat meat again so that I will not cause any of them to ·sin [ stumble ; fall into sin ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If you think you know something , you do not yet know as ·well as you should [ L you ought to know ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any person loves God , that person is known by God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	4	So ·this is what I say about [ L concerning ] eating meat sacrificed to idols : We know that an idol is really nothing in the world , and we know there is ·only one God [ no God but one ; Deut . 4:35 ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	39	; C these may be other slogans the church was using to justify their behavior ; see v.
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	5	Even though there are things called gods , in heaven or on earth ( and there are many “ gods ” and “ lords ” ) ,
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	6	for us there is only one God—the Father . All things came from him , and we live for him . And there is only one Lord—Jesus Christ . All things were made through him , and we also ·were made [ exist ; live ] through him .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not all people know this . Some people are still so used to idols that when they eat meat , they still think of it as being sacrificed to an idol . Because their conscience is weak , when they eat it , ·they feel guilty [ L their conscience is defiled ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But be careful that ·your freedom [ this right/authority of yours ] does not ·cause those who are weak in faith to fall into sin [ L become a stumbling block to the weak ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	10	Suppose one of you who has knowledge eats in an idol ’ s temple . Someone who ·is weak in faith [ or has a weak conscience ] might see you eating there and be ·encouraged [ enboldened ] to eat meat sacrificed to idols ·while thinking it is wrong to do so [ or as a result of his weak conscience ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	11	This weak ·believer [ L brother ] for whom Christ died is ·ruined [ destroyed ] because of your “ knowledge. ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	8	12	When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ like this and ·cause them to do what they feel is wrong [ L wound their weak conscience ] , you are also sinning against Christ .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	9	[ L For ] It is written in the law of Moses : “ Do not muzzle an ox when it is ·working in [ treading ; threshing ] the grain [ Deut . 25:4 ] . ” When God said this , was he ·thinking only [ concerned ] about oxen ? No .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If others do not accept me as an apostle , surely you do , because you are ·proof that I am an apostle [ L the seal/verification of my apostleship ] in the Lord .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	3	This is the answer I give people who want to ·judge me [ examine me ; question my credentials ] :
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Do we not have the right to eat and drink [ C receive hospitality and support for their missionary work ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Do we not have the right to ·bring a believing wife with us when we travel [ or be married to a believer ; L take along a wife who is a sister ] as do the other apostles and the Lord ’ s brothers [ Matt . 13:55 ; Acts 1:14 ] and ·Peter [ L Cephas ; C Peter ’ s name in Aramaic ; see 1:12 ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Are Barnabas [ Acts 13—14 ] and I the only ones who ·must work to earn our living [ L don ’ t have the authority/right not to work ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	7	·No soldier [ L Who… ? ] ever serves in the army and pays his own salary . ·No one [ L Who… ? ] ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes . ·No person [ L Who… ? ] takes care of a flock without drinking some of the milk .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I do not say this ·by human authority [ from human experience ; L according to man ] ; God ’ s law also says the same thing .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	10	He was ·really [ surely ] talking ·about us [ for our benefit ] . Yes , that Scripture was written for us , because it goes on to say : “ The one who plows and the one who ·works in the grain [ threshes ] should hope to get some of the grain for their work. ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	11	·Since [ If ] we ·planted [ sowed ] spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we should harvest material things from you [ C receive support for ministry ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others have the right to get something from you , surely we have this right , ·too [ or even more so ] . But we ·do not use it [ have not exercised this right ] . No , we put up with everything ourselves so that we will not ·keep anyone from believing [ L put up a hindrance to ] the ·Good News [ Gospel ] of Christ .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	13	·Surely [ L Don ’ t… ? ] you know that those who ·work at the Temple [ perform priestly temple service ] get their food from the Temple , and those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord has commanded that those who ·tell the Good News [ proclaim/preach the Gospel ] should get their living from ·this work [ L the Gospel ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this now to get anything from you . I would rather die than to have my reason for ·bragging [ boasting ] taken away .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	16	·Telling the Good News [ Preaching the Gospel ] does not give me any reason for ·bragging [ boasting ] . Telling the Good News is my duty—something I must do . And ·how terrible it will be for [ L woe to ] me if I do not ·tell the Good News [ preach the Gospel ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I preach ·because it is my own choice [ voluntarily ] , I have a reward . But if I preach ·and it is not my choice to do so [ without volunteering ] , I am ·only doing the duty that was given to me [ L entrusted with a stewardship/responsibility ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	18	So what ·reward [ payment ; wages ] do I get ? Only this : that when I tell the ·Good News [ Gospel ] I can offer it ·freely [ free of charge ] . I do not ·use [ take advantage of ; or misuse ] my full rights in ·my work of preaching the Good News [ L the Gospel ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	19	I am free and belong to no one . But I make myself a slave to all people to win as many as I can .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews I became like a Jew to win the Jews . I myself am not ·ruled by [ subject to ; L under ] the law . But to those who are ·ruled by [ subject to ; L under ] the law I became like a person who is ·ruled by [ subject to ; L under ] the law . I did this to win those who are ·ruled by [ subject to ; L under ] the law .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those who are without the law [ C Gentiles ] I became like a person who is without the law . I did this to win those people who are without the law . ( But really , I am not without God ’ s law—I am ·ruled by [ L under ] Christ ’ s law . )
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To those who are weak [ C in faith ; 8:7–13 ] , I became weak so I could win the weak . I have become all things to all people so I could save some of them in any way possible .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this because of the ·Good News [ Gospel ] and so I can ·share in its blessings [ or be a participant in it ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	24	·You [ L Don ’ t you… ? ] know that in a ·race [ L stadium ] all the runners run , but only one gets the prize . So run to win !
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	25	All those who compete in the games ·use self-control [ train with strict discipline ] so they can win a ·crown [ victor ’ s wreath ] . That ·crown [ victor ’ s wreath ] is ·an earthly thing that lasts only a short time [ L perishable ] , but our crown ·will never be destroyed [ L is imperishable ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	26	So I do not run ·without a goal [ aimlessly ] . I fight like a boxer who is hitting something—not just the air .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	9	27	I ·treat my body hard [ discipline/subdue/pummel my body ] and ·make it my slave [ subdue it ] so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	11	21	This is because when you eat , each person eats without waiting for the others [ C the wealthy church members were arriving early to avoid sharing with the poorer members ; such social distinctions were common throughout the Greco-Roman world ] .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	11	28	·Look into your own hearts [ L Let a person examine himself ] before you eat the bread and drink the cup ,

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	15	And also , we are ·guilty of lying [ L found to be false witnesses ] about God , because we testified ·of him [ L against God ] that he raised Christ from the dead . But if people are not raised from the dead , then God never raised Christ .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	3	[ L For ] I passed on to you what I received , which is ·of greatest importance [ or the first thing I told you ] : that Christ died for our sins , ·as the Scriptures say [ L according to the Scripture ; Is . 53:5–6 ] ;
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day ·as the Scriptures say [ L according to the Scripture ; Ps . 16:8–11 ] ;
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he was seen by ·Peter [ L Cephas ; C Peter ’ s name in Aramaic ; see 1:12 ] and then by ·the twelve apostles [ L the Twelve ; Luke 24:33–36 ] .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	8	Last of all he was seen by me [ Acts
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles . I am not even ·good enough [ worthy ] to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But God ’ s grace has made me what I am , and his grace to me was not ·wasted [ in vain ; without effect ] . [ L On the contrary ; Indeed ] I worked harder than all ·the other apostles [ of them ] . ( But it was not I really ; it was God ’ s grace that was with me . )

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now ·since we preached that Christ was [ L if Christ is preached as ] raised from the dead , why do some of you say that people will not be raised from the dead [ C some Corinthians denied the resurrection of the body ] ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If ·no one is ever raised [ L there is no resurrection ] from the dead , then Christ has not been raised .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is ·worth nothing [ futile ; useless ; empty ] , and your faith is ·worth nothing [ futile ; useless ; empty ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	16	If the dead are not raised , Christ has not been raised either .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ has not been raised , then your faith ·has nothing to it [ is futile/useless/empty ] ; you are still ·guilty of [ or a slave to ; L in ] your sins .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	21	Death has come ·because of what one man did [ through a man/human being ] , but the rising from death also comes ·because of one man [ through a man/human being ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	22	In Adam all of us die . In the same way , in Christ all of us will be made alive again [ Rom . 5:12–21 ] .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	25	[ L For ] Christ must ·rule [ reign ] until he puts all enemies under his ·control [ L feet ; Ps . 110:1 ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be destroyed will be death .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	27	·The Scripture says that God put [ L For he has subjected ] all things under his ·control [ L feet ; Ps . 8:6 ] . When it says “ all things ” are ·under [ subjected to ] him , it is clear this does not include the One [ C God the father ] who put everything under his control .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	28	After everything has been ·put under [ subjected to ] the Son , then he will ·put himself under [ be subjected to ] ·God [ L the One… ] , who had put all things under him . ·Then [ or …so that ] God will be ·the complete ruler over everything [ or supreme in every place and in every way ; L all in all ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	29	If the dead are never raised , what will people do who are being baptized for the dead [ C it is unclear what this practice was or whether Paul approves or disapproves ] ? If the dead are not raised at all , why are people being baptized for them ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And what about us ? Why do we put ourselves in danger every hour ?
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I ·die [ face death ] every day . ·That is true , brothers and sisters , just as it is true that I brag about you [ L ( I swear ) by my boasting in you , brothers ( and sisters ) , which I have ] in Christ Jesus our Lord .

EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone may ask , “ How are the dead raised ? What kind of body will they have ? ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Foolish person ! When you sow a seed , it must die in the ground before it can ·live and grow [ come to life ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And when you sow it , it does not have the same “ body ” it will have later . [ L But ; On the contrary ] What you sow is only a bare seed , maybe wheat or something else .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives it a body that he ·has planned [ wants ; has chosen ] for it , and God gives each kind of seed its own body .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All things made of flesh are not the same : People have one kind of flesh , animals have another , birds have another , and fish have another .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	40	Also there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . But the ·beauty [ splendor ; glory ] of the heavenly bodies is one kind , and the ·beauty [ splendor ; glory ] of the earthly bodies is another .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has one kind of ·beauty [ splendor ; glory ] , the moon has another ·beauty [ splendor ; glory ] , and the stars have another . And each star is different in its ·beauty [ splendor ; glory ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	42	It is the same with the dead who are raised to life . ·The body that is “ planted ” will ruin and decay [ L It is sown/buried in corruption ] , but it is raised ·to a life that can not be destroyed [ imperishable ; L in incorruption ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	43	·When the body is “ planted , ” it is without honor [ L It is sown/buried in dishonor ] , but it is raised in glory . ·When the body is “ planted , ” it is weak [ L It is sown/buried in weakness ] , but ·when it is raised , it is powerful [ L it is raised in power ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	44	·The body that is “ planted ” is a physical body [ L It is sown/buried a natural/physical/soulish body ] . ·When it is raised , it is [ L It is raised ] a spiritual body . There is a ·physical [ natural ; soulish ] body , and there is also a spiritual body .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	45	[ L So also ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ The first man , Adam , became a living ·person [ soul ; Gen. 2:7 ] . ” But the last Adam [ C Christ ] became a spirit that gives life .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	46	[ L But ] The spiritual did not come first , but the ·physical [ natural ; soulish ] and then the spiritual .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man came from the dust of the earth . The second man came from heaven .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	48	People who ·belong to the earth [ or are of dust ] are like the first man of ·earth [ dust ] . But those people who belong to heaven are like the man of heaven .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	49	Just as we ·were made like [ L have borne the image of ] the man of earth , so we will [ a ] also ·be made like [ bear the image of ] the man of heaven .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	50	I tell you this , brothers and sisters : Flesh and blood can not ·have a part in [ inherit ] the kingdom of God . ·Something that will ruin can not [ …nor can the perishable/corruptible ] ·have a part in something that never ruins [ inherit the imperishable/incorruptible ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	51	But look ! I tell you ·this secret [ a mystery ; 2:1 ] : We will not all ·sleep in death [ L sleep ; C a euphemism for death ] , but we will all be changed .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	52	It will ·take only a second [ happen in a flash ] —as quickly as an eye ·blinks [ or twinkles ] —when the last trumpet sounds . The trumpet will sound , and those who have died will be raised ·to live forever [ imperishable ; incorruptible ] , and we will be changed [
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	53	[ L For ] This body that ·can be destroyed [ is perishable/corruptible ] must clothe itself with ·something that can never be destroyed [ the imperishable/incorruptible ] . And this ·body that dies [ L mortal ] must clothe itself with ·something that can never die [ immortality ] .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So when this body that ·can be destroyed [ is perishable/corruptible ] will clothe itself with that which ·can never be destroyed [ is imperishable/incorruptible ] , and this ·body that dies [ L mortal ] will clothe itself with ·that which can never die [ immortality ] , then this Scripture will ·be made true [ come to pass ] : “ Death is ·destroyed forever [ L swallowed up ] in victory [ Is . 25:8 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	55	“ [ L O ] Death , where is your victory ? Death , where is your ·pain [ L sting ; Hos . 13:14 ] ? ”
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Death ’ s ·power to hurt [ L sting ] is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But we thank God ! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
EXB	1%20Corinthians	15	58	So my ·dear [ beloved ] brothers and sisters , stand strong . Do not let anything move you . Always ·give yourselves fully to [ excel in ] the work of the Lord , because you know that your work in the Lord is ·never wasted [ not useless/in vain ] . Footnotes -

EXB	2%20Corinthians	3	15	Even today , when they read ·the law of Moses [ L Moses ] , there is a ·covering over [ L veil laying upon ] their ·minds [ hearts ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	3	16	But when a person ·changes and follows [ L turns to ] the Lord , that ·covering [ veil ] is taken away [ Ex . 34:34 ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	3	17	The Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	3	18	·Our faces , then , are not covered [ L With an unveiled face… ] . We all ·show [ reflect ; or behold ; or contemplate ] the Lord ’ s glory , and we are being ·changed [ transformed ] ·to be like him [ L into the same image ] . This change in us ·brings ever greater glory [ or is from one degree of glory to another ; L is from glory to glory ] , which comes from the Lord , who is the Spirit .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	2	But we have ·turned away from [ rejected ; renounced ] ·secret [ underhanded ] and shameful ways . We ·use no trickery [ L do not walk in deception ] , and we do not ·change [ distort ] the ·teaching [ word ] of God . We ·teach the truth plainly [ fully/openly disclose the truth ] , ·showing everyone who we are so that they can know in their hearts what kind of people we are [ L commending ourselves to every person ’ s conscience ] in God ’ s sight .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	4	The ·devil who rules this world [ L god of this age ] has blinded the minds of ·those who do not believe [ unbelievers ] . [ L …so that ] They can not see the light of the Good News—the Good News ·about [ that reveals ] the glory of Christ , who is ·exactly like [ L the image of ] God .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	3	If the ·Good News [ Gospel ] that we preach is ·hidden [ veiled ] , it is ·hidden [ veiled ] only to those who are ·lost [ perishing ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	5	[ L For ] We do not preach about ourselves , but we preach that Jesus Christ is Lord and that we are your ·servants [ slaves ; bondservants ] for Jesus .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	6	[ L For ; Because ] God who said , “ Let the light shine out of the darkness [ Gen. 1:3 ; Is . 9:2 ] , ” is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts ·by letting us know [ or to give us the knowledge of ] the glory of God that is in the face of Christ . Spiritual Treasure in Clay Jars
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	7	[ L But ] We have this treasure ·from God , but we are like clay jars that hold the treasure [ L in clay jars ] . This shows that the ·great [ extraordinary ; transcendent ] power is from God , not from us .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We have ·troubles all around us [ or all kinds of troubles/trials ] , but we are not ·defeated [ crushed ] . We ·do not know what to do [ are perplexed/bewildered ] , but we do not ·give up the hope of living [ despair ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	9	We are ·persecuted [ pursued ] , but ·God does not leave us [ not abandoned/left behind ] . We are ·hurt [ L struck down ; knocked over ] sometimes , but we are not destroyed .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	10	We always carry the death of Jesus in our own bodies [ C Paul was in constant danger of the kind of violent death Jesus experienced ] so that the life of Jesus [ C resurrection life ] can also be ·seen [ revealed ; manifested ] in our bodies .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	11	[ L For ] We are alive , but for Jesus we are always ·in danger of [ L being handed over to ] death so that the life of Jesus can be ·seen [ revealed ; manifested ] in our ·bodies that die [ mortal flesh ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So death is working in us , but life is working in you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	13	It is written in the Scriptures , “ I believed , so I spoke [ Ps . 116:10 ] . ” ·Our faith is like this , too [ L Having the same spirit of faith , … ] . We also believe , and so we speak .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	14	We know that ·God [ L the one ] who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and will ·bring us together with you into his presence [ L present ( us ) with you ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	15	All these things are for ·you [ your benefit ] , so that the grace of God that is ·being given [ expanding ; increasing ] to more and more people will bring increasing thanks to God for his glory . Living by Faith
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	16	So we do not ·give up [ despair ; lose heart ] . Though our ·physical body [ L outer person ] is ·becoming older and weaker [ decaying ; being destroyed ] , our ·spirit inside us [ L inner ( person ) ] is ·made new [ being renewed ] every day .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	17	·We have small troubles for a while now , but they [ L For our brief and insignificant trials/tribulations ] are ·helping us gain [ or producing in us ] an eternal ·glory [ L burden/weight of glory ] that ·is much greater than [ overwhelmingly exceeds ] the troubles .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	4	18	We set our eyes not on what we see but on what we can not see . [ L For ; Because ] What we see ·will last only a short time [ L is temporary/transitory ] , but what we can not see ·will last forever [ L is eternal ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	2	But now we ·groan [ sigh ] in this ·tent [ or body ; L one ] , longing to be clothed in our heavenly ·home [ dwelling place ] ,
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	5	This is what God ·made [ designed ; prepared ] us for , and he has given us the Spirit to be a ·guarantee for this new life [ deposit ; down payment ; 1:22 ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	3	because it will clothe us so we will not be naked .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	4	While we live in this ·body [ L tent ] , we ·have burdens [ are weighed down ] , and we ·groan [ sigh ] . We do not want to be ·naked [ stripped ; unclothed ] , but we want to be clothed with our heavenly home . Then ·this body that dies [ L the mortal ] will be ·fully covered with [ L swallowed up by ] life [ Is . 25:8 ;
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	1	Cor . 15:54 ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	6	So we always have courage . We know that while we ·live [ L are at home ] in this body , we are ·away [ absent ; or exiles ] from the Lord .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	7	We ·live [ walk ] by ·what we believe [ faith ] , not by ·what we can see [ sight ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	8	So I say that we ·have courage [ or are confident ] . We really ·want [ would prefer ] to be ·away [ absent ; or exiled ] from this body and be at home with the Lord .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Our only ·goal [ aim ; ambition ] is to please ·God [ L him ] whether we ·live here [ are at home ] or ·there [ are absent/exiled ] ,
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	10	because we must all stand before ·Christ to be judged [ L the Bema/judgment seat of Christ ; C the Bema was a raised platform from which civic leaders made pronouncements and rendered judgment ] . [ L …so that ] Each of us will receive what we should get—good or bad—for the things we did in the earthly body . Becoming Friends with God
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	11	[ L Therefore ] Since we know what it means to fear the Lord , we try to persuade people [ C either about the truth of the Gospel or about Paul ’ s good motives ] . God knows what we really are , and I hope that in your ·hearts [ consciences ] you know , too .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not trying to ·prove [ commend ] ourselves to you again , but we are giving you a ·reason [ opportunity ] to ·be proud of [ boast about ] us . Then you will have an answer for those who ·are proud [ boast ] about ·things that can be seen [ outward appearance ] rather than what is in the heart .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If we are out of our minds , it is for God . If we have our right minds , it is for you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	14	[ L For ] The love of Christ ·controls [ compels ; drives ] us , because we ·know [ are convinced ; have concluded ] that One died for all , so all have died [ C we died spiritually with Christ , the penalty for our sins ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	15	Christ died for all so that those who live would ·not continue to [ no longer ] live for themselves , but for him who died for them and was raised from the dead .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	16	[ L So ; As a result ] From ·this time [ now ] on we do not think of anyone ·as the world does [ or from a merely human perspective ; L according to the flesh ] . [ L Although ] In the past we thought of Christ ·as the world thinks [ or as nothing more than a man ; L according to the flesh ] , but we no longer think of him in that way .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	17	If anyone belongs to Christ , ·there is a new creation [ the new creation has arrived ; or that person has become a new creation ] . The old things have gone ; [ L look ; T behold ] ·everything is made new [ the new has come ] !
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this is from God , who through Christ ·made peace between us and [ reconciled us to ] himself , and gave us the ·work of telling everyone about the peace we can have with him [ L ministry/service of reconciliation ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	19	[ L For ] God was in Christ , ·making peace between the world and [ reconciling the world to ] himself . In Christ , God did not ·hold the world guilty of its sins [ L count their trespasses against them ] . And he ·gave [ committed/entrusted to ] us this message of ·peace [ reconciliation ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	20	So we ·have been sent to speak [ L are ambassadors ] for Christ . It is as if God is ·calling to [ urging ; exhorting ; encouraging ] you through us . We speak for Christ when we ·beg [ implore ; urge ] you to be ·at peace with [ reconciled to ] God .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	5	21	God made ·Christ [ L the one ] who ·had no sin [ or never sinned ; L did not know sin ] to become sin for us , so that in ·Christ [ L him ] we could become ·right with [ L the righteousness of ] God .

EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We try not to ·be a problem [ cause offense ; place an obstacle/stumbling block ] for anyone in any way , so that no one will find fault with our ·work [ ministry ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But in every way ·we show we are servants of God [ or as God ’ s servants/ministers , we commend ourselves ] : ·in accepting many hard things [ in/with great endurance ] , in ·troubles [ trials ; tribulation ] , in ·difficulties [ hardships ; times of need ] , ·and in great problems [ in distress/calamities/L tight spots ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	5	·We are beaten [ L …in beatings/floggings ] ·and thrown into prison [ L in imprisonments ] . ·We meet those who become upset with us and start riots [ L …in riots/rebellions ] . ·We work hard [ L …in hard labors ] , ·and sometimes we get no sleep [ L …in sleepless nights ] ·or food [ L …in hunger ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	7	by ·speaking the truth [ or the message/word of truth ; C the Gospel ] , and by God ’ s power . ·We use our right living [ L …with weapons of righteousness ] ·to defend ourselves against everything [ or both to attack ( with a sword ) and defend ( with a shield ) ; L in our right hands and in our left ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	8	·Some people honor us , but others blame us [ L …through honor/glory and dishonor/disgrace… ] . ·Some people say evil things about us , but others say good things [ L …through slander and praise… ] . ·Some people say we are liars , but we speak the truth [ L … ( treated ) as deceivers , yet true… ] .

EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not ·join yourselves to [ become partners with ; L be mismatched/unevenly yoked with ] unbelievers . ·Good and bad do not belong together [ L For what partnership has righteousness and wickedness/lawlessness ? ] . ·Light and darkness can not share together [ Or what fellowship/partnership can light have with darkness ? ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	15	How can Christ and Belial [ C the devil ; Satan ] have any ·agreement [ harmony ; accord ] ? What can a believer ·have together [ share in common ] with a nonbeliever ?
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	16	What ·agreement [ union ] can the temple of God have with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God [
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	1	Cor . 3:16 ] . As God said : “ I will live with them and walk with them . And I will be their God , and they will be my people [ Lev . 26:11–12 ; Jer . 32:38 ; Ezek . 37:27 ] . ”
EXB	2%20Corinthians	6	17	“ [ L Therefore ] ·Leave those people [ L Come out from their midst ] , and be separate , says the Lord . Touch nothing that is ·unclean [ polluted , defiled ] , and I will ·accept [ receive ; welcome ] you [ Is . 52:11 ; Ezek . 20:41 ] . ”

EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	2	·Open your hearts to [ L Make room for ] us . We have not done wrong to anyone , we have not ·ruined the faith of [ L ruined ; corrupted ] anyone , and we have not ·cheated [ exploited ] anyone .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	7	We were ·comforted [ encouraged ] , not only by his ·coming [ arrival ; presence ] but also by the comfort you gave him . Titus told us about your ·wish to see me [ L longing ] and ·that you are very sorry for what you did [ L your sorrow/mourning ; C regret for their treatment of Paul during his previous visit ; 1:23 ; 2:1 ] . He also told me about your great ·care [ or loyalty ; L zeal ] for me , and when I heard this , I ·was much happier [ rejoiced even more ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to ·blame [ condemn ] you . [ L For ] I told you before that ·we love you so much [ L you are in our hearts so that ] we would live or die with you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	4	I ·feel very sure of you [ am very confident in you ; or have spoken very boldy/frankly to you ] and am very proud of you . You give me much ·comfort [ encouragement ] , and in all of our ·troubles [ trials ; tribulation ] I ·have great [ overflow with ] joy .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	5	[ L For ] When we came into Macedonia [ 1:16 ] , ·we [ our body/flesh ] had no rest [ C Here Paul picks up his account where he left off at 2:13 ] . We found ·trouble [ trial ; tribulation ] all around us . We had ·fighting [ battles ; conflicts ] on the outside and fear on the inside .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who ·comforts [ encourages ] those who are ·troubled [ downcast ; discouraged ] , ·comforted [ encouraged ] us when Titus [ 2:13 ] came .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	8	[ L For ] Even if my letter [ C Paul ’ s “ severe ” letter that he wrote after his painful visit ; see 2:3–4 ,
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I ·am happy [ rejoice ] , not because you were ·made sad [ grieved ] , but because your sorrow ·made you change your lives [ led to repentance ] . You ·became sad [ grieved ] in the way God wanted you to , so you were not ·hurt by [ or punished because of ] us in any way [ C the Corinthians ’ repentance prevented further sorrow as well as discipline from God ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	10	[ L For ] The kind of sorrow God wants makes people ·change their hearts and lives [ repent ] , leading to salvation , and ·you can not be sorry for that [ or there can be no regret for that kind of sorrow ; L without regret ] . But the kind of sorrow the world has ·brings [ leads to ; results in ] death .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	11	[ L For ] See what this sorrow—the sorrow God wanted you to have—has ·done to [ led to/produced in ] you : It has made you very ·serious [ eager ; earnest ; zealous ] . It made you want to ·restore [ vindicate ; defend ] yourselves . It made you ·angry [ indignant ] and afraid . It made you ·want to see me [ long for reconciliation ] . It made you ·care [ zealous ] . It made you want to ·do the right thing [ see justice done ] . In every way you have ·regained your innocence [ or proved yourselves innocent ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	12	I wrote that letter , not because of the one who did the wrong or because of the person who was ·hurt [ wronged ] . I wrote the letter so you could see , before God , the great ·care [ eagerness ; zeal ] you have for us .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	13	That is why we were ·comforted [ encouraged ] . Not only were we very ·comforted [ encouraged ] , we ·were even happier [ rejoiced even more ] to see that Titus [ 2:13 ] was so ·happy [ joyful ] , because all of you ·made him feel much better [ L refreshed his spirit ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	14	[ L For ] I ·bragged [ boasted ] to Titus about you , and ·you showed that I was right [ L I was not put to shame ] . Everything we said to you was true , and you have proved that what we ·bragged [ boasted ] about to Titus is true .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his ·love [ affection ; feeling ] for you is ·stronger [ greater still ] when he remembers that you were all ready to obey . You ·welcomed [ received ] him with ·respect and fear [ L fear and trembling ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I ·am very happy [ rejoice ] that I can ·trust you fully [ have complete confidence in you ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	2	Corinthians 8:7 in… us Some Greek copies read “ in your love for us . ”
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not commanding you to give . But I want to ·see [ test ; prove ] if your love is true by comparing you with ·others that really want to help [ L the zeal/eagerness of others ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I can ·tell you [ testify ] that they gave as much as they were able and even more than they could afford . No one told them to do it .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	4	But they begged and pleaded with us ·to let them [ L for the privilege/grace to ] share in this service for ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And they gave in a way we did not expect : They first gave themselves to the Lord and to us . ·This is what God wants [ …by the will of God ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we ·asked [ urged ; encouraged ] Titus [ 2:13 ] to help you finish this special work of grace since he is the one who started it .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	7	You ·are rich [ excel ] in everything—in faith , in speaking , in knowledge , in ·truly wanting to help [ eagerness ; zeal ] , and in the love ·you learned [ L that is in you ] from us . [ a ] In the same way , ·be strong [ excel ] also in the grace of giving .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	9	[ L For ] You know the ·grace [ gift ] of our Lord Jesus Christ . Though he was rich , for your sake he became poor so that by his becoming poor you might become rich .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	10	This is ·what I think you should do [ L my opinion on this matter for your benefit ] : Last year you were the first to want to give , and you were the first who gave .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now finish the work you started . Then your · “ doing ” [ L completion ] will be equal to your · “ wanting to do ” [ eager desire ] . Give from what you have .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	12	If you ·want [ are eager/willing ] to give , your gift will be accepted . It will be judged by what you have , not by what you do not have .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	13	[ L For ] We do not want you to have ·troubles [ hardships ; trials ] while other people ·are at ease [ have relief ] , but we want everything to be equal [ C giving is not intended to impoverish the giver , but to distribute God ’ s resources ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	14	At this time ·you have plenty and what you have [ L your abundance ] can help others who are in need . ·Then later , when they have plenty , they [ or In the same way , their abundance ] can help you when you are in need , and all will be equal [ C Paul may be saying , (

EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	16	·I thank [ L Thanks be to ] God because he ·gave [ L put into the heart of ] Titus [ 2:13 ] the same ·love [ L eagerness ; zeal ] for you that I have .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	17	[ L For ] Titus accepted what we asked him to do . He ·wanted very much [ was eager ] to go to you , and this was ·his own idea [ of his own accord ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	18	We are sending with him the brother who is praised by all the churches because of his service ·in preaching the Good News [ L in the Gospel ; C unknown person , possibly Luke ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	19	Also , this brother was ·chosen [ appointed ] by the churches to go with us ·when we deliver this gift of money [ or in this ministry/administration of grace ] . We are doing this ·service [ ministry ] to bring glory to the Lord and to show ·that we really want [ our eagerness/willingness ] to help .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We are being careful so that no one will ·criticize [ blame ] us for the way we are handling this ·large [ abundant ; generous ] gift .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	21	[ L For ] We are trying hard to do what is right , not only before the Lord but also before people [ Prov . 3:4 ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	22	Also , we are sending with them our brother , who has proved to us in many ways that he is always ·ready [ eager ; zealous ] to help . He wants to help even more now , because he has much ·faith [ confidence ] in you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	23	·Now [ or If there is any question ] about Titus [ 2:13 ] —he is my partner ·who is working with me [ and coworker ] to help you . ·And [ or If there is any question ] about the other brothers—they are ·sent [ messengers ] from the churches , and ·they bring glory to [ or they are the glory of ] Christ .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	8	24	So show these men the proof of your love and the reason we ·are proud [ boast ] of you . ·Then [ or …so that ] all the churches can see it . Footnotes -
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	2	[ L For ; Because ] I know ·you want [ your eagerness/willingness ] to help . I have been ·bragging [ boasting ] about this to the ·believers in Macedonia [ L Macedonians ; 8:1 ] , telling them that you in Achaia [ C southern Greece ; 1:1 ] have been ready to give since last year . And your ·desire to give [ L zeal ; enthusiasm ] has ·made most of them ready to give also [ L aroused/provoked the majority ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	9	[ L Just as ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ He ·gives [ L scatters ( seed ) and gives ] freely to the poor . ·The things he does are right and will continue forever [ or His righteousness endures forever ; Ps . 112:9 ] . ”
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I am sending the brothers to you so that our ·bragging [ boasting ] about you in this matter will not be empty words . I want you to be ready , as I said you would be .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	4	If any of the ·believers from Macedonia [ L Macedonians ] come with me and find that you are not ready , we will be ·ashamed [ embarrassed ; dishonored ] that we were so sure of you . ( And you will be ·ashamed [ embarrassed ; dishonored ] , too ! )
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	5	So I thought I should ·ask [ urge ; encourage ] these brothers to go to you before we do . They will finish getting in order the ·generous gift [ blessing ] you promised so it will be ready when we come . And it will be a ·generous gift [ blessing ] —not one ·that you did not want to give [ required from you ; grudgingly given ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Remember this : The person who ·plants a little [ sows sparingly ] will ·have a small harvest [ also reap sparingly ] , but the person who ·plants a lot [ sows generously/bountifully ] will ·have a big harvest [ also reap generously/bountifully ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each of you should give as you have decided in your heart to give . You should not ·be sad when you give [ or give reluctantly ] , and you should not give ·because you feel forced to give [ out of compulsion ] . [ L For ] God loves the person who gives ·happily [ cheerfully ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God can ·give you more blessings than you need [ L overflow/abound all grace to you ] . Then ·you will always have plenty of everything [ L in all things at all times you will have all you need ] — ·enough to give to [ abounding/overflowing in ] every good work .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	10	[ L For ] God is the One who gives seed to the farmer and bread for food . He will ·give you all the seed you need and make it grow [ L supply and multiply your seed ] so there will be a great harvest ·from your goodness [ of your righteousness ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	11	He will make you rich in every way so that you can always give ·freely [ generously ] . And your giving through us will ·cause many to give thanks [ L produce thanksgiving ] to God .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	12	This ·service you do [ L ministry of service ] not only helps the needs of ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] , it also brings many more thanks to God .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	13	It is a proof of your faith . Many people will ·praise [ glorify ] God because you ·obey [ submit to ] the ·Good News [ Gospel ] of Christ—the gospel you ·say you believe [ confess ] —and because you ·freely [ generously ] share with them and with all others .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And when they pray for you , they will ·wish they could be with [ L long for ] you because of the great grace that God has given you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be to God for his ·gift that is too wonderful for words [ indescribable/inexpressible gift ] .

Our weapons have power from God that can destroy ·the enemy ’ s strong places [ L strongholds ; fortresses ] . We destroy ·people ’ s arguments [ human reasoning ; sophistries ]
EXB	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and every ·proud thing [ pretension ; exalted opinion ; L high thing ] that raises itself against the knowledge of God . We capture every thought and make it obey Christ .

EXB	2%20Corinthians	10	14	[ L For ] We are not ·bragging too much [ or going beyond our commission ; L overreaching/overextending ourselves ] , as we would be if we had not already come to you . But we have come to you with the Good News of Christ [ C Paul ’ s opponents claimed the Corinthians were their sphere of ministry ; Paul counters that he first brought the Gospel to Corinth ( Acts

EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	4	You ·are very patient with [ willingly put up with ; gladly tolerate ] anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus from the one we preached . You are very willing to accept a spirit that is different from the Spirit you received , or a gospel that is different from the one you ·accepted [ or received from us ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	5	I do not think that those “ ·great [ super- ] apostles ” are any better than I am .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	6	I may not be a trained speaker , but I do have knowledge . We have shown this to you clearly in every way .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Was it ·wrong [ a sin ] for me to ·humble [ lower ] myself and ·honor [ exalt ; lift up ] you by preaching God ’ s ·Good News [ Gospel ] to you without pay ?
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I accepted pay from other churches , ·taking their money [ L “ robbing ” them ] so I could serve you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	9	If I needed something when I was with you , I did not ·trouble [ burden ] any of you . The brothers who came from Macedonia gave me all that I needed . I did not allow myself to ·depend on [ become a burden to ] you in any way , and I will ·never depend on you [ L keep doing this ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	10	No one in Achaia [ C southern Greece ; 1:1 ] will stop me from ·bragging [ boasting ] about that . ·I say this with the truth of Christ in me [ or By Christ ’ s truth in me ! C a strong vow or oath ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	12	And I will continue doing what I am doing now , because I want to stop those people from having a reason to ·brag [ boast ] . They ·would like [ are looking for an opportunity ] to say that the work they ·brag [ boast ] about is ·the same as [ equal to ] ours .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	13	Such men are ·not true apostles [ false apostles ; pseudo-apostles ] but are ·workers who lie [ deceitful workers ] . ·They change themselves to look like [ …disguising themselves as ; …masquerading as ] apostles of Christ .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	14	·This does not surprise us [ And no wonder , since… ] . Even Satan ·changes himself to look like [ disguises himself as ; masquerades as ] an ·angel [ messenger ] of light [ C trying to fool people into thinking he is from God , who is pure light ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	15	So it does not surprise us if Satan ’ s servants also ·make themselves look like [ masquerade as ] servants ·who work for what is right [ of righteousness ] . But ·in the end they will be punished for what they do [ L their end will match their deeds ] . Paul Tells About His Sufferings
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I tell you again : No one should think I am a fool . But if you think so , accept me as you would accept a fool . Then I can ·brag [ boast ] a little , too .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	17	·When I brag because I feel sure of myself [ By boasting so confidently ] , I am not talking ·as the Lord would talk [ or with the Lord ’ s authority ; L according to the Lord ] but as a fool .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Many people are ·bragging [ boasting ] ·about their lives in the world [ or as the world does ; or by human standards ; L according to the flesh ] . So I will ·brag [ boast ] too .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	19	You are wise , so you will gladly be patient with fools ! [ C Paul sarcastically suggests that the “ wise ” Corinthians , who listened to the false apostles , would surely listen to his “ foolishness. ” ]
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	20	You ·are even patient [ bear ; put up ] with those who ·order you around [ L enslave you ] , or ·use you [ exploit you ; L devour ( your possessions ) ] , or ·trick [ take advantage of ] you , or ·think they are better than you [ act arrogantly ; put on airs ] , or ·hit [ slap ] you in the face .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	21	It is shameful to me to say this , but we were too “ weak ” to do those things to you ! But if anyone else ·is brave enough [ dares ] to ·brag [ boast ] , then I also will ·be brave and brag [ dare to boast ] . ( I am talking as a fool . )

EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three different times I was beaten with rods [ C a Roman punishment ] . One time I was almost stoned to death [ Acts 14:19 ] . Three times I was in ships that wrecked , and one of those times I spent a night and a day in the sea [ C Paul ’ s shipwreck in Acts

I have been in danger in cities , in ·places where no one lives [ the desert/wilderness ] , and on the sea . And I have been in danger with false ·Christians [ L brothers ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Besides all this , there is on me every day the ·load [ pressure ] of my ·concern [ anxiety ] for all the churches .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	29	I feel weak every time someone is weak [ L Who is weak , and I am not weak ? ] , and ·I feel upset every time someone is led into sin [ L Who is led into sin , and I am not indignant/L burning ( with anger ) ? ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must ·brag [ boast ] , I will ·brag [ boast ] about the things that show I am weak .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ , who is to be praised forever , knows I am not lying .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	32	When I was in Damascus , the ·governor [ L ethnarch ; C a title for a minor ruler ] under King Aretas wanted to arrest me , so he put guards around the city .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	11	33	But ·my friends lowered me [ L I was lowered ] in a basket through ·a hole [ or window ] in the city wall . So I escaped from ·the governor [ L his hands ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I know a man in Christ [ C a believer ] who was ·taken up [ caught up ; snatched away ] to the third heaven [ C the presence of God ] fourteen years ago [ C Paul is indirectly referring to himself ] . I do not know whether the man was in his body or out of his body , but God knows .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	12	·When I was with you , I patiently did the things that prove I am an apostle [ L The signs of an apostle were performed among you , with all patience/perseverance ] —signs , wonders , and ·miracles [ powerful deeds ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	7	So that I would not become too proud ·of the wonderful things that were shown to me [ or because of these extraordinary revelations ; C this phrase may be part of the previous sentence ] , a ·painful physical problem [ L thorn in the flesh ] was given to me . This problem was a messenger from Satan , sent to ·beat [ torment ; harrass ; trouble ] me and keep me from being too proud .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	8	I ·begged [ pleaded with ] the Lord three times ·to take this problem away from [ L that it might leave ] me .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	9	But he said to me , “ My grace is ·enough for you [ sufficient for you ; all you need ] . ·When you are weak , my power is made perfect in you [ L For ( my ) power is perfected in weakness ] . ” So I am very happy to ·brag [ boast ] about my weaknesses . Then Christ ’ s power can ·live [ reside ; or rest ] in me .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	10	For this reason I am ·happy [ pleased ; content ] when I have weaknesses , insults , ·hard times [ times of need ] , ·sufferings [ persecutions ] , and ·all kinds of troubles [ distress ] ·for [ for the sake of ] Christ . Because when I am weak , then I am truly strong . Paul ’ s Love for the Christians
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have ·been talking like [ L become ] a fool , but you ·made me [ compelled me to ] do it . You are the ones who should ·say good things about [ have commended ] me . Even if I am ·worth nothing [ L nothing ] , I am not at all inferior to those “ ·great [ super- ] apostles. ”
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	13	In what way were you treated worse than the rest of the churches , except that I was not a burden to you ? Forgive me for this ·wrong [ injustice ] !
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	14	[ T Behold ; L Look ] I am now ready to visit you the third time [ 2:1 ,

EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	15	So I ·am happy to [ most gladly ] ·give everything I have for you , even myself [ L spend and be spent for your lives/souls ] . If I love you more , will you love me less ?
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	16	·It is clear [ Granting that ; or Be that as it may ] I was not a burden to you , but ·you think I was tricky and lied to catch you [ L being so crafty , I took you by deceit ! ; C Paul is being sarcastic ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I ·cheat [ take advantage of ] you by using any of the messengers I sent to you ? [ C The Greek question assumes a negative answer . ]
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I ·asked [ urged ; encouraged ] Titus [ 2:13 ] to go to you , and I sent our brother with him [ 8:18 ,

EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	19	·Do you think we have been defending ourselves to you all this time [ or All this time have you been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you ] ? We have been speaking in Christ and ·before [ in the presence of ] God , ·dear friends [ beloved ] , and everything we do is to ·make you stronger [ build you up ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	20	[ L For ] I am afraid that when I come , you will not be what I want you to be , and I will not be what you want me to be .

EXB	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid that when I come to you again , my God will ·make me ashamed [ or humble/humiliate me ] before you . I may ·be saddened by [ or mourn/grieve over ] many of those who have sinned because they have not ·changed their hearts or turned [ repented ] from their ·impurity [ uncleanness ] , sexual sins and the ·shameful things [ debauchery ; licentiousness ] they have done .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	2	When I was with you the second time [ 2:1–2 ] , I gave a warning to those who had sinned . Now I am away from you , and I give a warning to all the others . When I come to you again , I will not ·be easy with [ spare ] them .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All ·of God ’ s holy people [ T the saints ] send greetings to you .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	3	·You want [ or …since you are demanding ] proof that Christ is speaking through me . My proof is that he is not weak among you , but he is powerful .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	4	It is true that he was weak when he was ·killed on the cross [ crucified ] , but he lives now by God ’ s power . It is true that we are weak in Christ , but ·for you [ or when dealing with you ; or in your presence ] we will be alive with Christ by God ’ s power [ C Christ ’ s resurrection turns weakness into strength ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	5	·Test [ Examine ] yourselves to see if you are ·living in [ L in ] the faith . ·Look closely at [ Test ; Examine ] yourselves . ·You [ L Or don ’ t you… ? ] know that Jesus Christ is in you—·unless [ or if not , ] you fail the test .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I hope you will see that we ourselves have not failed the test .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	7	We pray to God that you will not do anything ·wrong [ evil ] . It is not important ·to see [ that people see ; or for it to appear ] that we have passed the test , but it is important that you do what is ·right [ good ] , even if it seems we have failed .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	8	[ L For ] We can not do anything against the truth , but only for the truth .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	9	We ·are happy to be [ rejoice whenever we are ] weak , if you are strong , and we pray that you will become ·complete [ mature ; or fully equipped/restored ] .
EXB	2%20Corinthians	13	10	I am writing this while I am away from you so that when I come I will not have to be ·harsh [ severe ] in my use of authority . The Lord gave me this authority to build you up , not to tear you down .

EXB	Galatians	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ,
EXB	Galatians	1	4	who gave himself for our sins to ·free [ rescue ; deliver ] us from this ·evil world we live in [ present evil age ] , as God the Father ·planned [ willed ; desired ] .
EXB	Galatians	1	5	·The glory belongs to God [ L …to whom be glory ] forever and ever . Amen . The Only Good News
EXB	Galatians	1	6	I am amazed that you are so quickly ·turning away from [ deserting ; forsaking ] ·God [ L the one ] who called you by ·his grace given through Christ [ L the grace of Christ ] , and are believing ·something different than the Good News [ L a different Gospel ] .
EXB	Galatians	1	7	·Really , there is no other Good News [ L …which is not another ] . But some people are ·confusing [ troubling ; disturbing ] you ; they want to ·change [ distort ] the ·Good News [ Gospel ] of Christ .
EXB	Galatians	1	8	But even if we ourselves or an angel from heaven were to preach to you a different message than the Good News we preached , ·we should be [ L let him be ] ·judged guilty [ condemned ; accursed ; L anathema ] !
EXB	Galatians	1	9	] .
EXB	Galatians	1	10	Do you think I am now trying to ·make people accept me [ seek human favor/acceptance ] ? ·No , God is the One I am trying to please [ L …or ( the favor of ) God ? ] . Am I trying to please people ? If I still wanted to please people , I would not be a ·servant [ slave ; bondservant ] of Christ . Paul ’ s Authority Is from God
EXB	Galatians	1	11	Brothers and sisters , I want you to know that the ·Good News [ Gospel ] I preached to you was not ·made up by human beings [ devised by man ; of human origin ] .
EXB	Galatians	1	12	I did not get it from ·humans [ a human source ; man ] , nor did anyone teach it to me , but ·Jesus Christ showed it to me [ L by a revelation of/from/about Jesus Christ ; Acts
EXB	Galatians	1	13	[ L For ] You have heard about my past life in the Jewish religion . I ·attacked [ intensely/severely persecuted ] the church of God and tried to destroy it .
EXB	Galatians	1	14	I was ·becoming a leader in the Jewish religion [ L advancing/progressing in Judaism ] , doing better than most other Jews of my age . I ·tried harder than anyone else [ was exceedingly zealous ] to follow the ·teachings handed down by our [ traditions of my ] ·ancestors [ forefathers ] .
EXB	Galatians	1	15	But God ·set me apart [ or chose/appointed me ] for his work ·even before I was born [ L from my mother ’ s womb ] . He called me through his grace
EXB	Galatians	1	16	and ·showed [ revealed ] his son to me so that I might ·tell the Good News [ preach the Gospel ] about him to the Gentiles [ Acts 9:15 ; 22:21 ] . When God called me , I did not ·get advice or help from [ confer/consult with ] ·any person [ L flesh and blood ] .
EXB	Galatians	1	17	I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was . ·But [ Instead ; Rather ] I went away to Arabia [ C probably the Nabatean kingdom south of Damascus ] and later went back to Damascus .
EXB	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to ·meet [ get to know ; or confer with ; gain information from ] ·Peter [ L Cephas , Peter ’ s name in Aramaic ; John 1:42 ] and stayed with him for fifteen days .
EXB	Galatians	1	19	I ·met [ or saw ] no other apostles , except James [ Acts 12:17 ; 15:13–21 ; 21:18 ; James 1:1 ] , the brother of the Lord .
EXB	Galatians	1	20	·God knows that [ or I swear before God that ; L Before God , ] these things I write are not lies .
EXB	Galatians	1	21	Later , I went to the areas of Syria [ C a Roman province north of Israel ] and Cilicia [ C a Roman province in present-day southeastern Turkey ; Paul ’ s hometown Tarsus was in Cilicia ] .
EXB	Galatians	1	22	In Judea the churches in Christ had never met me .
EXB	Galatians	1	23	They had only heard it said , “ This man who was ·attacking [ persecuting ] us is now preaching the same faith that he once tried to destroy. ”
EXB	Galatians	1	24	And these believers ·praised [ glorified ] God because of me .
EXB	Galatians	2	2	I went because ·God showed me I should go [ L of a revelation ] . There I met in private with ·the leaders of the church [ or those who seemed to be leaders ; or the prominent/influential ones ] and I ·told [ presented to ; set before ] them the ·Good News [ Gospel ] that I preach to the Gentiles . ·I did not want my past work and the work I am now doing to be wasted [ L …to make sure I was not running or had run in vain ] .

EXB	Galatians	2	30	; 13:2–4 ; 15:36–39 ] . I also took Titus [
EXB	Galatians	2	3	Titus was with me , but he was not ·forced [ compelled ] to be circumcised [ Gen.
EXB	Galatians	2	17	·We Jews came to Christ , trying to be made right with God , and it became clear that we are sinners , too [ or But if we ourselves , also , by seeking to be justified in Christ , were found to be sinners… ] . Does this mean that Christ ·encourages [ L is a servant/minister of ] sin ? ·No [ Absolutely not ; May it never be ] !
EXB	Galatians	2	4	·We talked about this problem [ This issue arose ] because some false ·believers [ L brothers ] had come into our group secretly . They came in ·like spies to overturn [ to sabotage ; L to spy on ] the freedom we have in Christ Jesus . They wanted to make us slaves .
EXB	Galatians	2	5	But we did not give in to ·those false believers [ L them ] for a minute , so that the truth of the ·Good News [ Gospel ] would ·continue [ be preserved ; not be compromised ] for you .
EXB	Galatians	2	6	Those leaders who ·seemed to be important [ or were prominent/influential ] did not ·change the Good News that I preach [ or add anything to my message ] . ( It doesn ’ t matter to me if they were · “ important ” [ prominent ; influential ] or not . To God everyone is the same . )
EXB	Galatians	2	7	But these leaders saw that I had been ·given the work of telling the Good News [ L entrusted with the Gospel ] to the ·Gentiles [ non-Jewish people ; L uncircumcised ] , just as Peter ·had the work of telling the Jews [ L to the circumcised ] .
EXB	Galatians	2	8	[ L For ] ·God [ L The one ] who gave Peter the power to work as an apostle for the ·Jewish people [ L circumcised ] also gave me the power to work as an apostle for the Gentiles .
EXB	Galatians	2	9	James , Peter , and John , who seemed to be ·the leaders [ L pillars ] , ·understood [ recognized ; acknowledged ] that God had given me this special grace , so they ·accepted [ shook hands in partnership with ; L gave the right hand of fellowship/partnership to ] Barnabas and me . They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles and they would go to the ·Jewish people [ L circumcised ] .
EXB	Galatians	2	10	The only thing they asked us was to remember to help the poor [ C meaning especially the poor believers in Jerusalem ; Acts 11:27–30 ] —something I ·really wanted [ myself was eager/zealous ] to do . Paul Shows that Peter Was Wrong
EXB	Galatians	2	11	] in front of them all . I said , “ You are a Jew , but you are living like a Gentile and not a Jew . So how can you now try to force Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
EXB	Galatians	2	12	[ L For ; Because ] ·Peter [ L He ] ate with the Gentiles until ·some Jewish people [ L certain people ] sent from James [ 1:19 ] came to Antioch [ C a major city in Syria ] . When they arrived , Peter ·stopped eating with those who weren ’ t Jewish [ L backed off ; withdrew ] , and he separated himself from them . [ …because ] He was afraid of the ·Jews [ circumcised ; or the pro-circumcision group ] .
EXB	Galatians	2	13	Then the rest of the ·Jewish believers [ L Jews ] joined him in this hypocrisy . Even Barnabas was ·influenced [ swept along ; carried away ] by their hypocrisy .
EXB	Galatians	2	14	[ L But ] When I saw they were not ·following [ acting in line with ] the truth of the ·Good News [ Gospel ] , I spoke to ·Peter [ L Cephas ; v.
EXB	Galatians	2	15	We were not born as Gentile “ sinners , ” but as Jews .
EXB	Galatians	2	16	Yet we know that a person is ·made right with God [ justified ; declared righteous ] not by ·following [ L the works of ] the law , but by ·trusting in [ faith in ; or the faithfulness of ] Jesus Christ . So we , too , have put our faith in Christ Jesus , that we might be ·made right with God [ justified ; declared righteous ] ·because we trusted in [ through faith in ; or because of the faithfulness of ] Christ . It is not ·because we followed [ L by the works of ] the law , because no ·one [ human being ; L flesh ] can be ·made right with God [ justified ; declared righteous ] by ·following [ L the works of ] the law .
EXB	Galatians	2	18	But I would ·really be wrong [ or prove myself to be a lawbreaker/sinner ] ·to begin teaching again those things that I gave up [ L if I rebuild those things I tore down ; C dependance on the law for salvation ] .
EXB	Galatians	2	19	·It was the law that put me to death [ or Trying to keep the law condemned me to death ; L For through the law I died to the law ] , and I died to the law so that I can now live for God [ C no longer depending on the law for salvation , Paul now depends on God ’ s grace ] .
EXB	Galatians	2	20	I ·was put to death on the cross [ L have been crucified ] with Christ , and I do not live anymore—it is Christ who lives in me . I still live in my ·body [ flesh ] , but I live ·by faith in [ or because of the faithfulness of ] the Son of God who loved me and gave himself ·to save me [ L for me ; on my behalf ] .
EXB	Galatians	2	21	By saying these things I ·am not going against [ L do not set aside/nullify ] God ’ s grace . ·Just the opposite [ L For… ] , if the law could make us right with God , then Christ ’ s death would be ·useless [ in vain ; for nothing ] .
EXB	Galatians	3	3	·Are you so foolish [ How can you be so stupid ] ? You began ·your life in Christ by [ L by ; or through ] the Spirit . Now are you trying to ·make it complete [ finish ; or be perfected ] by ·your own power [ human effort ; L the flesh ] ?
EXB	Galatians	3	2	] .
EXB	Galatians	3	4	] . ”
EXB	Galatians	3	5	Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you ·because you follow [ L by the works of ] the law ? ·No , he does these things [ L …or ] ·because you heard the Good News and believed it [ by your believing what you heard ; v.
EXB	Galatians	3	6	·The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham [ L Just as ( it says ) ] : “ Abraham believed God , and ·God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God [ L it ( Abraham ’ s faith ) was credited to him as righteousness ; Gen. 15:6 ; Rom .
EXB	Galatians	3	7	So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith .
EXB	Galatians	3	8	·The Scriptures , telling what would happen in the future , said [ L Scripture foresaw ; C Scripture is personified as foreseeing and speaking ] that God would ·make the Gentiles right [ justify the Gentiles ] through their faith . This ·Good News was told [ Gospel was proclaimed ] to Abraham beforehand , as the Scripture says : “ All nations will be blessed through you [ Gen. 12:3 ; 18:18 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	3	9	So all who ·believe as Abraham believed [ rely on faith ; have faith ; L are of faith ] are blessed ·just as Abraham was [ L with faithful Abraham ; or with Abraham , the man of faith ] .
EXB	Galatians	3	10	·But [ L For ] those who depend on ·following [ L the works of ] the law to make them right are under a curse , because the Scriptures say , “ ·Anyone [ All ; Everyone ] will be cursed who does not ·always obey what [ keep doing everything that ] is written in the Book of the Law [ Deut . 27:26 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	3	11	Now it is clear that no one can be ·made right with [ justified/declared righteous before ] God by the law , because the Scriptures say , “ ·Those who are right with God will live by faith [ The righteous will live by faith ; or Those made righteous by faith will live ; Gen. 15:6 ; Hab . 2:4 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	3	12	The law is not based on faith . ·It says [ L Rather ; On the contrary ] , “ A person who ·obeys [ does ; practices ] these things will ·live because of [ gain life by/in ] them [ Lev . 18:5 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	3	13	Christ ·took away [ redeemed us from ; bought our freedom from ] the curse ·the law put on us [ L of the law ] . ·He changed places with us and put himself under that curse [ L …by becoming a curse for us ] . [ L For ; Because ] It is written in the Scriptures , “ Anyone ·whose body is displayed [ L who is hung ] on a tree is cursed [ Deut . 21:23 ; C an executed man ’ s body was hung on a stake or tree for humiliation and warning ; Paul here applies it to Christ ’ s crucifixion as the curse/judgment for our sin ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	3	14	Christ did this so that God ’ s blessing promised to Abraham [ Gen. 12:2–3 ] might come through Jesus Christ to the Gentiles . ·Jesus died so that by our believing [ …so that by faith ] we could receive the Spirit that God promised . The Law and the Promise
EXB	Galatians	3	15	Brothers and sisters , let us think ·in human terms [ or of an example from everyday life ; L according to man ] : Even in the case of a human ·agreement [ covenant ; or will and testament ] , after it has been ·accepted [ ratified ; put into affect ] no one can ·set it aside [ annul it ] or add anything to it .
EXB	Galatians	3	16	God made promises both to Abraham and to his ·descendant [ seed ] . God did not say , “ and to your ·descendants [ seeds ] . ” That would mean many people . But God said , “ and to your ·descendant [ seed ; Gen. 12:7 ; 13:15 ; 17:7 ; 24:7 ] . ” That means only one person ; that person is Christ .
EXB	Galatians	3	17	This is what I mean : The law , which came four hundred thirty years later , can not ·change [ cancel ; nullify ] that ·agreement [ covenant ] previously made by God and so ·destroy [ nullify ; render invalid ] God ’ s promise to Abraham .
EXB	Galatians	3	18	If the law could give us ·Abraham ’ s blessing [ L the inheritance ] , then ·the promise would not be necessary [ or it is not based on a promise ] . But that is not possible , because God freely gave ·his blessings [ L it ] to Abraham through the promise he had made .
EXB	Galatians	3	19	So what was the law for ? It was ·given to show that the wrong things people do are against God ’ s will [ L added because of transgressions ] . And it continued until the ·special descendant [ seed ] , who had been promised , came . The law was given through angels [ Acts 7:53 ; Heb . 2:2 ] ·who used Moses for a mediator to give the law to people [ L by the hand of a mediator/intermediary ] .
EXB	Galatians	3	20	But a mediator is not needed when there is only one side , and God is only one . The Purpose of the Law of Moses
EXB	Galatians	3	21	Does this mean that the law is against God ’ s promises ? ·Never [ Absoluely not ; May it never be ] ! That would be true only if the law could make us ·right with God [ righteous ] . But God did not give a law that can bring life .
EXB	Galatians	3	22	Instead , the Scriptures ·showed that the whole world is bound by sin [ L imprisoned all things under ( the power of ) sin ; C Scripture is personified as the jailer ] . This was so the promise would be given ·through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ [ or because of Christ ’ s faithfulness , to all who believe ] .
EXB	Galatians	3	23	Before this faith came , we were all held prisoners by the law . We ·had no freedom [ were locked up ] until ·God showed us the way of faith that was coming [ L the coming faith would be revealed ] .
EXB	Galatians	3	24	] .
EXB	Galatians	3	25	Now ·the way of faith [ L faith ] has come , and we no longer live under a ·guardian [ child-minder ; tutor ; v.
EXB	Galatians	3	26	[ L For ] ·You are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus [ or In Christ Jesus you are all children/sons of God through faith ] .
EXB	Galatians	3	27	[ L For ] All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ .
EXB	Galatians	3	28	In Christ , there is ·no difference between Jew and Greek [ L neither Jew nor Greek ] , slave and free person , male and female . You are all ·the same [ or united ; L one ] in Christ Jesus .
EXB	Galatians	3	29	·You [ L If you… ] belong to Christ , so you are Abraham ’ s ·descendants [ seed ] . ·You will inherit all of God ’ s blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham [ L …heirs according to the promise ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	4	But when the ·right [ appropriate ; or appointed ; L fullness of ] time came , God sent his Son who was born of a woman and ·lived [ L born ] under the law .
EXB	Galatians	4	2	They must obey ·those chosen to care for them [ L their guardians and administrators/trustees ] until the time set by their father .
EXB	Galatians	4	3	] you followed before ? Do you want to be slaves to those things again ?
EXB	Galatians	4	5	God did this so he could ·buy freedom for [ redeem ] those who were under the law and so we could ·become his children [ or receive adoption as heirs ; C a Roman legal term for adopting an heir to carry on one ’ s name ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	6	Since you are God ’ s ·children [ or sons ] , God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , and the Spirit cries out , “ Abba [ C Aramaic for “ Father , ” a term of intimacy ] , Father. ”
EXB	Galatians	4	7	So you are no longer a slave ; you are God ’ s ·child [ or son ] , and ·because you are his child , God will give you the blessing he promised [ L if a son/child , then also an heir through God ] . Paul ’ s Love for the Christians
EXB	Galatians	4	8	In the past you did not know God . You were slaves to gods that were not real .
EXB	Galatians	4	9	But now you know the true God . Really , it is God who knows you . So ·why do [ L how can ] you turn back to those weak and ·useless [ bankrupt ; L poor ] ·rules [ or spiritual forces ; or elementary principles/powers ; v.
EXB	Galatians	4	10	You still ·follow teachings about [ are observing/keeping ] special days , months , seasons , and years [ C probably Jewish Sabbaths and festivals , which Paul ’ s opponents claimed must be observed to be saved ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you , that my work for you has been wasted .
EXB	Galatians	4	12	Brothers and sisters , I became like you [ C living like a Gentile to win them to Christ ;
EXB	Galatians	4	1	Cor . 9:21 ] , so I beg you to become like me [ C depending on God ’ s grace , not the Jewish law , for salvation ] . You ·were very good to me before [ L did me no wrong ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	13	You remember that it was because of an illness that I came to you the first time , preaching the ·Good News [ Gospel ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	14	Though my sickness was a ·trouble for you [ trial for you ; or test of your concern ] , you did not ·hate [ despise ] me or ·make me leave [ reject me ] . Instead , you welcomed me as an angel from God , as if I were Christ Jesus himself !
EXB	Galatians	4	15	But where is that ·joy [ happiness ; blessedness ] you had then ? I am ready to testify that you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me if that were possible .
EXB	Galatians	4	16	] . But the son from the free woman was born ·because of the promise God made to Abraham [ L through the promise ; C Isaac ; Gen.
EXB	Galatians	4	17	;
EXB	Galatians	4	18	It is good ·for people to show interest in you [ or to be passionate/enthusiastic ; L to be zealous/the object of zeal ] , but only if their ·purpose [ intention ] is good . This is always true , not just when I am with you .
EXB	Galatians	4	19	My little children , again I feel the pain of childbirth for you until ·you truly become like Christ [ L Christ is formed in you ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	20	I wish I could be with you now and could change ·the way I am talking to you [ or my tone of voice ; L my voice ] , because I ·do not know what to think about [ or don ’ t know how to help ; or am perplexed/at wit ’ s end about ] you . The Example of Hagar and Sarah
EXB	Galatians	4	21	] .
EXB	Galatians	4	22	[ L For ] The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons . The mother of one son was a slave woman , and the mother of the other son was a free woman .
EXB	Galatians	4	23	Abraham ’ s son from the slave woman was born ·in the normal human way [ or through human effort/plan ; L according to the flesh ; C Ishmael ; Gen.
EXB	Galatians	4	24	This story ·teaches something else [ or may be read allegorically/figuratively/as an illustration ] : The two women are ·like the two agreements between God and his people [ L two covenants ] . One is ·the law that God made on Mount Sinai [ L from Mount Sinai ; C the mountain in Arabia where God delivered his law to Israel through Moses ; Ex . 19—31 ] , ·and the people who are under this agreement are like slaves [ L …bearing children for slavery ] . ·The mother named Hagar is like that agreement [ L This is Hagar ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	25	She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and ·is a picture of [ corresponds to ; represents ] the ·earthly city of [ L present ] Jerusalem . This city and ·its people [ L her children ] are ·slaves to the law [ L slaves ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	26	But the ·heavenly Jerusalem , which is above [ L Jerusalem above ] , is like the free woman . She is our mother .
EXB	Galatians	4	27	[ L For ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ ·Be happy [ Rejoice ] , barren one [ C Jerusalem ] . You are like a woman who never gave birth to children . ·Start singing [ Burst out ] and ·shout for joy [ cry out ] . You never ·felt the pain of giving birth [ or went into labor ] , but you who are ·childless [ L desolate ; or deserted ] will have more children than the woman who has a husband [ Is . 54:1 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	4	28	My brothers and sisters , you are ·God ’ s children because of his promise [ L children of the promise ] , as Isaac was then .
EXB	Galatians	4	29	[ L For just as ] The son who was born ·in the normal way [ or through human effort/plan ; L according to the flesh ] treated the other son badly . It is the same today [ C a reference to Jewish persecution of Christians ] .
EXB	Galatians	4	30	But what does the Scripture say ? “ Throw out the slave woman and her son . The son of the slave woman will not share in the inheritance with the son of the free woman [ Gen. 21:10 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	4	31	So , my brothers and sisters , we are not children of the slave woman , but of the free woman .
EXB	Galatians	5	5	For by the Spirit and through faith we wait eagerly for ·a right relationship with God [ L righteousness ] —the object of our hope .
EXB	Galatians	5	2	Listen , I Paul tell you that if you ·go back to the law by being [ L let yourself be ] circumcised , Christ does you no good .
EXB	Galatians	5	3	Again , I warn every man : If you allow yourselves to be circumcised , you ·must follow [ are obligated to obey ] all the law .
EXB	Galatians	5	4	If you try to be ·made right with God [ justified ] through the law , ·your life with Christ is over [ L you are alienated/separated/severed from Christ ] —you have ·left [ fallen away from ] God ’ s grace .
EXB	Galatians	5	6	·When we are [ L For ] in Christ Jesus , ·it is not important if we are circumcised or not [ L neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything ] . The important thing is faith—the kind of faith that works through love .
EXB	Galatians	5	7	You were running a good race . Who ·stopped [ hindered ] you from ·following [ or obeying ; or your conviction about ] the ·true way [ truth ] ?
EXB	Galatians	5	8	This ·change [ persuasion ; enticement ] did not come from the One who ·chose [ called ] you .
EXB	Galatians	5	9	Be careful ! “ Just a little ·yeast [ leaven ;
EXB	Galatians	5	1	Cor . 5:6–7 ] makes the whole batch of dough rise [ C a little error will spread through the whole community ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	5	10	But I ·trust [ L have confidence/am persuaded about you ] in the Lord that you will ·not believe those different ideas [ take no different view ] . Whoever is ·confusing [ troubling ] you with such ideas will ·be punished [ pay the penalty ; L bear the condemnation ] , ·no matter who he is [ L whoever he may be ] .
EXB	Galatians	5	11	My brothers and sisters , if I am still preaching ·that a man must be circumcised [ L circumcision ; C some were evidently accusing Paul of this ] , why am I still being ·attacked [ persecuted ] ? If I still taught circumcision , ·my preaching about the cross would not be a problem [ the scandal/offense of the cross has been removed/abolished ] .
EXB	Galatians	5	12	I wish the people who are bothering you would ·castrate themselves [ make themselves eunuchs ; L cut it off ] ! [ C Paul sarcastically says that if circumcision is so helpful , why not go even further ? ]
EXB	Galatians	5	13	My brothers and sisters , God called you to ·be free [ L freedom ] , but do not use your freedom as an ·excuse to do what pleases [ opportunity/occasion for ] your ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; flesh ] . [ L But ; Rather ] Serve each other with love .
EXB	Galatians	5	14	[ L For ] The whole law is ·made complete [ summed up ; fulfilled ] in this one command : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself [ Lev . 19:18 ] . ”
EXB	Galatians	5	15	[ L But ] If you go on ·hurting each other and tearing each other apart [ L biting and devouring one another ] , be careful , or you will completely ·destroy [ or consume ] each other . The Spirit and Human Nature
EXB	Galatians	5	16	So I tell you : ·Live [ Walk ] ·by following [ guided by ; in the power of ; L by ] the Spirit . Then you will not do what your ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] ·wants [ desires ; craves ] .
EXB	Galatians	5	17	Our ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] ·wants [ desires ] what is against the Spirit , and the Spirit ·wants [ desires ] what is against our ·sinful self [ sinful nature ; T flesh ] . [ L For ] The two are ·against [ opposed to ; or hostile toward ] each other , so you can not do just what you ·please [ want ] .
EXB	Galatians	5	18	But if the Spirit is leading you , you are not under the law .
EXB	Galatians	5	19	The ·wrong things the sinful self does [ works of the flesh/sinful nature ] are ·clear [ evident ; obvious ] : ·being sexually unfaithful [ sexual immorality ] , ·not being pure [ impurity ] , ·taking part in sexual sins [ depravity ; promiscuity ] ,
EXB	Galatians	5	20	·worshiping gods [ idolatry ] , ·doing witchcraft [ sorcery ] , ·hating [ hostility ; antagonism ] , ·making trouble [ discord ; strife ] , being jealous , ·being angry [ rage ] , ·being selfish [ rivalries ] , ·making people angry with each other [ dissensions ] , ·causing divisions among people [ factions ] ,
EXB	Galatians	5	21	feeling envy , being drunk , ·having wild and wasteful parties [ carousings ; orgies ] , and doing other things like these . I warn you now as I warned you before : Those who do these things will not inherit God ’ s kingdom .

EXB	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , self-control . ·There is no law that says these things are wrong [ or No law can oppose such things ] .
EXB	Galatians	5	24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified ·their own sinful selves [ the sinful nature ; the flesh ] . They have given up ·their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do [ L its passions and desires ] .
EXB	Galatians	5	25	·We [ L If/Since we… ] ·get our new life from the Spirit [ live by the Spirit ] , so we should ·follow [ be guided by ; walk in step with ] the Spirit .

EXB	Galatians	6	3	If anyone thinks he is ·important [ L something ] when he really is not , he is only ·fooling [ deceiving ; deluding ] himself .

EXB	Galatians	6	5	Each person ·must be responsible for himself [ L will carry their own load ] .
EXB	Galatians	6	7	Do not be ·fooled [ deceived ; mistaken ] : You can not ·cheat [ mock ; make a fool of ] God . People ·harvest only what they plant [ reap what they sow ] .
EXB	Galatians	6	8	If they plant ·to satisfy [ or in the field of ; L into ; to ] their ·sinful selves [ sinful nature ; flesh ] , ·their sinful selves will bring them ruin [ L they will reap destruction from the flesh ] .

EXB	Ephesians	4	21	·I know that [ L …if indeed ] you heard ·about him [ or him ] , and you ·are in him , so you were taught the truth that is in Jesus [ or were taught by him , because the truth is in Jesus ] .

EXB	Ephesians	5	6	Do not let anyone ·fool [ deceive ] you ·by telling you things that are not true [ or with shallow philosophies ; L with empty words ] , because these things will bring God ’ s ·anger [ wrath ] on ·those who do not obey him [ L the children/sons of disobedience ] .

EXB	Ephesians	5	15	So be very careful how you ·live [ walk ] . Do not ·live [ walk ] like those who are ·not wise [ foolish ] , but ·live wisely [ like those who are wise ] .
EXB	Ephesians	5	16	·Take advantage of every opportunity [ or Make the most of your time ; L …redeeming the time/season ] , because ·these are evil times [ L the days are evil ] .

EXB	Ephesians	5	28	In the same way , husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies . The man who loves his wife loves himself .
EXB	Ephesians	5	29	[ L For ] No one ever hates his own ·body [ T flesh ] , but feeds and takes care of it . And that is what Christ does for the church ,

EXB	Philippians	1	20	I expect and hope that I will not ·fail Christ in [ L be ashamed about ] anything but that I will have the ·courage [ boldness ] now , as always , ·to show the greatness of Christ [ or so that Christ will be exalted ] in my ·life here on earth [ L body ] , whether I live or die .
EXB	Philippians	1	21	[ L For ] To me ·the only important thing about living [ L to live ] is Christ , and ·dying would be profit for me [ L to die is gain/profit ] .
EXB	Philippians	1	22	If I continue living in my ·body [ flesh ] , ·I will be able to work for the Lord [ L this is productive/fruitful work for me ] . I do not know what to choose—living or dying .
EXB	Philippians	1	23	·It is hard to choose [ I am torn/hard pressed ] between the two . I ·want [ desire ; long ] to leave this life and be with Christ , which is much better ,
EXB	Philippians	1	24	but ·you need me here [ or it is better for you that I remain ] in ·my body [ the flesh ] .
EXB	Philippians	1	25	Since I am sure of this , I know I will stay with you ·to help you grow and have [ L for your progress/success and ] joy in your faith .
EXB	Philippians	1	26	[ L …so that ] ·You will be very happy [ or Because of me , your confidence/pride will increase ; L Your boasting in me will abound ] in Christ Jesus when I am with you again .
EXB	Philippians	1	27	·Only one thing concerns me [ or Whatever happens ; L Only ] : Be sure that you ·live [ conduct yourselves ; live as citizens ] in a way that ·brings honor to [ is worthy of ] the ·Good News [ Gospel ] of Christ . ·Then [ L …so that ] whether I come and ·visit [ see ] you or am away from you , I will hear that you are standing strong ·with one purpose [ with one spirit ; or in the one Spirit ] , that you work together ·as one [ with one mind/soul ] for the faith ·of [ or that is ; or in ] the ·Good News [ Gospel ] ,
EXB	Philippians	1	28	and that you are not ·frightened [ intimidated ] in any way by ·those who are against you [ your opponents ] . All of this is ·proof [ evidence ; a sign ] that ·your enemies [ they ] will be destroyed but that you will be saved . And ·this salvation [ or this proof/evidence/sign ; L this ] is from God .
EXB	Philippians	1	29	·God gave you the honor [ L For it has been granted/given to you ] not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for him .
EXB	Philippians	1	30	You yourselves are having the same kind of struggles that you saw ·I had when I was with you [ L in me ] , and ·you hear that I am still having now [ L now hear in me ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	2	·If so [ …then ] , ·make me very happy [ L fulfill/complete my joy ] by ·having the same thoughts [ being like-minded/of one mind ] , sharing the same love , and having one ·mind [ heart ; soul ] and ·purpose [ goal ; mind ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	3	When you do things , do not let ·selfishness [ rivalry ; selfish ambition ] or pride be your guide . Instead , be humble and give more ·honor [ regard ; value ] to others than to yourselves .
EXB	Philippians	2	4	Do not ·be interested only in your own life [ look out for your own interests ] , but ·be interested in the lives of others [ look out for others ’ interests ] . Be Unselfish like Christ
EXB	Philippians	2	5	In your lives you must ·think and act like [ have the same attitude as ] Christ Jesus . [ C What follows may be from an early Christian hymn . ]
EXB	Philippians	2	6	·Christ himself was like God in everything [ L Who , being in the form of God ] . But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be ·used for his own benefit [ or grasped ; seized ; held on to ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	7	But he ·gave up his place with God and made himself nothing [ L emptied himself ] . He ·became like [ L took the form of ] a ·servant [ slave ; bondservant ] and was born ·as a man [ L in the likeness of humanity/men ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	8	And ·when he was living [ L being found in appearance/likeness ] as a ·man [ human being ] , he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God , even ·when that caused his [ to the point of ] death—death on a cross .
EXB	Philippians	2	9	So God ·raised [ exalted ] him to the highest place . God ·made his name [ or gave him the name ] ·greater than [ far above ] every other name
EXB	Philippians	2	10	so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus— everyone in heaven , on earth , and under the earth .
EXB	Philippians	2	11	And ·everyone [ L every tongue ] will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father . Be the People God Wants You to Be
EXB	Philippians	2	12	My ·dear friends [ beloved ] , you have always obeyed God when I was with you . It is even more important that you obey now while I am away from you . ·Keep on working to complete [ Continue working out ] your salvation with ·fear [ awe ; reverence ] and trembling ,
EXB	Philippians	2	13	because God is working in you ·to help you want to do and be able to do [ L both to will/desire and to work ] what pleases him .
EXB	Philippians	2	14	Do everything without ·complaining [ grumbling ] or arguing .
EXB	Philippians	2	15	Then you will be ·innocent [ blameless ] and ·without any wrong [ innocent ; pure ; harmless ] , God ’ s children without ·fault [ blemish ; C as are sacrificial animals ] . ·But you are living with people that are crooked and evil [ L …in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation ; Deut . 32:5 ] , among whom you shine like stars in the ·dark world [ or sky ; L world ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	16	You ·offer [ or hold firmly/fast to ] the ·teaching that gives life [ message/word of life ] . So ·when Christ comes again [ L on the day of Christ ; C judgment day ] , I can ·be happy [ L be proud ; boast ] because I ·ran the race and won [ L did not run for nothing/in vain ] . ·My work was not wasted [ L …nor did I labor for nothing/in vain ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	17	Your faith makes you offer your lives as a sacrifice in serving God . [ L Even ] If I ·have to offer my own blood [ L am poured out as a drink offering ] with your sacrifice , I will be ·happy [ rejoicing ] and full of joy with all of you .
EXB	Philippians	2	18	You also should be ·happy [ rejoicing ] and full of joy with me . Timothy and Epaphroditus
EXB	Philippians	2	19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon . [ L …so that ] I will be ·happy [ encouraged ] to learn how you are .
EXB	Philippians	2	20	I have no one else like Timothy [ 1:1 ] , who ·truly [ genuinely ] cares for you .
EXB	Philippians	2	21	Other people ·are interested only in their own lives [ pursue their own interests/concerns ] , not ·in the work [ the interests/concerns ; L the things ] of Jesus Christ .
EXB	Philippians	2	22	You know ·the kind of person Timothy is [ his tested and proven character ] . You know he has served with me in ·telling the Good News [ L the Gospel ] , as a son serves his father .
EXB	Philippians	2	23	[ L Therefore ] I ·plan [ hope ] to send him to you quickly when I know what will happen to me [ C probably referring to the outcome of Paul ’ s trial in Rome ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	24	I am ·sure [ confident ] ·that the Lord will help me to [ L in the Lord that I will ] come to you soon .
EXB	Philippians	2	25	[ L But ; or Meanwhile , ] I thought ·I should [ it necessary to ] send back to you Epaphroditus [ 4:18 ] , my ·brother in Christ [ L brother ] and coworker , ·who serves with me in Christ ’ s army [ L and fellow soldier ] . He was your messenger , sent as a ·servant [ minister ] to meet my needs .
EXB	Philippians	2	26	I am sending him because he ·wants very much to see [ greatly misses ; L longs for ] all of you . He is ·worried [ distressed ] because you heard that he was sick .
EXB	Philippians	2	27	Yes , he was sick , and nearly died , but God had mercy on him and me too so that I would not have ·more sadness [ L sorrow upon sorrow ] .
EXB	Philippians	2	28	I ·want very much [ am very eager ] to send him to you so that when you see him you can ·be happy [ rejoice ] , and I can stop worrying about you .
EXB	Philippians	2	29	Welcome him in the Lord with much joy . Give honor to people like him ,
EXB	Philippians	2	30	because he almost died for the work of Christ . He risked his life to give me the help you could not give in your service to me .
EXB	Philippians	3	3	[ L For ] We are the ·ones who are truly circumcised [ L ( true ) circumcision ] . We ·worship [ serve ] God ·through [ or in ] his Spirit , and ·our pride is [ we boast/glory ] in Christ Jesus . We do not put ·trust [ reliance ; confidence ] in ·ourselves or anything we can do [ human ability/effort ; T the flesh ] ,
EXB	Philippians	3	2	·Watch out for [ Beware ] those who do evil , ·who are like dogs [ L beware the dogs ; C a derogatory reference to Paul ’ s opponents ] , ·who demand to cut the body [ L beware the mutilation ; C a mocking reference to those who demand circumcision of Gentile believers ] .
EXB	Philippians	3	4	although I might be able to put ·trust [ reliance ; confidence ] in ·myself [ human ability/effort ; T the flesh ] . If anyone thinks he has a reason to ·trust [ rely ; have confidence ] in ·himself [ human ability/effort ; T the flesh ] , he should know that I have greater reason .
EXB	Philippians	3	5	I was circumcised eight days after my birth [ Gen. 17:12 ; Lev . 12:3 ] . I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin . I am a ·Hebrew , and my parents were Hebrews [ or true Hebrew ; Hebrew through and through ; L Hebrew of Hebrews ] . With regard to the ·law of Moses [ L law ] , I was a Pharisee [ C Pharisees strictly followed the OT law and expanded on it with many traditions ] .
EXB	Philippians	3	6	·I was so enthusiastic [ L With regard to ( religious ) zeal , ] I persecuted the church . With regard to ·obedience to the law of Moses [ L righteousness based on the law ] I was ·faultless [ blameless ] .
EXB	Philippians	3	7	Those things were ·important [ valuable ; or assets ] to me , but now I think they are ·worth nothing [ or liabilities ; L a loss ] because of Christ .
EXB	Philippians	3	8	Not only those things , but I think that all things are ·worth nothing [ or liabilities ; L a loss ] ·compared with [ or because of ] the ·greatness [ superior/supreme value ] of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord . Because of him , I have lost all those things , and now I ·know they are [ consider them ] ·worthless trash [ garbage ; refuse ; excrement ] . ·This allows me to have [ L …so that I may gain ] Christ
EXB	Philippians	3	9	and to ·belong to [ be united with ; L be found in ] him . ·Now I am right with God , not because I followed the law [ L …not having my own righteousness from the law ] , but because ·I believed in Christ [ of faith in Christ ; or of the faithfulness of Christ ] . This is the ·right relationship with [ or righteousness of/from ] God that comes through ·faith [ or the faithfulness ( of Christ ) ] .
EXB	Philippians	3	10	I want to know Christ and the power ·that raised him from the dead [ L of his resurrection ] . I want to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death .
EXB	Philippians	3	11	·Then I have hope that [ L …if somehow ] I myself will ·be raised [ reach/attain to the resurrection ] from the dead . Continuing Toward Our Goal
EXB	Philippians	3	12	·I do not mean [ L Not ] that I have already ·achieved [ obtained ; taken hold of ] it or have already ·been perfected [ become mature ; or reached the goal ] . But I keep ·trying [ pressing forward ; striving ; pursuing ] to ·take hold of that for which [ or make it my own because ] Christ ·took hold of me [ or made me his own ] .
EXB	Philippians	3	13	Brothers and sisters , I know that I have not ·yet reached that goal [ taken hold of it ] , but there is one thing I always do . Forgetting the ·past [ L things that are behind ] and ·straining toward [ stretching/reaching forward to ] what is ahead ,
EXB	Philippians	3	14	I keep ·trying to reach [ pursuing ; chasing ] the goal and get the prize for which God called me ·to the life above [ heavenward ; L upward ] ·through [ or in ] Christ Jesus .
EXB	Philippians	3	15	All of us who are ·spiritually mature [ perfect ; complete ] should think this way , too . And if there are things you ·do not agree with [ L think differently about ] , God will ·make them clear [ or reveal this ] to you .
EXB	Philippians	3	16	But we should ·continue following the truth [ or live up to the standard ] we already have .
EXB	Philippians	3	17	Brothers and sisters , ·all of you should try to follow my example [ L become imitators of me ] and ·to copy [ L watch closely ; pay attention to ] those who ·live [ walk ] the way we ·showed [ modeled it for ] you .
EXB	Philippians	3	18	[ L For ] Many people ·live [ walk ] like enemies of the cross of Christ . I have often told you about them , and ·it makes me cry to [ L with tears I ] tell you about them now .
EXB	Philippians	3	19	·In the end , they will be destroyed [ Their end/destiny is destruction ] . ·They do whatever their bodies want [ L Their god is their stomach/belly ] , ·they are proud of their shameful acts [ L their glory is in their shame ] , and they think only about earthly things .
EXB	Philippians	3	20	But our ·homeland [ or citizenship ] is in heaven , and we are waiting for our Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ , to come from heaven .
EXB	Philippians	3	21	By his power to ·rule [ L subject to himself ] all things , he will ·change [ transform ; transfigure ] our humble bodies and make them like his own glorious body .
EXB	Philippians	4	4	·Be full of joy [ Rejoice ] in the Lord always . I will say again , ·be full of joy [ rejoice ] .

EXB	Philippians	4	2	I ·ask [ urge ; encourage ; exhort ] Euodia and Syntyche [ C two women in the Philippian congregation ] to agree in the Lord .
EXB	Philippians	4	3	And I ask you , my ·faithful [ true ; genuine ] ·friend [ companion ; L yoke-partner ; C possibly a proper name : Syzygos ] , to help these women . They ·served [ struggled ; labored ] with me in telling the ·Good News [ Gospel ] , together with Clement and ·others who worked with me [ L the rest of my coworkers ] , whose names are written in the book of life [ Rev . 3:5 ; 21:27 ] .
EXB	Philippians	4	5	Let everyone see that you are ·gentle [ kind ; considerate ; patient ] . The Lord is ·coming soon [ or close at hand ; L near ] .
EXB	Philippians	4	6	Do not ·worry [ be anxious ] about anything , but pray and ·ask God for everything you need [ or make your requests known to God ] , always giving thanks .
EXB	Philippians	4	7	And God ’ s peace , which ·is so great we can not understand it [ transcends/surpasses all comprehension ] , will ·keep [ guard ] your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus .
EXB	Philippians	4	8	[ L Finally ; In conclusion ; or Now then ] Brothers and sisters , ·think about [ focus your thoughts on ; fill your minds with ] things that are true and honorable and ·right [ just ] and pure and ·beautiful [ lovely ] and ·respected [ commendable ] .

EXB	Philippians	4	9	Do what you learned and received and heard ·from [ L in ] me , and what you saw ·me do [ L in me ] . And the God ·who gives [ L of ] peace will be with you . Paul Thanks the Christians
EXB	Philippians	4	10	I ·am very happy [ L rejoiced greatly ] in the Lord that you have ·shown [ renewed ; revived ] your ·care [ concern ] for me again . You continued to ·care [ be concerned ] about me , but ·there was no way for you [ you had no opportunity ] to show it .
EXB	Philippians	4	11	I am not telling you this because I need anything . [ L For ] I have learned to be ·satisfied [ content ] ·whatever the circumstances [ or with whatever I have ] .
EXB	Philippians	4	12	I know how to live when I am ·poor [ in humble circumstances ] , and I know how to live when I have plenty . I have learned the ·secret of being happy [ L secret ] ·at any time in everything that happens [ or in any and all circumstances ] , when I have enough to eat and when I go hungry , when I have ·more than I need [ plenty ; an abundance ] and when I do not have enough .
EXB	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through ·Christ , because he [ L the one who ] gives me strength .

EXB	Philippians	4	16	[ L For ] Even when I was in Thessalonica [ C shortly after leaving Philippi ; Thessalonica is southwest of Philippi ; Acts 17:1–9 ] ·several times [ L both once and twice ] you sent me things I needed .
EXB	Philippians	4	17	Really , it is not that I ·want to receive gifts from you [ L seek the gift ] , but I ·want you to have the good that comes from giving [ L seek the profit/fruit that increases to your account ; C more business terminology ; v.
EXB	Philippians	4	18	And now I have ·everything [ or received full payment ] , and more . I ·have all I need [ or am fully supplied/filled up ] , because Epaphroditus [ 2:25 ] brought your gifts to me . They are ·like a sweet-smelling offering to God [ L a fragrant aroma ] , a sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to him .
EXB	Philippians	4	19	[ L And ] My God will ·meet [ supply ; fulfill ] all of your needs ·from [ L according to ] his ·wonderful riches [ glorious riches ; or riches in heaven/glory ] in Christ Jesus .

EXB	Colossians	1	5	You have this faith and love because of your hope , and what you hope for is ·kept safe [ stored up ; reserved ] for you in heaven . You learned about this hope when you heard the ·message about the truth [ or true message ; L word of truth ] , the ·Good News [ Gospel ]
EXB	Colossians	1	6	that ·was told [ L has come ] to you . [ L …just as ] Everywhere in the world that ·Good News [ Gospel ] is ·bringing blessings [ L bearing fruit ] and is growing . This has happened with you , too , ·since [ L from the day ] you heard and ·understood the truth about [ or truly understood ] the grace of God .
EXB	Colossians	1	7	You learned about ·God ’ s grace [ L it ] from Epaphras , our ·dear [ beloved ; much loved ] fellow ·servant [ slave ; bondservant ] , who is a faithful ·servant [ minister ] of Christ ·for us [ b ] [ on our behalf ] . [ C Epaphras apparently established the church at Colossae during Paul ’ s three-year ministry in Ephesus ; Acts 19:10 . ]
EXB	Colossians	1	8	He also told us about the love you have ·from [ or in ] the Holy Spirit .
EXB	Colossians	1	9	Because of this , since the day we heard about you , we have ·continued [ not ceased ] praying for you , asking God ·that you will know fully what he wants [ L to fill you with the knowledge of his will ] , ·and that you will have great [ L in all ] ·spiritual wisdom and understanding [ or wisdom and understanding from the Spirit ]

EXB	Colossians	1	21	At one time you were ·separated [ alienated ; estranged ] from God . You were his enemies in your minds , ·and the evil things you did were against God [ or because of your evil deeds ] .
EXB	Colossians	1	22	But now God has ·made you his friends again [ reconciled you ] through Christ ’ s death in ·the body [ his physical body ; L the body of his flesh ] , so that he might bring you into God ’ s presence as people who are holy , ·with no wrong [ without blemish ; C as were sacrificial animals ] , and ·with nothing of which God can judge you guilty [ blameless ; innocent ; free of accusation ] .

[ C By suffering while spreading the Gospel , Paul both participates in Christ ’ s death and helps complete God ’ s plan . ]
EXB	Colossians	1	25	I became a ·servant [ minister ] of the church because God gave me a ·special work to do [ stewardship ; commission ] ·that helps you [ L for you ] , and that work is to ·tell fully [ or complete ; or preach everywhere ; L fulfill ] the ·message [ word ] of God .
EXB	Colossians	1	26	This message is the ·secret [ mystery ; C something God had not previously disclosed ; Eph . 1:9 ] that was hidden from ·everyone since the beginning of time [ L ages and generations ] , but now it is made known to ·God ’ s holy people [ T the saints ] .
EXB	Colossians	1	27	God ·decided [ chose ; willed ] to let his people know this rich and glorious ·secret [ mystery ; 1:26 ] which he has for ·all people [ the nations/Gentiles ] . This ·secret [ mystery ] is ·that Christ lives in you . He is our only hope for glory [ L Christ in you , the hope of glory ] .

EXB	1%20Timothy	5	12	They will be judged for ·not doing what they first promised to do [ breaking/despising their first pledge ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	13	Besides that , they learn to ·waste their time [ be idle ] , going from house to house . And they not only ·waste their time [ are idlers ] but also begin to gossip and ·busy themselves with other people ’ s lives [ become busybodies/meddlers ] , saying things they should not say .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	14	So I want the younger widows to marry , have children , and manage their homes . Then ·no enemy will [ or the adversary will not ; C Satan ] have any ·reason [ or opportunity ] ·to criticize them [ or for maligning/slandering ( us/them ) ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	15	But some have already ·turned [ wandered ; strayed ] away to follow Satan .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family , she should ·care for [ provide support for ] them herself . The church should not ·have to care for them [ L carry this burden ] . Then it will be able to ·take care of [ support ] those who are truly widows .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	17	The elders who lead the church well should receive ·double honor [ or both honor and remuneration ; C probably includes both respect and financial support ; see v.
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	18	because the Scripture says : “ When an ox is ·working in the grain [ threshing ] , do not ·cover its mouth to keep it from eating [ muzzle it ; Deut . 25:4 ] , ” and “ A worker ·should be given his pay [ deserves his wages ; T is worthy of his hire ; Luke 10:7 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	19	Do not listen to someone who accuses an elder , without two or three witnesses [ Deut . 19:15 ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	20	·Reprimand [ Rebuke ] those who continue sinning . Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will ·have a warning [ L fear ; or show reverence ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	21	Before God and Christ Jesus and the ·chosen [ elect ] angels , I ·command [ solemnly charge ] you to ·do [ keep ; guard ] these things without ·taking sides [ prejudice ] or showing favoritism of any kind .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	22	·Think carefully before you [ L Do not quickly/hastily ] ·appoint someone to leadership [ L lay your hands on anyone ; 4:14 ; C a way of dedicating someone to Christian service ] , and don ’ t share in the sins of others . Keep yourself pure .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	23	Stop drinking only water , but drink a little wine to help your stomach and your frequent sicknesses .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	24	The sins of some people are ·easy to see [ obvious ; evident ] ·even before they are judged [ or arriving at the judgment before they do ; or preceding them into court ; L going before them to judgment ] , but the sins of others ·are seen only later [ arrive later ; L follow after ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	5	25	So also good deeds are ·easy to see [ obvious ; evident ] , but even those that are not easily seen can not stay hidden [ C since they will be revealed on judgment day ] .

EXB	1%20Timothy	6	6	[ L But ] ·Serving God [ Godliness ; Piety ] does ·make us very rich [ bring great profit ] , ·if we are satisfied with what we have [ when accompanied by contentment ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	2	The slaves whose masters are believers should not ·show their masters any less respect [ disrespect them ; or take advantage of them ] because they are believers . They should serve their masters even better , because they are helping believers ·they love [ or loved by God ; L who are beloved ] . You must teach and ·preach [ encourage/exhort them about ] these things . False Teaching and True Riches
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	3	Anyone who has a different teaching and does not agree with the ·true teaching [ sound/healthy words ] of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that ·shows the true way to serve God [ promotes piety/godliness ] —
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	4	that person is ·full of pride [ arrogant ; conceited ] and understands nothing , but ·is sick with a love for [ has an unhealthy interest in ] ·arguing [ controversies ; debate ] and ·fighting about [ quarrels over ] words . This brings ·jealousy [ envy ] , ·fighting [ strife ; division ] , ·speaking against others [ slander ; blasphemy ] , evil ·mistrust [ suspicions ] ,
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	5	and constant ·quarrels [ bickering ; disputes ] from those who have ·evil [ depraved ; corrupted ] minds and have ·lost [ been deprived of ] the truth . They think that ·serving God [ godliness ; piety ] is a way to ·get rich [ make a profit ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	7	[ L For ] We brought nothing into the world , so we can take nothing out .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	8	But , if we have food and clothes , we will be satisfied with that .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	9	Those who want to become rich ·bring temptation to themselves [ L fall into temptation ] and are caught in a trap . They ·want [ desire ] many foolish and harmful things that ·ruin and destroy people [ L plunge people into ruin and destruction ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	10	[ L For ] The love of money ·causes [ L is the root of ] all kinds of evil . Some people have ·left [ strayed/wandered from ] the faith , because they wanted ·to get more money [ L it ] , ·but they have caused themselves much sorrow [ L and have pierced themselves with many pains ] . Some Things to Remember
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	11	But you , man of God , ·run away from [ flee ] all those things . Instead , chase after [ pursue ] ·a right relationship with God [ righteousness ] , a godly life [ godliness ; piety ] , faith , love , ·patience [ perseverance ; endurance ] , and gentleness .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	12	·Fight the good fight [ or Run the good race ] of faith , grabbing hold of ·the life that continues forever [ eternal life ] . You were called to have that life when you confessed the good confession before many witnesses [ 1:18 ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	13	·In the sight of [ In the presence of ; L Before ] God , who gives life to everything , and of Christ Jesus , I ·give you a command [ exhort/encourage/charge you ] . Christ Jesus made the good confession when he stood before Pontius Pilate [ Matt . 27:11–26 ; Mark 15:1–15 ; Luke 23:1–24 ; John 18:28—19:16 ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	14	·Do what you were commanded to do [ Keep/Obey the command ] without ·wrong [ spot ; stain ] or blame until our Lord Jesus Christ ·comes again [ returns ; appears ] .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	15	God will ·make that happen [ L reveal it ] at ·the right [ the appointed ; his own ] time . He is the blessed and only ·Ruler [ Sovereign ] , the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	16	He is the only One who ·never dies [ has immortality ] . He lives in light ·so bright no one can go near it [ unapproachable ] . No one has ever seen God , or can see him . May honor and power belong to God forever . Amen .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	17	Command those who are rich ·with things of this world [ L in the present age ] not to be ·proud [ arrogant ; haughty ] . Tell them to hope in God , not in their uncertain riches . God richly gives us everything to enjoy .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	18	Tell ·the rich people [ L them ] to do good , to be rich in doing good deeds , to be generous and ready to share .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	19	By doing that , they will be ·saving [ storing up ] a treasure for themselves as a strong foundation for the future . Then they will be able to ·have [ take hold of ] the life that is true life .
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	20	Timothy , guard what God has ·trusted to [ entrusted/deposited with ] you . Stay away from foolish , ·useless [ irreverent ; godless ] talk and from the ·arguments [ absurdities ; contradictions ] of what is falsely called “ knowledge. ”
EXB	1%20Timothy	6	21	By ·saying they have that “ knowledge ” [ L claiming/professing it ] , some have ·missed [ strayed/lost their way from ] the true faith . Grace be with you .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy [ Acts 16:1–5 ;
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	1	Tim . 4:14 ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God as I always ·mention [ remember ] you in my prayers , day and night . I serve him , ·doing what I know is right [ with a clear conscience ] as my ancestors did .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	4	Remembering your tears [ C probably at Paul ’ s departure ] , I ·want very much [ long ] to see you so I can be filled with joy .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	5	I remember your ·true [ sincere ] faith . That faith first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice , and I ·know [ am sure/persuaded ] you now have that same faith .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	6	This is why I remind you to ·keep using [ rekindle ; fan into flames ] the gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you [ C a way of dedicating someone to Christian service ;
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	7	[ L For ] God did not give us ·a spirit [ or the Spirit ] that makes us ·afraid [ timid ] but ·a spirit [ or the Spirit ] of power and love and ·self-control [ self-discipline ; or good judgment ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	8	So do not be ashamed to ·tell people [ testify ; bear witness ] about our Lord , and do not be ashamed of me , ·in prison for the Lord [ L his prisoner ; C Paul was in prison in Rome for a second time and would soon be executed ] . But suffer with me for the ·Good News [ Gospel ] . God , who gives us the strength to do that ,
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	9	saved us and ·made us his holy people [ L called us to a holy calling ] . That was not because of anything we did ourselves but because of ·God ’ s [ L his own ] purpose and grace . That grace was given to us through Christ Jesus before ·time began [ L eternal times ] ,
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	10	but it is now ·shown [ revealed ; manifested ] to us by the ·coming [ appearing ; manifestation ] of our Savior Christ Jesus . He ·destroyed [ broke the power of ; abolished ] death , and through the ·Good News [ Gospel ] he ·showed us the way to have [ L illuminated ; brought to light ] ·life that can not be destroyed [ immortal life ; L life and immortality ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	11	I was ·chosen [ appointed ] ·to tell that Good News [ L a preacher/herald ] and to be an apostle and a teacher .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	12	I am suffering now ·because I tell the Good News [ L for this reason ] , but I am not ashamed , because I know the One in whom I have ·believed [ put my trust/faith ] . And I am ·sure [ convinced ; confident ] he is able to ·protect [ guard ; keep safe ] what ·he has trusted me with [ or I have entrusted with him ; L my deposit/entrustment ] until that day [ C the final day of judgment and reward ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	13	·Follow the pattern [ or Hold to the standard/norm ] of true teachings that you heard from me ·in [ or accompanied by the ] faith and love , which are ·available in [ L in ] Christ Jesus .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	14	·Protect [ Guard ] the ·truth that you were given [ L the good deposit entrusted to you ] ; ·protect [ guard ] it ·with the help of [ by the power of ; L through ; by ] the Holy Spirit who lives in us .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	15	You know that everyone in Asia [ C a Roman province in present-day western Turkey ] has left me , even Phygelus and Hermogenes .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	16	May the Lord show ·mercy [ kindness ] to the family of Onesiphorus [ 4:20 ; C the reference to the “ family ” rather than the man may indicate that Onesiphorus has since died ] , who has often ·helped [ encouraged ; refreshed ] me and was not ashamed ·that I was in prison [ L of my chains ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	17	When he came to Rome , he ·looked eagerly [ searched diligently ] for me until he found me .
EXB	2%20Timothy	1	18	May the Lord ·allow him to find [ grant/give him ] mercy from the Lord on that day [ C the final day of judgment and reward ] . You know very well how many ways he ·helped [ served ] me in Ephesus [ C a major port city in the Roman province of Asia , present-day western Turkey ; Acts

EXB	2%20Timothy	2	2	Sam . 7:12–16 ] . ·This is the Good News I preach [ L …according to my Gospel ] ,
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	3	·Share in the troubles we have [ or Join me in suffering ] like a good soldier of Christ Jesus .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	4	A soldier wants to please the ·enlisting [ or commanding ] officer , so no one serving in the army ·wastes time with [ gets involved/entangled with ] ·everyday matters [ civilian affairs ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	5	Also an athlete who takes part in a contest must ·obey all [ play by ] the rules in order to ·win [ L be crowned ; C with the victor ’ s wreath ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	6	The farmer who works hard should be the first person to get some of the food that was grown .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	7	Think about what I am saying , because the Lord will give you the ability to understand everything .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember Jesus Christ , who was raised from the dead , who is from the ·family [ L seed ] of David [
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	9	and I am suffering because of it to the point of being bound with chains like a criminal . But God ’ s ·teaching [ message ; word ] is not in chains .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	10	So I ·patiently accept [ endure ] all these troubles so that those whom God has chosen can ·have [ receive ; obtain ] the salvation that is in Christ Jesus . With that salvation comes ·glory that never ends [ eternal glory ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	11	This ·teaching is true [ saying/word is trustworthy ;
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	1	Tim . 1:20 ] and Philetus are like that [ C probably false teachers and opponents of Paul from Ephesus ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we ·accept suffering [ endure ; persevere ] , we will also ·rule [ reign ] with him . If we ·say we don ’ t know [ deny ; disown ; renounce ] him , he will ·say he doesn ’ t know [ deny ; disown ; renounce ] us .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we are not faithful , he will still be faithful , because he ·must be true to who he is [ L can not deny/disown himself ] . A Worker Pleasing to God
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	14	·Continue teaching [ L Remind them of ] these things , ·warning people [ L solemnly testifying/declaring ] in God ’ s presence not to ·argue [ quarrel ] about words . It ·does not help anyone [ is good for nothing ] , and it ruins those who listen .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	15	·Make every effort [ Do your best ; Be diligent ] to ·give [ present ] yourself to God as the kind of person he will approve . Be a worker who ·is not ashamed [ or will not be shamed ] and who ·uses the true teaching in the right way [ correctly handles the true message/word of truth ; or holds carefully to the true message/word of truth ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	16	Stay away from ·foolish , useless talk [ godless/irreverent chatter ;
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	17	Their evil teaching will spread like ·a sickness inside the body [ L gangrene ] . Hymenaeus [
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	18	They have ·left [ strayed away from ] the ·true teaching [ truth ] , saying that the ·rising from the dead [ resurrection ] has already taken place , and so they are ·destroying [ undermining ; overturning ] the faith of some people .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	19	But God ’ s strong foundation continues to stand , ·sealed [ inscribed ; engraved ] with these words : “ The Lord knows those who belong to him [ Num . 16:5 ] , ” and “ Everyone who ·wants to belong to [ L names the name of ] the Lord must ·stop doing wrong [ L turn away from wickedess/injustice ] . ”
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	20	In a ·large house [ wealthy household ] there are not only ·things [ vessels ; dishes ] made of gold and silver , but also ·things [ vessels ; dishes ] made of wood and clay . Some things are used for ·special [ honorable ; noble ] purposes , and others are made for ·ordinary [ dishonorable ; ignoble ] jobs [ C such as garbage or excrement ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	21	All who make themselves clean from ·evil [ L these things ; C the false teaching described in vv . 16–18 ] will be used for ·special [ honorable ; noble ] purposes . They will be made holy , useful to the Master , ready to do any good work .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	22	But ·run away from [ flee ] the ·evil desires [ passions ; desires ] of youth . ·Try hard to live right and to have [ L Pursue righteousness , ] faith , love , and peace , together with those who ·trust in [ L call upon ] the Lord from pure hearts .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	23	·Stay away from [ Avoid ; Having nothing to do with ] foolish and ·stupid [ ignorant ] ·arguments [ controversies ; speculation ] , because you know they ·grow into [ breed ; beget ] quarrels .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	24	And a ·servant [ slave ; bondservant ] of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone , a ·good [ qualified ; able ] teacher , and patient .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	25	·The Lord ’ s servant must gently teach [ L …gently instructing/correcting ] those who ·disagree [ are opponents ] . Then ·maybe [ perhaps ] God will ·let them change their minds [ L grant them repentance ] ·so they can accept [ L leading to knowledge of ] the truth .
EXB	2%20Timothy	2	26	And they may ·wake up [ come to their senses ] and escape from the ·trap [ snare ] of the devil , who catches them to do ·what he wants [ his will ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	2	because people will love themselves , love money , ·brag [ boast ] , and be ·proud [ arrogant ] . They will ·say evil things against others [ speak abusively ; or blaspheme ] and will not obey their parents or be ·thankful [ grateful ] or be ·the kind of people God wants [ holy ; pious ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	3	They will not love others , will refuse to ·forgive [ reconcile ] , will ·gossip [ slander ] , and will not control themselves . They will be ·cruel [ brutal ] , will ·hate [ L not love ] what is good ,
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	4	will ·turn against their friends [ be treacherous/traitors ] , and will ·do foolish things without thinking [ be reckless ] . They will be conceited , will love pleasure instead of God ,
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	5	·and will act as if they serve God [ L having a form/appearance of godliness/piety ] but will ·not have his [ or deny his/its ] power . ·Stay away from [ Avoid ] those people .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	6	[ L For ] Some of them ·go [ sneak ; worm their way ; talk their way ] into homes and ·get control of [ captivate ; gain influence over ] ·silly [ vulnerable ; or idle ] women who are ·full of [ or burdened with ( the guilt of ) ] sin and are ·led [ swayed ; controlled ] by ·many [ all kinds of ] evil desires .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	7	These women are always ·learning [ or seeking out ] new teachings , but they are never able to ·understand [ arrive at ] the truth fully .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	8	Just as Jannes and Jambres were against Moses [ C the traditional names ( not found in the OT ) of the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses ; Ex . 7:11 ] , these people are against the truth . Their ·thinking has been ruined [ minds/thoughts are corrupted/depraved ] , and they ·have failed in trying to follow the faith [ or are teaching a counterfeit faith ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they will not ·be successful in what they do [ or get much further ] , because as with Jannes and Jambres , everyone will see ·that they are foolish [ their folly/ignorance ] . Obey the Teachings
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	10	But you have followed what I teach , the way I live , my ·goal [ purpose/aim ( in life ) ] , faith , patience , and love . ·You know I never give up [ L …my endurance ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	11	·You know how I have been hurt and have suffered [ …my persecution and suffering ] , as in Antioch [ Acts 13:14–52 ] , Iconium [ Acts 14:1–5 ] , and Lystra [ Acts 14:6–20 ] . I have ·suffered [ L endured such persecutions ] , but the Lord ·saved [ rescued ; delivered ] me from all those troubles .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	12	[ L Indeed ; In fact ] Everyone who wants to live ·as God desires [ in a godly manner ] , in Christ Jesus , will be persecuted .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	13	But people who are evil and ·cheat others [ impostors ; charlatans ] will go from bad to worse . ·They will fool others , but they will also be fooling themselves [ L …deceiving and being deceived ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	14	But you should continue following the teachings you learned . You ·know [ are confident ] they are true , ·because you trust those who taught you [ L knowing from whom you learned them ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	15	Since you were a ·child [ infant ] you have known the ·Holy Scriptures [ or sacred writings ] which are able to make you wise . And that wisdom leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	16	All Scripture is ·inspired by God [ breathed out by God ; L God-breathed ] and is useful for teaching , for ·showing people what is wrong in their lives [ refuting error ; rebuking ] , for correcting faults , and for ·teaching how to live right [ training in righteousness ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	3	17	·Using the Scriptures , [ L …so that ] ·the person who serves God [ L God ’ s person ] will be ·capable [ competent ] , ·having all that is needed [ fully equipped ] to do every good work .

EXB	2%20Timothy	4	4	They will ·stop listening to [ L turn their ears/hearing away from ] the truth and will ·begin to follow [ wander/turn aside to ] ·false stories [ myths ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	4	3	because the time will come when people will not ·listen to [ put up with ; endure ] the ·true [ sound ; healthy ] teaching but will ·find many more [ gather around themselves ; accumulate ] teachers who ·please them [ meet their needs/desires ] by saying the things ·they want to hear [ their ears itch for ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	4	5	But you should ·control yourself [ be sober-minded ] at all times , ·accept troubles [ endure hardships ] , do the work of ·telling the Good News [ L an evangelist ] , and ·complete all the duties of a servant of God [ L fulfill your service/ministry ] .
EXB	2%20Timothy	4	6	[ L For ] My life is being ·given as an offering to God [ L poured out as a drink offering ; Num . 28:24 ; Phil . 2:17 ] , and the time has come for ·me to leave this life [ L my departure ] .

EXB	Titus	1	13	·The words that prophet said are [ L This testimony is ] true . So ·firmly [ severely ; sharply ] ·tell those people they are wrong [ rebuke/admonish them ] so they may become ·strong [ sound ; healthy ] in the faith ,
EXB	Titus	1	14	not ·accepting [ paying attention to ; wasting time with ] Jewish ·false stories [ myths ;
EXB	Titus	1	15	To those who are pure , all things are pure , but to those who are ·full of sin [ defiled ; polluted ( with sin ) ] and ·do not believe [ unfaithful ] , nothing is pure . Both their minds and their consciences have been ·ruined [ defiled ; polluted ] .
EXB	Titus	1	16	They ·say [ claim ; confess ] they know God , but their actions show they ·do not accept [ deny ] him . They are ·hateful people [ detestable ; abominable ] , they refuse to obey , and they are ·useless [ unfit ; disqualified ] for doing anything good .
EXB	Titus	2	2	Teach older men to be ·self-controlled [ sober ] , ·serious [ dignified ; worthy of respect ] , ·wise [ self-controlled ] , ·strong [ sound ; healthy ] in faith , in love , and in ·patience [ endurance ] .
EXB	Titus	2	3	In the same way , teach older women to be ·holy [ reverent ] in their behavior , not ·speaking against [ slandering ; gossiping about ] others or enslaved to ·too much wine [ excessive drinking ] , but teaching what is good .
EXB	Titus	2	4	Then they can ·teach [ train ] the young women to love their husbands , to love their children ,
EXB	Titus	2	5	to be ·wise [ sensible ; self-controlled ] and pure , to be ·good workers at home [ devoted to home life ] , to be kind , and to ·yield [ submit ] to their husbands . Then no one will be able to ·criticize [ discredit ; malign ; blaspheme ] the ·teaching God gave us [ word of God ] .
EXB	Titus	2	6	In the same way , encourage young men to be ·wise [ self-controlled ] .
EXB	Titus	2	7	In every way be an example of doing good deeds . When you teach , do it with ·honesty [ integrity ] and ·seriousness [ dignity ] .
EXB	Titus	2	8	Speak ·the truth [ a sound message ] so that you can not be ·criticized [ condemned ] . Then those who are against you will be ashamed because there is nothing bad to say about us .
EXB	Titus	2	9	·Slaves [ Bondservants ] should ·yield [ submit ] to their own masters at all times , trying to please them and not ·arguing with [ talking back to ] them .
EXB	Titus	2	10	They should not ·steal [ pilfer ] from them but should show their masters ·they can be fully trusted [ or that their faith is good/productive ; L all good faith ] so that in everything they do they will ·make attractive [ adorn ; show the beauty of ] the teaching of God our Savior .
EXB	Titus	2	11	·That is the way we should live , because [ L For ] God ’ s grace that can save everyone has ·come [ appeared ; been revealed ] .
EXB	Titus	2	12	It ·teaches [ trains ; disciplines ] us to ·turn away from [ reject ; deny ] ungodly living and ·the evil things the world wants to do [ or worldly desires ; sinful pleasures ] . Instead , that grace teaches us to live in the present age in a ·wise [ self-controlled ] and ·right [ upright ; just ] way and in a ·way that shows we serve God [ godly manner ] .
EXB	Titus	2	13	We should live like that while we wait for our ·great [ happy ; blessed ] hope and the ·coming of the glory [ glorious appearing/manifestation ] of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ .
EXB	Titus	2	14	He gave himself for us so he might ·pay the price to free [ redeem ; ransom ] us from all ·evil [ wickedness ; lawlessness ] and to make us pure people who belong only to him—people who are always ·wanting [ eager ; zealous ] to do good deeds .
EXB	Titus	2	15	Say these things and ·encourage [ exhort ] the people and ·tell them what is wrong in their lives [ rebuke/admonish them ] , with all authority . Do not let anyone ·treat you as if you were unimportant [ look down on/despise/disregard you ] .
EXB	Titus	3	3	In the past we also were foolish . We did not obey , we were ·wrong [ mislead ; deceived ] , and we were slaves to ·many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed [ L various passions and pleasures ] . We spent our lives doing evil and being ·jealous [ envious ] . People hated us , and we hated each other .
EXB	Titus	3	2	Tim . 4:12 ] to you , make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis [ C a city located on the west coast of Greece ] , because I have decided to stay there this winter .
EXB	Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and ·love [ love of humanity ] of God our Savior ·was shown [ appeared ; was revealed ] ,
EXB	Titus	3	5	he saved us because of his mercy . It was not because of ·good deeds we did to be right with him [ or righteous deeds we did ] . He saved us through the washing ·that made us new people [ L of new-birth/regeneration and renewal ] ·through [ by ] the Holy Spirit .
EXB	Titus	3	6	God poured out ·richly [ generously ; abundantly ] upon us that Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Savior .
EXB	Titus	3	7	Being [ L …so that having been ] ·made right with God [ justified ; declared righteous ] by his grace , we could ·have the hope of receiving [ L become heirs with the hope/expectation of ] ·the life that never ends [ eternal life ] .
EXB	Titus	3	8	This ·teaching is true [ saying/word is trustworthy ;
EXB	Titus	3	1	Cor . 1:12 ; 3:4–6 ] on their journey so that they have everything they need .
EXB	Titus	3	9	But ·stay away from [ avoid ] foolish ·arguments [ controversies ; debates ] and ·talk about useless family histories [ L genealogies ;
EXB	Titus	3	14	Our people must learn to ·use their lives for [ devote themselves to ; or take the lead in ] doing good deeds to ·provide what is necessary [ meet urgent needs ] so that their lives will not be ·useless [ unfruitful ] .
EXB	Titus	3	10	After a first and second warning , ·avoid [ reject ; have nothing to do with ] someone who ·causes arguments [ is divisive ; causes factions ] .
EXB	Titus	3	11	You can know that such people are ·evil [ warped ; perverted ; corrupt ] and sinful ; ·their own sins prove them wrong [ L …being self-condemned ] . Some Things to Remember
EXB	Titus	3	12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus [ Acts 20:4 ; Eph . 6:21 ; Col. 4:7 ;
EXB	Titus	3	13	·Do all you can [ Make every effort ] to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos [ Acts 18:24 ,
EXB	Titus	3	27	;
EXB	Titus	3	15	All who are with me greet you . Greet those who love us in the faith . Grace be with you all .
EXB	Philemon	1	1	Cor . 16:10–11 ; Phil . 2:19–24 ] , our brother . To Philemon , our ·dear friend [ brother ] and ·worker with us [ coworker ] ;
EXB	Philemon	1	2	Tim . 4:11 ] , ·workers together with me [ my coworkers ] , send greetings .
EXB	Philemon	1	3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Philemon ’ s Love and Faith
EXB	Philemon	1	4	I always thank my God when I ·mention [ remember ] you in my prayers ,
EXB	Philemon	1	5	because I hear about the love you have for all ·God ’ s holy people [ T the saints ] and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus .
EXB	Philemon	1	6	I pray that the ·faith you share [ the sharing/fellowship of your faith ] may ·make you [ enable/empower you to ] understand every blessing we have in Christ .
EXB	Philemon	1	7	I have great joy and comfort , my brother , because the love you have shown to ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] has refreshed ·them [ their hearts ; L their inward parts ; C the seat of emotions ] . Accept Onesimus as a Brother
EXB	Philemon	1	8	So , in Christ , I could be bold and order you to do what is ·right [ required ; proper ; your duty ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	9	But because I love you , I am ·pleading with [ appealing to ; urging ; encouraging ] you instead . I , Paul , an old man now and also a prisoner [ C in Rome , about ad
EXB	Philemon	1	60	; Acts 28:16–31 ; Phil . 1:7 ] for Christ Jesus ,
EXB	Philemon	1	10	am ·pleading with [ appealing to ; urging ; encouraging ] you for my child Onesimus , ·who became my child [ L whom I begat/fathered ; C Paul evidently led Onesimus to Christ in Rome ] while I was in prison .
EXB	Philemon	1	11	In the past he was ·useless [ unprofitable ; worthless ] to you , but now he has become ·useful [ helpful ; valuable ] for both you and me [ C a play on words , since Onesimus means “ useful ” or “ helpful ” ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	12	I am sending him back to you , and ·with him I am sending my own heart [ or he is my very heart ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	13	I wanted to keep him with me so that ·in your place [ or on your behalf ] he might ·help [ serve ] me while I am in prison for the ·Good News [ Gospel ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	14	But I did not want to do anything without ·asking you first [ your consent ] so that any good you do for me will be because you want to do it , not ·because I forced you [ out of compulsion ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	15	[ L For ] Maybe Onesimus was separated from you for a short time so you could have him back forever—
EXB	Philemon	1	16	no longer as a slave , but better than a slave , as a loved brother . ·I love him very much , but you will love him even more [ L …especially to me , but more so to you ] , both ·as a person [ or in the natural realm ; L in the flesh ] and ·as a believer in the Lord [ or in the spiritual realm ; L in the Lord ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	17	So if you consider me your partner , ·welcome [ receive ; accept ] Onesimus as you would ·welcome [ receive ; accept ] me .
EXB	Philemon	1	18	If he has ·done anything wrong to [ defrauded ; harmed ] you or if he owes you anything , charge that to me .
EXB	Philemon	1	19	I , Paul , am writing this with my own hand [ C contrary to his usual practice of using a scribe , or amanuensis ; Rom . 16:22 ] . I will pay it back , and I will ·say nothing about what [ make no mention that ] you owe me for your ·own life [ very self ; C Paul had evidently led Philemon to Christ ] .
EXB	Philemon	1	20	·So [ L Yes ] , my brother , I ask ·that you do this for me [ for this benefit/favor from you ] in the Lord : Refresh my heart in Christ .
EXB	Philemon	1	21	I write this letter , ·knowing [ L confident of your obedience/compliance , knowing ] that you will do what I ask you and even more .
EXB	Philemon	1	22	One more thing—prepare a ·room [ guest room ] for me in which to stay , because I hope God will answer your prayers and I will be ·able to come [ restored ; L granted ] to you . Final Greetings
EXB	Philemon	1	23	Epaphras [ Col. 1:7 ; 4:12 ] , a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus , sends greetings to you .
EXB	Philemon	1	24	And also Mark [ Acts 12:25 ; 13:13 ; 15:37–39 ; Col. 4:10 ] , Aristarchus [ Acts 19:29 ; Col. 4:10 ] , Demas [ Col. 4:14 ;
EXB	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit .
EXB	Hebrews	1	1	·In the past [ Long ago ] God spoke to our ·ancestors [ forefathers ; fathers ] through the prophets ·many times [ or in a fragmentary/partial way ; L in many parts ] and in many different ways .
EXB	Hebrews	1	2	Sam . 7:14 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	1	3	] until I put your enemies ·under your control [ L as a footstool under your feet ; Ps . 110:1 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	1	4	The Son became much ·greater [ superior ; better ] than the angels , ·and [ or just as ; in the same way that ] ·God gave him [ L he inherited ] a name [ C either “ Son ” ( v.
EXB	Hebrews	1	5	This is because God never said to any of the angels , “ You are my Son . Today I have ·become your Father [ T begotten you ; Ps . 2:7 ; see Heb . 5:5 ; Acts 13:33 ] . ” ·Nor did God say of any angel [ L And again ] , “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son [
EXB	Hebrews	1	6	And [ L again ] when God brings ·his firstborn Son [ L the firstborn ; Rom . 8:29 ] into the world , he says , “ Let all God ’ s angels worship him [ Ps . 97:7 ( in the Greek version of the OT ) ; C similar words are found in the Greek version of Deut . 32:43 and in a Hebrew copy among the Dead Sea Scrolls ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	1	7	This is what God said about the angels : “ ·God makes his angels become like winds [ or God makes winds into his messengers ] . He makes ·his servants become like flames of fire [ or flames of fire to be his servants ; Ps . 104:4 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	1	8	But God said this about his Son : “ ·God , your throne [ L Your throne , O God ; ] will last forever and ever . You will rule your kingdom with ·fairness [ L a just/righteous scepter ; C a scepter symbolizes royal authority ] .
EXB	Hebrews	1	9	You love ·right [ righteousness ] and hate ·evil [ wickedness ; lawlessness ] , so ·God [ L God , your God , ] has ·chosen [ L anointed ] you ·from among your friends [ or above your peers ; above anyone else ] ; he has ·set you apart with much joy [ L anointed you with the oil of joy/rejoicing ; Ps . 45:6–7 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	1	10	God also says , “ Lord , in the beginning you ·made [ L laid the foundations of ] the earth , and your hands made the ·skies [ heavens ] .
EXB	Hebrews	1	11	They will be destroyed , but you ·will remain [ continue ; C forever ] . They will all wear out like ·clothes [ a garment ] .
EXB	Hebrews	1	12	You will ·fold them [ roll them up ] like a ·coat [ robe ] . And , like ·clothes [ a garment ] , you will change them . But you ·never change [ are the same ; 13:8 ] , and your ·life [ L years ] will never ·end [ fail ; run out ; Ps . 102:25–27 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	1	13	And God never said this to an angel : “ Sit by me at my right ·side [ hand ; v.
EXB	Hebrews	1	14	·All the angels are [ L Are they not… ? ] ·spirits who serve God [ or ministering spirits ] and are sent to ·help [ serve ] those who will ·receive [ L inherit ] salvation .
EXB	Hebrews	2	2	·The teaching [ L If/Since the message/word… ] God spoke through angels [ Acts 7:53 ] was shown to be ·true [ firm ; reliable ] , and ·anyone who did not follow it or obey it [ every violation/transgression and disobedience ] received the punishment that ·was earned [ it deserved ; was just ] .
EXB	Hebrews	2	3	·So surely we also will be punished [ L How will we escape… ? ] if we ignore ·this [ such a ] great salvation . The Lord himself first ·told about [ announced ] this salvation , and those who heard him ·testified [ confirmed to us ] it was true .
EXB	Hebrews	2	4	God also ·testified to the truth of the message [ joined in/confirmed their testimony ] by using great signs , wonders , many kinds of ·miracles [ acts of power ] , and by ·giving people [ L the distribution/apportioning of ] gifts through the Holy Spirit , ·just as he wanted [ or however he desired ] . Christ Became like Us
EXB	Hebrews	2	5	[ L For ] God did not ·choose angels to be the rulers of the new world that was coming [ L subject the world to come to angels ] , which is what we have been talking about .
EXB	Hebrews	2	6	·It is written in the Scriptures [ L Someone has testified somewhere ] , “ ·Why are people even important to you [ L What is man/humanity that you remember/think about him/them ] ? ·Why do you take care of human beings [ L Or the son of man/children of Adam that you care for/about them ] ?
EXB	Hebrews	2	7	You made ·them [ or him ] ·a little [ or for a little while ] lower than the angels and crowned ·them [ or him ] with glory and honor . [ a ]
EXB	Hebrews	2	8	( cited above ) . ]
EXB	Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus , who for a short time was made lower than the angels . This was so that , by God ’ s grace , he could ·die [ L taste death ] for everyone . And now , because he suffered and died , he is ·wearing a crown of [ L crowned with ] glory and honor . [ C Jesus fulfills humanity ’ s destiny : to be crowned with glory and honor ; Ps .
EXB	Hebrews	2	10	God is the One ·who made all things , and all things are for his glory [ L through whom and for whom all things exist ] . He wanted to ·have many children share his [ lead/bring many children/sons to ] glory , so [ L it was fitting/appropriate that ] he made the ·One who leads people to [ Leader/Pioneer/Source of their ] salvation perfect through suffering .
EXB	Hebrews	2	11	[ L For indeed ] ·Jesus , [ L the one ] who makes people holy , and those who are made holy ·are from the same family [ or have the same Father ; or have one origin ; L are all from one ] . ·So [ For this reason ] he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters .
EXB	Hebrews	2	12	He says , “ Then , I will ·tell my brothers and sisters about you [ L proclaim your name to my brothers ( and sisters ) ] ; I will ·praise [ sing hymns/praise songs to ] you in the ·public meeting [ midst of the assembly ; Ps . 22:22 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	2	13	He also says , “ I will ·trust [ put my confidence ] in ·God [ L him ; Is . 8:17 ] . ” And he also says , “ I am here , and with me are the children God has given me [ Is . 8:18 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	2	14	[ L Therefore ] Since these children ·are people with physical bodies [ have in common their flesh and blood ] , Jesus himself ·became like them [ shared their humanity ; L likewise shared the same things ] . He did this so that , by dying , he could destroy the one who has the power of death—the devil—
EXB	Hebrews	2	15	and free those who were ·like slaves [ held in slavery ] all their lives because of their fear of death .
EXB	Hebrews	2	16	[ L For ] Clearly , it is not angels that Jesus helps , but the ·people who are from [ seed/descendants of ] Abraham [ C the father of the Jewish nation ; Gen. 12—25 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	2	17	For this reason Jesus had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way so he could ·be their [ L become a ] merciful and faithful high priest in ·service [ L the things pertaining ] to God . Then Jesus could ·die in their place to take away [ make atonement for ; be the sacrifice that pays for ; be the sacrifice that appeases God ’ s wrath against ] ·their sins [ L the sins of the people ] .
EXB	Hebrews	2	18	And now he can help those who are ·tempted [ or tested ] , because he himself suffered and ·was tempted [ or was tested ; or passed the test ] . Footnotes - Hebrews 2:7 You … honor . Some Greek copies continue , “ You put them in charge of everything you made. ” See Psalm 8:6 .
EXB	Hebrews	3	3	Jesus ·has [ deserves ; is worthy of ] more honor than Moses , just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself .
EXB	Hebrews	3	2	Jesus was faithful to God who appointed him just as Moses was faithful in God ’ s ·family [ household ; house ] .
EXB	Hebrews	3	4	[ L For ] Every house is built by someone , but the builder of everything is God himself .
EXB	Hebrews	3	5	Moses was faithful in ·God ’ s family [ L all of God ’ s house ; Num . 12:7 ] as a servant , and he ·told [ testified to ] what God would say in the future .
EXB	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ is faithful as a Son over God ’ s house . And we are God ’ s house if we ·confidently maintain our hope [ or maintain our courage and confident hope ] . We Must Continue to Follow God
EXB	Hebrews	3	7	] . ·Help [ Encourage ] each other so none of you will become hardened ·because sin has tricked you [ by sin ’ s deception ] .
EXB	Hebrews	3	8	Do not ·be stubborn [ L harden your hearts ] as in the past ·when you turned against God [ L as in the rebellion ; Ex . 17:1–7 ] , when you tested God in the desert .
EXB	Hebrews	3	9	There your ancestors tried me and tested me and saw the things I did for forty years .
EXB	Hebrews	3	10	I was angry with ·them [ L that generation ] . I said , ‘ ·They are not loyal to me [ L Their hearts are always wandering ] and have not ·understood my ways [ or discerned/obeyed my will ] . ’
EXB	Hebrews	3	11	] ? He was talking to those who did not ·obey [ or believe ] him .
EXB	Hebrews	3	12	So brothers and sisters , ·be careful [ see to it ] that none of you has an evil , unbelieving heart that will ·turn you away from [ desert ; forsake ] the living God .
EXB	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage each other every day while it is “ today ” [ C meaning the time of opportunity to be saved ; v.
EXB	Hebrews	3	14	[ L For ] We all ·share in [ or have become partners with ] Christ if [ indeed ; in fact ] we ·keep [ hold firm ] till the end the sure ·faith [ conviction ; confidence ] we had in the beginning .
EXB	Hebrews	3	15	This is what the Scripture says : “ Today ·listen to what he says [ L if you hear his voice… ] . Do not ·be stubborn [ L harden your hearts ] as in the past ·when you turned against God [ L as in the rebellion ; Ps . 95:7–8 ; C referring to Ex . 17:1–7 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	3	16	Who heard God ’ s voice and ·was against [ rebelled against ; provoked ] him ? ·It was [ L Was it not… ? ] all those people Moses led out of Egypt .
EXB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was God angry for forty years ? ·He was angry [ L Was it not… ? ] with those who sinned , ·who died [ L whose corpses/bodies fell ] in the desert [ Num . 14:29 ,
EXB	Hebrews	3	32	] .
EXB	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom ·was God talking when he promised [ L did he swear ] that they would never enter his rest [ v.
EXB	Hebrews	3	19	So we see they were not allowed to enter [ C the Promised Land and God ’ s promised rest ] because ·they did not believe [ of unbelief/faithlessness ] .
EXB	Hebrews	4	4	·In the Scriptures [ L For somewhere ] he talked about the seventh day of the week : “ And on the seventh day God rested from all his works [ Gen. 2:2 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	4	2	[ L For ] The ·Good News [ Gospel ] was preached to us just as it was to them . But the ·teaching [ message ; word ] they heard did not help them , because they heard it but did not ·accept [ combine ; join ] it with faith . [ a ]
EXB	Hebrews	4	3	[ L For ; Now ] We who have believed are able to enter ·and have God ’ s rest [ L the rest ] . As God has said , “ I was angry and ·made a promise [ declared/swore an oath ] , ‘ They will never enter my rest [ Ps . 95:11 ] . ’ ” But God ’ s work was finished from the ·time he made [ foundation/creation of ] the world .
EXB	Hebrews	4	5	And again in ·the Scripture [ or this passage ; C Psalm
EXB	Hebrews	4	95	, the passage the author has been discussing ] God said , “ They will never enter my rest [ Ps . 95:11 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	4	6	·It is still true that some people will [ or This passage shows that some can still ] enter God ’ s rest , but those who ·first [ or formerly ] ·heard the way to be saved [ L had the Good News/Gospel proclaimed to them ] did not enter , because they did not ·obey [ believe ; remain faithful ] .
EXB	Hebrews	4	7	So God ·planned [ set ; established ; ordained ] another day , called “ today ” [ 3:13 ] . He spoke about that day through David a long time later in the ·same Scripture used before [ words quoted before ] : “ Today ·listen to what he says [ L if you hear his voice… ] . Do not ·be stubborn [ L harden your hearts ; Ps . 95:7–8 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	4	8	[ L For ; Now ] If Joshua [ C Moses ’ successor , who led God ’ s people into the Promised Land ; Josh . 3—4 ] had ·led the people into that [ L given them ] rest , God would not have spoken later about another day .
EXB	Hebrews	4	9	This shows that the ·rest [ L Sabbath rest ; C sharing in the rest God enjoyed after Creation ] for God ’ s people ·is still coming [ or is still available ; L remains ] .
EXB	Hebrews	4	10	[ L For ] Anyone who enters God ’ s rest ·will rest [ or has also rested ] from his work as God did .
EXB	Hebrews	4	11	Let us ·try as hard as we can [ strive ; make every effort ] to enter ·God ’ s [ L that ] rest so that no one will ·fail [ be lost ; L fall ] by following the example of those who ·refused to obey [ or did not believe ; were unfaithful ] .
EXB	Hebrews	4	12	[ L For ] God ’ s word is alive and ·working [ active ; powerful ; effective ] and is sharper than a double-edged sword . It ·cuts all the way into us , where the soul and the spirit are joined , to the center of our joints and bones [ L penetrates until it divides even soul and spirit , joints and marrow ] . And it ·judges [ discerns ] the ·thoughts [ ideas ] and ·feelings [ attitudes ; intentions ] in our hearts .
EXB	Hebrews	4	13	·Nothing in all the world [ Nothing in all creation ; or No creature ] can be hidden from God . Everything is ·clear [ naked ] and ·lies open before him [ L exposed to his eyes ] , and to him we must ·explain the way we have lived [ give an account ; answer ] . Jesus Is Our High Priest
EXB	Hebrews	4	14	[ L Therefore ] Since we have a great high priest [ 2:17–18 ] , Jesus the Son of God , who has ·gone into [ ascended to ; or passed through ] ·heaven [ or the heavens ] , let us hold ·on [ firmly ] to ·the faith we have [ L the confession/profession ; C of our faith ] .
EXB	Hebrews	4	15	·For our high priest is able [ L For we do not have a high priest who is unable ] to ·understand [ sympathize with ] our weaknesses . He was tempted in every way that we are , but he did not sin .
EXB	Hebrews	4	16	Let us , then , ·feel very sure that we can come before [ L confidently approach ] God ’ s throne ·where there is grace [ L of grace ; C as opposed to a throne of judgment and condemnation ] . There we can receive mercy and ·grace [ L find grace ] to help us ·when we need it [ L at the right time ] . Footnotes - Hebrews 4:2 because … faith Some Greek copies read “ because they did not share the faith of those who heard it . ”
EXB	Hebrews	5	5	So also ·Christ [ or the Messiah ; C either a proper name or a title ] did not ·choose himself to have the honor of being [ L glorify/exalt himself by becoming ] a high priest , but God ·chose [ glorified ; exalted ] him . God said to him , “ You are my Son . Today I have ·become your Father [ T begotten you ; Ps . 2:7 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	5	2	Since he himself is weak [ C subject to human frailty , both physical and moral ] , he is able to be gentle with those who ·do not understand [ are ignorant ] and who are ·doing wrong things [ easily deceived ; wayward ; going astray ] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	3	Because he is weak , the high priest must offer sacrifices for his own sins and also for the sins of the people [ Lev .
EXB	Hebrews	5	16	] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	4	To be a high priest is an honor , but no one ·chooses himself for this work [ takes this office by his own authority ; L takes this honor for himself ] . He must be ·called [ chosen ] by God as Aaron was [ C Moses ’ brother and Israel ’ s first high priest ; Ex . 28:1 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	6	; Ps . 110:4 ] . Warning Against Falling Away
EXB	Hebrews	5	7	·While Jesus lived on earth [ L In the days of his flesh/earthly life ] , he ·prayed to God and asked God for help [ L offered prayers and petitions ] . He prayed with loud cries and tears to the One who could save him from death , and his prayer was heard because ·he trusted God [ L of his reverence/devotion ; C referring especially to Jesus ’ prayer in Gethsemane ; Matt . 26:39 ; Mark 14:36 ; Luke 22:41 ,
EXB	Hebrews	5	44	] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	8	Even though Jesus was ·the Son of God [ or a son ; C with all the rights and privileges of an heir ] , he learned obedience by what he suffered [ C through total obedience to God , Jesus achieved the glorified or perfected state God originally intended for human beings ; 2:3–9 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	9	And ·because his obedience was perfect [ or having achieved perfection ] , he ·was able to give [ L became the source/means of ] eternal salvation to all who obey him .
EXB	Hebrews	5	10	In this way God ·made [ designated ; appointed ] Jesus a high priest , ·a priest like [ L in the priestly order/line of ] Melchizedek [ v.
EXB	Hebrews	5	11	We have much to say about this , but it is hard to explain because you are so ·slow to understand [ hard of hearing ; C spiritually ] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	12	By now you should be teachers , but you need someone to teach you again the ·first lessons [ elementary truths ; basic principles ] of God ’ s ·message [ revelation ; oracles ] . You still need ·the teaching that is like milk [ L milk ] . You are not ready for solid food .
EXB	Hebrews	5	13	[ L For ] Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and ·knows nothing about [ or is unskilled/inexperienced with ] ·right teaching [ or the message about righteousness ] .
EXB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for those who are ·grown up [ mature ] . ·They are mature enough [ …who through practice/exercise have trained their faculties/senses ] to know the difference between good and evil .
EXB	Hebrews	6	6	If they have ·fallen away [ committed apostasy ] , it is impossible to ·bring them back to a changed life again [ L renew them again to repentance ] , because they are nailing the Son of God to a cross again and are ·shaming him in front of others [ making a public disgrace/exhibition of him ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	2	We should not return to the teaching about baptisms [ C either Christian baptism or Jewish ceremonial washings ] , about laying on of hands [ C a ritual of blessing and/or conferring of authority ] , about the raising of the dead and eternal judgment [ C these may be Jewish practices or foundational Christian teaching ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	3	And we will ·go on to grown-up teaching [ L do this ] if God allows .
EXB	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible to ·bring back again to a changed life [ L renew again to repentance ] those who were once ·in God ’ s light [ enlightened ] , and ·enjoyed [ experienced ; L tasted ] ·heaven ’ s gift [ or the heavenly gift ; C perhaps the gift of salvation ] , and ·shared in [ partook of ] the Holy Spirit .
EXB	Hebrews	6	5	They ·found out [ L tasted ] how good God ’ s word is , and ·they received [ L tasted ] the ·powers [ miracles ] of ·his new world [ the coming age/world ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	7	·Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain and [ L Land that drinks in the abundance of rain ] produces a ·good [ useful ] crop for those who ·work [ farm ] it . That land receives God ’ s blessings .
EXB	Hebrews	6	8	·Other people are like land that [ L But if it… ] grows thorns and ·weeds [ thistles ] and is worthless . It is about to be cursed by God and ·will be destroyed by fire [ L its end/fate is burning ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	9	·Dear friends [ Loved ones ; T Beloved ] , we are saying this to you , but we ·really expect [ are convinced/confident of ] better things from you that ·will lead to [ or accompany ; come with ] your salvation .
EXB	Hebrews	6	10	; 7:1–17 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	11	] . Be ·like [ L imitators of ] those who through faith and ·patience [ endurance ] will ·receive [ inherit ] what God has promised .
EXB	Hebrews	6	12	We do not want you to become ·lazy [ sluggish ; C in contrast to diligent ; v.
EXB	Hebrews	6	13	[ L For ] God made a promise to Abraham . And as there is no one greater than God , he ·used himself [ vowed by his own name ; L swore by himself ] when he swore to Abraham ,
EXB	Hebrews	6	14	saying , “ I will ·surely [ or greatly ] bless you and ·give you many [ greatly multiply your ] descendants [ Gen. 22:17 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	6	15	Abraham ·waited patiently for this to happen [ persevered ] , and he received what God promised .
EXB	Hebrews	6	16	[ L For ] People always ·use the name of [ L swear by ] someone greater than themselves when they swear . The oath ·proves [ is confirmation ] that what they say is true , and this ·ends all arguing [ or settles the dispute ; C an oath by a higher authority is taken as a legal guarantee ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	17	God wanted to ·make very clear [ demonstrate convincingly ] to ·those who would get what he promised [ L the heirs of the promise ] that his ·purposes [ or plans ] never change , so he ·made [ L confirmed/guaranteed it with ] an oath .
EXB	Hebrews	6	18	These two things can not change : God can not lie when he makes a promise , and he can not lie when he makes an oath . These things greatly encourage us , who ·came [ L have fled ] to God for safety , to hold on to the hope ·we have been given [ L set before us ] .
EXB	Hebrews	6	19	We have this hope as an anchor for ·the soul [ our lives ] , ·sure [ stable ; secure ] and ·strong [ reliable ; unshifting ] . It enters behind the curtain in the ·Most Holy Place in heaven [ L inner place/sanctuary ] ,
EXB	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus has gone ·ahead of us [ L as a forerunner ] ·and for us [ on our behalf ] . He has become the high priest forever , a priest like Melchizedek [ Ps . 110:4 ; Heb . 5:6 ,
EXB	Hebrews	7	7	Now ·everyone knows [ it is indisputable ] that the ·more important person blesses the less important person [ L lesser/inferior is blessed by the greater/superior ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	10	] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	7	2	and Abraham ·gave [ L apportioned/divided to ] him a ·tenth [ tithe ] ·of everything he had brought back from the battle [ L of everything ] . First , Melchizedek ’ s name means “ king of ·goodness [ righteousness ; justice ] , ” and he is king of Salem [ C another name for Jerusalem ] , which means “ king of peace. ”
EXB	Hebrews	7	3	; C he was not from the Levitical line of priests ] , but he collected a ·tenth [ tithe ] from Abraham . And he blessed Abraham , the man who had God ’ s promises [ Gen. 12:1–3 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	4	You can see how great Melchizedek was . Abraham , the ·great father [ patriarch ] , gave him a tenth of ·everything that he won in battle [ the spoils/booty/plunder ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	5	Now the law ·says [ authorizes ; commands ] that those ·in the tribe [ L of the sons/descendants ] of Levi who become priests must collect a ·tenth [ tithe ] from the people—their ·own people [ L brothers ( and sisters ) ] —even though ·the priests and the people [ L they ] ·are from the family [ are also descendants ; L have come from the loins/body ] of Abraham .
EXB	Hebrews	7	6	[ L But ] Melchizedek was not ·from the tribe of Levi [ L descended from them ; v.
EXB	Hebrews	7	8	·Priests receive a tenth , even though they are only men who live and then die [ L In the one case , mortal men receive a tithe , … ] . ·But Melchizedek , who received a tenth from Abraham , continues living , as the Scripture says [ L …but in the other case , the one ( receives the tithe ) who is declared ( by Scripture ) to be alive ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	9	We might even say that Levi , who receives a ·tenth [ tithe ] , also paid it when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth .
EXB	Hebrews	7	11	·The people were given the law concerning the system of priests from the tribe of Levi , but they could not be made perfect through that system [ L If perfection could be attained through the Levitical priesthood , established for the people in the law… ] . ·So there was [ L …why was there… ? ] a need for another priest to come , a priest ·like [ L in the priestly order/line of ] Melchizedek , not [ L in the priestly order/line of ] Aaron [ C Moses ’ brother and Israel ’ s first high priest ( 5:4 ; Ex . 28:1 ) ; the existence of Melchizedek ’ s priestly line implies that the priesthood through Levi and Aaron was inadequate ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	12	And when a different ·kind of priest [ priesthood ; priestly line ] comes , the law must be changed , too .
EXB	Hebrews	7	13	·We are saying these things about Christ , who [ L For the one about whom these things are said ] belonged to a different tribe [ C Jesus belonged to the tribe of Judah , not Levi ] . No one from that tribe [ C Judah ] ever served as a priest at the altar .
EXB	Hebrews	7	14	It is clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah , and Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe [ C the kings from David ’ s line ( including Jesus ) came from the tribe of Judah , but the OT priesthood came through Levi and Aaron ] . Jesus Is like Melchizedek
EXB	Hebrews	7	15	And this becomes even more clear ·when we see that [ L if ] another priest ·comes [ arises ; appears on the scene ] who is like Melchizedek [ vv . 1–14 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	16	He was not made a priest by ·human rules and laws [ or regulations about physical descent/ancestry ] but through the power of his life , which ·continues forever [ or is indestructable ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	17	; Ps . 110:4 ] . ’ ”
EXB	Hebrews	7	18	The ·old [ former ] ·rule [ commandment ; regulation ] is now ·set aside [ nullified ; abolished ] , because it was weak and ·useless [ ineffective ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	19	The law [ C of Moses ] could not make anything perfect . But now a better hope has been given to us , and ·with [ by means of ; through ] this hope we can ·come near to [ approach ] God .
EXB	Hebrews	7	20	·It is important that God did this with an oath [ L And it was not without an oath ] . Others became priests without an oath ,
EXB	Hebrews	7	21	but ·Christ [ L he ] became a priest with an oath , ·when God said [ L by the one who said ] to him : “ The Lord has ·made a promise [ L sworn ; C an oath ] and will not change his mind . ‘ You are a priest forever [ v.
EXB	Hebrews	7	22	·This means that [ Because of this oath , ] Jesus is the guarantee of a better ·agreement from God to his people [ covenant ; contract ; 8:7–13 ; Jer . 31:31–34 ; C the new covenant is greater than the old ( the law of Moses ) because it provides true forgiveness of sins ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	23	When one of the other priests died , he could not continue being a priest . So there were many priests .
EXB	Hebrews	7	24	But because Jesus ·lives [ remains ; abides ] forever , he ·will never stop serving as priest [ L has a permanent/eternal priesthood ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	25	So he is able ·always to save [ or to save completely/forever ] those who come to God through him because he always lives , ·asking God to help [ interceding for ] them .
EXB	Hebrews	7	26	·Jesus is the kind of high priest we need [ L For such a high priest is indeed suited/fitting for us ] . He is holy , ·sinless [ innocent ; blameless ] , ·pure [ undefiled ] , ·not influenced by [ set apart from ] sinners , and he is ·raised above the heavens [ or having the highest place in heaven ] .
EXB	Hebrews	7	27	He is not like the other priests who had to offer sacrifices every day , first for their own sins , and then for the sins of the people . Christ offered his sacrifice only once and for all time [ 9:12 ; 10:10 ] when he offered himself .
EXB	Hebrews	7	28	The law ·chooses [ designates ; appoints ] high priests who are people with weaknesses [ 5:2 ] , but the word of God ’ s oath came later than the law . It made God ’ s Son to be the high priest , and that Son has been made perfect forever [ 2:10 ; 5:9 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	8	8	But God ·found something wrong with his people and said [ or found fault with the covenant , and said to his people ] : [ a ] “ ·Look [ T Behold ] , the ·time is [ days are ] coming , says the Lord , when I will ·make [ complete ; establish ] a new ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] with the ·people [ L house ] of Israel and the ·people [ L house ] of Judah .
EXB	Hebrews	8	2	Our high priest ·serves [ ministers ; performs priestly service ] in the ·Most Holy Place [ sanctuary ; L holy things ] , the true ·place of worship [ Tabernacle ; Holy Tent ; Ex . 33:7 ] that was made by the Lord , not by humans .
EXB	Hebrews	8	3	[ L For ] Every high priest ·has the work of offering [ is appointed to offer ] gifts and sacrifices to God . So our high priest must also ·offer something to God [ L have something to offer ] .
EXB	Hebrews	8	4	If our high priest were now living on earth , he would not be a priest , because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God .
EXB	Hebrews	8	5	·The work they do as priests [ or The sanctuary in which they serve ] is only a ·copy [ model ; prototype ] and a shadow of what is in heaven . This is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the ·Holy Tent [ T Tabernacle ] : “ Be very careful to make everything by the ·plan [ pattern ; design ] I showed you on the mountain [ Ex . 25:40 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	8	6	But the priestly ·work [ service ; ministry ] that has been given to Jesus is ·much greater than [ far superior to ] the work that was given to the other priests . In the same way , the new ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] that Jesus ·brought from God to his people [ L mediates ] is much ·greater [ better ] than the old one . And the new ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] is ·based [ founded ; legally enacted ] on ·promises of better things [ L better promises ; C all God ’ s promises are reliable , but these promises bring greater blessings ] .
EXB	Hebrews	8	7	If there had been ·nothing wrong [ no fault ] with the first ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ; C given to Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai ] , there would have been no ·need for [ or reason to look for ; or occasion for God to establish ] a second ·agreement [ L one ; C the Mosaic covenant was insufficient because it did not provide true forgiveness of sins ; 10:1 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the ·agreement [ covenant ] I made with their ·ancestors [ forefathers ; fathers ] when I took them by the hand to bring them out of [ L the land of ] Egypt . But they ·broke [ L did not abide by ] that ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] , and I ·turned away from [ abandoned ; stopped caring for ] them , says the Lord .
EXB	Hebrews	8	10	[ For ; But ] This is the ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] I will make with the ·people [ L house ] of Israel ·at that time [ L after those days ] , says the Lord . I will put my ·teachings [ L laws ] in their minds and write them on their hearts . I will be their God , and they will be my people .
EXB	Hebrews	8	11	People will no longer have to teach their ·neighbors [ fellow citizens ] and ·relatives [ L brothers ( and sisters ) ] ·to know the Lord [ L saying , “ Know the Lord ” ] , because all people will know me , from the least to the ·most important [ greatest ] .
EXB	Hebrews	8	12	I will ·forgive them for [ be merciful with regard to ] ·the wicked things they did [ their unrighteousness/wickedness ] , and I will not remember their sins anymore [ Jer . 31:31–34 ; Luke 22:20 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	8	13	God called this a new ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] , so he has made ·the first agreement [ L the first one ] ·old [ obsolete ; outdated ] . And anything that is ·old [ obsolete ; outdated ] and worn out is ready to disappear . Footnotes - Hebrews 8:8 But … said Some Greek copies read “ But God found something wrong and said to his people . ”
EXB	Hebrews	9	9	This is an ·example [ illustration ; symbol ] for the present time . It shows that the gifts and sacrifices offered can not make the conscience of the worshiper ·perfect [ clear ; pure ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	13	The blood of goats and bulls [ Lev . 16:14–16 ] and the ashes of a ·cow [ young cow ; heifer ; Num . 19:2 , 17–18 ] are sprinkled on the people who are [ C ritually ] unclean , and this ·makes their bodies clean again [ restores their body to ritual purity ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	2	The ·Holy Tent [ T Tabernacle ; Ex . 25:8–9 ; 26:1 ] was ·set up [ constructed ; prepared ] for this . The first area in the Tent was called the Holy Place . In it were the lampstand [ Ex . 25:31–39 ] and the table [ Ex . 25:23–30 ] with the ·bread that was made holy for God [ consecrated bread ; bread of presentation/offering ; Ex . 25:30 ; Lev . 24:5–8 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second curtain was a ·room [ section ; L tent ] called the ·Most Holy Place [ T Holy of Holies ; Ex . 26:31–34 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	4	In it was a golden altar for burning incense [ Lev . 16:12–13 ] and the ·Ark [ box ; chest ] ·that held the old agreement [ L of the covenant/contract ; Ex . 25:10 ; 26:33 ] , covered [ L completely ; on all sides ] with gold . Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna [ Ex . 16:33–34 ] , Aaron ’ s rod that once grew leaves [ Num . 17:1–11 ] , and the stone tablets of the ·old agreement [ covenant ; contract ; Ex . 25:16 ; 40:20 ; Deut . 10:2 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	5	Above the Ark were the ·creatures that showed God ’ s glory [ or glorious cherubim ; Ex . 25:18–22 ; C angelic beings representing God ’ s presence and glory ; Gen. 3:24 ; Ezek . 9:3 ; 10:1–22 ] , ·whose wings reached over [ L overshadowing ] the ·lid [ mercy seat ; atonement cover ; Lev . 16:2 ] . But we can not ·tell everything about [ discuss in detail ] these things now .
EXB	Hebrews	9	6	When everything was made ready in this way , the priests went into the ·first room [ outer room ; L first tent ] ·every day [ regularly ] to ·worship [ serve ; minister ; perform their priestly duties ; Num . 28:3 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	7	But only the high priest could go into the ·second room [ inner room ; L second one ] , and he did that only once a year [ Ex . 30:10 ; Lev . 16:15 ,
EXB	Hebrews	9	34	] . He could never enter the inner room without taking blood [ C from the sacrificial animal ] with him , which he offered to God for himself and for sins the people did ·without knowing they did them [ unintentionally ; in ignorance ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit uses this to show that the way into the ·Most Holy Place [ sanctuary ; L holy things ; T Holy of Holies ] ·was not open [ or had not yet been revealed ] while the ·system of the old Holy Tent [ or outer room of the Tabernacle ; L first tent/Tabernacle ] was still ·being used [ in place ; standing ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	10	These gifts and sacrifices were only about food and drink and special [ ceremonial ; ritual ] washings . They were ·rules for the body [ or external regulations ] , ·to be followed [ in force ; applying ] until the time of God ’ s ·new way [ reformation ; new order ] . The New Agreement
EXB	Hebrews	9	11	But when Christ came as the high priest of the good things ·we now have [ a ] [ L that have come ] , he entered the greater and more perfect ·tent [ T tabernacle ] . It is not made ·by humans [ L with hands ] and does not belong to this ·world [ creation ; created order ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	12	Christ entered the ·Most Holy Place [ sanctuary ; L holy things ; T Holy of Holies ] ·only once—and for all time [ L once for all ; 7:27 ; 10:10 ] . ·He did not take with him [ L …not by means of ] the blood of goats and calves . ·His sacrifice was [ L …but by means of ] his own blood , and by it he ·set us free from sin forever [ L obtained/secured eternal redemption/liberation ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	14	How much more is done by the blood of Christ . He offered himself through the eternal ·Spirit [ or spirit ; C most likely the Holy Spirit , though possibly Christ ’ s own eternal spirit , or as a “ spiritual ” and eternal sacrifice ] as a ·perfect [ unblemished ] sacrifice to God . His blood [ C signifying his sacrificial death ] will make our consciences ·pure [ cleansed ] from ·useless acts [ or acts that lead to death ; L dead works ; 6:1 ] so we may ·serve [ worship ; offer priestly service for ] the living God .
EXB	Hebrews	9	15	; the author develops his illustration from the various meanings of the word ] , it must be proven that the one who wrote that ·will [ last will and testament ] is dead .
EXB	Hebrews	9	16	When there is a ·will [ last will and testament ; C the same Greek word translated “ agreement ” in v.
EXB	Hebrews	9	17	[ L For ; Because ] A ·will [ last will and testament ] ·means nothing [ carries no force ] while the person is alive ; it can ·be used [ take effect ] only after the person dies .
EXB	Hebrews	9	18	This is why even the first ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ; C the same Greek word as “ will ” in vv . 16–17 ] could not ·begin [ be inaugurated/put into effect ] without blood [ C the death of a sacrificial animal ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	19	First , Moses told all the people every command in the law . Next he took the blood of calves [ b ] and mixed it with water . Then he used ·red [ scarlet ] wool and a branch of the hyssop plant to sprinkle it on the book of the law and on all the people .
EXB	Hebrews	9	20	He said , “ This is the blood ·that begins [ that seals/confirms ; L of ] the ·Agreement [ Covenant ; Contract ] that God commanded you to ·obey [ keep ; Ex . 24:8 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	9	21	In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the ·Holy Tent [ T Tabernacle ] and over all the ·things [ vessels ; utensils ] used in worship .
EXB	Hebrews	9	22	The law says that almost everything must be ·made clean [ purified ; cleansed ] by blood , and sins can not be forgiven without ·blood to show death [ the shedding of blood ; C signifying death to pay the penalty of sin ] . Christ ’ s Death Takes Away Sins
EXB	Hebrews	9	23	So the ·copies [ symbols ; models ; prototypes ] of the real things in heaven had to be ·made clean [ purified ; cleansed ] by animal sacrifices . But the real things in heaven need much better sacrifices .
EXB	Hebrews	9	24	[ L For ] Christ did not go into ·the Most Holy Place [ a sanctuary ; L holy things ] made by ·humans [ L hands ] , which is only a ·copy [ model ; or prefiguration ] of the real one . He went into heaven itself and ·is there [ appears ] now ·before [ in the presence of ] God ·to help us [ for us ; on our behalf ] .
EXB	Hebrews	9	25	The high priest enters the ·Most Holy Place [ sanctuary ; L holy things ; T Holy of Holies ] once every year with blood that is not his own . But Christ did not offer himself many times .
EXB	Hebrews	9	26	; 10:10 ] at the ·end [ culmination ; climax ] of ·the present age [ time ; L the ages ] to ·take away all [ nullify ; abolish ] sin by sacrificing himself .
EXB	Hebrews	9	27	Just as ·everyone [ L people ] ·must [ is/are destined/appointed to ] die once and ·then be judged [ T after this the judgment ] ,
EXB	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to ·take away [ bear ] the sins of many people [ Is . 53:12 ] . And he will ·come [ appear ] a second time , not to offer himself for sin , but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:11 good … have Some Greek copies read “ good things that are to come. ” - Hebrews 9:19 calves Some Greek copies read “ calves and goats . ”
EXB	Hebrews	10	10	And ·because of this [ L by God ’ s will/desire/intention ] , we are ·made holy [ sanctified ; set apart to God ] through the sacrifice Christ made in his body ·once and for all time [ L once for all ; 7:27 ; 9:12 ,
EXB	Hebrews	10	2	If the law could make them perfect , the sacrifices would have already ·stopped [ ceased ; been abolished ] . The worshipers would ·be made clean [ L have been cleansed/purified once for all ; C forever ] , and they would no longer have a ·sense of [ consciousness of ; feeling of guilt about ] sin .
EXB	Hebrews	10	3	But these sacrifices remind them of their sins every year ,
EXB	Hebrews	10	4	because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
EXB	Hebrews	10	5	So when ·Christ [ L he ] came into the world , he said : “ You did not ·want [ desire ] sacrifices and offerings , but you have ·prepared a body for me [ or given me a body ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	6	] . ” ( These are all sacrifices that the law ·commands [ requires ; prescribes ] . )
EXB	Hebrews	10	7	] . ” God ·ends [ abolishes ; takes away ] the ·first system of sacrifices [ L first ] so he can ·set up [ establish ] the ·new system [ L second ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	8	In this Scripture ·he first said [ or cited above he said ] , “ You did not ·want [ desire ] sacrifices and offerings . You ·did not ask for [ were not pleased with ; took no delight in ] burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins [ v.
EXB	Hebrews	10	9	Then he said , “ ·Look [ or Here I am ; T Behold ] , I have come to do ·what you want [ your will ; v.
EXB	Hebrews	10	26	If we ·decide to [ deliberately ] go on sinning after we have learned the ·truth [ L knowledge of the truth ] , there is no longer any sacrifice for sins .
EXB	Hebrews	10	11	·Every day [ Day after day ] ·the priests [ L every priest ] stand and do their ·religious [ priestly ] service , ·often [ again and again ] offering the same sacrifices . Those sacrifices can never take away sins .
EXB	Hebrews	10	12	But after ·Christ [ L this one ; C this priest ] offered one sacrifice for sins , forever , he sat down at the right ·side [ L hand ] of God [ 1:3 ,
EXB	Hebrews	10	13	And now ·Christ [ L he ] waits there for his enemies to be ·put under his power [ L made a footstool for his feet ; 1:13 ; Ps . 110:1b ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	14	With one ·sacrifice [ offering ] he made perfect forever those who are being ·made holy [ sanctified ; set apart to God ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also ·tells [ testifies/bears witness to ] us about this . First he says :
EXB	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the ·agreement [ covenant ; contract ] I will make with them ·at that time [ L after those days ] , says the Lord . I will put my ·teachings [ laws ] in their hearts and write them on their minds [ 8:10 ; Jer . 31:33 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	10	17	Then he says : “ Their sins and ·the evil things they do [ their lawless/wicked actions ] — I will not remember anymore [ 8:12 ; Jer . 31:34 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	10	18	Now when these have been forgiven , there is no more need for a ·sacrifice [ offering ] for sins . Continue to Trust God
EXB	Hebrews	10	19	So , brothers and sisters , ·we are completely free [ L since we have confidence… ; C this “ since ” clause continues through v.
EXB	Hebrews	10	22	let us come near to God with a ·sincere [ true ] heart and a ·sure [ confident ] faith , because we have ·been made free [ L had our hearts sprinkled ; C sacrificial blood was sprinkled on people and things to purify them ] from a ·guilty [ evil ] conscience , and our bodies have been washed with pure water [ C water was used in Judaism for ritual purification ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	20	We can enter through a new and living way that Jesus ·opened [ or restored ; renewed ; or inaugurated ] for us . It leads through the curtain—Christ ’ s ·body [ T flesh ; C like the curtain of the Most Holy Place , Christ ’ s body , sacrificed for us , provides access to the presence of God ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	21	And since we have a great priest over God ’ s house ,
EXB	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold ·firmly [ without wavering ] to the hope that we have confessed , because ·we can trust God to do what he promised [ L the one who promised is faithful ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	24	Let us think about ·each other and help each other [ or how to provoke/rouse/encourage each another ] to show love and do good deeds .
EXB	Hebrews	10	25	You should not ·stay away from [ neglect ; forsake ] ·the church meetings [ meeting together ] , as some are doing [ C some were abandoning Christianity and returning to Judaism ] , but you should encourage each other [ C to stay faithful to Christ and to other believers ] , and even more so as you see the day coming [ C the day of the Lord , when Christ will return ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	27	There is nothing but ·fear in waiting for the [ a fearful/terrifying expectation/prospect of ] judgment and the ·terrible [ raging ; furious ] fire that will ·destroy [ consume ; devour ] ·all those who live against God [ the enemies of God ; L those who oppose ; the adversaries ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who ·refused to obey [ rejected ; disregarded ] the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the basis of the ·evidence [ testimony ] provided by two or three witnesses [ Deut . 17:6 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	10	29	So how much worse punishment do you think is deserved by those who ·do not respect [ trample on ; show contempt for ] the Son of God , who ·look at the blood of the agreement that made them holy as no different from others ’ blood [ L profane/treat as unholy/common the blood of the covenant ] , who insult the Spirit of God ’ s grace ?
EXB	Hebrews	10	30	We know that God said , “ ·I will punish those who do wrong [ T Vengeance is mine ] ; I will repay them [ Deut . 32:35 ] . ” And he also said , “ The Lord will judge his people [ Deut . 32:36 ; Ps . 135:14 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a ·terrible [ dreadful ; terrifying ] thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
EXB	Hebrews	10	32	Remember those ·days in the past [ or early days of your faith ] when you first ·learned the truth [ L were enlightened ] . You ·remained strong [ endured ; persevered ] through a hard struggle with many sufferings .

EXB	Hebrews	12	20	[ L For ] They ·did not want to hear [ could not bear/endure ] the command : “ If anything , even an animal , touches the mountain , it must be put to death with stones [ Ex . 19:12–13 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	12	21	] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion [ C another name for Jerusalem , here meaning the spiritual city of God ’ s people ; Gal . 4:26 ; Rev . 21:2 ] , to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem [ 11:10 ] .

EXB	Hebrews	12	24	You have come to Jesus , the ·One who brought [ mediator of ] the new ·agreement from God to his people [ covenant ; contract ; 8:1–13 ; Jer . 31:31–34 ] , and you have come to the sprinkled blood [ C Jesus ’ blood shed on the cross ; Heb . 9:19–22 ] that ·has a better message [ speaks of something better ; or pleads more insistently ] than the blood of Abel [ C murdered by his brother Cain ; Abel ’ s “ blood cried out ” to God for vengeance ( Gen. 4:10 ) , but Jesus ’ blood cries out with a message of forgiveness and reconciliation ] .
EXB	Hebrews	12	25	So ·be careful and [ see that you ] do not refuse to listen when God speaks . If those who refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth did not escape , how much worse will it be for us if we refuse to listen to God who warns us from heaven ?
EXB	Hebrews	12	26	When he spoke ·before [ then ] , his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , “ Once again I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens [ Hag . 2:6 ,
EXB	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ once again ” clearly show us that everything that was made—things that can be shaken—will be ·destroyed [ removed ] . [ So that ] Only the things that can not be shaken will remain .
EXB	Hebrews	12	28	So let us be thankful , because we ·have [ are receiving ] a kingdom that can not be shaken . [ As a result ; or In this way ] We should worship God in a way that pleases him with ·respect [ reverence ; devotion ] and ·fear [ awe ] ,
EXB	Hebrews	12	29	because our God is ·like a fire that burns things up [ L a consuming/devouring fire ; Deut . 4:24 ; 9:3 ] .

EXB	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage should be honored by everyone , and ·husband and wife should keep their marriage [ L the marriage bed should be kept ] ·pure [ undefiled ] . God will ·judge as guilty [ L judge ] ·those who take part in sexual sins [ L the sexually immoral and adulterers ] .
EXB	Hebrews	13	5	Keep your lives free from the love of money , and be ·satisfied [ content ] with what you have . [ L For ] God has said , “ I will never leave you ; I will never ·abandon [ T forsake ] you [ Deut . 31:6 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	13	6	So we can be ·sure [ confident ; bold ] when we say , “ I will not be afraid , because the Lord is my helper . ·People can ’ t do anything [ L What can people do… ? ] to me [ Ps . 118:6 ] . ”
EXB	Hebrews	13	7	Remember your leaders who ·taught [ proclaimed ; spoke ] God ’ s ·message [ word ] to you . ·Remember [ Consider ; Reflect on ] ·how they lived and died [ or the outcome/result of their way of life ] , and ·copy [ imitate ] their faith .
EXB	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever .
EXB	Hebrews	13	9	Do not let all kinds of strange teachings ·lead you into the wrong way [ take you off course ; lead you astray ] . ·Your hearts should be strengthened by [ or Inner strength comes from ] God ’ s grace , not by obeying rules about foods [ C referring to Jewish dietary laws ; Lev .
EXB	Hebrews	13	11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the ·Most Holy Place [ sanctuary ; L holy things ; T Holy of Holies ] where he offers this blood for sins . But the bodies of the animals are burned outside the camp [ Lev . 6:11 ] .
EXB	Hebrews	13	10	We have a ·sacrifice [ L altar ] , but the priests who serve in the ·Holy Tent [ T Tabernacle ] · can not [ L have no authority/right to ] eat from it .
EXB	Hebrews	13	12	So Jesus also suffered outside the ·city [ L gate ] to ·make his people holy [ sanctify the people ] ·with [ through ] his own blood .
EXB	Hebrews	13	14	[ L For ] Here on earth we do not have a city that ·lasts forever [ endures ] , but we are ·looking for [ seeking ] the city that ·we will have in the future [ is to come ] .
EXB	Hebrews	13	15	So through Jesus let us ·always [ continuously ] offer to God our sacrifice of praise , ·coming from [ L which is the fruit of ] lips that ·speak [ profess ; acknowledge ] his name .
EXB	Hebrews	13	16	Do not ·forget [ neglect ] to do good to others , and share with them , because such sacrifices please God .
EXB	Hebrews	13	17	·Obey [ or Have confidence in ] your leaders and ·act under [ or submit to ] their authority . [ L For ; Because ] They are watching over you , because they ·are responsible [ will give an account ( to God ) ] for ·your souls [ or you ] . ·Obey them [ Do this ; Act this way ] so that they will do this work with joy , not ·sadness [ or complaint ; groaning ] , for that would be of no ·benefit [ advantage ; help ] to you .
EXB	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us . We are ·sure [ convinced ] that we have a clear conscience , ·because [ or and ] we always want to ·do the right thing [ act honorably ] .

EXB	James	1	3	because you know that these troubles test your faith , and this will give you ·patience [ perserverance ; endurance ] .
EXB	James	1	4	[ L And ] Let your ·patience [ perserverance ; endurance ] ·show itself perfectly in what you do [ have its full effect ; finish its work ] . Then you will be ·perfect and complete [ mature and whole ; or completely mature ] and will ·have everything you need [ L lack nothing ] .
EXB	James	1	5	But if any of you ·needs [ lacks ] wisdom , you should ask God for it [ Prov . 2:6 ] . He is generous to everyone and will give you wisdom ·without criticizing you [ without finding fault ; ungrudgingly ; Matt . 7:7 ] .
EXB	James	1	6	But when you ask God , you must ·believe [ ask with faith ] and not doubt . Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea , ·blown up and down [ driven and tossed ] by the wind . True Riches
EXB	James	1	9	·Believers [ Brothers or sisters ] who are ·poor [ in lowly/humble circumstances ] should ·take pride [ boast ] ·that God has made them spiritually rich [ in being raised up ; in their exaltation ; in their high position ] .
EXB	James	1	10	[ L But ] Those who are ·rich [ wealthy ] should ·take pride [ boast ] ·that God has shown them that they are spiritually poor [ in their humiliation ; in their lowly state ; Jer . 9:23–24 ] . [ L Because ] The rich will ·die [ pass away ; wither ] like a ·wild flower in the grass [ or flower in the field ] .
EXB	James	1	11	[ L For ] The sun rises with ·burning [ scorching ] heat and ·dries up [ withers ] the ·plants [ or grass ] . The flower falls off , and its beauty is ·gone [ destroyed ] . In the same way the rich will ·die [ L wither away ] ·while they are still taking care of business [ in the midst of their pursuits ; L in his journeys ; Ps . 49:16–17 ; 103:15–16 ; Is . 40:6–8 ] .

EXB	James	1	13	When people are ·tempted [ undergoing a trial ] , they should not say , “ God is tempting me. ” [ L For ] God can not be tempted by evil , and he himself does not tempt anyone .
EXB	James	1	14	But ·people are [ L each person is ] tempted when their own evil desire ·leads [ lures ; drags ] them away and ·traps [ entices ; lures ] them .
EXB	James	1	15	·This desire leads to sin [ L Then , after desire is conceived , it gives birth to sin ] , and then the sin ·grows [ or becomes full-grown ] and ·brings [ gives birth to ] death .
EXB	James	1	16	My ·dear [ beloved ] brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , do not be ·fooled [ deceived ] about this .
EXB	James	1	17	Every good ·action [ or act of giving ] and every perfect gift ·is from God [ L comes from above ] .

EXB	James	1	20	·because anger will not help you live the right kind of life God wants [ L because human anger does not produce God ’ s righteousness ] .
EXB	James	1	21	So ·put out of your life [ get rid of ; lay aside ] every ·evil thing [ moral filth/defilement ] and every ·kind of wrong [ excessive evil ] . Then in ·gentleness [ humility ] ·accept [ welcome ] God ’ s ·teaching [ word ] that is planted in your hearts , which can save ·you [ L your souls ; C referring to the whole person ] .
EXB	James	1	22	·Do what God ’ s teaching says ; when you only listen and do nothing , you are fooling yourselves [ L Be doers of the word , and not only hearers , deceiving yourselves ; Luke 11:28 ; Rom . 2:13 ] .
EXB	James	1	23	Those who hear God ’ s ·teaching [ word ] and do nothing are like people who look at ·themselves [ their natural face ; L the face of their birth ] in a mirror .
EXB	James	1	24	[ L For ] They ·see their faces [ gaze at themselves ] and then go away and quickly forget what they looked like .
EXB	James	1	25	But ·the truly happy people are [ L blessed are ] those who ·carefully study [ look intently into ; L stoop down to look at ] God ’ s perfect law that makes people free [ C probably refers to the law of Moses as it is fulfilled in Christ ; 2:8 ,
EXB	James	1	26	People who think they are religious but ·say things they should not say [ L do not bridle their tongues ; 3:1–12 ; 4:11–12 ] are just ·fooling [ deceiving ] themselves . Their “ religion ” is ·worth nothing [ empty ; meaningless ] .
EXB	James	1	27	Religion that God the Father accepts as pure and ·without fault [ undefiled ] is this : caring for orphans and widows [ 2:1–13 , 15–16 ; Ex . 22:22 ; Deut . 14:29 ] ·who need help [ L in their trouble/distress/persecution ] , and keeping yourself ·free from the world ’ s evil influence [ L unstained/unpolluted by the world ; 4:4–10 ] .

EXB	James	2	3	You ·show special attention to [ take notice of ; look favorably on ] the one wearing nice clothes and say , “ Please , sit here in this good seat. ” But you say to the poor person , “ Stand over there , ” or , “ Sit on the floor ·by my feet [ or beside my footstool ] . ”
EXB	James	2	4	·What are you doing ? You are making some people more important than others [ L Are you not discriminating among yourselves… ? ] , and ·with evil thoughts you are deciding that one person is better [ or you are judging with evil thoughts ; or you are acting like judges with evil motives ] .
EXB	James	2	5	Listen , my ·dear [ L beloved ] brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] ! ·God chose [ L Did not God choose… ? ] the poor in the world [
EXB	James	2	1	Cor . 1:26–29 ] to be rich with faith and to ·receive [ L be heirs of ] the kingdom God promised to those who love him [ Luke 6:20 ] .
EXB	James	2	6	But you ·show no respect to [ dishonor ; have insulted ] the poor . ·The rich are always trying to control your lives . They are the ones who take you to court [ L Don ’ t the rich exploit/oppress you and drag you into court ? ] .
EXB	James	2	7	·And they are the ones who speak against Jesus , who owns you [ or Don ’ t they slander the noble/good name by which you were called ? L Don ’ t they blaspheme the noble/good name that was invoked over you ? C The “ name ” may be the person ’ s name or the name of Jesus , to whom they belong ] .
EXB	James	2	8	This royal law [ C because God the king decreed it , or because it is the supreme law ] is found in the Scriptures : “ Love your neighbor as you love yourself [ Lev . 19:18 ; Matt . 22:37–40 ] . ” ·If you [ or If you really ; or If you , however , ] ·obey [ fulfill ; carry out ] this law , you are doing ·right [ well ] .
EXB	James	2	9	But if you ·treat one person as being more important than another [ show favoritism/partiality ; 2:1 ] , you are sinning . You are ·guilty of breaking God ’ s law [ L convicted by the law as lawbreakers/ transgressors ] .
EXB	James	2	10	[ L For ] A person who ·follows [ keeps ; obeys ] all of God ’ s law but ·fails to obey even one command [ L stumbles/falls in one point ] is guilty of breaking all the commands in that law .
EXB	James	2	11	[ L For ] The same God who said , “ You must not ·be guilty of [ commit ] adultery [ Ex . 20:14 ; Deut . 5:18 ] , ” also said , “ You must not murder anyone [ Ex . 20:13 ; Deut . 5:17 ] . ” So if you do not ·take part in [ commit ] adultery but you murder someone , ·you are guilty of breaking all of God ’ s law [ L you have become a breaker/transgressor of the law ; Matt . 5:18–19 ; Gal . 5:3 ] .
EXB	James	2	12	·In everything you say and do , remember that you [ L So speak and so act as those who ] will be judged by the law ·that makes people free [ L of freedom/liberty ] .
EXB	James	2	13	·So you must show mercy to others , or God will not show mercy to you when he judges you [ L For judgment is without mercy to the one who does not act mercifully ] . ·But the person who shows mercy can stand without fear at the judgment [ L But mercy triumphs over judgment ] . Faith and Good Works
EXB	James	2	14	My brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , if people ·say [ claim ] they have faith , but do nothing , ·their faith is worth nothing [ what good/profit/gain is it ? ] . Can faith like that save them ?
EXB	James	2	15	[ L Suppose ; If ] A brother or sister in Christ ·might need clothes or food [ L is naked and lacks daily food ] .
EXB	James	2	16	If you say to that person , “ ·God be with you [ or I wish you well ; L Go in peace ] ! ·I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat , [ T Be warmed and filled ] ” but you do not ·give what that person needs [ provide for the needs of their body ] , ·your words are worth nothing [ L what good/profit/gain is that ? ] .
EXB	James	2	17	In the same way , faith by itself—·that does nothing [ L if it does not have works ] —is dead .
EXB	James	2	18	[ L But ] Someone might say , “ You have faith , but I have ·deeds [ works ] . ” ·Show me [ Prove ; Demonstrate ] your faith without ·doing anything [ L works ] , and I will ·show you [ prove ; demonstrate ] my faith by ·what I do [ my works ] .
EXB	James	2	19	You believe ·there is one God [ or that God is one ; Deut . 6:4 ] . ·Good [ L You do well ] ! But the demons believe that , too , and they ·tremble with fear [ shudder ] .
EXB	James	2	20	You ·foolish [ senseless ; emptyheaded ] person ! ·Must you be shown [ Do you want evidence ; Can ’ t you see ] that faith ·that does nothing [ without works ] is ·worth nothing [ useless ; barren ] ?
EXB	James	2	21	Abraham , our ·ancestor [ father ; patriarch ; Gen. 12:1–3 ] , was ·made right with God [ justified ] by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar [ Gen.
EXB	James	2	22	So you see that Abraham ’ s faith and ·the things he did [ his works ] worked together . His faith was made ·perfect [ complete ] by ·what he did [ his works ] .
EXB	James	2	23	This ·shows the full meaning of [ fulfills ] the Scripture that says : “ Abraham believed God , and ·God accepted Abraham ’ s faith , and that faith made him right with God [ L it was credited/counted to him as righteousness ; Gen. 15:6 ] . ” And Abraham was called God ’ s friend [
EXB	James	2	24	So you see that people are ·made right with God [ justified ] by ·what they do [ their works ] , not by faith only .
EXB	James	2	25	·Another example is Rahab , the prostitute , who was ·made right with God [ justified ] by ·something she did [ works ] . She welcomed the ·spies [ L messengers ; envoys ] into her home and ·helped them escape [ L sent them out ] by a different road [ Josh .
EXB	James	2	26	Just as a person ’ s body that does not have a spirit [ C the force of life that animates the body ; Gen. 2:7 ] is dead , so faith ·that does nothing [ T without works ] is dead !
EXB	James	3	3	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us , we ·can control [ guide ; direct ] their whole bodies .
EXB	James	3	2	We all ·make many mistakes [ L stumble in many ways ] . If people ·never said anything wrong [ L did not stumble in speech/teaching/word ] , they would be perfect and able to ·control their entire selves , too [ L bridle their whole body also ] .
EXB	James	3	4	Also a ship is very big , and it is pushed by ·strong [ fierce ] winds . But a very small rudder ·controls [ guides ; steers ] that big ship , making it go wherever the pilot wants .
EXB	James	3	5	It is the same with the tongue . It is a small ·part [ member ] of the body , but it ·brags [ boasts ] about great things . A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame .
EXB	James	3	6	And the tongue is like a fire . It is a whole world of ·evil [ iniquity ; unrighteousness ] among ·the parts of our bodies [ L our members ] . The tongue ·spreads its evil through [ pollutes ; stains ; corrupts ] the whole body . The tongue is set on fire by hell [ L Gehenna ; C a valley outside of Jerusalem where in the OT period children were sacrificed to a pagan god ; later used as a burning trash heap ; a metaphor for hell ] , and it starts a fire that influences ·all of life [ L the wheel of birth/life ] .
EXB	James	3	7	[ L For ] People can tame every ·kind [ species ] of wild animal , bird , reptile , and ·fish [ L sea creature ] , and they have tamed them ,
EXB	James	3	8	but no one can tame the tongue . It is ·wild and evil [ or a restless evil ; or an uncontrollable evil ] and full of deadly poison .
EXB	James	3	9	·We use our tongues to [ L With it we ] ·praise [ bless ] our Lord and Father , but ·then [ L with it ] we curse people , whom God made ·like himself [ L in his likeness ; Gen. 1:27 ] .
EXB	James	3	10	Praises and curses come from the same mouth ! My ·brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , this should not happen .
EXB	James	3	11	Do ·good [ fresh ; L sweet ] and ·bad [ stale ; or salt ; L bitter ] water flow from the same [ L opening of a ] spring ?
EXB	James	3	12	My ·brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , can a fig tree make olives , or can a grapevine make figs ? No ! ·And a well full of salty water can not give good water [ L Neither can salt water make sweet ] . True Wisdom
EXB	James	3	13	Are there those among you who are truly wise and ·understanding [ insightful ; discerning ] ? Then they should show it by ·living right [ their good life/conduct/lifestyle ] and ·doing good things [ their deeds/works ] with a ·gentleness [ humility ; meekness ; Matt . 5:5 ; 11:29 ; Gal . 6:1 ] that comes from wisdom .
EXB	James	3	14	But if you have bitter ·jealousy [ or envy ] and ·are selfish [ have selfish ambition ] in your hearts , do not ·brag [ boast ; Jer . 9:23–24 ] . Your ·bragging [ boasting ] is a lie ·that hides [ that denies ; L against ] the truth [ or Don ’ t cover up the truth with bragging or lying ] .
EXB	James	3	15	That kind of “ wisdom ” does not come ·from God [ L down from above ; C that is , from heaven ] but ·from the world [ is earthly ] . It is ·not spiritual [ natural ; “ soulish ” ; C human life apart from God ;
EXB	James	3	1	Cor . 2:14 ] ; it is ·from the devil [ demonic ] .
EXB	James	3	16	Where ·jealousy [ or envy ] and ·selfishness [ selfish ambition ] are , there will be ·confusion [ chaos ; disorder ] and every ·kind of evil [ evil thing/practice ] .
EXB	James	3	17	But the wisdom that comes from ·God [ L above ; 3:15 ] is first of all pure , then peaceful [ peace-loving ] , gentle [ patient ; considerate ] , and ·easy to please [ or willing to yield ; or open to reason ] . This wisdom is ·always ready to help those who are troubled and to do good for others [ L full of mercy and good fruits ] . It is ·always fair [ impartial ] and ·honest [ sincere ; unhypocritical ] .
EXB	James	3	18	·People who work for peace in a peaceful way plant a good crop of right living [ or Peacemakers who sow with peace will harvest a crop of justice/righteousness ; Gal . 5:22–23 ] .
EXB	James	4	4	·So , you are not loyal to God [ L You adulterers ! ; C often adultery is used in a spiritual sense for betraying God ; Jer . 3:20 ] ! ·You should know [ L Don ’ t you know… ? ] that ·loving [ L friendship with ] the world is ·the same as hating [ L hostility/enmity toward ] God . Anyone who wants to be a friend of the world becomes God ’ s enemy .
EXB	James	4	2	You ·want [ desire ] things , but you ·do not [ or can not ] have them . So you ·are ready to kill [ L murder ] and are ·jealous [ envious ] of other people , but you still can not get what you want . So you argue and ·fight [ wage war ] . You do not get what you want , because you do not ask God .
EXB	James	4	3	Or when you ask , you do not receive because ·the reason you ask is wrong [ or you ask with the wrong motives ; L you ask badly/wrongly ] . You want things so you ·can use [ L spend ] them for your own pleasures .
EXB	James	4	5	Do you think the Scripture ·means nothing that says [ or says for no reason ] , · “ The Spirit that God made to live in us wants us for himself alone ” ? [ or “ God yearns jealously for the spirit he has made to live in us ” ? ; or “ The spirit God placed within us tends to jealously desire things ” ? ; C for God ’ s jealousy for his people see Ex . 20:5 ; 34:14 ; Zech . 8:2 ] .
EXB	James	4	6	But God gives us even more grace , as ·the Scripture [ L it ; or he ] says , “ God ·is against [ opposes ; resists ] the proud , but he gives grace to the humble [ Prov . 3:34 ;
EXB	James	4	1	Pet . 5:6 ] . You Are Not the Judge
EXB	James	4	7	So ·give yourselves completely [ submit ] to God . ·Stand against [ Resist ] the devil [
EXB	James	4	8	Come near to God , and God will come near to you . You sinners , ·clean sin out of your lives [ L cleanse/purify your hands ; C a metaphor for cleaning up your behavior ] . ·You who are trying to follow God and the world at the same time [ L You double-minded ones ] , ·make your thinking pure [ L purify your hearts ; C a metaphor for cleaning up your interior life ] .
EXB	James	4	9	·Be sad [ Lament ] , ·cry [ mourn ] , and weep ! Change your laughter into ·crying [ mourning ] and your joy into ·sadness [ gloom ; sorrow ] .
EXB	James	4	10	Humble yourself in the Lord ’ s presence , and he will ·honor you [ L exalt you ; lift you up ;
EXB	James	4	11	Brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , do not ·tell evil lies about [ slander ] each other [ Lev . 19:16 ] . If you ·speak against [ slander ] your ·fellow believers [ L a brother or sister ] or judge them , you are judging and ·speaking against [ slandering ] the law [ C because the law commanded love ] . And when you are judging the law , you are no longer a ·follower [ L doer ] of the law . You have become a judge [ C sitting in judgment over the law ] .
EXB	James	4	12	·God is the only [ L There is one ] ·Lawmaker [ Lawgiver ] and Judge . He is the only One who can save and destroy [ Matt . 10:28 ] . ·So it is not right for you [ L So who are you… ? ] to judge your neighbor [ Lev . 19:18 ] . Let God Plan Your Life
EXB	James	4	13	·Some of you say [ L Come now , you who say ] , “ Today or tomorrow we will go to some city . We will stay there a year , do business , and make money. ”
EXB	James	4	14	But you do not know what will happen tomorrow ! Your life is like a ·mist [ vapor ; puff of smoke ] . ·You can see it [ It appears ] for a short time , but then it ·goes away [ vanishes ; Prov . 27:1 ] .
EXB	James	4	15	·So [ or Instead ] you should say , “ If the Lord ·wants [ wills ; wishes ] , we will live and do this or that [ Matt . 6:10 ] . ”
EXB	James	4	16	But now you are ·proud [ arrogant ; C probably referring to their plans for the future ] and you brag [ boast ] . All of this bragging [ boasting ] is wrong [ L evil ; wicked ; 3:14 ] .
EXB	James	4	17	[ L Therefore ] Anyone who knows the right thing to do , but does not do it , ·is sinning [ L for him it is sin ] .
EXB	James	5	5	Your life on earth was full of ·rich living [ luxury ] and ·pleasing yourselves with everything you wanted [ pleasure ; self-indulgence ] . You made ·yourselves [ L your hearts ] fat , ·like an animal ready to be killed [ in/for a day of slaughter ; C a farm animal gorging itself , unaware it is being fattened for slaughter ] .
EXB	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted , and your clothes have been eaten by moths .
EXB	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have ·rusted [ corroded ] , and that ·rust [ corrosion ] will be a ·proof that you were wrong [ L witness/testimony/evidence against you ] . It will eat your ·bodies [ flesh ] like fire . You ·saved [ hoarded ; stored up ] your treasure ·for [ or in ] the last days [ C just before judgment day , when such treasures will be useless ] .
EXB	James	5	4	[ L Listen ; T Behold ] The ·pay [ wages ] you ·did not give [ defrauded from ] the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you [ Lev . 19:13 ; Deut . 24:14–15 ] , and the cries of the ·workers [ L harvesters ] have ·been heard by [ L reached the ears of ] the Lord ·All-Powerful [ of Hosts/Armies ; L Sabaoth ; C God ’ s warrior name referring to the angelic army ] .
EXB	James	5	6	You have ·judged guilty [ condemned ] and then murdered innocent people , who ·were not against [ did not resist/oppose ] you . Be Patient
EXB	James	5	7	[ L Therefore ] Brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , be patient until the Lord comes again . [ L See ; T Behold , ] A farmer patiently waits for his ·valuable [ precious ] ·crop [ fruit ] to grow from the earth and for it to receive the ·autumn and spring [ L early and late ] rains [ Deut . 11:14 ] .
EXB	James	5	8	You , too , must be patient . ·Do not give up hope [ L Strengthen your hearts ] , because ·the Lord is coming soon [ L the Lord ’ s coming draws near/is at hand ] .
EXB	James	5	9	Brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , do not ·complain [ grumble ] against each other or you will be judged guilty [ Matt . 7:1 ] . ·And [ L Look ; T Behold ] the Judge is ·ready to come [ L standing at the door ] !
EXB	James	5	10	Brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , follow the example of the prophets who spoke ·for [ L in the name of ] the Lord . They suffered many hard things , but they ·were patient [ endured ] .
EXB	James	5	11	[ L Look ; or Indeed ] ·We say they are happy [ or We consider them blessed ] because they ·did not give up [ endured ; persevered ] . You have heard about Job ’ s ·patience [ or endurance ; perseverance ] , and you know the Lord ’ s purpose for him in the end . You know the Lord is full of mercy and is ·kind [ compassionate ] . Be Careful What You Say
EXB	James	5	12	My brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , above all , do not ·use an oath when you make a promise [ swear ; take a vow ] . Don ’ t use the name of heaven , earth , or anything else to prove what you say . ·When you mean yes , say only yes , and when you mean no , say only no [ T Let your “ Yes ” be yes and your “ No ” be no ; Matt . 5:33–37 ] so you will not be ·judged guilty [ condemned ] . The Power of Prayer
EXB	James	5	13	Anyone who is ·having troubles [ suffering ] should pray . Anyone who is ·happy [ joyful ] should ·sing praises [ sing psalms ] .
EXB	James	5	14	Anyone who is sick should call the church ’ s elders . They should pray for and ·pour oil on the person [ L anoint that person with olive oil ; C anointing probably indicates dedicating or setting aside the person to God ’ s care ; Mark 6:13 ] in the name of the Lord .
EXB	James	5	15	And the prayer that is said with faith will ·make the sick person well [ save the sick ; C the same Greek word is commonly used for both physical healing and spiritual salvation ] ; the Lord will ·heal [ L raise up ] that person [
EXB	James	5	1	Kin . 17—18 ] . Saving a Soul
EXB	James	5	28	] . And if the person has sinned , the sins will be forgiven .
EXB	James	5	16	[ L Therefore , ] Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you . ·When a believing person prays , great things happen [ L The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective ] .
EXB	James	5	17	Elijah was a human being just like us . He prayed [ earnestly ; L with prayer ] that it would not rain , and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years !
EXB	James	5	18	Then Elijah prayed again , and ·the rain came down from the sky [ or heaven gave rain ] , and the land produced crops again [
EXB	James	5	19	My brothers and sisters [ C fellow believers ] , if one of you ·wanders away [ strays ] from the truth , and someone helps that person come back ,
EXB	James	5	20	·remember [ L know ] this : Anyone who brings a sinner back from the ·wrong way [ L error/wandering of his ways ] will save that sinner ’ s soul from death and will ·cause many sins to be forgiven [ L cover a multitude of sins ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter 1:22 with all your heart Some Greek copies read “ with a pure heart . ”
EXB	1%20Peter	1	2	God the Father ·planned long ago to choose you [ L chose you according to his foreknowledge ] ·by making you his holy people , which is the Spirit ’ s work [ or by the sanctifying/purifying work of the Spirit ; or by setting you apart by means of the Spirit ] . God wanted you to obey him and to be ·made clean [ L sprinkled ] by the blood of the death of Jesus Christ . [ C In the OT blood from animal sacrifices was sprinkled on persons and objects to indicate purification or forgiveness of sins ; Ex . 24:3–8 . ] Grace and peace be ·yours more and more [ L multiplied to you ] . We Have a Living Hope
EXB	1%20Peter	1	3	·Praise be to [ L Blessed be ] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . In God ’ s ·great [ abundant ] mercy he has caused us to be born ·again [ anew ; John 3:5–8 ] into a living hope , ·because Jesus Christ rose [ or by means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ ] from the dead .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	4	·Now we hope for [ or This new birth provides us with ] ·the blessings God has for his children [ L an inheritance ] . ·These blessings [ or This inheritance ] , which can not be destroyed or be ·spoiled [ corrupted ; defiled ] or lose their beauty , ·are [ is ] kept in heaven for you [ Matt . 6:19–21 ; Luke 12:33 ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	5	God ’ s power protects you through your faith until ·salvation is shown to you [ or the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed ] ·at the end of [ in the last ] time .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	6	·This makes you very happy [ or Rejoice in this ] , even though now for a short time ·different kinds of troubles may make you sad [ you have had to suffer various kinds of trials/testings ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	7	These ·troubles [ trials ; testings ] come ·to prove that your faith is pure [ to test and prove the authenticity of your faith ; C a test that proves the genuineness of a valuable metal ] . This ·purity of faith [ or tested and proven authenticity ] is ·worth more [ more precious ; more valuable ] than gold , which can be ·proved to be pure [ tested and proven authentic ] by fire [ Ps . 66:10 ; Prov . 17:3 ; 27:21 ; Zech . 13:9 ; Mal . 3:3 ] but ·can [ or will ] be destroyed . But the ·purity [ tested and proven authenticity ] of your faith will bring you praise and glory and honor ·when Jesus Christ is shown to you [ L at the revelation of Jesus Christ ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	8	You have not seen ·Christ [ L him ] , but still you love him . You can not see him now , but you believe in him . So you ·are filled [ rejoice ] with ·a joy that can not be explained , a joy full of glory [ an inexpressible and glorious joy ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	9	·And you are receiving [ or …because you are receiving ] the ·goal [ outcome ; purpose ] of your faith—the salvation of your souls .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	10	The prophets [ C of the Old Testament ] searched carefully and ·tried to learn [ diligently inquired/investigated ] about this salvation . They prophesied about the grace that was coming to you .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	11	The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets , ·telling [ witnessing ; testifying ] in advance about the sufferings of Christ and about the glory that would follow those sufferings [ Luke 24:25–27 , 45–49 ] . The prophets ·tried to learn [ inquired ; investigated ] about what the Spirit was showing them , ·when those things would happen , and what the world would be like at that time [ about the circumstances and time ; or about the person and time ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	12	It was ·shown [ revealed to ] them that their service was not for themselves but for you , when they ·told about [ announced ] the truths [ L things ] you have now heard . Those who preached the ·Good News [ Gospel ] to you ·told you [ announced ] those things with the help of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven—things into which angels desire to look . A Call to Holy Living
EXB	1%20Peter	1	13	·So [ Therefore ; For this reason ] ·prepare your minds for service [ prepare your minds for action ; or , be alert ; L gird the loins of your mind ] and ·have self-control [ be disciplined ] . ·All your hope should be for [ Focus all your hope on ] the gift of grace that will be ·yours [ brought/given to you ] ·when Jesus Christ is shown to you [ L at the revelation of Jesus Christ ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	14	·Now that you are [ As ; or Like ] obedient ·children of God [ L children ] ·do not live as you did in the past . You did not understand , so you did the evil things you wanted [ L do not be shaped by the desires/lusts of your former ignorance ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	15	But be holy in all ·you do [ your behavior/conduct ] , just as ·God , the One [ L the One ] who called you , is holy .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	16	[ L For ; Because ] It is written in the Scriptures : “ You must be holy , because I am holy [ Lev . 11:45 ; 19:2 ; 20:7 ] . ”
EXB	1%20Peter	1	17	·You pray to God and call him Father , and he [ L Since you address as Father the one who ] judges each person ’ s ·work [ deeds ] ·equally [ impartially ; without prejudice ] . So while you are ·here on earth [ living as exiles/strangers/sojourners ] , you should live with ·respect [ fear ] for God [ Prov . 1:7 ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	18	[ L For ] You know that in the past you were living in a ·worthless [ meaningless ; futile ; vain ; Eccl . 1:2 ] way , a way passed down from ·the people who lived before you [ your ancestors ] . But you were saved [ ransomed ; redeemed ] from that useless life . You were ·bought [ ransomed ; redeemed ; C like a slave whose freedom was purchased by a payment ] , not with something that ·ruins [ perishes ; spoils ] like silver or gold ,
EXB	1%20Peter	1	19	but with the precious blood of Christ [ Is . 52:3 ] , who was like ·a pure and perfect lamb [ a lamb without defect or blemish ; Lev . 1:3 ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	20	Christ was ·chosen [ destined ; L foreknown ] before ·the world was made [ L the foundation/creation of the world ] , but he was ·shown to the world [ revealed ] in these last times for your sake .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	21	Through Christ you ·believe [ have faith/trust ] in God , who raised Christ from the dead and gave him glory . So your faith and your hope are in God .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	22	Now that your obedience to the truth has purified your ·souls [ or lives ] , you can have ·true [ genuine ; sincere ] love for your Christian brothers and sisters . So love each other ·deeply [ earnestly ] ·with all your [ L from the ] heart . [ a ]
EXB	1%20Peter	1	23	You have been born ·again [ or anew ] , and this new life did not come from ·something that dies [ L a perishable seed ] , but from ·something that can not die [ L an imperishable seed ] . You were born ·again [ or anew ] through ·God ’ s living message that continues forever [ L the living and abiding/enduring word of God ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	1	24	·The Scripture says [ L For ; Therefore ] , “ All ·people are [ T flesh is ] like the grass , and all their glory is like the flowers of the ·field [ L grass ] . The grass ·dies [ withers ] and the flowers ·fall [ drop off ] ,
EXB	1%20Peter	1	25	but the word of the Lord ·will live [ remains ; abides ; endures ] forever [ Is . 40:6–8 ] . ” And this is the word that was ·preached [ or proclaimed as Good News/Gospel ] to you . Footnotes -

EXB	1%20Peter	2	2	As newborn babies want milk , you should want the ·pure [ sincere ; unadulterated ] and ·simple [ or spiritual ] ·teaching [ L milk ; C probably referring to the word of God ; see 1:23–25 ] . By it you can ·mature [ grow ; reach maturity ] in your salvation ,
EXB	1%20Peter	2	3	because you have already ·examined and seen [ L tasted ] how good the Lord is [ Ps . 34:8 ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	2	4	Come to the Lord Jesus , the · “ stone ” that lives [ L a living stone ; C Jesus is the most important stone in the spiritual temple described in v.
EXB	1%20Peter	2	5	You also are like living stones , so let yourselves be used to build a spiritual ·temple [ house ] —to be holy priests who offer spiritual sacrifices that are ·acceptable [ pleasing ] to God ·through [ or because they are mediated by ] Jesus Christ .

EXB	1%20Peter	3	17	It is better to suffer for doing good than for doing ·wrong [ evil ] if that is ·what God wants [ the will of God ] .
EXB	1%20Peter	3	18	Christ himself suffered for sins ·once [ or once for all ; C only his suffering has the power to redeem others ] . ·He was not guilty , but he suffered for those who are guilty [ L …the righteous for the unrighteous ] to bring you to God . ·His body was killed [ L He was put to death in the flesh/body ] , but he was made alive in the ·spirit [ or Spirit ; C at his resurrection in a glorified body ] .

EXB	1%20Peter	4	4	·Nonbelievers [ The Gentiles/pagans ] think it is ·strange [ surprising ] that you do not ·do the many wild and wasteful things they do [ L run with them into the same flood/excess of debauchery ] , so they ·insult you [ abuse/slander you ; or blaspheme ] .

EXB	1%20Peter	4	5	But they will have to ·explain [ T give account of ] this to God , who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
EXB	1%20Peter	4	6	For this reason the ·Good News [ Gospel ] was preached to those who are now dead .

EXB	1%20John	4	17	This is how love ·is made perfect [ is made complete ; comes to full expression ] ·in [ or among ] us : that we can ·be without fear [ have boldness ; have confidence ; 2:28 ; 3:21 ; 5:14 ] on the day of judgment , because in this world we are like him [ C probably referring to Christ , our example of love ] .
EXB	1%20John	4	18	·Where God ’ s love is , there is no fear [ L There is no fear in love ] , because ·God ’ s perfect love drives out fear [ T perfect love casts out fear ] .

Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar [ 1:10 ] , because that person does not believe ·what God told us [ L the witness/testimony that God witnessed/testified to ] about his Son .
EXB	1%20John	5	11	This is ·what God told us [ L the witness/testimony ] : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .

EXB	1%20John	5	15	[ L And ] If we know he hears us ·every time we ask him [ in whatever we ask ] , we know we have what we ask from him [ 3:21–22 ; Mark 11:24 ] .
EXB	1%20John	5	16	If anyone sees a brother or sister [ C fellow believer ] sinning ( sin that does not lead to ·eternal death [ L death ] ) , that person should ·pray [ ask ; intercede ] , and God will give the sinner life . I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to ·eternal death [ L death ] . There is ·sin [ or a sin ] that leads to [ eternal ] death [ C probably referring to the false teachers , their rejection of the Spirit ’ s work having put them beyond repentance ; compare Mark 3:29 ] .

EXB	1%20John	5	19	We know that we ·belong to God [ or are children of God ; L are of God ] , but the Evil One controls the whole world .

But ·more than [ not satisfied with ] that , he refuses to ·accept [ welcome ; receive ] the other brothers and sisters ; he even ·stops [ prevents ] those who do want to ·accept [ welcome ; receive ] them and ·puts them out of [ expels them from ] the church .
EXB	3%20John	1	11	·My dear friend [ Beloved ] , do not ·follow [ imitate ] what is ·bad [ evil ] ; ·follow [ imitate ] what is good [

EXB	Revelation	3	6	Everyone who has ears should ·listen to [ hear ; obey ] what the Spirit says to the churches . To the Church in Philadelphia
EXB	Revelation	3	7	“ Write this to the ·angel [ messenger ; see 1:20 ] of the church in ·Philadelphia [ a city in the Roman province of Lydia in western Asia Minor ] : “ This is what the One who is holy and true , who holds the key of David [ C the resurrected Jesus ; holding the key of David signifies access to the king ; Is . 22:22 ] , says . When he opens a door , no one can close it . And when he closes it , no one can open it [ C Jesus controls access to God ] .
EXB	Revelation	3	8	I know ·what you do [ your works ] . I have put an open door before you , which no one can close . I know you have little ·strength [ power ] , but you have ·obeyed my teaching [ L kept my word ] and ·were not afraid to speak [ L have not denied ] my name .
EXB	Revelation	3	9	Those in the synagogue ·that belongs to Satan [ L of Satan ] say they are Jews , but they are not true Jews ; they are liars . I will make them come before you and bow at your feet , and they will ·know [ acknowledge ; learn ] that I have loved you .
EXB	Revelation	3	10	You have ·obeyed my teaching [ L kept my word ] about ·not giving up your faith [ endurance ; perseverance ] . So I will keep you from the ·time [ hour ] of ·trouble [ trial ; testing ] that ·will come [ or is about to come ] to the whole world to test those who live on earth .
EXB	Revelation	3	11	“ I am coming ·soon [ quickly ] . ·Continue strong in your faith [ L Hold on to what you have ] so no one will take away your crown [ C wreath indicating honor or victory ; 2:10 ] .
EXB	Revelation	3	12	I will make those who ·win the victory [ overcome ; conquer ] pillars in the temple of my God [ C an image of stability and security close to the glory of God ] , and they will never have to leave it [ C frequent earthquakes often forced Philadelphians to live outdoors ] . I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God , the new Jerusalem , that comes down out of heaven from my God [ C the believers ’ eternal dwelling place ; see chs . 21—22 ] . I will also write on them my new name .
EXB	Revelation	3	13	Everyone who has ears should ·listen to [ hear ; obey ] what the Spirit says to the churches . To the Church in Laodicea
EXB	Revelation	3	14	“ Write this to the ·angel [ or messenger ; see 1:20 ] of the church in Laodicea [ C a city in Phrygia , a mountainous province of western Asia ] : “ The Amen [ C Hebrew for “ so be it ” ; here referring to Jesus ] , the faithful and true witness , ·the ruler of all God has made [ 1:5 ; Prov . 8:30–31 ; C the resurrected Jesus ] , says this [ L these things ] :
EXB	Revelation	3	15	I know ·what you do [ your works ] , that you are not hot or cold . I wish that you were hot or cold [ C both positive images , alluding to cold refreshing mountain streams and healing hot springs near Laodicea ] !
EXB	Revelation	3	16	But because you are lukewarm—neither hot , nor cold—I am ready to ·spit [ vomit ] you out of my mouth .
EXB	Revelation	3	17	[ L For ] You say , ‘ I am rich , and I have become wealthy and do not need anything. ’ But you do not know that you are really ·miserable [ wretched ] , pitiful , poor , blind , and naked .
EXB	Revelation	3	18	I advise you to buy from me gold ·made pure in [ refined by ] fire so you can be truly rich . Buy from me white clothes [ C indicating purity ] so you can be clothed and so you can cover your shameful nakedness . Buy from me ·medicine [ salve ; ointment ] to put on your eyes so you can truly see .
EXB	Revelation	3	19	“ I ·correct [ rebuke ] and ·punish [ discipline ] those whom I love . So be ·eager to do right [ zealous ; earnest ] , and ·change your hearts and lives [ repent ] .
EXB	Revelation	3	20	·Here I am [ L Look ; T Behold ] ! I stand at the door and knock . If ·you [ L anyone ] hear my voice and open the door , I will come in and eat with you , and you will eat with me .
EXB	Revelation	3	21	“ Those who ·win the victory [ overcome ; conquer ] will sit with me on my throne in the same way that I ·won the victory [ overcame ; conquered ; C over death , by his resurrection ] and sat down with my Father on his throne .
EXB	Revelation	3	22	Everyone who has ears should ·listen to [ hear ; obey ] what the Spirit says to the churches . ”
EXB	Revelation	4	4	Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones with twenty-four elders sitting on them [ C probably angelic leaders ] . They were dressed in white and had golden crowns [ C wreaths symbolizing honor or victory ; see 2:10 ] on their heads .
EXB	Revelation	4	2	Immediately I was in the ·Spirit [ or spirit ; C a state of deep spiritual communion with God ; 1:10 ] , and [ L look ; T behold ] before me was a throne in heaven , and someone was sitting on it .
EXB	Revelation	4	3	The One who sat on the throne looked like precious stones , like jasper and carnelian [ C a symbol of great beauty , purity and value ] . All around the throne was a ·rainbow [ or halo ] ·the color of [ or that looked like ] an emerald .
EXB	Revelation	4	5	Lightning flashes and ·noises and thunder [ or the rumbling of thunder ; C phenomena associated with God ’ s appearance at Mount Sinai ; Ex . 19:16–18 ] came from the throne . Before the throne seven lamps were burning , which are the seven spirits [ C either angels or the “ sevenfold Spirit ” —the Holy Spirit portrayed in his perfection ; 3:1 ] of God .
EXB	Revelation	4	6	Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass , clear like crystal . In the center and around the throne were four living creatures ·with eyes all over them [ full of eyes ] , in front and in back .
EXB	Revelation	4	7	The first living creature was like a lion . The second was like an ·ox [ or calf ] . The third had a face like a man . The fourth was like a flying eagle [ Ezek . 1:10 ; C angelic beings identified with the most powerful example of various species ] .
EXB	Revelation	4	8	] . ”
EXB	Revelation	4	9	[ L Whenever ] These living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to the One who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever .
EXB	Revelation	4	10	Then the twenty-four elders bow down before the One who sits on the throne , and they worship him who lives forever and ever . They ·put their crowns down [ cast/lay their crowns ; 4:4 ] before the throne and say :
EXB	Revelation	4	11	“ You are worthy , our Lord and God , to receive glory and honor and ·power [ strength ] , because you made all things . Everything existed and was made , ·because you wanted it [ by your will ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	5	5	But one of the elders said to me , “ Do not cry ! [ L Look ; T Behold ] The Lion from the tribe of Judah [ C a messianic title ; Gen. 49:9–10 ] , ·David ’ s descendant [ L the root of David ; C a messianic title applied to Christ ; Is . 11:10 ] , has ·won the victory [ overcome ; conquered ] so that he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals. ”
EXB	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a ·powerful [ mighty ] angel ·calling [ proclaiming ] in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
EXB	Revelation	5	3	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who could open the scroll or look inside it .
EXB	Revelation	5	4	I cried ·bitterly [ L much ] because there was no one who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside .
EXB	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw a Lamb [ C Jesus ] standing ·in the center of the throne and in the middle of the four living creatures and the elders [ or between the throne and the living creatures and among the elders ] . The Lamb looked as if he had been ·killed [ slaughtered ; slain ] . He had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God [ C either angels or the “ sevenfold Spirit ” ; see 1:4 ] that were sent into all the world .
EXB	Revelation	5	7	The Lamb came and ·took [ received ] the scroll from the right hand of the One sitting on the throne .
EXB	Revelation	5	8	When he took the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders [ 4:4 ] ·bowed down [ fell ] before the Lamb . Each one of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense , which are the prayers of God ’ s holy people [ Ps . 141:2 ] .
EXB	Revelation	5	9	And they all sang a new song [ Ps . 33:3 ; 40:3 ; 98:1 ] to the Lamb : “ You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals , because you were ·killed [ slaughtered ; slain ] , and with ·the blood of your death [ L your blood ] you ·bought [ ransomed ; purchased ; redeemed ] people for God from every tribe , language , people , and nation .
EXB	Revelation	5	10	You made them to be a kingdom ·of priests [ or and priests ; Ex . 19:6 ] for our God , and they will ·rule [ reign ; C other manuscripts have “ they reign ” ( present tense ) ] on the earth. ”
EXB	Revelation	5	11	Then I looked , and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne , and the four living creatures , and the elders . There were ·thousands and thousands [ L myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands ; C a myriad can mean either ten thousand or many thousands ; here means “ countless ” ] of angels ,
EXB	Revelation	5	12	saying in a loud voice : “ The Lamb who was ·killed [ slaughtered ; slain ] is worthy to receive power , wealth , wisdom , and strength , honor , glory , and ·praise [ or blessing ] ! ”
EXB	Revelation	5	13	Then I heard all creatures in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea saying : “ To the One who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be ·praise [ or blessing ] and honor and glory and power forever and ever. ”
EXB	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said , “ Amen [ C Hebrew for “ so be it ” ] , ” and the elders ·bowed down [ fell ] and worshiped .
EXB	Revelation	6	6	Then I heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures . The voice said , “ A quart of wheat for a ·day ’ s pay [ L denarius ; C a Roman coin equal to a day ’ s wage ] , and three quarts of barley for a ·day ’ s pay [ L denarius ; C inflated prices caused by famine ] , and do not damage the olive oil and wine [ C indicates only partial destruction ; vines and olive trees endured drought better than wheat and barley ] ! ”
EXB	Revelation	6	2	I looked , and ·there before me was [ L look ; T behold ] a white horse . The rider on the horse held a bow [ C signifying war ] , and he was given a crown [ C indicating victory ; see 2:10 ] , and he rode out , ·determined to win the victory [ L conquering and in order to conquer ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb opened the second seal , I heard the second living creature say , “ ·Come [ or Go ; 6:1 ] ! ”
EXB	Revelation	6	4	Then another horse came out , a ·red [ L fiery/bright red ; C possibly signifying blood ] one . Its rider was given ·power [ permission ] to take away peace from the earth and to make people ·kill [ slaughter ] each other , and he was given a ·big [ great ] sword [ C signifying civil war ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	5	When the Lamb opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature say , “ ·Come [ or Go ] ! ” I looked , and ·there before me was [ L look ; T behold ] a black horse [ C indicating mourning brought on by the rider ] , and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand [ C for use in commerce ; Prov . 11:1 ; 16:11 ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say , “ ·Come [ or Go ; 6:1 ] ! ”
EXB	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and ·there before me was [ L look ; T behold ] a ·pale [ or pale green ] horse . Its rider was named death , and Hades [ C the realm of the dead , also known as Sheol ] was following close behind him . They were given ·power [ authority ] over a fourth of the earth to kill people by ·war [ L the sword ] , by ·starvation [ famine ] , by ·disease [ pestilence ; plague ] , and by the wild animals of the earth .
EXB	Revelation	6	9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar [ C probably the bronze altar where sacrifices were offered ] the souls of those who had been ·killed [ slaughtered ; slain ] because ·they were faithful to [ L of ] the word of God and to the ·message [ witness ; testimony ] they had ·received [ or given ; or maintained ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	10	These souls ·shouted [ cried out ] in a loud voice , “ Holy and true ·Lord [ Master ] , how long until you judge the people of the earth and ·punish them for killing us [ L avenge our blood ] ? ”
EXB	Revelation	6	11	Then each one of them was given a white robe [ C signifying high status and purity ] and was told to ·wait [ or rest ] a short time longer . There were still some of their fellow servants and ·brothers and sisters in the service of Christ [ L their brothers ; C the Greek term may include men and women ] who ·must be [ were soon to be ] killed as they were . They had to wait until all of this was ·finished [ fulfilled ; completed ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	12	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the sixth seal , and there was a great earthquake . The sun became black like ·rough black cloth [ L sackcloth made of goat hair ; C clothing used in mourning ] , and the whole moon became red like blood [ C signifying destruction ; apocalyptic literature often describes nature falling apart at the end time ; Joel 2:31 ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	13	And the stars in the sky fell to the earth like ·figs [ or unripe figs ] falling from a fig tree when ·the wind blows [ L shaken by a strong wind/gale ] .
EXB	Revelation	6	14	The sky ·disappeared [ vanished ] as a scroll when it is rolled up [ Is . 34:4 ] , and every mountain and island was moved from its place .
EXB	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth , the ·rulers [ princes ; nobles ; magnates ] , the generals , the rich people , the powerful people , ·the slaves , and the free people [ L and everyone , both slave and free ; C people of every status and economic level ] hid themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains .
EXB	Revelation	6	16	They called to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us . Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne and from the ·anger [ wrath ] of the Lamb !
EXB	Revelation	6	17	[ L Because ] The great day for their ·anger [ wrath ] has come [ C the final judgment ] , and who can stand against it [ C a rhetorical question ] ? ”
EXB	Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand , from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand , from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand ,
EXB	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the ·east [ L rising of the sun ] who had the seal [ 5:1 ] of the living God . And he ·called out [ cried out ; shouted ] in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given power to ·harm [ damage ] the earth and the sea .
EXB	Revelation	7	3	He said to them , “ Do not ·harm [ damage ] the land or the sea or the trees until we ·mark with a sign [ place a seal upon ] the foreheads [ C to spare them from harm ; Ezek . 9:4–6 ] of the ·people who serve [ L the slaves/servants of ] our God. ”
EXB	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard how many people were ·marked with the sign [ sealed ] . There were one hundred forty-four thousand [ C the square of
EXB	Revelation	7	12	saying , “ Amen [ C Hebrew for “ so be it ” ] ! ·Praise [ Blessing ] , glory , wisdom , thanks , honor , power , and ·strength [ might ] belong to our God forever and ever . Amen ! ”
EXB	Revelation	7	1000	; a symbolic number indicating completeness ] from every tribe of the ·people [ children ; sons ] of Israel .
EXB	Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were ·marked with the sign [ sealed ] , from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand , from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand ,
EXB	Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand , from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand , from the tribe of Manasseh [ C one of the two sons of Joseph ; he replaces Dan in the list , perhaps because the tribe of Dan fell into idolatry ; Judg .
EXB	Revelation	7	18	] twelve thousand ,
EXB	Revelation	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand , from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand [ C in OT lists Manasseh and Ephraim are named instead of their father Joseph ; here Joseph replaces Ephraim , perhaps because of Ephraim ’ s bad reputation ] , and from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were ·marked with the sign [ sealed ] . The Great Crowd Worships God
EXB	Revelation	7	9	After ·the vision of these things [ L these things ] I looked , and ·there was a great number of people [ L behold a great crowd/multitude ] , so many that no one could count them . They were from every nation , tribe , people , and language of the earth . They were all standing before the throne and before the Lamb , wearing white robes [ C signifying high status and purity ] and holding palm branches [ C used to celebrate a festive occasion , specifically a victory ] in their hands .
EXB	Revelation	7	10	] . He will ·lead [ guide ] them to springs of ·water that give life [ living water ; the water of life ; John 4:14 ] . And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes [ 21:4 ; Is . 25:8 ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	7	11	[ L And ] All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders [ 4:4 ] and the four living creatures . They all ·bowed [ fell ] down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God ,
EXB	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people dressed in white robes ? Where did they come from ? ”
EXB	Revelation	7	14	I answered , “ You know , ·sir [ or my lord ] . ” And the elder said to me , “ These are the people who have come out of the great ·distress [ persecution ; tribulation ] . They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb [ C having believed in Jesus , their sins are forgiven through Christ ’ s death and resurrection ] .
EXB	Revelation	7	15	Because of this , they are before the throne of God . They worship him day and night in his temple . And the One who sits on the throne will ·be present with [ dwell with ; or shelter ; spread his tent over ] them .
EXB	Revelation	7	16	Those people will never be hungry again , and they will never be thirsty again . The sun will not ·hurt [ strike ; beat on ; Is . 49:10 ] them , and no [ scorching ] heat will burn them ,
EXB	Revelation	7	17	because the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd [ Ps .
EXB	Revelation	7	23	; John
EXB	Revelation	8	8	Then the second angel blew his trumpet , and something that looked like a ·big [ great ] mountain , burning with fire , was thrown into the sea [ C perhaps referring to a volcano or a flaming meteorite ; Jer . 51:25 ] . And a third of the sea became blood [ C echoes the first plague against Egypt ; Ex . 7:14–21 ] ,
EXB	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to whom were given seven trumpets [ C trumpets often announce God ’ s appearance , accompanied by judgment and victory ; Josh .
EXB	Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them [ 8:2 ] .
EXB	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar , holding a golden ·pan for incense [ censer ; incense burner ] . He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all ·God ’ s holy people [ T the saints ; Ps . 141:2 ] . The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne .
EXB	Revelation	8	4	The smoke from the incense went up from the angel ’ s hand ·to [ in the presence of ] God with the prayers of ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] .
EXB	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel filled the ·incense pan [ censer ; incense burner ] with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth , and there ·were thunder and loud noises [ was rumbling thunder ] , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake [ 4:5 ] .
EXB	Revelation	8	7	The first angel blew his trumpet , and hail and fire mixed with blood were ·poured [ thrown ; hurled ] down on the earth [ C similar to the seventh plague against Egypt ; Ex . 9:13–35 ; Joel 2:30–31 ] . And a third of the earth [ L was burned up ] , and a third of the trees [ L was burned up ] , and all the green grass were burned up . The Seven Angels and Trumpets
EXB	Revelation	8	9	a third of the living ·things [ creatures ] in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
EXB	Revelation	8	10	Then the third angel blew his trumpet , and a ·large [ great ] star , burning like a torch , fell from ·the sky [ or heaven ; C perhaps a meteorite ] . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
EXB	Revelation	8	11	[ L And ] The name of the star is Wormwood [ C a plant with a greenish , bitter oil ; a symbol of bitter sorrow ; Prov . 5:4 ; Jer . 9:15 ; 23:15 ] . And a third of all the water became ·bitter [ L wormwood ; C again an allusion to the first Egyptian plague ] , and many people died from ·drinking the water [ L the water ] that ·was [ became ; was made ] bitter .
EXB	Revelation	8	12	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet , and a third of the sun , and a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck . So a third of them became dark , and a third of the day was ·without light [ kept from shining ] , and also the night [ C echoing the ninth Egyptian plague ; Ex . 10:21–23 ] .
EXB	Revelation	8	13	While I watched , I heard an ·eagle [ or vulture ] that was flying ·high in the air [ L in mid-heaven ] cry out in a loud voice , “ ·Trouble ! Trouble ! Trouble [ L Woe ! Woe ! Woe ; C reminiscent of OT funeral laments , signifying their doom ; Nah . 3:1 ] for those who live on the earth because of the remaining ·sounds [ blasts ] of the trumpets that the other three angels are about to blow ! ”
EXB	Revelation	9	9	Their chests looked like iron breastplates , and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots ·hurrying [ charging ; running ] into battle [ Joel 2:5 ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	2	Then ·it [ or he ] opened up the ·hole that leads to the bottomless pit [ shaft of the Abyss ] , and smoke came up from the ·hole [ shaft ] like smoke from a ·big [ great ; giant ] furnace . Then the sun and ·sky [ air ] became dark because of the smoke from the ·hole [ shaft ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	3	Then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke [ C similar to the eighth Egyptian plague ; Ex . 10:1–20 ; see also Joel 1:2—2:10 ] , and they were given the power ·to sting like [ L like the power of ] scorpions [ L of the earth ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to ·harm [ damage ] the grass on the earth or any ·plant [ greenery ] or tree . They could ·harm [ damage ] only the people who did not have the ·sign [ seal ] of God on their foreheads [ 7:3 ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	5	These locusts were not ·given the power [ permitted ] to kill anyone , but to ·cause pain to [ torture ; torment ] the people for five months [ C perhaps referring to the limited life span of a locust ] . And ·the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives [ L their torture/torment was like the torture/torment of a scorpion ] when it stings someone .
EXB	Revelation	9	6	During those days people will ·look for a way to die [ L seek death ] , but they will not find it . They will ·want [ long ; desire ] to die , but death will ·run away [ flee ] from them .
EXB	Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses ·prepared [ equipped ; trained ] for battle [ Joel 2:4 ] . On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold [ C indicating their victory ; 2:10 ] , and their faces looked like human faces .
EXB	Revelation	9	8	Their hair was like women ’ s hair , and their teeth were like lions ’ teeth [ Joel 1:6 ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	10	The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions , and in their tails was their ·power [ authority ] to ·hurt [ damage ; harm ] people for five months .
EXB	Revelation	9	11	The locusts had a king who was the ·angel [ or messenger ] of the ·bottomless pit [ L Abyss ; 9:1 ] . His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon and in the Greek language is Apollyon [ C both mean “ Destroyer ” ; perhaps a reference to Satan ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	12	The first ·trouble [ L woe ] is past ; there are still two other ·troubles [ L woes ] that will come [ 8:13 ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	13	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice coming from the horns [ C some ancient manuscripts specify that there are four horns ; protrusions on the four corners of the altar symbolizing God ’ s strength ] on the golden altar [ C the incense altar ; Ex . 30:1–10 ] that is before God .
EXB	Revelation	9	14	The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , “ ·Free [ Release ] the four angels who are ·tied [ bound ] at the great river Euphrates [ 7:1 ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	9	15	And they ·let loose [ released ] the four angels who had been ·kept ready [ prepared ] for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of ·all people on the earth [ L humanity ; mankind ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	16	I heard how many troops on horses were in their army—two hundred million .
EXB	Revelation	9	17	The horses and their riders I saw in the vision looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue [ L hyacinth-colored ] , and yellow like sulfur [ brimstone ] . The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions , with fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .
EXB	Revelation	9	18	A third of ·all the people on earth [ humanity ; mankind ] were killed by these three ·terrible disasters [ plagues ] coming out of the horses ’ mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .
EXB	Revelation	9	19	The horses ’ ·power [ authority ] was in their mouths and in their tails ; their tails were like snakes with heads [ 12:9 ; Gen. 3:1–7 ] , and with them they ·hurt [ damaged ; injured ; wounded ] people .
EXB	Revelation	9	20	The ·other [ rest of the ] people who were not killed by these ·terrible disasters [ plagues ] still did not ·change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands [ L repent from the works of their hands ] . They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood—things that can not see or hear or walk [ Ps . 115:4–7 ; 135:17 ; Jer . 10:1–16 ] .
EXB	Revelation	9	21	These people did not ·change their hearts and turn away from [ repent of ] murder or ·evil magic [ sorcery ] , from their ·sexual sins [ fornication ] or stealing .
EXB	Revelation	10	10	So I took the small scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . In my mouth it tasted sweet as honey , but after I ate it , it was ·sour [ bitter ] in my stomach .
EXB	Revelation	10	2	The angel was holding a small scroll open in his hand . He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .
EXB	Revelation	10	3	Then he ·shouted [ cried out ] loudly like the roaring of a lion [ Hos . 11:10 ; Amos 3:8 ] . And when he ·shouted [ cried out ] , the voices of seven thunders [ Ps .
EXB	Revelation	10	29	] spoke .
EXB	Revelation	10	4	When the seven thunders spoke , I ·started [ was about ] to write . But I heard a voice from heaven say , “ ·Keep hidden [ L Seal up ; Dan . 12:4 ] what the seven thunders said , and do not write them down. ”
EXB	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven [ C as when taking an oath ; Ex . 6:8 ; Deut . 32:40 ] ,
EXB	Revelation	10	6	and he ·made a promise [ swore an oath ] ·by the power of the One [ L by the One ] who lives forever and ever [ Dan . 12:7 ] . He is the One who ·made [ created ] the ·skies [ or heavens ] and all that is in them , the earth and all that is in it , and the sea and all that is in it [ Gen.
EXB	Revelation	10	1	Pet . 1:10–12 ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	10	7	[ L But ] In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God ’ s ·secret [ mystery ; hidden plan ] will be ·finished [ completed ] . This ·secret [ mystery ; hidden plan ] is ·the Good News God told [ or just as he announced ] to his servants , the prophets [ Amos 3:7 ;
EXB	Revelation	10	8	Then I heard the same voice from heaven again , saying to me : “ Go and take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land. ”
EXB	Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll . And he said to me , “ Take the scroll and eat it [ C a symbol of internalizing the word ] .

EXB	Revelation	17	12	“ The ten horns [ Dan . 7:7–8 , 20–25 ] you saw are ten kings who have not yet ·begun to rule [ received a kingdom ] , but they will receive ·power [ authority ] to rule with the beast for one hour [ C a short time ] .
EXB	Revelation	17	14	They will make war against the Lamb [ C Jesus ] , but the Lamb will ·defeat [ conquer ; be victorious over ] them , because he is Lord of lords and King of kings . ·He will defeat them with his called , chosen , and faithful followers [ or Those with him are called , chosen and faithful ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	17	9	“ You need a wise mind to understand this . The seven heads on the beast are seven ·mountains [ or hills ; C Rome was built on seven hills ] where the woman sits .
EXB	Revelation	17	10	·And they are seven kings . Five of the kings have ·already been destroyed [ L fallen ] , one of the kings ·lives now [ L is ] , and another has not yet come . When he comes , he must stay a short time .
EXB	Revelation	17	11	The beast that ·was once alive [ L was ] , but ·is not alive now [ L is not ] , is also an eighth king . He belongs to the first seven kings , and he ·will go away to be destroyed [ is heading to destruction ] .
EXB	Revelation	17	13	All ten of these kings have ·the same [ L one ] ·purpose [ intention ] , and they will give their power and authority to the beast .
EXB	Revelation	17	15	Then the angel said to me , “ The waters that you saw , where the ·prostitute [ whore ] sits , are peoples , ·races [ multitudes ; crowds ] , nations , and languages .
EXB	Revelation	17	16	The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the ·prostitute [ whore ] . They will ·take everything she has [ make her desolate ] and leave her naked . They will eat her body and burn her with fire [ Ezek . 23:25–29 ] .
EXB	Revelation	17	18	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth. ” [ C Whether symbolized by Rome , Babylon , Sodom or apostate Jerusalem , this city is ultimately the human world system ruled by Satan standing in opposition to the city of God , the new Jerusalem . ]
EXB	Revelation	18	18	As they saw the smoke from her burning , they cried out loudly , “ ·There was never a city [ What city was… ? ] like this great city ! ”
EXB	Revelation	18	2	He ·shouted [ cried out ] in a ·powerful [ mighty ; strong ] voice : “ ·Ruined , ruined [ L Fallen , fallen ] is ·the great city of Babylon [ L Babylon the great ] ! She has become a ·home [ haunt ; dwelling place ] for demons and a ·prison [ or haunt ] for every ·evil [ L unclean ] spirit , and a ·prison [ or haunt ] for every unclean bird and unclean beast .
EXB	Revelation	18	3	She has ·been ruined [ fallen ] , because all the ·peoples [ nations ] of the earth have ·drunk [ some manuscripts read “ have fallen from ” ] the wine of the ·desire [ passion ] of her ·sexual sin [ promiscuity ; fornication ; 14:8 ; 17:2 ] . She has been ruined also because the kings of the earth have ·sinned sexually [ fornicated ] with her , and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the ·great wealth [ power ] of her ·luxury [ sensuality ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying : “ Come out of that city , my people , so that you will not share in her sins , so that you will not receive ·the disasters that will come to her [ L her plagues ; Gen. 19:15 ,
EXB	Revelation	18	17	All these riches have been ·destroyed [ made desolate ] in one hour [ C suddenly or in a short time ] ! ” Every sea captain , every passenger , the sailors , and all those who ·earn their living from [ trade ; work on ] the sea stood far away from Babylon .
EXB	Revelation	18	5	[ L Because ] Her sins have ·piled up [ heaped ; reached ] as high as ·the sky [ heaven ] , and God has ·not forgotten [ remembered ] ·the wrongs she has done [ her crimes ; her sins ] .
EXB	Revelation	18	6	·Give [ Pay back ] that city the same as she ·gave to [ paid ] others . Pay her back ·twice as much as [ double what ] she did . ·Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong as the wine she prepared for others [ L In the cup she mixed , mix double for her ; 14:8 ] .
EXB	Revelation	18	7	She gave herself much glory and ·rich living [ sensual luxury ] . Give her that much ·suffering [ torment ; torture ] and ·sadness [ grief ; mourning ] . She says ·to herself [ L in her heart ] , ‘ I am a queen sitting on my throne . I am not a widow ; I will never ·be sad [ know grief ; mourn ] . ’
EXB	Revelation	18	8	So these ·disasters [ plagues ] will come to her in one day : death , and ·crying [ sadness ; grief ; mourning ] , and ·great hunger [ famine ] , and she will be ·destroyed [ consumed ; burned up ] by fire , because the Lord God who judges her is ·powerful [ strong ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	18	9	The kings of the earth who ·sinned sexually [ fornicated ] with her and ·shared her wealth [ lived in luxury/sensuality with her ] will see the smoke from her burning . Then they will ·cry [ weep ] and ·be sad [ mourn ] because of her death .
EXB	Revelation	18	10	They will be afraid of her ·suffering [ torment ; torture ] and stand far away and say : “ ·Terrible ! How terrible for you [ L Woe , woe ; 8:13 ] , great city , ·powerful [ strong ; mighty ] city of Babylon , because your ·punishment [ judgment ; doom ] has come ·in one hour [ suddenly ] ! ”
EXB	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth will ·cry [ weep ] and be sad about her , because now there is no one to buy their cargoes—
EXB	Revelation	18	12	cargoes of gold , silver , ·jewels [ precious stones ] , pearls , fine linen , purple cloth , silk , ·red [ scarlet ] cloth ; all kinds of citron wood and all kinds of things made from ivory , expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
EXB	Revelation	18	13	[ and cargoes of ] cinnamon , spice , incense , myrrh , frankincense , wine , olive oil , fine flour , wheat , cattle , sheep , horses , carriages [ wagons ] , ·slaves , and human lives [ L bodies and human souls ] .
EXB	Revelation	18	14	The merchants will say [ C implied by the context ] , “ Babylon , the ·good things [ L fruit ] you ·wanted [ desired ; longed for ] are gone from you . All your ·rich [ expensive ; luxurious ] and ·fancy [ glamorous ; L shining ] things have disappeared . You will never ·have [ find ] them again. ”
EXB	Revelation	18	15	The merchants [ L of these things ] who became rich ·from selling to her [ L from her ] will be afraid of her ·suffering [ torment ; torture ] and will stand far away . They will ·cry [ weep ] and ·be sad [ mourn ]
EXB	Revelation	18	16	and say : “ ·Terrible ! How terrible [ L Woe , woe ; 8:13 ] for the great city ! She was dressed in fine linen , purple and ·red [ scarlet ] cloth , and she was ·shining [ glittering ; adorned ] with gold , precious jewels , and pearls [ 17:4 ] !
EXB	Revelation	18	19	And they threw dust on their heads [ C a ritual of mourning ] and cried out , weeping and ·being sad [ mourning ] . They said : “ ·Terrible ! How terrible [ L Woe , woe ] for the great city ! [ L In which ] All the people who had ships on the sea became rich because of her wealth ! But she has been ·destroyed [ made desolate ] in one hour [ C suddenly or in a short time ] !
EXB	Revelation	18	20	·Be happy [ rejoice ] ·because of this [ L over her ] , heaven ! ·Be happy [ Rejoice ] , ·God ’ s holy people [ T saints ] and apostles and prophets ! [ L For ] God has ·punished [ judged ] her ·because of what she did to you [ or on your behalf ; or for the judgment/punishment she imposed on you ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	18	21	Then a ·powerful [ strong ; mighty ] angel picked up a large stone , like ·one used for grinding grain [ a millstone ] , and threw it into the sea [ Jer . 51:63–64 ] . He said : “ In the same way , the great city of Babylon will be thrown down [ with violence ] , and it will never be found again .
EXB	Revelation	18	22	The ·music [ L sound ] of ·people playing harps [ harpists ] and ·other instruments [ musicians ; singers ] , ·flutes [ flutists ] , and ·trumpets [ trumpeters ] , will never be heard in you again . No ·workman [ craftsman ] doing any ·job [ trade ] will ever be found in you again . The sound of ·grinding grain [ the millstone ] will never be heard in you again .
EXB	Revelation	18	23	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again , and the voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again . [ L For ; Because ] Your merchants were the world ’ s great people , and all the nations were ·tricked [ deceived ; led astray ] by your ·magic [ sorcery ] .
EXB	Revelation	18	24	·You are guilty of the death of the prophets and God ’ s holy people [ L In you was found the blood of the prophets and the saints ] and all who have been ·killed [ slaughtered ; slain ] on earth . ”
EXB	Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth . Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse [ C Jesus ] and his army .
EXB	Revelation	19	2	because his judgments are true and ·right [ just ] . He has ·punished [ judged ] the [ L great ] ·prostitute [ whore ] who ·made the earth evil [ corrupted the earth ] with her ·sexual sin [ fornication ] . He has ·paid her back for [ avenged ] the ·death [ L blood ] of his servants [ which she shed ; L by her hand ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	19	3	Again they said : “ Hallelujah [ see 19:1 ] ! She is burning [ C implied by the context ] , and her smoke will rise forever and ever. ”
EXB	Revelation	19	4	Then the twenty-four elders [ 4:4 ] and the four living creatures ·bowed [ fell ] down and worshiped God , who sits on the throne . They said : “ Amen [ C meaning , “ So be it ! ” ] , Hallelujah [ see 19:1 ] ! ”
EXB	Revelation	19	5	Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God , all ·you who serve him [ his servants/slaves ] and all you who ·honor [ L fear ; Prov . 1:7 ] him , both small and great ! ”
EXB	Revelation	19	6	Then I heard ·what sounded like a great many people [ L the voice/sound of a great crowd ] , like the noise of ·flooding water [ many waters ] , and like the noise of loud thunder . The people were saying : “ Hallelujah [ 19:1 ] ! [ L For ] Our Lord God , the ·Almighty [ All-powerful ] , ·rules [ reigns ] .
EXB	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and ·be happy [ exult ] and give ·God [ L him ] ·glory [ honor ] , because the ·wedding [ marriage ] of the Lamb has come , and the Lamb ’ s bride has made herself ready .
EXB	Revelation	19	8	Fine linen , bright and ·clean [ pure ] , was given to her to wear. ” ( The fine linen ·means [ is ; stands for ] the ·good things done by God ’ s holy people [ L righteousness/righteous deeds of the saints/holy ones ] . )
EXB	Revelation	19	9	And the angel said to me , “ Write this : ·Blessed [ Happy ] are those who have been invited to the wedding ·meal [ supper ; banquet ] of the Lamb ! ” And the angel said [ L to me ] , “ These are the true words of God. ”
EXB	Revelation	19	10	Then I ·bowed down [ fell ] at the angel ’ s feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ ·Do not worship me [ Don ’ t do that ! ; L See , not ] ! I am a ·servant like you [ fellow servant with you ] and your brothers and sisters who have the ·message [ witness ; testimony ] of Jesus . Worship God , because the ·message [ witness ; testimony ] ·about [ or from ] Jesus ·is the spirit that gives all prophecy [ or is the essence of true prophecy ; or is Spirit-inspired prophecy ; L is the spirit/Spirit of prophecy ] . ” The Rider on the White Horse
EXB	Revelation	19	11	Then I saw heaven opened , and there before me was a white horse . The rider [ C Jesus ] on the horse is called Faithful and True , and ·he is right when [ with justice/righteousness ] he judges and makes war [ Ps . 96:13 ; 98:9 ] .
EXB	Revelation	19	12	His eyes are like ·burning [ blazing ; flames of ] fire [ Dan . 10:6 ] , and on his head are many ·crowns [ diadems ; royal crowns ; C contrast 12:3 ; 13:1 ] . He has a name written on him , which no one but himself knows .
EXB	Revelation	19	13	He is dressed in a ·robe [ garment ] dipped in blood [ C indicating judgment ; Is . 63:1–3 ] , and his name is the Word of God [ John 1:1 ] .
EXB	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven , dressed in fine linen , white and ·clean [ pure ] , were following him on white horses .
EXB	Revelation	19	15	Out of the rider ’ s mouth comes a sharp sword [ 1:16 ] that he will use to ·defeat [ strike down ] the nations [ Is . 11:4 ] , and he will ·rule [ or shepherd ] them with a ·rod [ staff ; scepter ] of iron [ Ps . 2:9 ] . He will ·crush out [ tread ; stomp ] the wine in the winepress of the ·terrible anger [ furious wrath ] of God the ·Almighty [ All-powerful ; 19:13 ; Is . 63:1–6 ] .
EXB	Revelation	19	16	On his robe and on his upper leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords [ 17:14 ; Deut . 10:17 ; Dan . 2:47 ] .
EXB	Revelation	19	17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and he called with a loud voice to all the birds flying in ·the sky [ L mid-heaven ] : “ Come and gather together for the great ·feast [ supper ; banquet ] of God
EXB	Revelation	19	18	so that you can eat the ·bodies [ flesh ] of kings , ·generals [ captains ; officers ] , mighty people , horses and their riders , and the bodies of all people—free , slave , small , and great [ 13:16 ; Ezek . 39:17–20 ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	19	20	But the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who ·did the miracles [ performed signs ] ·for the beast [ on his behalf ; in his presence ] . The false prophet had used these ·miracles [ signs ] to ·trick [ deceive ; lead astray ] those who had the ·mark [ brand ; stamp ] of the beast and worshiped his ·idol [ image ] . ·The false prophet and the beast [ L The two ] were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .
EXB	Revelation	19	21	And ·their armies [ L the rest ] were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds ·ate the bodies until they were full [ L were gorged/filled up with their flesh ] .
EXB	Revelation	20	20	I saw an angel coming down from heaven . He had the key to the ·bottomless pit [ Abyss ; 9:1 ] and a ·large [ great ] chain in his hand .
EXB	Revelation	20	2	Kin . 1:10 ,
EXB	Revelation	20	3	Then he threw him into the ·bottomless pit [ Abyss ] , ·closed [ or locked ] it , and ·locked it [ L sealed it ; or placed a seal on it ] over him . The angel did this so he could not ·trick [ deceive ; lead astray ] the ·people of the earth [ nations ] anymore until the thousand years were ·ended [ finished ; completed ] . After ·a thousand years [ L these things ] he must be set free for a short time .
EXB	Revelation	20	4	Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them who had been given the power to judge . And I saw the souls of those who had been ·killed [ L beheaded ] because ·they were faithful to the message [ of their testimony/witness ] of Jesus and [ L because of ] the ·message from [ word of ] God . They had not worshiped the beast or his ·idol [ image ] , and they had not received the ·mark [ brand ; stamp ] of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands . They came back to life and ·ruled [ reigned ] with Christ for a thousand years .
EXB	Revelation	20	5	( The others that were dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended . ) This is the first ·raising of the dead [ resurrection ] .
EXB	Revelation	20	6	·Blessed [ Happy ] and holy are those who ·share [ have a part ] in this first ·raising of the dead [ resurrection ] . The second death [ C being cast in the lake of fire ] has no ·power [ authority ] over them . They will be priests for God and for Christ and will ·rule [ reign ] with him for a thousand years .
EXB	Revelation	20	7	When the thousand years are over , Satan will be set free from his prison .
EXB	Revelation	20	8	Then he will go out to ·trick [ deceive ; lead astray ] the nations in ·all [ L the four corners of ] the earth—Gog and Magog—to gather them for battle [ Ezek . 38—39 ] . ·There are so many people [ L In number ] they will be like ·sand on the seashore [ or the sand of the sea ] .
EXB	Revelation	20	9	And ·Satan ’ s army [ L they ] marched across [ L the breadth of ; or the broad plain of ] the earth and ·gathered around [ surrounded ] the camp of ·God ’ s people [ T the saints ] and the city God loves . But fire came down from heaven and ·burned them up [ consumed/devoured them ; 13:13 ;
EXB	Revelation	20	1	Kin . 18:38 ;
EXB	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne . Then ·books [ scrolls ] were opened , and [ L another book/scroll , which is ] the ·book [ scroll ] of life was opened [ 3:5 ; Dan . 12:1–2 ] . The dead were judged by what they had done , which was ·written [ recorded ] in the ·books [ scrolls ] .
EXB	Revelation	20	10	And ·Satan [ L the Devil ] , who ·tricked them [ deceived them ; led them astray ] , was thrown into the lake of ·burning sulfur [ L fire and sulfur ] with the beast and the false prophet . There they will be ·punished [ tormented ; tortured ] day and night forever and ever . People of the World Are Judged
EXB	Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne and the One who was sitting on it . Earth and ·sky [ heaven ] ·ran away [ fled ] from ·him [ L his presence/face ] and ·disappeared [ L no place was found for them ] .
EXB	Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead who were in it , and Death and Hades [ C the realm of the dead , also known as Sheol ; 6:8 ] gave up the dead who were in them . Each person was judged by what he had done .
EXB	Revelation	20	14	And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire . The lake of fire is the second death .
EXB	Revelation	20	15	And anyone whose name was not found written in the book [ scroll ] of life was thrown into the lake of fire .
EXB	Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls , each gate having been made from a single pearl . And the ·street [ main street ; square ] of the city was made of pure gold as clear as glass .
EXB	Revelation	21	2	Sam . 7:14 ] .
EXB	Revelation	21	9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last ·troubles [ plagues ] came to me , saying , “ ·Come with me [ L Come ] , and I will show you the bride , the wife of the Lamb [ C the church ; Eph . 5:27–29 ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne , saying , “ [ L Look ; T Behold ] Now God ’ s ·presence [ dwelling ; tabernacle ] is with people , and he will ·live [ dwell ; tabernacle ; John 1:14 ] with them , and they will be his people [ Ex . 29:45 ; Jer . 31:33 ; Ezek . 37:27 ] . God himself will be with them and will be their God . [ a ]
EXB	Revelation	21	4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes [ 7:17 ; Is . 25:8 ] , and there will be no more death [ Is . 25:8 ;

EXB	Revelation	21	5	The One who was sitting on the throne [ C Jesus ] said , “ Look ! I am making everything new ! ” Then he said , “ Write this , because these words are ·true and can be trusted [ L faithful/reliable and true ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	21	6	The One on the throne said to me , “ It is ·finished [ done ; accomplished ] . I am the Alpha and the Omega [ C the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet ; 1:8 ] , the Beginning and the End . I will give ·free water [ L freely ] from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty [ Is . 55:1 ; John 7:37 ] .
EXB	Revelation	21	7	Those who ·win the victory [ conquer ] will ·receive [ inherit ] ·this [ L these things ; C God ’ s promise ] , and I will be their God , and they will be my children [ 21:3 ;
EXB	Revelation	21	8	But cowards , those ·who refuse to believe [ without faith ] , who do ·evil [ vile ; detestable ] things , who kill , who sin sexually , who do ·evil magic [ sorcery ] , who worship idols , and who tell lies—all these will have ·a place [ L their part ] in the lake of burning sulfur . This is the second death [ 20:6 ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	21	10	And the angel carried me away ·by the Spirit [ or in the spirit ] to a very large and high mountain . He showed me the holy city , Jerusalem , coming down out of heaven from God .
EXB	Revelation	21	11	It ·was shining with [ possessed ; L had ] the glory of God and was ·bright [ radiant ; brilliant ] like a ·very expensive jewel [ precious stone ] , like a jasper , clear as crystal .
EXB	Revelation	21	12	The city had a great high wall with twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates , and on each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel .
EXB	Revelation	21	13	There were three gates on the east , three on the north , three on the south , and three on the west [ Ezek . 48:30–35 ] .
EXB	Revelation	21	14	The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones , and on the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
EXB	Revelation	21	15	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold to measure the city , its gates , and its wall .
EXB	Revelation	21	16	The city ·was built in a square [ L lies foursquare ] , and its length was equal to its width . The angel measured the city with the rod . The city was ·1,500 miles long , 1,500 miles wide , and 1,500 miles high [ L 1,200 stadia—its length and width and height are equal ; C the unit of measure called a stadium was approximately
EXB	Revelation	21	600	feet ] .
EXB	Revelation	21	17	The angel also measured the wall . It was ·216 feet [ L
EXB	Revelation	21	144	cubits ] ·high [ or thick ; C the Greek is ambiguous ] , by human measurements , which the angel was using .
EXB	Revelation	21	18	The wall was made of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , as pure as glass .
EXB	Revelation	21	19	The foundation stones of the city walls were ·decorated [ ornamented ] with every kind of ·jewel [ precious stone ; Ex . 28:15–21 ; Is . 54:11–12 ] . The first foundation was jasper , the second was sapphire , the third was ·chalcedony [ agate ] , the fourth was emerald ,

EXB	Revelation	21	22	I did not see a temple in the city , because the Lord God ·Almighty [ All-powerful ] and the Lamb are the city ’ s temple [ C a temple representing the presence of God is not needed because God ’ s presence is throughout the city ] .
EXB	Revelation	21	23	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it , because the glory of God ·is its [ gives it ] light , and the Lamb is the city ’ s lamp [ Is . 60:19 ] .
EXB	Revelation	21	24	By its light the ·people of the world [ nations ] will walk , and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it [ Is . 60:1–3 ] .

Only those whose names are written in the Lamb ’ s ·book [ scroll ] of life [ 3:5 ] will enter the city . Footnotes - Revelation 21:3 and … God Some Greek copies do not have this phrase .
EXB	Revelation	22	22	Then the angel showed me the river of the ·water of life [ or living water ] . It was ·shining [ bright ; clear ] like crystal and was flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
EXB	Revelation	22	2	down the middle of the ·street [ main street ; square ] of the city [ Gen. 2:10 ; Ezek . 47:1–12 ] . The tree of life was on each side of the river [ Gen. 2:9 ; C heaven is like Eden , only better ] . It produces ·fruit twelve times a year , once each month [ or twelve kinds of fruit , producing fruit each month ] . The leaves of the tree are for the healing of all the nations .
EXB	Revelation	22	3	·Nothing that God judges guilty will be in that city [ Nothing accursed will be there ; or There will no longer be any curse ; Gen. 3:16–19 ; Zech . 14:11 ] . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there , and God ’ s servants will ·worship [ serve ] him .
EXB	Revelation	22	4	They will see his face , and his name will be written on their foreheads [ C denoting ownership ; 3:12 ; 7:3 ; contrast 13:16 ; Ex . 28:36–38 ] .

EXB	Revelation	22	7	“ ·Listen [ L Look ; T Behold ] ! I am coming ·soon [ quickly ] ! ·Blessed [ Happy ] is the one who obeys the words of prophecy in this ·book [ scroll ] . ”
EXB	Revelation	22	8	I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . When I heard and saw them , I ·bowed [ fell ] down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed these things to me .
EXB	Revelation	22	9	But the angel said to me , “ ·Do not worship me [ Don ’ t do that ! ; L See , not ] ! I am a ·servant like you [ fellow servant with you ] , your brothers the prophets , and all those who ·obey [ keep ] the words in this ·book [ scroll ] . Worship God ! ”
EXB	Revelation	22	10	Then the angel told me , “ Do not ·keep secret [ L seal ; contrast 10:4 ] the words of prophecy in this ·book [ scroll ] , because the time is near for all this to happen .
EXB	Revelation	22	11	Let whoever is doing ·evil [ wrong ; harm ] continue to do evil [ wrong ; harm ; Dan . 12:10 ] .
