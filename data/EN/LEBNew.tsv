LEB	Matthew	6	5	And whenever you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , because they love to stand and [ c ] pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets , in order that they may be seen by people . Truly I say to you , they have received their reward in full !
LEB	Matthew	6	7	“ But when you [ e ] pray , do not babble repetitiously like the pagans , for they think that because of their many words they will be heard .
LEB	Matthew	6	8	Therefore do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need [ f ] before you ask him .
LEB	Matthew	6	9	Therefore you pray in this way : “ Our Father who is in heaven , may your name be treated as holy .
LEB	Matthew	6	10	May your kingdom come , may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
LEB	Matthew	6	11	Give us today our daily bread ,
LEB	Matthew	6	12	and forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors .
LEB	Matthew	6	13	And do not bring us into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . [ g ]
LEB	Matthew	6	14	For if you forgive people their sins , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
LEB	Matthew	6	15	But if you do not forgive people , neither will your Father forgive your sins . The Sermon on the Mount : How to Fast
LEB	Matthew	6	16	“ Whenever you fast , do not be sullen like the hypocrites , for they make their faces unrecognizable in order that they may be seen fasting by people . Truly I say to you , they have received their reward in full !
LEB	Matthew	6	17	But when [ h ] you are fasting , put olive oil on your head [ i ] and wash your face
LEB	Matthew	6	18	so that you will not be seen by people as fasting , but to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you . The Sermon on the Mount : Treasure in Heaven
LEB	Matthew	6	19	“ Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and consuming insect [ j ] destroy and where thieves break in and steal ,
LEB	Matthew	6	20	but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor consuming insect [ k ] destroy and where thieves do not break in or steal .
LEB	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also .
LEB	Matthew	6	22	“ The eye is the lamp of the body . Therefore if your eye is sincere , your whole body will be full of light .
LEB	Matthew	6	23	But if your eye is evil , your whole body will be dark . Therefore if the light in you is darkness , how great is the darkness !
LEB	Matthew	6	24	“ No one is able to serve two masters . For either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to one and despise the other . You are not able to serve God and money . [ l ] The Sermon on the Mount : Anxiety
LEB	Matthew	6	25	“ For this reason I say to you , do not be anxious for your life , what you will eat , [ m ] and not for your body , what you will wear . Is your life not more than food and your body more than clothing ?
LEB	Matthew	6	26	Consider the birds of the sky , that they do not sow or reap or gather produce into barns , and your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not worth more than they are ?
LEB	Matthew	6	27	And who among you , by [ n ] being anxious , is able to add one hour [ o ] to his life span ?
LEB	Matthew	6	28	And why are you anxious about clothing ? Observe the lilies of the field , how they grow : they do not toil or spin ,
LEB	Matthew	6	29	but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these .
LEB	Matthew	6	30	But if God dresses the grass of the field in this way , although it [ p ] is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , will he not do so much more for you , you of little faith ?
LEB	Matthew	6	31	Therefore do not be anxious , saying , ‘ What will we eat ? ’ or ‘ What will we drink ? ’ or ‘ What will we wear ? , ’
LEB	Matthew	6	32	for the pagans seek after all these things . For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things .
LEB	Matthew	6	33	But seek first his kingdom and righteousness , [ q ] and all these things will be added to you .
LEB	Matthew	6	34	Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow , because tomorrow will be anxious for itself . Each day has enough trouble of its own .

LEB	Matthew	7	7	“ Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and it will be opened for you .
LEB	Matthew	7	2	For by what judgment you judge , you will be judged , and by what measure you measure out , it will be measured out to you .
LEB	Matthew	7	3	And why do you see the speck that is in your brother ’ s eye , but do not notice the beam of wood in your own eye ?
LEB	Matthew	7	4	Or how will you say to your brother , ‘ Allow me to remove the speck from your eye , ’ and behold , the beam of wood is in your own eye ?
LEB	Matthew	7	5	Hypocrite ! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother ’ s eye !
LEB	Matthew	7	6	“ Do not give what is holy to dogs , or throw your pearls in front of pigs , lest they trample them with their feet , and turn around and [ a ] tear you to pieces . The Sermon on the Mount : Ask , Seek , Knock
LEB	Matthew	7	8	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it will be opened .

LEB	Matthew	7	10	Or also if he will ask for a fish , will give him a snake ?
LEB	Matthew	7	11	Therefore if you , although you [ b ] are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him ?
LEB	Matthew	7	12	Therefore in all things , whatever you want that people should do to you , thus also you do to them . For this is the law and the prophets . The Sermon on the Mount : The Narrow Gate
LEB	Matthew	7	13	“ Enter through the narrow gate , because broad is the gate and spacious is the road that leads to destruction , and there are many who enter through it ,
LEB	Matthew	7	14	because narrow [ c ] is the gate and constricted is the road that leads to life , and there are few who find it ! The Sermon on the Mount : Recognizing False Prophets
LEB	Matthew	7	15	“ Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep ’ s clothing , but inside are ravenous wolves .
LEB	Matthew	7	16	You will recognize them by their fruits : they do not gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles , do they ? [ d ]
LEB	Matthew	7	17	In the same way , every good tree produces good fruit , but a bad tree produces bad fruit .
LEB	Matthew	7	18	A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit , nor a bad tree to produce good fruit .
LEB	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
LEB	Matthew	7	20	As a result , you will recognize them by their fruits . The Sermon on the Mount : False Followers
LEB	Matthew	7	21	“ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven , but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .

LEB	Matthew	8	10	Now when [ i ] Jesus heard this , [ j ] he was astonished , and said to those who were following him , [ k ] “ Truly I say to you , I have found such great faith with no one in Israel .
LEB	Matthew	8	11	But I say to you that many will come from east and west and be seated at the banquet [ l ] with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven .

LEB	Matthew	10	9	Do not procure gold or silver or copper for your belts .
LEB	Matthew	10	11	And into whatever town or village you enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and stay there until you depart .
LEB	Matthew	10	12	And when you [ g ] enter into the house , greet it .
LEB	Matthew	10	13	And if the house is worthy , let your peace come upon it , but if it is not worthy , let your peace return to you .
LEB	Matthew	10	14	And whoever does not welcome you or listen to your words , shake off the dust from your feet as you [ h ] are going out of that house or that [ i ] town .
LEB	Matthew	10	15	Truly I say to you , it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town ! Persecution of Disciples Predicted
LEB	Matthew	10	16	“ Behold , I am sending you out like sheep in the midst of wolves . Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves .
LEB	Matthew	10	17	But beware of people , because they will hand you over to councils , and they will flog you in their synagogues .
LEB	Matthew	10	18	And you will be brought before both governors and kings because of me , for a witness to them and to the Gentiles .
LEB	Matthew	10	19	But whenever they hand you over , do not be anxious how to speak [ j ] or what you should say , for what you should say will be given to you at that hour .
LEB	Matthew	10	20	For you are not the ones who are speaking , but the Spirit of your Father who is speaking through you .
LEB	Matthew	10	21	“ And brother will hand over brother to death , and a father his children , and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death ,
LEB	Matthew	10	22	and you will be hated by everyone because of my name . But the one who endures to the end—this one will be saved .
LEB	Matthew	10	23	And whenever they persecute you in this town , flee to another , for truly I say to you , you will never finish going through the towns of Israel until the Son of Man comes .
LEB	Matthew	10	24	“ A disciple is not superior to his teacher , nor a slave superior to his master .
LEB	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher , and the slave like his master . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul , how much more the members of his household ? Fear God Rather Than People
LEB	Matthew	10	26	“ Therefore do not be afraid of them , because nothing is hidden that will not be revealed , and nothing secret that will not become known .
LEB	Matthew	10	27	What I say to you in the dark , tell in the light , and what you hear in your ear , proclaim on the housetops .
LEB	Matthew	10	28	And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul , but instead be afraid of the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .

LEB	Matthew	10	34	“ Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth ! I have not come to bring peace , but a sword .
LEB	Matthew	10	35	For I have come to turn a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law .

LEB	Matthew	11	11	Truly I say to you , among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist . But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
LEB	Matthew	11	2	Now when [ a ] John [ b ] heard in prison the deeds of Christ , he sent word [ c ] by his disciples
LEB	Matthew	11	3	and [ d ] said to him , “ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ”
LEB	Matthew	11	4	And Jesus answered and [ e ] said to them , “ Go and [ f ] tell John what you hear and see :
LEB	Matthew	11	5	the blind receive sight and the lame walk , lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear , and the dead are raised , and the poor have good news announced to them . [ g ]
LEB	Matthew	11	6	And whoever is not offended by me is blessed. ”
LEB	Matthew	11	7	Now as [ h ] these were going away , Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
LEB	Matthew	11	8	But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings .
LEB	Matthew	11	9	But why did you go out ? To see a prophet ? [ i ] Yes , I tell you , and even more than a prophet !
LEB	Matthew	11	10	It is this man about whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I am sending my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you. ’ [ j ]
LEB	Matthew	11	12	But from the days of John the Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven is treated violently , and the violent claim [ k ] it .
LEB	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John ,
LEB	Matthew	11	14	and if you are willing to accept it , [ l ] he is Elijah , the one who is going to come .
LEB	Matthew	11	15	The one who has ears , let him hear !
LEB	Matthew	11	16	“ But to what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another ,
LEB	Matthew	11	17	saying , ‘ We played the flute for you and you did not dance ; we sang a lament and you did not mourn. ’
LEB	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
LEB	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Behold , a man who is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds. ” [ m ] Woes Pronounced on Unrepentant Towns
LEB	Matthew	11	20	Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done , because they did not repent :
LEB	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
LEB	Matthew	11	22	Nevertheless I tell you , it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you !
LEB	Matthew	11	23	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? No , you will be brought down to Hades ! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until today .
LEB	Matthew	11	24	Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you ! ” A Yoke That Is Easy
LEB	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus answered and [ n ] said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent , and have revealed them to young children . [ o ]
LEB	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , for to do so was your gracious will . [ p ]
LEB	Matthew	11	27	All things have been handed over to me by my Father , and no one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom [ q ] the Son wants to reveal him . [ r ]
LEB	Matthew	11	28	Come to me , all of you who labor and are burdened , and I will give you rest .
LEB	Matthew	11	29	Take my yoke on you and learn from me , for I am gentle and humble in heart , and you will find rest for your souls .

LEB	Matthew	12	12	Then to what degree is a man worth more than a sheep ? So then , it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath. ”
LEB	Matthew	12	2	But when [ b ] the Pharisees saw it , [ c ] they said to him , “ Behold , your disciples are doing what it is not permitted to do on the Sabbath ! ”
LEB	Matthew	12	3	So he said to them , “ Have you not read what David did when he was hungry , and those with him ,
LEB	Matthew	12	4	how he entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the presentation , which it was not permitted for him or for those with him to eat , but only for the priests ?
LEB	Matthew	12	5	Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath and are guiltless ?
LEB	Matthew	12	6	But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here !
LEB	Matthew	12	7	And if you had known what it means , [ d ] ‘ I want mercy and not sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned the guiltless .
LEB	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath. ” A Man with a Withered Hand Healed
LEB	Matthew	12	9	And going on from there he came into their synagogue .
LEB	Matthew	12	10	And behold , there was a man who had a withered hand , and they asked him , saying , “ Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath ? ” in order that they could accuse him .
LEB	Matthew	12	11	But he said to them , “ What man will there be among you who will have one sheep and if this one fell into a pit on the Sabbath , will not take hold of it and lift it [ e ] out ?
LEB	Matthew	12	13	Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand , ” and he stretched it [ f ] out , and it was restored as healthy as the other one .
LEB	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted [ g ] against him in order that they could destroy him . God ’ s Chosen Servant
LEB	Matthew	12	15	Now Jesus , when he [ h ] learned of it , [ i ] withdrew from there , and many [ j ] followed him , and he healed them all .
LEB	Matthew	12	16	And he warned them that they should not reveal his identity , [ k ]
LEB	Matthew	12	17	in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled , who said ,
LEB	Matthew	12	18	“ Behold my servant whom I have chosen , my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased . I will put my Spirit on him , and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
LEB	Matthew	12	19	He will not quarrel or cry out , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets .
LEB	Matthew	12	20	A crushed reed he will not break , and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish , until he brings justice to victory .
LEB	Matthew	12	21	And in his name the Gentiles [ l ] will hope . [ m ] A House Divided Can not Stand
LEB	Matthew	12	22	Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him . And he healed him so that the man who was mute could speak and see .
LEB	Matthew	12	23	And all the crowds were amazed and began saying , “ Perhaps this one is the Son of David ! ”
LEB	Matthew	12	24	But the Pharisees , when they [ n ] heard it , [ o ] said , “ This man does not expel demons except by Beelzebul the ruler of demons ! ”
LEB	Matthew	12	25	But knowing their thoughts , he said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and every city or household divided against itself will not stand .
LEB	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan expels Satan , he is divided against himself . How then will his kingdom stand ?
LEB	Matthew	12	27	And if I expel demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons expel them ? [ p ] For this reason they will be your judges !
LEB	Matthew	12	28	But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you !
LEB	Matthew	12	29	Or how can someone enter into the house of a strong man and steal his property , unless he first ties up the strong man ? And then he can thoroughly plunder his house .
LEB	Matthew	12	30	The one who is not with me is against me , and the one who does not gather with me scatters .
LEB	Matthew	12	31	For this reason I tell you , every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people , but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven !
LEB	Matthew	12	32	And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him . But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him either in this age or in the coming one ! Good Trees and Good Fruit or Bad Trees and Bad Fruit
LEB	Matthew	12	33	“ Either make the tree good and its fruit is good , or make the tree bad and its fruit is bad , for the tree is known by its fruit .
LEB	Matthew	12	34	Offspring of vipers ! How are you able to say good things when you [ q ] are evil ? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks .
LEB	Matthew	12	35	The good person from his [ r ] good treasury brings out good things , and the evil person from his [ s ] evil treasury brings out evil things .
LEB	Matthew	12	36	But I tell you that every worthless word that they speak , people will give an account for it on the day of judgment !
LEB	Matthew	12	37	For by your words you will be vindicated , and by your words you will be condemned. ” The Sign of Jonah
LEB	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying , “ Teacher , we want to see a sign from you ! ”
LEB	Matthew	12	39	But he answered and [ t ] said to them , “ An evil and adulterous generation desires a sign , and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah !
LEB	Matthew	12	40	For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights , so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights .
LEB	Matthew	12	41	The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah , and behold , something [ u ] greater than Jonah is here !
LEB	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , something [ v ] greater than Solomon is here ! An Unclean Spirit Returns
LEB	Matthew	12	43	“ Now whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it travels through waterless places searching for rest , and does not find it . [ w ]
LEB	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my house from which I came out. ’ And when it [ x ] arrives it finds the house [ y ] unoccupied and swept and put in order .
LEB	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and brings along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and [ z ] live there . And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first . So it will be for this evil generation also ! ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers
LEB	Matthew	12	46	And [ aa ] while [ ab ] he was still speaking to the crowds , behold , his mother and brothers were standing there outside , desiring to speak to him .
LEB	Matthew	12	47	And someone told him , “ Behold , your mother and your brothers are standing there outside desiring to speak to you. ”
LEB	Matthew	12	48	But he answered and [ ac ] said to the one who told him , “ Who is my mother , and who are my brothers ? ”
LEB	Matthew	12	49	And stretching out his hand toward his disciples , he said , “ Behold my mother and my brothers !

LEB	Matthew	13	13	For this reason I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor do they understand ,
LEB	Matthew	13	2	And large crowds gathered close around him , so that he got into a boat to sit down , and all the crowd was standing on the shore .
LEB	Matthew	13	3	And he spoke many things to them in parables , saying , “ Behold , the sower went out to sow ,
LEB	Matthew	13	4	and while he was sowing , some seed [ c ] fell on the side of the path , and the birds came and [ d ] devoured it .
LEB	Matthew	13	5	And other seed fell on the rocky ground , where it did not have much soil , and it sprang up at once because it did not have any depth of soil .
LEB	Matthew	13	6	But when [ e ] the sun rose it was scorched , and because it did not have enough root , it withered .
LEB	Matthew	13	7	And other seed fell among the thorn plants , and the thorn plants came up and choked it .
LEB	Matthew	13	8	But other seed fell on the good soil and produced grain , [ f ] this one a hundred times as much and this one sixty and this one thirty .
LEB	Matthew	13	9	The one who has ears , let him hear ! ” The Reason for the Parables
LEB	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came up and [ g ] said to him , “ Why [ h ] do you speak to them in parables ? ”
LEB	Matthew	13	11	And he answered and [ i ] said to them , “ To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to those people it has not been granted .
LEB	Matthew	13	12	For whoever has , to him more will be given , and he will have an abundance . But whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
LEB	Matthew	13	14	and with reference to them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says , “ You will listen carefully [ j ] and will never understand , and you will look closely [ k ] and will never perceive .
LEB	Matthew	13	15	For the heart of this people has become dull , and with their ears they hear with difficulty , and they have shut their eyes , so that they would not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn , and I would heal them. ” [ l ]
LEB	Matthew	13	16	But your eyes are blessed because they see , and your ears because they hear .
LEB	Matthew	13	17	For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see , and did not see it , [ m ] and to hear what you hear , and did not hear it ! [ n ] The Parable of the Sower Interpreted
LEB	Matthew	13	18	“ You , therefore , listen to the parable of the sower :
LEB	Matthew	13	19	When [ o ] anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it , [ p ] the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart . This is what was sown on the side of the path .
LEB	Matthew	13	20	And what was sown on the rocky ground—this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy .
LEB	Matthew	13	21	But he does not have a root in himself , but lasts only a little while , [ q ] and when [ r ] affliction or persecution happens because of the word , immediately he falls away .
LEB	Matthew	13	22	And what was sown into the thorn plants—this is the one who hears the word , and the anxiety of this world [ s ] and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word and it becomes unproductive .
LEB	Matthew	13	23	But what was sown on the good soil—this is the one who hears the word and understands it , [ t ] who indeed bears fruit and produces , this one a hundred times as much , and this one sixty , and this one thirty. ” The Parable of the Weeds Among the Wheat
LEB	Matthew	13	24	He put before them another parable , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field .
LEB	Matthew	13	25	But while his [ u ] people were sleeping , his enemy came and sowed darnel [ v ] in the midst of the wheat and went away .
LEB	Matthew	13	26	So when the wheat [ w ] sprouted and yielded grain , then the darnel appeared also .
LEB	Matthew	13	27	So the slaves of the master of the house came and [ x ] said to him , ‘ Master , did you not sow good seed in your field ? How then does it have darnel ? ’
LEB	Matthew	13	28	And he said to them , ‘ An enemy has done this ! ’ So the slaves said to him , ‘ Then do you want us to go and [ y ] gather them ? ’
LEB	Matthew	13	29	But he said , “ No , lest when you [ z ] gather the darnel you uproot the wheat together with it .
LEB	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest , and at the season of the harvest I will tell the reapers , “ First gather the darnel and tie it into bundles to burn them , but gather the wheat into my storehouse. ” ’ ” The Parable of the Mustard Seed
LEB	Matthew	13	31	He put before them another parable , saying , “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and [ aa ] sowed in his field .
LEB	Matthew	13	32	It [ ab ] is the smallest of all the seeds , but when it is grown it is larger than the garden herbs and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches. ” The Parable of the Yeast
LEB	Matthew	13	33	He told them another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and [ ac ] put into three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened. ” Parables Fulfill Prophecy
LEB	Matthew	13	34	Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables , and he was saying nothing to them without a parable ,
LEB	Matthew	13	35	in order that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled , who said , “ I will open my mouth in parables ; I will proclaim what has been hidden since the creation. ” [ ad ] [ ae ] The Parable of the Weeds Interpreted
LEB	Matthew	13	36	Then he left the crowds and [ af ] came into the house , and his disciples came to him saying , “ Explain the parable of the darnel in the field to us. ”
LEB	Matthew	13	37	So he answered and [ ag ] said , “ The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man ,
LEB	Matthew	13	38	and the field is the world . And the good seed—these are the sons of the kingdom , but the darnel are the sons of the evil one .
LEB	Matthew	13	39	And the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is the end of the age , and the reapers are angels .

LEB	Matthew	14	2	and he said to his servants , “ This is John the Baptist ! He has been raised from the dead , and for this reason miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
LEB	Matthew	14	3	For Herod , after [ a ] arresting John , bound him and put him [ b ] in prison on account of Herodias , the wife of his brother Philip ,
LEB	Matthew	14	4	because John had been saying to him , “ It is not permitted for you to have her. ”
LEB	Matthew	14	5	And although he [ c ] wanted to kill him , he feared the crowd , because they looked upon him as a prophet .
LEB	Matthew	14	6	But when [ d ] Herod ’ s birthday celebration took place , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst of them and pleased Herod .
LEB	Matthew	14	7	Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked .
LEB	Matthew	14	8	And coached by her mother , she said , “ Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter ! ”
LEB	Matthew	14	9	And although [ e ] the king was distressed , because of his oaths and his dinner guests [ f ] he commanded the request [ g ] to be granted .
LEB	Matthew	14	10	And he sent orders [ h ] and [ i ] had John beheaded in the prison ,
LEB	Matthew	14	11	and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl , and she brought it [ j ] to her mother .
LEB	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came and [ k ] took away the corpse and buried it , and went and [ l ] told Jesus . The Feeding of Five Thousand

LEB	Matthew	14	15	Now when it [ r ] was evening , the disciples came to him saying , “ The place is desolate and the hour is late . [ s ] Release the crowds so that they can go away into the villages and [ t ] purchase food for themselves. ”
LEB	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said to them , “ They do not need [ u ] to go away . You give them something [ v ] to eat. ”
LEB	Matthew	14	17	And they said to him , “ We do not have anything [ w ] here except five loaves and two fish. ”
LEB	Matthew	14	18	So he said , “ Bring them here to me. ”
LEB	Matthew	14	19	And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass . Taking the five loaves and the two fish and [ x ] looking up to heaven , he gave thanks . And after [ y ] breaking them , [ z ] he gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples gave them [ aa ] to the crowds .

LEB	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea .
LEB	Matthew	14	26	But the disciples , when they [ ad ] saw him walking on the sea , were terrified , saying , “ It is a ghost ! ” and they cried out in fear .

LEB	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered him and [ ae ] said , “ Lord , if it is you , [ af ] command me to come to you on the water ! ”
LEB	Matthew	14	29	So he said , “ Come ! ” And getting out of the boat , Peter walked on the water and came toward Jesus .
LEB	Matthew	14	30	But when he [ ag ] saw the strong wind , he was afraid . And beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , “ Lord , save me ! ”
LEB	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus extended his [ ah ] hand and [ ai ] caught him and said to him , “ You of little faith ! Why did you doubt ? ”
LEB	Matthew	14	32	And when [ aj ] they got into the boat , the wind abated .

LEB	Matthew	15	15	But Peter answered and [ r ] said to him , “ Explain this parable to us. ”
LEB	Matthew	15	2	“ Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? For they do not wash their hands when they eat a meal. ” [ a ]
LEB	Matthew	15	3	So he answered and [ b ] said to them , “ Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition ?
LEB	Matthew	15	4	For God said , ‘ Honor your [ c ] father and your [ d ] mother , ’ [ e ] and ‘ The one who speaks evil of father or mother must certainly die [ f ] . ’ [ g ]
LEB	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ Whoever says to his [ h ] father or his [ i ] mother , “ Whatever benefit you would have received [ j ] from me is a gift to God , ”
LEB	Matthew	15	6	need not honor his father , ’ [ k ] and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition .

LEB	Matthew	15	10	And summoning the crowd , he said to them , “ Hear and understand :
LEB	Matthew	15	11	It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person , but what comes out of the mouth—this defiles a person. ”
LEB	Matthew	15	12	Then the disciples came and [ n ] said to him , “ Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they [ o ] heard this saying ? ”
LEB	Matthew	15	13	And he answered and [ p ] said , “ Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted .
LEB	Matthew	15	14	Let [ q ] them ! They are blind guides of the blind . And if the blind guide the blind , both will fall into a pit. ”
LEB	Matthew	15	16	But he said , “ Are you also still without understanding ?
LEB	Matthew	15	17	Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine ?
LEB	Matthew	15	18	But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart , and these defile the person .

LEB	Matthew	15	21	And departing from there , Jesus went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
LEB	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out , saying , “ Have mercy on me , Lord , Son of David ! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon ! ”
LEB	Matthew	15	23	But he did not answer her a word . And his disciples came up and [ s ] asked him , saying , “ Send her away , because she is crying out after us ! ”
LEB	Matthew	15	24	But he answered and [ t ] said , “ I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”

LEB	Matthew	15	33	And the disciples said to him , “ Where in this desolate place can we get [ ab ] so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied ? ”
LEB	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” So they said , “ Seven , and a few little fish. ”

LEB	Matthew	16	16	And Simon Peter answered and [ q ] said , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God ! ”
LEB	Matthew	16	2	So he answered and [ c ] said to them , “ When [ d ] evening comes you say , ‘ It will be fair weather because the sky is red , ’
LEB	Matthew	16	3	and early in the morning , ‘ Today it will be stormy weather , because the sky is red and [ e ] darkening. ’ You know how to evaluate correctly the appearance of the sky , but you are not able to evaluate [ f ] the signs of the times .
LEB	Matthew	16	4	An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign , and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah ! ” And he left them and [ g ] went away . Beware the Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
LEB	Matthew	16	5	And when [ h ] the disciples arrived at the other side , [ i ] they had forgotten to take bread .
LEB	Matthew	16	6	And Jesus said to them , “ Watch out for and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! ”
LEB	Matthew	16	7	So they were discussing this [ j ] among themselves , saying , “ It is because we did not take bread. ”
LEB	Matthew	16	8	But knowing this , [ k ] Jesus said , “ Why are you discussing among yourselves that you did not take bread , [ l ] you of little faith ?
LEB	Matthew	16	9	Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many baskets you took up ?
LEB	Matthew	16	10	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you took up ?
LEB	Matthew	16	11	How do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread ? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! ”
LEB	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . Peter ’ s Confession at Caesarea Philippi
LEB	Matthew	16	13	Now when [ m ] Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi , [ n ] he began asking [ o ] his disciples , saying , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
LEB	Matthew	16	14	And they said , Some [ p ] say John the Baptist , but others Elijah , and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. ”
LEB	Matthew	16	15	He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
LEB	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answered and [ r ] said to him , “ Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah , because flesh and blood did not reveal this [ s ] to you , but my Father who is in heaven .

LEB	Matthew	16	24	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ If anyone wants to come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me .

LEB	Matthew	17	17	And Jesus answered and [ j ] said , “ O unbelieving and perverse generation ! How long [ k ] will I be with you ? How long [ l ] must I put up with you ? Bring him here to me ! ”
LEB	Matthew	17	2	And he was transfigured before them , and his face shone like the sun , and his clothing became bright as the light .
LEB	Matthew	17	3	And behold , Moses and Elijah appeared to them , talking with him .
LEB	Matthew	17	4	So Peter answered and [ a ] said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good that we are here ! If you want , I will make here three shelters , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah. ”
LEB	Matthew	17	5	While [ b ] he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and behold , a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . Listen to him ! ”
LEB	Matthew	17	6	And when [ c ] the disciples heard this , [ d ] they fell down on their faces and were extremely frightened .
LEB	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came and touched them and [ e ] said , “ Get up and do not be afraid. ”
LEB	Matthew	17	8	And when they [ f ] lifted up their eyes they saw no one except him—Jesus alone .
LEB	Matthew	17	9	And as [ g ] they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them saying , “ Tell no one the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead. ”
LEB	Matthew	17	10	And the disciples asked him , saying , “ Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
LEB	Matthew	17	11	And he answered and [ h ] said , “ Elijah indeed is coming , and will restore all things .
LEB	Matthew	17	12	But I say to you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him , but did with him whatever they wanted . In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands. ”
LEB	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist . A Demon-possessed Boy Healed
LEB	Matthew	17	14	And when they [ i ] came to the crowd , a man approached him , kneeling down before him
LEB	Matthew	17	15	and saying , “ Lord , have mercy on my son , because he has seizures and suffers severely , for often he falls into the fire and often into the water .
LEB	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to your disciples , and they were not able to heal him. ”
LEB	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked him , and the demon came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour .
LEB	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and [ m ] said , Why [ n ] were we not able to expel it ? ”
LEB	Matthew	17	20	And he said to them , “ Because of your little faith .

LEB	Matthew	18	18	“ Truly I say to you , whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven , and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven .
LEB	Matthew	18	2	And calling a child to himself , he had him stand in their midst
LEB	Matthew	18	3	and said , “ Truly I say to you , unless you turn around and become like young children , you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven !
LEB	Matthew	18	4	Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child , this person is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ,
LEB	Matthew	18	5	and whoever welcomes one child such as this in my name welcomes me .
LEB	Matthew	18	6	But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him that a large millstone [ a ] be hung on [ b ] his neck and he be drowned in the depths of the sea .
LEB	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world because of causes for stumbling , for it is a necessity that causes for stumbling come ; nevertheless , woe to the person through whom the cause for stumbling comes .
LEB	Matthew	18	8	And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it [ c ] from you ! It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than , having two hands or two feet , to be thrown into the eternal fire !
LEB	Matthew	18	9	And if your eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it [ d ] from you ! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than , having two eyes , to be thrown into fiery hell ! The Parable of the Lost Sheep
LEB	Matthew	18	10	“ See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven . [ e ]
LEB	Matthew	18	12	What do you think ? If a certain man has [ f ] a hundred sheep , and one of them wanders away , will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and [ g ] look for the one that wandered away ?
LEB	Matthew	18	13	And if he happens to find it , truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away .
LEB	Matthew	18	14	In the same way it is not the will of [ h ] your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish . Confronting a Brother Who Sins Against You
LEB	Matthew	18	15	“ Now if your brother sins against you , go correct him between you and him alone . If he listens to you , you have gained your brother .
LEB	Matthew	18	16	But if he does not listen , take with you in addition one or two others , so that by the testimony [ i ] of two or three witnesses every matter may be established .
LEB	Matthew	18	17	And if he refuses to listen to them , tell it [ j ] to the church . But if he refuses to listen to the church also , let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector .
LEB	Matthew	18	19	Again , truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask , it will be done for them from my Father who is in heaven .
LEB	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered in my name , I am there in the midst of them. ” The Parable of the Unforgiving Slave
LEB	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came up to him and [ k ] said , [ l ] “ Lord , how many times will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him ? Up to seven times ? ”
LEB	Matthew	18	22	Jesus said to him , “ I do not say to you up to seven times , but up to seventy times seven ! [ m ]
LEB	Matthew	18	23	“ For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves .
LEB	Matthew	18	24	And when [ n ] he began to settle them , [ o ] someone was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents .
LEB	Matthew	18	25	And because [ p ] he did not have enough [ q ] to repay it , [ r ] the master ordered him to be sold , and his [ s ] wife and his [ t ] children and everything that he had , and to be repaid .
LEB	Matthew	18	26	Then the slave threw himself to the ground and [ u ] began to do obeisance to him , saying , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay back everything to you ! ’
LEB	Matthew	18	27	So the master of that slave , because he [ v ] had compassion , released him and forgave him the loan .
LEB	Matthew	18	28	But that slave went out and [ w ] found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii , and taking hold of him , he began to choke him , [ x ] saying , ‘ Pay back everything that you owe ! ’
LEB	Matthew	18	29	Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and [ y ] began to implore [ z ] him , saying , ‘ Be patient with me and I will repay you ! ’
LEB	Matthew	18	30	But he did not want to , but rather he went and [ aa ] threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed .
LEB	Matthew	18	31	So when [ ab ] his fellow slaves saw what had happened , they were extremely distressed , and went and [ ac ] reported to their master everything that had happened .
LEB	Matthew	18	32	Then his master summoned him and [ ad ] said to him , ‘ Wicked slave ! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me !
LEB	Matthew	18	33	Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you ? ’
LEB	Matthew	18	34	And because he [ ae ] was angry , his master handed him over to the merciless jailers [ af ] until he would repay everything that was owed .

LEB	Matthew	19	2	And large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
LEB	Matthew	19	3	And Pharisees came up to him in order to [ a ] test him , and asked [ b ] if it was permitted for a man to divorce his wife for any cause .

LEB	Matthew	19	6	So then , they are no longer two but one flesh . Therefore what God has joined together , man must not separate. ”
LEB	Matthew	19	7	They said to him , “ Why then did Moses command us [ h ] to give a document—a certificate of divorce—and to divorce her ? ”
LEB	Matthew	19	8	He said to them , “ Moses , with reference to your hardness of heart , permitted you to divorce your wives , but from the beginning it was not like this .
LEB	Matthew	19	9	Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife , except on the basis of sexual immorality , and marries another commits adultery , and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery. ” [ i ]
LEB	Matthew	19	10	The disciples [ j ] said to him , “ If this is the case of a man with his [ k ] wife , it would be better not to marry ! ”

LEB	Matthew	21	21	And Jesus answered and [ z ] said to them , “ Truly I say to you , if you have faith and do not doubt , you will do not only what was done to the fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ” it will happen !
LEB	Matthew	21	2	saying to them , “ Go into the village before you , and right away you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her . Untie them [ a ] and [ b ] bring them [ c ] to me .
LEB	Matthew	21	3	And if anyone says anything to you , you will say , ‘ The Lord needs them , ’ [ d ] and he will send them at once. ”
LEB	Matthew	21	4	Now this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled , saying ,
LEB	Matthew	21	5	“ Say to the daughter of Zion , ‘ Behold , your king is coming to you , humble and mounted on a donkey , and [ e ] on a colt , the foal of a pack animal. ’ ” [ f ]
LEB	Matthew	21	6	So the disciples went [ g ] and did [ h ] just as Jesus directed them ,
LEB	Matthew	21	7	and [ i ] brought the donkey and the colt and put their [ j ] cloaks on them , and he sat on them .
LEB	Matthew	21	8	And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road , and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them [ k ] on the road .
LEB	Matthew	21	9	And the crowds who went ahead of him and the ones who followed were shouting , saying , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! [ l ] Hosanna in the highest heaven ! ” [ m ]
LEB	Matthew	21	10	And when [ n ] he entered into Jerusalem , the whole city was stirred up , saying , “ Who is this ? ”
LEB	Matthew	21	11	And the crowds were saying , “ This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee ! ” The Cleansing of the Temple
LEB	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus entered the temple courts [ o ] and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple , and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves .
LEB	Matthew	21	13	And he said to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house will be called a house of prayer , ’ [ p ] but you have made it a cave of robbers ! ”
LEB	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came up to him in the temple courts [ q ] and he healed them .
LEB	Matthew	21	15	But when [ r ] the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children shouting in the temple courts [ s ] and saying , “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! ” they were indignant .
LEB	Matthew	21	16	And they said to him , “ Do you hear what these children [ t ] are saying ? ” So Jesus said to them , “ Yes , have you never read , ‘ Out of the mouths of children and nursing babies you have prepared for yourself praise ’ ? ” [ u ]
LEB	Matthew	21	17	And leaving them , he went outside of the city to Bethany and spent the night there . A Barren Fig Tree Cursed
LEB	Matthew	21	18	Now early in the morning , as he [ v ] was returning to the city , he was hungry .
LEB	Matthew	21	19	And seeing a single fig tree by the road , he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only . And he said to it , “ May there be no more fruit from you forever , [ w ] and the fig tree withered at once .
LEB	Matthew	21	20	And when they [ x ] saw it , [ y ] the disciples were astonished , saying , “ How did the fig tree wither at once ? ”
LEB	Matthew	21	22	And whatever you ask in prayer , if you [ aa ] believe , you will receive. ” Jesus ’ Authority Challenged
LEB	Matthew	21	23	And after [ ab ] he arrived at the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he [ ac ] was teaching , saying , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? And who gave you this authority ? ”
LEB	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answered and [ ad ] said to them , “ I also will ask you one question . If you tell the answer [ ae ] to me , I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things .
LEB	Matthew	21	25	From where was the baptism of John—from heaven or from men ? ” And they began to discuss [ af ] this [ ag ] among themselves , saying , “ If we say ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Why then did you not believe him ? ’
LEB	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we are afraid of the crowd , because they all look upon John as a prophet. ”
LEB	Matthew	21	27	And they answered and [ ah ] said to Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And he said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things . The Parable of the Two Sons
LEB	Matthew	21	28	“ Now what do you think ? A man had two sons . He approached [ ai ] the first and [ aj ] said , ‘ Son , go work in the vineyard today. ’
LEB	Matthew	21	29	And he answered and [ ak ] said , ‘ I do not want to ! ’ But later he changed his mind and [ al ] went .
LEB	Matthew	21	30	And he approached the second [ am ] and [ an ] said the same thing . So he answered and [ ao ] said , ‘ I will , sir , ’ and he did not go .
LEB	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two did the will of his [ ap ] father ? ” They said , “ The first. ” Jesus said to them , “ Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God !
LEB	Matthew	21	32	For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him . And when [ aq ] you saw it , [ ar ] you did not even change your minds later so as to believe in him . The Parable of the Tenant Farmers in the Vineyard
LEB	Matthew	21	33	“ Listen to another parable : There was a man—a master of a house—who planted a vineyard , and put a fence around it , and dug a winepress in it , and built a watchtower , and leased it to tenant farmers , and went on a journey .
LEB	Matthew	21	34	And when the season of fruit drew near , he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit .
LEB	Matthew	21	35	And the tenant farmers seized his slaves , one of whom they beat , and one of whom they killed , and one of whom they stoned .
LEB	Matthew	21	36	Again , he sent other slaves , more than the first ones , and they did the same thing to them .
LEB	Matthew	21	37	So finally he sent his son to them , saying , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
LEB	Matthew	21	38	But when [ as ] the tenant farmers saw the son , they said among themselves , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and have his inheritance ! ’
LEB	Matthew	21	39	And they seized him and [ at ] threw him [ au ] out of the vineyard and killed him . [ av ]
LEB	Matthew	21	40	Now when the master of the vineyard arrives , what will he do to those tenant farmers ? ”
LEB	Matthew	21	41	They said to him , “ He will destroy those evil men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruits in their season. ”
LEB	Matthew	21	42	Jesus said to them , “ Have you never read in the scriptures , ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , this has become the cornerstone . [ aw ] This came about from the Lord , and it is marvelous in our eyes ’ ? [ ax ]
LEB	Matthew	21	43	For this reason , I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a people [ ay ] who produce its fruits .
LEB	Matthew	21	44	And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him ! ”
LEB	Matthew	21	45	And when [ az ] the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they knew that he was speaking about them ,

LEB	Matthew	22	22	And when they [ p ] heard this , [ q ] they were astonished , and they left him and [ r ] went away . A Question About Marriage and the Resurrection
LEB	Matthew	22	2	“ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who gave a wedding celebration for his son .
LEB	Matthew	22	3	And he sent his slaves to summon those who had been invited to the wedding celebration , and they did not want to come .
LEB	Matthew	22	4	Again he sent other slaves , saying , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , “ Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding celebration ! ” ’
LEB	Matthew	22	5	But they paid no attention and [ a ] went away—this one to his own field , that one to his business .
LEB	Matthew	22	6	And the others , seizing his slaves , mistreated them [ b ] and killed them . [ c ]
LEB	Matthew	22	7	And the king was angry and sent his troops and [ d ] destroyed those murderers and burned their city .
LEB	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his slaves , ‘ The wedding celebration is ready , but those who had been invited were not worthy .
LEB	Matthew	22	9	Therefore , go out to the places where the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many people as you find. ’
LEB	Matthew	22	10	And those slaves went out into the roads and [ e ] gathered everyone whom they found , both evil and good , and the wedding celebration was filled with dinner guests . [ f ]
LEB	Matthew	22	11	But when [ g ] the king came in to see the dinner guests , [ h ] he saw a man there not dressed in wedding clothes .
LEB	Matthew	22	12	And he said to him , ‘ Friend , how did you come in here , not having wedding clothes ? ’ But he could say nothing . [ i ]
LEB	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the servants , ‘ Tie him up hand and foot [ j ] and [ k ] throw him into the outer darkness . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth ! ’
LEB	Matthew	22	14	For many are called but few are chosen. ” Paying Taxes to Caesar
LEB	Matthew	22	15	Then the Pharisees went and consulted [ l ] so that they could entrap him with a statement .
LEB	Matthew	22	16	And they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians , saying , “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth , and you do not care what anyone thinks , [ m ] because you do not regard the opinion of people . [ n ]
LEB	Matthew	22	17	Therefore tell us what you think . Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ”
LEB	Matthew	22	18	But because he [ o ] knew their maliciousness , Jesus said , “ Hypocrites ! Why are you testing me ?
LEB	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin for the tax ! ” So they brought him a denarius .
LEB	Matthew	22	20	And he said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ”
LEB	Matthew	22	21	They said to him , “ Caesar ’ s. ” Then he said to them , “ Therefore give to Caesar the things of Caesar , and to God the things of God ! ”
LEB	Matthew	22	23	On that day Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and asked him ,
LEB	Matthew	22	24	saying , “ Teacher , Moses said if someone dies without having children , his brother is to marry his wife and father [ s ] descendants for his brother .
LEB	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers with us . And the first died after [ t ] getting married , and because he [ u ] did not have descendants , he left his wife to his brother .
LEB	Matthew	22	26	So also the second and the third , up to the seventh .
LEB	Matthew	22	27	And last of all the woman died .
LEB	Matthew	22	28	In the resurrection , therefore , whose wife of the seven will she be ? For they all had her as wife. ” [ v ]
LEB	Matthew	22	29	But Jesus answered and [ w ] said to them , “ You are mistaken , because [ x ] you do not know the scriptures or the power of God !
LEB	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are like angels of God [ y ] in heaven .
LEB	Matthew	22	31	Now concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was spoken to you by God , who said ,
LEB	Matthew	22	32	“ I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ” ? [ z ] He is not the God of the dead , but of the living ! ”
LEB	Matthew	22	33	And when [ aa ] the crowds heard this , [ ab ] they were amazed at his teaching . The Greatest Commandment
LEB	Matthew	22	34	Now when [ ac ] the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , they assembled at the same place . [ ad ]
LEB	Matthew	22	35	And one of them , a legal expert , put a question to him [ ae ] to test him :
LEB	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which commandment is greatest in the law ? ”
LEB	Matthew	22	37	And he said to him , “ ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. ’ [ af ]
LEB	Matthew	22	38	This is the greatest and first commandment .
LEB	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like it : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ [ ag ]
LEB	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets. ” David ’ s Son and Lord
LEB	Matthew	22	41	Now while [ ah ] the Pharisees were assembled , Jesus asked them ,
LEB	Matthew	22	42	saying , “ What do you think about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They said to him , “ David ’ s. ”
LEB	Matthew	22	43	He said to them , “ How then does David , by the Spirit , call him ‘ Lord , ’ saying ,
LEB	Matthew	22	44	‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet ” ’ ? [ ai ]

LEB	Matthew	23	27	“ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites ! —because you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful , but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and of everything unclean !

LEB	Matthew	23	33	Serpents ! Offspring of vipers ! How will you escape from the condemnation to hell ?
LEB	Matthew	23	34	For this reason , behold , I am sending to you prophets and wise men and scribes . Some of them you will kill and crucify , and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and will pursue from town to town ,

LEB	Matthew	24	24	For false messiahs and false prophets will appear , and will produce great signs and wonders in order to deceive , if possible , even the elect .
LEB	Matthew	24	2	But he answered and [ b ] said to them , “ Do you not see all these things ? Truly I say to you , not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down ! ” Signs of the End of the Age
LEB	Matthew	24	3	And as [ c ] he was sitting on the Mount of Olives , the disciples came up to him privately , saying , “ Tell us , when will these things happen , and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age ? ”
LEB	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and [ d ] said to them , “ Watch out that no one deceives you !
LEB	Matthew	24	5	For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am the Christ , ’ and they will deceive many .
LEB	Matthew	24	6	And you are going to hear about wars and rumors of wars . See to it that you are not alarmed , for this must happen , but the end is not yet .
LEB	Matthew	24	7	For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom , and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places . [ e ]
LEB	Matthew	24	8	But all these things are the beginning of birth pains . Persecution of Disciples Predicted
LEB	Matthew	24	9	“ Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you , and you will be hated by all the nations [ f ] because of my name .
LEB	Matthew	24	10	And then many will be led into sin and will betray one another and will hate one another ,
LEB	Matthew	24	11	and many false prophets will appear and will deceive many ,
LEB	Matthew	24	12	and because lawlessness will increase , the love of many will grow cold .
LEB	Matthew	24	13	But the one who endures to the end—this person will be saved .
LEB	Matthew	24	14	And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations , [ g ] and then the end will come . The Abomination of Desolation
LEB	Matthew	24	15	“ So when you see the abomination of desolation [ h ] spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place ” ( let the one who reads understand ) ,
LEB	Matthew	24	16	“ then those in Judea must flee to the mountains !
LEB	Matthew	24	17	The one who is on his [ i ] housetop must not come down to take things out of his house ,
LEB	Matthew	24	18	and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak .
LEB	Matthew	24	19	And woe to those who are pregnant [ j ] and to those who are nursing their babies [ k ] in those days !
LEB	Matthew	24	20	But pray that your flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath .
LEB	Matthew	24	21	For at that time there will be great tribulation , such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now , nor ever will happen .
LEB	Matthew	24	22	And unless those days had been shortened , no human being would be saved . [ l ] But for the sake of the elect , those days will be shortened .
LEB	Matthew	24	23	“ At that time if anyone should say to you , ‘ Behold , here is the Christ , ’ or ‘ Here he is , ’ do not believe him ! [ m ]
LEB	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you ahead of time !
LEB	Matthew	24	26	Therefore if they say to you , ‘ Behold , he is in the wilderness , ’ do not go out , or [ n ] ‘ Behold , he is in the inner rooms , ’ do not believe it ! [ o ]
LEB	Matthew	24	27	For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west , so the coming of the Son of Man will be .
LEB	Matthew	24	28	Wherever the corpse is , there the vultures will gather . The Arrival of the Son of Man
LEB	Matthew	24	29	“ And immediately after the tribulation of those days , ‘ the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light , and the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of heaven will be shaken. ’ [ p ]
LEB	Matthew	24	30	And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven , [ q ] and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and they will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven [ r ] with power and great glory .
LEB	Matthew	24	31	And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call , and they will gather his elect together from the four winds , from one end of heaven [ s ] to the other end of it . The Parable of the Fig Tree
LEB	Matthew	24	32	“ Now learn the parable from the fig tree : Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its [ t ] leaves , you know that summer is near .
LEB	Matthew	24	33	So also you , when you see all these things , know [ u ] that he is near , at the door .
LEB	Matthew	24	34	Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place !
LEB	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away . The Unknown Day and Hour
LEB	Matthew	24	36	“ But concerning that day and hour no one knows—not even the angels of heaven nor the Son—except the Father alone .
LEB	Matthew	24	37	For just as the days of Noah were , so the coming of the Son of Man will be .
LEB	Matthew	24	38	For as in the days [ v ] before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day Noah entered into the ark .
LEB	Matthew	24	39	And they did not know anything [ w ] until the deluge came and swept them [ x ] all away . So also the coming of the Son of Man will be .
LEB	Matthew	24	40	Then there will be two men in the field ; one will be taken and one left .
LEB	Matthew	24	41	Two women will be grinding at the mill ; one will be taken and one left .
LEB	Matthew	24	42	Therefore be on the alert , because you do not know what day your Lord is coming !
LEB	Matthew	24	43	But understand this : that if the master of the house had known what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into .
LEB	Matthew	24	44	For this reason you also must be ready , because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come . [ y ] A Faithful Slave and an Unfaithful Slave
LEB	Matthew	24	45	“ Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has put in charge of his household slaves to give them their [ z ] food at the right time ?
LEB	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he [ aa ] comes back .
LEB	Matthew	24	47	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
LEB	Matthew	24	48	But if that evil slave should say to himself , [ ab ] ‘ My master is staying away for a long time , ’
LEB	Matthew	24	49	and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards ,
LEB	Matthew	24	50	the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know ,
LEB	Matthew	24	51	and will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites . In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth !

LEB	Matthew	25	25	And because I [ r ] was afraid , I went away and [ s ] hid your talent in the ground . See , you have what is yours ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	2	Now five of them were foolish and five were wise .
LEB	Matthew	25	3	For when [ b ] the foolish ones took their lamps , they did not take olive oil with them .
LEB	Matthew	25	4	But the wise ones took olive oil in flasks with their lamps .
LEB	Matthew	25	5	And when [ c ] the bridegroom was delayed , they all became drowsy and fell asleep . [ d ]
LEB	Matthew	25	6	But in the middle of the night there was a shout , ‘ Behold , the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps .
LEB	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish ones said to the wise ones , ‘ Give us some of your olive oil , because our lamps are going out ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	9	But the wise ones answered saying , “ Certainly there will never be enough for us and for you ! Go instead to those who sell olive oil [ e ] and buy some [ f ] for yourselves. ’
LEB	Matthew	25	10	But while [ g ] they had gone away to buy it [ h ] the bridegroom arrived , and those who were ready went inside with him to the wedding celebration , and the door was shut .
LEB	Matthew	25	11	And later the other virgins came also , saying , ‘ Lord , lord , open the door [ i ] for us ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	12	But he answered and [ j ] said , ‘ Truly I say to you , I do not know you ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	13	Therefore be on the alert , because you do not know the day or the hour ! The Parable of the Talents
LEB	Matthew	25	14	For it is like a man going on a journey . He summoned his own slaves and handed over his property to them .
LEB	Matthew	25	15	And to one he gave five talents , and to another two , and to another one , to each one according to his own ability , and he went on a journey immediately .
LEB	Matthew	25	16	The one who had received the five talents went out and [ k ] traded with them and gained five more .
LEB	Matthew	25	17	In the same way the one who had the two gained two more .
LEB	Matthew	25	18	But the one who had received the one went away and [ l ] dug up the ground and hid his master ’ s money .
LEB	Matthew	25	19	Now after a long time , the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them .
LEB	Matthew	25	20	And the one who had received the five talents came up and [ m ] brought five more talents , saying , ‘ Master , you handed over to me five talents . See , I have gained five more talents ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	21	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful slave ! You were faithful over a few things ; I will put you in charge over many things . Enter into the joy of your master ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	22	And the one who had the two talents also came up and [ n ] said , ‘ Master , you handed over to me two talents . See , I have gained two talents more ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	23	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful slave ! You were faithful over a few things ; I will put you in charge over many things . Enter into the joy of your master ! ’
LEB	Matthew	25	24	And the one who had received the one talent came up also and [ o ] said , ‘ Master , because I [ p ] knew you , that you are a hard man , reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter seed . [ q ]
LEB	Matthew	25	26	But his master answered and [ t ] said to him , ‘ Evil and lazy slave ! You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter seed . [ u ]
LEB	Matthew	25	27	Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers , and when I [ v ] returned I would have gotten back what was mine with interest !
LEB	Matthew	25	28	Therefore take the talent from him and give it [ w ] to the one who has the ten talents .
LEB	Matthew	25	29	For to everyone who has , more will be given , and he will have an abundance . But from the one who does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him .
LEB	Matthew	25	30	And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness—in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth ! ’ The Judgment of the Sheep and the Goats
LEB	Matthew	25	31	Now when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him , then he will sit on his glorious throne .
LEB	Matthew	25	32	And all the nations will be gathered before him , and he will separate them from one another like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
LEB	Matthew	25	33	And he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on the left .
LEB	Matthew	25	34	Then the king will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by my Father . Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world !
LEB	Matthew	25	35	For I was hungry and you gave me something [ x ] to eat , I was thirsty and you gave me something [ y ] to drink , I was a stranger and you welcomed me as a guest ,
LEB	Matthew	25	36	I was naked and you clothed me , I was sick and you cared for me , I was in prison and you came to me. ’
LEB	Matthew	25	37	Then the righteous will answer him , saying , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , [ z ] or thirsty and give you something [ aa ] to drink ?
LEB	Matthew	25	38	And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you [ ab ] as a guest , or naked and clothe you ? [ ac ]
LEB	Matthew	25	39	And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you ? ’
LEB	Matthew	25	40	And the king will answer and [ ad ] say to them , ‘ Truly I say to you , in as much as you did it [ ae ] to one of the least of these brothers of mine , you did it [ af ] to me. ’
LEB	Matthew	25	41	Then he will also say to those on his left , ‘ Depart from me , you accursed ones , into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels !
LEB	Matthew	25	42	For I was hungry and you did not give me anything [ ag ] to eat , I was thirsty and you did not give me anything [ ah ] to drink ,
LEB	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger and you did not welcome me as a guest , naked and you did not clothe me , sick and in prison and you did not care for me. ’
LEB	Matthew	25	44	Then they will also answer , saying , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not serve you ? ’
LEB	Matthew	25	45	Then he will answer them , saying , ‘ Truly I say to you , in as much as you did not do it [ ai ] to one of the least of these , you did not do it [ aj ] to me. ’

LEB	Matthew	26	23	And he answered and [ r ] said , “ The one who dips his [ s ] hand in the bowl with me—this one will betray me .
LEB	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed ! It would be better for him if that man had not been born. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	25	And Judas , the one who was betraying him , answered and [ t ] said , “ Surely I am not he , am I , [ u ] Rabbi ? ” He said to him , “ You have said it. ” [ v ] The Lord ’ s Supper
LEB	Matthew	26	27	And after [ aa ] taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it [ ab ] to them , saying , “ Drink from it , all of you ,
LEB	Matthew	26	28	for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins .
LEB	Matthew	26	29	But I tell you , from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	30	And after they [ ac ] had sung the hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives . Jesus Predicts Peter ’ s Denial
LEB	Matthew	26	31	Then Jesus said to them , “ You will all fall away because of me during this night , for it is written , ‘ I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ’ [ ad ]
LEB	Matthew	26	32	But after I am raised , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	33	But Peter answered and [ ae ] said to him , “ If they all fall away because of you , I will never fall away ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said to him , “ Truly I say to you that during this night , before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	35	Peter said to him , “ Even if it is necessary for me to die with you , I will never deny you ! ” And all the disciples said the same thing . The Prayer in Gethsemane
LEB	Matthew	26	36	Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane , and he said to the disciples , “ Sit here while I go over there and [ af ] pray. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	37	And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be distressed and troubled .
LEB	Matthew	26	38	Then he said to them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , to the point of death . Remain here and stay awake with me. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	39	And going forward a little he fell down on his face , praying and saying , “ My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from me . Nevertheless , not as I will , but as you will. ” [ ag ]
LEB	Matthew	26	40	And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping , and he said to Peter , “ So , were you not able to stay awake with me one hour ?
LEB	Matthew	26	41	Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	42	Again for the second time he went away and [ ah ] prayed , saying , “ My Father , if this can not pass unless I drink it , your will must be done. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	43	And he came again and [ ai ] found them sleeping , for they could not keep their eyes open . [ aj ]
LEB	Matthew	26	44	And leaving them again , he went away and [ ak ] prayed for the third time , saying the same thing again .
LEB	Matthew	26	45	Then he came to the disciples and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? Behold , the hour is near , and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .
LEB	Matthew	26	46	Get up , let us go ! Behold , the one who is betraying me is approaching ! ” The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus
LEB	Matthew	26	47	And while [ al ] he was still speaking , behold , Judas—one of the twelve—arrived , and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
LEB	Matthew	26	48	Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign , saying , “ The one whom I kiss—he is the one . [ am ] Arrest him ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	49	And he came up to Jesus immediately and [ an ] said , “ Greetings , Rabbi , ” and kissed him .
LEB	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said to him , “ Friend , do that [ ao ] for which you have come. ” [ ap ] Then they came up and [ aq ] laid hands on Jesus and arrested him .
LEB	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of those with Jesus extended his [ ar ] hand and [ as ] drew his sword , and striking the slave of the high priest , cut off his ear .
LEB	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put your sword back into its place ! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword .
LEB	Matthew	26	53	Or do you think that I can not call upon my Father , and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels ?
LEB	Matthew	26	54	How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way ? ”
LEB	Matthew	26	55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs , as against a robber , to arrest me ? Every day in the temple courts [ at ] I sat teaching , and you did not arrest me !
LEB	Matthew	26	56	But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled. ” Then the disciples all abandoned him and [ au ] fled . Jesus Before the Sanhedrin
LEB	Matthew	26	57	Now those who had arrested Jesus led him [ av ] away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders had gathered .
LEB	Matthew	26	58	But Peter was following him from a distance , as far as the courtyard of the high priest . And he went inside and [ aw ] was sitting with the officers to see the outcome .
LEB	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death .
LEB	Matthew	26	60	And they did not find it , [ ax ] although [ ay ] many false witnesses came forward . And finally two came forward
LEB	Matthew	26	61	and [ az ] said , “ This man said , ‘ I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it [ ba ] within three days. ’ ”
LEB	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest stood up and [ bb ] said to him , “ Do you reply nothing ? What are these people testifying against you ? ”
LEB	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus was silent . And the high priest said to him , “ I put you under oath by the living God , that you tell us if you are the Christ , the Son of God ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	64	Jesus said to him , “ You have said it . [ bc ] But I tell you , from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power [ bd ] and coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his robes , saying , “ He has blasphemed ! What further need do we have of witnesses ? Behold , you have just now heard the blasphemy !
LEB	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ” And they answered and [ be ] said , “ He deserves death ! ” [ bf ]
LEB	Matthew	26	67	Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists , and they slapped him , [ bg ]
LEB	Matthew	26	68	saying , “ Prophesy for us , you Christ ! Who is it who hit you ? ” Peter Denies Jesus Three Times
LEB	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard , and a female slave came up to him and [ bh ] said , “ You also were with Jesus the Galilean. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it [ bi ] in the presence of them all , saying , “ I do not know what you mean ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	71	And when he [ bj ] went out to the gateway , another female slave [ bk ] saw him and said to those who were there , “ This man was with Jesus the Nazarene. ”
LEB	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it [ bl ] with an oath , “ I do not know the man ! ”
LEB	Matthew	26	73	And after a little while those who were standing there came up and [ bm ] said to Peter , “ You really are one of them also , because even your accent reveals who you are. ” [ bn ]
LEB	Matthew	26	74	Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath , “ I do not know the man ! ” And immediately a rooster crowed .
LEB	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said , “ Before the rooster crows , you will deny me three times , ” and he went outside and [ bo ] wept bitterly .

LEB	Matthew	27	2	And after [ b ] tying him up , they led him [ c ] away and handed him [ d ] over to Pilate the governor . The Suicide of Judas Iscariot
LEB	Matthew	27	3	Then when [ e ] Judas , the one who had betrayed him , saw that he had been condemned , he regretted what he had done [ f ] and [ g ] returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders ,
LEB	Matthew	27	4	saying , “ I have sinned by [ h ] betraying innocent blood ! ” But they said , “ What is that to us ? You see to it ! ” [ i ]
LEB	Matthew	27	5	And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed . And he went away and [ j ] hanged himself .
LEB	Matthew	27	6	But the chief priests took the silver coins and [ k ] said , “ It is not permitted to put them into the temple treasury , because it is blood money. ” [ l ]
LEB	Matthew	27	7	And after [ m ] taking counsel , they purchased with [ n ] them the Potter ’ s Field , for a burial place for strangers .
LEB	Matthew	27	8	( For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today . )
LEB	Matthew	27	9	Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled , who said , “ And they took the thirty silver coins , the price of the one who had been priced , on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel ,
LEB	Matthew	27	10	and they gave them for the potter ’ s field , just as the Lord directed me. ” [ o ] Jesus Before Pilate
LEB	Matthew	27	11	So Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor asked him , saying , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” And Jesus said , “ You say so. ”
LEB	Matthew	27	12	And when he was being accused [ p ] by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing .
LEB	Matthew	27	13	Then Pilate said to him , “ Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you ? ”
LEB	Matthew	27	14	And he did not reply to him , not even with reference to one statement , so that the governor was very astonished . Pilate Releases Barabbas
LEB	Matthew	27	15	Now at each feast , the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted .
LEB	Matthew	27	16	And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus [ q ] Barabbas . [ r ]
LEB	Matthew	27	17	So after [ s ] they had assembled , Pilate said to them , “ Whom do you want me to release for you—Jesus [ t ] Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? ”
LEB	Matthew	27	18	( For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy .
LEB	Matthew	27	19	And while [ u ] he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent a message [ v ] to him , saying , “ Have nothing to do with that righteous man , [ w ] for I have suffered much as a result of a dream today because of him. ” )
LEB	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death .
LEB	Matthew	27	21	So the governor answered and [ x ] said to them , “ Which of the two do you want me to release for you ? ” And they said , “ Barabbas ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	22	Pilate said to them , “ What then should I do with Jesus , the one who is called Christ ? ” They all said , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	23	And he said , “ Why ? What wrong has he done ? ” But they began to shout [ y ] even louder , saying , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	24	So Pilate , when he [ z ] saw that he was accomplishing nothing , but instead an uproar was developing , took water and [ aa ] washed his [ ab ] hands before the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of the blood of this man . You see to it ! ” [ ac ]
LEB	Matthew	27	25	And all the people answered and [ ad ] said , “ His blood be on us and on our children ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas for them , but after [ ae ] he had Jesus flogged , he handed him [ af ] over so that he could be crucified . Jesus Is Mocked
LEB	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped him and [ ah ] put a scarlet military cloak around him ,
LEB	Matthew	27	29	and weaving a crown of thorns , they put it [ ai ] on his head , and put [ aj ] a reed in his right hand . And kneeling down before him , they mocked him , saying , “ Hail , king of the Jews ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	30	And they spat on him and [ ak ] took the reed and repeatedly struck [ al ] him [ am ] on his head .
LEB	Matthew	27	31	And when they had mocked him , they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him , and led him away in order to crucify him . [ an ] Jesus Is Crucified
LEB	Matthew	27	32	And as they [ ao ] were going out , they found a man of Cyrene named [ ap ] Simon . They forced this man to carry his cross .
LEB	Matthew	27	33	And when they [ aq ] came to a place called Golgotha ( which means Place of a Skull ) , [ ar ]
LEB	Matthew	27	34	they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink , and when he [ as ] tasted it [ at ] he did not want to drink it . [ au ]
LEB	Matthew	27	35	And when they [ av ] had crucified him , they divided his clothes among themselves [ aw ] by [ ax ] casting lots .
LEB	Matthew	27	36	And they sat down and [ ay ] were watching over him there .
LEB	Matthew	27	37	And they put above his head the charge against him in writing : [ az ] “ This is Jesus , the king of the Jews. ”
LEB	Matthew	27	38	Then two robbers were crucified with him , one on his right and one on his left .
LEB	Matthew	27	39	And those who passed by reviled him , shaking their heads
LEB	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it [ ba ] in three days , save yourself ! If you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	41	In the same way also the chief priests , along with the scribes and elders , were mocking him , [ bb ] saying ,
LEB	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others ; he is not able to save himself ! He is the king of Israel ! Let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe in him !
LEB	Matthew	27	43	He trusts in God ; let him deliver him now if he wants to , [ bc ] because he said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	44	And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him . Jesus Dies on the Cross
LEB	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour , darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour .
LEB	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” ( that is , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ” ) [ bd ]
LEB	Matthew	27	47	And some of those who were standing there , when they [ be ] heard it , [ bf ] said , “ This man is summoning Elijah ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	48	And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it [ bg ] with sour wine and put it [ bh ] on a reed and [ bi ] gave it [ bj ] to him to drink .
LEB	Matthew	27	49	But the others said , “ Leave him [ bk ] alone ! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him. ”
LEB	Matthew	27	50	And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and [ bl ] gave up his [ bm ] spirit .
LEB	Matthew	27	51	And behold , the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom , and the earth shook and the rocks were split .
LEB	Matthew	27	52	And the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised ,
LEB	Matthew	27	53	and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection , they went into the holy city and appeared to many .
LEB	Matthew	27	54	Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus , when they [ bn ] saw the earthquake and the things that took place , were extremely frightened , saying , “ Truly this man was God ’ s Son ! ”
LEB	Matthew	27	55	And there were many women there , observing from a distance , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , serving him ,
LEB	Matthew	27	56	among whom were Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee . Jesus Is Buried
LEB	Matthew	27	57	Now when it was evening , a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came , who also was a disciple of Jesus himself .
LEB	Matthew	27	58	This man approached Pilate and [ bo ] asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate ordered it [ bp ] to be given to him . [ bq ]
LEB	Matthew	27	59	And Joseph took the body and [ br ] wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
LEB	Matthew	27	60	and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock . And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and [ bs ] went away .
LEB	Matthew	27	61	Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there , sitting opposite the tomb . The Tomb Is Sealed and Guarded
LEB	Matthew	27	62	Now on the next day , which is after the day of preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate ,
LEB	Matthew	27	63	saying , “ Sir , we remember that while [ bt ] that deceiver was still alive he said , ‘ After three days I will rise. ’
LEB	Matthew	27	64	Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest his disciples come and [ bu ] steal him and tell the people , ‘ He has been raised from the dead , ’ and the last deception will be worse than the first. ”
LEB	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You have a guard of soldiers . Go , make it [ bv ] as secure as you know how. ”
LEB	Matthew	27	66	So they went with the guard of soldiers and [ bw ] made the tomb secure by [ bx ] sealing the stone .

LEB	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ . [ a ]
LEB	Mark	1	2	Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah , “ Behold , I am sending my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way ,
LEB	Mark	1	3	the voice of one shouting in the wilderness , ‘ Prepare the way of the Lord , make straight his paths ! ’ ” [ b ]
LEB	Mark	1	4	John was there baptizing in the wilderness , proclaiming [ c ] a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
LEB	Mark	1	5	And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River , confessing their sins .
LEB	Mark	1	6	And John was dressed in camel ’ s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist , and he ate locusts and wild honey .
LEB	Mark	1	7	And he was preaching , saying , “ One who is more powerful than I is coming after me , of whom I am not worthy to bend down and [ d ] untie the strap of his sandals .
LEB	Mark	1	8	I baptized you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” The Baptism of Jesus
LEB	Mark	1	9	And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John .
LEB	Mark	1	10	And immediately as he [ e ] was coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him .
LEB	Mark	1	11	And a voice came from heaven , “ You are my beloved Son ; with you I am well pleased. ” The Temptation of Jesus
LEB	Mark	1	12	And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness .
LEB	Mark	1	13	And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan . And he was with the wild animals , and the angels were ministering to him . Public Ministry in Galilee
LEB	Mark	1	14	And after [ f ] John had been taken into custody , [ g ] Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God
LEB	Mark	1	15	and saying , “ The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near . Repent and believe in the gospel ! ” Jesus Calls His First Disciples
LEB	Mark	1	16	And as he [ h ] was passing by along the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew , Simon ’ s brother , casting a net [ i ] into the sea ( for they were fishermen ) .
LEB	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said to them , “ Follow [ j ] me and I will make you become fishers of people. ”
LEB	Mark	1	18	And immediately they left their nets and [ k ] followed him .
LEB	Mark	1	19	And going on a little farther , he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John , and they were in the boat mending the nets .
LEB	Mark	1	20	And immediately he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and [ l ] went away after him .
LEB	Mark	1	21	And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue . [ m ] A Man with an Unclean Spirit Healed
LEB	Mark	1	22	And they were amazed at his teaching , because he was teaching them like one who had authority , and not like the scribes .
LEB	Mark	1	23	And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit , and he cried out ,
LEB	Mark	1	24	saying , “ Leave us alone , [ n ] Jesus the Nazarene ! Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are—the Holy One of God ! ”
LEB	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent , and come out of him ! ”
LEB	Mark	1	26	And after [ o ] convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice , the unclean spirit came out of him .
LEB	Mark	1	27	And they were all amazed , so that they began to discuss with one another , saying , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority ! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him. ”
LEB	Mark	1	28	And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee . Many at Capernaum Are Healed
LEB	Mark	1	29	And so then he departed from the synagogue and [ p ] came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John .
LEB	Mark	1	30	Now Simon ’ s mother-in-law was lying down , suffering with a fever , and at once they told him about her .
LEB	Mark	1	31	And he came and [ q ] raised her up by [ r ] taking hold of her [ s ] hand , and the fever left her , and she began to serve them .
LEB	Mark	1	32	Now when it [ t ] was evening , when the sun had set , they began bringing [ u ] to him all those who were sick [ v ] and those who were demon-possessed .
LEB	Mark	1	33	And the whole town was gathered together at the door .
LEB	Mark	1	34	And he healed many who were sick [ w ] with various diseases and expelled many demons . And he did not permit the demons to speak , because they knew him . Preaching Throughout Galilee
LEB	Mark	1	35	And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark , he departed and went to a deserted place , and there he was praying .
LEB	Mark	1	36	And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him .
LEB	Mark	1	37	And they found him and said to him , “ Everyone is looking for you ! ”
LEB	Mark	1	38	And he said to them , “ Let us go elsewhere , into the neighboring rural towns , so that I can preach there also , because I have come out for this very reason. ”
LEB	Mark	1	39	And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons . A Leper Cleansed
LEB	Mark	1	40	And a leper came to him , entreating him and kneeling down , saying [ x ] to him , “ If you are willing , you are able to make me clean. ”
LEB	Mark	1	41	And becoming angry , [ y ] he stretched out his hand and [ z ] touched him [ aa ] , and said to him , “ I am willing ; be made clean. ”
LEB	Mark	1	42	And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean .
LEB	Mark	1	43	And warning him sternly , he sent him away at once .
LEB	Mark	1	44	And he said to him , “ See to it that you say nothing to anyone , but go , show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them .
LEB	Mark	1	45	But he went out and [ ab ] began to proclaim it [ ac ] freely and to spread abroad the account , so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town . But he was staying outside in deserted places , and they were coming to him from all directions .

LEB	Mark	2	2	And many had gathered , so that there was no longer room , not even at the door , and he was speaking the word to them .
LEB	Mark	2	3	And they came bringing to him a paralytic , carried by four of them .
LEB	Mark	2	4	And when [ b ] they were not able to bring him [ c ] to him because of the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . And after [ d ] digging through , they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying .
LEB	Mark	2	5	And when [ e ] Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Child , your sins are forgiven. ”
LEB	Mark	2	6	Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts ,
LEB	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man speak like this ? He is blaspheming ! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone ? ”
LEB	Mark	2	8	And immediately Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves , said to them , “ Why are you considering these things in your hearts ?
LEB	Mark	2	9	Which is easier to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say ‘ Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk ’ ?
LEB	Mark	2	10	But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” —he said to the paralytic—
LEB	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you , get up , pick up your stretcher , and go to your home. ”
LEB	Mark	2	12	And he got up and immediately picked up his [ f ] stretcher and [ g ] went out in front of them all , so that they were all amazed and glorified God , saying , “ We have never seen anything [ h ] like this ! ” Levi Called to Follow Jesus

LEB	Mark	2	15	And it happened that he was dining [ m ] in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with [ n ] Jesus and his disciples , for there were many and they were following him .
LEB	Mark	2	16	And the scribes of the Pharisees , when they [ o ] saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors , began to say [ p ] to his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
LEB	Mark	2	17	And when [ q ] Jesus heard it [ r ] , he said to them , “ Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician , but those who are sick . [ s ] I have not come to call the righteous , but sinners. ” On Fasting
LEB	Mark	2	18	And John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting , and they came and said to him , “ Why [ t ] do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
LEB	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said to them , “ The bridegroom ’ s attendants [ u ] are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them , are they ? [ v ] As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them , they are not able to fast .
LEB	Mark	2	20	But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast in that day .
LEB	Mark	2	21	No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment . Otherwise [ w ] the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse .
LEB	Mark	2	22	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise [ x ] the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too . But new wine is put into new wineskins. ” Plucking Grain on the Sabbath
LEB	Mark	2	23	And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath , and his disciples began to make their way while [ y ] plucking off the heads of grain .
LEB	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees began to say [ z ] to him , “ Behold , why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath ? ”
LEB	Mark	2	25	And he said to them , “ Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—
LEB	Mark	2	26	how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation , which it is not permitted to eat ( except the priests ) and also gave it [ aa ] to those who were with him ? ”
LEB	Mark	2	27	And he said to them , “ The Sabbath was established for people , and not people for the Sabbath .

LEB	Mark	3	24	And if a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom is not able to stand .
LEB	Mark	3	25	And if a house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
LEB	Mark	3	26	And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he is not able to stand , but is at an end !
LEB	Mark	3	27	But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong man and [ o ] plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man , and then he can thoroughly plunder his house .
LEB	Mark	3	28	“ Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men , however much they blaspheme .
LEB	Mark	3	29	But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness forever , [ p ] but is guilty of an eternal sin ” —
LEB	Mark	3	30	because they were saying , “ He has an unclean spirit. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers
LEB	Mark	3	31	And his mother and his brothers arrived , and standing outside , they sent word to him to summon him .
LEB	Mark	3	32	And a crowd was sitting around him , and they told him , “ Behold , your mother and your brothers [ q ] are outside looking for you. ”
LEB	Mark	3	33	And he answered them and [ r ] said , “ Who is my mother or [ s ] my brothers ? ”
LEB	Mark	3	34	And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle , he said , “ Behold , my mother and my brothers !
LEB	Mark	3	35	For whoever does the will of God , this person is my brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Mark 3:5 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Mark 3:5 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Mark 3:6 Literally “ began to give counsel ” ; the imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive ( “ began to ” ) - Mark 3:7 That is , the Sea of Galilee - Mark 3:7 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Mark 3:8 Here “ because ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ heard ” ) which is understood as causal - Mark 3:10 Literally “ had suffering ” - Mark 3:14 Some manuscripts add “ whom he also named apostles ” - Mark 3:16 Most Greek manuscripts omit the phrase “ and he appointed the twelve ” - Mark 3:18 Literally “ the Cananean , ” but according to BDAG

LEB	Mark	4	4	And it happened that while he was sowing , some seed [ d ] fell on the side of the path , and the birds came and devoured it .
LEB	Mark	4	2	And he began to teach [ c ] them many things in parables , and was saying to them in his teaching ,
LEB	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! Behold , the sower went out to sow .
LEB	Mark	4	5	And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil , and it sprang up at once , because it did not have any depth of soil .
LEB	Mark	4	6	And when the sun rose it was scorched , and because it did not have enough root , it withered .
LEB	Mark	4	7	And other seed fell among the thorn plants , and the thorn plants came up and choked it , and it did not produce grain . [ e ]
LEB	Mark	4	8	And other seed fell on the good soil , and produced grain , [ f ] coming up and increasing , and it bore a crop [ g ] —one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much . [ h ]
LEB	Mark	4	9	And he said , “ Whoever has ears to hear , let him hear ! ” The Reason for the Parables
LEB	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , those around him together with the twelve began asking [ i ] him about the parables .
LEB	Mark	4	11	And he said to them , “ To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God , but to those who are outside everything is in parables ,
LEB	Mark	4	12	so that ‘ they may look closely [ j ] and not perceive , and they may listen carefully [ k ] and not understand , lest they turn and it be forgiven them. ’ ” [ l ] The Parable of the Sower Interpreted
LEB	Mark	4	13	And he said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? And how will you understand all the parables ?
LEB	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the word .
LEB	Mark	4	15	And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown , and whenever they hear it , [ m ] immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them .
LEB	Mark	4	16	And these are like [ n ] the ones sown on the rocky ground , who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy .
LEB	Mark	4	17	And they have no root in themselves , but are temporary . Then when [ o ] affliction or persecution comes because of the word , immediately they fall away .
LEB	Mark	4	18	And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word ,
LEB	Mark	4	19	and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and [ p ] choke the word and it becomes unproductive .
LEB	Mark	4	20	And those are the ones sown on the good soil , who hear the word and receive it [ q ] and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much. ” [ r ] The Parable of the Lamp
LEB	Mark	4	21	And he said to them , “ Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed , is it ? [ s ] Is it not [ t ] so that it may be put on a lampstand ?
LEB	Mark	4	22	For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed , nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light .
LEB	Mark	4	23	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
LEB	Mark	4	24	And he said to them , “ Take care what you hear ! With the measure by which you measure out , it will be measured out to you , and will be added to you .
LEB	Mark	4	25	For whoever has , more will be given to him , and whoever does not have , even what he has will be taken away from him. ” The Parable of the Seed that Grows by Itself
LEB	Mark	4	26	And he said , “ The kingdom of God is like this : like a man scatters seed on the ground .
LEB	Mark	4	27	And he sleeps and gets up , night and day , and the seed sprouts and grows—he does not know how . [ u ]
LEB	Mark	4	28	By itself the soil produces a crop : first the grass , then the head of grain , then the full grain in the head .
LEB	Mark	4	29	But when the crop permits , he sends in the sickle right away , because the harvest has come. ” The Parable of the Mustard Seed
LEB	Mark	4	30	And he said , “ With what can we compare the kingdom of God , or by what parable can we present it ?
LEB	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground , although it [ v ] is the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground ,
LEB	Mark	4	32	but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs , and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade. ”
LEB	Mark	4	33	And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them , as they were able to hear it . [ w ]
LEB	Mark	4	34	And he did not speak to them without a parable , but in private he explained everything to his own disciples . Calming of a Storm
LEB	Mark	4	35	And on that day , when it [ x ] was evening , he said to them , “ Let us cross over to the other side. ”
LEB	Mark	4	36	And leaving the crowd , they took him along , as he was , in the boat . And other boats were with him .
LEB	Mark	4	37	And a great storm of wind developed , and the waves were breaking into the boat , so that the boat was already being filled with water . [ y ]
LEB	Mark	4	38	And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion , and they woke him up and said to him , “ Teacher , is it not a concern to you that we are perishing ? ”
LEB	Mark	4	39	And he woke up and [ z ] rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , “ Be quiet ! Be silent ! ” And the wind abated and there was a great calm .
LEB	Mark	4	40	And he said to them , “ Why are you fearful ? Do you not yet have faith ? ”
LEB	Mark	4	41	And they were terribly frightened [ aa ] and began to say [ ab ] to one another , “ Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? ” Footnotes - Mark 4:1 That is , the Sea of Galilee - Mark 4:1 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ got ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Mark 4:2 The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ( “ began to teach ” ) - Mark 4:4 Literally “ some of which ” - Mark 4:7 Literally “ fruit , ” describing here the grain harvested from the healthy plants ; in contemporary English this would more naturally be expressed by terms like “ grain ” or “ crop ” - Mark 4:8 Literally “ fruit , ” describing here the grain harvested from the healthy plants ; in contemporary English this would more naturally be expressed by terms like “ grain ” or “ crop ” - Mark 4:8 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Mark 4:8 The phrase “ times as much ” is not in the Greek text but is implied - Mark 4:10 The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ( “ began asking ” ) - Mark 4:12 Literally “ seeing they may see ” - Mark 4:12 Literally “ hearing they may hear ” - Mark 4:12 A quotation from Isa 6:9–10 - Mark 4:15 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Mark 4:16 Some manuscripts omit “ like ” - Mark 4:17 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ comes ” ) - Mark 4:19 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ come in ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Mark 4:20 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Mark 4:20 The phrase “ times as much ” is not in the Greek text but is implied - Mark 4:21 The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here , indicated in the translation by the phrase “ is it ” - Mark 4:21 The negative construction in Greek anticipates a positive answer here - Mark 4:27 Literally “ in such a way as he does not know ” - Mark 4:31 Here “ although ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ is ” ) which is understood as concessive - Mark 4:33 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Mark 4:35 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ was ” ) - Mark 4:37 * The words “ with water ” are not in the Greek text but are implied - Mark 4:39 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ woke up ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Mark 4:41 Literally “ they feared a great fear ” - Mark 4:41 The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ( “ began to say ” )

LEB	Mark	5	5	And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones .
LEB	Mark	5	2	And as [ c ] he was getting out of the boat , immediately from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit went to meet him ,
LEB	Mark	5	3	who lived [ d ] among the tombs . And no one was able to bind him any longer , not even with a chain ,
LEB	Mark	5	4	because he had often been bound with shackles and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the shackles had been shattered . And no one was strong enough to subdue him .
LEB	Mark	5	6	And when he [ e ] saw Jesus from a distance , he ran and knelt down before him .
LEB	Mark	5	7	And crying out with a loud voice he said , “ What have I to do with you [ f ] , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I implore you by God , do not torment me ! ”
LEB	Mark	5	8	( For he was saying to him , “ Come out of the man , unclean spirit ! ” )
LEB	Mark	5	9	And he was asking him “ What is your name ? ” [ g ] And he said to him , “ My name is Legion , because we are many. ”
LEB	Mark	5	10	And he was imploring him many times that he would not send them out of the region .
LEB	Mark	5	11	Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding ,
LEB	Mark	5	12	and they implored him , saying , “ Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them. ”
LEB	Mark	5	13	And he permitted them . And the unclean spirits came out and [ h ] entered into the pigs , and the herd—about two thousand—rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea .
LEB	Mark	5	14	And their herdsmen fled and reported it [ i ] in the town and in the countryside , and they came to see what it was that had happened .
LEB	Mark	5	15	And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid .
LEB	Mark	5	16	And those who had seen it [ j ] described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man , and about the pigs .
LEB	Mark	5	17	And they began to urge him to depart from their region .
LEB	Mark	5	18	And as [ k ] he was getting into the boat , the man who had been demon-possessed began to implore [ l ] him that he could go with him .
LEB	Mark	5	19	And he did not permit him , but said to him , “ Go to your home to your people and tell them all that the Lord has done for you , and that he has had mercy on you. ”
LEB	Mark	5	20	And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him , and they were all astonished . A Woman Healed and a Daughter Raised
LEB	Mark	5	21	And after [ m ] Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side , a large crowd gathered to him , and he was beside the sea .
LEB	Mark	5	22	And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and when he [ n ] saw him , he fell down at his feet .
LEB	Mark	5	23	And he was imploring him many times , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death ! [ o ] Come , lay your [ p ] hands on her , so that she will get well and will live. ”
LEB	Mark	5	24	And he went with him , and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him .
LEB	Mark	5	25	And there was a woman who was suffering from hemorrhages [ q ] twelve years .
LEB	Mark	5	26	And she had endured many things under many physicians , and had spent all that she had [ r ] and had received no help at all , but instead became worse . [ s ]
LEB	Mark	5	27	When she [ t ] heard about Jesus , she came up in the crowd behind him and [ u ] touched his cloak ,
LEB	Mark	5	28	for she was saying , “ If I touch just his clothing , I will be healed ! ”
LEB	Mark	5	29	And immediately her hemorrhage stopped [ v ] and she realized in her [ w ] body that she was healed of her [ x ] suffering .
LEB	Mark	5	30	And immediately Jesus , perceiving in himself that power had gone out from himself , turned around in the crowd and [ y ] said , “ Who touched my clothing ? ”
LEB	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said to him , “ You see the crowd pressing upon you , and you say ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
LEB	Mark	5	32	And he was looking around to see the one who had done this .
LEB	Mark	5	33	So the woman , frightened and trembling , knowing what had happened to her , came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth .
LEB	Mark	5	34	But he said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace and be well from your suffering. ”
LEB	Mark	5	35	While [ z ] he was still speaking , they came from the synagogue ruler ’ s house [ aa ] saying , “ Your daughter has died . Why trouble the Teacher further ? ”
LEB	Mark	5	36	But Jesus , ignoring [ ab ] what was said , [ ac ] told the ruler of the synagogue , “ Do not be afraid—only believe ! ”
LEB	Mark	5	37	And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John , the brother of James .
LEB	Mark	5	38	And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion , and people weeping and wailing loudly .
LEB	Mark	5	39	And when he [ ad ] entered , he said to them , “ Why are you agitated and weeping ? The child is not dead , but is sleeping. ”
LEB	Mark	5	40	And they began laughing [ ae ] at him . But he sent them all out and [ af ] took along the father and mother of the child , and those who were with him , and went in to where the child was .
LEB	Mark	5	41	And taking hold of the child ’ s hand , he said to her , “ Talitha koum ! ” ( which is translated , “ Little girl , I say to you , get up ! ” ) ,
LEB	Mark	5	42	and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around [ ag ] ( for she was twelve years old ) . And immediately they were utterly and completely astonished . [ ah ]
LEB	Mark	5	43	And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this , and said to give her something [ ai ] to eat .

LEB	Mark	6	6	And he was astonished because of their unbelief . The Twelve Commissioned and Sent Out And he was going around among the villages teaching .
LEB	Mark	6	2	And when [ a ] the Sabbath came , he began to teach in the synagogue , and many who heard him [ b ] were amazed , saying , “ Where did this man get these things ? And what is this wisdom that has been granted to this man , and the miracles such as these performed through his hands ?
LEB	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? And are not his sisters here with us ? ” And they were offended by him .
LEB	Mark	6	4	And Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown , and among his relatives , and in his own household. ”
LEB	Mark	6	5	And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his [ c ] hands on a few sick people and [ d ] heal them . [ e ]
LEB	Mark	6	7	And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two , and gave them authority over the unclean spirits .
LEB	Mark	6	8	And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread , no traveler ’ s bag , no money in their [ f ] belts—
LEB	Mark	6	9	but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics .
LEB	Mark	6	10	And he said to them , “ Whenever you enter into a house , stay there until you depart from there .
LEB	Mark	6	11	And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you , as you [ g ] go out from there , shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them. ”
LEB	Mark	6	12	And they went out and [ h ] proclaimed that people [ i ] should repent .
LEB	Mark	6	13	And they were expelling many demons and anointing many sick people with olive oil and healing them . [ j ] Herod Kills John the Baptist
LEB	Mark	6	14	And King Herod heard it , [ k ] because his name had become known . And they were saying , “ John , the one who baptizes , has been raised from the dead , and because of this these miraculous powers are at work in him. ”
LEB	Mark	6	15	But others were saying , “ He is Elijah , ” and others were saying , “ He is a prophet like one of the prophets. ”
LEB	Mark	6	16	But when [ l ] Herod heard it , [ m ] he said , “ John whom I beheaded—this one has been raised ! ”
LEB	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent and [ n ] arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias , the wife of Philip his brother , because he had married her .
LEB	Mark	6	18	For John had been saying to Herod , “ It is not permitted for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ”
LEB	Mark	6	19	So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him , and was not able to do so .
LEB	Mark	6	20	For Herod was afraid of John , because he [ o ] knew him to be a righteous and holy man and protected him . And when he [ p ] listened to him , he was greatly perplexed , and yet he listened to him gladly .
LEB	Mark	6	21	And a suitable day came when Herod , on his birthday , gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent men of Galilee .
LEB	Mark	6	22	And when [ q ] the daughter of Herodias herself [ r ] came in and danced and pleased [ s ] Herod and his dinner guests , [ t ] the king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you want , and I will give it [ u ] to you. ”
LEB	Mark	6	23	And he swore to her , [ v ] “ Anything whatever you ask me for I will give you , up to half my kingdom ! ”
LEB	Mark	6	24	And she went out and [ w ] said to her mother , “ What should I ask for ? ” And she said , “ The head of John the baptizer. ”
LEB	Mark	6	25	And she came in immediately with haste to the king and [ x ] asked , saying , “ I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately. ”
LEB	Mark	6	26	And although he [ y ] was deeply grieved , the king , because of his [ z ] oaths and dinner guests , [ aa ] did not want to refuse her .
LEB	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king sent an executioner and [ ab ] ordered him [ ac ] to bring his head . And he went and [ ad ] beheaded him in the prison .
LEB	Mark	6	28	And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl , and the girl gave it to her mother .
LEB	Mark	6	29	And when [ ae ] his disciples heard this , [ af ] they came and took away his corpse and placed it in a tomb . The Feeding of Five Thousand
LEB	Mark	6	30	And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught .
LEB	Mark	6	31	And he said to them , “ You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time. ” For those who were coming and going were many , and they did not even have time to eat .
LEB	Mark	6	32	And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves .
LEB	Mark	6	33	And many people saw them leaving and recognized them , [ ag ] and ran there together by land from all the towns , and arrived ahead of them .
LEB	Mark	6	34	And getting out of the boat [ ah ] he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them , because they were like sheep without [ ai ] a shepherd , and he began to teach them many things .
LEB	Mark	6	35	And the hour had already become late when [ aj ] his disciples came up to him , saying , “ The place is desolate and the hour is already late .
LEB	Mark	6	36	Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages and [ ak ] purchase something to eat for themselves. ”
LEB	Mark	6	37	But he answered and [ al ] said to them , “ You give them something [ am ] to eat. ” And they said to him , “ Should we go and [ an ] purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give it [ ao ] to them to eat ? ”
LEB	Mark	6	38	And he said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go look ! ” And when they [ ap ] found out , they said , “ Five , and two fish. ”
LEB	Mark	6	39	And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass .
LEB	Mark	6	40	And they reclined in groups , by hundreds and by fifties .
LEB	Mark	6	41	And taking the five loaves and the two fish and [ aq ] looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke the loaves and gave them [ ar ] to his disciples so that they could set them [ as ] before them . And he distributed the two fish to them all .
LEB	Mark	6	42	And they all ate and were satisfied .
LEB	Mark	6	43	And they picked up the broken pieces , twelve baskets full , and of the fish .
LEB	Mark	6	44	And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men . Jesus Walks on the Water
LEB	Mark	6	45	And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side , to Bethsaida , while he himself dismissed the crowd .
LEB	Mark	6	46	And after he [ at ] had said farewell to them , he went away to the mountain to pray .
LEB	Mark	6	47	And when [ au ] evening came , the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land .
LEB	Mark	6	48	And he saw them being beaten in their rowing [ av ] because the wind was against them . Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea , and he was wanting to pass by them .
LEB	Mark	6	49	But when [ aw ] they saw him walking on the sea , they thought that it was a ghost , and they cried out .
LEB	Mark	6	50	For they all saw him and were terrified . But immediately he spoke with them and said to them , “ Have courage , I am he ! Do not be afraid ! ”
LEB	Mark	6	51	And he went up with them into the boat , and the wind abated . And they were extraordinarily [ ax ] astounded within themselves ,
LEB	Mark	6	52	because they did not understand concerning the loaves , but their hearts were hardened . Many Healed at Gennesaret
LEB	Mark	6	53	And after they [ ay ] had crossed over , they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there .

LEB	Mark	7	7	And they worship me in vain , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. ’ [ k ]
LEB	Mark	7	2	And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their [ a ] bread with unclean—that is , unwashed—hands .
LEB	Mark	7	3	( For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands ritually , [ b ] thus [ c ] holding fast to the traditions of the elders .
LEB	Mark	7	4	And when they come [ d ] from the marketplace , they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions [ e ] which they have received and [ f ] hold fast to—for example , [ g ] the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches . ) [ h ]
LEB	Mark	7	5	And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , “ Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their [ i ] bread with unclean hands ? ”
LEB	Mark	7	6	So he said to them , “ Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites , as it is written , ‘ This people honors me with their [ j ] lips , but their heart is far , far away from me .
LEB	Mark	7	8	Abandoning the commandment of God , you hold fast to the tradition of men. ”
LEB	Mark	7	9	And he said to them , “ You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can keep [ l ] your tradition .
LEB	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ [ m ] and , ‘ The one who speaks evil of father or mother must certainly die [ n ] . ’ [ o ]
LEB	Mark	7	11	But you say , ‘ If a man says to his [ p ] father or to his [ q ] mother , “ Whatever benefit you would have received [ r ] from me is corban ” [ s ] ( that is , a gift to God ) ,
LEB	Mark	7	12	you no longer permit him to do anything for his [ t ] father or his [ u ] mother ,
LEB	Mark	7	13	thus [ v ] making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down , and you do many similar things such as this. ” Defilement from Within
LEB	Mark	7	14	And summoning the crowd again , he said to them , “ Listen to me , all of you , and understand :
LEB	Mark	7	15	There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by [ w ] going into him . But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person. ” [ x ]
LEB	Mark	7	17	And when he entered into the house away from the crowd , his disciples asked him about the parable .
LEB	Mark	7	18	And he said to them , “ So are you also without understanding ? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him ?
LEB	Mark	7	19	For it does not enter into his heart but into his [ y ] stomach , and goes out into the latrine ” —thus [ z ] declaring all foods clean .
LEB	Mark	7	20	And he said , “ What comes out of a person , that defiles a person .
LEB	Mark	7	21	For from within , from the heart of people , come evil plans , sexual immoralities , thefts , murders ,
LEB	Mark	7	22	adulteries , acts of greed , malicious deeds , deceit , licentiousness , envy , [ aa ] abusive speech , pride , foolishness .
LEB	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from within and defile a person. ” A Syrophoenician Woman ’ s Great Faith
LEB	Mark	7	24	And from there he set out and [ ab ] went to the region of Tyre . And when he [ ac ] entered into a house , he wanted no one to know , and yet he was not able to escape notice .
LEB	Mark	7	25	But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit , when she [ ad ] heard about him , came and [ ae ] fell down at his feet ,
LEB	Mark	7	26	Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter .
LEB	Mark	7	27	And he said to her , “ Let the children be satisfied first , for it is not right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it [ af ] to the dogs ! ”
LEB	Mark	7	28	But she answered and said to him , “ Lord , even the dogs under the table eat the children ’ s crumbs. ”
LEB	Mark	7	29	And he said to her , “ Because of this statement , go ! The demon has gone out of your daughter. ”
LEB	Mark	7	30	And when she [ ag ] went to her home , she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone . A Man Deaf and Unable to Speak Healed
LEB	Mark	7	31	And again he went away from the region of Tyre and [ ah ] came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , within the region of the Decapolis .
LEB	Mark	7	32	And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking , and they were imploring him that he would place his [ ai ] hand on him .
LEB	Mark	7	33	And he took him away from the crowd by himself and [ aj ] put his fingers into his ears , and after [ ak ] spitting , he touched his tongue .
LEB	Mark	7	34	And looking up to heaven , he sighed and said to him , “ Ephphatha ! ” ( that is , “ Be opened ! ” ) .
LEB	Mark	7	35	And [ al ] his ears were opened and his difficulty in speaking was removed [ am ] and he began to speak normally .
LEB	Mark	7	36	And he ordered them that they should say nothing , but as much as he ordered them not to , they proclaimed it [ an ] even more instead .

LEB	Mark	8	6	And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground , and taking the seven loaves , after he [ c ] had given thanks he broke them [ d ] and began giving [ e ] them [ f ] to his disciples so that they could set them [ g ] before them .

LEB	Mark	9	11	And they asked him , saying , “ Why do [ e ] the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
LEB	Mark	9	12	And he said to them , “ Elijah indeed does come first and [ f ] restores all things . And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt ?

LEB	Mark	10	10	And in the house again the disciples began to ask [ m ] him about this .
LEB	Mark	10	2	And they asked [ d ] him if it was permitted for a man to divorce his [ e ] wife , in order to [ f ] test him .
LEB	Mark	10	3	And he answered and [ g ] said to them , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
LEB	Mark	10	4	So they said , “ Moses permitted a man [ h ] to write a certificate of divorce and to send her [ i ] away. ”
LEB	Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them , “ He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart .
LEB	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of creation ‘ he made them male and female . [ j ]
LEB	Mark	10	7	Because of this a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife , [ k ]
LEB	Mark	10	8	and the two will become one flesh , ’ [ l ] so that they are no longer two but one flesh .
LEB	Mark	10	9	Therefore what God has joined together , man must not separate. ”
LEB	Mark	10	11	And he said to them , “ Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her .
LEB	Mark	10	12	And if she divorces her husband and [ n ] marries another , she commits adultery. ” Little Children Brought to Jesus
LEB	Mark	10	13	And they were bringing young children to him so that he could touch them , but the disciples rebuked them .
LEB	Mark	10	14	But when [ o ] Jesus saw it , [ p ] he was indignant , and said to them , “ Let the young children come to me . Do not forbid them , for to such belongs [ q ] the kingdom of God .
LEB	Mark	10	15	Truly I say to you , whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it. ”
LEB	Mark	10	16	And after [ r ] taking them [ s ] into his arms , he blessed them , placing his [ t ] hands on them . A Rich Young Man
LEB	Mark	10	17	And as [ u ] he was setting out on his way , one individual ran up and knelt down before him and [ v ] asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do so that I will inherit eternal life ? ”
LEB	Mark	10	18	So Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
LEB	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not murder , do not commit adultery , do not steal , do not give false testimony , do not defraud , honor your father and mother. ’ ” [ w ]
LEB	Mark	10	20	And he said to him , “ Teacher , all these I have observed from my youth. ”
LEB	Mark	10	21	And Jesus , looking at him , loved him , and said to him , “ You lack one thing : Go , sell all that you have , and give the proceeds [ x ] to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come , follow me. ”
LEB	Mark	10	22	But he looked gloomy at the statement and [ y ] went away sorrowful , because he had [ z ] many possessions .
LEB	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked around and [ aa ] said to his disciples , “ How difficult it is for [ ab ] those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God ! ”
LEB	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astounded at his words . But Jesus answered and [ ac ] said to them again , “ Children , how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God !
LEB	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God. ”
LEB	Mark	10	26	And they were very astounded , saying to one another , “ And who can be saved ? ”
LEB	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and [ ad ] said , “ With human beings it is impossible , but not with God . For all things are possible with God. ”
LEB	Mark	10	28	Peter began to say to him , “ Behold , we have left everything and followed you. ”
LEB	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you , there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields on account of me and on account of the gospel
LEB	Mark	10	30	who will not [ ae ] receive a hundred times as much now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields , together with persecutions—and in the age to come , eternal life .
LEB	Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last , and the last first. ” Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection a Third Time
LEB	Mark	10	32	Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going on ahead of them . And they were astounded , but those who were following him [ af ] were afraid . And taking aside the twelve again , he began to tell them the things that were about to happen to him :
LEB	Mark	10	33	“ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles .
LEB	Mark	10	34	And they will mock him and spit on him and flog him and kill him , [ ag ] and after three days he will rise. ” A Request by James and John
LEB	Mark	10	35	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came up to him and [ ah ] said to him , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask you. ”
LEB	Mark	10	36	And he said to them , “ What do you want that I do [ ai ] for you ? ”
LEB	Mark	10	37	So they said to him , “ Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory. ”
LEB	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking ! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink , or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? ”
LEB	Mark	10	39	And they said to him , “ We are able. ” So Jesus said to them , “ You will drink the cup that I drink , and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ,
LEB	Mark	10	40	but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant , but is for those for whom it has been prepared. ”
LEB	Mark	10	41	And when they [ aj ] heard this , [ ak ] the ten began to be indignant about James and John .
LEB	Mark	10	42	And Jesus called them to himself and [ al ] said to them , “ You know that those who are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them , and their people in high positions exercise authority over them .
LEB	Mark	10	43	But it is not like this among you ! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant ,
LEB	Mark	10	44	and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all .
LEB	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life as a ransom for many. ” A Blind Man Healed at Jericho
LEB	Mark	10	46	And they came to Jericho . And as [ am ] he was setting out from Jericho along with his disciples and a large crowd , a blind beggar , Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus , was sitting beside the road .
LEB	Mark	10	47	And when he [ an ] heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
LEB	Mark	10	48	And many people warned him that he should be quiet . But he was crying out even more loudly , [ ao ] “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
LEB	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stopped and [ ap ] said , “ Call him. ” And they called the blind man and [ aq ] said to him , “ Have courage ! Get up ! He is calling you. ”
LEB	Mark	10	50	And he threw off his cloak , jumped up , and [ ar ] came to Jesus .
LEB	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answered him and [ as ] said , “ What do you want me to do [ at ] for you ? ” And the blind man said to him , “ Rabboni , [ au ] that I may regain my sight. ”
LEB	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said to him , “ Go , your faith has healed you. ” And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow [ av ] him on the road .

LEB	Mark	11	4	And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street , and they untied it .
LEB	Mark	11	5	And some of those who were standing there said to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”

LEB	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it , and he sat on it .
LEB	Mark	11	8	And many people spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread [ e ] leafy branches they [ f ] had cut from the fields .

LEB	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said to him , “ That is true , Teacher . You have said correctly [ aa ] that he is one and there is no other except him .

LEB	Mark	13	3	And as [ c ] he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
LEB	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will these things happen , and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished ? ”
LEB	Mark	13	5	So Jesus began to say to them , “ Watch out that no one deceives you !
LEB	Mark	13	6	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and they will deceive many .
LEB	Mark	13	7	And when you hear about wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed . This must happen , but the end is not yet .

LEB	Mark	13	11	And when they arrest you and [ e ] hand you over , do not be anxious beforehand what you should say , but whatever is given to you at that hour , say this . For you are not the ones who are speaking , but the Holy Spirit .
LEB	Mark	13	12	And brother will hand over brother to death , and a father his [ f ] child , and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death .

LEB	Mark	13	17	And woe to those who are pregnant [ i ] and to those who are nursing their babies [ j ] in those days !
LEB	Mark	13	18	But pray that it will not happen in winter .
LEB	Mark	13	19	For in those days there will be tribulation of such a kind as has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until now , and never will happen .
LEB	Mark	13	20	And if the Lord had not shortened the days , no human being would be saved . [ k ] But for the sake of the elect , whom he chose , he has shortened the days .

LEB	Mark	14	4	But some were expressing indignation to one another : [ g ] “ Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil ?
LEB	Mark	14	5	For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor ! ” And they began to scold [ h ] her .
LEB	Mark	14	6	But Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Why do you cause trouble for her ? She has done a good deed to me .
LEB	Mark	14	7	For the poor you always have with you , and you can do good for them whenever you want , but you do not always have me .

LEB	Mark	14	18	And while [ r ] they were reclining at table and eating , Jesus said , “ Truly I say to you , that one of you who is eating with me will betray me. ”
LEB	Mark	14	19	They began to be distressed and to say to him one by one , “ Surely not I ? ” [ s ]
LEB	Mark	14	20	But he said to them , “ It is one of the twelve—the one who is dipping bread [ t ] into the bowl with me .

LEB	Mark	14	28	But after I am raised , I will go ahead of you into Galilee. ”
LEB	Mark	14	29	But Peter said to him , “ Even if they all fall away , certainly I will not ! ”
LEB	Mark	14	30	And Jesus said to him , “ Truly I say to you that today—this night—before the rooster crows twice , you will deny me three times ! ”

LEB	Mark	14	34	And he said to them , “ My soul is deeply grieved , to the point of death . Remain here and stay awake. ”
LEB	Mark	14	35	And going forward a little he fell to the ground and began to pray [ ag ] that , if it were possible , the hour would pass from him .
LEB	Mark	14	36	And he said , “ Abba , [ ah ] Father , all things are possible for you ! Take away this cup from me ! Yet not what I will , but what you will. ” [ ai ]
LEB	Mark	14	37	And he came and found them sleeping , and he said to Peter , “ Simon , are you sleeping ? Were you not able to stay awake one hour ?
LEB	Mark	14	38	Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation . The spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak ! ”
LEB	Mark	14	39	And again he went away and [ aj ] prayed , saying the same thing .
LEB	Mark	14	40	And again he came and [ ak ] found them sleeping , for they could not keep their eyes open , [ al ] and they did not know what to reply to him .
LEB	Mark	14	41	And he came the third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and resting ? It is enough ! The hour has come . Behold , the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners .

LEB	Mark	14	45	And when he [ ap ] arrived , he came up to him immediately and [ aq ] said , “ Rabbi , ” and kissed him .
LEB	Mark	14	46	So they laid hands on him and arrested him .
LEB	Mark	14	47	But a certain one of the bystanders , drawing his [ ar ] sword , struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear .
LEB	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answered and [ as ] said to them , “ Have you come out with swords and clubs , as against a robber , to arrest me ?
LEB	Mark	14	49	Every day I was with you in the temple courts [ at ] teaching , and you did not arrest me ! But this has happened [ au ] in order that the scriptures would be fulfilled .
LEB	Mark	14	50	And they all abandoned him and [ av ] fled .

LEB	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed him from a distance , right inside , into the courtyard of the high priest . And he was sitting with the officers and warming himself by the fire .
LEB	Mark	14	55	Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death , and they did not find it . [ ay ]
LEB	Mark	14	56	For many gave false testimony against him , and their [ az ] testimony was not consistent .

LEB	Mark	14	58	“ We heard him saying , ‘ I will destroy this temple made by hands , and within three days I will build another not made by hands. ”
LEB	Mark	14	59	And their testimony was not even consistent about this .
LEB	Mark	14	60	And the high priest stood up in the midst of them and [ bc ] asked Jesus , saying , “ Do you not reply anything ? What are these people testifying against you ? ”
LEB	Mark	14	61	But he was silent and did not reply anything . Again the high priest asked him and said to him , “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed One ? ”
LEB	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , “ I am , and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power [ bd ] and coming with the clouds of heaven. ”
LEB	Mark	14	63	And the high priest tore his clothes and [ be ] said , “ What further need do we have of witnesses ?
LEB	Mark	14	64	You have heard the blasphemy ! What do you think ? ” [ bf ] And they all condemned him as deserving death . [ bg ]
LEB	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists , and to say to him “ Prophesy ! ” And the officers received him with slaps in the face . [ bh ] Peter Denies Jesus Three Times
LEB	Mark	14	66	And while [ bi ] Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the female slaves of the high priest came up

LEB	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , [ bl ] saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you mean ! ” And he went out into the gateway , and a rooster crowed . [ bm ]
LEB	Mark	14	69	And the female slave , when she [ bn ] saw him , began to say again to the bystanders , “ This man is one of them ! ”
LEB	Mark	14	70	But he denied it [ bo ] again . And after a little while , again the bystanders began to say [ bp ] to Peter , “ You really are one of them , because you also are a Galilean , and your accent shows it ! ” [ bq ] [ br ]
LEB	Mark	14	71	And he began to curse and to swear with an oath , “ I do not know this man whom you are talking about ! ”
LEB	Mark	14	72	And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time .

LEB	Luke	1	1	Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the events that have been fulfilled among us ,
LEB	Luke	1	2	just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning passed on to us ,
LEB	Luke	1	3	it seemed best to me also—because I [ a ] have followed all things carefully from the beginning—to write them [ b ] down in orderly sequence for you , most excellent Theophilus ,
LEB	Luke	1	4	so that you may know the certainty concerning the things about which you were taught . The Prediction of John the Baptist ’ s Birth
LEB	Luke	1	5	It happened that in the days of Herod , king of Judea , there was a certain priest , Zechariah by name , of the division of Abijah . And he had a wife [ c ] from the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth .
LEB	Luke	1	6	And they were both righteous in the sight of God , living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord .
LEB	Luke	1	7	And they did not have [ d ] a child , because Elizabeth was barren . And they were both advanced in years . [ e ]
LEB	Luke	1	8	And it happened that while [ f ] he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division ,
LEB	Luke	1	9	according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense .
LEB	Luke	1	10	And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering .
LEB	Luke	1	11	And an angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing at the right side of the altar of incense .
LEB	Luke	1	12	And Zechariah was terrified when he [ g ] saw the angel , [ h ] and fear fell upon him .
LEB	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ Do not be afraid , Zechariah , because your prayer has been heard , and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you will call his name John .
LEB	Luke	1	14	And you will experience joy and exultation , [ i ] and many will rejoice at his birth .
LEB	Luke	1	15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord , and he must never drink wine or beer , and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while he is [ j ] still in his mother ’ s womb .
LEB	Luke	1	16	And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God .
LEB	Luke	1	17	And he will go on before him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous , to prepare for the Lord a people made ready. ”
LEB	Luke	1	18	And Zechariah said to the angel , “ By what will I know this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is advanced in years ! ” [ k ]
LEB	Luke	1	19	And the angel answered and [ l ] said to him , “ I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God , and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news .
LEB	Luke	1	20	And behold , you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place , because [ m ] you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled in their time. ”
LEB	Luke	1	21	And the people were waiting for Zechariah , and began to wonder [ n ] when [ o ] he was delayed in the temple .
LEB	Luke	1	22	And when he [ p ] came out he was not able to speak to them , and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple . And he kept making signs to them , and remained unable to speak .
LEB	Luke	1	23	And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end , he went away to his home .
LEB	Luke	1	24	Now after these days , his wife Elizabeth conceived , and she kept herself in seclusion for five months , saying ,
LEB	Luke	1	25	“ Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me , [ q ] to take away my disgrace among people. ” The Prediction of Jesus ’ Birth
LEB	Luke	1	26	Now in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee named [ r ] Nazareth ,
LEB	Luke	1	27	to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man named [ s ] Joseph of the house of David . And the name of the virgin was Mary .
LEB	Luke	1	28	And he came to her and [ t ] said , “ Greetings , favored one ! The Lord is with you. ”
LEB	Luke	1	29	But she was greatly perplexed at the statement , and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be .
LEB	Luke	1	30	And the angel said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
LEB	Luke	1	31	And behold , you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son , and you will call his name Jesus .
LEB	Luke	1	32	This one will be great , and he will be called the Son of the Most High , and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David .
LEB	Luke	1	33	And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever , [ u ] and of his kingdom there will be no end .
LEB	Luke	1	34	And Mary said to the angel , “ How will this be , since I have not had sexual relations with a man ? ”
LEB	Luke	1	35	And the angel answered and [ v ] said to her , “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you . Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy , the Son of God .
LEB	Luke	1	36	And behold , your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age , and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren .
LEB	Luke	1	37	For nothing will be impossible with God. ” [ w ]
LEB	Luke	1	38	So Mary said , “ Behold , the Lord ’ s female slave ! May it happen to me according to your word. ” And the angel departed from her . Mary Visits Elizabeth
LEB	Luke	1	39	Now in those days Mary set out and [ x ] traveled with haste into the hill country , to a town of Judah ,
LEB	Luke	1	40	and entered into the house of Zechariah , and greeted Elizabeth .
LEB	Luke	1	41	And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary , the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
LEB	Luke	1	42	And she cried out with a loud shout and said , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
LEB	Luke	1	43	And why is this granted to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
LEB	Luke	1	44	For behold , when the sound of your greeting came to my ears , the baby in my womb leaped for joy !
LEB	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord ! ” Mary ’ s Hymn of Praise to God
LEB	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , “ My soul exalts the Lord ,
LEB	Luke	1	47	and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior ,
LEB	Luke	1	48	because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave , for behold , from now on all generations will consider me blessed ,
LEB	Luke	1	49	because the Mighty One has done great things for me , and holy is his name .
LEB	Luke	1	50	And his mercy is for generation after generation to those who fear him .
LEB	Luke	1	51	He has done a mighty deed with his arm ; he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts .
LEB	Luke	1	52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones , and has exalted the lowly .
LEB	Luke	1	53	He has filled those who are hungry with good things , and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed .
LEB	Luke	1	54	He has helped Israel his servant , remembering his mercy ,
LEB	Luke	1	55	just as he spoke to our fathers , to Abraham and to his descendants forever. ” [ y ]
LEB	Luke	1	56	And Mary stayed with her about three months , and returned to her home . The Birth of John the Baptist
LEB	Luke	1	57	Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth , and she gave birth to a son .
LEB	Luke	1	58	And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her , [ z ] and they rejoiced with her .
LEB	Luke	1	59	And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they were wanting to name him after [ aa ] his father Zechariah .
LEB	Luke	1	60	And his mother answered and [ ab ] said , “ No , but he will be named John. ”
LEB	Luke	1	61	And they said to her , “ There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name. ”
LEB	Luke	1	62	So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named ,
LEB	Luke	1	63	and he asked for a writing tablet and [ ac ] wrote , saying , “ John is his name. ” And they were all astonished .
LEB	Luke	1	64	And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately , and he began to speak , [ ad ] praising God .
LEB	Luke	1	65	And fear came on all those who lived near them , and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed .
LEB	Luke	1	66	And all those who heard kept these things [ ae ] in their hearts , saying , “ What then will this child be ? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him ! ” The Praise and Prophecy of Zechariah
LEB	Luke	1	67	And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied , saying ,
LEB	Luke	1	68	“ Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , because he has visited to help and has redeemed [ af ] his people ,
LEB	Luke	1	69	and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ,
LEB	Luke	1	70	just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times—

LEB	Luke	5	5	And Simon answered and [ f ] said , “ Master , although we [ g ] worked hard through the whole night , we caught nothing . But at your word I will let down the nets. ”
LEB	Luke	5	2	and he saw two boats there beside the lake , but the fishermen had gotten out of them and [ b ] were washing their nets .
LEB	Luke	5	3	And he got into one of the boats , which was Simon ’ s , and [ c ] asked him to put out from the land a little . And he sat down and [ d ] began to teach [ e ] the crowds from the boat .
LEB	Luke	5	4	And when he stopped speaking , he said to Simon , “ Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch. ”
LEB	Luke	5	6	And when they [ h ] did this , they caught a very large number of fish , and their nets began to tear . [ i ]
LEB	Luke	5	7	And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and [ j ] help them , and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink .
LEB	Luke	5	8	And when he [ k ] saw it , [ l ] Simon Peter fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , “ Depart from me , Lord , because I am a sinful man ! ” [ m ]
LEB	Luke	5	9	For amazement had seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fish that they had caught ,
LEB	Luke	5	10	and so also were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were business partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , “ Do not be afraid ! From now on you will be catching people ! ”
LEB	Luke	5	11	And after they [ n ] brought their [ o ] boats to the land , they left everything and [ p ] followed him . A Leper Cleansed
LEB	Luke	5	12	And it happened that while he was in one of the towns , there was [ q ] a man covered with leprosy . [ r ] And when he [ s ] saw Jesus , he fell down on his face and [ t ] begged him , saying , “ Lord , if you are willing , you are able to make me clean. ”
LEB	Luke	5	13	And extending his [ u ] hand he touched him , saying , “ I am willing ; be clean. ” And immediately the leprosy went away from him .
LEB	Luke	5	14	And he ordered him , “ Tell no one , but go and [ v ] show yourself to the priest and bring the offering [ w ] for your cleansing just as Moses commanded , for a testimony to them .
LEB	Luke	5	15	But the report about him spread even more , and large crowds were gathering to hear him [ x ] and to be healed of their illnesses .
LEB	Luke	5	16	But he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness and praying . A Paralytic Healed
LEB	Luke	5	17	And it happened that on one of the days as he was teaching , Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come [ y ] from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem , and the power of the Lord was there in order for him to heal .
LEB	Luke	5	18	And behold , men came carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed , and they were seeking to bring him in and place him [ z ] [ aa ] before him .
LEB	Luke	5	19	And when they [ ab ] did not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and [ ac ] let him down through the roof tiles with the stretcher into the midst of them , in front of Jesus .
LEB	Luke	5	20	And when he [ ad ] saw their faith , he said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven you. ”
LEB	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , “ Who is this man who speaks blasphemies ? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone ? ”
LEB	Luke	5	22	But Jesus , perceiving their thoughts , answered and [ ae ] said to them , “ Why are you reasoning in your hearts ?
LEB	Luke	5	23	Which is easier to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say , ‘ Get up and walk ? ’
LEB	Luke	5	24	But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins , ” he said to the one who was paralyzed , “ I say to you , ‘ Get up and pick up your stretcher and [ af ] go to your home. ’ ”
LEB	Luke	5	25	And immediately he stood up before them , picked up what he had been lying on , and [ ag ] went away to his home , glorifying God .
LEB	Luke	5	26	And amazement seized them all , and they began to glorify [ ah ] God . And they were filled with fear , saying , “ We have seen wonderful things today ! ” Levi Called to Follow Jesus
LEB	Luke	5	27	And after these things , he went out and saw a tax collector named [ ai ] Levi sitting at the tax booth , and he said to him , “ Follow me ! ”
LEB	Luke	5	28	And leaving everything behind , he got up and [ aj ] began to follow [ ak ] him .
LEB	Luke	5	29	And Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house , and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining for the meal with them .
LEB	Luke	5	30	And the Pharisees and their scribes began to complain [ al ] to his disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? ”
LEB	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answered and [ am ] said to them , “ Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician , but those who are sick . [ an ]
LEB	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. ” On Fasting
LEB	Luke	5	33	And they said to him , “ The disciples of John fast often and make prayers—likewise also the disciples [ ao ] of the Pharisees—but yours are eating and drinking ! ”
LEB	Luke	5	34	So he [ ap ] said [ aq ] to them , “ You are not able to make the bridegroom ’ s attendants [ ar ] fast as long as the bridegroom is with them , are you ? [ as ]
LEB	Luke	5	35	But days will come , and when the bridegroom is taken away from them , then they will fast in those days. ”
LEB	Luke	5	36	And he also told a parable to them : “ No one tears a patch from a new garment and [ at ] puts it [ au ] on an old garment . Otherwise , he will have torn the new also , and the old will not match the patch that is from the new .
LEB	Luke	5	37	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the new wine will burst the wineskins , and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed .
LEB	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into new wineskins .

LEB	Luke	6	6	Now it happened that on another Sabbath he entered into the synagogue and was teaching , and a man was there , and his right hand was withered .
LEB	Luke	6	2	But some of the Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath ?
LEB	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answered and [ c ] said to them , “ Have you not read this , what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry—
LEB	Luke	6	4	how he entered into the house of God and took the bread of the presentation , which it is not permitted to eat ( except the priests alone ) , and [ d ] ate it [ e ] and gave it [ f ] to those with him ? ”
LEB	Luke	6	5	And he said to them , “ The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ” A Man with a Withered Hand Healed
LEB	Luke	6	7	So the scribes and the Pharisees were watching closely [ g ] to see if he would heal on the Sabbath , in order that they could find a reason [ h ] to accuse him .
LEB	Luke	6	8	But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand , “ Get up and stand in the middle , ” and he got up and [ i ] stood there .
LEB	Luke	6	9	And Jesus said to them , “ I ask you whether it is permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save a life or to destroy it ? ” [ j ]
LEB	Luke	6	10	And after [ k ] looking around at them all , he said to him , “ Stretch out your hand , ” and he did , and his hand was restored .

LEB	Luke	6	12	Now it happened that in these days he went away to the mountain to pray , and was spending the whole night in prayer to God .
LEB	Luke	6	13	And when day came , he summoned his disciples and chose from them twelve , whom he also named apostles :
LEB	Luke	6	14	Simon ( whom he also named Peter ) and his brother Andrew , and James , and John , and Philip , and Bartholomew ,

LEB	Luke	6	17	And he came down with them and [ m ] stood on a level place , and a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all of Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast district of Tyre and Sidon ,
LEB	Luke	6	18	who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases , and those who were troubled by unclean spirits were cured .
LEB	Luke	6	19	And the whole crowd was seeking to touch him , because power was going out from him and healing them all .
LEB	Luke	6	20	And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples and [ n ] said , “ Blessed are the poor , because yours is the kingdom of God .
LEB	Luke	6	21	Blessed are those who are hungry now , because you will be satisfied . Blessed are those who weep now , Because you will laugh .
LEB	Luke	6	22	Blessed are you when people hate you , and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil on account of the Son of Man .
LEB	Luke	6	23	Rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven . For their fathers used to do the same things to the prophets . The Sermon on the Plain : Woes

LEB	Luke	6	25	Woe to you who are satisfied now , because you will be hungry . Woe , you who laugh now , because you will mourn and weep .

LEB	Luke	6	28	bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .

LEB	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who asks you , and from the one who takes away your things , do not ask for them back . [ o ]

LEB	Luke	6	33	And if [ r ] you do good to those who do good to you , what kind of credit is that to you ? Even the sinners do the same !
LEB	Luke	6	34	And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back , what kind of credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , so that they may get back an equal amount !
LEB	Luke	6	35	But love your enemies , and do good , and lend expecting back nothing , and your reward will be great , and you will be sons of the Most High , because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked .

LEB	Luke	6	38	Give , and it will be given to you , a good measure—pressed down , shaken , overflowing—they will pour out into your lap . For with the measure by which you measure out , it will be measured out to you in return. ”
LEB	Luke	6	39	And he also told them a parable : “ Surely a blind person can not lead the blind , can he ? [ t ] Will they not both fall into a pit ?

LEB	Luke	6	43	“ For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit , nor on the other hand a bad tree that produces good fruit ,
LEB	Luke	6	44	for each tree is known by its own fruit . For figs are not gathered from thorn plants , nor are grapes harvested from thorn bushes .
LEB	Luke	6	45	The good person out of the good treasury of his heart brings forth good , and the evil person out of his [ x ] evil treasury [ y ] brings forth evil . For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks .

LEB	Luke	7	7	For this reason neither did I consider myself worthy to come to you . But say the word and my slave must be healed .
LEB	Luke	7	2	Now a certain centurion ’ s slave , who was esteemed by him , was sick [ a ] and [ b ] was about to die .
LEB	Luke	7	3	So when he [ c ] heard about Jesus , he sent Jewish elders to him , asking him that he would come and [ d ] cure his slave .
LEB	Luke	7	4	And when they [ e ] came to Jesus , they began imploring [ f ] him earnestly , saying , “ He is worthy that you grant this for him ,
LEB	Luke	7	5	because he loves our nation and he himself built the synagogue for us. ”
LEB	Luke	7	6	So Jesus went with them . Now by this time he was not far away from the house , and [ g ] the centurion sent friends , saying to him , “ Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof .
LEB	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man placed under authority , who has soldiers under me , and I say to this one , ‘ Go ! ’ and he goes , and to another one , ‘ Come ! ’ and he comes , and to my slave , ‘ Do this ! ’ and he does it. ” [ h ]
LEB	Luke	7	9	And when [ i ] Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turning around to the crowd that was following him , he said , “ I tell you , not even in Israel have I found such great faith ! ”
LEB	Luke	7	10	And when they [ j ] returned to the house , those who had been sent found the slave healthy . A Widow ’ s Son Raised
LEB	Luke	7	11	And it happened that on the next day he went to a town called Nain , and his disciples and a large crowd went with him .
LEB	Luke	7	12	And as he approached the gate of the town , behold , a man who had died was being carried out , his mother ’ s only son , and she was a widow . And a large crowd from the town was with her .
LEB	Luke	7	13	And when [ k ] the Lord saw her , he had compassion for her and said to her , “ Do not weep ! ”
LEB	Luke	7	14	And he came up and [ l ] touched the bier , and those who were carrying it [ m ] stopped . And he said , “ Young man , I say to you , get up ! ”
LEB	Luke	7	15	And the dead man sat up and began to speak , and he gave him to his mother .
LEB	Luke	7	16	And fear seized them all , and they began to glorify [ n ] God , saying , “ A great prophet has appeared among us ! ” and “ God has visited to help his people ! ”
LEB	Luke	7	17	And this report about him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region . A Question from John the Baptist
LEB	Luke	7	18	And his disciples reported to John about all these things . And summoning a certain two of his disciples , John
LEB	Luke	7	19	sent them [ o ] to the Lord , [ p ] saying , “ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ”
LEB	Luke	7	20	And when [ q ] the men came to him , they said , “ John the Baptist sent us to you , saying , ‘ Are you the one who is to come , or should we look for another ? ’ ”
LEB	Luke	7	21	In that hour he healed many people of diseases and suffering and evil spirits , and he granted sight to many blind people .
LEB	Luke	7	22	And he answered and [ r ] said to them , “ Go and [ s ] tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive sight , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear ; [ t ] the dead are raised , the poor have good news announced to them . [ u ]
LEB	Luke	7	23	And whoever is not offended by me is blessed. ”
LEB	Luke	7	24	And when [ v ] the messengers of John had departed , he began to speak to the crowds concerning John : “ What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken by the wind ?
LEB	Luke	7	25	But what did you go out to see ? A man dressed in soft clothing ? Behold , those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces .
LEB	Luke	7	26	But what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and even more than a prophet !
LEB	Luke	7	27	It is this man about whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I am sending my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you. ’ [ w ]
LEB	Luke	7	28	I tell you , there is no one greater among those born of women than John , but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
LEB	Luke	7	29	( And all the people , when they [ x ] heard this [ y ] —even the tax collectors—affirmed the righteousness of God , because they [ z ] had been baptized with the baptism of John ,
LEB	Luke	7	30	but the Pharisees and the legal experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves , because they [ aa ] had not been baptized by him . )
LEB	Luke	7	31	“ To what then shall I compare the people of this generation , and what are they like ?
LEB	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another , who say , ‘ We played the flute for you and you did not dance ; we sang a lament and you did not weep. ’
LEB	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist has come not eating bread or drinking wine , and you say , ‘ He has a demon ! ’
LEB	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ‘ Behold , a man who is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ’
LEB	Luke	7	35	And wisdom is vindicated by all her children. ” A Sinful Woman Anoints Jesus ’ Feet
LEB	Luke	7	36	Now one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him , and he entered into the house of the Pharisee and [ ab ] reclined at the table .
LEB	Luke	7	37	And behold , a woman in the town who was a sinner , when she [ ac ] learned that he was dining in the Pharisee ’ s house , brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil ,
LEB	Luke	7	38	and standing behind him at his feet weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears and was wiping them [ ad ] with the hair of her head and was kissing his feet and anointing them [ ae ] with the perfumed oil .
LEB	Luke	7	39	Now when [ af ] the Pharisee who invited him saw this , [ ag ] he spoke to himself , saying , “ If this man were a prophet , he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him , that she is a sinner. ”
LEB	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answered and [ ah ] said to him , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” And he said , “ Teacher , say it. ” [ ai ]
LEB	Luke	7	41	“ There were two debtors who owed a certain creditor . One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty .
LEB	Luke	7	42	When [ aj ] they were not able to repay him , [ ak ] he forgave the debts [ al ] of both . Now which of them will love him more ? ”
LEB	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and [ am ] said , “ I suppose that it is the one to whom he forgave more. ” And he said to him , “ You have judged correctly. ”
LEB	Luke	7	44	And turning toward the woman , he said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered into your house . You did not give me water for my feet , but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them [ an ] with her hair .
LEB	Luke	7	45	You did not give me a kiss , but from the time I entered , she has not stopped kissing my feet .
LEB	Luke	7	46	You did not anoint my head with olive oil , but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil .
LEB	Luke	7	47	For this reason [ ao ] I tell you , her sins—which were many—have been forgiven , for she loved much . But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little. ”
LEB	Luke	7	48	And he said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
LEB	Luke	7	49	And those who were reclining at the table with him began to say among themselves , “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ”
LEB	Luke	7	50	And he said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you . Go in peace. ” Footnotes - Luke 7:2 Literally “ was having badly ” - Luke 7:2 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ was having ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 7:3 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ heard ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 7:3 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ come ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 7:4 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ came ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 7:4 The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ( “ began imploring ” ) - Luke 7:6 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ away ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 7:8 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 7:9 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ heard ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 7:10 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ returned ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 7:13 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ saw ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 7:14 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ came up ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 7:14 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 7:16 The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ( “ began to glorify ” ) - Luke 7:19 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 7:19 A number of significant manuscripts read “ Jesus ” - Luke 7:20 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ came ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 7:22 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ answered ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 7:22 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ go ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 7:22 Some manuscripts have “ and the deaf hear ” - Luke 7:22 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 7:24 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ had departed ” ) - Luke 7:27 A quotation from Mal 3:1 ; cf .

LEB	Luke	8	8	And other seed fell on the good soil , and when it [ g ] came up , it produced a hundred times as much grain. ” As he [ h ] said these things , he called out , “ The one who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ” The Reason for the Parables
LEB	Luke	8	2	and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases : Mary ( who was called Magdalene ) , from whom seven demons had gone out ,
LEB	Luke	8	3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza ( Herod ’ s household manager ) , and Susanna , and many others who were helping to support them from their possessions . The Parable of the Sower
LEB	Luke	8	4	And while [ b ] a large crowd was gathering and they were going to him from town after town , he spoke by means of a parable :
LEB	Luke	8	5	“ The sower went out to sow his seed , and while he was sowing , some seed [ c ] fell on the side of the path and was trampled under foot , and the birds of the sky devoured it .
LEB	Luke	8	6	And other seed fell on the rock , and when it [ d ] came up , it withered , because it did not have moisture .
LEB	Luke	8	7	And other seed fell in the midst of the thorn plants , and the thorn plants grew up with it [ e ] and [ f ] choked it .
LEB	Luke	8	9	And his disciples asked him what this parable meant .
LEB	Luke	8	10	And he said , “ To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest they are in parables , so that ‘ Seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand. ’ [ i ] The Parable of the Sower Interpreted
LEB	Luke	8	11	Now the parable means this : the seed is the word of God ,
LEB	Luke	8	12	and those beside the path are the ones who have heard . Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart , so that they may not believe and [ j ] be saved .
LEB	Luke	8	13	And those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy when they hear it , [ k ] and these do not have enough root , who believe for a time and in a time of testing fall away .
LEB	Luke	8	14	And the seed that fell into the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear and as they [ l ] go along are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life , and they do not bear fruit to maturity .
LEB	Luke	8	15	But the seed on the good soil—these are the ones who , after [ m ] hearing the word , hold fast to it [ n ] with a noble and good heart , and bear fruit with patient endurance . The Parable of the Lamp
LEB	Luke	8	16	“ And no one , after [ o ] lighting a lamp , covers it with a jar or puts it [ p ] under a bed , but puts it [ q ] on a lampstand , so that those who come in can see the light .
LEB	Luke	8	17	For nothing is secret that will not become evident , and nothing hidden that will never be known and come to light .
LEB	Luke	8	18	Therefore consider how you listen , for whoever has , to him more will be given , and whoever does not have , even what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him. ” Jesus ’ Mother and Brothers
LEB	Luke	8	19	Now his mother and brothers came to him , and they were not able to meet with him because of the crowd .
LEB	Luke	8	20	And it was reported to him , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you. ”
LEB	Luke	8	21	But he answered and [ r ] said to them , “ These are my mother and my brothers—the ones who hear the word of God and do it . [ s ] Calming of a Storm
LEB	Luke	8	22	Now it happened that on one of the days both he and his disciples got into a boat , and he said to them , “ Let us cross over to the other side of the lake. ” And they set sail ,
LEB	Luke	8	23	and as [ t ] they were sailing , he fell asleep . And a storm of wind came down on the lake , and they were being swamped and were in danger .
LEB	Luke	8	24	And they came and [ u ] woke him up , saying , “ Master , master ! We are perishing ! ” So he got up and [ v ] rebuked the wind and the billowing waves of water and they ceased , and it became calm .
LEB	Luke	8	25	And he said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” But they were afraid and [ w ] were astonished , saying to one another , “ Who then is this , that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him ? ” A Demon-possessed Gerasene Healed
LEB	Luke	8	26	And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
LEB	Luke	8	27	And as [ x ] he got out on the land , a certain man from the town met him [ y ] who had demons and for a considerable time had not worn clothes and did not live in a house , but among the tombs .
LEB	Luke	8	28	And when he [ z ] saw Jesus , he cried out , fell down before him , and said with a loud voice , “ What do I have to do with you , [ aa ] Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I beg you , do not torment me ! ”
LEB	Luke	8	29	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . ( For it had seized him many times , and he was bound with chains and shackles and [ ab ] was guarded , and breaking the bonds he would be driven by the demon into the deserted places . )
LEB	Luke	8	30	So Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” And he said , “ Legion , ” because many demons had entered into him .
LEB	Luke	8	31	And they began imploring [ ac ] him that he would not order them to depart into the abyss .
LEB	Luke	8	32	Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the hill , and they implored him that he would permit them to enter into those pigs . And he permitted them .
LEB	Luke	8	33	So the demons came out of the man and [ ad ] entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned .
LEB	Luke	8	34	And when [ ae ] the herdsmen saw what had happened , they fled and reported it [ af ] in the town and in the countryside .
LEB	Luke	8	35	So they went out to see what had happened , and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting there clothed and in his right mind , at the feet of Jesus , and they were afraid .
LEB	Luke	8	36	And those who had seen it [ ag ] reported to them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed .
LEB	Luke	8	37	And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them , because they had been seized with great fear . So he got into the boat and [ ah ] returned .
LEB	Luke	8	38	And the man from who the demons had gone out was begging him to stay with him , but he sent him away , saying ,
LEB	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your home and tell all that God has done for you. ” And he went away , proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Jesus had done for him . A Woman Healed and a Daughter Raised
LEB	Luke	8	40	Now when Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , because they were all waiting for him .
LEB	Luke	8	41	And behold , a man who was named [ ai ] Jairus came , and this man was a ruler of the synagogue . And he fell down at the feet of Jesus and [ aj ] began imploring [ ak ] him to come to his house ,
LEB	Luke	8	42	because he had [ al ] an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . Now as he was going , the crowds were pressing against him .
LEB	Luke	8	43	And a woman who was suffering from hemorrhages [ am ] for twelve years ( who , although she [ an ] had spent all her [ ao ] assets on physicians , was not able to be healed by anyone )
LEB	Luke	8	44	came up behind him and [ ap ] touched the edge of his cloak , and immediately her hemorrhaging [ aq ] stopped .
LEB	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , “ Who is the one who touched me ? ” And when they [ ar ] all denied it , [ as ] Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are pressing you hard and crowding you ! ” [ at ]
LEB	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me , because I know power has gone out from me. ”
LEB	Luke	8	47	And when [ au ] the woman saw that she did not escape notice , she came trembling and falling down before him . In the presence of all the people , she told for what reason she had touched him , and that she was healed immediately .
LEB	Luke	8	48	And he said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has saved you . Go in peace. ”
LEB	Luke	8	49	While [ av ] he was still speaking , someone came from the synagogue ruler ’ s house , saying , “ Your daughter is dead ! Trouble the Teacher no longer ! ”
LEB	Luke	8	50	But Jesus , when he [ aw ] heard this , [ ax ] replied to him , “ Do not be afraid ! Only believe , and she will be healed. ”
LEB	Luke	8	51	Now when he [ ay ] came to the house , he did not allow anyone to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father and mother of the child .
LEB	Luke	8	52	And they were all weeping and mourning for her , but he said , “ Do not weep ! For she is not dead , but is sleeping. ”
LEB	Luke	8	53	And they began laughing [ az ] at him , because they [ ba ] knew that she was dead .
LEB	Luke	8	54	But he took her hand and [ bb ] called , saying , “ Child , get up. ”
LEB	Luke	8	55	And her spirit returned , and she got up immediately , and he ordered something [ bc ] to be given to her to eat .
LEB	Luke	8	56	And her parents were astonished , but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened .

LEB	Luke	9	9	And Herod said , “ John I beheaded , but who is this about whom I hear such things ? ” And he was wanting to see him . The Feeding of Five Thousand
LEB	Luke	9	2	and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick .
LEB	Luke	9	3	And he said to them , “ Take along nothing for the journey—neither a staff , nor a traveler ’ s bag , nor bread , nor money , nor to have two tunics apiece .
LEB	Luke	9	4	And into whatever house you enter , stay there and depart from there .
LEB	Luke	9	5	And as for all those who do not welcome you—when you [ a ] depart from that town , shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them. ”
LEB	Luke	9	6	So they departed and [ b ] went throughout the villages , proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere . Herod Perplexed About Jesus
LEB	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening , and he was greatly perplexed , because it was said by some that John has been raised from the dead ,
LEB	Luke	9	8	and by some that Elijah had appeared , and others that some prophet of ancient times had risen .
LEB	Luke	9	10	And when they [ c ] returned , the apostles described to him all that they had done . And he took them along and [ d ] withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida .
LEB	Luke	9	11	But when [ e ] the crowds found out , they followed him , and welcoming them , he began to speak [ f ] to them about the kingdom of God , and he cured those who had need of healing .
LEB	Luke	9	12	Now the day began to be far spent , and the twelve came up and [ g ] said to him , “ Send away the crowd so that they can go into the surrounding villages and farms to obtain lodging and find provisions , because we are here in a desolate place .
LEB	Luke	9	13	But he said to them , “ You give them something to eat ! ” And they said , “ We have no [ h ] more than five loaves and two fish , unless perhaps we go and [ i ] purchase food for all these people. ”
LEB	Luke	9	14	( For there were about five thousand men . ) So he said to his disciples , “ Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each. ”
LEB	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and had them all sit down .
LEB	Luke	9	16	And taking the five loaves and the two fish , and [ j ] looking up to heaven , he gave thanks and broke them and began giving [ k ] them [ l ] to the disciples to set before the crowd .
LEB	Luke	9	17	And they all ate and were satisfied , and what was left over was picked up by them—twelve baskets of broken pieces . Peter ’ s Confession
LEB	Luke	9	18	And it happened that while he was praying alone , the disciples were with him . And he asked them , saying , “ Who do the crowds say that I am ? ”
LEB	Luke	9	19	And they answered and [ m ] said , “ John the Baptist , but others , Elijah , and others , that one of the ancient prophets has risen. ”
LEB	Luke	9	20	And he said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” And Peter answered and [ n ] said , “ The Christ of God. ” Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection
LEB	Luke	9	21	But he warned and [ o ] commanded them to tell this to no one ,
LEB	Luke	9	22	saying , “ It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes , and to be killed , and to be raised on the third day . Taking Up One ’ s Cross to Follow Jesus
LEB	Luke	9	23	And he said to them all , “ If anyone wants to come after me , he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me .
LEB	Luke	9	24	For whoever wants to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life on account of me , this person will save it .
LEB	Luke	9	25	For what is a person benefited if he [ p ] gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself ?
LEB	Luke	9	26	For whoever is ashamed of me and my words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the glory [ q ] of the Father and of the holy angels .
LEB	Luke	9	27	But I tell you truly , there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God. ” The Transfiguration
LEB	Luke	9	28	Now it happened that about eight days after these words , he took along Peter and John and James and [ r ] went up on the mountain to pray .
LEB	Luke	9	29	And as he was praying , the appearance of his face became different , and his clothing became white , gleaming like lightning . [ s ]
LEB	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men were talking with him , who were Moses and Elijah ,
LEB	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory and [ t ] were speaking about his departure which he was about to fulfill [ u ] in Jerusalem .
LEB	Luke	9	32	Now Peter and those with him were very sleepy , [ v ] but when they [ w ] became fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him .
LEB	Luke	9	33	And it happened that as they were going away from him , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here . And let us make three shelters , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah , ” not knowing what he was saying .
LEB	Luke	9	34	And while [ x ] he was saying these things , a cloud came and overshadowed them , and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud .
LEB	Luke	9	35	And a voice came from the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , my Chosen One . Listen to him ! ”
LEB	Luke	9	36	And after the voice had occurred , Jesus was found alone . And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen . A Demon-possessed Boy Healed
LEB	Luke	9	37	Now it happened that on the next day , when [ y ] they had come down from the mountain , a large crowd met him .
LEB	Luke	9	38	And behold , a man from the crowd cried out , saying , “ Teacher , I beg you to look with concern on my son , because he is my only son !
LEB	Luke	9	39	And behold , a spirit seizes him and suddenly he screams , and it convulses him with foam and rarely withdraws from him , battering him severely .
LEB	Luke	9	40	And I begged your disciples that they would expel it , and they were not able to do so. ”
LEB	Luke	9	41	So Jesus answered and [ z ] said , “ O unbelieving and perverted generation ! How long [ aa ] will I be with you and put up with you ? Bring your son here ! ”
LEB	Luke	9	42	And while [ ab ] he was still approaching , the demon threw him down and convulsed him . [ ac ] But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
LEB	Luke	9	43	And they were all astounded at the impressiveness of God . Jesus Predicts His Suffering But while they [ ad ] were all marveling at all the things that he was doing , he said to his disciples ,
LEB	Luke	9	44	“ You take these words to heart , [ ae ] for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men. ”
LEB	Luke	9	45	But they did not understand this statement , and it was concealed from them so that they could not understand it . And they were afraid to ask him about this statement . The Question About Who Is Greatest
LEB	Luke	9	46	And an argument developed among them as to who of them might be greatest .
LEB	Luke	9	47	But Jesus , because he [ af ] knew the thoughts of their hearts , took hold of a child and had him stand beside him
LEB	Luke	9	48	and said to them , “ Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me , and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me . For the one who is least among you all—this one is great. ” Whoever Is Not Against Us Is for Us
LEB	Luke	9	49	And John answered and [ ag ] said , “ Master , we saw someone expelling demons in your name , and we tried to prevent him , because he does not follow in company with us. ”
LEB	Luke	9	50	But Jesus said to him , “ Do not prevent him , [ ah ] because whoever is not against you is for you. ” Jesus Rejected in a Samaritan Village
LEB	Luke	9	51	Now it happened that when the days were approaching for him to be taken up , [ ai ] he set his [ aj ] face to go to Jerusalem .

LEB	Luke	10	4	Do not carry a money bag or a traveler ’ s bag or sandals , and greet no one along the road .
LEB	Luke	10	5	And into whatever house you enter , first say , “ Peace be to this household ! ”
LEB	Luke	10	6	And if a son of peace is there , your peace will rest on him . But if not , it will return to you .
LEB	Luke	10	7	And remain in the same house , eating and drinking whatever they provide , [ c ] for the worker is worthy of his pay . Do not move from house to house .

LEB	Luke	10	11	“ Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you ! Nevertheless know this : that the kingdom of God has come near ! ” [ f ]

LEB	Luke	10	13	Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes !
LEB	Luke	10	14	But it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon in the judgment than for you !
LEB	Luke	10	15	And you , Capernaum , will you be exalted to heaven ? No ! You will be brought down to Hades !

LEB	Luke	10	17	And the seventy-two returned with joy , saying , “ Lord , even the demons are subject to us in your name ! ”
LEB	Luke	10	18	So he said to them , “ I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven .

LEB	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , do not rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are inscribed in heaven. ” Jesus Rejoices and Prays
LEB	Luke	10	21	At that same time he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said , “ I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to young children . Yes , Father , for this was pleasing before you .

LEB	Luke	10	26	And he said to him , “ What is written in the law ? How do you read it ? ” [ j ]
LEB	Luke	10	27	And he answered and [ k ] said , “ You shall love the Lord your God from all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind , [ l ] and your neighbor as yourself. ” [ m ]
LEB	Luke	10	28	And he said to him , “ You have answered correctly . Do this and you will live. ”
LEB	Luke	10	29	But he , wanting to justify himself , said to Jesus , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
LEB	Luke	10	30	And [ n ] Jesus replied and [ o ] said , “ A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell into the hands of robbers , who both stripped him and beat him . [ p ] After [ q ] inflicting blows on him , [ r ] they went away , leaving him [ s ] half dead .
LEB	Luke	10	31	Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road , and when he [ t ] saw him , he passed by on the opposite side .
LEB	Luke	10	32	And in the same way also a Levite , when he [ u ] came down to the place [ v ] and saw him , [ w ] passed by on the opposite side .
LEB	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan who was traveling came up to him and , when he [ x ] saw him , [ y ] had compassion .
LEB	Luke	10	34	And he came up and [ z ] bandaged his wounds , pouring on olive oil and wine , and he put him on his own animal and [ aa ] brought him to an inn and took care of him .
LEB	Luke	10	35	And on the next day , he took out two denarii and [ ab ] gave them [ ac ] [ ad ] to the innkeeper , and said , “ Take care of him , and whatever you spend in addition , I will repay to you when I return .
LEB	Luke	10	36	Which of these three do you suppose became a neighbor of the man who fell among the robbers ? ”

LEB	Luke	11	11	But what father from among you , if his [ g ] son will ask for a fish , instead of a fish will give him a snake ?
LEB	Luke	11	2	And he said to them , “ When you pray , say , “ Father , may your name be treated as holy . May your kingdom come .
LEB	Luke	11	3	Give us each day our daily bread .
LEB	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . And do not lead us into temptation. ” Ask , Seek , Knock
LEB	Luke	11	5	And he said to them , “ Who of you will have a friend , and will go to him at midnight and say to him , ‘ Friend , lend me three loaves ,
LEB	Luke	11	6	because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey , and I do not have anything to set before him. ’
LEB	Luke	11	7	And that one will answer from inside and [ a ] say , ‘ Do not cause me trouble ! The door has already been shut and my children are with me in bed ! I am not able to get up to give you anything. ’ [ b ]
LEB	Luke	11	8	I tell you , even if he does not give him anything [ c ] after he [ d ] gets up because he is his friend , at any rate because of his impudence [ e ] he will get up and [ f ] give him whatever he needs .
LEB	Luke	11	9	And I tell you , ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and it will be opened for you .
LEB	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks receives , and the one who seeks finds , and to the one who knocks it will be opened .
LEB	Luke	11	12	Or also , if he will ask for an egg , will give him a scorpion ?
LEB	Luke	11	13	Therefore if you , although you [ h ] are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will the Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? ” A House Divided Can not Stand
LEB	Luke	11	14	And he was expelling a mute demon . [ i ] Now it happened that when [ j ] the demon came out , the man who had been mute spoke , and the crowds were astonished .
LEB	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ By Beelzebul the ruler of demons he expels demons ! ”
LEB	Luke	11	16	And others , in order to [ k ] test him , [ l ] were demanding from him a sign from heaven .
LEB	Luke	11	17	But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and a divided household [ m ] falls .
LEB	Luke	11	18	So if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? For you say that I expel demons by Beelzebul .
LEB	Luke	11	19	But if I expel demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your sons expel them ? [ n ] For this reason they will be your judges !
LEB	Luke	11	20	But if I expel demons by the finger of God , then the kingdom of God has come upon you !
LEB	Luke	11	21	When a strong man , fully armed , guards his own palace , his possessions are safe . [ o ]
LEB	Luke	11	22	But when a stronger man attacks him and [ p ] conquers him , he takes away his full armor in which he trusted and distributes his plunder .
LEB	Luke	11	23	The one who is not with me is against me , and the one who does not gather with me scatters . An Unclean Spirit Returns
LEB	Luke	11	24	“ Whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person , it travels through waterless places searching for rest , and does not find it . [ q ] It says , [ r ] ‘ I will return to my house from which I came out. ’
LEB	Luke	11	25	And when it [ s ] arrives it finds the house [ t ] swept and put in order .
LEB	Luke	11	26	Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they go in and [ u ] live there . And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first ! ”
LEB	Luke	11	27	Now it happened that as he said these things , a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and [ v ] said to him , “ Blessed is the womb that bore you , and the breasts at which you nursed ! ”
LEB	Luke	11	28	But he said , “ On the contrary , blessed are those who hear the word of God and follow it ! ” [ w ] The Sign of Jonah
LEB	Luke	11	29	And as [ x ] the crowds were increasing , he began to say , “ This generation is an evil generation ! It demands a sign , and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah !
LEB	Luke	11	30	For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so also the Son of Man will be to this generation .
LEB	Luke	11	31	The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and behold , something [ y ] greater than Solomon is here !
LEB	Luke	11	32	The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it , because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah , and behold , something [ z ] greater than Jonah is here ! Light and Darkness
LEB	Luke	11	33	“ No one after [ aa ] lighting a lamp puts it [ ab ] in a cellar or under a bushel basket , but on a lampstand , so that those who come in can see the light .
LEB	Luke	11	34	Your eye is the lamp of the body . When your eye is sincere , your whole body is full of light also . But when it is evil , your body is dark also .
LEB	Luke	11	35	Therefore pay careful attention that the light in you is not darkness !
LEB	Luke	11	36	If therefore your whole body is full of light , not having any part dark , it will be completely full of light , as when the lamp with its light gives light to you. ” Pharisees and Legal Experts Denounced
LEB	Luke	11	37	And as he was speaking , a Pharisee asked him to have a meal [ ac ] with him , and he went in and [ ad ] reclined at table .
LEB	Luke	11	38	And the Pharisee , when he [ ae ] saw it , [ af ] was astonished that he did not first wash before the meal .
LEB	Luke	11	39	But the Lord said to him , “ Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but your inside is full of greediness and wickedness .
LEB	Luke	11	40	Fools ! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also ?
LEB	Luke	11	41	But give as charitable giving the things that are within , and behold , everything is clean for you .
LEB	Luke	11	42	“ But woe to you , Pharisees , because you pay a tenth of mint and rue and every garden herb , and neglect justice and love for God ! But it was necessary to do these things without neglecting those things also .
LEB	Luke	11	43	Woe to you , Pharisees , because you love the best seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces !
LEB	Luke	11	44	Woe to you , because you are like unmarked graves , and the people who walk over them [ ag ] do not know it ! [ ah ]
LEB	Luke	11	45	And one of the legal experts answered and [ ai ] said to him , “ Teacher , when you [ aj ] say these things , you insult us also ! ”
LEB	Luke	11	46	So he said , “ Woe to you also , legal experts , because you load people with burdens hard to bear , and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers !
LEB	Luke	11	47	Woe to you , because you build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them !
LEB	Luke	11	48	As a result you are witnesses , and you approve of the deeds of your fathers , because they killed them and you build their tombs ! [ ak ]
LEB	Luke	11	49	For this reason also the wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send to them prophets and apostles , and some of them they will kill and persecute , ’
LEB	Luke	11	50	so that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation ,
LEB	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah , who perished between the altar and the temple building . [ al ] Yes , I tell you , it will be required of this generation !
LEB	Luke	11	52	Woe to you , legal experts , because you have taken away the key to knowledge ! You did not enter yourselves , and you hindered those who were entering ! ”
LEB	Luke	11	53	And when [ am ] he departed from there , the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly hostile , and to question him closely about many things ,

LEB	Luke	12	11	But when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities , do not be anxious how or what you should speak in your own defense or what you should say ,
LEB	Luke	12	13	Now someone from the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me ! ”
LEB	Luke	12	14	But he said to him , “ Man , who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you ? ”
LEB	Luke	12	15	And he said to them , “ Watch out and guard yourselves from all greediness , because not even when someone has an abundance does [ e ] his life consist of his possessions. ”
LEB	Luke	12	16	And he told a parable to them , saying , “ The land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest .
LEB	Luke	12	17	And he reasoned to himself , saying , ‘ What should I do ? For I do not have anywhere I can gather in my crops. ’
LEB	Luke	12	18	And he said , ‘ I will do this : I will tear down my barns and build larger ones , and I will gather in there all my grain and possessions .
LEB	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , “ Soul , you have many possessions stored up for many years . Relax , eat , drink , celebrate ! ” ’
LEB	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ Fool ! This night your life [ f ] is demanded from you , and the things which you have prepared—whose will they be ? ’
LEB	Luke	12	21	So is the one who stores up treasure for himself , and who is not rich toward God ! ” Anxiety
LEB	Luke	12	22	And he said to his disciples , “ For this reason I tell you , do not be anxious for your [ g ] life , what you will eat , or for your [ h ] body , what you will wear .
LEB	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body more than clothing .
LEB	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens , that they neither sow nor reap ; to them there is neither storeroom nor barn , and God feeds them . How much more are you worth than the birds ?
LEB	Luke	12	25	And which of you by [ i ] being anxious is able to add an hour [ j ] to his life span ?
LEB	Luke	12	26	If then you are not even able to do a very little thing , why are you anxious about the rest ?
LEB	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies , how they grow : they do not toil or spin , but I say to you , not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these .
LEB	Luke	12	28	But if God clothes the grass in the field in this way , although it [ k ] is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , how much more will he do so for [ l ] you , you of little faith ?
LEB	Luke	12	29	And you , do not consider what you will eat and what you will drink , and do not be anxious .
LEB	Luke	12	30	For all the nations of the world seek after these things , and your Father knows that you need these things .
LEB	Luke	12	31	But seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you .
LEB	Luke	12	32	“ Do not be afraid , little flock , because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom .
LEB	Luke	12	33	Sell your possessions and give charitable gifts . Make for yourselves money bags that do not wear out , an inexhaustible treasure in heaven [ m ] where thief does not approach or moth destroy .
LEB	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . On the Alert for the Master ’ s Return
LEB	Luke	12	35	“ You must be prepared for action [ n ] and your [ o ] lamps burning .
LEB	Luke	12	36	And you , be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast , [ p ] so that when he [ q ] comes back and knocks , they can open the door [ r ] for him immediately .
LEB	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he returns ! Truly I say to you that he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come by and [ s ] serve them .
LEB	Luke	12	38	Even if he should come back in the second or in the third watch of the night and find them [ t ] like this , blessed are they !
LEB	Luke	12	39	But understand this , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief was coming , he would not have left his house to be broken into .
LEB	Luke	12	40	You also must be ready , because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come. ” [ u ] A Faithful Slave and an Unfaithful Slave
LEB	Luke	12	41	And Peter said , “ Lord , are you telling this parable for us , or also for everyone ? ”
LEB	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , “ Who then is the faithful wise manager whom the master will put in charge over his servants to give them [ v ] their [ w ] food allowance at the right time ?
LEB	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he [ x ] comes back .
LEB	Luke	12	44	Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions .
LEB	Luke	12	45	But if that slave should say to himself , [ y ] ‘ My master is taking a long time to return , ’ and he begins to beat the male slaves and the female slaves and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
LEB	Luke	12	46	the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know , and will cut him in two and assign his place with the unbelievers .
LEB	Luke	12	47	And that slave who knew the will of his master and did not prepare or do according to his will will be given a severe beating . [ z ]
LEB	Luke	12	48	But the one who did not know and did things deserving blows will be given a light beating . [ aa ] And from everyone to whom much has been given , much will be demanded , and from him to whom they entrusted much , they will ask him for even more . Not Peace , But a Sword of Divisiveness
LEB	Luke	12	49	“ I have come to bring fire on the earth , and how I wish that it had been kindled already !
LEB	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how I am distressed until it is accomplished !
LEB	Luke	12	51	Do you think that I have come to grant peace on the earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division !
LEB	Luke	12	52	For from now on there will be five in one household , divided three against two and two against three .
LEB	Luke	12	53	They will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ” The Signs of the Times
LEB	Luke	12	54	And he also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud coming up in the west , you say at once , ‘ A rainstorm is coming , ’ and so it happens .
LEB	Luke	12	55	And when you see the south wind blowing , you say , ‘ There will be burning heat , ’ and it happens .
LEB	Luke	12	56	Hypocrites ! You know how to evaluate the appearance of the earth and the sky , but how is it you do not know how to evaluate this present time ? Settle Accounts Quickly
LEB	Luke	12	57	And why do you not also judge for yourselves what is right ?
LEB	Luke	12	58	For as you are going with your accuser before the magistrate , make an effort to come to a settlement with him on the way , so that he will not drag you to the judge , and the judge will hand you over to the bailiff , and the bailiff will throw you into prison .
LEB	Luke	12	59	I tell you , you will never get out of there until you have paid back even the last cent ! ” [ ab ] Footnotes - Luke 12:1 Literally “ which time ” - Luke 12:1 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ had gathered together ” ) - Luke 12:3 Literally “ you have spoken to the ear ” - Luke 12:5 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 12:15 Literally “ is ” - Luke 12:20 The same Greek word can be translated “ soul ” or “ life ” depending on the context - Luke 12:22 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 12:22 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 12:25 Here “ by ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ being anxious ” ) which is understood as means - Luke 12:25 Or “ a cubit ” ( the literal meaning ) ; most scholars understand this to refer figuratively to an “ hour ” of life here , though some take it as a literal measurement of height - Luke 12:28 Here “ although ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ is ” ) which is understood as concessive - Luke 12:28 The phrase “ will he do so for ” is not in the Greek text but is implied - Luke 12:33 Or “ in the heavens ” - Luke 12:35 Literally “ your loins must be girded ” - Luke 12:35 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 12:36 Or perhaps simply “ feast ” - Luke 12:36 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ comes back ” ) - Luke 12:36 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 12:37 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ will come by ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 12:38 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 12:40 * The words “ he will come ” are not in the Greek text but are implied - Luke 12:42 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 12:42 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 12:43 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ comes back ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 12:45 Literally “ in his heart ” - Luke 12:47 Literally “ will be beaten much ” - Luke 12:48 Literally “ will be beaten a few times ” - Luke 12:59 Literally “ lepton , ” a small copper coin worth 1/128 of a denarius

LEB	Luke	13	13	And he placed his [ n ] hands on her , and immediately she straightened up and glorified God .
LEB	Luke	13	2	And he answered and [ a ] said to them , “ Do you think that these Galileans were sinners worse than all the Galileans , because they suffered these things ?
LEB	Luke	13	3	No , I tell you , but unless you repent you will all perish as well !
LEB	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them—do you think that they were sinners worse than all the people who live in Jerusalem ?
LEB	Luke	13	5	No , I tell you , but unless you repent , you will all perish as well ! ” The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree
LEB	Luke	13	6	And he told this parable : “ A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any . [ b ]
LEB	Luke	13	7	So he said to the gardener , ‘ Behold , for three years [ c ] I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and did not find any . [ d ] Cut it down ! [ e ] Why should it even exhaust the soil ? ’
LEB	Luke	13	8	But he answered and [ f ] said to him , ‘ Sir , leave it alone this year also , until I dig around it and put manure on it . [ g ]
LEB	Luke	13	9	And if indeed it produces fruit in the coming year , so much the better , [ h ] but if not , you can cut it down. ’ ” A Woman with a Disabling Spirit Healed
LEB	Luke	13	10	Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath .
LEB	Luke	13	11	And behold , a woman was there [ i ] who had a spirit that had disabled her [ j ] for eighteen years , and she was bent over and not able to straighten herself up completely . [ k ]
LEB	Luke	13	12	And when he [ l ] saw her , Jesus summoned her [ m ] and said to her , “ Woman , you are freed from your disability ! ”
LEB	Luke	13	14	But the ruler of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , answered and [ o ] said to the crowd , “ There are six days on which it is necessary to work . Therefore come and [ p ] be healed on them , and not on the day of the Sabbath ! ”
LEB	Luke	13	15	But the Lord answered and said to him , “ Hypocrites ! Does not each one of you untie his ox or his [ q ] donkey from the feeding trough on the Sabbath and lead it [ r ] away to water it ? [ s ]
LEB	Luke	13	16	And this woman , who is a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan bound eighteen [ t ] long years—is it not necessary that she be released from this bond on the day of the Sabbath ? ”
LEB	Luke	13	17	And when [ u ] he said these things , all those who opposed him were humiliated , and the whole crowd was rejoicing at all the splendid things that were being done by him . The Parable of the Mustard Seed
LEB	Luke	13	18	Therefore he said , “ What is the kingdom of God like , and to what shall I compare it ?
LEB	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed that a man took and [ v ] sowed in his own garden , and it grew and became a tree , and the birds of the sky nested in its branches. ” The Parable of the Yeast
LEB	Luke	13	20	And again he said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
LEB	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman took and [ w ] hid in [ x ] three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened. ” The Narrow Door
LEB	Luke	13	22	And he was going throughout towns and villages , teaching and making his journey toward Jerusalem .
LEB	Luke	13	23	And someone said to him , “ Lord , are there only [ y ] a few who are saved ? ” And he said to them ,
LEB	Luke	13	24	“ Make every effort to enter through the narrow door , because many , I tell you , will seek to enter and will not be able to ,
LEB	Luke	13	25	when once the master of the house has gotten up and shut the door , and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door , saying , ‘ Lord , open the door [ z ] for us ! ’ And he will answer and [ aa ] say to you , ‘ I do not know where you are from ! ’
LEB	Luke	13	26	Then you will begin to say , ‘ We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets ! ’
LEB	Luke	13	27	And he will reply , saying to you , ‘ I do not know where you are from ! Go away from me , all you evildoers ! ’ [ ab ]
LEB	Luke	13	28	In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves thrown outside !
LEB	Luke	13	29	And they will come from east and west , and from north and south , and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God .
LEB	Luke	13	30	And behold , some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last. ” The Lament over Jerusalem
LEB	Luke	13	31	At that same hour some Pharisees came up and [ ac ] said to him , “ Go out and depart from here , because Herod wants to kill you ! ”
LEB	Luke	13	32	And he said to them , “ Go and [ ad ] tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I am expelling demons and performing healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I will complete my work. ’ [ ae ]
LEB	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless , it is necessary for me to be on the way today and tomorrow and on the next day , because it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem .
LEB	Luke	13	34	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her ! How many times I wanted to gather your children together the way [ af ] a hen gathers [ ag ] her own brood under her [ ah ] wings , and you were not willing !

LEB	Luke	14	2	And behold , a certain man was in front of him , suffering from edema .
LEB	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answered and [ b ] said to the legal experts and Pharisees , saying , “ Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath , or not ? ”
LEB	Luke	14	4	But they remained silent . And he took hold of him [ c ] and [ d ] healed him , and sent him [ e ] away .
LEB	Luke	14	5	And he said to them , “ Who among you , if your [ f ] son or your ox falls into a well [ g ] on the day of the Sabbath , will not immediately pull him out ? ”
LEB	Luke	14	6	And they were not able to make a reply to these things . The Parable of the Guests at the Wedding Feast
LEB	Luke	14	7	Now he told a parable to those who had been invited when he [ h ] noticed how they were choosing for themselves the places of honor , saying to them ,
LEB	Luke	14	8	“ When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast , [ i ] do not recline at the table in the place of honor , lest someone more distinguished than you has been invited by him ,
LEB	Luke	14	9	and the one who invited you both [ j ] will come and [ k ] say to you , ‘ Give the place to this person , ’ and then with shame you will begin to take the last place .
LEB	Luke	14	10	But when you are invited , go and [ l ] recline at the table in the last place , so that when the one who invited you comes , he will say to you , ‘ Friend , move up higher. ’ Then it will be an honor to you in the presence of all those who are reclining at the table with you .
LEB	Luke	14	11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ” The Parable of the Great Banquet
LEB	Luke	14	12	And he also said to the one who had invited him , “ When you give a dinner or a banquet , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or wealthy neighbors , lest they also invite you in return , and repayment come to you .
LEB	Luke	14	13	But whenever you give a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ,
LEB	Luke	14	15	Now when [ m ] one of those reclining at the table with him heard these things , he said to him , “ Blessed is everyone who [ n ] will eat bread in the kingdom of God ! ”
LEB	Luke	14	16	But he said to him , “ A certain man was giving a large banquet and invited many .
LEB	Luke	14	17	And he sent his slave at the hour of the banquet to say to those who have been invited , ‘ Come , because now it is ready ! ’
LEB	Luke	14	18	And they all alike [ o ] began to excuse themselves . The first said to him , ‘ I have purchased a field , and I must [ p ] go out to look at it . I ask you , consider me excused. ’
LEB	Luke	14	19	And another said , ‘ I have purchased five yoke of oxen , and I am going to examine them . I ask you , consider me excused. ’
LEB	Luke	14	20	And another said , ‘ I have married a wife , and for this reason I am not able to come. ’
LEB	Luke	14	21	And the slave came and [ q ] reported these things to his master . Then the master of the house became angry and [ r ] said to his slave , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame ! ’
LEB	Luke	14	22	And the slave said , ‘ Sir , what you ordered has been done , and there is still room. ’
LEB	Luke	14	23	And the master said to the slave , ‘ Go out into the highways and hedges and press them [ s ] to come in , so that my house will be filled !
LEB	Luke	14	24	For I say to you that none of those persons who were invited will taste my banquet ! ’ ” The Cost of Discipleship
LEB	Luke	14	25	Now large crowds were going along with him , and he turned around and [ t ] said to them ,
LEB	Luke	14	26	“ If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , and furthermore , even his own life , he can not be [ u ] my disciple .
LEB	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow [ v ] me can not be [ w ] my disciple .
LEB	Luke	14	28	For which of you , wanting to build a tower , does not first sit down and [ x ] calculate the cost to see if he has enough [ y ] to complete it ? [ z ]
LEB	Luke	14	29	Otherwise [ aa ] after [ ab ] he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it , [ ac ] all who see it [ ad ] will begin to ridicule him ,
LEB	Luke	14	30	saying , ‘ This man began to build and was not able to finish ! ’
LEB	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going out to engage another king in battle , does not sit down first and [ ae ] deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand .
LEB	Luke	14	32	But if not , while [ af ] the other is still far away , he sends an ambassador and [ ag ] asks for terms of [ ah ] peace .
LEB	Luke	14	33	In the same way , therefore , every one of you who does not renounce all his own possessions can not be [ ai ] my disciple .
LEB	Luke	14	34	“ Now salt is good , but if salt becomes tasteless , with what will it be made salty ?
LEB	Luke	14	35	It is usable neither for the soil nor for the manure pile ; they throw it out .

LEB	Luke	15	2	And both the Pharisees and the scribes were complaining , saying , “ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them ! ”
LEB	Luke	15	3	So he told them this parable , saying ,

LEB	Luke	15	11	And he said , “ A certain man had two sons .
LEB	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his [ k ] father , ‘ Father , give me the share of the property that is coming to me. ’ So he divided his [ l ] assets between them .
LEB	Luke	15	13	And after not many days , the younger son gathered everything and [ m ] went on a journey to a distant country , and there he squandered his wealth by [ n ] living wastefully .
LEB	Luke	15	14	And after [ o ] he had spent everything , there was a severe famine throughout that country , and he began to be in need .
LEB	Luke	15	16	And he was longing to fill his stomach with [ q ] the carob pods that the pigs were eating , and no one was giving anything [ r ] to him .
LEB	Luke	15	17	“ But when he [ s ] came to himself , he said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired workers have an abundance of food , [ t ] and I am dying here from hunger !
LEB	Luke	15	18	I will set out and [ u ] go to my father and will say to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ! [ v ]
LEB	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son ! Make me like one of your hired workers. ’
LEB	Luke	15	20	And he set out and [ w ] came to his own father . But while [ x ] he was still a long way away , his father saw him and had compassion , and ran and embraced him [ y ] and kissed him .
LEB	Luke	15	21	And his [ z ] son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and in your sight ! [ aa ] I am no longer worthy to be called your son ! ’
LEB	Luke	15	22	But his [ ab ] father said to his slaves , ‘ Quickly bring out the best robe and put it [ ac ] on him , and put a ring on his finger [ ad ] and sandals on his [ ae ] feet !
LEB	Luke	15	23	And bring the fattened calf—kill it [ af ] and let us eat and [ ag ] celebrate ,
LEB	Luke	15	24	because this son of mine was dead , and is alive again ! He was lost and is found ! ’ And they began to celebrate .
LEB	Luke	15	25	“ Now his older son was in the field , and when he came and [ ah ] approached the house , he heard music and dancing .
LEB	Luke	15	26	And he summoned one of the slaves and [ ai ] asked what these things meant .
LEB	Luke	15	27	And he said to him , ‘ Your brother has come , and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has gotten him back healthy. ’
LEB	Luke	15	28	But he became angry and did not want to go in . So his father came out and [ aj ] began to implore [ ak ] him .
LEB	Luke	15	29	But he answered and [ al ] said to his father , ‘ Behold , so many years I have served you , and have never disobeyed your command ! And you never gave me a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends !
LEB	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours returned—who has consumed your assets with prostitutes—you killed the fattened calf for him ! ’
LEB	Luke	15	31	But he said to him , ‘ Child , you are always with me , and everything I have belongs to you . [ am ]
LEB	Luke	15	32	But it was necessary to celebrate and to rejoice , because this brother of yours was dead , and is alive , and was lost , and is found ! ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 15:5 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ has found ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 15:5 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:5 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:6 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ returns ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 15:6 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:6 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:8 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:9 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ has found ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 15:9 * Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:9 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:12 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:12 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:13 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ gathered ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:13 Here “ by ” is supplied as a component of the adverbial participle of manner ( “ living ” ) - Luke 15:14 Here “ after ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ had spent ” ) - Luke 15:15 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ went ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:16 Some manuscripts have “ to stuff himself with ” - Luke 15:16 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:17 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ came ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 15:17 Literally “ of bread ” - Luke 15:18 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ set out ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:18 Literally “ in the sight of you ” - Luke 15:20 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ set out ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:20 Here “ while ” is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle ( “ away ” ) - Luke 15:20 Literally “ fell on his neck ” - Luke 15:21 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:21 Literally “ in the sight of you ” - Luke 15:22 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:22 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:22 Literally “ hand , ” but this is a metonymy of whole ( “ hand ” ) for part ( “ finger ” ) - Luke 15:22 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - Luke 15:23 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - Luke 15:23 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ eat ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:25 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ came ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:26 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ summoned ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:28 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ came out ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:28 The imperfect tense has been translated as ingressive here ( “ began to implore ” ) - Luke 15:29 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ answered ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 15:31 Literally “ all my things are yours ”

LEB	Luke	16	16	“ The law and the prophets were until John ; from that time on the kingdom of God has been proclaimed , and everyone is urgently pressed [ f ] into it .
LEB	Luke	16	2	And he summoned him and [ a ] said to him , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Give the account of your management , because you can no longer manage. ’
LEB	Luke	16	3	And the manager said to himself , ‘ What should I do , because my master is taking away the management from me ? I am not strong enough to dig ; I am ashamed to beg .
LEB	Luke	16	4	I know what I should do , so that when I am removed from the management they will welcome me into their homes ! ’
LEB	Luke	16	5	And he summoned each one of his own master ’ s debtors and [ b ] said to the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
LEB	Luke	16	6	And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of olive oil. ’ So he said to him , ‘ Take your promissory note and sit down quickly and [ c ] write fifty. ’
LEB	Luke	16	7	Then he said to another , ‘ And how much do you owe ? ’ And he said , ‘ A hundred measures of wheat. ’ He said to him , ‘ Take your promissory note and write eighty. ’
LEB	Luke	16	8	And the master praised the dishonest manager , because he had acted shrewdly . For the sons of this age are shrewder than the sons of light with regard to their own generation . [ d ]
LEB	Luke	16	9	And I tell you , make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth , so that when it runs out they will welcome you into the eternal dwellings .
LEB	Luke	16	10	“ The one who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much , and the one who is dishonest in very little is also dishonest in much .
LEB	Luke	16	11	If then you have not been faithful with unrighteous wealth , who will entrust to you the true riches ? [ e ]
LEB	Luke	16	12	And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to another , who will give you your own ?
LEB	Luke	16	13	No domestic slave is able to serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to one and will despise the other . You are not able to serve God and money. ” Hypocrisy , Law , and the Kingdom of God
LEB	Luke	16	14	Now the Pharisees , who were lovers of money , heard all these things , and they ridiculed him .
LEB	Luke	16	15	And he said to them , “ You are the ones who justify themselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts ! For what is considered exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God .
LEB	Luke	16	17	But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid . On Divorce
LEB	Luke	16	18	“ Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery . The Rich Man and Lazarus
LEB	Luke	16	19	“ Now a certain man was rich , and dressed in purple cloth and fine linen , feasting sumptuously every day .
LEB	Luke	16	20	And a certain poor man named [ g ] Lazarus , covered with sores , lay at his gate ,
LEB	Luke	16	21	and was longing to be filled with what fell from the table of the rich man . But even the dogs came and [ h ] licked his sores .
LEB	Luke	16	22	Now it happened that the poor man died , and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham ’ s side . [ i ] And the rich man also died and was buried .
LEB	Luke	16	23	And in Hades he lifted up his eyes as he [ j ] was in torment and [ k ] saw Abraham from a distance , and Lazarus at his side . [ l ]
LEB	Luke	16	24	And he called out and [ m ] said , ‘ Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus so that he could dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , because I am suffering pain in this flame ! ’
LEB	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , ‘ Child , remember that you received your good things during your life , and Lazarus likewise bad things . But now he is comforted here , but you are suffering pain .
LEB	Luke	16	26	And in addition to all these things , a great chasm has been established between us and you , so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able to do so , [ n ] nor can they cross over from there to us. ’
LEB	Luke	16	27	So he said , ‘ Then I ask you , father , that you send him to my father ’ s house ,
LEB	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers , so that he could warn them , in order that they also should not come to this place of torment ! ’
LEB	Luke	16	29	But Abraham said , ‘ They have Moses and the prophets ; they must listen to them. ’
LEB	Luke	16	30	And he said , ‘ No , father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent ! ’
LEB	Luke	16	31	But he said to him , ‘ If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 16:2 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ summoned ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 16:5 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ summoned ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 16:6 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ sit down ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 16:8 Or “ kind ” - Luke 16:11 * The word “ riches ” is not in the Greek text but is implied - Luke 16:16 The verb is translated here as a passive ; some English versions translate the verb as active ( “ forces their way into it ” ) - Luke 16:20 Literally “ by name ” - Luke 16:21 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ came ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 16:22 Literally “ the bosom of Abraham ” - Luke 16:23 Here “ as ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ was ” ) which is understood as temporal - Luke 16:23 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ lifted up ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 16:23 Literally “ in his bosom ” - Luke 16:24 Here “ and ” is supplied because the previous participle ( “ called out ” ) has been translated as a finite verb - Luke 16:26 * The words “ to do so ” are not in the Greek text but are implied

LEB	Luke	17	17	So Jesus answered and [ o ] said , “ Were not ten cleansed ? And where are the nine ?
LEB	Luke	17	2	It would be better for him if a millstone [ a ] is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea than that he causes one of these little ones to sin .
LEB	Luke	17	3	“ Be concerned about yourselves ! If your brother sins , rebuke him , and if he repents , forgive him .
LEB	Luke	17	4	And if he sins against you seven times in a day , and seven times he returns to you saying , ‘ I repent , ’ you must forgive him. ”
LEB	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith ! ”
LEB	Luke	17	6	So the Lord said , “ If you have faith like a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you .
LEB	Luke	17	7	“ And which of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding sheep [ b ] who comes in from the field will say to him , ‘ Come here at once and [ c ] recline at the table ’ ?
LEB	Luke	17	8	Will he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare something that I may eat , and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink , and after these things you will eat and drink. ’
LEB	Luke	17	9	He will not be grateful [ d ] to the slave because he did what was ordered , will he ? [ e ]
LEB	Luke	17	10	Thus you also , when you have done all the things you were ordered to do , [ f ] say , ‘ We are unworthy slaves ; we have done what we were obligated to do. ’ ” Ten Lepers Cleansed
LEB	Luke	17	11	And it happened that while traveling toward Jerusalem , he was passing through the region between [ g ] Samaria and Galilee .
LEB	Luke	17	12	And as [ h ] he was entering into a certain village , ten men met him [ i ] [ j ] —lepers , who stood at a distance .
LEB	Luke	17	13	And they raised their voices , saying , “ Jesus , Master , have mercy on us ! ”
LEB	Luke	17	14	And when he [ k ] saw them [ l ] he said to them , “ Go and [ m ] show yourselves to the priests. ” And it happened that as they were going , they were cleansed .
LEB	Luke	17	15	But one of them , when he [ n ] saw that he was healed , turned back , praising God with a loud voice .
LEB	Luke	17	16	And he fell on his face at his feet , giving thanks to him . And he was a Samaritan .
LEB	Luke	17	18	Was no one found to turn back and [ p ] give praise to God except this foreigner ? ”
LEB	Luke	17	19	And he said to him , “ Get up and [ q ] go your way . Your faith has saved you. ” The Coming of the Kingdom of God
LEB	Luke	17	20	Now when he [ r ] was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , he answered them and said , “ The kingdom of God does not come with things that can be observed , [ s ]
LEB	Luke	17	21	nor will they say , ‘ Behold , here it is ! ’ or ‘ There ! ’ For behold , the kingdom of God is in your midst. ” The Coming of the Son of Man
LEB	Luke	17	22	And he said to the disciples , “ Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it . [ t ]
LEB	Luke	17	23	And they will say to you , ‘ Behold , there ! ’ ‘ Behold , here ! ’ [ u ] Do not go out or run after them ! [ v ]
LEB	Luke	17	24	For just as the lightning shines forth , flashing from one place under heaven to another place under heaven , so the Son of Man will be in his day .
LEB	Luke	17	25	But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things , and to be rejected by this generation .
LEB	Luke	17	26	And just as it was in the days of Noah , so also it will be in the days of the Son of Man—
LEB	Luke	17	27	they were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were being given in marriage , until the day Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
LEB	Luke	17	28	Likewise , just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building .
LEB	Luke	17	29	But on the day that Lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all .
LEB	Luke	17	30	It will be just the same [ w ] on the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
LEB	Luke	17	31	On that day , whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house must not come down to take them away . And likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back
LEB	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife !
LEB	Luke	17	33	Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever loses it [ x ] will keep it .
LEB	Luke	17	34	I tell you that in that night there will be two in one bed ; one will be taken and the other will be left .
LEB	Luke	17	35	There will be two women [ y ] grinding at the same place ; one will be taken and the other will be left. ” [ z ]

LEB	Luke	18	18	And a certain ruler asked him , saying , “ Good Teacher , by [ k ] doing what will I inherit eternal life ? ”
LEB	Luke	18	2	saying , “ There was a certain judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not respect people .
LEB	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that town , and she kept coming to him , saying , ‘ Grant me justice against my adversary ! ’
LEB	Luke	18	4	And he was not willing for a time , but after these things he said to himself , ‘ Even if I do not fear God or respect people ,
LEB	Luke	18	5	yet because this widow is causing trouble for me , I will grant her justice , so that she does not wear me down in the end by her [ a ] coming back ! ’ ”
LEB	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , “ Listen to what the unrighteous judge is saying !
LEB	Luke	18	7	And will not God surely see to it that justice is done [ b ] to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night , and will he delay toward them ?
LEB	Luke	18	8	I tell you that he will see to it that justice is done [ c ] for them soon ! Nevertheless , when [ d ] the Son of Man comes , then will he find faith on earth ? ” The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector
LEB	Luke	18	9	And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and looked down on everyone else : [ e ]
LEB	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up to the temple to pray , one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector .
LEB	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and [ f ] prayed these things with reference to himself : ‘ God , I give thanks to you that I am not like other people—swindlers , unrighteous people , adulterers , or even like this tax collector !
LEB	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week ; I give a tenth of all that I get. ’
LEB	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector , standing far away , did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven , but was beating his breast , saying , ‘ God , be merciful to me , a sinner ! ’
LEB	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than that one ! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ” Little Children Brought to Jesus
LEB	Luke	18	15	Now they were bringing even their [ g ] babies to him so that he could touch them . But when [ h ] the disciples saw it , [ i ] they rebuked them .
LEB	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them to himself , saying , “ Allow the children to come to me , and do not forbid them , for to such belongs [ j ] the kingdom of God .
LEB	Luke	18	17	Truly I say to you , whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it. ” A Rich Young Man
LEB	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good except God alone .
LEB	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery , do not murder , do not steal , do not give false testimony , honor your father and mother. ’ ” [ l ]
LEB	Luke	18	21	And he said , “ All these I have observed from my [ m ] youth. ”
LEB	Luke	18	22	And when he [ n ] heard this , [ o ] Jesus said to him , “ You still lack one thing : [ p ] Sell all that you have , and distribute the proceeds [ q ] to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come , follow me. ”
LEB	Luke	18	23	But when he [ r ] heard these things he became very sad , because he was extremely wealthy .
LEB	Luke	18	24	And Jesus took notice of him [ s ] and [ t ] said , “ How difficult it is for [ u ] those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God !
LEB	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God .
LEB	Luke	18	26	So those who heard this [ v ] said , “ And who can be saved ? ”
LEB	Luke	18	27	But he said , “ What is impossible with men is possible with God. ”
LEB	Luke	18	28	And Peter said , “ Behold , we have left all that is ours [ w ] and [ x ] followed you. ”
LEB	Luke	18	29	And he said to them , “ Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God ,
LEB	Luke	18	30	who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come , eternal life. ” Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection a Third Time
LEB	Luke	18	31	And taking aside the twelve , he said to them , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written by the prophets with reference to the Son of Man will be accomplished .
LEB	Luke	18	32	For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on ,
LEB	Luke	18	33	and after [ y ] flogging him [ z ] they will kill him , and on the third day he will rise. ”
LEB	Luke	18	34	And they understood none of these things , and this saying was concealed from them , and they did not comprehend the things that were said . A Blind Man Healed at Jericho
LEB	Luke	18	35	Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging .
LEB	Luke	18	36	And when he [ aa ] heard a crowd going by , he inquired what this meant .
LEB	Luke	18	37	And they told him , “ Jesus the Nazarene is passing by. ”
LEB	Luke	18	38	And he called out , saying , “ Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
LEB	Luke	18	39	And those who were in front rebuked him , that he should be silent , but he cried out even more loudly , [ ab ] “ Son of David , have mercy on me ! ”
LEB	Luke	18	40	So Jesus stopped and [ ac ] ordered him to be brought to him . And when [ ad ] he approached , he asked him ,
LEB	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” And he said , “ Lord , that I may regain my sight .

LEB	Luke	19	19	So he said to this one also , ‘ And you be over five cities. ’
LEB	Luke	19	2	And there was [ b ] a man named [ c ] Zacchaeus , and he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
LEB	Luke	19	3	And he was seeking to see Jesus—who he was—and he was not able to as a result of the crowd , because he was short in stature .
LEB	Luke	19	4	And he ran on ahead and [ d ] climbed up into a sycamore tree so that he could see him , because he was going to go through that way .
LEB	Luke	19	5	And when he came to the place , Jesus looked up and [ e ] said to him , “ Zacchaeus , come down quickly , because it is necessary for me to stay at your house today ! ”
LEB	Luke	19	6	And he came down quickly and welcomed him joyfully .
LEB	Luke	19	7	And when they [ f ] saw it , [ g ] they all began to complain , [ h ] saying , “ He has gone in to find lodging with a man who is a sinner ! ”
LEB	Luke	19	8	And Zacchaeus stopped and [ i ] said to the Lord , “ Behold , half of my possessions , Lord , I am giving to the poor , and if I have extorted anything from anyone , I am paying it [ j ] back four times as much ! ”
LEB	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , because he too is a son of Abraham .
LEB	Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save those who are lost. ” The Parable of the Ten Minas
LEB	Luke	19	11	Now while [ k ] they were listening to these things , he went on and [ l ] told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately .
LEB	Luke	19	12	Therefore he said , “ A certain nobleman traveled to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return .
LEB	Luke	19	13	And summoning ten of his own slaves , he gave them ten minas [ m ] and said to them , ‘ Do business until I come back. ’ [ n ]
LEB	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him , and sent a delegation after him , saying , ‘ We do not want this man to be king over us ! ’
LEB	Luke	19	15	And it happened that when he returned after [ o ] receiving the kingdom , he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned to him , so that he could know what they had gained by trading .
LEB	Luke	19	16	So the first arrived , saying , ‘ Sir , your mina has made ten minas more ! ’
LEB	Luke	19	17	And he said to him , ‘ Well done , good slave ! Because you have been faithful in a very small thing , have authority [ p ] over ten cities. ’
LEB	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , ‘ Sir , your mina has made five minas. ’
LEB	Luke	19	20	And another came , saying , ‘ Sir , behold your mina , which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth .
LEB	Luke	19	21	For I was afraid of you , because you are a severe man—you withdraw what you did not deposit , and you reap what you did not sow ! ’
LEB	Luke	19	22	He said to him , ‘ By your own words [ q ] I will judge you , wicked slave ! You knew that I am a severe man , withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow .
LEB	Luke	19	23	And why did you not give my money to the bank , and I , when I [ r ] returned , would have collected it with interest ? ’
LEB	Luke	19	24	And to the bystanders he said , ‘ Take away from him the mina and give it [ s ] to the one who has the ten minas ! ’
LEB	Luke	19	25	And they said to him , ‘ Sir , he has ten minas. ’
LEB	Luke	19	26	‘ I tell you that to everyone who has , more will be given . But from the one who does not have , even what he has will be taken away .
LEB	Luke	19	27	But these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them [ t ] here and slaughter them in my presence ! ’ ” The Triumphal Entry
LEB	Luke	19	28	And after he [ u ] had said these things , he traveled on ahead , going up to Jerusalem .
LEB	Luke	19	29	And it happened that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany , to the hill [ v ] called the Mount of Olives , he sent two of the disciples ,
LEB	Luke	19	30	saying , ‘ Go into the village in front of you , in which as you [ w ] enter you will find a colt tied , on which no person has ever [ x ] sat , and untie it and [ y ] bring it . [ z ]
LEB	Luke	19	31	And if anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ [ aa ] you will say this : ‘ The Lord has need of it. ’ ”
LEB	Luke	19	32	So those who were sent went and [ ab ] found it [ ac ] just as he had told them .
LEB	Luke	19	33	And as [ ad ] they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , ‘ Why are you untying the colt ? ’
LEB	Luke	19	34	So they said , ‘ The Lord has need of it. ’
LEB	Luke	19	35	And they brought it to Jesus , and throwing their cloaks on the colt , they put Jesus on it .
LEB	Luke	19	36	And as [ ae ] he was going along , they were spreading out their cloaks on the road .
LEB	Luke	19	37	Now as [ af ] he was drawing near by this time to the descent from the Mount of Olives , the whole crowd of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen ,
LEB	Luke	19	38	saying , “ Blessed is the king , the one who comes in the name of the Lord ! [ ag ] Peace in heaven and glory in the highest ! ”
LEB	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples ! ”
LEB	Luke	19	40	And he answered and [ ah ] said , “ I tell you that [ ai ] if these keep silent , the stones will cry out ! ” Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem
LEB	Luke	19	41	And when he approached and [ aj ] saw the city , he wept over it ,
LEB	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If you had known on this day—even you—the things that make for peace ! But now they are hidden from your eyes .
LEB	Luke	19	43	For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment [ ak ] against you , and will surround you and press you hard from all directions .
LEB	Luke	19	44	And they will raze you to the ground , you and your children within you , and will not leave a stone upon a stone within you , because [ al ] you did not recognize the time of your visitation. ” The Cleansing of the Temple
LEB	Luke	19	45	And he entered into the temple courts [ am ] and [ an ] began to drive out those who were selling ,
LEB	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘ And my house will be a house of prayer , ’ [ ao ] but you have made it a cave of robbers ! ”
LEB	Luke	19	47	And he was teaching every day in the temple courts , [ ap ] and the chief priests and the scribes and the most prominent men of the people were seeking to destroy him .

LEB	Luke	20	20	And they watched him [ t ] closely and [ u ] sent spies who pretended they were upright , in order that they could catch him in a statement , so that they could hand him over to the authority and the jurisdiction of the governor .
LEB	Luke	20	2	and said , saying to him , “ Tell us , by what authority you are doing these things , or who is the one who gave you this authority ?
LEB	Luke	20	3	And he answered and [ c ] said to them , “ I also will ask you a question , and you tell me :
LEB	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men ?
LEB	Luke	20	5	And they discussed this [ d ] with one another , saying , “ If we say ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’
LEB	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ all the people will stone us to death , because they are convinced that John was a prophet. ”
LEB	Luke	20	7	And they replied that they did not know where it was from .
LEB	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them , “ Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. ” The Parable of the Tenant Farmers in the Vineyard
LEB	Luke	20	9	And he began to tell the people this parable : “ A man [ e ] planted a vineyard , and leased it to tenant farmers , and went on a journey for a long time .
LEB	Luke	20	10	And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenant farmers , so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard . But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after [ f ] beating him . [ g ]
LEB	Luke	20	11	And he proceeded to send another slave , but they beat and dishonored that one also , and [ h ] sent him [ i ] away empty-handed .
LEB	Luke	20	12	And he proceeded to send a third , but they wounded and [ j ] threw out this one also .
LEB	Luke	20	13	So the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What should I do ? I will send my beloved son ; perhaps they will respect him. ’
LEB	Luke	20	14	But when [ k ] the tenant farmers saw him , they began to reason [ l ] with one another , saying , ‘ This is the heir . Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours ! ’
LEB	Luke	20	15	And they threw him out of the vineyard and [ m ] killed him . [ n ] What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
LEB	Luke	20	16	He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others. ” And when they [ o ] heard this , [ p ] they said , “ May this never happen ! ”
LEB	Luke	20	17	But he looked intently at them and [ q ] said , “ What then is this that is written : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected , this has become the cornerstone. ’ [ r ]
LEB	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces , and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him ! ”
LEB	Luke	20	19	And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay their [ s ] hands on him at that same hour , and they were afraid of the people , for they knew that he had told this parable with reference to them . Paying Taxes to Caesar
LEB	Luke	20	21	And they asked him , saying , “ Teacher , we know that you speak and teach rightly , and do not show partiality , [ v ] but teach the way of God in truth .
LEB	Luke	20	22	Is it permitted for us to pay taxes [ w ] to Caesar or not ? ”
LEB	Luke	20	23	But seeing through their craftiness , he said to them ,
LEB	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a denarius ! Whose image and inscription does it have ? ” And they answered and [ x ] said , [ y ] “ Caesar ’ s. ”
LEB	Luke	20	25	So he said to them , “ Well then , give to Caesar the things of Caesar , and to God the things of God ! ”
LEB	Luke	20	26	And they were not able to catch him [ z ] [ aa ] in a statement in the sight of the people , and astonished at his answer , they became silent . A Question About Marriage and the Resurrection
LEB	Luke	20	27	Now some of the Sadducees—who deny that there is a resurrection [ ab ] —came up and [ ac ] asked him ,
LEB	Luke	20	28	saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us if someone ’ s brother dies having a wife , and this man is childless , that his brother should take the wife and father [ ad ] descendants for his brother .
LEB	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers , and the first took a wife and [ ae ] died childless ,
LEB	Luke	20	30	and the second ,
LEB	Luke	20	31	and the third took her , and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died .
LEB	Luke	20	32	Finally the woman also died .
LEB	Luke	20	33	Therefore in the resurrection , the woman—whose wife will she be ? For the seven had her as wife. ”
LEB	Luke	20	34	And Jesus said to them , “ The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage ,
LEB	Luke	20	35	but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage ,
LEB	Luke	20	36	for they are not even able to die any longer , because they are like the angels and are sons of God , because they [ af ] are sons of the resurrection .
LEB	Luke	20	37	But that the dead are raised , even Moses revealed in the passage about [ ag ] the bush , when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob .
LEB	Luke	20	38	Now he is not God of the dead , but of the living , for all live to him ! ”
LEB	Luke	20	39	And some of the scribes answered and [ ah ] said , “ Teacher , you have spoken well. ”
LEB	Luke	20	40	For they no longer dared to ask him anything . David ’ s Son and Lord
LEB	Luke	20	41	But he said to them , “ In what sense do they say that the Christ is David ’ s son ?
LEB	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the book of Psalms , ‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand ,
LEB	Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet. ” ’ [ ai ]
LEB	Luke	20	44	David therefore calls him ‘ Lord , ’ and how is he his son ? ” Warning to Beware of the Scribes
LEB	Luke	20	45	And while [ aj ] all the people were listening , he said to the disciples , [ ak ]
LEB	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes , who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets ,

LEB	Luke	24	24	And some of those with us went out to the tomb and found it [ q ] like this , just as the women had also said , but him they did not see. ”
LEB	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb ,
LEB	Luke	24	3	but when they [ a ] went in , they did not find the body . [ b ]
LEB	Luke	24	4	And it happened that while they were perplexed about this , behold , two men in gleaming clothing stood near them .
LEB	Luke	24	5	And as [ c ] they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground , they said to them , “ Why are you looking for the living among the dead ?
LEB	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but has been raised ! Remember how he spoke to you while he [ d ] was still in Galilee ,
LEB	Luke	24	7	saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of men who are sinners , and be crucified , and on the third day rise ? ”
LEB	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words ,
LEB	Luke	24	9	and when they [ e ] returned from the tomb , they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest .
LEB	Luke	24	10	Now Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the others with them were telling these things to the apostles .
LEB	Luke	24	11	And these words appeared to them as nonsense , and they refused to believe them .
LEB	Luke	24	12	But Peter got up and [ f ] ran to the tomb , and bending over to look , he saw only the strips of linen cloth , and he went away to his home [ g ] wondering what had happened . Jesus Encountered on the Road to Emmaus
LEB	Luke	24	13	And behold , on that same day , two of them were traveling to a village named [ h ] Emmaus that was sixty stadia [ i ] distant from Jerusalem ,
LEB	Luke	24	14	and they were conversing with one another about all these things that had happened .
LEB	Luke	24	15	And it happened that while they were conversing , and discussing , Jesus himself also approached and [ j ] began to go along with [ k ] them ,
LEB	Luke	24	16	but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him .
LEB	Luke	24	17	And he said to them , “ What are these matters that you are discussing with one another as you [ l ] are walking along ? ” And they stood still , looking sad .
LEB	Luke	24	18	And one of them , named [ m ] Cleopas , answered and [ n ] said to him , “ Are you the only one living near Jerusalem and not knowing the things that have happened in it in these days ? ”
LEB	Luke	24	19	And he said to them , “ What things ? ” So they said to him , “ The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene , a man who was a prophet , powerful in deed and word before God and all the people ,
LEB	Luke	24	20	and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to a sentence of death , and crucified him .
LEB	Luke	24	21	But we were hoping that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel . But in addition to all these things , this is the third day since [ o ] these things took place .
LEB	Luke	24	22	But also some women from among us astonished us , who were at the tomb early in the morning ,
LEB	Luke	24	23	and when they [ p ] did not find his body , they came back saying they had seen even a vision of angels , who said that he was alive !
LEB	Luke	24	25	And he said to them , “ O foolish and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken !
LEB	Luke	24	26	Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things and enter into his glory ? ”
LEB	Luke	24	27	And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures .
LEB	Luke	24	28	And they drew near to the village where they were going , and he acted as though he was going farther .
LEB	Luke	24	29	And they urged him strongly , saying , “ Stay with us , because it is getting toward evening , and by this time the day is far spent. ” And he went in to stay with them .
LEB	Luke	24	30	And it happened that when he reclined at the table with them , he took the bread and [ r ] gave thanks , and after [ s ] breaking it , [ t ] he gave it [ u ] to them .
LEB	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened , and they recognized him , and he became invisible to them .
LEB	Luke	24	32	And they said to one another , “ Were not our hearts burning within us while he was speaking with us on the road , while he was explaining the scriptures to us ? ”
LEB	Luke	24	33	And they got up that same hour and [ v ] returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those with them assembled ,
LEB	Luke	24	34	saying , “ The Lord has really been raised , and has appeared to Simon ! ”
LEB	Luke	24	35	And they began describing [ w ] what happened [ x ] on the road , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread . Jesus Appears to His Disciples
LEB	Luke	24	36	And while [ y ] they were saying these things , he himself stood there among them . [ z ]
LEB	Luke	24	37	But they were startled and became terrified , and [ aa ] thought they had seen a ghost .
LEB	Luke	24	38	And he said to them , “ Why are you frightened ? And for what reason do doubts arise in your hearts ?
LEB	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet , that I am I myself ! Touch me and see , because a ghost does not have flesh and bones , as you see that I have. ” [ ab ]
LEB	Luke	24	40	And when he [ ac ] had said this , he showed them his [ ad ] hands and his [ ae ] feet .
LEB	Luke	24	41	And while [ af ] they were still disbelieving because of joy and were marveling , he said to them , “ Do you have anything to eat [ ag ] here ? ”
LEB	Luke	24	42	So they gave him a piece of broiled fish ,
LEB	Luke	24	43	and he took it [ ah ] and [ ai ] ate it [ aj ] in front of them . Jesus Commissions His Disciples
LEB	Luke	24	44	And he said to them , “ These are my words that I spoke to you while I [ ak ] was still with you , that everything that is written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled. ”
LEB	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures ,
LEB	Luke	24	46	and said to them , “ Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day ,
LEB	Luke	24	47	and repentance and the forgiveness [ al ] of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations , [ am ] beginning from Jerusalem .
LEB	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses of these things .
LEB	Luke	24	49	And behold , I am sending out [ an ] what was promised by my Father upon you , but you stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high. ” The Ascension
LEB	Luke	24	50	And he led them out as far as Bethany , and lifting up his hands , he blessed them .
LEB	Luke	24	51	And it happened that while he was blessing them , he parted from them and was taken up into heaven .
LEB	Luke	24	52	And they worshiped him and [ ao ] returned to Jerusalem with great joy .

LEB	John	1	5	And the light shines in the darkness , and the darkness did not overcome [ c ] it .
LEB	John	1	6	A man came , sent from God , whose name was [ d ] John .
LEB	John	1	7	This one came for a witness , in order that he could testify about the light , so that all would believe through him .
LEB	John	1	8	That one was not the light , but came [ e ] in order that he could testify about the light .
LEB	John	1	9	The true light , who gives light to every person , was coming into the world .
LEB	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world came into being through him , and the world did not recognize [ f ] him .
LEB	John	1	11	He came to his own things , and his own people did not receive him .
LEB	John	1	12	But as many as received him—to those who believe in his name—he gave to them authority to become children of God ,
LEB	John	1	13	who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of a husband , but of God .
LEB	John	1	14	And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us , and we saw his glory , glory as of the one and only from the Father , full of grace and truth .
LEB	John	1	15	John testified about him and cried out , saying , “ This one was he about whom I said , ‘ The one who comes after me is ahead of me , because he existed before me. ’ ”

LEB	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , “ I baptize with water . In your midst stands one whom you do not know—
LEB	John	1	27	the one who comes after me , of whom I am not worthy to untie [ k ] the strap of his sandal ! ”
LEB	John	1	28	These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan , where John was baptizing .

LEB	John	1	33	And I did not know him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water , that one said to me , ‘ The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. ’

LEB	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and said to him , “ We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law , and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth ! ”
LEB	John	1	46	And Nathanael said to him , “ Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see ! ”
LEB	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him , “ Look ! A true Israelite [ q ] in whom is no deceit ! ”
LEB	John	1	48	Nathanael said to him , “ From where do you know me ? ” Jesus answered and said to him , “ Before Philip called you , when you [ r ] were under the fig tree , I saw you. ”
LEB	John	1	49	Nathanael answered him , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! You are the king of Israel ! ”
LEB	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree , do you believe ? You will see greater things than these ! ”

LEB	John	3	3	) - John 3:14 An allusion to Num 21:5–9 - John 3:15 Some interpreters and Bible translations extend the quotation of Jesus ’ words through v.
LEB	John	3	2	This man came to him at night and said to him , “ Rabbi , we know that you are [ b ] a teacher who has come from God , for no one is able to perform these signs that you are performing unless God were with him. ”
LEB	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to him , “ How can a man be born when he is an old man ? He is not able to enter into his mother ’ s womb for the second time and be born , can he ? ” [ d ]
LEB	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Truly , truly I say to you , unless someone is born of water and spirit , he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God .
LEB	John	3	6	What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
LEB	John	3	7	Do not be astonished that I said to you , ‘ It is necessary for you to be born from above. ’ [ e ]
LEB	John	3	8	The wind blows wherever it wishes , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going . So is everyone who is born of the Spirit. ”
LEB	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said to him , “ How can these things be ? ”
LEB	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Are you the teacher of Israel , and you do not understand these things ?
LEB	John	3	11	Truly , truly I say to you , we speak what we know , and we testify about what we have seen , and you do not accept our testimony !
LEB	John	3	12	If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things ?
LEB	John	3	13	And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man .
LEB	John	3	14	And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness , [ f ] thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up ,
LEB	John	3	15	so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life. ” [ g ] God ’ s Love for the World
LEB	John	3	16	For in this way God loved the world , so that he gave his one and only Son , in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish , but will have eternal life .
LEB	John	3	17	For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge [ h ] the world , but in order that the world should be saved through him .
LEB	John	3	18	The one who believes in him is not judged , [ i ] but the one who does not believe has already been judged , [ j ] because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God .
LEB	John	3	19	And this is the judgment : that the light has come into the world , and people loved the darkness rather than the light , because their deeds were evil .
LEB	John	3	20	For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light , lest his deeds be exposed .
LEB	John	3	21	- John 3:17 Or “ he should condemn ” - John 3:18 Or “ condemned ” - John 3:18 Or “ been condemned ” - John 3:25 Some significant early manuscripts read “ the Jews ” - John 3:29 Literally “ with joy ” - John 3:36 Some interpreters and Bible translations extend the quotation of John the Baptist ’ s words through v.
LEB	John	3	22	After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory , and there he spent time with them and was baptizing .
LEB	John	3	23	Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim , because water was plentiful there , and they were coming and were being baptized .
LEB	John	3	24	( For John had not yet been thrown into prison . )
LEB	John	3	25	So a dispute occurred on the part of John ’ s disciples with a Jew [ k ] concerning purification .
LEB	John	3	26	And they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan , about whom you testified—look , this one is baptizing , and all are coming to him ! ”
LEB	John	3	27	John answered and said , “ A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven !
LEB	John	3	28	You yourselves testify about me that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ , but I am sent before that one. ’
LEB	John	3	29	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom . But the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices greatly [ l ] because of the bridegroom ’ s voice . So this joy of mine is complete .
LEB	John	3	30	It is necessary for that one to increase , but for me to decrease. ”
LEB	John	3	31	The one who comes from above is over all . The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth ; the one who comes from heaven is over all .
LEB	John	3	32	What he has seen and heard , this he testifies , and no one accepts his testimony .
LEB	John	3	33	The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true .
LEB	John	3	34	For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God , for he does not give the Spirit by measure .
LEB	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand .

LEB	John	4	4	And it was necessary for him to go through Samaria .
LEB	John	4	2	( although Jesus himself was not baptizing , but his disciples ) ,
LEB	John	4	3	he left Judea and departed again for Galilee .
LEB	John	4	5	Now he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar , near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph .
LEB	John	4	6	And Jacob ’ s well was there , so Jesus , because he had become tired from the journey , simply sat down at the well . It was about the sixth hour .
LEB	John	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give me water [ a ] to drink. ”
LEB	John	4	8	( For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food . )
LEB	John	4	9	So the Samaritan woman said to him , “ How do you , being a Jew , ask from me water [ b ] to drink , since I [ c ] am a Samaritan woman ? ” ( For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . )
LEB	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said to her , “ If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you , ‘ Give me water [ d ] to drink , ’ you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water. ”
LEB	John	4	11	The woman said to him , “ Sir , you have no bucket and the well is deep ! From where then do you get this living water ?
LEB	John	4	12	You are not greater than our father Jacob , are you , [ e ] who gave us the well and drank from it himself , and his sons and his livestock ? ”
LEB	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , “ Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again .
LEB	John	4	14	But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity , but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life. ”
LEB	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water , so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water ! ” [ f ]
LEB	John	4	16	He said to her , “ Go , call your husband and come here. ”
LEB	John	4	17	The woman answered and said to him , “ I do not have a husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You have said rightly , ‘ I do not have a husband , ’
LEB	John	4	18	for you have had five husbands , and the one whom you have now is not your husband ; this you have said truthfully ! ”
LEB	John	4	19	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I see that you are a prophet .
LEB	John	4	20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain , and you people [ g ] say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship. ”
LEB	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , “ Believe me , woman , that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father .
LEB	John	4	22	You worship what you do not know . We worship what we know , because salvation is from the Jews .
LEB	John	4	23	But an hour is coming—and now is here [ h ] —when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for indeed the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers .
LEB	John	4	24	God is spirit , and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth. ”
LEB	John	4	25	The woman said to him , “ I know that Messiah is coming ” ( the one called Christ ) ; “ whenever that one comes , he will proclaim all things to us. ”
LEB	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , “ I , the one speaking to you , am he . [ i ] The Disciples and the Harvest
LEB	John	4	27	And at this point [ j ] his disciples came , and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman . However , no one said , “ What do you seek ? ” or “ Why are you speaking with her ? ”
LEB	John	4	28	So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people , [ k ]
LEB	John	4	29	“ Come , see a man who told me everything I have ever done ! Perhaps this one is the Christ ? ”
LEB	John	4	30	They went out from the town and were coming to him .
LEB	John	4	31	In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him , saying , “ Rabbi , eat something ! ” [ l ]
LEB	John	4	32	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat that you do not know about. ”
LEB	John	4	33	So the disciples began to say [ m ] to one another , “ No one brought him anything [ n ] to eat , did they ? ” [ o ]
LEB	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , “ My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work .
LEB	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ There are yet four months and the harvest comes ’ ? Behold , I say to you , lift up your eyes and look at the fields , that they are white for harvest already . [ p ]
LEB	John	4	36	The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life , in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together .
LEB	John	4	37	For in this instance [ q ] the saying is true , ‘ It is one who sows and another who reaps. ’
LEB	John	4	38	I sent you to reap what you did not work for ; others have worked , and you have entered into their work. ” The Samaritans and the Savior of the World
LEB	John	4	39	Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified , “ He told me everything that I have done. ”
LEB	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to him , they began asking [ r ] him to stay with them . And he stayed there two days .
LEB	John	4	41	And many more believed because of his word ,
LEB	John	4	42	And they were saying to the woman , “ No longer because of what you said [ s ] do we believe , for we ourselves have heard , and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world ! ” Return to Galilee
LEB	John	4	43	And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee .
LEB	John	4	44	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland .
LEB	John	4	45	So when he came to Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , because they [ t ] had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast ( for they themselves had also come to the feast ) . A Royal Official ’ s Son Is Healed
LEB	John	4	46	Now he came again to Cana in Galilee , where he had made the water wine . And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick .
LEB	John	4	47	This man , when he [ u ] heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee , went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son , for he was about to die .
LEB	John	4	48	So Jesus said to him , “ Unless you people [ v ] see signs and wonders , you will never believe ! ”
LEB	John	4	49	The royal official said to him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies ! ”
LEB	John	4	50	Jesus said to him , “ Go , your son will live. ” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he departed .
LEB	John	4	51	Now as [ w ] he was going down , his slaves met him , saying that his child was alive .
LEB	John	4	52	So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better . Then they said to him , “ Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. ”
LEB	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was that [ x ] same hour at which Jesus said to him , “ Your son will live , ” and he himself believed , and his whole household .
LEB	John	4	54	Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he [ y ] came from Judea into Galilee .

LEB	John	5	5	And a certain man was there who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness .
LEB	John	5	2	Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic Bethzatha , [ a ] which has five porticoes .
LEB	John	5	3	In these were lying a large number of those who were sick , blind , lame , paralyzed . [ b ]
LEB	John	5	6	Jesus , when he [ c ] saw this one lying there and knew that he had been sick [ d ] a long time already , said to him , “ Do you want to become well ? ”
LEB	John	5	7	The one who was sick answered him , “ Sir , I do not have anyone that , whenever the water is stirred up , could put me into the pool . But while [ e ] I am coming , another goes down before me. ”
LEB	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , “ Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk ! ”
LEB	John	5	9	And immediately the man became well and picked up his mat and began to walk . [ f ] ( Now it was the Sabbath on that day . )
LEB	John	5	10	So the Jews were saying to the one who had been healed , “ It is the Sabbath , and it is not permitted for you to pick up the mat ! ” [ g ]
LEB	John	5	11	But he answered them , “ The one who made me well—that one said to me , ‘ Pick up your mat and walk ! ’ ”
LEB	John	5	12	So they asked him , [ h ] “ Who is the man who said to you , ‘ Pick up your mat [ i ] and walk ? ’ ”
LEB	John	5	13	But the one who was healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had withdrawn while [ j ] a crowd was in the place . Equal with God
LEB	John	5	14	After these things Jesus found him at the temple and said to him , “ Look , you have become well ! Sin no longer , lest something worse happen to you. ”
LEB	John	5	15	The man went and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the one who made him well .
LEB	John	5	16	And on account of this the Jews began to persecute [ k ] Jesus , because he was doing these things on the Sabbath .
LEB	John	5	17	But he answered [ l ] them , “ My Father is working until now , and I am working. ”
LEB	John	5	18	So on account of this the Jews were seeking even more to kill him , because he not only was breaking the Sabbath , but also was calling God his own Father , thus [ m ] making himself equal with God . The Authority of the Son
LEB	John	5	19	So Jesus answered and said to them , “ Truly , truly I say to you , the Son can do nothing from himself except what he sees the Father doing . For whatever that one does , these things also the Son does likewise .
LEB	John	5	20	For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing . And greater works than these he will show him , so that you will be astonished .
LEB	John	5	21	For just as the Father raises the dead and makes them [ n ] alive , thus also the Son makes alive whomever he wishes .
LEB	John	5	22	For the Father does not judge anyone , but he has given all judgment to the Son ,
LEB	John	5	23	in order that all people [ o ] will honor the Son , just as they honor the Father . The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
LEB	John	5	24	Truly , truly I say to you that the one who hears my word and who believes the one who sent me has eternal life , and does not come into judgment , but has passed from death into life .
LEB	John	5	25	“ Truly , truly I say to you , that an hour is coming—and now is here—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and the ones who hear will live .
LEB	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in himself , thus also he has granted to the Son to have life in himself .
LEB	John	5	27	And he has granted him authority to carry out judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
LEB	John	5	28	“ Do not be astonished at this , because an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice
LEB	John	5	29	and they will come out—those who have done good things to a resurrection of life , but those who have practiced evil things to a resurrection of judgment .
LEB	John	5	30	I am able to do nothing from myself . Just as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is just , because I do not seek my own will , but the will of the one who sent me . Further Testimony About the Son
LEB	John	5	31	“ If I testify about myself , my testimony is not true .
LEB	John	5	32	There is another who testifies about me , and I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true .
LEB	John	5	33	You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth .
LEB	John	5	34	( And I do not receive testimony from people , but I say these things in order that you may be saved . )
LEB	John	5	35	That one was the lamp which was burning and shining , and you wanted to rejoice for an hour in his light .
LEB	John	5	36	“ But I have a testimony greater than John ’ s , for the works which the Father has given to me that I should complete them—the very works which I am doing—these testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
LEB	John	5	37	And the Father who sent me , that one has testified about me . You have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form .
LEB	John	5	38	And you do not have his word residing in yourselves , because the one whom that one sent , in this one you do not believe .
LEB	John	5	39	You search [ p ] the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them , and it is these that testify about me .
LEB	John	5	40	And you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life .
LEB	John	5	41	“ I do not accept glory [ q ] from people ,
LEB	John	5	42	but I know you , that you do not have the love of God in yourselves .
LEB	John	5	43	I have come in my Father ’ s name , and you do not accept me . If another should come in his own name , you would accept that one !
LEB	John	5	44	How are you able to believe , if you [ r ] accept glory from one another , and do not seek the glory which is from the only God ?
LEB	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father ! The one who accuses you is Moses , in whom you have put your hope !
LEB	John	5	46	For if you had believed Moses , you would believe me , for that one wrote about me .
LEB	John	5	47	But if you do not believe that one ’ s writings , how will you believe my words ? ” Footnotes - John 5:2 The majority of later manuscripts read “ Bethesda , ” while other early manuscripts read “ Bethsaida ” - John 5:3 The majority of later manuscripts add the following words : “ waiting for the moving of the water .

LEB	John	6	15	Then Jesus , because he [ h ] knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make him [ i ] king , withdrew again up the mountain by himself alone . Jesus Walks on the Water
LEB	John	6	16	Now when evening came , his disciples went down to the sea .
LEB	John	6	17	And getting into a boat , they began to go [ j ] to the other side of the sea , to Capernaum . And it had already become dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
LEB	John	6	18	And the sea began to be stirred up [ k ] because [ l ] a strong wind was blowing .
LEB	John	6	19	Then when they [ m ] had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia , [ n ] they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat , and they were afraid .
LEB	John	6	20	But he said to them , “ It is I ! Do not be afraid ! ”
LEB	John	6	21	So they were wanting to take him into the boat , and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going . Discourse About the Bread of Life
LEB	John	6	22	On the next day , the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there ( except one ) , and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat , but his disciples had departed alone .
LEB	John	6	23	Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after [ o ] the Lord had given thanks .
LEB	John	6	24	So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus .
LEB	John	6	25	And when they [ p ] found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
LEB	John	6	26	Jesus replied to them and said , “ Truly , truly I say to you , you seek me not because you saw signs , but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied !
LEB	John	6	27	Do not work for the food that perishes , but the food that remains to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . For God the Father has set his seal on this one. ”
LEB	John	6	28	So they said to him , “ What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God ? ”
LEB	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , “ This is the work of God : that you believe in the one whom that one sent. ”
LEB	John	6	30	So they said to him , “ Then what sign will you perform , so that we can see it [ q ] and believe you ? What will you do ?
LEB	John	6	31	Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , just as it is written , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ [ r ]
LEB	John	6	32	Then Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly I say to you , Moses did not give you bread from heaven , but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven !
LEB	John	6	33	For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
LEB	John	6	34	So they said to him , “ Sir , always give us this bread ! ”
LEB	John	6	35	Jesus said to them , “ I am the bread of life . The one who comes to me will never be hungry , and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again .
LEB	John	6	36	But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe .
LEB	John	6	37	Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me , and the one who comes to me I will never throw out ,
LEB	John	6	38	because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will , but the will of the one who sent me .
LEB	John	6	39	Now this is the will of the one who sent me : that everyone whom he has given me , I would not lose any of them , [ s ] but raise them [ t ] up on the last day .
LEB	John	6	40	For this is the will of my Father , that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day. ”
LEB	John	6	41	Now the Jews began to grumble [ u ] about him because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven , ”
LEB	John	6	42	and they were saying , “ Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? How does he now say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
LEB	John	6	43	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Do not grumble among yourselves ! [ v ]
LEB	John	6	44	No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him , and I will raise him up on the last day .
LEB	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , ‘ And they will all be taught by God. ’ [ w ] Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me .
LEB	John	6	46	( Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God—this one has seen the Father . ) [ x ]
LEB	John	6	47	Truly , truly I say to you , the one who believes has eternal life .
LEB	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
LEB	John	6	49	Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died .
LEB	John	6	50	This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die .
LEB	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . If anyone eats from this bread , he will live forever . [ y ] And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh. ”
LEB	John	6	52	So the Jews began to quarrel [ z ] among themselves , [ aa ] saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
LEB	John	6	53	Then Jesus said to them , “ Truly , truly I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you do not have life in yourselves !
LEB	John	6	54	The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
LEB	John	6	55	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
LEB	John	6	56	The one who eats [ ab ] my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him .
LEB	John	6	57	Just as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , so also the one who eats [ ac ] me—that one will live because of me .
LEB	John	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven , not as the fathers ate and died . The one who eats [ ad ] this bread will live forever. ” [ ae ] Many of Jesus ’ Disciples Offended by His Teaching
LEB	John	6	59	He said these things while [ af ] teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum .
LEB	John	6	60	Thus many of his disciples , when they [ ag ] heard it , [ ah ] said , “ This saying is hard ! Who can understand it ? ”
LEB	John	6	61	But Jesus , because he [ ai ] knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this , said to them , “ Does this cause you to be offended ?
LEB	John	6	62	Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before ?
LEB	John	6	63	The Spirit is the one who gives life ; the flesh profits nothing . The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life .
LEB	John	6	64	But there are some of you who do not believe. ” ( For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who it was who would betray him . )
LEB	John	6	65	And he said , “ Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father. ” Peter ’ s Confession
LEB	John	6	66	For this reason many of his disciples drew back [ aj ] and were not walking with him any longer .
LEB	John	6	67	So Jesus said to the twelve , “ You do not want to go away also , do you ? ” [ ak ]
LEB	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , to whom would we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
LEB	John	6	69	And we have believed , and have come to know , that you are the Holy One of God. ”
LEB	John	6	70	Jesus replied to them , “ Did I not choose you , the twelve , and one of you is the devil ? ”

LEB	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but it hates me , because I am testifying about it , that its deeds are evil .
LEB	John	7	2	Now the feast of the Jews—the feast of Tabernacles—was near .
LEB	John	7	3	So his brothers said to him , “ Depart from here and go to Judea , so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing .
LEB	John	7	4	For no one does anything in secret and yet he himself desires to be publicly recognized . [ a ] If you are doing these things , reveal yourself to the world ! ”
LEB	John	7	5	( For not even his brothers believed in him . ) Jesus at the Feast of Tabernacles
LEB	John	7	6	So Jesus said to them , “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always ready .
LEB	John	7	8	You go up to the feast . I am not [ b ] going up to this feast , because my time is not yet completed . [ c ]
LEB	John	7	9	And when he [ d ] had said these things , he remained in Galilee .
LEB	John	7	10	But when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not openly , but ( as it were ) in secret .
LEB	John	7	11	So the Jews were looking for him at the feast , and were saying , “ Where is he ? ”
LEB	John	7	12	And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds ; some were saying , “ He is a good man , ” but others were saying , “ No , but he deceives the crowd. ”
LEB	John	7	13	However , no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews .
LEB	John	7	14	Now when the feast was already half over , [ e ] Jesus went to the temple courts [ f ] and began to teach . [ g ]
LEB	John	7	15	Then the Jews were astonished , saying , “ How does this man possess knowledge , [ h ] because he [ i ] has not been taught ? ”
LEB	John	7	16	So Jesus answered them and said , “ My teaching is not mine , but is from the one who sent me .
LEB	John	7	17	If anyone wants to do his will , he will know about my [ j ] teaching , whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself .
LEB	John	7	18	The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory . But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him—this one is true , and there is no unrighteousness in him .
LEB	John	7	19	Has not Moses given you the law , and none of you carries out the law ? Why do you seek to kill me ? ”
LEB	John	7	20	The crowd replied , “ You have a demon ! Who is seeking to kill you ? ”
LEB	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said to them , “ I performed one work , and you are all astonished .
LEB	John	7	22	Because of this Moses has given you circumcision ( not that it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) , and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
LEB	John	7	23	If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken , are you angry with me because I made a whole man well [ k ] on the Sabbath ?
LEB	John	7	24	Do not judge according to outward appearance , but judge according to righteous judgment ! ” Is Jesus the Christ ?
LEB	John	7	25	Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say , [ l ] “ Is this not the one whom they are seeking to kill ?
LEB	John	7	26	And behold , he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him ! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ ?
LEB	John	7	27	Yet we know where this man is from , but the Christ , whenever he comes—no one knows where he is from ! ”
LEB	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts , [ m ] teaching and saying , “ You both know me and you know where I am from ! And I have not come from myself , but the one who sent me is true , whom you do not know .
LEB	John	7	29	I know him , because I am from him and he sent me. ”
LEB	John	7	30	So they were seeking to seize him , and no one laid a hand on him , because his hour had not yet come .
LEB	John	7	31	But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying , “ Whenever the Christ comes , he will not perform more signs than this man has done , will he ? ” [ n ]
LEB	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him , and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order to take him into custody . [ o ]
LEB	John	7	33	Then Jesus said , “ Yet a little time I am with you , and I am going to the one who sent me .
LEB	John	7	34	You will seek me and will not find me , [ p ] [ q ] and where I am , you can not come. ”
LEB	John	7	35	So the Jews said to one another , “ Where is this one going to go , that we will not find him ? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks , is he ? [ r ]
LEB	John	7	36	What is this saying that he said , ‘ You will seek me and will not find me , [ s ] [ t ] and where I am , you can not come ’ ? ” The Promise of the Spirit
LEB	John	7	37	Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out , saying , “ If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me , and let him drink ,

LEB	John	7	39	Now he said this concerning the Spirit , whom those who believed in him were about to receive . For the Spirit was not yet given , [ w ] because Jesus had not yet been glorified . ) Different Opinions About Jesus
LEB	John	7	40	Then , when they [ x ] heard these words , some from the crowd began to say , [ y ] “ This man is truly the Prophet ! ”
LEB	John	7	41	Others were saying , “ This man is the Christ ! ” But others were saying , “ No , for the Christ does not come from Galilee , does he ? [ z ]
LEB	John	7	42	Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? ”
LEB	John	7	43	So there was a division in the crowd because of him .
LEB	John	7	44	And some of them were wanting to seize him , but no one laid hands on him .
LEB	John	7	45	So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees . And they said to them , “ Why [ aa ] did you not bring him ? ”
LEB	John	7	46	The officers replied , “ Never has a man spoken like this ! ”
LEB	John	7	47	Then the Pharisees replied to them , “ You have not also been deceived , have you ? [ ab ]
LEB	John	7	48	None [ ac ] of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed in him , have they ? [ ad ]
LEB	John	7	49	But this crowd who does not know the law is accursed ! ”
LEB	John	7	50	Nicodemus , the one who came to him previously—who was one of them—said to them ,
LEB	John	7	51	“ Our law does not condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing , does it ? ” [ ae ]
LEB	John	7	52	They answered and said to him , “ You are not also from Galilee , are you ? [ af ] Investigate and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee ! ” [ [

LEB	John	8	8	And bending down again , he wrote on the ground .
LEB	John	8	2	Now early in the morning he came again to the temple courts . [ a ] And all the people were coming , [ b ] and he sat down and [ c ] began to teach [ d ] them .
LEB	John	8	3	Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman [ e ] caught in adultery . And standing her in their midst ,
LEB	John	8	4	they said to him , testing him , [ f ] “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery !
LEB	John	8	5	Now in the law , Moses commanded us to stone such women . So what do you say ? ”
LEB	John	8	6	( Now they were saying this to test him , so that they would have an occasion [ g ] to bring charges against him . ) But Jesus , bending down , began to write [ h ] with his [ i ] finger on the ground , taking no notice . [ j ]
LEB	John	8	7	And when they persisted in asking him , straightening up he said [ k ] to them , “ The one of you without sin , let him throw the first stone at her ! ”
LEB	John	8	9	Now when they [ l ] heard it , [ m ] being convicted by their conscience , [ n ] they began to depart , [ o ] one by one , beginning with the older ones , and Jesus [ p ] was left alone—and the woman who was in their midst .
LEB	John	8	10	So Jesus , straightening up and seeing no one except the woman , [ q ] said to her , “ Where are those accusers of yours ? [ r ] Does no one condemn you ? ”
LEB	John	8	11	And she said , “ No one , Lord. ” So Jesus said , “ Neither do I condemn you . Go , and [ s ] sin no more. ” ] ] [ t ] Jesus , the Light of the World
LEB	John	8	12	Then Jesus spoke to them again , saying , “ I am the light of the world ! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life. ”
LEB	John	8	13	So the Pharisees said to him , “ You testify concerning yourself ! Your testimony is not true. ”
LEB	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Even if I testify concerning myself , my testimony is true , because I know where I have come from and where I am going . But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going .
LEB	John	8	15	You judge according to externals ; I do not judge anyone .
LEB	John	8	16	But even if I judge , my judgment is true , because I am not alone , but I and the Father who sent me .
LEB	John	8	17	And even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true . [ u ]
LEB	John	8	18	I am the one who testifies concerning myself , and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me. ”
LEB	John	8	19	So they were saying to him , “ Where is your father ? ” Jesus replied , “ You know neither me nor my Father ! If you had known me , you would have known my Father also. ”
LEB	John	8	20	He spoke these words by the treasury while [ v ] teaching in the temple courts , [ w ] and no one seized him , because his hour had not yet come . Jesus Predicts His Death
LEB	John	8	21	So he said to them again , “ I am going away , and you will seek me and will die in your sin . Where I am going you can not come ! ”
LEB	John	8	22	Then the Jews began to say , [ x ] “ Perhaps he will kill himself , because he is saying , ‘ Where I am going you can not come. ’ ”
LEB	John	8	23	And he said to them , “ You are from below ; I am from above . You are from this world ; I am not from this world .
LEB	John	8	24	Thus I said to you that you will die in your sins . For if you do not believe that I am he , you will die in your sins. ”
LEB	John	8	25	So they began to say to him , [ y ] “ Who are you ? ” Jesus said to them , “ What [ z ] I have been saying to you from the beginning .
LEB	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge concerning you , but the one who sent me is true , and the things which I heard from him , these things I say to the world. ”
LEB	John	8	27	( They did not know that he was speaking to them about the Father . )
LEB	John	8	28	Then Jesus said , [ aa ] “ When you lift up the Son of Man , then you will recognize that I am he , and I do nothing from myself , but just as the Father taught me , I say these things .
LEB	John	8	29	And the one who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , because I always do the things that are pleasing to him. ”
LEB	John	8	30	While [ ab ] he was saying these things , many believed in him . The Truth Will Set You Free
LEB	John	8	31	Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him , “ If you continue in my word you are truly my disciples ,
LEB	John	8	32	and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ”
LEB	John	8	33	They replied to him , “ We are descendants of Abraham and have not been enslaved to anyone at any time . How do you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ”
LEB	John	8	34	Jesus replied to them , “ Truly , truly I say to you , that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin .
LEB	John	8	35	And the slave does not remain in the household forever ; [ ac ] the son remains forever . [ ad ]
LEB	John	8	36	So if the son sets you free , you will be truly free .
LEB	John	8	37	I know that you are descendants of Abraham . But you are seeking to kill me , because my word makes no progress among you .
LEB	John	8	38	I speak the things that I have seen with the Father ; so also you do the things that you have heard from the Father. ” The Priority of Jesus Over Abraham
LEB	John	8	39	They answered and said to him , “ Abraham is our father ! ” Jesus said to them , “ If you are children of Abraham , do the deeds of Abraham !
LEB	John	8	40	But now you are seeking to kill me , a man who spoke to you the truth which I heard from God . This Abraham did not do .
LEB	John	8	41	You are doing the deeds of your father ! ” They said [ ae ] to him , “ We were not born from sexual immorality ! We have one father , God ! ”
LEB	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your father , you would love me , for I have come forth from God and have come . For I have not come from myself , but that one sent me .
LEB	John	8	43	Why [ af ] do you not understand my way of speaking ? Because you are not able to listen to my message .
LEB	John	8	44	You are of your father the devil , and you want to do the desires of your father ! That one was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand firm in the truth , because truth is not in him . Whenever he speaks the lie , he speaks from his own nature , [ ag ] because he is a liar and the father of lies . [ ah ]
LEB	John	8	45	But because I am telling the truth , you do not believe me .
LEB	John	8	46	Who among you convicts me concerning sin ? If I am telling the truth , why [ ai ] do you not believe me ?
LEB	John	8	47	The one who is from God listens to the words of God . Because of this you do not listen—because you are not of God. ”
LEB	John	8	48	The Jews answered and said to him , “ Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon ? ”
LEB	John	8	49	Jesus replied , “ I do not have a demon , but I honor my Father , and you dishonor me !
LEB	John	8	50	But I do not seek my own glory . There is one who seeks and judges !
LEB	John	8	51	Truly , truly I say to you , if anyone keeps my word , he will never experience death forever. ” [ aj ]
LEB	John	8	52	The Jews [ ak ] said to him , “ Now we know that you have a demon ! Abraham and the prophets died , and you say , ‘ If anyone keeps my word , he will never taste death forever. ’ [ al ]
LEB	John	8	53	You are not greater than our father Abraham who died , are you ? [ am ] And the prophets died ! Who do you make yourself to be ? ”
LEB	John	8	54	Jesus replied , “ If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing . The one who glorifies me is my Father , about whom you say , ‘ He is our God. ’
LEB	John	8	55	And you have not known him , but I know him . And if I were to say that I do not know him , I would be a liar like you ! But I know him and I keep his word .
LEB	John	8	56	Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day , and he saw it [ an ] and was glad. ”

LEB	John	9	9	Others were saying , “ It is this man ” ; others were saying , “ No , but he is like him. ” That one was saying , “ I am he ! ”
LEB	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , saying , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he should be born blind ? ”
LEB	John	9	3	Jesus replied , “ Neither this man sinned nor his parents , but it happened [ b ] so that the works of God could be revealed in him .
LEB	John	9	4	It is necessary for us to do the deeds of the one who sent me while it is day ; night is coming , when no one can work !
LEB	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
LEB	John	9	6	When he [ c ] had said these things , he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva , and smeared the clay on his eyes .
LEB	John	9	7	And he said to him , “ Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ” ( which is translated “ sent ” ) . So he went and washed and came back seeing .
LEB	John	9	8	Then the neighbors and those who saw him previously ( because he was a beggar ) began to say , [ d ] “ Is this man not the one who used to sit and beg ? ”
LEB	John	9	10	So they began to say [ e ] to him , “ How [ f ] were your eyes opened ? ”
LEB	John	9	11	He replied , “ The man who is called Jesus made clay and smeared it [ g ] on my eyes and said to me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash ! ’ So I went , and I washed , and [ h ] I received sight. ”
LEB	John	9	12	And they said to him , “ Where is that man ? ” He said , “ I do not know. ” The Reaction of the Pharisees to the Healing
LEB	John	9	13	They brought him—the one formerly blind—to the Pharisees .
LEB	John	9	14	( Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the Sabbath . )
LEB	John	9	15	So the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight . And he said to them , “ He put clay on my eyes , and I washed , and I see. ”
LEB	John	9	16	So some of the Pharisees were saying , “ This man is not from God , because he does not observe the Sabbath ! ” Others [ i ] were saying , “ How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs ? ” And there was a division among them .
LEB	John	9	17	So they said to the blind man again , “ What do you say about him , because he opened your eyes ? ” And he said , “ He is a prophet. ”
LEB	John	9	18	So the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received sight , until they summoned the parents of the one [ j ] who received sight .
LEB	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying , “ Is this man your son , whom you say was born blind ? Then how does he now see ? ”
LEB	John	9	20	So his parents answered and said , “ We know that this man is our son , and that he was born blind .
LEB	John	9	21	But how he now sees we do not know , or who opened his eyes we do not know . Ask him ! He is a mature adult ; [ k ] he will speak for himself ! ”
LEB	John	9	22	( His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews , for the Jews had already decided that if anyone should confess him to be Christ , he would be expelled from the synagogue .
LEB	John	9	23	Because of this his parents said , “ He is a mature adult ; [ l ] ask him. ” )
LEB	John	9	24	So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him , “ Give glory to God ! We know that this man is a sinner ! ”
LEB	John	9	25	Then that man replied , “ Whether he is a sinner I do not know . One thing I know—that although I [ m ] was blind , now I see ! ”
LEB	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
LEB	John	9	27	He replied to them , “ I told you already and you did not listen ! Why do you want to hear it [ n ] again ? You do not want to become his disciples also , do you ? ” [ o ]
LEB	John	9	28	They reviled [ p ] him and said , “ You are his disciple ! But we are disciples of Moses !
LEB	John	9	29	We know that God has spoken to Moses , but we do not know where this man is from. ”
LEB	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , “ For the remarkable thing is this , that you do not know where he is from , and he opened my eyes !
LEB	John	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners , but if someone is devout and does his will , he listens to this one .
LEB	John	9	32	From time immemorial [ q ] it has not been heard that someone opened the eyes of one born blind .
LEB	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he would not be able to do anything ! ”
LEB	John	9	34	They answered and said to him , “ You were born completely in sin , and are you attempting to teach [ r ] us ? ” And they threw him out . Jesus as the Son of Man
LEB	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , and finding him , he said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
LEB	John	9	36	He answered and said , “ And who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? ”

LEB	John	10	10	The thief comes only [ b ] so that he can steal and kill and destroy ; I have come so that they may have life , and have it [ c ] abundantly .
LEB	John	10	2	But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
LEB	John	10	3	For this one the doorkeeper opens , and the sheep hear his voice , and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
LEB	John	10	4	Whenever he sends out all his own , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
LEB	John	10	5	And they will never follow a stranger , but will flee from him , because they do not know the voice of strangers. ”
LEB	John	10	6	Jesus told them this parable , but they did not understand what it was that he was saying to them .
LEB	John	10	7	Then Jesus said to them [ a ] again , “ Truly , truly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .
LEB	John	10	8	All those who came before me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep do not listen to them .
LEB	John	10	9	I am the door . If anyone enters through me , he will be saved , and will come in and will go out and will find pasture .
LEB	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
LEB	John	10	12	The hired hand , who is not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , sees the wolf approaching and abandons the sheep and runs away—and the wolf seizes them and scatters them [ d ] —
LEB	John	10	13	because he is a hired hand and he is not concerned [ e ] about the sheep .
LEB	John	10	14	“ I am the good shepherd , and I know my own , and my own know me ,
LEB	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father , and I lay down my life for the sheep .
LEB	John	10	16	And I have other sheep which are not from this fold . I must bring these also , and they will hear my voice , and they will become one flock—one shepherd .
LEB	John	10	17	Because of this the Father loves me , because I lay down my life so that I may take possession of it again .
LEB	John	10	18	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down voluntarily . [ f ] I have authority to lay it down , and I have authority to take possession of it again . This commandment I received from my Father. ”
LEB	John	10	19	Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words .
LEB	John	10	20	And many of them were saying , “ He has a demon and is out of his mind ! Why do you listen to him ? ”
LEB	John	10	21	Others were saying , “ These are not the words of one who is possessed by a demon ! A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind , is it ? ” [ g ] Jesus at the Feast of the Dedication
LEB	John	10	22	Then the feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem . It was winter ,
LEB	John	10	23	and Jesus was walking in the temple in the Portico of Solomon .
LEB	John	10	24	So the Jews surrounded him and began to say [ h ] to him , “ How long will you keep us in suspense ? [ i ] If you are the Christ , tell us plainly ! ”
LEB	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you and you do not believe ! The deeds that I do in the name of my Father , these testify about me .
LEB	John	10	26	But you do not believe , because you are not of my sheep !
LEB	John	10	27	My sheep listen to my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
LEB	John	10	28	And I give them eternal life , and they will never perish forever , [ j ] and no one will seize them out of my hand .
LEB	John	10	29	My Father , who has given them [ k ] to me , is greater than all , and no one can seize them [ l ] from the Father ’ s hand .
LEB	John	10	30	The Father and I are one. ”
LEB	John	10	31	Then [ m ] the Jews picked up stones again so that they could stone him .
LEB	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , “ I have shown you many good deeds from the Father . For which one of them are you going to stone me ? ”
LEB	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , “ We are not going to stone you concerning a good deed , but concerning blasphemy , and because you , although you [ n ] are a man , make yourself to be God ! ”
LEB	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , “ Is it not written in your law , ‘ I said , “ You are gods ” ’ ? [ o ]
LEB	John	10	35	If he called them ‘ gods ’ to whom the word of God came—and the scripture can not be broken—
LEB	John	10	36	do you say about he whom the Father set apart and sent into the world , ‘ You are blaspheming , ’ because I said , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
LEB	John	10	37	If I do not do the deeds of my Father , do not believe me .
LEB	John	10	38	But if I am doing them , [ p ] even if you do not believe me , believe the deeds , so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
LEB	John	10	39	So they were seeking again to seize him , and he departed out of their hand .
LEB	John	10	40	And he went away again on the other side of the Jordan , to the place where John was baptizing at an earlier time , and he stayed there .
LEB	John	10	41	And many came to him and began to say , [ q ] “ John performed no sign , but everything John said about this man was true ! ”

LEB	John	11	4	And when he [ b ] heard it , [ c ] Jesus said , “ This sickness is not to death , but for the glory of God , in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it. ”
LEB	John	11	5	( Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus . )
LEB	John	11	6	So when he heard that he was sick , then he remained in the place where [ d ] he was two days .
LEB	John	11	7	Then after this he said to the disciples , “ Let us go to Judea again. ”
LEB	John	11	8	The disciples said to him , “ Rabbi , the Jews were seeking just now to stone you , and are you going there again ? ”
LEB	John	11	9	Jesus replied , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If anyone walks around in the daylight , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world .
LEB	John	11	10	But if anyone walks around in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him .
LEB	John	11	12	So the disciples said to him , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will get well. ”
LEB	John	11	13	( Now Jesus had been speaking about his death , but they thought that he was speaking about real sleep . [ e ] )
LEB	John	11	14	So Jesus then said to them plainly , “ Lazarus has died ,
LEB	John	11	15	and I am glad for your sake [ f ] that I was not there , so that you may believe . But let us go to him. ”
LEB	John	11	16	Then Thomas ( the one who is called Didymus ) [ g ] said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us go also , so that we may die with him. ” Jesus the Resurrection and the Life
LEB	John	11	17	So when he [ h ] arrived , Jesus found he had already been four days in the tomb .
LEB	John	11	18	( Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stadia . [ i ]
LEB	John	11	19	So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their [ j ] brother . )
LEB	John	11	20	Now Martha , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went to meet him , but Mary was sitting in the house .
LEB	John	11	21	So Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died .
LEB	John	11	22	Even [ k ] now I know that whatever you ask God , God will grant you. ”
LEB	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother will rise again. ”
LEB	John	11	24	Martha said to him , “ I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day. ”
LEB	John	11	25	Jesus said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . The one who believes in me , even if he dies , will live ,
LEB	John	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die forever . [ l ] Do you believe this ? ”
LEB	John	11	27	She said to him , “ Yes , Lord , I have believed that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who comes into the world. ” Jesus Weeps
LEB	John	11	28	And when she [ m ] had said this , she went and called her sister Mary privately , saying , “ The Teacher is here and is calling for you. ”
LEB	John	11	29	So that one , when she heard it , [ n ] got up quickly and went to him .
LEB	John	11	30	( Now Jesus has not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him . )
LEB	John	11	31	So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her , when they [ o ] saw Mary—that she stood up quickly and went out—followed her , because they [ p ] thought that she was going to the tomb in order to weep there .
LEB	John	11	32	Then Mary , when she came where Jesus was and [ q ] saw him , fell at his feet , saying to him , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
LEB	John	11	33	Then Jesus , when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping , was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself .
LEB	John	11	34	And he said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
LEB	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
LEB	John	11	36	So the Jews were saying , “ See how he loved him ! ”
LEB	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do something [ r ] so that this man also would not have died ? ” Lazarus Is Raised
LEB	John	11	38	Then Jesus , deeply moved within himself again , came to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone was lying on it .
LEB	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone. ” Martha , the sister of the one who had died , said to him , “ Lord , he is stinking already , because it has been four days. ”
LEB	John	11	40	Jesus said to her , “ Did I not say to you that if you believed , you would see the glory of God ? ”
LEB	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up his [ s ] eyes above and said , “ Father , I give thanks to you that you hear me .
LEB	John	11	42	And I know that you always hear me , but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said it , [ t ] so that they may believe that you sent me. ”
LEB	John	11	43	And when he [ u ] had said these things , he cried out with a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
LEB	John	11	44	The one who had died came out , his [ v ] feet and his [ w ] hands bound with strips of cloth , and his face wrapped with a facecloth . Jesus said to them , “ Untie him and let him go. ” The Jewish Leaders Plot to Kill Jesus
LEB	John	11	45	Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw the things which he did believed in him .
LEB	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done .
LEB	John	11	47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said , “ What are we doing ? For this man is performing many signs !
LEB	John	11	48	If we allow him to go on in this way , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place [ x ] and our [ y ] nation. ”
LEB	John	11	49	But a certain one of them , Caiaphas ( who was high priest in that year ) , said to them , “ You do not know anything at all !
LEB	John	11	50	Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people , and the whole nation not perish. ”
LEB	John	11	51	( Now he did not say this from himself , but being high priest in that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ,
LEB	John	11	52	and not for the nation only , but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one . )
LEB	John	11	53	So from that day they resolved that they should kill him .
LEB	John	11	54	So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews , but went away from there to the region near the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim , and there he stayed with the disciples .
LEB	John	11	55	Now the Passover of the Jews was near , and many went up to Jerusalem from the surrounding country before the Passover , so that they could purify themselves .
LEB	John	11	56	So they were looking for Jesus , and were speaking with one another while [ z ] standing in the temple courts , [ aa ] “ What do you think ? That he will not come to the feast ? ”

LEB	John	12	2	So they made him a dinner there , and Martha was serving , but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with him .
LEB	John	12	3	Then Mary took a pound [ a ] of ointment of very valuable genuine nard and [ b ] anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair . And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
LEB	John	12	4	But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples ( the one who was going to betray him ) said ,
LEB	John	12	5	“ Why [ c ] was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor ? ”
LEB	John	12	6	( Now he said this not because he was concerned [ d ] about the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , he used to steal what was put into it . ) [ e ]
LEB	John	12	7	So Jesus said , “ Leave her alone , so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial .
LEB	John	12	8	For you have the poor with you always , but you do not always have me. ” The Decision to Kill Lazarus
LEB	John	12	9	Now a large crowd [ f ] of Jews found out that he was there , and they came , not only because of Jesus , but so that they could see Lazarus also , whom he raised from the dead .
LEB	John	12	10	So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also ,
LEB	John	12	11	because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus . The Triumphal Entry
LEB	John	12	13	took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him , and began crying out , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord , [ h ] even the king of Israel ! ”
LEB	John	12	14	So Jesus found a young donkey and [ i ] sat on it , just as it is written ,
LEB	John	12	15	“ Do not be afraid , daughter of Zion ! Behold , your king is coming , seated on the foal of a donkey ! ” [ j ]
LEB	John	12	16	( His disciples did not understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things had been written about him and they did these things to him . )
LEB	John	12	17	So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify .
LEB	John	12	18	Because of this also the crowd went to meet him , for they had heard that he had performed this sign .
LEB	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another , “ You see that you are accomplishing nothing ! Behold , the world has gone after him. ” Greeks Seeking Jesus
LEB	John	12	20	Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast .
LEB	John	12	21	So these approached Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and began asking him saying , “ Sir , we want to see Jesus. ”
LEB	John	12	22	Philip went and told Andrew . Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus .
LEB	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , saying , “ The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified .
LEB	John	12	24	Truly , truly I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and [ k ] dies , it remains by itself alone . But if it dies , it bears much fruit .
LEB	John	12	25	The one who loves his life loses it , and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life .
LEB	John	12	26	If anyone serves me , he must follow me , and where I am , there my servant will be also . If anyone serves me , the Father will honor him . Jesus Predicts His Death
LEB	John	12	27	“ Now my soul is troubled , and what shall I say ? ‘ Father , deliver me from this hour ’ ? But for this reason I have come to this hour !
LEB	John	12	28	Father , glorify your name ! ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have both glorified it , [ l ] and I will glorify it [ m ] again. ”
LEB	John	12	29	Now the crowd that stood there and heard it [ n ] said it had thundered . [ o ] Others were saying , “ An angel has spoken to him ! ”
LEB	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , “ This voice has not happened for my sake , but for your sake .
LEB	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world ! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out !
LEB	John	12	32	And I , when I am lifted up from the earth , will draw all people to myself. ”
LEB	John	12	33	( Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die . )
LEB	John	12	34	Then the crowd replied to him , “ We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever ! [ p ] And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
LEB	John	12	35	So Jesus said to them , “ Yet a little time the light is with you ! Walk while you have the light , so that the darkness does not overtake you ! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
LEB	John	12	36	While you have the light , believe in the light , in order that you may become sons of light. ” Jesus said these things , and then he went away and [ q ] was hidden from them . The People Still Refuse to Believe
LEB	John	12	37	But as many signs as he had performed before them , they did not believe in him ,
LEB	John	12	38	in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled , who said , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? ” [ r ]
LEB	John	12	39	For this reason they were not able to believe , because again Isaiah said ,
LEB	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts , lest they see with their [ s ] eyes and understand with their [ t ] hearts and turn , and I heal them. ” [ u ]
LEB	John	12	41	Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory , and he spoke about him .
LEB	John	12	42	Yet despite that , even many of the rulers believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it , [ v ] so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue .
LEB	John	12	43	For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God . Jesus ’ Final Public Appeal
LEB	John	12	44	But Jesus cried out and said , “ The one who believes in me does not believe in me , but in the one who sent me ,
LEB	John	12	45	and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me .
LEB	John	12	46	I have come as a light into the world , in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness .
LEB	John	12	47	And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them , [ w ] I will not judge him . For I have not come to judge the world , but to save the world .
LEB	John	12	48	The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him ; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day .
LEB	John	12	49	For I have not spoken from myself , but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me [ x ] what I should say and what I should speak .
LEB	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . So the things that I say , just as the Father said to me , thus I say. ” Footnotes - John 12:3 The Greek term refers to a Roman pound , 327.45 grams ( approximately

LEB	John	13	13	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and you speak correctly , for I am .
LEB	John	13	2	And as [ c ] a dinner was taking place , when [ d ] the devil had already put into the heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot that he should betray him ,
LEB	John	13	3	because he [ e ] knew that the Father had given him all things into his [ f ] hands , and that he had come forth from God and was going away to God ,
LEB	John	13	4	he got up from the dinner and took off his [ g ] outer clothing , and taking a towel , tied it [ h ] around himself .
LEB	John	13	5	Then he poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the feet of the disciples , and to wipe them [ i ] dry with the towel which he had tied around himself . [ j ]
LEB	John	13	6	Then he came to Simon Peter . He said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
LEB	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , “ What I am doing you do not understand now , but you will understand after these things. ”
LEB	John	13	8	Peter said to him , “ You will never wash my feet forever ! ” [ k ] Jesus replied to him , “ Unless I wash you , you do not have a share with me. ”
LEB	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , not my feet only , but also my [ l ] hands and my [ m ] head ! ”
LEB	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ The one who has bathed only needs [ n ] to wash his [ o ] feet , but is completely clean . And you are clean , but not all of you. ”
LEB	John	13	11	( For he knew the one who would betray him ; because of this he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ” )
LEB	John	13	12	So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again , he said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done for you ?
LEB	John	13	14	If then I—your [ p ] Lord and Teacher—wash your feet , you also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
LEB	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that just as I have done for you , you also do .
LEB	John	13	16	Truly , truly I say to you , a slave is not greater than his master , nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
LEB	John	13	17	If you understand these things , you are blessed if you do them .
LEB	John	13	18	“ I am not speaking about all of you . I know whom I have chosen , but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled , ‘ The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me. ’ [ q ]
LEB	John	13	19	From now on I am telling you before it happens , in order that when it happens you may believe that I am he . [ r ]
LEB	John	13	20	Truly , truly I say to you , the one who receives anyone I send receives me , and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me. ” Jesus Predicts Judas ’ Betrayal
LEB	John	13	21	When he [ s ] had said these things , Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said , “ Truly , truly I say to you that one of you will betray me. ”
LEB	John	13	22	The disciples began looking [ t ] at one another , uncertain about whom he was speaking .
LEB	John	13	23	One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining close beside [ u ] Jesus .
LEB	John	13	24	So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking .
LEB	John	13	25	He leaned back [ v ] accordingly against Jesus ’ chest and [ w ] said to him , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
LEB	John	13	26	Jesus replied , “ It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it [ x ] to him. ” Then after [ y ] dipping the piece of bread , he gave it [ z ] [ aa ] to Judas son of Simon Iscariot .
LEB	John	13	27	And after the piece of bread , then Satan entered into him . Then Jesus said to him , “ What you are doing , do quickly ! ”
LEB	John	13	28	( Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what reason he said this to him .
LEB	John	13	29	For some were thinking because Judas had the money box , Jesus was telling him , “ Purchase what we need [ ab ] for the feast , ” or that he should give something to the poor . )
LEB	John	13	30	So after he [ ac ] had taken the piece of bread , he went out immediately . And it was night . Jesus Predicts Peter ’ s Denial
LEB	John	13	31	Then , when he had gone out , Jesus said , “ Now the Son of Man is glorified , and God is glorified in him .
LEB	John	13	32	If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and will glorify him immediately .
LEB	John	13	33	Children , yet a little time I am with you . You will seek me and just as I said to the Jews , “ Where I am going you can not come , ” now I say also to you .
LEB	John	13	34	“ A new commandment I give to you : that you love one another—just as I have loved you , that you also love one another .
LEB	John	13	35	By this everyone will know that you are my disciples—if you have love for one another. ”
LEB	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus replied , [ ad ] “ Where I am going you can not follow me now , but you will follow later. ”
LEB	John	13	37	Peter said to him , “ Lord , why am I not able to follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you ! ”
LEB	John	13	38	Jesus replied , “ Will you lay down your life for me ? Truly , truly I say to you , the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times !

LEB	John	14	14	If you ask me anything in my name , I will do it . [ h ] Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit
LEB	John	14	2	In my Father ’ s house there are many dwelling places ; but if not , I would have told you , because [ c ] I am going away to prepare a place for you .
LEB	John	14	3	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and receive you to myself , so that where I am , you may be also .
LEB	John	14	4	And you know the way where I am going. ”
LEB	John	14	5	Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we do not know where you are going . How are we able to know the way ? ”
LEB	John	14	6	Jesus said to him , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .
LEB	John	14	7	If you had known me , you would have known [ d ] my Father also . From now on [ e ] you know him and have seen him. ”
LEB	John	14	8	Philip said to him , “ Lord , show us the Father , and it is enough for us. ”
LEB	John	14	9	Jesus said to him , “ Am I with you so long a time and you have not known me , Philip ? The one who has seen me has seen the Father ! How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ? ’
LEB	John	14	10	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself , but the Father residing in me does his works .
LEB	John	14	11	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ; but if not , believe because of the works themselves .
LEB	John	14	12	Truly , truly I say to you , the one who believes in me , the works that I am doing he will do also , and he will do greater works [ f ] than these because I am going to the Father .
LEB	John	14	13	And whatever [ g ] you ask in my name , I will do this , in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
LEB	John	14	15	“ If you love me , you will keep my commandments .
LEB	John	14	16	And I will ask the Father , and he will give you another Advocate , in order that he may be with you forever [ i ] —
LEB	John	14	17	the Spirit of truth , whom the world is not able to receive , because it does not see him or know him . [ j ] You know him , because he resides with you and will be in you .

LEB	John	14	19	Yet a little time and the world will see me no longer , but you will see me ; because I live , you also will live .

LEB	John	14	21	The one who has my commandments and keeps them—that one is the one who loves me . And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will reveal myself to him. ”
LEB	John	14	22	Judas ( not Iscariot ) said to him , “ Lord , why [ k ] is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
LEB	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said to him , “ If anyone loves me he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and will take up residence with him . [ l ]

LEB	John	15	15	No longer do I call you slaves , because the slave does not know what his master is doing . But I have called you friends , because everything that I have heard from my Father I have revealed to you .
LEB	John	15	2	Every branch that does not bear fruit in me , he removes it , and every branch that bears fruit , he prunes it in order that it may bear more fruit .
LEB	John	15	3	You are already clean because of the word that I have spoken to you .
LEB	John	15	4	Remain in me , and I in you . Just as the branch is not able to bear fruit from itself unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
LEB	John	15	5	“ I am the vine ; you are the branches . The one who remains in me and I in him—this one bears much fruit , for apart from me you are not able to do anything .

LEB	John	15	12	This is my commandment : that you love one another just as I have loved you .
LEB	John	15	13	No one has greater love than this : that someone lay down his life for his friends .
LEB	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
LEB	John	15	16	You did not choose me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and your fruit should remain , in order that whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you .
LEB	John	15	17	These things I command you : that you love one another . The World ’ s Hatred for the Disciples
LEB	John	15	18	If the world hates you , you know that it has hated me before it hated [ b ] you .
LEB	John	15	19	If you were of the world , the world would love its own . But because you are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , for this reason the world hates you .
LEB	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said to you : ‘ A slave is not greater than his master. ’ If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
LEB	John	15	21	But they will do all these things to you on account of my name , because they do not know the one who sent me .
LEB	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not have sin . But now they do not have a valid excuse for their sin .
LEB	John	15	23	The one who hates me hates my Father also .
LEB	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works that no one else did , they would not have sin . But now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father .
LEB	John	15	25	But this happened [ c ] so that the word that is written in their law would be fulfilled , ‘ They hated me without a reason. ’

LEB	John	16	12	I still have many things to say to you , but you are not able to bear them [ c ] now .
LEB	John	16	13	But when he—the Spirit of truth—comes , he will guide you into all the truth . For he will not speak from himself , but whatever he hears he will speak , and he will proclaim to you the things to come .
LEB	John	16	14	He will glorify me , because he will take from what is mine and will proclaim it [ d ] to you .
LEB	John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is mine . For this reason I said that he takes from what is mine and will proclaim it [ e ] to you . Jesus Predicts His Return to the Disciples
LEB	John	16	17	So some of his disciples said to one another , “ What is this that he is saying to us , ‘ A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me , ’ and ‘ Because I am going away to the Father ’ ? ”
LEB	John	16	18	So they kept on saying , “ What is this that he is saying , ‘ A little while ’ ? We do not understand what he is speaking about ! ”
LEB	John	16	19	Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him , and he said to them , “ Are you deliberating with one another about this—that I said , ‘ A little while , and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me ’ ?
LEB	John	16	20	Truly , truly I say to you , that you will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice ; you will become sorrowful , but your sorrow will change to joy .
LEB	John	16	21	A woman , when she gives birth , experiences pain because her hour has come . But when her [ f ] child is born , she no longer remembers the affliction , on account of the joy that a human being has been born into the world .
LEB	John	16	22	So you also are experiencing sorrow now , but I will see you again , and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will take away your joy from you .
LEB	John	16	23	And on that day you will ask me nothing . Truly , truly I say to you , whatever you ask the Father in my name , he will give you .
LEB	John	16	24	Until now you have asked nothing in my name . Ask and you will receive , so that your joy may be complete . Jesus ’ Victory Over the World
LEB	John	16	25	“ I have said these things to you in figurative sayings . An hour is coming when I will speak to you in figurative sayings no longer , but I will tell you plainly about the Father .
LEB	John	16	26	On that day you will ask in my name , and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf .
LEB	John	16	27	For the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God .
LEB	John	16	28	I have gone out from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I am leaving the world and am going to the Father. ”
LEB	John	16	29	His disciples said , “ Behold , now you are speaking plainly [ g ] and are telling us [ h ] no figurative saying !
LEB	John	16	30	Now we know that you know everything and do not need for [ i ] anyone to ask you questions . [ j ] By this we believe that you have come from God. ”
LEB	John	16	31	Jesus replied to them , “ Now do you believe ?
LEB	John	16	32	Behold , an hour is coming—and has come—that you will be scattered each one to his own home , [ k ] and you will leave me alone . And I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
LEB	John	16	33	I have said these things to you so that in me you may have peace . In the world you have affliction , but have courage ! I have conquered the world. ” Footnotes - John 16:2 Literally “ they will make you expelled from the synagogue ” - John 16:8 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ comes ” ) which is understood as temporal - John 16:12 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - John 16:14 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - John 16:15 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - John 16:21 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - John 16:29 Literally “ with plainness ” - John 16:29 Here the direct object is supplied from context in the English translation - John 16:30 Literally “ have need that ” - John 16:30 * Here the word “ questions ” is not in the Greek text but is implied - John 16:32 Or “ to his own things ” ; or “ to his own people ” ( i.e. , family ) ; the Greek text is somewhat ambiguous here

LEB	John	18	2	( Now Judas , the one who betrayed him , also knew about the place , because Jesus often gathered there with his disciples . )
LEB	John	18	3	So Judas , taking the cohort and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees , came there with lanterns and torches and weapons .
LEB	John	18	4	Then Jesus , because he [ b ] knew all the things that were coming upon him , went out and said to them , “ Who are you looking for ? ”
LEB	John	18	5	They replied to him , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ” He said to them , “ I am he. ” [ c ] ( Now Judas , the one who betrayed him , was also standing with them . )
LEB	John	18	6	So when he said to them , “ I am he , ” [ d ] they drew back [ e ] and fell to the ground .
LEB	John	18	7	Then he asked them again , “ Who are you looking for ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazarene. ”
LEB	John	18	8	Jesus replied , “ I said to you that I am he ! [ f ] So if you are looking for me , let these men go , ”
LEB	John	18	9	in order that the word that he had spoken would be fulfilled : “ Those whom you have given to me—I have not lost anyone of them. ” [ g ]
LEB	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear . ( Now the name of the slave was Malchus . )
LEB	John	18	11	So Jesus said to Peter , “ Put the sword into its [ h ] sheath ! The cup that the Father has given me—shall I not drink it ? ” Jesus Taken to Annas
LEB	John	18	12	Then the cohort and the military tribune and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up ,
LEB	John	18	13	and brought him [ i ] to Annas first , for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year .
LEB	John	18	14	( Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better that one man die for the people . ) Peter Denies Jesus the First Time
LEB	John	18	15	So Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus . ( Now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest . )
LEB	John	18	16	But Peter was standing by the door outside . So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in .
LEB	John	18	17	Then the female slave who was the doorkeeper said to Peter , “ You are not also one of the disciples of this man , are you ? ” [ j ] He said , “ I am not ! ”
LEB	John	18	19	So the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching .
LEB	John	18	20	Jesus replied to him , “ I have spoken openly to the world . I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple courts [ k ] where all the Jews assemble , and I have said nothing in secret .
LEB	John	18	21	Why are you asking me ? Ask those who heard what I have said to them ! Behold , these people know what I said. ”
LEB	John	18	22	Now when [ l ] he had said these things , one of the officers who was standing by gave a slap in the face to Jesus , saying , “ Do you reply to the high priest in this way ? ”
LEB	John	18	23	Jesus replied to him , “ If I have spoken wrongly , testify about what is wrong ! But if I have spoken [ m ] correctly , why do you strike me ? ”
LEB	John	18	24	Then Annas sent him , tied up , to Caiaphas the high priest . Peter Denies Jesus the Second and Third Times
LEB	John	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing there and warming himself . So they said to him , “ You are not also one of his disciples , are you ? ” [ n ] He denied it [ o ] and said , “ I am not ! ”
LEB	John	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest , who was related to the one whose ear Peter had cut off , said , “ Did I not see you in the garden with him ? ”
LEB	John	18	27	So Peter denied it [ p ] again , and immediately a rooster crowed . Jesus Brought Before Pilate
LEB	John	18	28	Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor ’ s residence . Now it was early , and they did not enter into the governor ’ s residence so that they would not be defiled , but could eat the Passover .
LEB	John	18	29	So Pilate came outside to them and said , “ What accusation do you bring against this man ? ”
LEB	John	18	30	They answered and said to him , “ If this man were not doing evil , we would not have handed him over to you ! ”
LEB	John	18	31	So Pilate said to them , “ You take him and judge him according to your law ! ” The Jews said to him , “ It is not permitted for us to kill anyone , ”
LEB	John	18	32	in order that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled that he had spoken , indicating by what sort of death he was going to die . Pilate Questions Jesus
LEB	John	18	33	Then Pilate entered again into the governor ’ s residence and summoned Jesus and said to him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ”
LEB	John	18	34	Jesus replied , “ Do you say this from yourself , or have others said this [ q ] to you about me ? ”
LEB	John	18	35	Pilate replied , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? [ r ] Your people and the chief priests handed you over to me ! What have you done ? ”
LEB	John	18	36	Jesus replied , “ My kingdom is not of this world . If my kingdom were of this world , my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews . But now my kingdom is not from here. ”
LEB	John	18	37	Then Pilate said to him , “ So then you are a king ! ” Jesus replied , “ You say that I am a king . For this reason I was born , and for this reason I have come into the world : in order that I can testify to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice. ”
LEB	John	18	38	Pilate said to him , “ What is truth ? ” And when he [ s ] had said this , he went out again to the Jews and said to them , “ I find no basis for an accusation against him .
LEB	John	18	39	But it is your custom that I release for you one prisoner [ t ] at the Passover . So do you want me [ u ] to release for you the king of the Jews ? ”

LEB	John	19	19	And Pilate also wrote a notice and placed it [ f ] on the cross , and it was written : “ Jesus the Nazarene , the king of the Jews. ”
LEB	John	19	2	And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and placed it [ b ] on his head , and put a purple robe on him ,
LEB	John	19	3	and were coming up to him and saying , “ Hail , king of the Jews ! ” and were giving him slaps in the face .
LEB	John	19	4	And Pilate came outside again and said to them , “ Behold , I am bringing him outside to you , so that you will know that I find no basis for an accusation against him. ”
LEB	John	19	5	Then Jesus came outside wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe , and he said to them , “ Behold the man ! ”
LEB	John	19	6	So when they saw him , the chief priests and the officers shouted , saying , “ Crucify ! Crucify ! ” Pilate said to them , “ You take him and crucify him ! [ c ] For I do not find a basis for an accusation against him. ”
LEB	John	19	7	The Jews replied to him , “ We have a law , and according to the law he ought to die , because he made himself out to be the Son of God ! ”
LEB	John	19	8	So when Pilate heard this statement , he was even more afraid ,
LEB	John	19	9	and he entered into the governor ’ s residence again and said to Jesus , “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus did not give him an answer .
LEB	John	19	10	So Pilate said to him , “ Will you not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have authority to release you , and I have authority to crucify you ? ”
LEB	John	19	11	Jesus replied to him , “ You would not have any authority over me unless it was given to you from above . For this reason the one who handed me over to you has greater sin. ”
LEB	John	19	12	ounces )
LEB	John	19	13	So Pilate , when he [ d ] heard these words , brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat , in the place called The Stone Pavement ( but Gabbatha in Aramaic ) .
LEB	John	19	14	( Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover ; it was about the sixth hour . ) And he said to the Jews , “ Behold your king ! ”
LEB	John	19	15	Then those shouted , “ Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your king ? ” The chief priests replied , “ We do not have a king except Caesar ! ”
LEB	John	19	16	So then he handed him over to them in order that he could be crucified . Jesus Is Crucified So they took Jesus ,
LEB	John	19	17	and carrying for himself the cross , he went out to the place called The Place of a Skull ( which is called Golgotha in Aramaic ) ,
LEB	John	19	18	where they crucified him , and with him two others , one on each side , [ e ] and Jesus in the middle .
LEB	John	19	20	So many of the Jews read this notice , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city . And it was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek .
LEB	John	19	21	Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write ‘ The king of the Jews , ’ but , ‘ He said , I am king of the Jews. ’ ”
LEB	John	19	22	Pilate replied , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
LEB	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his clothing and made four shares—for each soldier a share—and the tunic . ( Now the tunic was seamless , woven from the top in a single piece . ) [ g ]
LEB	John	19	24	So they said to one another , “ Let us not tear it apart , but cast lots for it , to see whose it will be , ” so that the scripture would be fulfilled that says , “ They divided my garments among themselves , and for my clothing they cast lots. ” [ h ] Thus the soldiers did these things .
LEB	John	19	25	Now his mother and the sister of his mother , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene were standing near the cross of Jesus .
LEB	John	19	26	So Jesus , seeing his [ i ] mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there , said to his [ j ] mother , “ Woman , behold your son ! ”
LEB	John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple , “ Behold your mother ! ” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home . Jesus Dies on the Cross
LEB	John	19	28	After this , Jesus , knowing that now at last everything was completed , in order that the scripture would be fulfilled , said , “ I am thirsty. ”
LEB	John	19	29	A jar full of sour wine was standing there , so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and [ k ] brought it [ l ] to his mouth .
LEB	John	19	30	Then when he had received the sour wine , Jesus said , “ It is completed , ” [ m ] and bowing his [ n ] head , he gave up his [ o ] spirit .
LEB	John	19	31	Then the Jews , because it was the day of preparation , so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath ( for that Sabbath was an important day ) , asked Pilate that their legs could be broken and they could be taken away .
LEB	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who had been crucified with him .
LEB	John	19	33	But when they [ p ] came to Jesus , after they saw he was already dead , they did not break his legs .
LEB	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and blood and water came out immediately .
LEB	John	19	35	And the one who has seen it [ q ] has testified , and his testimony is true , and that person knows that he is telling the truth , so that you also may believe .
LEB	John	19	36	For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled : “ Not a bone of his will be broken. ” [ r ]
LEB	John	19	37	And again another scripture says , “ They will look on the one whom they have pierced. ” [ s ] Jesus Is Buried
LEB	John	19	38	And after these things , Joseph who was from Arimathea , who was a disciple of Jesus ( but a secret one for fear of the Jews ) , asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus . And Pilate allowed it , [ t ] so he came and took away his body .
LEB	John	19	39	And Nicodemus—the one who had come to him formerly at night—also came , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds . [ u ]
LEB	John	19	40	So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in strips of linen cloth with the fragrant spices , as is the Jews ’ custom to prepare for burial .
LEB	John	19	41	Now there was a garden at the place where he was crucified , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one was yet buried .
LEB	John	19	42	So there , on account of the day of preparation of the Jews , because the tomb was close by , they buried Jesus .

LEB	John	20	20	And when he [ i ] had said this , he showed his [ j ] hands and his [ k ] side to them . Then the disciples rejoiced when they [ l ] saw the Lord .
LEB	John	20	2	So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them , “ They have taken away the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they have put him ! ”
LEB	John	20	3	Then Peter and the other disciple went out and were going to the tomb .
LEB	John	20	4	And the two were running together , and the other disciple ran ahead , faster than Peter , and came to the tomb first .
LEB	John	20	5	And bending over to look , he saw the strips of linen cloth lying there , though he did not go in .

LEB	John	20	7	and the facecloth that was on his head—not lying with the strips of linen cloth , but folded up separately in one place .

LEB	John	20	12	and she saw two angels in white , seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying .
LEB	John	20	13	And they said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She said to them , “ They have taken away my Lord , and I do not know where they have put him ! ”
LEB	John	20	14	When she [ c ] had said these things , she turned around [ d ] and saw Jesus standing there , and she did not know that it was Jesus .
LEB	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Who are you looking for ? ” She thought that it was the gardener , and [ e ] said to him , “ Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him , and I will take him. ”
LEB	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary. ” She turned around and [ f ] said to him in Aramaic , “ Rabboni ” ( which means “ Teacher ” ) .

LEB	John	20	19	Now when it [ h ] was evening on that day—the first day of the week—and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them , “ Peace to you. ”
LEB	John	20	21	So Jesus said to them again , “ Peace to you . As the Father has sent me , I also send you. ”
LEB	John	20	22	And when he [ m ] had said this , he breathed on them [ n ] and said to them , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
LEB	John	20	23	If you forgive the sins of any , they are forgiven them . If you retain the sins [ o ] of any , they are retained. ” Thomas Doubts But Later Believes
LEB	John	20	24	Now Thomas , one of the twelve , who was called Didymus , [ p ] was not with them when Jesus came .
LEB	John	20	25	So the other disciples said to him , “ We have seen the Lord ! ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails , and put my finger into the mark of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will never believe ! ”
LEB	John	20	26	And after eight days his disciples were again inside , and Thomas with them . Although [ q ] the doors had been shut , Jesus came and stood in their midst and said , “ Peace to you. ”
LEB	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Place your finger here and see my hands , and place your hand and put it [ r ] into my side . And do not be unbelieving , but believing ! ”
LEB	John	20	28	Thomas answered and said to him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
LEB	John	20	29	Jesus said to him , “ Because you have seen me , have you believed ? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed. ” Why This Book Was Written
LEB	John	20	30	Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of the disciples [ s ] which are not recorded in this book ,
LEB	John	20	31	but these things are recorded in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that by [ t ] believing you may have life in his name .

LEB	John	21	21	So when he [ u ] saw this one , Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , but what about this one ? ”
LEB	John	21	2	Simon Peter and Thomas ( who was called Didymus ) [ b ] and Nathanael from Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of his disciples were together .
LEB	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing ! ” They said to him , “ We also are coming with you. ” They went out and got into the boat , and during that night they caught nothing .
LEB	John	21	4	Now when it [ c ] was already early morning , Jesus stood on the beach . However , the disciples did not know that it was Jesus .
LEB	John	21	5	So Jesus said to them , “ Children , you do not have any fish to eat , do you ? [ d ] They answered him , “ No. ”
LEB	John	21	6	And he said to them , “ Throw the net on the right side of the boat , and you will find some. ” [ e ] So they threw it , [ f ] and were no longer able to haul it in from the large number of the fish .
LEB	John	21	7	Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord ! ” So Simon Peter , when he [ g ] heard that it was the Lord , tied around himself his outer garment ( for he was naked ) [ h ] and threw himself into the sea .
LEB	John	21	8	But the other disciples came in the boat , dragging the net of fish , because they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits [ i ] away .
LEB	John	21	9	So when they got out on the land , they saw a charcoal fire laid there , and a fish lying on it , [ j ] and bread .
LEB	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught. ”
LEB	John	21	11	So Simon Peter got into the boat [ k ] and hauled the net to the land , full of large fish—one hundred fifty-three—and although there [ l ] were so many , the net was not torn .
LEB	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come , eat breakfast ! ” But none of the disciples dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they [ m ] knew that it was the Lord .
LEB	John	21	13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it [ n ] to them , and the fish likewise .
LEB	John	21	14	This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he [ o ] had been raised from the dead . Peter Is Restored Three Times
LEB	John	21	15	Now when they had eaten breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” He said to him , “ Feed my lambs ! ”
LEB	John	21	16	He said to him again a second time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” He said to him , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” He said to him , “ Shepherd my sheep ! ”
LEB	John	21	17	He said to him a third time , “ Simon son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was distressed because he said to him a third time , “ Do you love me ? ” and he said to him , “ Lord , you know everything ! You know that I love you ! ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed my sheep !

LEB	John	21	19	( Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God . ) And after he [ r ] had said this , he said to him , “ Follow me ! ” Peter and the Other Disciple Jesus Loved
LEB	John	21	20	Peter turned and [ s ] saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them [ t ] ( who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said , “ Lord , who is the one betraying you ? ” )
LEB	John	21	22	Jesus said to him , “ If I want him to remain until I come , what is that [ v ] to you ? You follow me ! ”
LEB	John	21	23	So this saying went out to the brothers that that disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say to him that he would not die , but “ If I want him to remain until I come , what is that [ w ] to you ? ” A Concluding Word of Testimony
LEB	John	21	24	This is the disciple who is testifying about these things , and who has written down these things . And we know that his testimony is true .

LEB	Romans	1	1	Paul , a slave of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle , set apart for the gospel of God ,
LEB	Romans	1	2	which he promised previously through his prophets in the holy scriptures ,
LEB	Romans	1	3	concerning his Son , who was born a descendant [ a ] of David according to the flesh ,
LEB	Romans	1	4	who was declared Son of God in power according to the Holy Spirit [ b ] by the resurrection from the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord ,
LEB	Romans	1	5	through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles [ c ] on behalf of his name ,
LEB	Romans	1	6	among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ .
LEB	Romans	1	7	To all those in Rome who are loved by God , called to be saints . Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Paul Wants to Visit Rome
LEB	Romans	1	8	First , I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world .
LEB	Romans	1	9	For God , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , is my witness , how constantly I make mention of you ,
LEB	Romans	1	10	always asking in my prayers if somehow now at last I may succeed to come to you in the will of God .
LEB	Romans	1	11	For I desire to see you , in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you , in order to strengthen you ,
LEB	Romans	1	12	that is , to be encouraged together with you through our mutual faith [ d ] , both yours and mine .
LEB	Romans	1	13	Now I do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , that often I intended to come to you , and was prevented until now , in order that I might have some fruit among you also , just as also among the rest of the Gentiles . [ e ]
LEB	Romans	1	14	I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians , both to the wise and to the foolish .
LEB	Romans	1	15	Thus I am eager [ f ] to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in Rome . The Gospel ’ s Power for Salvation
LEB	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel , for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes , to the Jew first and also to the Greek .
LEB	Romans	1	17	For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith , just as it is written , “ But the one who is righteous by faith will live. ” [ g ] God ’ s Wrath Revealed Against Sinful Humanity
LEB	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people , who suppress the truth in unrighteousness ,
LEB	Romans	1	19	because what can be known about God is evident among [ h ] them , for God made it clear to them .
LEB	Romans	1	20	For from the creation of the world , his invisible attributes , both his eternal power and deity , are discerned clearly , being understood in the things created , so that they are without excuse .
LEB	Romans	1	21	For although they knew God , they did not honor him as God or give thanks , but they became futile in their reasoning , and their senseless hearts were darkened .
LEB	Romans	1	22	Claiming to be wise , they became fools ,
LEB	Romans	1	23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles .
LEB	Romans	1	24	Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality , that their bodies would be dishonored among themselves ,
LEB	Romans	1	25	who exchanged the truth of God with a lie , and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator , who is blessed for eternity . Amen . God Hands Sinful Humanity over to Depravity
LEB	Romans	1	26	Because of this , God gave them over to degrading passions , for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature ,
LEB	Romans	1	27	and likewise also the males , abandoning the natural relations with the female , were inflamed in their desire toward one another , males with males committing the shameless deed , and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error .
LEB	Romans	1	28	And just as they did not see fit to recognize God [ i ] , God gave them over to a debased mind , to do the things that are not proper ,
LEB	Romans	1	29	being filled with all unrighteousness , wickedness , greediness , malice , full of envy , murder , strife , deceit , malevolence . They are gossipers ,
LEB	Romans	1	30	slanderers , haters of God , insolent , arrogant , boasters , contrivers of evil , disobedient to parents ,
LEB	Romans	1	31	senseless , faithless , unfeeling , unmerciful ,

LEB	Romans	2	2	Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things .
LEB	Romans	2	3	But do you think this , O man who passes judgment on those who do such things , and who does the same things , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
LEB	Romans	2	4	Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience , not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance ?
LEB	Romans	2	5	But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart , you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God ,
LEB	Romans	2	6	who will reward each one according to his works :
LEB	Romans	2	7	to those who , by perseverance in good work , seek glory and honor and immortality , eternal life ,
LEB	Romans	2	8	but to those who act from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth , but who obey unrighteousness , wrath and anger .
LEB	Romans	2	9	There will be affliction and distress for every human being [ a ] who does evil , of the Jew first and of the Greek ,
LEB	Romans	2	10	but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good , to the Jew first and to the Greek .
LEB	Romans	2	11	For there is no partiality with God .
LEB	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law , and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law .
LEB	Romans	2	13	For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God , but the doers of the law will be declared righteous . [ b ]
LEB	Romans	2	14	For whenever the Gentiles , who do not have the law , do by nature the things of the law , these , although they [ c ] do not have the law , are a law to themselves ,
LEB	Romans	2	15	who show the work of the law written on their hearts , their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts one after another accusing or even defending them
LEB	Romans	2	16	on the day when God judges the secret things of people , according to my gospel , through [ d ] Christ Jesus . Jews also Condemned by the Law
LEB	Romans	2	17	But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God
LEB	Romans	2	18	and know his will and approve the things that are superior , because you [ e ] are instructed by the law ,
LEB	Romans	2	19	and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light of those in darkness ,
LEB	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of the immature , having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law .
LEB	Romans	2	21	Therefore , the one who teaches someone else , do you not teach yourself ? The one who preaches not to steal , do you steal ?
LEB	Romans	2	22	The one who says not to commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? The one who abhors idols , do you rob temples ?
LEB	Romans	2	23	Who boast in the law , by the transgression of the law you dishonor God ! [ f ]
LEB	Romans	2	24	For just as it is written , “ The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you. ” [ g ]
LEB	Romans	2	25	For circumcision is of value if you do the law , but if you should be a transgressor of the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision .
LEB	Romans	2	26	Therefore , if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law , will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision ?
LEB	Romans	2	27	And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who , though provided with the precise written code [ h ] and circumcision are a transgressor of the law .
LEB	Romans	2	28	For the Jew is not one outwardly [ i ] , nor is circumcision outwardly [ j ] , in the flesh .
LEB	Romans	2	29	But the Jew is one inwardly [ k ] , and circumcision is of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the letter , whose praise is not from people but from God .

LEB	Romans	3	3	What is the result [ a ] if some refused to believe ? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God , will it ?
LEB	Romans	3	2	Much in every way . For first , that they were entrusted with the oracles of God .
LEB	Romans	3	4	May it never be ! But let God be true but every human being a liar , just as it is written ,
LEB	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? God , who inflicts wrath , is not unjust , is he ? ( I am speaking according to a human perspective . )
LEB	Romans	3	6	May it never be ! For otherwise , how will God judge the world ?
LEB	Romans	3	7	But if by my lying , the truth of God abounded to his glory , why am I also still condemned as a sinner ?
LEB	Romans	3	8	And why not ( as we are slandered , and as some affirm that we say ) , “ Let us do evil , in order that good may come of it ? Their [ d ] condemnation is just ! The Entire World Guilty of Sin
LEB	Romans	3	9	What then ? Do we have an advantage ? Not at all . For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin ,
LEB	Romans	3	10	just as it is written , “ There is no one righteous , not even one ;
LEB	Romans	3	11	there is no one who understands ; there is no one who seeks God .
LEB	Romans	3	12	All have turned aside together ; they have become worthless ; There is no one who practices kindness ; there is not even one . [ e ]
LEB	Romans	3	13	Their throat is an opened grave ; they deceive with their tongues ; the venom of asps is under their lips , [ f ]
LEB	Romans	3	14	whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness . [ g ]
LEB	Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
LEB	Romans	3	16	destruction and distress are in their paths ,
LEB	Romans	3	17	and they have not known the way of peace . [ h ]
LEB	Romans	3	18	The fear of God is not before their eyes. ” [ i ]
LEB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the law says , it speaks to those under the law , in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God .
LEB	Romans	3	20	For by the works of the law no person will be declared righteous [ j ] before him , for through the law comes knowledge of sin . Righteousness through Faith Revealed
LEB	Romans	3	21	But now , apart from the law , the righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified about by the law and the prophets—
LEB	Romans	3	22	that is , the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ [ k ] to all who believe . For there is no distinction ,
LEB	Romans	3	23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
LEB	Romans	3	24	being justified as a gift by his grace , through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus ,
LEB	Romans	3	25	whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat [ l ] through faith in his blood , for a demonstration of his righteousness , because of the passing over of previously committed sins ,
LEB	Romans	3	26	in the forbearance of God , for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time , so that he should be just and the one who justifies the person by faith [ m ] in Jesus .
LEB	Romans	3	27	Therefore , where is boasting ? It has been excluded . By what kind of law ? Of works ? No , but by a law [ n ] of faith .
LEB	Romans	3	28	For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
LEB	Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of the Jews only ? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , also of the Gentiles ,
LEB	Romans	3	30	since God is one , who will justify those who are circumcised [ o ] by faith and those who are uncircumcised [ p ] through faith .
LEB	Romans	3	31	Therefore , do we nullify the law through faith ? May it never be ! But we uphold the law .

LEB	Romans	4	4	Now to the one who works , his pay is not credited according to grace , but according to his due .
LEB	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not before God .
LEB	Romans	4	3	For what does the scripture say ? “ And Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him for righteousness. ” [ a ]
LEB	Romans	4	5	But to the one who does not work , but who believes in the one who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited for righteousness ,
LEB	Romans	4	6	just as David also speaks about the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
LEB	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are they whose lawless deeds have been forgiven , and whose sins are covered over .
LEB	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the person against whom the Lord will never count sin. ” [ b ]
LEB	Romans	4	9	Therefore , is this blessing for those who are circumcised [ c ] , or also for those who are uncircumcised [ d ] ? For we say , “ Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness. ” [ e ]
LEB	Romans	4	10	How then was it credited ? While he [ f ] was circumcised [ g ] or uncircumcised [ h ] ? Not while circumcised [ i ] but while uncircumcised [ j ] !
LEB	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal [ k ] of the righteousness by faith which he had while uncircumcised [ l ] , so that he could be the father of all who believe although they are uncircumcised [ m ] , so that righteousness could be credited to them , [ n ]
LEB	Romans	4	12	and the father of those who are circumcised [ o ] to those who are not only from the circumcision , but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised [ p ] . The Promise to Abraham Secured through Faith
LEB	Romans	4	13	For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants , that he would be heir of the world , was not through the law , but through the righteousness by faith .
LEB	Romans	4	14	For if those of the law are heirs , faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified .
LEB	Romans	4	15	For the law produces wrath , but where there is no law , neither is there transgression .
LEB	Romans	4	16	Because of this , it is by faith , in order that it may be according to grace , so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants , not only to those of the law , but also to those of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all
LEB	Romans	4	17	( just as it is written , “ I have made you the father of many nations ” ) [ q ] before God , in whom he believed , the one who makes the dead alive and who calls the things that are not as though they are ,
LEB	Romans	4	18	who against hope believed in hope , so that he became the father of many nations , according to what was said , “ so will your descendants be. ” [ r ]
LEB	Romans	4	19	And not being weak in faith , he considered his own body as good as dead , [ s ] because he [ t ] was approximately a hundred years old , and the deadness of Sarah ’ s womb .
LEB	Romans	4	20	And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God , but was strengthened in faith , giving glory to God

LEB	Romans	5	5	and hope does not disappoint , because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
LEB	Romans	5	2	through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand , and we boast in the hope of the glory of God .
LEB	Romans	5	3	And not only this , but we also boast in our afflictions , because we [ c ] know that affliction produces patient endurance ,
LEB	Romans	5	4	and patient endurance , proven character , and proven character , hope ,
LEB	Romans	5	6	For while [ d ] we were still helpless , yet at the proper time Christ died for the ungodly .
LEB	Romans	5	7	For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person ( for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die ) ,
LEB	Romans	5	8	but God demonstrates his own love for us , in that while [ e ] we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
LEB	Romans	5	9	Therefore , by much more , because we [ f ] have been declared righteous now by his blood , we will be saved through him from the wrath .
LEB	Romans	5	10	For if , while we [ g ] were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , by much more , having been reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
LEB	Romans	5	11	And not only this , but also we are boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received the reconciliation . Death Came through Adam but Life Comes through Christ
LEB	Romans	5	12	Because of this , just as sin entered into the world through one man , and death through sin , so also death spread to all people because all sinned .
LEB	Romans	5	13	For until the law , sin was in the world , but sin is not charged to one ’ s account when there [ h ] is no law .
LEB	Romans	5	14	But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam , who is a type of the one who is to come .
LEB	Romans	5	15	But the gift is not like the trespass [ i ] , for if by the trespass of the one , the many died , by much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , multiply to the many .
LEB	Romans	5	16	And the gift is not as through the one who sinned , for on the one hand , judgment from the one sin led to condemnation , but the gift , from many trespasses , led to justification .
LEB	Romans	5	17	For if by the trespass of the one man , death reigned through the one man , much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one , Jesus Christ .
LEB	Romans	5	18	Consequently therefore , as through one trespass came condemnation to all people , so also through one righteous deed came justification of life to all people .
LEB	Romans	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man , the many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one , the many will be made righteous .
LEB	Romans	5	20	Now the law came in as a side issue , in order that the trespass could increase , but where sin increased , grace was present in greater abundance ,
LEB	Romans	5	21	so that just as sin reigned in death , so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .

LEB	Romans	6	6	knowing this , that our old man was crucified together with him , in order that the body of sin may be done away with , that we may no longer be enslaved to sin .
LEB	Romans	6	2	May it never be ! How can we who died to sin still live in it ?
LEB	Romans	6	3	Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
LEB	Romans	6	4	Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death , in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so also we may live a new way of life [ a ] .
LEB	Romans	6	5	For if we have become identified with him in the likeness of his death , certainly also we will be identified with him in the likeness [ b ] of his resurrection ,
LEB	Romans	6	7	For the one who has died has been freed from sin .
LEB	Romans	6	8	Now if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him ,
LEB	Romans	6	9	knowing that Christ , because he [ c ] has been raised from the dead , is going to die no more , death no longer being master over him .
LEB	Romans	6	10	For that death he died , he died to sin once and never again , but that life he lives , he lives to God .
LEB	Romans	6	11	So also you , consider yourselves to be dead to sin , but alive to God in Christ Jesus .
LEB	Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body , so that you obey its desires ,
LEB	Romans	6	13	and do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness , but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead , and your members to God as instruments of righteousness .
LEB	Romans	6	14	For sin will not be master over you , because you are not under law , but under grace . Set Free from Sin
LEB	Romans	6	15	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace ? May it never be !
LEB	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that to whomever you present yourselves as slaves for obedience , you are slaves to whomever you obey , whether sin , leading to death , or obedience , leading to righteousness ?
LEB	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God that you were slaves of sin , but you have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted ,
LEB	Romans	6	18	and having been set free from sin , you became enslaved to righteousness .
LEB	Romans	6	19	( I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh . ) For just as you presented your members as slaves to immorality and lawlessness , leading to lawlessness , so now present your members as slaves to righteousness , leading to sanctification .
LEB	Romans	6	20	For when you were slaves of sin , you were free with respect to righteousness .
LEB	Romans	6	21	Therefore what sort of fruit did you have then , about which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
LEB	Romans	6	22	But now , having been set free from sin and having been enslaved to God , you have your fruit leading to sanctification , and its end is eternal life .
LEB	Romans	6	23	For the compensation due sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .

LEB	Romans	7	7	What then shall we say ? Is the law sin ? May it never be ! But I would not have known sin except through the law , for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said , “ Do not covet. ” [ d ]
LEB	Romans	7	2	For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives , but if her husband dies , she is released from the law of the husband .
LEB	Romans	7	3	Therefore as a result , if she belongs to another man while [ a ] her husband is living , she will be called an adulteress . But if her husband dies , she is free from the law , so that she is not an adulteress if she [ b ] belongs to another man .
LEB	Romans	7	4	So then , my brothers , you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ , so that you may belong to another , to the one who was raised from the dead , in order that we may bear fruit for God .
LEB	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , sinful desires were working through the law in our members , to bear fruit for death .
LEB	Romans	7	6	But now we have been released from the law , because we [ c ] have died to that by which we were bound , so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter of the law . Knowledge of Sin Comes through the Law
LEB	Romans	7	8	But sin , seizing an opportunity through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of covetousness . For apart from the law , sin is dead .
LEB	Romans	7	9	And I was alive once , apart from the law , but when [ e ] the commandment came , sin sprang to life
LEB	Romans	7	10	and I died , and this commandment which was to lead to life was found with respect to me to lead to death .
LEB	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing the opportunity through the commandment , deceived me and through it killed me .
LEB	Romans	7	12	So then , the law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good . Internal Conflict with Sin
LEB	Romans	7	13	Therefore , did that which is good become death to me ? May it never be ! Rather it was sin , in order that it might be recognized as sin , producing death through what is good for me , in order that sin might become sinful to an extraordinary degree through the commandment .
LEB	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual , but I am fleshly , sold into slavery to sin [ f ] .
LEB	Romans	7	15	For what I am doing I do not understand , because what I want to do , this I do not practice , but what I hate , this I do .
LEB	Romans	7	16	But if what I do not want to do , this I do , I agree with the law that it is good .
LEB	Romans	7	17	But now I am no longer the one doing it , but sin that lives in me .
LEB	Romans	7	18	For I know that good does not live in me , that is , in my flesh . For the willing is present in me , but the doing of the good is not .
LEB	Romans	7	19	For the good that I want to do , I do not do , but the evil that I do not want to do , this I do .
LEB	Romans	7	20	But if what I do not want to do , this I am doing , I am no longer the one doing it , but sin that lives in me .
LEB	Romans	7	21	Consequently , I find the principle with me , the one who wants to do good , that evil is present with me . [ g ]
LEB	Romans	7	22	For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person ,
LEB	Romans	7	23	but I observe another law in my members , at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members .
LEB	Romans	7	24	Wretched man that I am ! Who will rescue me from this body of death ?
LEB	Romans	7	25	Thanks be [ h ] to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself with my mind am enslaved to the law of God , but with my flesh I am enslaved to the law of sin .

LEB	Romans	8	8	and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God .
LEB	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death .
LEB	Romans	8	3	For what was impossible for the law , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did . By [ a ] sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ,
LEB	Romans	8	4	in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us , who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
LEB	Romans	8	5	For those who are living according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh , but those who are living according to the Spirit are intent on the things of the Spirit .
LEB	Romans	8	6	For the mindset of the flesh is death , but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace ,
LEB	Romans	8	7	because the mindset of the flesh is enmity toward God , for it is not subjected to the law of God , for it is not able to do so ,
LEB	Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you . But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , this person does not belong to him [ b ] .
LEB	Romans	8	10	But if Christ is in you , the body is dead because of sin , but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
LEB	Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you , the one who raised Christ Jesus [ c ] from the dead will also make alive your mortal bodies through his Spirit who lives in you .
LEB	Romans	8	12	So then , brothers , we are obligated not to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
LEB	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh , you are going to die , but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
LEB	Romans	8	14	For all those who are led by the Spirit of God , these are sons of God .
LEB	Romans	8	15	For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again , but you have received the Spirit of adoption , by whom we cry out , “ Abba ! [ d ] Father ! ”
LEB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself confirms to our spirit that we are children of God ,
LEB	Romans	8	17	and if children , also heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ , if indeed we suffer together with him so that we may also be glorified together with him . The Glory that is to be Revealed
LEB	Romans	8	18	For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us .
LEB	Romans	8	19	For the eagerly expecting creation awaits eagerly the revelation of the sons of God .
LEB	Romans	8	20	For the creation has been subjected to futility , not willingly , but because of the one who subjected it , in hope
LEB	Romans	8	21	that the creation itself also will be set free from its servility to decay , into the glorious freedom of the children of God .
LEB	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers agony together until now .
LEB	Romans	8	23	Not only this , but we ourselves also , having the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves while we [ e ] await eagerly our adoption , the redemption of our body .
LEB	Romans	8	24	For in hope we were saved , but hope that is seen is not hope , for who hopes for what he sees ?
LEB	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see , we await it eagerly with patient endurance .
LEB	Romans	8	26	And likewise also , the Spirit helps us in our weakness , for we do not know how to pray as one ought , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with unexpressed groanings .
LEB	Romans	8	27	And the one who searches our hearts knows what the mindset of the Spirit is , because he intercedes on behalf of the saints according to the will of God .
LEB	Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , for those who are called according to his purpose ,
LEB	Romans	8	29	because those whom he foreknew , he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , so that he should be the firstborn among many brothers .
LEB	Romans	8	30	And those whom he predestined , these he also called , and those whom he called , these he also justified , and those whom he justified , these he also glorified . Victory in Christ
LEB	Romans	8	31	What then shall we say about these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
LEB	Romans	8	32	Indeed , he who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all , how will he not also , together with him , freely give us all things ?
LEB	Romans	8	33	Who will bring charges against God ’ s elect ? God is the one who justifies .
LEB	Romans	8	34	Who is the one who condemns ? Christ [ f ] is the one who died , and more than that , who was raised , who is also at the right hand of God , who also intercedes for us .
LEB	Romans	8	35	Who will separate us from the love of Christ ? Will affliction or distress or persecution or hunger or lack of sufficient clothing or danger or the sword ?
LEB	Romans	8	36	Just as it is written , “ On account of you we are being put to death the whole day long ; we are considered as sheep for slaughter. ” [ g ]
LEB	Romans	8	37	No , but in all these things we prevail completely through the one who loved us .
LEB	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor rulers , nor things present , nor things to come , nor powers ,
LEB	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .

LEB	Romans	9	9	For the statement of the promise is this : “ At this time I will return and Sarah will have [ d ] a son. ” [ e ]
LEB	Romans	9	2	that my grief is great and there is constant distress in my heart .
LEB	Romans	9	3	For I could wish myself to be accursed from Christ for the sake of my brothers , my fellow countrymen according to the flesh ,
LEB	Romans	9	4	who are Israelites , to whom belong the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the temple service , and the promises ,
LEB	Romans	9	5	to whom belong the patriarchs , and from whom is the Christ according to human descent , who is God over all , blessed forever [ a ] ! Amen .
LEB	Romans	9	6	But it is not as if the word of God had failed . For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel ,
LEB	Romans	9	7	nor are they all children because they are descendants of Abraham , but “ In Isaac will your descendants be named. ” [ b ]
LEB	Romans	9	8	That is , it is not the children by human descent [ c ] who are children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as descendants .
LEB	Romans	9	10	And not only this , but also when [ f ] Rebecca conceived children by one man , [ g ] Isaac our father—
LEB	Romans	9	11	for although they [ h ] had not yet been born , or done anything good or evil , in order that the purpose of God according to election might remain ,
LEB	Romans	9	12	not by works but by the one who calls—it was said to her , “ The older will serve the younger , ” [ i ]

LEB	Romans	9	15	For to Moses he says , “ I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion. ” [ l ]
LEB	Romans	9	16	Consequently therefore , it does not depend on the [ m ] one who wills or on the one who runs , but on God who shows mercy .
LEB	Romans	9	17	For the scripture says to Pharaoh , “ For this very reason I have raised you up , so that I may demonstrate my power in you , and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. ” [ n ]
LEB	Romans	9	18	Consequently therefore , he has mercy on whomever he wishes , and he hardens whomever he wishes .
LEB	Romans	9	19	Therefore you will say to me , “ Why then does he still find fault ? For who has resisted [ o ] his will ?
LEB	Romans	9	20	On the contrary , O man , who are you who answers back to God ? Will what is molded say to the one who molded it , “ Why did you make me like this ” ? [ p ]

LEB	Romans	9	23	And he did so [ s ] in order that he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory ,
LEB	Romans	9	24	us whom he also called , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles ?
LEB	Romans	9	25	As he also says in Hosea , “ I will call those who were not my people , ‘ My people , ’ and those who were not loved , ‘ Loved. ’ [ t ]
LEB	Romans	9	26	And it will be in the place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they will be called ‘ sons of the living God. ’ ” [ u ]

LEB	Romans	9	29	And just as Isaiah foretold , “ If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants , we would have become like Sodom and would have resembled Gomorrah. ” [ x ]
LEB	Romans	9	30	What then shall we say ? That the Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , attained righteousness—even the righteousness that is by faith .
LEB	Romans	9	31	But Israel , pursuing the law of righteousness , did not attain to the law .
LEB	Romans	9	32	Why that ? Because they did not pursue it by faith , but as if by works . They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble [ y ] ,

LEB	Romans	10	10	For with the heart one believes , resulting in righteousness , and with the mouth one confesses , resulting in salvation .
LEB	Romans	10	2	For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God , but not according to knowledge .
LEB	Romans	10	3	For ignoring the righteousness of God , and seeking to establish their own , [ a ] they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
LEB	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes .
LEB	Romans	10	5	For Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law : “ The person who does this [ b ] will live by it. ” [ c ] [ d ]
LEB	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness from faith speaks like this : “ Do not say in your heart , [ e ] ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ” [ f ] ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ,
LEB	Romans	10	7	or “ Who will descend into the abyss ? ” [ g ] ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
LEB	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ The word is near to you , in your mouth and in your heart ” [ h ] ( that is , the word of faith that we proclaim ) ,
LEB	Romans	10	9	that [ i ] if you confess with your mouth “ Jesus is Lord ” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
LEB	Romans	10	11	For the scripture says , “ Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. ” [ j ]
LEB	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek , for the same Lord is Lord of all , who is rich to all who call upon him .
LEB	Romans	10	13	For “ everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved. ” [ k ]
LEB	Romans	10	14	How then will they call upon him in whom they have not believed ? And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard ? And how will they hear about him without one who preaches to them ?
LEB	Romans	10	15	And how will they preach , unless they are sent ? Just as it is written , “ How timely are the feet of those who bring good news of good things. ” [ l ]
LEB	Romans	10	16	But not all have obeyed the good news , for Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our report ? ” [ m ]

LEB	Romans	11	11	I say then , they did not stumble so that they fell , did they ? [ j ] May it never be ! But by their trespass , salvation has come to the Gentiles , in order to provoke them to jealousy . [ k ]
LEB	Romans	11	2	God has not rejected his people , whom he foreknew ! Or do you not know , in the passage about [ b ] Elijah , what the scripture says—how he appeals to God against Israel ?
LEB	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have torn down your altars , and I alone am left , and they are seeking my life ! ” [ c ]
LEB	Romans	11	4	But what does the divine response say to him ? “ I have left for myself seven thousand people [ d ] who have not bent the knee to Baal. ” [ e ]
LEB	Romans	11	5	So in this way also at the present time , there is a remnant selected by grace [ f ] .
LEB	Romans	11	6	But if by grace , it is no longer by works , for otherwise grace would no longer be grace .
LEB	Romans	11	7	What then ? What Israel was searching for , this it did not obtain . But the elect obtained it , and the rest were hardened ,
LEB	Romans	11	8	just as it is written , “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear , until this very day. ” [ g ]
LEB	Romans	11	9	And David says , “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , and a cause for stumbling and a retribution to them ;
LEB	Romans	11	10	let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see , and cause their backs to bend continually [ h ] . ” [ i ]
LEB	Romans	11	12	And if their trespass means riches for the world and their loss means riches for the Gentiles , how much more will their fullness mean ? Gentile Branches Grafted in
LEB	Romans	11	13	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . Therefore , inasmuch as I am apostle to the Gentiles , I promote my ministry ,
LEB	Romans	11	14	- Romans 11:4 Or perhaps “ males , ” referring to men only - Romans 11:4 A quotation from
LEB	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance mean except life from the dead ?
LEB	Romans	11	16	Now if the first fruits are holy , so also is the whole batch of dough , and if the root is holy , so also are the branches .
LEB	Romans	11	17	Now if some of the branches were broken off , and you , although you [ l ] were a wild olive tree , were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the root of the olive tree ’ s richness ,
LEB	Romans	11	18	do not boast against the branches . But if you boast against them , you do not support the root , but the root supports you .
LEB	Romans	11	19	Then you will say , “ Branches were broken off in order that I could be grafted in. ”
LEB	Romans	11	20	Well said ! They were broken off because of unbelief , but you stand firm because of faith . Do not think arrogant thoughts , but be afraid .
LEB	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural [ m ] branches , neither will he spare you . [ n ]
LEB	Romans	11	22	See , then , the kindness and severity of God : severity upon those who have fallen , but upon you the kindness of God—if you continue in his kindness , for otherwise you also will be cut off .
LEB	Romans	11	23	And those also , if they do not persist in unbelief , will be grafted in , because God is able to graft them in again .
LEB	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much more will these who are natural branches [ o ] be grafted into their own olive tree ? All Israel to be Saved
LEB	Romans	11	25	For I do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , of this mystery , so that you will not be wise in your own sight , [ p ] that a partial hardening has happened to Israel , until the full number of the Gentiles has come in ,
LEB	Romans	11	26	and so all Israel will be saved , just as it is written , “ The deliverer will come out of Zion ; he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob .
LEB	Romans	11	27	And this is the covenant from me with them [ q ] when I take away their sins. ” [ r ]
LEB	Romans	11	28	With respect to the gospel , they are enemies for your sake , but with respect to election , they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers .
LEB	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable .
LEB	Romans	11	30	For just as you formerly were disobedient to God , but now have been shown mercy because of the disobedience of these ,
LEB	Romans	11	31	so also these have now been disobedient for your mercy , in order that they also may now be shown mercy .
LEB	Romans	11	32	For God confined them all in disobedience , in order that he could have mercy on them all .
LEB	Romans	11	33	Oh , the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God ! How unsearchable are his judgments and how incomprehensible are his ways !
LEB	Romans	11	34	“ For who has known the mind of the Lord , or who has been his counselor ? [ s ]
LEB	Romans	11	35	Or who has given in advance to him , and it will be paid back to him ? ” [ t ]
LEB	Romans	11	36	For from him and through him and to him are all things . To him be glory for eternity ! Amen .

LEB	Romans	12	2	And do not be conformed to this age , but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , so that you may approve what is the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God . A Variety of Gifts in the Body of Christ
LEB	Romans	12	3	For by the grace given to me I say to everyone who is among you not to think more highly of yourself than what one ought to think , but to think sensibly [ a ] , as God has apportioned a measure of faith to each one .
LEB	Romans	12	4	For just as in one body we have many members , but all the members do not have the same function ,
LEB	Romans	12	5	in the same way we who are many are one body in Christ , and individually [ b ] members of one another ,
LEB	Romans	12	6	but having different gifts according to the grace given to us : if it is prophecy , according to the proportion of his faith ;
LEB	Romans	12	7	if it is service , by service ; if it is one who teaches , by teaching ;
LEB	Romans	12	8	if it is one who exhorts , by exhortation ; one who gives , with sincerity ; one who leads , with diligence ; one who shows mercy , with cheerfulness . Living in Love
LEB	Romans	12	9	Love must be without hypocrisy . Abhor what is evil ; be attached to what is good ,
LEB	Romans	12	10	being devoted to one another in brotherly love , esteeming one another more highly in honor ,
LEB	Romans	12	11	not lagging in diligence , being enthusiastic in spirit , serving the Lord ,
LEB	Romans	12	13	contributing to the needs of the saints , pursuing hospitality .
LEB	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute , [ c ] bless and do not curse them .
LEB	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice ; weep with those who weep .
LEB	Romans	12	16	Think the same thing toward one another ; do not think arrogantly [ d ] , but associate with the lowly . Do not be wise in your own sight [ e ] .
LEB	Romans	12	17	Pay back no one evil for evil . Take thought for what is good in the sight of all people .
LEB	Romans	12	18	If it is possible on your part , be at peace with all people .
LEB	Romans	12	19	Do not take revenge yourselves , dear friends , but give place to God ’ s wrath , for it is written , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , ” [ f ] says the Lord .

LEB	Romans	13	13	Let us live decently , as in the day , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and licentiousness , not in strife and jealousy .
LEB	Romans	13	2	So then , the one who resists authority resists the ordinance which is from God , and those who resist will receive condemnation on themselves .
LEB	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a cause of terror for a good deed , but for bad conduct . So do you want not to be afraid of authority ? Do what is good , and you will have praise from it ,
LEB	Romans	13	4	for it is God ’ s servant to you for what is good . But if you do what is bad , be afraid , because it does not bear the sword to no purpose . For it is God ’ s servant , the one who avenges for punishment on the one who does what is bad .
LEB	Romans	13	5	Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection , not only because of wrath but also because of conscience .
LEB	Romans	13	6	For because of this you also pay taxes , for the authorities [ a ] are servants of God , busily engaged in this very thing .
LEB	Romans	13	7	Pay to everyone what is owed : pay taxes to whom taxes are due ; pay customs duties to whom customs duties are due ; pay respect to whom respect is due ; pay honor to whom honor is due . [ b ] Love Fulfills the Law
LEB	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone , except to love one another , for the one who loves someone else has fulfilled the law .
LEB	Romans	13	9	For the commandments , “ You shall not commit adultery , you shall not commit murder , you shall not steal , you shall not covet , ” [ c ] and if there is any other commandment , are summed up in this statement : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ” [ d ]
LEB	Romans	13	10	Love does not commit evil against a neighbor . Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
LEB	Romans	13	11	And do this because you [ e ] know the time , that it is already the hour for you to wake up from sleep . For our salvation is nearer now than when we believed .
LEB	Romans	13	12	The night is far gone , and the day has drawn near . Therefore let us throw off [ f ] the deeds of darkness and put on the weapons of light .
LEB	Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh .

LEB	Romans	14	14	I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself , except to the one who considers something to be unclean ; to that person it is unclean .
LEB	Romans	14	2	One believes he may eat all things , but the one who is weak eats only vegetables .
LEB	Romans	14	3	The one who eats must not despise the one who does not eat , and the one who does not eat must not judge the one who eats , because God has accepted him .
LEB	Romans	14	4	Who are you , who passes judgment on the domestic slave belonging to someone else ? To his own master he stands or falls , and he will stand , for the Lord is able to make him stand .
LEB	Romans	14	5	One person [ a ] prefers one day over another day , and another person regards every day alike . Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind .
LEB	Romans	14	6	The one who is intent on the day is intent on it for the Lord , and the one who eats eats for the Lord , because he is thankful to God , and the one who does not eat does not eat for the Lord , and he is thankful to God .
LEB	Romans	14	7	For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself .
LEB	Romans	14	8	For if we live , we live for the Lord , and if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore whether we live or whether we die , we are the Lord ’ s .
LEB	Romans	14	9	For Christ died and became alive again for this reason , in order that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
LEB	Romans	14	10	But why do you judge your brother ? Or also , why do you despise your brother ? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God .
LEB	Romans	14	11	For it is written , “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee will bow to me , and every tongue will praise God. ” [ b ]
LEB	Romans	14	12	So [ c ] each one of us will give an account concerning himself . [ d ]
LEB	Romans	14	13	Therefore , let us no longer pass judgment on one another , but rather decide this : not to place a cause for stumbling or a temptation before a brother .
LEB	Romans	14	15	For if because of food , your brother is grieved , you are no longer living according to love . Do not destroy by your food that person for whom Christ died .
LEB	Romans	14	16	Therefore do not let your good be slandered .
LEB	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking , but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit .
LEB	Romans	14	18	For the one who serves Christ in this way is well-pleasing to God and approved by people .
LEB	Romans	14	19	So then , let us pursue what promotes peace [ e ] and what edifies one another [ f ] .
LEB	Romans	14	20	Do not destroy the work of God on account of food . All things are clean , but it is wrong for the person who eats and stumbles in the process [ g ] .
LEB	Romans	14	21	It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weakened . [ h ]
LEB	Romans	14	22	The faith that you have , have with respect to yourself before God . Blessed is the one who does not pass judgment on himself by what he approves .
LEB	Romans	14	23	But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats , because he does not do so from faith , and everything that is not from faith is sin .

LEB	Romans	15	15	But I have written to you more boldly on some points , so as to remind you again because of the grace that has been given to me by God ,
LEB	Romans	15	2	Let each one of us please his neighbor for his good , for the purpose of edification .
LEB	Romans	15	3	For even Christ did not please himself , but just as it is written , “ The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me. ” [ a ]
LEB	Romans	15	4	For whatever was written beforehand was written for our instruction , in order that through patient endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope .
LEB	Romans	15	5	Now may the God of patient endurance and of encouragement grant you to be in agreement [ b ] with one another , in accordance with Christ Jesus ,
LEB	Romans	15	6	so that with one mind you may glorify with one mouth the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
LEB	Romans	15	7	Therefore accept one another , just as Christ also has accepted you , to the glory of God .
LEB	Romans	15	8	For I say , Christ has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God , in order to confirm the promises to the fathers ,
LEB	Romans	15	9	and that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy , just as it is written , “ Because of this , I will praise you among the Gentiles , and I will sing praise to your name. ” [ c ]
LEB	Romans	15	10	And again it says , “ Rejoice , Gentiles , with his people. ” [ d ]
LEB	Romans	15	11	And again , “ Praise the Lord , all the Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise him. ” [ e ]
LEB	Romans	15	12	And again Isaiah says , “ The root of Jesse will come , even the one who rises to rule over the Gentiles ; in him the Gentiles will put their hope. ” [ f ]
LEB	Romans	15	13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit . Paul ’ s Ministry to the Gentiles
LEB	Romans	15	14	Now I myself also am convinced about you , my brothers , that you yourselves also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to instruct one another .
LEB	Romans	15	16	with the result that I am a servant of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles , serving the gospel of God as a priest , in order that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
LEB	Romans	15	17	Therefore I have a reason for boasting in Christ Jesus regarding the things concerning God .
LEB	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak about anything except that which Christ has accomplished through me , resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed ,
LEB	Romans	15	19	by the power of signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit , [ g ] so that from Jerusalem and traveling around as far as Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ .
LEB	Romans	15	20	And so , having as my ambition to proclaim the gospel where Christ has not been named , in order that I will not build on the foundation belonging to someone else ,
LEB	Romans	15	21	but just as it is written , “ Those to whom it was not announced concerning him will see , and those who have not heard will understand. ” [ h ] Paul ’ s Travel Plans
LEB	Romans	15	22	For this reason also I was hindered many times from coming to you ,
LEB	Romans	15	23	and now , no longer having a place in these regions , but having a desire for many years to come to you
LEB	Romans	15	24	whenever I travel to Spain . For I hope while I [ i ] am passing through to see you and to be sent on my way by you , whenever I have first enjoyed your company for a while .
LEB	Romans	15	25	But now I am traveling to Jerusalem , serving the saints .
LEB	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem .
LEB	Romans	15	27	For they were pleased to do so , and they are obligated to them . For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things , they ought also to serve them in material things .
LEB	Romans	15	28	Therefore , after I [ j ] have accomplished this and sealed this fruit for delivery to them , I will depart by way of you for Spain ,
LEB	Romans	15	29	and I know that when I [ k ] come to you , I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ .
LEB	Romans	15	30	Now I exhort you , brothers , through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit , to contend along with me in your prayers on my behalf to God ,
LEB	Romans	15	31	that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea , and my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints ,
LEB	Romans	15	32	so that , coming to you with joy by the will of God , I may rest with you .
LEB	Romans	15	33	Now may the God of peace be with all of you . Amen .

LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving for the Corinthian Believers
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I give thanks to my God always concerning you , because of the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	5	that [ c ] in everything you were made rich in him , in all speech and all knowledge ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	6	just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	7	so that you do not lack in any spiritual gift as you [ d ] eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	8	who will also confirm you until the end , blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , by whom you were called to fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord . Divisions in the Church at Corinth
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I exhort you , brothers , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you all say the same thing and there not be divisions among you , and that you be made complete in the same mind and with the same purpose .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it has been made clear to me concerning you , my brothers , by Chloe ’ s people [ e ] , that there are quarrels among you .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	12	But I say this , that each of you is saying , “ I am with Paul , ” and “ I am with Apollos , ” and “ I am with Cephas , ” and “ I am with Christ. ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Has Christ been divided ? Paul was not crucified for you , was he ? [ f ] Or were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I give thanks [ g ] that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	15	lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	16	( Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas . Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else . )
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to proclaim the gospel , not with clever speech [ h ] , lest the cross of Christ be emptied . Christ Crucified , the Power and Wisdom of God
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound. ” [ i ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise person ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the debater of this age ? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For since , in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom did not know God , God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For indeed , Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	23	but we preach Christ crucified , to the Jews a cause for stumbling , but to the Gentiles foolishness ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	24	but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	25	For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , [ j ] and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength . [ k ] Boast in the Lord
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For consider your calling , brothers , that not many were wise according to human standards , [ l ] not many were powerful , not many were well born .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise , and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	28	and the insignificant of the world , and the despised , God chose , the things that are not , in order that he might abolish the things that are ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	29	so that all flesh may not boast before God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But from him you are in Christ Jesus , who became wisdom to us from God , and righteousness and sanctification and redemption ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	1	31	so that , just as it is written , “ The one who boasts , let him boast in the Lord. ” [ m ] Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians 2:16 A quotation from Isa 40:13
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	4	and my speech and my preaching were not with the persuasiveness [ c ] of wisdom , but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	5	in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God . The Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Now we do speak wisdom among the mature , but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are perishing ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	7	but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery , which God predestined before the ages for our glory ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	8	which none of the rulers of this age knew . For if they had known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But just as it is written , “ Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard , and have not entered into the heart of man , all that [ d ] God has prepared for those who love him. ” [ e ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	10	For [ f ] to us God has revealed them through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man that is in him ? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	13	things which we also speak , not in words taught by human wisdom , but in words taught by the Spirit , explaining spiritual things to spiritual people . [ g ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God , for they are foolishness to him , and he is not able to understand them , because they are spiritually discerned .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	15	Now the spiritual person discerns all things , but he himself is judged by no one .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	2	16	“ For who has known the mind of the Lord ; who has advised him ? ” [ h ] But we have the mind of Christ . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians 3:20 A quotation from Ps 94:11
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for you are still fleshly . For where there is jealousy and strife among you , are you not fleshly , and do you not live like unregenerate people ? [ a ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I gave you milk to drink , not solid food , for you were not yet able to eat it . But now you are still not able ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For whenever anyone says , “ I am with Paul , ” and another , “ I am with Apollos , ” are you not merely human ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Therefore , what is Apollos and what is Paul ? Servants through whom you believed , and to each as the Lord gave .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted , Apollos watered , but God was causing it to grow .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then , neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but God who is causing it to grow .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one , but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s fellow workers ; you are God ’ s field , God ’ s building .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God given to me , like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation , and another is building upon it . But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon it .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if anyone builds upon the foundation with gold , silver , precious stones , wood , grass , straw ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	13	the work of each one will become evident . For the day will reveal it , because it will be revealed with fire , and the fire itself will test the work of each one , of what sort it is .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If anyone ’ s work that he has built upon it remains , he will receive a reward .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If anyone ’ s work is burned up , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , but so as through fire .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Do you not know that you are God ’ s temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy this one . For God ’ s temple is holy , which you are .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one deceive himself . If anyone thinks himself to be wise among you in this age , let him become a fool , in order that he may become wise .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God , for it is written , “ The one who catches the wise in their craftiness , ” [ b ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are futile. ” [ c ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	21	So then , let no one boast in people . For all things are yours ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come , all things are yours ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	3	23	and you are Christ ’ s , and Christ is God ’ s . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians 4:13 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ slandered ” ) which is understood as temporal
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I am conscious of nothing against myself , but not by this am I vindicated . But the one who judges me is the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	2	In this case , moreover , it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court , [ a ] but I do not even judge myself .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore do not judge anything before the time , until the Lord should come , who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts , and then praise will come to each one from God . The Apostles ’ Humility
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	6	Now I have applied these things , brothers , to myself and Apollos for your sake , in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written , lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who concedes you superiority ? And what do you have that you did not receive ? But if indeed you received it , why do you boast as if you [ b ] did not receive it ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Already you are satiated ! Already you are rich ! Apart from us you reign as kings ! And would that indeed you reigned as kings , in order that we also might reign as kings with you !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For , I think , God has exhibited us apostles last of all , as condemned to death , because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for the sake of Christ , but you are prudent in Christ ! We are weak , but you are strong ! You are honored , but we are dishonored !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	12	and we toil , working with our own hands . When we are [ c ] reviled , we bless ; when we are [ d ] persecuted , we endure ;
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	13	when we are [ e ] slandered , we encourage . We have become like the refuse of the world , the offscouring of all things , until now . Paul ’ s Concern for the Corinthian Believers
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I am not writing these things to shame you , but admonishing you as my dear children .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ , yet you do not have many fathers , for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore I exhort you , become imitators of me .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	17	Because of this , I have sent to you Timothy , who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus , just as I teach everywhere in every church .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	18	But some have become arrogant , as if I were not coming to you .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I am coming to you soon , if the Lord wills , and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant , but the power .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not with talk , but with power .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What do you want ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or with love and a spirit of gentleness ? Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	5	I have decided [ d ] to hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And you are inflated with pride , and should you not rather have mourned , so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	3	-
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus , when [ c ] you are assembled , and my spirit , together with the power of our Lord Jesus ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your boasting is not good . Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough , just as you are unleavened . For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	8	So then , let us celebrate the feast , not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	10	By no means did I mean the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters , since then you would have to depart out of the world .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother , if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler—with such a person not even to eat .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what is it to me to judge those outside ? Should you not judge those inside ?

LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians 6:16 A quotation from Gen 2:24
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But brother goes to court with brother , and this before unbelievers !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world ? And if by you the world is judged , are you unworthy of the most insignificant courts ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Do you not know that we will judge angels , not to mention ordinary matters ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	4	Therefore , if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters , do you seat [ b ] these despised people in the church ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I say this to your shame . So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	8	But you wrong and defraud , and do this to brothers !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived ! Neither sexually immoral people , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor passive homosexual partners , nor dominant homosexual partners ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	10	nor thieves , nor greedy persons , not drunkards , not abusive persons , not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And some of you were these things , but you were washed , but you were sanctified , but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus [ c ] and by the Spirit of our God . Avoid Sexual Immorality
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	12	All things are permitted for me , but not all things are profitable . All things are permitted for me , but I will not be controlled by anything .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Food is for the stomach , and the stomach for food , but God will abolish both of them [ d ] . Now the body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Therefore , shall I take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	16	Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her ? For it says , “ The two will become one flesh. ” [ e ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with him .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Flee sexual immorality . Every sin that a person commits is outside his body , but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	6	19	Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you , whom you have from God , and you are not your own ?

LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians 7:39 Literally “ falls asleep ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	7	I wish all people could be like myself , but each one has his own gift from God , one in this way and another in that way .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	2	But because of sexual immorality , let each man have [ b ] his own wife and let each woman have her own husband .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife , and likewise also the wife to her husband .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife does not have authority over her own body , but her husband does . And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body , but his wife does .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not defraud one another , except perhaps by agreement , for a time , in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer , and then you should be together [ c ] again , lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self control .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I say this as a concession , not as a command .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	8	Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows : It is good for them if they remain as I am .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not control themselves , they should marry , for it is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	10	To the married I command—not I , but the Lord—a wife must not separate from her husband .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But if indeed she does separate , she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband . And a husband must not divorce his wife .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	12	Now to the rest I say—not the Lord—if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him , he must not divorce her .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her , she must not divorce her husband .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother , since otherwise your children are unclean , but now they are holy .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbeliever leaves , let him leave . The brother or the sister is not bound in such cases . But God has called us [ d ] in peace .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But to each one as the Lord has apportioned . As God has called each one , thus let him live—and thus I order in all the churches .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was anyone called after [ e ] being circumcised ? He must not undo his circumcision . Was anyone called in uncircumcision ? He must not become circumcised .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Each one in the calling in which he was called—in this he should remain .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you called while a slave ? Do not let it be a concern to you . But if indeed you are able to become free , rather make use of it .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For the one who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord ’ s freedperson . Likewise the one who is called while free is a slave of Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were bought at a price ; do not become slaves of men .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Each one in the situation in which he was called , brothers—in this he should remain with God . Concerning the Unmarried
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord , but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	26	Therefore , I consider this to be good because of the impending distress , that it is good for a man to be thus .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek release . Are you free from a wife ? Do not seek a wife .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But if you marry , you have not sinned , and if the virgin marries , she has not sinned . But such people will have affliction in the flesh , and I would spare you .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But I say this , brothers : the time is shortened , that from now on even those who have wives should be as if they do not have wives ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who weep as if they do not weep , and those who rejoice as if they do not rejoice , and those who buy as if they do not possess ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who make use of the world as if they do not make full use of it . For the present form of this world is passing away .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I want you to be free from care . The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But the one who is married cares for the things of the world , how he may please his wife ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and he is divided . And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord , in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . But the married woman cares for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	35	Now I am saying this for your own benefit , not that I may put a restriction on you , but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin , if she is past her prime [ f ] and it ought to be thus , let him do what he wishes . He does not sin . Let them marry .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	37	But he who stands firm in his heart , not having necessity , but has authority concerning his own will , and has decided this in his own heart , to keep his own virgin , he will do well .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then , the one who marries [ g ] his own virgin does well , and the one who does not marry her will do better .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound for as long a time as her husband lives . But if her husband dies [ h ] , she is free to marry whomever she wishes , only in the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she remains thus , according to my opinion—and I think I have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians 8:13 Literally “ for the age ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But food does not bring us close to God . For neither if we eat do we have more , nor if we do not eat do we lack . [ d ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	2	If anyone thinks he knows anything , he has not yet known as it is necessary to know .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if anyone loves God , this one is known by him .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Therefore , concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols , we know that “ an idol is nothing in the world ” and that “ there is no God except one. ” [ b ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For even if after all there are so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth , just as there are many gods and many lords ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	6	yet to us there is one God , the Father , from whom are all things , and we are for him , and there is one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we are through him .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But this knowledge is not in everyone . But some , being accustomed until now to the idol , eat this food as food sacrificed to idols , and their conscience , because it [ c ] is weak , is defiled .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol ’ s temple , will not his conscience , because it [ e ] is weak , be strengthened so that he eats the food sacrificed to idols ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	11	For the one who is weak—the brother for whom Christ died—is destroyed by your knowledge .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	12	Now if you [ f ] sin in this way against the brothers and wound their conscience , which is weak , you sin against Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Therefore , if food causes my brother to sin , I will never eat meat forever [ g ] , in order that I may not cause my brother to sin . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For in the law of Moses it is written , “ You must not muzzle an ox while it [ d ] is threshing. ” [ e ] It is not about oxen God is concerned , is it ? [ f ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If to others I am not an apostle , yet indeed I am to you , for you are my seal of apostleship in the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	3	My defense to those who examine me is this :
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Do we not have the right to take along a sister as wife , like the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right to refrain from working [ a ] ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who ever serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it ? Who [ b ] shepherds a flock and does not drink [ c ] from the milk of the flock ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I am not saying these things according to a human perspective . Or does the law not also say these things ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or doubtless does he speak for our sake [ g ] ? For it is written for our sake [ h ] , because the one who plows ought to plow in hope and the one who threshes ought to do so in hope of a share .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown spiritual things among you , is it too great a thing if we reap material things from you ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others share this right over you , do we not do so even more ? Yet we have not made use of this right , but we endure all things , in order that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do you not know that those performing the holy services eat the things from the temple , and those attending to the altar have a share with the altar ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way also the Lord ordered those who proclaim the gospel to live from the gospel .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have not made use of any of these rights . And I am not writing these things in order that it may be thus with me . For it would be better to me rather to die than for anyone to deprive me of my reason for boasting .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For if I proclaim the gospel , it is not to me a reason for boasting , for necessity is imposed on me . For woe is to me if I do not proclaim the gospel .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this voluntarily , I have a reward , but if I do so unwillingly , I have been entrusted with a stewardship .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward ? That when I [ i ] proclaim the gospel , I may offer the gospel free of charge , in order not to make full use of my right in the gospel .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For although I [ j ] am free from all people , I have enslaved myself to all , in order that I may gain more .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	20	I have become like a Jew to the Jews , in order that I may gain the Jews . To those under the law I became as under the law ( although I [ k ] myself am not under the law ) in order that I may gain those under the law .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those outside the law I became as outside the law ( although I [ l ] am not outside the law of God , but subject to the law of Christ ) in order that I may gain those outside the law .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak I became weak , in order that I may gain the weak . I have become all things to all people , in order that by all means I may save some .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this for the sake of the gospel , in order that I may become a participant with it .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Do you not know that those who run in the stadium all run , but one receives the prize ? Run in such a way that you may win .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things . Thus those do so in order that they may receive a perishable crown , but we an imperishable one .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	26	Therefore I run in this way , not as running aimlessly ; I box in this way , not as beating the air .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I discipline my body and subjugate it , lest somehow after [ m ] preaching to others , I myself should become disqualified . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians 10:32 Literally “ be blameless ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	10	nor grumble , just as some of them grumbled , and were destroyed by the destroyer .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	2	and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	3	and all ate the same spiritual food ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	4	and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But God was not pleased with the majority of them , for they were struck down in the desert .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things happened as examples for us , so that we should not be desirers of evil things , just as those also desired them ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	7	and not become idolaters , as some of them did , just as it is written , “ The people sat down to eat and drink , and stood up to play , ” [ a ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	8	nor commit sexual immorality , as some of them committed sexual immorality , and twenty-three thousand fell in one day ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	9	nor put Christ to the test , as some of them tested him , and were destroyed by snakes ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now these things happened to those people as an example , but are written for our instruction , on whom the ends of the ages have come .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Therefore , the one who thinks that he stands must watch out lest he fall .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	13	Temptation has not come upon you except what is common to humanity . But God is faithful , who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able , but will also make a way out together with the temptation , so that you may be able to endure it . Warning Against Idolatry
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Therefore , my dear friends , flee from idolatry .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I am speaking as to sensible people ; you judge what I am saying .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not a participation in the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not a participation in the body of Christ ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	17	Because there is one bread , we who are many are one body , for we all share from the one bread .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Consider Israel according to the flesh : are not the ones who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	19	Therefore , what am I saying ? That food sacrificed to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	20	No , but that the things which they sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons and not to God , and I do not want you to become sharers with demons .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	21	You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You are not able to share the table of the Lord and the table of demons .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Or are we attempting to provoke the Lord to jealousy ? We are not stronger than he is , are we ? [ b ] Freedom in Christ
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are permitted , but not all things are profitable . All things are permitted , but not all things build up .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no one seek his own good [ c ] but the good of the other .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Eat everything that is sold in the meat market , asking no questions [ d ] for the sake of the conscience ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	26	for “ the earth is the Lord ’ s , and its fullness. ” [ e ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If any of the unbelievers invites you , and you want to go , eat everything that is set before you , asking no questions [ f ] for the sake of the conscience .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if someone says to you , “ This is offered to idols , ” do not eat it , for the sake of that one who informed you and the conscience .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	29	Now I am not speaking about your own conscience , but the conscience of the other person . For why is my freedom judged by another ’ s conscience ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	30	If I partake with thankfulness , why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Therefore , whether you eat or you drink or whatever you do , do all things for the glory of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Give no offense [ g ] both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	10	33	just as I also please all people in all things , not seeking my own benefit , but the benefit of the many , in order that they may be saved . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians 11:33 * Here the direct object ( “ the Lord ’ s supper ” ) is supplied from context in the English translation
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless , neither is woman anything apart from man , nor is man anything apart from woman in the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you that you remember me in all things , and just as I handed over to you the traditions , you hold fast to them .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man , and the man is the head of the woman , and the head of Christ is God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man who prays or prophesies while [ a ] having something [ b ] on his head dishonors his head ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	5	but every woman who prays or prophesies with uncovered head dishonors her head , for she is one and the same with the one whose head is shaved .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if a woman does not cover herself , let her hair be shorn off . But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head [ c ] shorn or shaved , let her cover her head . [ d ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For indeed a man ought not to cover his head , because he [ e ] is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For man is not from woman , but woman from man .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	9	For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman , but woman for the sake of the man .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	10	Because of this , the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head , on account of the angels .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For just as the woman is from the man , thus also the man is through the woman . But all things are from God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	13	You judge for yourselves [ f ] : is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head [ g ] uncovered ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	14	And does not nature itself teach you that a man , if he wears long hair , it is a dishonor to him ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But a woman , if she wears long hair , it is her glory , because her hair is given [ h ] for a covering .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if anyone is disposed to be contentious , we have no such custom , nor do the churches of God . Improper Conduct at the Lord ’ s Supper
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	17	But in giving this instruction I do not praise you , because you come together not for the better but for the worse .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For in the first place , when you [ i ] come together as a church , I hear there are divisions among you , and in part I believe it .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you , in order that those who are approved may become evident among you .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	20	Therefore , when [ j ] you come together in the same place , it is not to eat the Lord ’ s supper .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For when you [ k ] eat it , each one of you goes ahead to take his own supper , and one is hungry and another is drunk .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	22	For do you not have houses for eating and drinking ? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? In this I will not praise you !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you , that the Lord Jesus , on the night in which he was betrayed , took bread ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and after he [ l ] had given thanks , he broke it and said , “ This is my body which is for you . Do this in remembrance of me. ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	25	Likewise also the cup , after they had eaten , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of me. ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord ’ s death until he comes .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	27	So then , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a person examine himself , and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For the one who eats and drinks , if he [ m ] does not recognize the body , eats and drinks judgment against himself .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	30	Because of this , many are weak and sick among you , and quite a few have died [ n ] .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	31	But if we were evaluating ourselves , we would not be judged .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But if we [ o ] are judged by the Lord , we are being disciplined , in order that we will not be condemned with the world .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	33	So then , my brothers , when you [ p ] come together in order to eat the Lord ’ s supper , [ q ] wait for one another .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	11	34	If anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest you come together for judgment . And I will give directions about the remaining matters whenever I come . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians 12:31 Or “ you are striving ” ( some understand the form of this verb to be indicative mood rather than imperative mood )
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For just as the body is one and has many members , but all the members of the body , although they [ h ] are many , are one body , thus also Christ .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	2	You know that when you were pagans , you were led astray to the speechless idols , however you were led .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says , “ Jesus is accursed , ” and no one is able to say “ Jesus is Lord ” except by the Holy Spirit .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are varieties of gifts , but the same Spirit ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	5	and there are varieties of ministries , and the same Lord ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	6	and there are varieties of activities , but the same God , who works all things in all people .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is beneficial to all .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit , and to another a word of knowledge by the same Spirit ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another faith by the same Spirit , to another [ b ] gifts of healing by the one Spirit ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	10	to another [ c ] miraculous powers [ d ] , to another [ e ] prophecy , to another [ f ] distinguishing of spirits , to another kinds of tongues , to another [ g ] interpretation of tongues .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But in all these things one and the same Spirit is at work , distributing to each one individually just as he wishes . Unity in the Midst of Diversity
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For by [ i ] one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether slaves or free persons , and all were made to drink one Spirit .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member , but many .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot should say , “ Because I am not a hand , I am not a part of the body , ” not because of this is it not a part of the body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear should say , “ Because I am not an eye , I am not a part of the body , not because of this is it not a part of the body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were hearing , where would the sense of smell be ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now God has placed the members , each one of them , in the body just as he wanted .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they all were one member , where would the body be ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now there are many members , but one body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	21	Now the eye is not able to say to the hand , “ I do not have need of you , ” or again , the head to the feet , “ I do not have need of you. ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	22	But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , these we clothe with more abundant honor , and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	24	but our presentable parts do not have need of this . Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	25	in order that there not be a division in the body , but the members would have the same concern for one another .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And if one member suffers , all the members suffer together ; if a member [ j ] is honored , all the members rejoice with it .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now you are the body of Christ , and members of it individually [ k ] ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	28	and whom God has appointed in the church : first , apostles , second , prophets , third , teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healing , helps , administrations , kinds of tongues .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Not all are apostles , are they ? [ l ] Not all are prophets , are they ? [ m ] Not all are teachers , are they ? [ n ] Not all are workers of miracles , are they ? [ o ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Not all have gifts of healing , do they ? [ p ] Not all speak with tongues , do they ? [ q ] Not all interpret , do they ? [ r ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But strive [ s ] for the greater gifts . And I will show you a still more excellent way . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians 13:12 Literally “ in an indirect image ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now these three things remain : faith , hope , and love . But the greatest of these is love . Footnotes -
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I have the gift of prophecy and I know all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And if I parcel out all my possessions , and if I hand over my body in order that I will be burned , [ a ] but do not have love , it benefits me nothing .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Love is patient , love is kind , love is not jealous , it does not boast , it does not become conceited ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	5	it does not behave dishonorably , it is not selfish [ b ] , it does not become angry , it does not keep a record of wrongs ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	6	it does not rejoice at unrighteousness , but rejoices with the truth ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	7	bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Love never ends . But if there are prophecies , they will pass away . If there are tongues , they will cease . If there is knowledge , it will pass away .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part and we prophesy in part ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but whenever the perfect comes , the partial will pass away .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spoke like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I set aside the things of a child .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we see through a mirror indirectly [ c ] , but then face to face . Now I know in part , but then I will know completely , just as I have also been completely known .

LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians 14:38 Or “ if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God , because no one understands , but by the Spirit [ a ] he speaks mysteries .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But the one who prophesies speaks to people edification and encouragement and consolation .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	4	The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself , but the one who prophesies edifies the church .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	5	Now I want you all to speak with tongues , but even more that you may prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues , unless he interprets , in order that the church may receive edification .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	6	But now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with tongues , how do I benefit you , unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Likewise , the inanimate things which produce a sound , whether flute or lyre , if they do not produce a distinction in the tones , how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For indeed , if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound , who will prepare for battle ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	9	And so you through the tongue , unless you produce a clear message , how will it be known what is spoken ? For you will be speaking into the air .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world , and none without meaning .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	11	Therefore , if I do not know the meaning of the language , I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking , and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	12	In this way also you , since you are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek for the edification of the church , in order that you may abound .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	15	Therefore what should I do [ b ] ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my mind . I will sing praise with my spirit , but I will also sing praise with my mind .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	16	For otherwise , if you praise in your spirit , how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “ amen ” at your thanksgiving , because he does not know what you are saying ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For indeed you are giving thanks well , but the other person is not edified .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	19	but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind , in order that I may instruct other people , than ten thousand words in a tongue .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brothers , do not become children in your understanding , but with respect to wickedness be as a child , and in your understanding be mature .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written : “ By those who speak a foreign language and by the lips of others I will speak to this people , and not even in this way will they obey me , ” [ c ] says the Lord .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	22	So then , tongues are for a sign not to those who believe , but to unbelievers , but prophecy is not for unbelievers , but for those who believe .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore , if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues , and outsiders or unbelievers enter , will they not say that you are out of your minds ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and some unbeliever or outsider enters , he is convicted by all , he is judged by all ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	25	the secret things of his heart become evident , and so , falling on his face , he will worship God , proclaiming , “ God is truly among you ! ” Specific Instructions for Orderly Worship Services
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	26	Therefore what should you do [ d ] , brothers ? Whenever you come together , each one of you has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has a tongue , has an interpretation . All things must be done for edification .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If anyone speaks in a tongue , it must be on one occasion two or at most three , and one after the other [ e ] , and one must interpret .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter , he must be silent in the church , but let him speak to himself and to God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let two or three prophets speak , and the others evaluate .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	30	And if something is revealed to another who is seated , the first must be silent .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For you are all able to prophesy in turn [ f ] , in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	32	and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not a God of disorder but of peace . As in all the churches of the saints ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	34	the women must be silent in the churches , for it is not permitted for them to speak , but they must be in submission , just as the law also says .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	14	35	But if they want to learn something , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church .

LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians 15:58 Here “ because ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ know ” ) which is understood as causal
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	15	And also we are found to be false witnesses of God , because we testified against God that he raised Christ , whom he did not raise if after all , then , the dead are not raised .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	2	by which you are also being saved , if you hold fast to the message I proclaimed to you , unless you believed to no purpose .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I passed on to you as of first importance [ a ] what I also received , that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	4	and that he was buried , and that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	5	and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	6	then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once , the majority of whom remain until now , but some have fallen asleep .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	7	Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	8	and last of all , as it were to one born at the wrong time , he appeared also to me .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles , not worthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace to me has not been in vain , but I labored even more than all of them , and not I , but the grace of God with me .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether I or those , in this way we preached , and in this way you believed . Concerning the Resurrection of the Dead
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ is preached as raised up from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead , Christ has not been raised either .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	14	But if Christ has not been raised , then [ b ] our preaching is in vain , and your faith is in vain .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead are not raised , Christ has not been raised either .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	17	But if Christ has not been raised , your faith is empty ; you are still in your sins .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	18	And as a further result , those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If we have put our hope [ c ] in Christ in this life only , we are of all people most pitiable .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now Christ has been raised from the dead , the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since through a man came death , also through a man came the resurrection of the dead .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For just as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But each in his own group : Christ the first fruits , then those who are Christ ’ s at his coming ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	24	then the end , when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father , when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy to be abolished is death .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For “ he subjected all things under his feet. ” [ d ] But when it says “ all things ” are subjected , it is clear that the one who subjected all things to him is not included .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	28	But whenever all things are subjected to him , then the Son himself will be subjected [ e ] to the one who subjected all things to him , in order that God may be all in all .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , why do they do it , those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead ? If the dead are not raised at all , why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And why are we in danger every hour ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I die every day—yes indeed , by my boasting in you , [ f ] which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If according to a human perspective I fought wild beasts at Ephesus , what benefit is it to me ? If the dead are not raised , let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . [ g ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be deceived ! “ Bad company corrupts good morals. ” [ h ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Sober up correctly and stop sinning [ i ] , for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame . Questions Concerning the Resurrection Body
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But someone will say , “ How are the dead raised ? And with what sort of body do they come ? ”
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Foolish person ! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And what you sow is not the body which it will become , but you sow the bare seed , whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God gives to it a body just as he wishes , and to each one of the seeds its own body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Not all flesh is the same , but there is one flesh of human beings , and another flesh of animals , and another flesh of birds , and another of fish ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	40	and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . But the glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind , and the glory of the earthly bodies is of another kind .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars , for star differs from star in glory .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	42	Thus also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruptibility .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness , it is raised in power .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	45	Thus also it is written , “ The first man , Adam , became a living soul ” ; [ j ] the last Adam became a life-giving spirit .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But the spiritual is not first , but the natural ; then the spiritual .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is from the earth , made of earth ; the second man is from heaven .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As the one who is made of earth , so also are those who are made of earth , and as the heavenly , so also are those who are heavenly .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And just as we have borne the image of the one who is made of earth , we will also bear the image of the heavenly .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	50	But I say this , brothers , that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God , nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I tell you a mystery : we will not all fall asleep , but we will all be changed ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	52	in a moment , in the blink of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound , and the dead will be raised imperishable , and we will be changed .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For it is necessary for this perishable body to put on incorruptibility , and this mortal body to put on immortality .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	54	But whenever this perishable body puts on incorruptibility and this mortal body puts on immortality , then the saying that is written will take place : “ Death is swallowed up in victory .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	55	Where , O death , is your victory ? Where , O death , is your sting ?
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	56	Now the sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ !
LEB	1%20Corinthians	15	58	So then , my dear brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , because you [ k ] know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians 16:22 The Aramaic expression marana tha ( “ O Lord , come ! ” ) can also be rendered maran atha ( “ our Lord has come ” ) ; it is used here by Paul without explanation
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	16	that you also be subject to such people , and to all those who work together and labor .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	2	On the first day of the week , each one of you put aside [ a ] something , saving up to whatever extent he has prospered [ b ] , in order that whenever I come , at that time collections do not take place .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And whenever I arrive , whomever you approve by letters , I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	4	And if it is worthwhile for me to go also , they will travel with me . Travel Plans for Paul and Associates
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	5	But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia ( for I am going through Macedonia ) ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	6	and perhaps I will stay with you , or even spend the winter , so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I do not want to see you now in passing , for I hope to remain some time with you , if the Lord allows it .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	9	for a great and effective door has opened for me , and there are many opponents .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	10	But if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without cause to fear , for he is carrying out the Lord ’ s work , as I also am .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Therefore do not let anyone disdain him , but send him on his way in peace in order that he may come to me , for I am expecting him with the brothers .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	12	Now concerning Apollos our brother , I urged him many times that he should come to you with the brothers , and he was not at all willing that he should come now , but he will come whenever he has an opportunity . Concluding Exhortations
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Be on the alert , stand firm in the faith , act courageously , be strong .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	14	All your actions must be done in love .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	15	Now I urge you , brothers—you know about the household of Stephanas , that they are the first fruits of Achaia , and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints—
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	17	Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus , because these make up for your absence ,
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	18	for they have refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore recognize such people . Final Greetings and Benediction
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of the province of Asia [ c ] greet you . Aquila and Prisca greet you in the Lord many times , together with the church in their house .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brothers greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The greeting is by my hand—Paul ’ s .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If anyone does not love the Lord , let him be accursed . O Lord , come ! [ d ]
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you .
LEB	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Corinthians 1:23 Here “ in order to ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ spare ” ) which is understood as purpose
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , to the church of God that is in Corinth , together with all the saints who are in all Achaia .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	4	who comforts us in all our affliction , so that we may be able to comfort those who are in all affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us , thus through Christ our comfort overflows also .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	6	But if we are afflicted , it is for your comfort and salvation ; if we are comforted , it is for your comfort that is at work in the patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope for you is firm , because we [ a ] know that as you are sharers in the sufferings , so also you will be sharers in the comfort .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we do not want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning our affliction that happened in the province of Asia , [ b ] that we were burdened to an extraordinary degree , beyond our strength , so that we were in despair even of living .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves , so that we would not be putting confidence in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	10	who delivered us from so great a risk of death , and will deliver us , in whom we have put our hope that he will also deliver us again ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	11	while [ c ] you also join in helping on our behalf [ d ] by prayer , so that thanks may be given on our behalf [ e ] by many persons for this gracious gift given to us through the help of many . Paul ’ s Clear Conscience
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our reason for boasting is this : the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world , and especially toward you , in holiness [ f ] and purity of motive from God , not [ g ] in merely human wisdom , but by the grace of God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we are not writing anything else to you except what you can read or also understand . But I hope that you will understand completely [ h ] ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	14	just as you have also understood us in part , that we are your reason for boasting , just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus . Paul Delays His Visit to Corinth
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And with this confidence , I was wanting to come to you previously , in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	16	and through you to go to Macedonia , and to come to you again from Macedonia , and to be sent on my way by you to Judea .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	17	Therefore , when I [ i ] was wanting to do this , perhaps then was I making use of vacillation ? Or was I deciding what I was deciding according to the flesh , in order that with me my “ yes ” may be “ yes ” and my “ no ” may be “ no ” at the same time ? [ j ]
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But God is faithful , so that our word to you is not “ yes ” and “ no. ”
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , the one who was proclaimed among you by us , by me and Silvanus and Timothy , did not become “ yes ” and “ no , ” but has become “ yes ” in him .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For as many as are the promises of God , in him they are “ yes ” ; therefore also through him is the “ amen ” to the glory of God through us .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now the one who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anoints us is God ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	22	who also sealed us and gave the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	23	But I call upon God as witness against my life , that in order to [ k ] spare you , I did not come again to Corinth .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not that we lord it over your faith , but we are fellow workers for your joy , because by faith you stand firm . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	2	Corinthians 2:13 This infinitive ( “ find ” ) is understood as causal
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this very thing in order that when I [ a ] came , I would not experience sorrow from those who ought to have made me glad , because I [ b ] have confidence about you all , that my joy belongs to all of you [ c ] .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears , not so that you may be caused to be sad , but so that you may know the love that I have especially for you . Forgive and Comfort the Offender
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if anyone has caused sorrow , he has not caused me sorrow , but to some degree [ d ] —in order not to say too much [ e ] —to all of you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	6	This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	7	So then , you should rather forgive and comfort him , lest somehow this person should be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Therefore I urge you to confirm your love for him .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	9	Because for this reason also I wrote , in order that I could know your proven character , whether you are obedient in everything .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	10	Now to whomever you forgive anything , I also do ; for indeed , whatever I have forgiven , if I have forgiven anything , it is for your sake [ f ] in the presence of Christ ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	11	in order that we may not be exploited by Satan ( for we are not ignorant of his schemes ) . Triumphant Ministry in Christ
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Now when I [ g ] arrived in Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was opened for me by the Lord ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I did not experience rest in my spirit , because [ h ] I did not find Titus my brother , but saying farewell to them , I departed for Macedonia .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	14	But thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ , and who reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of him through us in every place .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	16	to those on the one hand an odor from death to death , and to those on the other hand a fragrance from life to life . And who is qualified for these things ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not like the majority who peddle the word of God , but as from pure motives—but as from God—we speak before God in Christ . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Corinthians 3:18 Or “ contemplating ”
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	3	revealing that you are a letter of Christ , delivered by us , inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God , not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	4	Now we possess such confidence through Christ toward God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves , but our adequacy is from God ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	6	who also makes us adequate as servants of a new covenant , not of the letter , but of the Spirit , for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministry of death in letters carved on stone came with glory , so that the sons of Israel were not able to look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his face , which was transitory ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	8	how will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more with glory ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation , by much more will the ministry of righteousness overflow with glory .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For indeed what had been glorified has not been glorified in this case , on account of the glory that surpasses it .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if what was transitory came with glory , by much more what remains is with glory .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Therefore , because we [ a ] have such a hope , we use much boldness ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	13	and not as Moses used to place a veil over his face , in order that the sons of Israel would not stare at the end of what was transitory .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were hardened . For until this very day , the same veil remains upon the reading of the old covenant , not being uncovered , because it is done away with in Christ .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But until today , whenever Moses is read aloud , a veil lies upon their heart ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	16	but whenever one turns to the Lord , the veil is removed .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is the Spirit , and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	3	18	And we all , with unveiled face , reflecting [ b ] the glory of the Lord , are being transformed into the same image from glory into glory , just as from the Lord , the Spirit . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	2	Corinthians 4:18 Here “ because ” is supplied as a component of the causal genitive absolute participle ( “ looking at ” )
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	4	among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers , so that they would not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But if indeed our gospel is veiled , it is veiled among those who are perishing ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we do not proclaim ourselves , but Christ Jesus [ b ] as Lord , and ourselves as your slaves for the sake of Jesus .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God who said , “ Light will shine out of darkness , ” [ c ] is the one who has shined in our hearts for the enlightenment of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ . [ d ] Treasure in Earthenware Jars
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthenware jars , in order that the extraordinary degree of the power may be from God and not from us .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are afflicted in every way , but not crushed ; perplexed , but not despairing ;
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	9	persecuted , but not abandoned ; struck down , but not destroyed ;
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	10	always carrying around the death of Jesus in our body , in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we who are alive are continually being handed over to death because of Jesus , in order that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then , death is at work in us , but life in you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	13	But because we [ e ] have the same spirit of faith in accordance with what is written , “ I believed , therefore I spoke , ” [ f ] we also believe , therefore we also speak ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	14	because we [ g ] know that the one who raised Jesus [ h ] will also raise us together with Jesus and present us together with you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all these things are for your sake [ i ] , in order that the grace that is increasing through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	16	Therefore we do not lose heart , but even if our outer person is being destroyed , yet our inner person is being renewed day after day .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our momentary light affliction is producing in us an eternal weight of glory beyond all measure and proportion [ j ] ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	4	18	because [ k ] we are not looking at what is seen , but what is not seen . For what is seen is temporary , but what is not seen is eternal . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	2	Corinthians 5:20 Here “ if ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ were imploring ” ) which is understood as conditional
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now the one who has prepared us for this very thing is God , who has given us the down payment , the Spirit .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	3	if indeed , even after we [ b ] have taken it off , [ c ] we will not be found naked .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For indeed we who are in this tent groan , being burdened for this reason , that [ d ] we do not want to be unclothed , but to be clothed , in order that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore , although we are [ e ] always confident and know that while we [ f ] are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for we live by faith , not by sight—
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	8	so we are confident and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Therefore indeed we have as our ambition , whether at home in the body or absent from the body , to be acceptable to him .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ , in order that each one may receive back the things through the body according to what he has done , whether good or bad . Controlled by the Love of Christ
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Therefore , because we [ g ] know the fear of the Lord , we are attempting to persuade people , but we are revealed to God , and I hope to be revealed in your consciences .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not commending ourselves to you again , but are giving you an opportunity to boast about us , in order that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For if we are out of our senses , it is for God ; if we are of sound mind , it is for you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ controls us , because we [ h ] have concluded this : that one died for all ; as a result all died .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And he died for all , in order that those who live should no longer live for themselves , but for the one who died for them and was raised .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	16	So then , from now on we know no one from a human point of view [ i ] , if indeed we have known Christ from a human point of view [ j ] , but now we know him this way no longer .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ , he is a new creation ; the old things have passed away ; behold , new things have come .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	18	And all these things are from God , who has reconciled us to himself through Christ , and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	19	namely , that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself , not counting their trespasses against them , and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Therefore we are ambassadors on behalf of Christ , as if [ k ] God were imploring you through us . We beg you on behalf of Christ , be reconciled to God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	5	21	He made the one who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf , in order that we could become the righteousness of God in him . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	6	in purity , in knowledge , in patience , in kindness , in the Holy Spirit , in love without hypocrisy ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	3	We are giving no one an occasion for taking offense in anything , in order that our ministry will not have fault found with it ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	4	but commending ourselves as servants of God in every way , in much endurance , in afflictions , in distresses , in difficulties ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	5	in beatings , in prisons , in disturbances , in troubles , in sleepless nights , in going hungry ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	7	in the word of truth , in the power of God , with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and left hand ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	8	through glory and dishonor , through slander and good repute , regarded as deceivers and yet truthful ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	9	as unknown and yet known completely , as dying , and behold , we go on living , as disciplined , and yet not put to death ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	10	as grieving , but always rejoicing , as poor , but making many rich , as having nothing , and possessing everything .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	11	We have spoken freely and openly [ c ] to you , Corinthians ; our heart is open wide .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	12	You are not restricted by us , but you are restricted in your affections .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	13	Now the same way in exchange ( I am speaking as to children ) , you open wide your hearts also . Do Not Become Unevenly Yoked with Unbelievers
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers , for what participation is there between righteousness and lawlessness ? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	15	And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar ? Or what share does a believer have with an unbeliever ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols ? For we are the temple of the living God , just as God said , “ I will live in [ d ] them and will walk about among them , and I will be their God and they will be my people. ” [ e ]
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Therefore “ come out from their midst and be separate , ” says the Lord , “ and do not touch what is unclean , [ f ] and I will welcome you , [ g ]
LEB	2%20Corinthians	6	18	and I will be a father to you , and you will be sons and daughters to me , ” [ h ] says the all-powerful Lord . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Corinthians 7:15 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ remembers ” ) which is understood as temporal
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	7	and not only by his coming , but also by the comfort with which he was comforted among you , because he [ e ] reported to us your longing , your mourning , your zeal for me , so that I rejoiced even more .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I do not say this to condemn you [ c ] , because I have already said that you are in our hearts , so that we die together and we live together .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my confidence toward you ; great is my boasting on your behalf ; I am filled with encouragement ; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For even when [ d ] we arrived in Macedonia , our body had no rest , but we were afflicted in every way—quarrels outside , fears within .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	6	But God , who comforts the humble , comforted us by the coming of Titus ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For if indeed I grieved you by my letter , I do not regret it . Even if I did regret it ( I see [ f ] that that letter grieved you , even though for a short time [ g ] ) ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	9	now I rejoice , not that you were grieved , but that you were grieved to repentance . For you were grieved according to the will of God , so that you suffered loss in no way through us .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For grief according to the will of God brings about a repentance leading to salvation , not to be regretted , but worldly grief brings about death .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold how much diligence this very thing , being grieved according to the will of God , has brought about in you : what defense of yourselves , what indignation , what fear , what longing , what zeal , what punishment ! In everything you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Consequently , even if I wrote to you , it was not because of the one who did wrong or because of the one who had been wronged , but in order that your diligence on our behalf [ h ] might be revealed to you before God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Because of this we have been encouraged , and in addition to our encouragement , we rejoiced much more over the joy of Titus , because his spirit had been refreshed by all of you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted anything to him about you , I have not been put to shame , but as I have spoken everything to you in truth , thus also our boasting to Titus has proven to be true [ i ] .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his affection for you is all the more when he [ j ] remembers the obedience of all of you as you welcomed him with fear and trembling .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice , because in everything I am completely confident in you . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	2	Corinthians 8:24 Literally “ to the face of ”
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I am not saying this as a command , but proving the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	3	I testify that they gave [ a ] according to their ability , and beyond their ability , by their own choice ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	4	requesting of us with much exhortation the favor and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	5	and not just as we had hoped , but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us , by the will of God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	6	So we urged Titus that , just as he had previously begun it , thus he would also complete for you this act of grace .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	7	But just as you excel in everything—in faith and in speaking and in knowledge and with all diligence and in the love from us that is in you—so may you excel in this grace also .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that although he [ b ] was rich , for your sake he became poor , in order that you , by his poverty , may become rich .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And I am giving an opinion in this matter , because this is profitable for you who not only began previously , a year ago , to do something , but also to want to do it .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	11	So now also complete the doing of it , in order that just as you have the eagerness to want to do it , thus also you may complete it from what you have .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if the eagerness is present according to what one has [ c ] , it is acceptable not according to what one does not have [ d ] .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For this is not that for others there may be relief , and for you difficult circumstances , but as a matter of equality .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	14	At the present time your abundance will be for their need , in order that their abundance may also be for your need , so that there may be equality ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	15	just as it is written , “ The one who gathered much did not have too much , and the one who gathered little did not have too little. ” [ e ] Arrangements for Administering the Corinthians ’ Gift
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God , who has put in the heart of Titus the same devotion on your behalf [ f ] ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	17	because he not only welcomed our request , but being very earnest , by his own choice he went out [ g ] to you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent at the same time with him the brother whose praise in the gospel has become known throughout all the churches .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And not only this , but he was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion together with this gift that is being administered by us to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	20	We are trying to avoid this , lest anyone should find fault with us in this abundant gift that is being administered by us .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	21	For we are taking into consideration what is honorable not only before the Lord , but also before people .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times in many things that he is diligent , but now much more diligent because of his great confidence in you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	23	If there is a question concerning Titus , he is my partner and fellow worker for you . If there is a question concerning our brothers , they are messengers of the churches , the glory of Christ .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Therefore show to them the proof of your love and our boasting about you openly before [ h ] the churches . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	2	Corinthians 9:9 A quotation from Ps 112:9
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	9	Just as it is written ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	3	But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you would not prove to be empty in this case , so that you may be prepared just as I was saying ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	4	lest somehow if Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared , we—not to speak of you [ a ] —would be humiliated in connection with this project .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they should go on ahead to you and make arrangements in advance for your generous gift that was promised previously , so this would be prepared as a generous gift and not as grudgingly granted .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	6	Now the point is this : the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly , and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Each one should give as he has decided in his heart , not reluctantly [ b ] or from compulsion , for God loves a cheerful giver .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to cause all grace to abound to you , so that in everything at all times , because you [ c ] have enough of everything , you may overflow in every good work .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now the one who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed , and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	11	being made rich in every way for all generosity , which is producing through us thanksgiving to God ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	12	because the service of this ministry is not only supplying the needs of the saints , but also is overflowing through many expressions of thanksgiving to God .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Through the proven character of this service they will glorify God because of the submission of your confession to the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your participation toward them and toward everyone ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	9	14	and they are longing for you in their prayers for you , because of the surpassing grace of God to you .

LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	2	Corinthians 10:17 A quotation from Jer 9:24
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	10	because it is said , “ His letters are severe and powerful , but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is of no account. ”
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For although we [ d ] are living in the flesh , we do not wage war according to the flesh ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	4	for the weapons of our warfare are not merely human , but powerful to God for the tearing down of fortresses , tearing down arguments
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	5	and all pride that is raised up against the knowledge of God , and taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And we are ready [ e ] to punish all disobedience , whenever your obedience is completed .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	7	You are looking at things according to appearance . If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ ’ s , he should consider this concerning himself again : that just as Christ himself is , so also are we .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down [ f ] , I will not be put to shame ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	9	so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such a person consider this : that what we are in word by letters when we [ g ] are absent , we will also be in actions [ h ] when we [ i ] are present .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves , but they themselves , when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves , do not understand .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast beyond limits [ j ] , but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we are not overextending ourselves , as if we [ k ] had not reached you , because we have reached even as far as you with the gospel of Christ ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	15	not boasting beyond limits [ l ] in the labors of others , but having hope that as your faith is growing to be enlarged greatly by you according to our assignment ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	16	so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you , and not boast in the things accomplished in the area assigned to someone else .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But “ the one who boasts , let him boast in the Lord. ” [ m ]

LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	2	Corinthians 11:31 Literally “ to the ages ”
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Why [ g ] ? Because I do not love you ? God knows I do !
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I am afraid lest somehow , as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness , your minds may be led astray from the sincerity and the purity of devotion to Christ .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if the one who comes proclaims another Jesus whom we have not proclaimed , or you receive a different spirit which you did not receive , or a different gospel which you did not accept , you put up with it well enough !
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I consider myself in no way to be inferior to the preeminent apostles . [ b ]
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But even if I am unskilled in speech , yet I am not in knowledge ; certainly in everything we have made this clear to you in every way .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Or did I commit a sin by [ c ] humbling myself in order that you may be exalted , because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you without payment ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches by [ d ] accepting support from them for the ministry to you .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I [ e ] was present with you and was in need , I did not burden anyone , for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need , and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you , and will keep myself from being a burden .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , this boasting of mine [ f ] will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I am doing , I will also do , in order that I may remove the opportunity of those who want an opportunity , that they may be found just as also we are in what they are boasting about .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such people are false apostles , deceitful workers , disguising themselves as apostles of Christ .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no wonder , for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness , whose end will be according to their deeds . Paul Boasts in His Sufferings
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	16	Again I say , do not let anyone think I am foolish . But indeed , if you do , accept me even as foolish , in order that I also may boast a little .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	17	What I am saying in this project of boasting , I am not saying as the Lord would say , but as in foolishness .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Since many are boasting according to human standards , I also will boast .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For because you [ h ] are wise , you put up with foolish people gladly !
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For you put up with it if someone enslaves you , if someone devours you , if someone takes advantage of you , if someone is presumptious toward you , if someone strikes you in the face .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I say this to my shame , namely , that we have been weak . But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am speaking in foolishness—I also dare to boast .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? I am also ! Are they Israelites ? I am also ! Are they descendants of Abraham ? I am also !
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they servants of Christ ? —I am speaking as though I were beside myself—I am more so , with far greater labors , with far more imprisonments , with beatings to a much greater degree , in danger of death many times .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Five times I received at the hands of the Jews forty lashes less one .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Three times I was beaten with rods . Once I received a stoning . Three times I was shipwrecked . A day and a night I have spent in the deep water .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	26	I have been on journeys many times , in dangers from rivers , in dangers from robbers , in dangers from my own people , in dangers from the Gentiles , in dangers in the city , in dangers in the wilderness , in dangers at sea , in dangers because of false brothers ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	27	with toil and hardship , often in sleepless nights , with hunger and thirst , often going hungry , in cold and poorly clothed .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Apart from these external things , there is the pressure on me every day of the anxiety about all the churches .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? Who is caused to sin , and I do not burn with indignation ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If it is necessary to boast , I will boast about the things related to my weakness [ i ] .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of the Lord Jesus , who is blessed forever [ j ] , knows that I am not lying .

LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	2	Corinthians 12:21 Literally “ with you ”
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	12	Indeed , the signs of an apostle have been done among you with all patient endurance , both signs and wonders and deeds of power .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	3	and I know this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know , God knows—
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	4	that he was caught up to paradise and heard words not to be spoken , which it is not permitted for a person to speak .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	5	On behalf of such a person I will boast , but on behalf of myself I will not boast , except in my weaknesses .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For if I want to boast , I will not be foolish , because I will be telling the truth , but I am refraining , so that no one can credit to me more than what he sees in me or hears anything from me ,
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	7	even because of the extraordinary degree of the revelations . Therefore , so that I would not exalt myself , a thorn in the flesh was given to me , a messenger of Satan , in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	8	Three times I appealed to the Lord about this , that it would depart from me .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he said to me , “ My grace is sufficient for you , because the [ a ] power is perfected in weakness. ” Therefore rather I will boast most gladly in my weaknesses , in order that the power of Christ may reside in me .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I delight in weaknesses , in insults , in calamities , in persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ , for whenever I am weak , then I am strong . Paul ’ s Concern for the Christians at Corinth
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I have become a fool ! You compelled me , for I ought to have been commended by you , for I am in no way inferior to the preeminent apostles , [ b ] even if I am nothing .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For in what respect are you made worse off [ c ] more than the rest of the churches , except that I myself was not a burden to you ? Forgive me this wrong !
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , this third time I am ready to come to you , and I will not be a burden to you . For I am not seeking your possessions , but you . For children are not obligated to save up for their parents , but parents for their children .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	15	But I will spend and be expended most gladly for your lives . If I love you much more , am I to be loved less ?
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But let it be . I have not been a burden to you , but because I [ d ] was crafty , I took you by cunning .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	17	I have not taken advantage of you through anyone whom I sent to you [ e ] , have I ? [ f ]
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I urged Titus to go , and I sent the brother with him . Titus did not take advantage of you , did he ? [ g ] Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit ? [ h ] Did we not walk in the same footsteps ? [ i ]
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Have you been thinking all this time that we are defending ourselves to you ? We are speaking in Christ before God , and all these things , dear friends , are for your edification .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I am afraid lest somehow when I [ j ] arrive , I will not find you as I want , and I may be found by you as you do not want . I am afraid [ k ] lest somehow there will be strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , selfish ambition , slander , gossip , pride , disorder .
LEB	2%20Corinthians	12	21	I am afraid lest when I [ l ] come again my God will humiliate me in your presence [ m ] , and I will grieve over many of those who sinned previously and have not repented because of their impurity and sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced .

LEB	Galatians	1	13	For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism , that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God , and trying to destroy it ,
LEB	Galatians	1	14	and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation , because [ c ] I was a far more zealous adherent of the traditions handed down by my forefathers .
LEB	Galatians	1	15	But when the one who set me apart [ d ] from my mother ’ s womb and called me by his grace was pleased
LEB	Galatians	1	16	to reveal his Son in me in order that I would proclaim the gospel about him among the Gentiles , immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood ,
LEB	Galatians	1	17	nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus .
LEB	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas , and I stayed with him fifteen days ,
LEB	Galatians	1	19	but I did not see any others of the apostles except James , the brother of the Lord .
LEB	Galatians	1	20	( Now the things which I am writing to you , behold , I assure you before God that I am not lying . )
LEB	Galatians	1	21	Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia ,
LEB	Galatians	1	22	but I was unknown in person [ e ] to the churches of Judea that are in Christ ,
LEB	Galatians	1	23	and they were only hearing , “ The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy , ”
LEB	Galatians	1	24	and they were glorifying God because of me .

LEB	Galatians	2	2	Now I went up there because of a revelation and laid out to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles , but in private to the influential people , lest somehow I was running , or had run , in vain .
LEB	Galatians	2	3	But not even Titus who was with me , although [ a ] he was a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised .
LEB	Galatians	2	4	Now this was because of the false brothers secretly brought in , who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus , in order that they might enslave us ,
LEB	Galatians	2	5	to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection , in order that the truth of the gospel might remain continually with you .
LEB	Galatians	2	6	But from those who were influential [ b ] ( whatever they were , it makes no difference to me , God does not show partiality [ c ] ) —for those who were influential added nothing to me .
LEB	Galatians	2	7	But these , when they [ d ] saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision , just as Peter to the circumcision
LEB	Galatians	2	8	( for the one who was at work through Peter for his apostleship to the circumcision was at work also through me for the Gentiles ) ,
LEB	Galatians	2	9	and when James and Cephas and John—those thought to be pillars—acknowledged the grace given to me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship , in order that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision .
LEB	Galatians	2	10	They asked only that we should remember the poor , the very thing I was also eager to do . Paul Confronts Peter at Antioch
LEB	Galatians	2	11	But when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he was condemned .
LEB	Galatians	2	12	For before certain people came from James , he used to eat with the Gentiles , but when they came , he withdrew and separated himself , because he [ e ] was afraid of those who were of the circumcision ,
LEB	Galatians	2	13	and the rest of the Jews also joined in this hypocrisy with him , so that even Barnabas was carried away with them in their hypocrisy .
LEB	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they were not being straightforward with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in the presence of them all , “ If you , although you [ f ] are a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you try to compel the Gentiles to live like Jews ? ” Justified by Faith in Christ
LEB	Galatians	2	15	We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles ,
LEB	Galatians	2	16	but knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law , if not by faith in Jesus Christ , [ g ] and we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ [ h ] and not by the works of the law , because by the works of the law no human being will be justified [ i ] .
LEB	Galatians	2	17	But if while seeking to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also have been found to be sinners , then is Christ an agent of sin ? May it never be !
LEB	Galatians	2	18	For if I build up again these things which I destroyed , I show myself to be a transgressor .
LEB	Galatians	2	19	For through the law I died to the law , in order that I might live to God . I have been crucified with Christ ,
LEB	Galatians	2	20	and I no longer live , but Christ lives in me , and that life I now live in the flesh , I live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave himself for me .
LEB	Galatians	2	21	I do not declare invalid the grace of God , for if righteousness is through the law , then Christ died to no purpose .

LEB	Galatians	3	3	Are you so foolish ? Having begun by the Spirit , are you now trying to be made complete by the flesh ?
LEB	Galatians	3	2	I want only to learn this from you : Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
LEB	Galatians	3	4	Have you suffered so many things for nothing—if indeed also it was for nothing ?
LEB	Galatians	3	5	Therefore does the one who gives you the Spirit and who works miracles among you do so by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
LEB	Galatians	3	6	Just as Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him for righteousness ,
LEB	Galatians	3	7	then understand that the ones who have faith [ a ] , these are sons of Abraham .
LEB	Galatians	3	8	And the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham : “ In you all the nations [ b ] will be blessed. ” [ c ]
LEB	Galatians	3	9	So then , the ones who have faith are blessed together with Abraham who believed .
LEB	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse , for it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all the things that are written in the book of the law to do them. ” [ d ]
LEB	Galatians	3	11	Now it is clear that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law , because “ the one who is righteous will live by faith. ” [ e ]
LEB	Galatians	3	12	But the law is not from faith , but “ the one who does these things will live by them. ” [ f ]
LEB	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by [ g ] becoming a curse for us , because it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree , ” [ h ]
LEB	Galatians	3	14	in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus , so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith . The Promise to Abraham and His Descendant
LEB	Galatians	3	15	Brothers , I am speaking according to a human perspective . Nevertheless , when [ i ] the covenant of a man has been ratified , no one declares it invalid or adds additional provisions to it .
LEB	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and to his descendant the promises were spoken . It does not say , “ and to descendants , ” as concerning many , but as concerning one , “ and to your descendant , ” [ j ] who is Christ .
LEB	Galatians	3	17	Now I am saying this : the law , that came after four hundred and thirty years , does not revoke a covenant previously ratified by God , in order to nullify the promise .
LEB	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance is from the law , it is no longer from the promise , but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise . The Addition of the Law
LEB	Galatians	3	19	Why then the law ? It was added on account of transgressions , until the descendant should come to whom it had been promised , having been ordered through angels by the hand of a mediator .
LEB	Galatians	3	20	Now the mediator is not for one , but God is one .
LEB	Galatians	3	21	Therefore is the law opposed to the promises of God ? May it never be ! For if a law had been given that was able to give life , certainly righteousness would have been from the law .
LEB	Galatians	3	22	But the scripture imprisoned all under sin , in order that the promise could be given by faith [ k ] in Jesus Christ to those who believe .
LEB	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were detained under the law , imprisoned until the coming faith was revealed .
LEB	Galatians	3	24	So then , the law became our guardian until Christ , in order that we could be justified by faith .
LEB	Galatians	3	25	But after [ l ] faith has come , we are no longer under a guardian .
LEB	Galatians	3	26	For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus , [ m ]
LEB	Galatians	3	27	for as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
LEB	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male and female , for you are all one in Christ Jesus .
LEB	Galatians	3	29	And if you are Christ ’ s , then you are descendants of Abraham , heirs according to the promise .

LEB	Galatians	4	4	But when the fullness of time came , God sent out his Son , born of a woman , born under the law ,
LEB	Galatians	4	2	but he is under guardians and managers until the time set by his father .
LEB	Galatians	4	3	So also we , when we were children , we were enslaved under the elemental spirits of the world .
LEB	Galatians	4	5	in order that he might redeem those under the law , in order that we might receive the adoption .
LEB	Galatians	4	6	And because you are sons , God sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts , crying out , “ Abba ! [ b ] ( Father ! ) , ”
LEB	Galatians	4	7	so that you are no longer a slave but a son , and if a son , also an heir through God . Do Not Be Enslaved Again
LEB	Galatians	4	8	But at that time when you [ c ] did not know God , you were enslaved to the things which by nature are not gods .
LEB	Galatians	4	9	But now , because you have come to know God , or rather have come to be known by God , how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits ? Do you want to be enslaved to them [ d ] all over again ?
LEB	Galatians	4	10	You carefully observe days and months and seasons and years .
LEB	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid for you , lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain !
LEB	Galatians	4	12	I ask you , brothers , become like me , because I also have become like you . You have done me no wrong ! Paul ’ s Personal Appeal
LEB	Galatians	4	13	But you know that because of an illness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time .
LEB	Galatians	4	14	And you did not despise or disdain what was a trial for you in my flesh , but you welcomed me like an angel of God , like Christ Jesus .
LEB	Galatians	4	15	So where is your blessing ? For I testify to you that , if possible , you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me !
LEB	Galatians	4	16	So then , have I become your enemy by [ e ] being truthful to you ?
LEB	Galatians	4	17	They zealously seek you , not commendably , but they want to exclude you , in order that you may seek them zealously .
LEB	Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be sought zealously in good at all times , and not only when I am present with you .
LEB	Galatians	4	19	My children , for whom I am having birth pains again , until Christ is formed in you !
LEB	Galatians	4	20	But I could wish to be present with you now , and to change my tone because I am perplexed about you . Hagar and Sarah Represent Two Covenants
LEB	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , you who are wanting to be under the law , do you not understand [ f ] the law ?
LEB	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the female slave and one by the free woman .
LEB	Galatians	4	23	But the one by the female slave was born according to human descent , and the one by the free woman through the promise ,
LEB	Galatians	4	24	which things are spoken allegorically , for these women are two covenants , one from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery , who is Hagar .
LEB	Galatians	4	25	Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is a slave with her children .
LEB	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is free , which is our mother .
LEB	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , “ Rejoice , O barren woman , who does not give birth to children ; burst out and shout , you who do not have birth pains , because many are the children of the desolate woman , even more than those of the one who has a husband. ” [ g ]
LEB	Galatians	4	28	But you , brothers , are children of the promise , just as Isaac .
LEB	Galatians	4	29	But just as at that time the child born according to human descent persecuted the child born according to the Spirit , so also now .
LEB	Galatians	4	30	But what does the scripture say ? “ Drive out the female slave and her son , for the son of the female slave will never inherit with the son ” [ h ] of the free woman .
LEB	Galatians	4	31	Therefore , brothers , we are not children of the female slave but of the free woman .

LEB	Galatians	5	5	For through the Spirit by faith we eagerly await the hope of righteousness .
LEB	Galatians	5	2	Look ! I , Paul , tell you that if you become circumcised , Christ will profit you nothing !
LEB	Galatians	5	3	And again I testify to every man who becomes circumcised , that he is under obligation to keep the whole law .
LEB	Galatians	5	4	You are estranged from Christ , you who are attempting to be justified [ a ] by the law ; you have fallen from grace .
LEB	Galatians	5	6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision , but faith working through love .
LEB	Galatians	5	7	You were running well . Who hindered you from obeying the truth ?
LEB	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion is not from the one who calls you !
LEB	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough .
LEB	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will think nothing different , but the one who is confusing you will pay the penalty [ b ] , whoever he may be .
LEB	Galatians	5	11	Now , brothers , if I am still preaching circumcision , why am I still being persecuted ? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished .
LEB	Galatians	5	12	I wish that the ones who are disturbing you would also castrate themselves [ c ] !
LEB	Galatians	5	13	For you were called to freedom , brothers . Only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the flesh , but through love serve one another .
LEB	Galatians	5	14	For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement , namely , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ” [ d ]
LEB	Galatians	5	15	But if you bite and devour one another , watch out that you are not consumed by one another . Live by the Spirit and Reject the Deeds of the Flesh
LEB	Galatians	5	16	But I say , live by the Spirit , and you will never carry out the desire of the flesh .
LEB	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh desires against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh , for these are in opposition to one another , so that whatever you want , you may not do these things .
LEB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are led by the Spirit , you are not under the law .
LEB	Galatians	5	19	Now the deeds of the flesh are evident , which are sexual immorality , impurity , licentiousness ,
LEB	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , sorcery , enmity , strife , jealousy , outbursts of anger , selfish ambition , dissension , factions ,
LEB	Galatians	5	21	envy , drunkenness , carousing , and things like these , things which I am telling you in advance , just as I said before , that the ones who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God .
LEB	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , goodness , faithfulness ,
LEB	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , self control . Against such things there is no law .
LEB	Galatians	5	24	Now those who belong to Christ [ e ] [ f ] have crucified the flesh together with its feelings and its desires .
LEB	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , we must also follow the Spirit .
LEB	Galatians	5	26	We must not become conceited , provoking one another , envying one another .

LEB	Galatians	6	6	Now the one who is taught the word must share in all good things with the one who teaches .
LEB	Galatians	6	2	Carry the burdens of one another , and so fulfill the law of Christ .
LEB	Galatians	6	3	For if anyone thinks he is something although he [ a ] is nothing , he is deceiving himself .
LEB	Galatians	6	4	But let each one examine his own work , and then he will have a reason for boasting in himself alone , and not in someone else .
LEB	Galatians	6	5	For each one will carry his own burden . Do Good to All People
LEB	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived : God is not to be mocked , for whatever a person sows , this he will also reap ,
LEB	Galatians	6	8	because the one who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh , but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit .
LEB	Galatians	6	9	And let us not grow weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap , if we [ b ] do not give up .
LEB	Galatians	6	10	So then , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , and especially to those who belong to the household of faith . A Final Warning
LEB	Galatians	6	11	See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand .
LEB	Galatians	6	12	As many as are wanting to make a good showing in the flesh , these are attempting to compel [ c ] you to be circumcised , only so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ .
LEB	Galatians	6	13	For not even those who are circumcised observe the law themselves , but they want you to be circumcised in order that they may boast in your flesh .
LEB	Galatians	6	14	But as for me , may it never be that I boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom the world has been crucified to me , and I to the world .
LEB	Galatians	6	15	For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision , but a new creation .
LEB	Galatians	6	16	And all those who follow this rule , peace and mercy be on them and on the Israel of God . Conclusion and Benediction
LEB	Galatians	6	17	Finally , let no one cause me trouble , for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus .
LEB	Galatians	6	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brothers . Amen .

LEB	Ephesians	3	3	According to [ a ] revelation the mystery was made known to me , just as I wrote beforehand in brief ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	2	—if indeed you have heard about the stewardship of God ’ s grace given to me for you .
LEB	Ephesians	3	4	so that you may be able when you read [ b ] to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ
LEB	Ephesians	3	5	( which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ) :
LEB	Ephesians	3	6	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	7	of which I became a servant , according to the gift of God ’ s grace given to me , according to the working of his power .
LEB	Ephesians	3	8	To me , the least of all the saints , was given this grace : to proclaim the good news of the fathomless riches of Christ to the Gentiles ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	9	and to enlighten everyone as to what is the administration of the mystery hidden from the ages by God , who created all things ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	10	in order that the many-sided wisdom of God might be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places through the church ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	11	according to the purpose of the ages which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in him . [ c ]
LEB	Ephesians	3	13	Therefore I ask you [ d ] not to be discouraged at my afflictions on behalf of you , which are your glory . Prayer for Spiritual Strength
LEB	Ephesians	3	14	On account of this , I bend my knees before the Father ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every [ e ] family in heaven and on earth is named ,
LEB	Ephesians	3	16	that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person ,

LEB	Ephesians	4	4	one body and one Spirit ( just as also you were called with one hope of your calling ) ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	2	with all humility and gentleness , with patience , putting up with one another in love ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	3	being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace ;
LEB	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who is over all , and through all , and in all . Gifted Leaders Bring the Church to Maturity
LEB	Ephesians	4	7	Now to each one of us was given this grace , according to the measure of Christ ’ s gift .
LEB	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore it says , “ Ascending on high he led captivity captive ; he gave gifts to men. ” [ a ]
LEB	Ephesians	4	9	Now “ he ascended , ” what is it , except that he also descended [ b ] to the lower regions of the earth ?
LEB	Ephesians	4	10	The one who descended himself is also the one who ascended above all the heavens , in order that he might fill all things .
LEB	Ephesians	4	11	And he himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers
LEB	Ephesians	4	12	for the equipping of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for building up the body of Christ ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	13	until we all reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God , to a mature man , to a measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	14	so that we may no longer be infants , tossed about by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching , by the trickery of people , by craftiness with reference to the scheming of deceit .
LEB	Ephesians	4	15	But speaking the truth in love , we are to grow into him with reference to all things , who is the head , Christ ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	16	from whom the whole body , joined together and held together by every supporting ligament , according to the working by measure of each single part , the growth of the body makes for the building up of itself in love . Appeal for New Behavior
LEB	Ephesians	4	17	This therefore I say and testify in the Lord , that you no longer walk as the Gentiles walk : in the futility of their mind ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	18	being darkened in understanding , alienated from the life of God , because of the ignorance that is in them , because of the hardness of their heart ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	19	who , becoming callous , gave themselves over to licentiousness , for the pursuit of all uncleanness in greediness .
LEB	Ephesians	4	20	But you did not learn Christ in this way ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	21	if indeed you have heard about him , and you were taught by him ( just as truth is in Jesus ) ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	22	that you take off , according to your former way of life , the old man , who is being destroyed according to deceitful desires ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	23	be renewed in the spirit of your mind ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	24	and put on the new man ( in accordance with God ) , who is created in righteousness and holiness from the truth . Old Behavior , New Behavior , and Motivation
LEB	Ephesians	4	25	Therefore , putting aside the lie , speak truth each one of you with his neighbor , [ c ] because we are members of one another .
LEB	Ephesians	4	26	Be angry and do not sin ; [ d ] do not let the sun set on your anger ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	27	nor give place to the devil .
LEB	Ephesians	4	28	The one who steals must steal no longer , but instead must labor , working with his own hands what is good , so that he may have something to share with the one who has need .
LEB	Ephesians	4	29	No rotten word must proceed [ e ] from your mouth , but only something good for the building up of the need , in order that it may give grace to those who hear ,
LEB	Ephesians	4	30	and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption .
LEB	Ephesians	4	31	All bitterness , and rage , and wrath , and clamor , and abusive speech , must be removed from you , together with all wickedness .

LEB	Ephesians	5	5	For this you know for certain [ b ] , that every sexually immoral person , or unclean person , or greedy person ( who is an idolater ) , does not have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God .
LEB	Ephesians	5	2	and live in love , just as also Christ loved us , and gave himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a fragrant smell . [ a ]
LEB	Ephesians	5	3	But sexual immorality , and all uncleanness , or greediness , must not even be named among you ( as is fitting for saints ) ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	4	and obscenity , and foolish talk , or coarse jesting ( which are not proper ) , but rather thanksgiving .
LEB	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with empty words , for because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience . Walk Like Children of Light
LEB	Ephesians	5	7	Therefore do not be sharers [ c ] with them ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	8	for you were formerly darkness , but now you are light in the Lord . Live like children of light
LEB	Ephesians	5	9	( for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ) ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	10	trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord .
LEB	Ephesians	5	11	And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness , but rather even expose them .
LEB	Ephesians	5	12	For it is shameful even to speak about the things being done by them in secret ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	13	but all things exposed by the light are made visible ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	14	for everything made visible is light . Therefore it says , Wake up , sleeper , and rise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you . [ d ]
LEB	Ephesians	5	15	Therefore , consider carefully how you live , not as unwise but as wise ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	16	making the most of the time because the days are evil . Being Filled by the Spirit
LEB	Ephesians	5	17	Because of this do not become foolish , but understand what the will of the Lord is .
LEB	Ephesians	5	18	And do not be drunk with wine ( in which is dissipation ) , but be filled by the Spirit ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	19	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	21	being subject to one another out of reverence for [ e ] Christ
LEB	Ephesians	5	22	—wives to their own husbands as to the Lord ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	23	because the husband is the head of the wife , as also Christ is the head of the church ( he himself being the Savior of the body ) .
LEB	Ephesians	5	24	But as the church is subject to Christ , thus also wives should be subject [ f ] to their husbands in everything . Husbands and Wives
LEB	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for her ;
LEB	Ephesians	5	26	in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing her [ g ] with the washing of water by the word ;
LEB	Ephesians	5	27	in order that he might present to himself the church glorious , not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing , but that she may be holy and blameless .
LEB	Ephesians	5	28	Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . The one who loves his own wife loves himself .
LEB	Ephesians	5	29	For no one ever hated his own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , just as also Christ does the church ,
LEB	Ephesians	5	30	because we are members of his body .
LEB	Ephesians	5	31	“ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two will become one flesh. ” [ h ]
LEB	Ephesians	5	32	( This mystery is great , but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church . )
LEB	Ephesians	5	33	Only you also , each one of you , must thus love his own wife as himself , and the wife must respect [ i ] her husband .

LEB	Ephesians	6	3	“ in order that it may be well with you , and you may live a long time [ b ] on the earth. ” [ c ]
LEB	Ephesians	6	4	And fathers , do not make your children angry , but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord . Slaves and Masters
LEB	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling , in the sincerity of your heart , as to Christ ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	7	serving with goodwill as to the Lord and not to people ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	8	because you [ e ] know that each one of you , whatever good he should do , [ f ] this he will receive back from the Lord , whether slave or free .
LEB	Ephesians	6	9	And masters , do the same things to them , giving up threats , knowing that both their Lord and yours is in heaven , and there is no partiality with him . Spiritual Warfare
LEB	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , become strong in the Lord and in the might of his strength .
LEB	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the full armor of God , so that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	12	because our struggle is not against blood and flesh , but against the rulers , against the authorities , against the world rulers of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places .
LEB	Ephesians	6	13	Because of this , take up the full armor of God , in order that you may be able to resist in the evil day , and having done everything , to stand .
LEB	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , girding your waist with truth , and putting on the breastplate of righteousness ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	15	and binding shoes under your feet with the preparation of the good news of peace ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	16	in everything taking up the shield of faith , with which you are able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	17	and receive the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	18	with all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the Spirit , and to this end being alert with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	19	and for me , that a word may be given to me at the opening of my mouth , to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	20	for the sake of which I am an ambassador in chains , that in them [ g ] I may speak freely , as it is necessary for me to speak . Conclusion and Benediction
LEB	Ephesians	6	21	Now , so that you also may know my circumstances [ h ] , what I am doing , Tychicus , my dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ,
LEB	Ephesians	6	22	whom I have sent [ i ] to you for this very reason , that you may know our circumstances [ j ] , and he may encourage your hearts .

LEB	Philippians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . Thanksgiving
LEB	Philippians	1	3	I give thanks to my God upon my every remembrance of you , [ a ]
LEB	Philippians	1	4	always in my every prayer for all of you , making the prayer with joy ,
LEB	Philippians	1	5	because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now ,
LEB	Philippians	1	6	convinced of this same thing , that the one who began a good work in you will finish it [ b ] until the day of Christ Jesus ,
LEB	Philippians	1	7	just as it is right for me to think this about all of you , because I have you in my heart , since [ c ] both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you are sharers of grace with me .
LEB	Philippians	1	8	For God is my witness , that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus . Prayer for Spiritual Maturity
LEB	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray : that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment ,
LEB	Philippians	1	10	so that you may approve what is superior , in order that you may be sincere and blameless in [ d ] the day of Christ ,
LEB	Philippians	1	11	having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God . The Progress of the Gospel
LEB	Philippians	1	12	Now I want you to know , brothers , that my circumstances [ e ] have happened instead for the progress of the gospel ,
LEB	Philippians	1	13	so that my imprisonment in Christ has become known in the whole praetorium [ f ] and to all the rest ,
LEB	Philippians	1	14	and most of the brothers , trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment , dare even more to speak the word without fear .
LEB	Philippians	1	15	Some even because of envy and strife preach Christ , but some also because of good will .
LEB	Philippians	1	16	The latter do so from love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel .
LEB	Philippians	1	17	The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition , not sincerely , thinking to raise up affliction in my imprisonment .
LEB	Philippians	1	18	What is the result ? [ g ] Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed , and in this I rejoice . But also I will rejoice ,
LEB	Philippians	1	19	for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
LEB	Philippians	1	20	according to my eager expectation and hope , that I will be put to shame in nothing , but with all boldness , even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body , whether through life or through death .
LEB	Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain .
LEB	Philippians	1	22	But if it is to live in the flesh , this is fruitful work for me , and which I will prefer I do not know .
LEB	Philippians	1	23	But I am hard pressed between the two options [ h ] , having the desire to depart and to be with Christ , for this is very much better [ i ] .
LEB	Philippians	1	24	But to stay on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake .
LEB	Philippians	1	25	And because I am [ j ] convinced of this , I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith ,
LEB	Philippians	1	26	so that what you can be proud of may increase in Christ Jesus because of me through my return again to you . Stand Firm for the Gospel
LEB	Philippians	1	27	Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ , so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear your circumstances [ k ] , that you are standing firm in one spirit , with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel ,
LEB	Philippians	1	28	and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents , which is a sign of destruction to them , but of your salvation , and this from God ,
LEB	Philippians	1	29	because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him , but also to suffer on behalf of him ,

LEB	Philippians	2	2	complete my joy , so that you are in agreement [ a ] , having the same love , united in spirit , having one purpose [ b ] .
LEB	Philippians	2	3	Do nothing according to selfish ambition or according to empty conceit , but in humility considering one another better than yourselves ,
LEB	Philippians	2	4	each of you [ c ] not looking out for your own interests [ d ] , but also each of you for the interests [ e ] of others . Christ ’ s Humiliation and Exaltation
LEB	Philippians	2	5	Think this in [ f ] yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus ,
LEB	Philippians	2	6	who , existing in the form of God , did not consider being equal with God something to be grasped ,
LEB	Philippians	2	7	but emptied himself by [ g ] taking the form of a slave , by [ h ] becoming in the likeness of people . And being found in appearance like a man ,
LEB	Philippians	2	8	he humbled himself by [ i ] becoming obedient to the point of death , that is , death on a cross .
LEB	Philippians	2	9	Therefore also God exalted him and graciously granted him the name above every name ,
LEB	Philippians	2	10	so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of those in heaven and of those on earth and of those under the earth ,
LEB	Philippians	2	11	and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father . Holding Fast to the Word of Life
LEB	Philippians	2	12	Therefore my dear friends , just as you have always obeyed , not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
LEB	Philippians	2	13	For the one at work in you , both to will and to work for his good pleasure , is God .
LEB	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without grumbling and disputing ,
LEB	Philippians	2	15	in order that you may become blameless and innocent , children of God without fault [ j ] in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation , among whom you shine as stars in the world , [ k ]
LEB	Philippians	2	16	holding fast to the word of life , for a source of pride [ l ] to me in the day of Christ , that I did not run in vain or labor in vain .
LEB	Philippians	2	17	But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice and rejoice with all of you .
LEB	Philippians	2	18	And in the same way also you rejoice and rejoice with me . Timothy ’ s Proven Character
LEB	Philippians	2	19	But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , so that I also may be encouraged when I [ m ] know your circumstances [ n ] .
LEB	Philippians	2	20	For I have no one like-minded who will sincerely be concerned about your circumstances [ o ] .
LEB	Philippians	2	21	For they all seek their own interests [ p ] , not those of Jesus Christ .
LEB	Philippians	2	22	But you know his proven character , that like a child with a father he served with me for the gospel .
LEB	Philippians	2	23	Therefore I hope to send him at once , as soon as I see my circumstances [ q ] .
LEB	Philippians	2	24	And I am convinced in the Lord that I myself will arrive shortly also . Epaphroditus ’ Mission
LEB	Philippians	2	25	But I considered it [ r ] necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier , but your messenger and servant of my need ,
LEB	Philippians	2	26	because he was longing for all of you and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick .
LEB	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick , coming near to death , but God had mercy on him and not on him only , but also on me , so that I would not have grief upon grief .
LEB	Philippians	2	28	Therefore I am sending him with special urgency , in order that when [ s ] you see him again you may rejoice , and I may be less anxious .
LEB	Philippians	2	29	Therefore welcome him in the Lord with all joy , and consider such people highly honored ,
LEB	Philippians	2	30	because on account of the work of Christ he came near to the point of death , risking his life in order that he might make up for your inability to serve me [ t ] .

LEB	Philippians	3	6	according to zeal persecuting the church , according to the righteousness in the law being blameless .
LEB	Philippians	3	7	But whatever things were gain to me , these things I have considered loss because of Christ .
LEB	Philippians	3	8	More than that [ e ] , I even consider all things to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord , for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and consider them [ f ] dung , in order that I may gain Christ

LEB	Philippians	3	10	so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings , being conformed to his death ,
LEB	Philippians	3	11	if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead .
LEB	Philippians	3	12	Not that I have already received this , [ i ] or have already been made perfect , but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ . [ j ]
LEB	Philippians	3	13	Brothers , I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it . [ k ] But I do one thing , forgetting the things behind and straining toward the things ahead ,
LEB	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus . Imitate Paul
LEB	Philippians	3	15	Therefore as many as are perfect , let us hold this opinion [ l ] , and if you think anything differently , God will reveal this also to you .
LEB	Philippians	3	16	Only to what we have attained , to the same hold on .
LEB	Philippians	3	17	Become fellow imitators of me , brothers , and observe those who walk in this way , just as you have us as an example .
LEB	Philippians	3	18	For many live , of whom I spoke about to you many times , but now speak about even weeping , as the enemies of the cross of Christ ,
LEB	Philippians	3	19	whose end is destruction , whose God is the stomach , and whose glory is in their shame , the ones who think on earthly things .
LEB	Philippians	3	20	For our commonwealth exists in heaven , from which also we eagerly await a savior , the Lord Jesus Christ ,
LEB	Philippians	3	21	who will transform our humble body to be conformed to his glorious body , in accordance with the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself .

LEB	Philippians	4	13	I am able to do all things by the one who strengthens me .
LEB	Philippians	4	14	Nevertheless you have done well by sharing [ g ] with me in my affliction .
LEB	Philippians	4	15	Now you also know , Philippians , that at the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone ,
LEB	Philippians	4	16	because even in Thessalonica on more than one occasion [ h ] you sent for my need .
LEB	Philippians	4	17	Not that I seek the gift , but I seek for the profit that increases to your account .
LEB	Philippians	4	18	But I have received everything in full and have an abundance ; I am well supplied [ i ] because [ j ] I received from Epaphroditus what you had sent [ k ] , a fragrant offering , an acceptable sacrifice , well-pleasing to God .

LEB	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , who is your life , is revealed , then you also will be revealed with him in glory . Put Off the Old Behavior
LEB	Colossians	3	5	Therefore put to death what is earthly in you [ a ] : sexual immorality , uncleanness , lustful passion , evil desire , and greediness , which is idolatry ,
LEB	Colossians	3	6	because of which the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience ,

LEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	knowing , brothers dearly loved by God , that he has chosen you [ b ] ,
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	because our gospel did not come to you with word only , but also with power and with the Holy Spirit and with much certainty , just as you know what sort of people we became among you for your sake .
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And you became imitators of us and of the Lord , receiving the word in much affliction , with the joy of the Holy Spirit ,
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	so that you became an example to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia ,
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	for from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , [ c ] but in every place your faith toward God has gone out , so that we have no need to say anything .
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves report about us , what sort of welcome we had with you , and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ,

LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians 2:18 Literally “ both once and twice ”
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi , just as you know , we had the courage in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition .
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation is not from error or from impurity or with deceit ,
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel , thus we speak , not as pleasing people but God , who examines our hearts .
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For never [ a ] did we come with a word of flattery , just as you know , nor with a pretext of greediness ( God is witness ) ,
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	nor seeking glory from people , neither from you nor from others .
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	Although we could have insisted on our own importance [ b ] [ c ] as apostles of Christ , yet we became infants in your midst , like a nursing mother cherishes her own children .

LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	exhorting and consoling you and insisting that you live in a manner worthy of God , who calls you to his own kingdom and glory . The Thessalonians ’ Response to Paul ’ s Message
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	And because of this we also give thanks to God constantly , that when you [ d ] received God ’ s word that you heard [ e ] from us , you accepted it not as the word of men , but as it truly is , the word of God , which also is at work in you who believe .
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For you became imitators , brothers , of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus , because you also suffered the same things at the hands of your own people , just as they themselves did also at the hands of the Jews ,
LEB	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets , and who persecuted us , and who are not pleasing to God and are opposed to all people ,

LEB	1%20Timothy	5	6	But the one who lives for sensual pleasure is dead even though she [ a ] lives .
LEB	1%20Timothy	5	7	And command these things , in order that they may be irreproachable .
LEB	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if someone does not provide for his own relatives , and especially the members of his household , he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever .
LEB	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let a widow be put on the list if she [ b ] is not less than sixty years old , the wife of one husband ,
LEB	1%20Timothy	5	10	being well-attested by good works , if she has brought up children , if she has shown hospitality , if she has washed the feet of the saints , if she has helped those who are oppressed , if she has devoted herself to every good work .

LEB	Hebrews	1	3	who is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence , sustaining all things by the word of power . [ d ] When he [ e ] had made purification for sins through him , he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high ,
LEB	Hebrews	1	4	having become by so much better than the angels , by as much as he has inherited a more excellent name than theirs . The Son Superior to the Angels
LEB	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did he ever say , “ You are my son , today I have begotten you , ” [ f ] and again ,
LEB	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when he brings the firstborn into the world , he says , “ And let all the angels of God worship him. ” [ j ]
LEB	Hebrews	1	7	And concerning the angels he says , “ The one who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire , ” [ k ]

LEB	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken through angels was binding and every transgression and act of disobedience received a just penalty ,
LEB	Hebrews	2	3	how will we escape if we [ a ] neglect so great a salvation which had its beginning when it [ b ] was spoken through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard ,
LEB	Hebrews	2	4	while [ c ] God was testifying at the same time by signs and wonders and various miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit according to his will . The Son ’ s Humiliation and Suffering
LEB	Hebrews	2	5	For he did not subject to angels the world to come , about which we are speaking .
LEB	Hebrews	2	6	But someone testified somewhere , saying , “ What is man , that you remember him , or the son of man , that you care for him ?

LEB	Hebrews	2	8	you subjected all things under his feet . [ e ] For in subjecting all things , [ f ] he left nothing that was not subject to him . But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him ,
LEB	Hebrews	2	9	but we see Jesus , for a short time made lower than the angels , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , so that apart from God [ g ] he might taste death on behalf of everyone .
LEB	Hebrews	2	10	For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings .
LEB	Hebrews	2	11	For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one , for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
LEB	Hebrews	2	12	saying , “ I will proclaim your name to my brothers ; in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you. ” [ h ]
LEB	Hebrews	2	13	And again , “ I will trust in him. ” [ i ] And again , “ Behold , I and the children God has given me. ” [ j ]
LEB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore , since the children share in blood and flesh , he also in like manner shared in these same things , in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death , that is , the devil ,
LEB	Hebrews	2	15	and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives .
LEB	Hebrews	2	16	For surely he is not concerned with angels , but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham .
LEB	Hebrews	2	17	Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects , in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God , in order to make atonement for the sins of the people .
LEB	Hebrews	2	18	For in that which he himself suffered when he [ k ] was tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .

LEB	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but the one who built all things is God .
LEB	Hebrews	3	5	And Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony to the things that would be spoken ,
LEB	Hebrews	3	6	but Christ was faithful [ b ] as a son over his house , whose house we are , if [ c ] we hold fast to our confidence and the hope we can be proud of . A Serious Warning Against Unbelief
LEB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore , just as the Holy Spirit says , “ Today , if you hear his voice ,
LEB	Hebrews	3	8	do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion , in the day of testing in the wilderness ,
LEB	Hebrews	3	9	where your fathers tested me by trial and saw my works
LEB	Hebrews	3	10	for forty years . Therefore I was angry with this generation , and I said , ‘ They always go astray in their heart , and they do not know my ways. ’
LEB	Hebrews	3	11	As I swore in my anger , ‘ They will never enter [ d ] into my rest. ’ ” [ e ]
LEB	Hebrews	3	12	Watch out , brothers , lest there be in some of you an evil , unbelieving heart , with the result that you fall away [ f ] from the living God .
LEB	Hebrews	3	13	But encourage one another day by day [ g ] , as long as it is called “ today , ” so that none of you become hardened [ h ] by the deception of sin .
LEB	Hebrews	3	14	For we have become partners of Christ , if indeed we hold fast the beginning of our commitment steadfast until the end ,
LEB	Hebrews	3	15	while it is said [ i ] , “ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion. ” [ j ]
LEB	Hebrews	3	16	For who , when they [ k ] heard it , were disobedient ? Surely it was not all who went out from Egypt through Moses ?
LEB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he angry for forty years ? Was it not with those who sinned , whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness ?
LEB	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest , except those who were disobedient ?
LEB	Hebrews	3	19	And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief . Footnotes - Hebrews 3:2 Some manuscripts have “ in all his household ” - Hebrews 3:6 The words “ was faithful ” are not in the Greek text , but are an understood repetition from the previous verse and v.

LEB	Hebrews	4	4	For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way : “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works , ” [ h ]
LEB	Hebrews	4	2	For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us [ b ] , just as those also did , but the message they heard [ c ] did not benefit them , because they [ d ] were not united with those who heard it in faith .
LEB	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have believed enter into rest , [ e ] just as he has said , And yet these works have been accomplished from the foundation of the world .
LEB	Hebrews	4	5	and in this passage again , ‘ They will never enter [ i ] into my rest. ’ ” [ j ]
LEB	Hebrews	4	6	Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it , and the ones to whom the good news was proclaimed previously did not enter because of disobedience ,
LEB	Hebrews	4	7	again he ordains a certain day , today , speaking by David after so long a time , just as had been said before , “ Today , if you hear his voice , do not harden your hearts. ” [ k ]
LEB	Hebrews	4	8	For if Joshua had caused them to rest , he would not have spoken about another day after these things .
LEB	Hebrews	4	9	Consequently a sabbath rest remains for the people of God .
LEB	Hebrews	4	10	For the one who has entered into his rest has also himself rested from his works , just as God did from his own works .
LEB	Hebrews	4	11	Therefore , let us make every effort to enter into that rest , in order that no one may fall in the same pattern of disobedience .
LEB	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword , and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit , both joints and marrow , and able to judge the reflections and thoughts of the heart .
LEB	Hebrews	4	13	And no creature is hidden in the sight of him , but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom we must give our account [ l ] . Jesus Our Great High Priest

LEB	Hebrews	5	5	Thus also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest , but the one who said to him , “ You are my Son , today I have begotten you , ” [ b ]
LEB	Hebrews	5	2	being able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and led astray , since he himself also is surrounded by weakness ,
LEB	Hebrews	5	3	and because of it he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins for himself also , as well as for the people [ a ] .
LEB	Hebrews	5	4	And someone does not take for himself the honor , but is called by God , just as Aaron also was .
LEB	Hebrews	5	6	just as also in another place he says ,
LEB	Hebrews	5	7	who in the days of his flesh offered up both prayers and supplications , with loud crying and tears , to the one who was able to save him from death , and he was heard as a result of his reverence .
LEB	Hebrews	5	8	Although he was a son , he learned obedience from what he suffered ,
LEB	Hebrews	5	9	and being perfected , he became the source of eternal salvation to all those who obey him ,
LEB	Hebrews	5	10	being designated by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek . Advanced Teaching Hindered by Immaturity
LEB	Hebrews	5	11	Concerning this [ e ] we have much to say and it is difficult to explain [ f ] , since you have become sluggish in hearing .
LEB	Hebrews	5	12	For indeed , although you [ g ] ought to be teachers by this time [ h ] , you have need of someone to teach you again the beginning elements of the oracles of God , and you have need of [ i ] milk , not [ j ] solid food .
LEB	Hebrews	5	13	For everyone who partakes of milk is unacquainted with the message of righteousness , because he is an infant .
LEB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for the mature , who because of practice have trained their faculties for the distinguishing of both good and evil .

LEB	Hebrews	6	2	teaching about baptisms and laying on of hands , and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment .
LEB	Hebrews	6	3	And this we will do , if God permits .
LEB	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible concerning those who have once been enlightened , and have tasted the heavenly gift , and become sharers of the Holy Spirit ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	5	and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	7	For ground that drinks the rain that comes often upon it , and brings forth vegetation usable to those people for whose sake [ b ] it is also cultivated , shares a blessing from God .
LEB	Hebrews	6	8	But if it [ c ] produces thorns and thistles , it is worthless and near to a curse , whose end is for burning .
LEB	Hebrews	6	9	But even if we are speaking in this way , dear friends , we are convinced of better things concerning you , and belonging to salvation .
LEB	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unjust , so as to forget your work and the love which you demonstrated for his name by [ d ] having served the saints , and continuing to serve them .
LEB	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire each one of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	12	in order that you may not be sluggish , but imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and patience . The Reliability of God ’ s Promise
LEB	Hebrews	6	13	For when [ e ] God made a promise to Abraham , since he had no one greater to swear by , he swore by himself ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	14	saying ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	15	And so , by [ h ] persevering , he obtained the promise .
LEB	Hebrews	6	16	For people swear by what is greater than themselves , and the oath for confirmation is the end of all dispute for them .
LEB	Hebrews	6	17	In the same way God , because he [ i ] wanted to show even more to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his resolve , guaranteed it with an oath ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	18	in order that through two unchangeable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have taken refuge may have powerful encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us ,
LEB	Hebrews	6	19	which we have like an anchor of the soul , both firm and steadfast , and entering into the inside of the curtain ,

LEB	Hebrews	7	7	Now without any dispute the inferior is blessed by the more prominent .
LEB	Hebrews	7	2	to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything [ c ] —in the first place , his name is translated “ king of righteousness , ” and then also “ king of Salem , ” that is , “ king of peace ” ;
LEB	Hebrews	7	3	without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but resembling the Son of God—he remains a priest for all time .
LEB	Hebrews	7	4	But see how great this man was , to whom Abraham [ d ] the patriarch gave a tenth from the spoils !
LEB	Hebrews	7	5	And indeed those of the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment to collect a tenth from the people according to the law , that is , from their brothers , although they are descended from Abraham [ e ] .
LEB	Hebrews	7	6	But the one who did not trace his descent from them collected tithes from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises .
LEB	Hebrews	7	8	And in this case mortal men receive tithes , but in that case it is testified that he lives .
LEB	Hebrews	7	9	And , so to speak [ f ] , even Levi , the one who receives tithes , has paid tithes through Abraham .
LEB	Hebrews	7	10	For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him . The Superiority of Jesus to Melchizedek
LEB	Hebrews	7	11	Thus if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood , for on the basis of it the people received the law , what further need is there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the order of Aaron ?
LEB	Hebrews	7	12	For when [ g ] the priesthood changes , of necessity there is a change of the law also .
LEB	Hebrews	7	13	For the one about whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe from which no one has officiated at the altar .
LEB	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord is a descendant of Judah , a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests .
LEB	Hebrews	7	15	And it is still more clear , if another priest according to the likeness of Melchizedek arises ,
LEB	Hebrews	7	16	who has become a priest not according to a law of physical requirement , but according to the power of an indestructible life .
LEB	Hebrews	7	17	For it is testified ,
LEB	Hebrews	7	18	For on the one hand a preceding commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
LEB	Hebrews	7	19	( for the law made nothing perfect ) , but on the other hand there is the introduction of a better hope through which we draw near to God .
LEB	Hebrews	7	20	And by as much as this was not without an oath ( for these on the one hand have become priests [ j ] without an oath ,
LEB	Hebrews	7	21	but he with an oath by the one who said to him ,
LEB	Hebrews	7	22	by so much more [ m ] Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant .
LEB	Hebrews	7	23	And indeed many have become [ n ] priests , because they were prevented by death from continuing in office ,
LEB	Hebrews	7	24	but he , because he continues forever [ o ] , holds the priesthood permanently .
LEB	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore also he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him , because he [ p ] always lives in order to intercede on their behalf .
LEB	Hebrews	7	26	For a high priest such as this indeed is fitting for us , holy , innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners , and having become exalted above the heavens ,
LEB	Hebrews	7	27	who does not need every day [ q ] like the former high priests to offer up sacrifices for his own sins and then for the sins of the people , because he did this once for all when he [ r ] offered up himself .
LEB	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness , but the statement of the oath , after the law , appoints a Son , who is made perfect forever [ s ] .

LEB	Hebrews	8	2	a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up , not man .
LEB	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is appointed in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices ; therefore it was [ a ] necessary for this one also to have something that he offers .
LEB	Hebrews	8	4	Now if he were on earth , he would not even be a priest , because there [ b ] are those who offer the gifts according to the law ,
LEB	Hebrews	8	5	who serve a sketch and shadow of the heavenly things , just as Moses was warned when he [ c ] was about to complete the tabernacle , for he says , “ See to it that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain. ” [ d ]
LEB	Hebrews	8	6	But now he has attained a more excellent ministry , by as much as he is also mediator of a better covenant which has been enacted upon better promises .
LEB	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , occasion would not have been sought for a second .
LEB	Hebrews	8	9	not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day I took hold of them by my hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt , because they did not continue in my covenant and I disregarded them , says the Lord .

LEB	Hebrews	9	9	which was a symbol for the present time , in which both the gifts and sacrifices which were offered were not able to perfect the worshiper with respect to the conscience ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	2	For a tent was prepared , the first one , in which were the lampstand and the table and the presentation of the loaves , which is called the holy place .
LEB	Hebrews	9	3	And after the second curtain was a tent called the holy of holies ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	4	containing the golden incense altar and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold , in which were a golden jar containing the manna and the rod of Aaron that budded and the tablets of the covenant .
LEB	Hebrews	9	5	And above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat , about which it is not now possible to speak in detail .
LEB	Hebrews	9	6	Now these things having been prepared in this way , the priests enter into the first tent continually [ b ] as they [ c ] accomplish their service ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	7	but only the high priest enters into the second tent once a year , not without blood , which he offers on behalf of himself and the sins of the people committed in ignorance .
LEB	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Spirit was making this clear , that the way into the holy place was not yet revealed , while [ d ] the first tent was still in existence ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	10	concerning instead only food and drink and different washings , regulations of outward things imposed until the time of setting things right . The Heavenly Ministry of the New Covenant
LEB	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ has arrived as a high priest of the good things to come . Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands , that is , not of this creation ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	12	and not by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood , he entered once for all into the most holy place , obtaining eternal redemption .
LEB	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God ?
LEB	Hebrews	9	15	And because of this , he is the mediator of a new covenant , in order that , because [ e ] a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant , those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
LEB	Hebrews	9	16	For where there is a will , it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established .
LEB	Hebrews	9	17	For a will is in force concerning those who are dead , since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive .
LEB	Hebrews	9	18	Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood .
LEB	Hebrews	9	19	For when [ f ] every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves [ g ] with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you. ” [ h ]
LEB	Hebrews	9	21	And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood .
LEB	Hebrews	9	22	Indeed , nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law , and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
LEB	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices , but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these .
LEB	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands , a mere copy of the true one , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	25	and not in order that he can offer himself many times , as the high priest enters into the sanctuary year by year [ i ] with blood not his own ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	26	since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world , but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself .
LEB	Hebrews	9	27	And just as [ j ] it is destined for people to die once , and after this , judgment ,
LEB	Hebrews	9	28	thus also Christ , having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many , will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation .

LEB	Hebrews	10	10	by which will we are made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
LEB	Hebrews	10	2	For otherwise , would they not have ceased to be offered , because the ones who worship , having been purified once and for all , would no longer have any consciousness of sins ?
LEB	Hebrews	10	3	But in them there is a reminder of sins year by year [ b ] .
LEB	Hebrews	10	4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .
LEB	Hebrews	10	5	Therefore , when he [ c ] came into the world , he said , “ Sacrifice and offering you did not want , but a body you prepared for me ;
LEB	Hebrews	10	6	you did not delight in whole burnt offerings and offerings for sins .
LEB	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ Behold , I have come— in the roll of the book it is written about me— to do your will , O God. ’
LEB	Hebrews	10	8	When he says above , “ Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and offerings for sin you did not want , nor did you delight in , ” [ d ] which are offered according to the law ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	9	then he has said , “ Behold , I have come to do your will. ” [ e ] He takes away the first in order to establish the second ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest stands every day serving and offering the same sacrifices many times , which are never able to take away sins .
LEB	Hebrews	10	12	But this one , after he [ f ] had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time , sat down at the right hand of God ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	13	from now on waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet .
LEB	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy .
LEB	Hebrews	10	15	And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us , for after saying ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the covenant that I will decree for them after those days , says the Lord : I am putting my laws on their hearts , and I will write them on their minds. ” [ g ]
LEB	Hebrews	10	17	He also says , “ Their sins and their lawless deeds I will never remember again. ” [ h ]
LEB	Hebrews	10	18	Now where there is forgiveness of these , there is no longer an offering for sin . Hold Fast the Confession of Our Hope

LEB	Hebrews	10	20	by the new and living way which he inaugurated for us through the curtain , that is , his flesh ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	21	and since we have [ j ] a great priest over the house of God ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	22	let us approach with a true heart in the full assurance of faith , our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water .
LEB	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering , for the one who promised is faithful .
LEB	Hebrews	10	24	And let us think about how to stir one another up to love [ k ] and good works ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	25	not abandoning our meeting together [ l ] , as is the habit of some , but encouraging each other , and by so much more as you see the day drawing near . A Serious Warning Against Continuing Deliberate Sin
LEB	Hebrews	10	26	For if [ m ] we keep on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth , there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	27	but a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that is about to consume the adversaries .
LEB	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
LEB	Hebrews	10	29	How much worse punishment do you think the person will be considered worthy of who treats with disdain the Son of God and who considers ordinary the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy and who insults the Spirit of grace ?
LEB	Hebrews	10	30	For we know the one who said , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , ” [ n ] and again , “ The Lord will judge his people. ” [ o ]
LEB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
LEB	Hebrews	10	32	But remember the former days in which , after you [ p ] were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ,
LEB	Hebrews	10	33	sometimes being publicly exposed both to insults and to afflictions , and sometimes becoming sharers with those who were treated in this way .
LEB	Hebrews	10	34	For you both sympathized with the prisoners and put up with the seizure of your belongings with joy because you [ q ] knew that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession .
LEB	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore do not throw away your confidence , which has great reward .
LEB	Hebrews	10	36	For you have need of endurance , in order that after you [ r ] have done the will of God , you may receive what was promised .
LEB	Hebrews	10	37	For yet “ a very , very little while , and the one who is coming will come and will not delay .
LEB	Hebrews	10	38	But my righteous one will live by faith , and if he shrinks back , my soul is not well pleased with him. ” [ s ]
LEB	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not among those who shrink back to destruction , but among those who have faith to the preservation of our souls .

LEB	Hebrews	11	11	By faith also , with Sarah [ f ] , [ g ] he received the ability to procreate [ h ] even past the normal age [ i ] , because he regarded the one who had promised to be faithful .
LEB	Hebrews	11	2	For by this the people of old were approved .
LEB	Hebrews	11	3	By faith we understand the worlds were created by the word of God , in order that what is seen did not come into existence from what is visible .
LEB	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered to God a greater sacrifice than Cain , by which he was approved that he was righteous , because [ a ] God approved him for his gifts , and through it [ b ] he still speaks , although he [ c ] is dead .
LEB	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was taken up , so that he did not experience death , and he was not found , because God took him up . For before his removal , he had been approved as having been pleasing [ d ] to God .
LEB	Hebrews	11	6	Now without faith it is impossible to please him , for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him .
LEB	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , having been warned about things not yet seen , out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family , by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith .
LEB	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , when he [ e ] was called , obeyed to go out to a place that he was going to receive for an inheritance , and he went out , not knowing where he was going .
LEB	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger , living in tents with Isaac and Jacob , the fellow heirs of the same promise .
LEB	Hebrews	11	10	For he was expecting the city that has foundations , whose architect and builder is God .
LEB	Hebrews	11	12	And therefore these were fathered from one man , and he being as good as dead , as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea .
LEB	Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith without receiving the promises , but seeing them from a distance and welcoming them , and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth .
LEB	Hebrews	11	14	For those who say such things make clear that they are seeking a homeland .
LEB	Hebrews	11	15	And if they remember [ j ] that land from which they went out , they would have had opportunity to return .
LEB	Hebrews	11	16	But now they aspire to a better land , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for he has prepared for them a city .
LEB	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when he was tested , offered Isaac , and the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son ,
LEB	Hebrews	11	18	with reference to whom it was said , “ In Isaac your descendants will be named , ” [ k ]
LEB	Hebrews	11	19	having reasoned that God was able even to raise him from the dead , from which he received him back also as a symbol .

LEB	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , as he [ m ] was dying , mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones .

LEB	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he [ o ] was grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ,
LEB	Hebrews	11	25	choosing instead to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to experience the transitory enjoyment of sin ,
LEB	Hebrews	11	26	considering reproach endured for the sake of Christ [ p ] greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt , for he was looking to the reward .
LEB	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the anger of the king , for he persevered as if he [ q ] saw the invisible one .
LEB	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood , in order that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them .
LEB	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land ; the Egyptians , when they made the attempt [ r ] , were drowned .
LEB	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they [ s ] had been marched around for seven days .
LEB	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient , because she [ t ] welcomed the spies in peace .
LEB	Hebrews	11	32	And what more shall I say ? For time would fail me to tell about Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , and Samuel and the prophets ,
LEB	Hebrews	11	33	who through faith conquered kingdoms , accomplished justice , obtained what was promised , shut the mouths of lions ,
LEB	Hebrews	11	34	extinguished the effectiveness of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , were made strong from weakness , became mighty in battle , put to flight enemy battle lines .
LEB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received back their dead by resurrection . But others were tortured , not accepting release , in order that they might gain a better resurrection .
LEB	Hebrews	11	36	And others experienced mocking and flogging [ u ] , and in addition bonds and imprisonment .
LEB	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , they were sawed in two , they died by murder with a sword , they wandered about in sheepskins , in goatskins , impoverished , afflicted , mistreated ,
LEB	Hebrews	11	38	of whom the world was not worthy , wandering about on deserts and mountains and in caves and in holes in the ground .
LEB	Hebrews	11	39	And although they [ v ] all were approved [ w ] through their faith , they did not receive what was promised ,

LEB	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore strengthen your slackened hands and your weakened knees ,
LEB	Hebrews	12	2	fixing our eyes on Jesus , the originator and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , disregarding the shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God .
LEB	Hebrews	12	3	For consider the one who endured such hostility by sinners against himself , [ c ] so that you will not grow weary in your souls and give up .
LEB	Hebrews	12	4	You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your [ d ] blood as you [ e ] struggle against sin .
LEB	Hebrews	12	5	And have you completely forgotten the exhortation which instructs you as sons ? “ My son , do not make light of the Lord ’ s discipline , or give up when you are corrected by him .
LEB	Hebrews	12	6	For the Lord disciplines the one whom he loves , and punishes every son whom he accepts. ” [ f ]
LEB	Hebrews	12	7	Endure it for discipline . God is dealing with you as sons . For what son is there whom a father does not discipline ?
LEB	Hebrews	12	8	But if you are without discipline , in which all legitimate sons [ g ] have become participants , then you are illegitimate and not sons .
LEB	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore , we have had our earthly fathers [ h ] who disciplined us , and we respected them . Will we not much rather subject ourselves to the Father of spirits and live ?
LEB	Hebrews	12	10	For they disciplined us for a few days according to what seemed appropriate to them , but he does so for our benefit , in order that we can have a share in his holiness .
LEB	Hebrews	12	11	Now all discipline seems for the moment not to be joyful but painful , but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness for those who are trained by it . A Serious Warning Against Refusing God
LEB	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet , so that what is lame will not be dislocated , but rather be healed .
LEB	Hebrews	12	14	Pursue peace with everyone , and holiness , without which no one will see the Lord .
LEB	Hebrews	12	15	Take care that no one falls short of the grace of God ; that no one growing up like a root of bitterness causes trouble , and by it many become defiled ;
LEB	Hebrews	12	16	that no one be a sexually immoral or totally worldly person like Esau , who for one meal traded his own birthright .
LEB	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that also afterwards , when he [ i ] wanted to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , because he did not find an occasion for repentance , although he sought it with tears .
LEB	Hebrews	12	18	For you have not come to something that can be touched , and to a burning fire , and to darkness , and to gloom , and to a whirlwind ,
LEB	Hebrews	12	19	and to the noise of a trumpet , and to the sound of words which those who heard begged that not another word be spoken to them .
LEB	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not endure what was commanded : “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned. ” [ j ]
LEB	Hebrews	12	21	And the spectacle was so terrifying that Moses said , “ I am terrified and trembling. ” [ k ]
LEB	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , to the heavenly Jerusalem , and to tens of thousands of angels , to the festal gathering
LEB	Hebrews	12	23	and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , and to God the judge of all , and to the spirits of righteous people made perfect ,
LEB	Hebrews	12	24	and to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the sprinkled blood [ l ] that speaks better than Abel ’ s does .
LEB	Hebrews	12	25	Watch out that you do not refuse the one who is speaking ! For if those did not escape when they [ m ] refused the one who warned them on earth , much less will we escape , [ n ] if we [ o ] reject the one who warns from heaven ,
LEB	Hebrews	12	26	whose voice shook the earth at that time , but now he has promised , saying , “ Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven. ” [ p ]
LEB	Hebrews	12	27	Now the phrase “ yet once more ” indicates the removal of what is shaken , namely , things that have been created , in order that the things that are not shaken may remain .
LEB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we [ q ] are receiving an unshakable kingdom , let us be thankful , through which let us serve God acceptably , with awe and reverence .

LEB	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sins are burned up outside the camp .
LEB	Hebrews	13	12	Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate , in order that he might sanctify the people by his own blood .
LEB	Hebrews	13	14	For here we do not have a permanent city , but we seek the city that is to come .
LEB	Hebrews	13	15	Therefore through him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually [ h ] to God , that is , the fruit of lips that confess his name .
LEB	Hebrews	13	16	And do not neglect doing good and generosity , for God is pleased with such sacrifices .
LEB	Hebrews	13	17	Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account , so that they can do this with joy and not with groaning , for this would be unprofitable for you .
LEB	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us , for we are convinced that we have a good conscience , and want to conduct ourselves commendably in every way .

LEB	James	1	1	James , a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes in the dispersion . Greetings ! Trials , Testing , and Faith
LEB	James	1	2	Consider it all joy , my brothers , whenever you encounter various trials ,
LEB	James	1	3	because you [ a ] know that the testing of your faith produces endurance .
LEB	James	1	4	And let endurance have its perfect effect , so that you may be mature and complete , lacking in nothing .
LEB	James	1	5	Now if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask for it from God , who gives to all without reservation and not reproaching , and it will be given to him .
LEB	James	1	6	But let him ask for it in faith , without any doubting , for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed about .
LEB	James	1	7	For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ;
LEB	James	1	8	he is a double-minded man , unstable in all his ways .
LEB	James	1	9	Now let the brother of humble circumstances boast in his high position ,
LEB	James	1	10	but the rich person in his humiliation , because he will pass away like a flower of the grass .
LEB	James	1	11	For the sun rises with its burning heat and dries up the grass , and its flower falls off , and the beauty of its appearance is lost . So also the rich person in his pursuits [ b ] will wither away .
LEB	James	1	12	Blessed is the person [ c ] who endures testing , because when he [ d ] is approved he will receive the crown of life that he [ e ] has promised to those who love him .
LEB	James	1	13	No one who is being tempted should say , “ I am being tempted by God , ” for God can not be tempted [ f ] by evil , and he himself tempts no one .
LEB	James	1	14	But each one is tempted when he [ g ] is dragged away and enticed by his own desires .
LEB	James	1	15	Then desire , after it [ h ] has conceived , gives birth to sin , and sin , when it [ i ] is brought to completion , gives birth to death .
LEB	James	1	16	Do not be deceived , my dear brothers .
LEB	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom there is no variation or shadow of change .
LEB	James	1	18	By his [ j ] will he gave birth to us through the message of truth , so that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures . Doers of the Message , Not Just Hearers
LEB	James	1	19	Understand this , my dear brothers : every person must be quick to hear , slow to speak , slow to anger ,
LEB	James	1	20	for human [ k ] anger does not accomplish the righteousness of God .
LEB	James	1	21	Therefore , putting aside all moral uncleanness and wicked excess , welcome [ l ] with humility the implanted message which is able to save your souls .
LEB	James	1	22	But be doers of the message and not hearers only , [ m ] deceiving yourselves ,
LEB	James	1	23	because if anyone is a hearer of the message and not a doer , this one is like someone [ n ] staring at his own face [ o ] in a mirror ,
LEB	James	1	24	for he looks at himself and goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he was .
LEB	James	1	25	But the one who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues to do it , not being a forgetful hearer but a doer who acts , this one will be blessed in what he does [ p ] .
LEB	James	1	26	If anyone thinks he is religious , although he [ q ] does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart , this person ’ s religion is worthless .
LEB	James	1	27	Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our [ r ] God and Father is this : to look after orphans and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained by the world .

LEB	James	2	2	For if someone [ a ] enters into your assembly [ b ] in fine clothing with a gold ring on his finger , and a poor person in filthy clothing also enters ,
LEB	James	2	3	and you look favorably on the one wearing the fine clothing and you say , “ Be seated here in a good place , ” and to the poor person you say , “ You stand or be seated there [ c ] by my footstool , ”
LEB	James	2	4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts ?
LEB	James	2	5	Listen , my dear brothers ! Did not God choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him ?
LEB	James	2	6	But you have dishonored the poor ! Are not the rich exploiting you and they themselves dragging you into the courts ?
LEB	James	2	7	Do they themselves not blaspheme the good name of the one to whom you belong [ d ] ?
LEB	James	2	8	However , if you carry out the royal law according to the scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” [ e ] you are doing well .
LEB	James	2	9	But if you show partiality , you commit sin , and thus [ f ] are convicted by the law as transgressors .
LEB	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles in one point only has become guilty of all of it .
LEB	James	2	11	For the one who said “ Do not commit adultery ” [ g ] also said “ Do not murder. ” [ h ] Now if you do not commit adultery but you do murder , you have become a transgressor of the law .
LEB	James	2	12	Thus speak and thus act as those who are going to be judged by the law of liberty .
LEB	James	2	13	For judgment is merciless to the one who has not practiced mercy . Mercy triumphs over judgment . Faith and Works
LEB	James	2	14	What is the benefit , my brothers , if someone says that he has faith but does not have works ? That faith is not able to save him , is it ? [ i ]
LEB	James	2	15	If a brother or a sister is poorly clothed and lacking food for the day ,
LEB	James	2	16	and one of you should say to them , “ Go in peace , keep warm and eat well [ j ] , ” but does not give them what is necessary for the body , what is the benefit ?
LEB	James	2	17	Thus also faith , if it does not have works , is dead by itself .
LEB	James	2	18	, while others see it extending through v.

LEB	James	2	20	But do you want to know , O foolish person , that faith apart from works is useless ?
LEB	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he [ n ] offered up his son Isaac on the altar ?
LEB	James	2	22	You see that faith was working together with his works , and by the works the faith was perfected .
LEB	James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled that says , “ And Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him for righteousness , ” [ o ] and he was called God ’ s friend .
LEB	James	2	24	You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone .
LEB	James	2	25	And likewise was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she [ p ] welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different route ?
LEB	James	2	26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead , so also faith without works is dead .

LEB	James	3	3	And if we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they obey us , we also guide their whole bodies .
LEB	James	3	2	For we all stumble in many ways . If anyone does not stumble in what he says , he is a perfect individual , [ c ] able to hold in check his whole body also .
LEB	James	3	4	Behold also ships : although they are so large and are driven by strong winds , they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wishes .
LEB	James	3	5	So also the tongue is a small member of the body [ d ] and boasts great things . Behold how small a fire sets ablaze how great a forest !
LEB	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire ! The world of unrighteousness , [ e ] the tongue , is set among our members , defiling the whole body and setting on fire the course of human existence [ f ] , being set on fire by hell .
LEB	James	3	7	For every species of animals and birds , of reptiles and sea creatures , is being tamed and has been tamed by the human species ,
LEB	James	3	8	but no human being is able to tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
LEB	James	3	9	With it we bless the [ g ] Lord and Father , and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God .
LEB	James	3	10	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing . My brothers , these things ought not to be so !
LEB	James	3	11	A spring does not pour forth from the same opening fresh and bitter water , does it ? [ h ]
LEB	James	3	12	A fig tree is not able , my brothers , to produce olives , or a grapevine figs . Neither can a saltwater spring produce fresh water . The Wisdom That Comes Down from Above
LEB	James	3	13	Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let him show by his [ i ] good behavior his works , with the humility of wisdom .
LEB	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not boast and tell lies against the truth .
LEB	James	3	15	This is not the wisdom that comes down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
LEB	James	3	16	For where there is jealousy and selfish ambition , there is disorder and every evil practice .
LEB	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is first pure , then peaceful , gentle , obedient , full of mercy and good fruits , nonjudgmental , without hypocrisy ,
LEB	James	3	18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among [ j ] those who make peace .

LEB	James	4	4	Adulterous people ! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
LEB	James	4	2	You desire and do not have ; you murder and are filled with envy , and are not able to obtain ; you fight and quarrel . You do not have because you do not ask .
LEB	James	4	3	You ask and do not receive , because you ask with wrong motives , in order that you may spend it on your pleasures .
LEB	James	4	5	Or do you think that in vain the scripture says , “ The spirit which he caused to dwell in us desires jealously ” ? [ a ]
LEB	James	4	6	But he gives greater grace . Therefore it says , “ God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble. ” [ b ]
LEB	James	4	7	Therefore subject yourselves to God . But resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
LEB	James	4	8	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you double-minded !
LEB	James	4	9	Lament and mourn and weep ! Let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your [ c ] joy to gloominess .
LEB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will exalt you .
LEB	James	4	11	Do not speak evil of one another , brothers . The one who speaks evil of a brother or judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge of the law . [ d ]
LEB	James	4	12	There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy . But who are you to judge your [ e ] neighbor ? Arrogant Boasting About the Future
LEB	James	4	13	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there , and carry on business and make a profit , ”
LEB	James	4	14	you who do not know what will happen tomorrow [ f ] , what your life will be like [ g ] . For you are a smoky vapor that appears for a short time and then disappears .
LEB	James	4	15	Instead you should say , “ If the Lord wills , we will live and do this or that. ”
LEB	James	4	16	But now you boast in your arrogance . All such boasting is evil .
LEB	James	4	17	Therefore , to the one who knows to do good and does not do it , to him it is sin . Footnotes - James 4:5 This translation takes “ spirit ” to be the capacity within people that produces a divided mind and conflicts regarding God ; other translations take this to refer to the Holy Spirit : “ He ( God ) jealously desires the Spirit which he caused to dwell in us ” - James 4:6 A quotation from Prov 3:34 - James 4:9 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - James 4:11 The words “ of the law ” are not in the Greek text , but are an understood repetition from the previous clause - James 4:12 Literally “ the ” ; the Greek article is used here as a possessive pronoun - James 4:14 Literally “ the circumstance of tomorrow ” - James 4:14 Literally “ of what sort your life ”

LEB	James	5	5	You have lived self-indulgently on the earth [ a ] and have lived luxuriously . You have fattened your hearts in the day of slaughter .
LEB	James	5	2	Your wealth has rotted , and your clothing has become moth-eaten .
LEB	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have become corroded , and their corrosion will be a witness against you , and it will consume your flesh like fire . You have stored up treasure in the last days .
LEB	James	5	4	Behold , the wages that were held back by you from the workers who reap your fields cry out , and the cries of the reapers have come to the ears of the Lord of hosts .
LEB	James	5	6	You have condemned , you have murdered the righteous person ; he does not resist you . Exhortation to Patience
LEB	James	5	7	Therefore be patient , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . Behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the soil , being patient concerning it until it receives the early and late rains .
LEB	James	5	8	You also be patient . Strengthen your hearts , because the coming of the Lord is near .
LEB	James	5	9	Brothers , do not complain against one another , in order that you may not be judged . Behold , the judge stands before the doors !
LEB	James	5	10	Brothers , take as an example of perseverance and endurance the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
LEB	James	5	11	Behold , we consider blessed those who have endured . You have heard about the patient endurance of Job , and you saw the outcome from the Lord , that the Lord is compassionate and merciful .
LEB	James	5	12	Now above all , my brothers , do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath , but let your yes be yes and your no , no , in order that you may not fall under judgment . The Effective Prayer of Faith
LEB	James	5	13	Is anyone among you suffering misfortune ? He should pray . Is anyone cheerful ? He should sing praise .
LEB	James	5	14	Is anyone among you sick ? He should summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him , anointing him with olive oil in the name of the Lord .
LEB	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up , and if he has committed sins he will be forgiven [ b ] .
LEB	James	5	16	Therefore confess your sins to one another , and pray for one another , so that you may be healed . The effective prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much .
LEB	James	5	17	Elijah was a human being [ c ] with the same nature as us , and he prayed fervently [ d ] for it not to rain , and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months .
LEB	James	5	18	And he prayed again , and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit .
LEB	James	5	19	My brothers , if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and someone turns him back ,
LEB	James	5	20	he should know that the one who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that person ’ s [ e ] soul from death , and will cover over a great number of sins . Footnotes - James 5:5 Or “ land ” - James 5:15 Literally “ it will be forgiven him ” - James 5:17 Literally “ man , ” but in a generic sense ; the emphasis is not on Elijah ’ s masculine gender but his shared humanity - James 5:17 Literally “ he prayed with prayer ” - James 5:20 Literally “ his , ” but in context this refers to the sinner , not the person who turns the sinner back

LEB	1%20Peter	1	8	""
LEB	1%20Peter	1	9	obtaining the goal of your faith , the salvation of your [ f ] souls .
LEB	1%20Peter	1	10	Concerning this [ g ] salvation , the prophets who prophesied about the grace meant for you sought and made careful inquiry ,
LEB	1%20Peter	1	11	investigating for what person or which time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he [ h ] testified beforehand to the sufferings with reference to Christ and the glories after these things ,
LEB	1%20Peter	1	12	to whom it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you with reference to the same things which now have been announced to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven , things into which [ i ] angels desire to look . Be Holy in All Your Conduct
LEB	1%20Peter	1	13	Therefore , when you have prepared your minds for action [ j ] by [ k ] being self-controlled , put your hope completely in the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
LEB	1%20Peter	1	14	As obedient children , do not be conformed to the former desires you used to conform to [ l ] in your ignorance ,
LEB	1%20Peter	1	15	but as the one who called you is holy , you yourselves be holy in all your conduct ,
LEB	1%20Peter	1	16	for it is written , “ You will be holy , because I am [ m ] holy. ” [ n ] [ o ]
LEB	1%20Peter	1	17	And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one ’ s work , conduct yourselves with fear during the time of your temporary residence ,
LEB	1%20Peter	1	18	because you [ p ] know that you were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your ancestors not with perishable things like silver or gold ,
LEB	1%20Peter	1	19	but with the precious blood of Christ , like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb
LEB	1%20Peter	1	20	who was foreknown before the foundation of the world , but has been revealed in these last times for you
LEB	1%20Peter	1	21	who through him are believing in God , who raised him from the dead and gave him glory , so that your faith and hope are in God .
LEB	1%20Peter	1	22	Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love , love one another fervently from the heart , [ q ]
LEB	1%20Peter	1	23	because you [ r ] have been born again , not from perishable seed but imperishable , through the living and enduring word of God .
LEB	1%20Peter	1	24	For “ all flesh is like grass , and all its glory like the flower of the grass . The grass withers and the flower falls off ,

LEB	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter 2:23 Here “ when ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ suffering ” ) which is understood as temporal
LEB	1%20Peter	2	2	like newborn infants long for the unadulterated spiritual milk , so that by it you may grow up to salvation ,
LEB	1%20Peter	2	3	if you have tasted that the Lord is kind , [ a ]
LEB	1%20Peter	2	4	to whom you are drawing near , a living stone rejected by men but chosen and precious in the sight of God .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	5	And you yourselves , as living stones , are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	6	For it stands in scripture , “ Behold , I am laying in Zion a stone , a chosen and precious cornerstone , and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame. ” [ b ]
LEB	1%20Peter	2	7	Therefore the honor is for you who believe , but for those who refuse to believe , “ The stone that the builders rejected , this one has become the cornerstone [ c ] , ”
LEB	1%20Peter	2	8	and “ A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense , ” [ d ] who stumble because they [ e ] disobey the word to which also they were consigned .

LEB	1%20Peter	2	10	who once were not a people , but now are the people of God , the ones who were not shown mercy , but now are shown mercy . [ g ]
LEB	1%20Peter	2	11	Dear friends , I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents to abstain from fleshly desires which wage war against your [ h ] soul ,
LEB	1%20Peter	2	12	maintaining your good conduct among the Gentiles , so that in the things in which they slander you as evildoers , by seeing your good deeds they may glorify God on the day of visitation . Submission to Established Authority
LEB	1%20Peter	2	13	Subject yourselves to every human authority for the sake of the Lord , whether to a king [ i ] as having supreme authority ,
LEB	1%20Peter	2	14	or to governors as those sent out by him for the punishment of those who do evil and the praise of those who do good .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	15	For the will of God is as follows : by [ j ] doing good to silence the ignorance of foolish people .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	16	Live as free persons , and not using your [ k ] freedom as a covering for evil , but as slaves of God .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	17	Honor all people , love the community of believers , fear God , honor the king . [ l ]
LEB	1%20Peter	2	18	Domestic slaves , be subject to your [ m ] masters with all respect , not only to those who are good and gentle , but also to those who are unjust .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	19	For this finds favor , if because of consciousness of God someone endures sorrows while [ n ] suffering unjustly .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	20	For what credit is it if , when you [ o ] sin and are beaten for it , you endure ? But if you endure when you [ p ] do good and suffer for it , this finds favor with God .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	21	For to this you were called , because Christ also suffered for you , leaving you an example , so that you should follow in his footsteps ,
LEB	1%20Peter	2	22	who did not commit sin , nor was deceit found in his mouth , [ q ]
LEB	1%20Peter	2	23	who when he [ r ] was reviled , did not revile in return ; when [ s ] suffering , he did not threaten , but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly ,
LEB	1%20Peter	2	24	who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , so that we may die to sins and live to righteousness , by whose wounds you were healed .
LEB	1%20Peter	2	25	For you were going astray like sheep , but you have turned back now to the shepherd and guardian of your souls . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter 3:21 Literally “ which ”
LEB	1%20Peter	3	3	Let your [ b ] adornment not be the external kind , braiding hair and putting on gold jewelry or putting on fine clothing ,
LEB	1%20Peter	3	2	when they [ a ] see your respectful , pure conduct .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	4	but the hidden person of the heart , with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is highly valuable in the sight of God .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	5	For in the same way formerly the holy women also , who hoped in God , used to adorn themselves by [ c ] being subject to their own husbands ,
LEB	1%20Peter	3	6	like Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you have become when you [ d ] do good and are not frightened with respect to any terror .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	7	Husbands , in the same way live with your wives knowledgeably [ e ] , as with the weaker female vessel , showing them honor as fellow heirs also of the grace of life , so that your prayers will not be hindered . Called to Inherit a Blessing
LEB	1%20Peter	3	8	And finally , all of you be harmonious , sympathetic , showing mutual affection , compassionate , humble ,
LEB	1%20Peter	3	9	not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult , but on the other hand blessing others , because for this reason you were called , so that you could inherit a blessing .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	10	For “ The one who wants to love life and see good days must keep his [ f ] tongue from evil and his lips must not speak deceit .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	11	And he must turn away from evil and do good ; he must seek peace and pursue it .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears are open to their prayer . But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . [ g ] Suffer for Doing What is Good
LEB	1%20Peter	3	13	And who is the one who will harm you if you are a zealous adherent for what is good ?
LEB	1%20Peter	3	14	But even if you might suffer for the sake of righteousness , you are blessed . And do not be afraid of their intimidation or be disturbed , [ h ]
LEB	1%20Peter	3	15	but set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts , always ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an accounting concerning the hope that is in you .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	16	But do so with courtesy and respect , having a good conscience , so that in the things in which you are slandered , the ones who malign your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better to suffer for doing good , if God wills it [ i ] , than for doing evil .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ also suffered once for sins , the just for the unjust , in order that he could bring you to God , being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ,
LEB	1%20Peter	3	19	in which also he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison ,
LEB	1%20Peter	3	20	who were formerly disobedient , when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah , while [ j ] an ark was being constructed , in which a few—that is , eight souls—were rescued through water .
LEB	1%20Peter	3	21	And [ k ] also , corresponding to this , baptism now saves you , not the removal of dirt from the flesh , but an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ ,

LEB	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter 4:18 This verse contains a quotation from Prov 11:31
LEB	1%20Peter	4	4	with respect to which they are surprised when [ c ] you do not run with them into the same flood of dissipation , and so they [ d ] revile you .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	2	in order to live the remaining time in the flesh no longer for human desires , but for the will of God .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time that has passed was sufficient to do what the Gentiles desire to do [ b ] , having lived in licentiousness , evil desires , drunkenness , carousing , drinking parties , and wanton idolatries ,
LEB	1%20Peter	4	5	They [ e ] will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	6	Because for this reason also the gospel was preached to those who are dead , so that they were judged by human standards [ f ] in the flesh , but they may live in the spirit by God ’ s standards [ g ] . Serving to the Glory of God
LEB	1%20Peter	4	7	Now the end of all things draws near . Therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for your prayers .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	8	Above all , keep [ h ] your love for one another constant , because love covers a large number of sins .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	9	Be hospitable to one another without complaining .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	10	Just as each one has received a gift , use it for serving one another , as good stewards of the varied grace of God .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	11	If anyone speaks , let it be as the oracles of God ; if anyone serves , let it be as by the strength that God provides , so that in all things God will be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom is the glory and the power forever and ever [ i ] . Amen . Sharing the Sufferings of Christ
LEB	1%20Peter	4	12	Dear friends , do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you , when it [ j ] takes place to test you , as if something strange were happening to you .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	13	But to the degree that you share in the sufferings of Christ , rejoice , so that also at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice and be glad .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	14	If you are reviled on account of the name of Christ , you are blessed , because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	15	By all means do not let anyone of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	16	But if someone suffers as a Christian , he must not be ashamed , but must glorify God with this name .
LEB	1%20Peter	4	17	For it is the time for the judgment to begin out from the household of God . But if it begins out from us first , what will be the outcome for those who are disobedient to the gospel of God ?
LEB	1%20Peter	4	18	And if the righteous are saved with difficulty , what will become of the ungodly and the sinner [ k ] ? [ l ]
LEB	1%20Peter	4	19	So then also those who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing good . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter 5:12 Literally “ by a few ”
LEB	1%20Peter	5	5	In the same way , younger men , be subject to the elders , and all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another , because God opposes the proud , but gives grace to the humble .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	2	shepherd the flock of God among you , exercising oversight not by compulsion but willingly , in accordance with God , and not greedily but eagerly ,
LEB	1%20Peter	5	3	and not as lording it over those under your care [ b ] , but being examples for the flock .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	4	And when [ c ] the chief Shepherd appears , you will receive the unfading crown of glory .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , so that he may exalt you at the right time ,
LEB	1%20Peter	5	7	casting all your cares on him , because he cares [ d ] for you .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	8	Be sober ; be on the alert . Your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion , looking for someone to devour .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	9	Resist him [ e ] , steadfast in your [ f ] faith , because you [ g ] know the same kinds of sufferings are being accomplished by your community of believers in the world .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	10	And the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory in Christ , [ h ] after you [ i ] have suffered for a short time , will himself restore , confirm , strengthen , and establish you .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	11	To him be the power forever and ever [ j ] . [ k ] Amen . Conclusion and Final Greetings
LEB	1%20Peter	5	12	Through Silvanus , the faithful brother ( as I consider him ) , I have written to you briefly [ l ] to encourage you and to attest that this is the true grace of God . Stand firm in it .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	13	She who is in Babylon , chosen the same as you , greets you , and so does my son Mark .
LEB	1%20Peter	5	14	Greet one another with a loving kiss . Peace to all of you who are in Christ . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Peter	1	2	Peter 1:19 Here “ if ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ pay attention to ” ) which is understood as conditional
LEB	2%20Peter	1	1	Simeon Peter , a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a faith equal in value to ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	3	because his divine power has bestowed on us all things that are necessary for life and godliness , through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence of character ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	4	through which things he has bestowed on us his precious and very great promises , so that through these you may become sharers of the divine nature after [ a ] escaping from the corruption that is in the world because of evil desire ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	5	and for this same reason , and by [ b ] applying all diligence , supply with your faith excellence of character , and with excellence of character , knowledge ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	6	and with knowledge , self-control , and with self-control , patient endurance , and with patient endurance , godliness ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	7	and with godliness , brotherly love , and with brotherly love , love . Make Your Calling and Election Secure
LEB	2%20Peter	1	8	For if [ c ] these things are yours and are increasing , this does not make you useless or unproductive in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	9	For the one for whom these things are not present is blind , being nearsighted , having forgotten the cleansing [ d ] of his former sins .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	10	Therefore , brothers , be zealous even more to make your calling and election secure , because if you [ e ] do these things , you will never ever stumble .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	11	For in this way entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied for you .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	12	Therefore I intend to remind you continually concerning these things , although you know them and are established in the truth that you have .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	13	But I consider it right , for as long as I am in this habitation , to stir you up by a reminder ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	14	because I [ f ] know that the removal of my habitation is imminent , as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	15	And I will also make every effort that you are able at any time , after my departure , to recall these things to mind [ g ] . The Reliable Prophetic Word of Testimony
LEB	2%20Peter	1	16	For we did not make known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by [ h ] following ingeniously concocted myths , but by [ i ] being eyewitnesses of that one ’ s majesty .
LEB	2%20Peter	1	17	For he received honor and glory from God the Father when [ j ] a voice such as this was brought to him by the Majestic Glory , “ This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased. ”
LEB	2%20Peter	1	18	And we ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven when we [ k ] were with him on the holy mountain ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	19	and we possess as more reliable the prophetic word , to which you do well if you [ l ] pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place , until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	20	recognizing this above all , that every prophecy of scripture does not come about from one ’ s own interpretation ,
LEB	2%20Peter	1	21	for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man , but men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God . Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Peter	2	2	Peter 2:22 The source of this quotation is uncertain
LEB	2%20Peter	2	3	And in greediness they will exploit you with false words , whose condemnation from long ago is not idle , and their destruction is not asleep .
LEB	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God did not spare the angels who sinned , but held them captive in Tartarus with chains of darkness and handed them over to be kept for judgment ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	5	and did not spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah , a proclaimer of righteousness , and seven others [ c ] when he [ d ] brought a flood on the world of the ungodly ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	6	and condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction , reducing them to ashes , having appointed them as an example for those who are going to be ungodly ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	7	and rescued righteous Lot , worn down by the way of life of lawless persons in licentiousness
LEB	2%20Peter	2	8	( for that righteous man , as he [ e ] lived among them day after day , was tormenting his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he was seeing and hearing ) ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	9	then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to reserve the unrighteous to be punished at [ f ] the day of judgment ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	10	and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust [ g ] and who despise authority . Bold and arrogant , they do not tremble in awe as they [ h ] blaspheme majestic beings ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	11	whereas angels , who are greater in strength and power , do not bring against them a demeaning judgment . [ i ]
LEB	2%20Peter	2	12	But these persons , like irrational animals born only with natural instincts for capture and killing , blaspheming about things [ j ] they do not understand , in their destruction will also be destroyed ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	13	being harmed as the wages of unrighteousness . Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure , they are stains and blemishes , carousing in their deceitful pleasures when they [ k ] feast together with you ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	14	having eyes full of desire for an adulteress and unceasing from sin , enticing unstable persons , and [ l ] having hearts trained for greediness . Accursed children !
LEB	2%20Peter	2	15	By [ m ] leaving the straight path , they have gone astray , because they [ n ] followed the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , [ o ] who loved the wages of unrighteousness ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	16	but received a rebuke for his own lawlessness : a speechless donkey , speaking with a human voice , restrained the prophet ’ s madness [ p ] .
LEB	2%20Peter	2	17	These people are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane , for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved .
LEB	2%20Peter	2	18	For by speaking high-sounding but empty words [ q ] , they entice with desires of the flesh and with licentiousness those who are scarcely escaping from those who live in error ,
LEB	2%20Peter	2	19	promising them freedom although they [ r ] themselves are slaves of depravity . For to whatever someone succumbs , by this he is also [ s ] enslaved .
LEB	2%20Peter	2	20	For if , after they [ t ] have escaped from the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord [ u ] and Savior Jesus Christ , and they are again entangled in these things and succumb to them , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
LEB	2%20Peter	2	21	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it , to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them .
LEB	2%20Peter	2	22	The statement of the true proverb has happened to them , “ A dog returns to its own vomit , ” [ v ] and “ A sow , after [ w ] washing herself , returns [ x ] to wallowing in the mud. ” [ y ] Footnotes -

LEB	2%20Peter	3	2	Peter 3:17 Here “ because ” is supplied as a component of the participle ( “ have been led away ” ) which is understood as causal
LEB	2%20Peter	3	3	above all knowing this , that in the last days scoffers will come with scoffing , following according to their own desires
LEB	2%20Peter	3	4	and saying , “ Where is the promise of his coming ? For ever since [ a ] the fathers fell asleep , all things have continued just as they have been from the beginning of creation. ”
LEB	2%20Peter	3	5	For when [ b ] they maintain this , it escapes their notice that the heavens existed long ago and the earth held together out of water and through water by the word of God ,
LEB	2%20Peter	3	6	by means of which things the world that existed at that time was destroyed by [ c ] being inundated with water .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	7	But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire , being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	8	Now , dear friends , do not let this one thing escape your notice , that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years , and a thousand years is like one day .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not delaying the promise , as some consider slowness , but is being patient toward you , because he [ d ] does not want any to perish , but all to come to repentance .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief , in which the heavens will disappear with a rushing noise , and the celestial bodies will be destroyed by [ e ] being burned up , and the earth and the deeds done on it will be disclosed .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	11	Because [ f ] all these things are being destroyed in this way , what sort of people must you be in holy behavior and godliness ,
LEB	2%20Peter	3	12	while [ g ] waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God , because of which the heavens will be destroyed by [ h ] being burned up and the celestial bodies will melt as they [ i ] are consumed by heat !
LEB	2%20Peter	3	13	But according to his promise , we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness resides . Final Exhortations and Conclusion
LEB	2%20Peter	3	14	Therefore , dear friends , because you [ j ] are waiting for these things , make every effort to be found at peace , spotless and unblemished in him .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	15	And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation , just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you , according to the wisdom that was given to him ,
LEB	2%20Peter	3	16	as he does also in all his [ k ] [ l ] letters , speaking in them about these things , in which there are some things hard to understand , which the ignorant and unstable distort to their own destruction , as they also do the rest of the scriptures .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	17	Therefore , dear friends , because you [ m ] know this beforehand , guard yourselves so that you do not lose your own safe position because you [ n ] have been led away by the error of lawless persons .
LEB	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ . To him be the glory , both now and to the day of eternity . Amen . Footnotes -

LEB	1%20John	1	4	And these things we write , in order that our joy may be complete . God is Light , so Walk in the Light
LEB	1%20John	1	5	And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you , that God is light and there is no darkness in him at all .
LEB	1%20John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness , we lie and do not practice the truth . [ a ]
LEB	1%20John	1	7	But if we walk in the light as he is in the light , we have fellowship with one another , and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin .

LEB	1%20John	2	3	And by this we know that we have come to know him , if we keep his commandments .
LEB	1%20John	2	4	The one who says “ I have come to know him , ” and does not keep his commandments is a liar , and the truth is not in this person .
LEB	1%20John	2	5	But whoever keeps his word , truly in this person the love of God has been perfected . By this we know that we are in him .
LEB	1%20John	2	6	The one who says that he resides in him ought also to walk [ c ] just as that one walked .
LEB	1%20John	2	7	Dear friends , I am not writing a new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning . The old commandment is the message which you have heard .
LEB	1%20John	2	8	Again , I am writing a new commandment to you , which is true in him and in you , because [ d ] the darkness is passing away and the true light already is shining .
LEB	1%20John	2	9	The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now .
LEB	1%20John	2	10	The one who loves his brother resides in the light , and there is no cause for stumbling in him .

LEB	1%20John	2	15	Do not love the world or the things in the world . If anyone loves the world , the love of the Father is not in him ,
LEB	1%20John	2	16	because everything that is in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance of material possessions—is not from the Father , but is from the world .
LEB	1%20John	2	17	And the world is passing away , and its desire , [ k ] but the one who does the will of God remains forever [ l ] . Departure of the False Teachers

LEB	1%20John	2	22	Who is the liar except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This person is the antichrist , the one who denies the Father and the Son .
LEB	1%20John	2	23	Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either ; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also .
LEB	1%20John	2	24	As for you , what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you . If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son and in the Father .
LEB	1%20John	2	25	And this is the promise which he himself promised us : eternal life .

LEB	1%20John	3	4	Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness , and sin is lawlessness .
LEB	1%20John	3	5	And you know that that one was revealed in order that he might take away sins , and in him there is no sin .
LEB	1%20John	3	6	Everyone who resides in him does not sin . Everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him .
LEB	1%20John	3	7	Little children , let no one deceive you : the one who practices righteousness is righteous , just as that one is righteous .
LEB	1%20John	3	8	The one who practices sin is of the devil , because the devil has been sinning from the beginning . For this reason the Son of God was revealed : in order to destroy the works of the devil .
LEB	1%20John	3	9	Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin , because his seed resides in him , and he is not able to sin , because he has been fathered by God .

LEB	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning : that we should love one another ,
LEB	1%20John	3	12	not as Cain , who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother . And for what reason [ a ] did he violently murder him ? Because his deeds were evil and the deeds of his brother were righteous .
LEB	1%20John	3	13	Do not marvel , [ b ] brothers , if the world hates you .
LEB	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers . The one who does not love remains in death .
LEB	1%20John	3	15	Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer , and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life residing in him .
LEB	1%20John	3	16	We have come to know love by this : that he [ c ] laid down his life on behalf of us , and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers .
LEB	1%20John	3	17	But whoever has the world ’ s material possessions and observes his brother in need [ d ] and shuts his heart against him , how does the love of God reside in him ?
LEB	1%20John	3	18	Little children , let us not love with word or with tongue , but in deed and truth .
LEB	1%20John	3	19	By this [ e ] we know that we are of the truth and will convince our heart before him ,
LEB	1%20John	3	20	that [ f ] if our heart condemns us , that God is greater than our heart and knows all things .
LEB	1%20John	3	21	Dear friends , if our heart does not condemn us , we have confidence before God ,
LEB	1%20John	3	22	and whatever we ask we receive from him , because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight [ g ] .
LEB	1%20John	3	23	And this is his commandment : that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another , just as he commanded us [ h ] .

LEB	Revelation	14	14	And I looked , and behold , a white cloud , and on the cloud was seated one like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
LEB	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder , and the sound that I heard was like harpists playing on their harps .
LEB	Revelation	14	3	And they were singing something like a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders , and no one was able to learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth .

LEB	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another angel flying directly overhead [ a ] , having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who reside on the earth , and to every nation and tribe and language and people ,
LEB	Revelation	14	7	saying with a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him glory , because the hour of his judgment has come , and worship the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water ! ”

LEB	Revelation	14	10	he himself also will drink of the wine of the anger of God that has been mixed full strength in the cup of his wrath , and will be tortured with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb .
LEB	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torture went up forever and ever [ b ] , and those who worshiped the beast and his image did not have rest day and night , along with anyone who received [ c ] the mark of his name .
