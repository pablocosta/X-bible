NCB	Matthew	1	3	Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah , with Tamar [ d ] being their mother . Perez was the father of Hezron , Hezron the father of Ram ,

NCB	Matthew	1	5	; 16:15 ) ; so were kings (
NCB	Matthew	1	6	and Jesse was the father of King David . David was the father of Solomon , whose mother had been the wife of Uriah .
NCB	Matthew	1	7	Solomon was the father of Rehoboam , Rehoboam the father of Abijah , Abijah the father of Asa .
NCB	Matthew	1	8	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat the father of Joram , Joram the father of Uzziah .
NCB	Matthew	1	9	Uzziah was the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , Ahaz the father of Hezekiah .

NCB	Matthew	1	11	; 12:24 ) , and Ruth ( see Book of Ruth ) . These four women were foreigners who in some way became part of the history of Israel . They symbolize the salvation that God intends for all peoples . - Matthew 1:16 It is important to note that in the case of Christ ’ s birth , the text uses a formula that is far different from the one used for the other persons in the genealogy . In doing so , the evangelist is paving the way for the teaching of Christ ’ s virginal conception , which took place without the intervention of any man . - Matthew 1:18 At the beginning of creation the Spirit made the waters fruitful ( Gen 1:2 ; Ps 33:6-7 ) ; the Spirit restored life to a people who had been destroyed and were in exile ( Ezek 37:1-14 ; Isa 44:2-4 ) . Now the Spirit creates the new human being , the new Israel , in the womb of the Virgin . How mysterious the interventions of God that turn upside down the course of events and the ways of human beings ! Joseph , who is irrevocably bound to Mary because at that time an espousal was a definitive act , is witness to the incomprehensible ; he has too much trust in his wife to abandon her to the sentence imposed by the Law if she were to be thought an adulteress . But who will show him the way out of this impossible situation ? A revelation of heaven makes his mission known to him in a dream , as the announcement of angels and messengers had to the patriarchs . Joseph obeys , and through him Jesus finds a place publicly in the dynasty of David . What will this son become , whose name “ Jesus ” is already a program , since it means “ God saves ” ? The prophecy of Isaiah , which had remained mysterious to the minds of believers , is now fulfilled . Such is the main message of this text that was originally addressed to Jews , namely , that God is in our midst to give us victory and to live the covenant to the full . “ Emmanuel ” means “ God is with us ” ( Lk 1:31 ; Jn 1:14 ) . That is the ultimate message . - Matthew 1:21 Jesus : is a transcription of the Greek Iêsous , which in turn is a transcription of the Hebrew Jehoshuah ( “ Joshua ” in translations ) or Jeshua in its later form . It means “ God saves. ” - Matthew 1:23 See Isa 7:14 . God ’ s promise of salvation to Judah in the time of Isaiah is seen to be fulfilled in the birth of Jesus . This is the first of some
NCB	Matthew	1	12	After the deportation to Babylon , Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel , Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
NCB	Matthew	1	13	Zerubabbel the father of Abiud . Abiud was the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor ,
NCB	Matthew	1	14	Azor the father of Zadok . Zadok was the father of Achim , Achim the father of Eliud ,
NCB	Matthew	1	15	Eliud the father of Eleazar . Eleazar was the father of Matthan , Matthan the father of Jacob .
NCB	Matthew	1	16	Jacob was the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , who gave birth to Jesus who is called the Christ . [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	1	17	Therefore , in total there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David , another fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon , and another fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ .
NCB	Matthew	1	18	The Birth of Jesus . [ f ] The birth of Jesus Christ occurred in this way . When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph , but before they came to live together , she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit .
NCB	Matthew	1	19	Her husband Joseph was a just man and did not wish to expose her to the ordeal of public disgrace ; therefore , he resolved to divorce her quietly .
NCB	Matthew	1	20	After he had decided to follow this course of action , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to receive Mary into your home as your wife . For this child has been conceived in her womb through the Holy Spirit .
NCB	Matthew	1	21	She will give birth to a son , and you shall name him Jesus , [ g ] for he will save his people from their sins. ”
NCB	Matthew	1	22	All this took place in order to fulfill what the Lord had announced through the prophet :
NCB	Matthew	1	23	“ Behold , the virgin shall conceive and give birth to a son , and they shall name him Emmanuel , ” a name that means “ God is with us. ” [ h ]
NCB	Matthew	1	24	When Joseph rose from sleep , he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him . He took Mary into his home as his wife ,
NCB	Matthew	1	25	but he engaged in no marital relations [ i ] with her until she gave birth to a son , whom he named Jesus . Footnotes - Matthew 1:1 Who was Jesus ? Where did he come from ? The prologue of Matthew ’ s Gospel immediately confronts us with this question . The author has not simply gathered up some scattered recollections to complete his album on the life of Christ ; rather , from the very first moment he is transmitting the Church ’ s testimony of faith . - Matthew 1:1 To the ancients a genealogical tree was not only a set of data on one ’ s civil status but also a manifestation of one ’ s membership in a community and the importance of ancestry ( Gen 5:1-11 ; Ex 6:14-24 ;
NCB	Matthew	1	38	;
NCB	Matthew	1	60	citations , most of them Messianic , that Matthew takes from the Old Testament . - Matthew 1:25 Engaged in no marital relations : literally , “ did not know , ” “ know ” being the usual word for conjugal relations ( see Gen 4:1 ) . The meaning of “ he engaged in no marital relations with her . . . ” is : “ without his knowing her , she bore a son. ” The Hebrew word “ until ” neither implies nor excludes marital conduct after Jesus ’ birth .
NCB	Matthew	2	2	Sam 5:1-3 ) : the new future of the People of God originates in the dynasty of David and in his native place , Bethlehem (
NCB	Matthew	2	1	Sam
NCB	Matthew	2	3	On hearing about their inquiry , King Herod was greatly troubled , as was true of the whole of Jerusalem .
NCB	Matthew	2	4	B.C . to A.D.
NCB	Matthew	2	5	; 49:23 ; 60:1-5 ; Lk 2:30-34 ) . - Matthew 2:1 Bethlehem : about five miles south of Jerusalem . - Matthew 2:4 Chief priests : in the plural signifies the high priest now in office and his predecessors and members of their respective families . Herod ’ s act of consulting with the chief priests and teachers of the Law has some affinity with a Jewish legend about the child Moses in which Pharaoh is warned by sacred scribes about the coming birth of a deliverer of Israel from Egypt and plots to destroy the deliverer . - Matthew 2:6 This prophecy of Micah ( 5:1 ) had been pronounced seven centuries earlier . - Matthew 2:11 Because of the Old Testament texts of Ps 72:11 ,
NCB	Matthew	2	6	) and was deposed because of his cruelty . After him Judea became a Roman province administered by “ procurators ” appointed by the Emperor . Galilee : the northern part of Palestine , whose principal cities were : Capernaum , Cana , Nazareth , and Tiberias . Its people were not very highly esteemed by the Jews of Jerusalem and Judea ( see Jn 1:46 ; 7:52 ) probably because of the strong Hellenization of the region and the mixed ( Jew-Gentile ) population there . It was the primary region of Jesus ’ public ministry and is viewed as a providential indicator of his Messianic mission to the Gentiles ( see Isa 66:18f ; Am 9:11f ) . - Matthew 2:23 Nazareth : a town that stands on the last spurs of the Galilean hills , some
NCB	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men , and he ascertained from them the exact time of the star ’ s appearance ,
NCB	Matthew	2	8	after which he sent them on to Bethlehem , saying : “ Go forth and search diligently for the child . When you have found him , bring me word , so that I can go and pay him homage. ”
NCB	Matthew	2	9	After receiving these instructions from the king , the wise men set out . And behold , the star that they had seen at its rising proceeded ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was .
NCB	Matthew	2	10	The sight of the star filled them with great joy ,
NCB	Matthew	2	11	and when they entered the house they beheld the child with Mary his mother . Falling to their knees , they paid him homage . Then they opened their treasure chests and offered him gifts of gold , frankincense , and myrrh . [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	2	12	And since they had been warned in a dream not to return to Herod , they departed for their own country by another route .
NCB	Matthew	2	13	The Flight into Egypt . After the wise men had left , an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and instructed him , “ Arise , take the child and his mother , and flee to Egypt . Remain there until I tell you . Herod seeks the child to kill him. ”
NCB	Matthew	2	14	Therefore , he got up , took the child and his mother , and departed that night for Egypt ,
NCB	Matthew	2	15	where they remained until the death of Herod . This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet : “ Out of Egypt I called my son. ” [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	2	16	; Isa 60:6 , the wise men were thought to be kings . House : indicates that the wise men did not visit Jesus on the night of his birth as did the shepherds . Although there are three gifts , this does not mean there were three wise men . - Matthew 2:15 The citation from Hos 11:1 , which originally referred to God ’ s calling Israel ( God ’ s son ) out of Egypt , is here applied to Jesus . Just as Israel was called out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus , so Jesus , the Son of God , will be called out of Egypt at the New Exodus . - Matthew 2:17 The citation of Jer 31:15 originally referred to Rachel , the wife of Jacob , weeping for her children taken into exile in
NCB	Matthew	2	17	[ g ] Thus were fulfilled the words that had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah :
NCB	Matthew	2	18	“ A voice was heard in Ramah , lamenting and sobbing bitterly : Rachel weeping for her children , and refusing to be consoled , because they were no more. ”
NCB	Matthew	2	19	The Return to the Land of Israel . [ h ] After the death of Herod , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
NCB	Matthew	2	20	and said , “ Arise , take the child and his mother , and go to the land of Israel , for those who sought to kill the child are dead. ” [ i ]
NCB	Matthew	2	21	He got up , took the child and his mother , and returned to the land of Israel .
NCB	Matthew	2	22	But when Joseph learned that Archelaus [ j ] had succeeded his father Herod in Judea , he was afraid to go there . After he had been warned in a dream concerning this , he withdrew to the region of Galilee .
NCB	Matthew	2	23	is alluding . Some believe Matthew is here thinking of the Old Testament declarations that the Messiah would be despised ( e.g. , Ps 22:6 ; Isa 53:3 ) , for “ Nazorean ” was a synonym for “ despised ” ( see Jn 1:45f ) . Or he may be saying that according to the plan of God Jesus was to live his childhood and youth in Nazareth and begin his ministry there . Some think “ Nazorean ” fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah ( 11:1 ) : Jesus is the “ shoot ” ( nezer in Hebrew ) of the race of Abraham and David . - Matthew 2:20 For those who sought to kill the child are dead : another subtle reference to the Moses-Christ parallel . After fleeing from Egypt because the Pharaoh sought to kill him , Moses was told to return in similar words : “ for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead ” ( Ex 4:19 ) . - Matthew 2:22 Archelaus : son of Herod who ruled Judea and Samaria for ten years (
NCB	Matthew	2	721	B.C . Matthew applies it to the mourning for the Holy Innocents . - Matthew 2:19 Herod died in
NCB	Matthew	2	87	miles north of Jerusalem .
NCB	Matthew	3	3	) ; the theophany that here begins the New Testament reveals something of the inner life of God : God is three persons . The dove perhaps suggests the Creator Spirit ( Gen 1:2 ) , but may also symbolize the divine goodwill that was restored after the flood ( Gen 8:8-12 ) , or the very People of God ( Hos 7:11 ; 11:11 ; Isa 60:8 ) , the formation of which is the work of the Spirit . - Matthew 3:15 All that righteousness demands : i.e. , all observances , everything that is part of God ’ s plan . Jesus obeys the Father ’ s will in everything ( Phil 2:8 ) . - Matthew 3:17 This heavenly pronouncement intermingles language from Ps 2:7 and Isa 42:1 , prophetic terminology that was well known to those with Messianic expectations ( see Mt 17:5 ; Mk 1:11 ; 9:7 ; Lk 3:22 ; 9:35 ) .
NCB	Matthew	3	1	In those days , John the Baptist [ b ] appeared in the desert of Judea , preaching :
NCB	Matthew	3	2	Ki
NCB	Matthew	3	4	John ’ s clothing was made of camel ’ s hair , with a leather loincloth around his waist , and his food consisted of locusts and wild honey . [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	3	5	The people of Jerusalem and the whole of Judea and the entire region along the Jordan went out to him ,
NCB	Matthew	3	6	) , his criticism of the Pharisees and Sadducees ( vv . 7-10 ) , his teaching about Jesus ( vv . 11-12 ) , and his baptism of Jesus ( vv . 15-17 ) . - Matthew 3:1 John the Baptist : the cousin and precursor of Jesus ( see Lk 1:5-80 ) . Desert of Judea : a twenty-mile barren region from the Jerusalem-Bethlehem plateau to the Jordan River and the Dead Sea . - Matthew 3:2 Repent : a change of heart and conduct—a return to keeping the Mosaic Law . Kingdom of heaven : a phrase found only in Matthew (
NCB	Matthew	3	7	[ f ] But when he observed many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism , he said to them , “ You brood of vipers ! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
NCB	Matthew	3	8	; 2:1-16 ) . Refusal of this Baptism instituted by Christ leads to final condemnation in imperishable fire ( see Isa 34:8ff ; Jer 7:20 ) . - Matthew 3:12 The separation of the good and the bad that will take place at Christ ’ s Second Coming is compared to the way farmers separated wheat from chaff . After trampling out the grain , they used a large fork to pitch the grain and the chaff into the air . The kernels of wheat fell to the ground while the light chaff was borne away by the wind , then gathered up and burned . - Matthew 3:13 The theophanies of the Old Testament were meant to convey something of the ineffable transcendence of God ( Ex
NCB	Matthew	3	9	Do not presume to say to yourselves : ‘ We have Abraham as our father. ’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones .
NCB	Matthew	3	10	Even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees . Therefore , every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire .
NCB	Matthew	3	11	[ g ] “ I baptize you with water for repentance , but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I am . I am not worthy to carry his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
NCB	Matthew	3	12	His winnowing fan is in his hand . He will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into his barn , but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. ” [ h ]
NCB	Matthew	3	13	Jesus Is Baptized . [ i ] Then Jesus arrived from Galilee and came to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him .
NCB	Matthew	3	14	John tried to dissuade him , saying , “ Why do you come to me ? I am the one who needs to be baptized by you. ”
NCB	Matthew	3	15	But Jesus said to him in reply , “ For the present , let it be thus . It is proper for us to do this to fulfill all that righteousness demands. ” [ j ] Then he acquiesced .
NCB	Matthew	3	16	After Jesus had been baptized , as he came up from the water , suddenly the heavens were opened and he beheld the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him .
NCB	Matthew	3	17	) , and Jesus later declares that John was the Elijah who had already come ( see Mt 17:10ff ; see also Mal 3:23 ) . - Matthew 3:7 John heavily criticizes members of two religious sects of the Jews who come to receive his baptism . The Pharisees were a legalistic and separatist group who strictly kept the Law of Moses as well as the unwritten “ tradition of the elders ” ( Mt 15:2 ) . The Sadducees were more worldly and politically minded , closely connected with the high priests , and they accepted only the first five Books of the Old Testament as their Scriptures . They also rejected belief in the resurrection after death . - Matthew 3:11 I am not worthy to carry his sandals : bearing sandals was one of the duties of a slave . The baptism of John prepares for the purifying action with the Holy Spirit and fire that Jesus will effect ( see Isa 1:25 ; Zec 13:9 ; Mal 3:2 ) and that was seen very dramatically at Pentecost ( Acts 1:5 ,
NCB	Matthew	3	33	times ) ; in Mark and Luke it is “ kingdom of God. ” The kingdom of heaven is the rule of God , both as present reality and as future hope . The kingdom is a central part of Jesus ’ message . - Matthew 3:3 All four Gospels quote Isa 40:3 and apply it to John the Baptist . Make his paths straight : a phrase that is equivalent to “ Prepare the way for the Lord ” in Lk 3:4 . In ancient times , when the king was to travel to a distant land , the roads were improved . Similarly , the spiritual preparation for the coming of the Messiah was made by John in calling for repentance and the remission of sins and announcing the need for a Savior . - Matthew 3:4 John ’ s simple food , clothing , and lifestyle were reminiscent of Elijah ( see
NCB	Matthew	4	4	Jesus answered , “ As it is written : ‘ Man does not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God. ’ ” [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	4	1	Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil .
NCB	Matthew	4	2	. - Matthew 4:4 A citation of Deut 8:3 , indicating that the miracles of the Exodus were signs of God ’ s religious care for Israel . - Matthew 4:5 Summit of the temple : the southeast corner of the wall of the Jerusalem temple , projecting over a ravine . - Matthew 4:6 The devil applies Ps 91:11-12 to the Messiah since it deals with God ’ s protection of the righteous . Jesus declares ( through the words of Deut 6:16 ) that we should not demand miracles from God as evidence of his care for us . - Matthew 4:10 The citation ( Deut 6:13 ) used by Jesus calls for the basic attitude of worship that everyone should have toward God . - Matthew 4:12 By action and word Jesus inaugurates the kingdom of heaven . The phrase means the kingdom of God , but , like the Jews of his time , Matthew avoids naming God and says , instead , “ heaven. ” This kingdom or reign is a power that will continue to make its way into the world from now on . Jesus begins his activity in Galilee , a northern province , which some , thinking of Isa 8:23 and 9:1 , regarded as the Messiah ’ s land . It was a region in which different populations and religions lived side by side . The faithful followers of Yahweh , who were pretty much cut off from Jerusalem and its temple , gathered in the synagogues . Different populations , even in the pagan Decapolis ( a confederation of ten independent Greek cities , beyond the Jordan ) , acknowledge the Messiah . - Matthew 4:12 John had been arrested : after John ’ s arrest ( v.
NCB	Matthew	4	3	Then the tempter approached him and said , “ If you are the Son of God , [ b ] command these stones to be transformed into loaves of bread. ”
NCB	Matthew	4	5	Next the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the summit of the temple . [ d ]
NCB	Matthew	4	6	[ e ] Then he said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down . For it is written : ‘ He will command his angels concerning you , and with their hands they will raise you up lest you dash your foot against a stone. ’ ”
NCB	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said to him , “ It is also written : ‘ You shall not put the Lord your God to the test. ’ ”
NCB	Matthew	4	8	Finally , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their splendor .
NCB	Matthew	4	9	Then he said to him , “ All these will I give you if you kneel down and worship me. ”
NCB	Matthew	4	10	Jesus said to him in reply , “ Depart from me , Satan ! It is written : ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God , and him alone shall you serve. ’ ” [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil departed from him , and suddenly angels came and ministered to him .
NCB	Matthew	4	12	) , Jesus makes Capernaum the center of his activity ( v.
NCB	Matthew	4	13	) and preaching ( v.
NCB	Matthew	4	14	in order that what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled :
NCB	Matthew	4	15	“ Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , the passageway to the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles :
NCB	Matthew	4	16	The people who lived in darkness have seen a great light , and for those who dwell in a land darkened by the shadow of death light has dawned. ”
NCB	Matthew	4	17	) . The citation from Isa 9:1-2 identifies the ministry of Jesus as fulfilling the prophecy of the restoration of the northern kingdom defeated by the Assyrians in
NCB	Matthew	4	18	) , also known as the Lake of Tiberias or Gennesaret , in territory that had belonged to the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali . - Matthew 4:18 We see the first Church being born ; disciples follow the Lord not only to share intimacy with him but to be fishers of men , to be witnesses to him and gather together people in his name—for he is the Messiah . Three of the four ( Simon , James , and John ) will go on to hold a closer relationship with Jesus ( see Mt 17:1 ; 26:37 ; Lk 8:51 ) . - Matthew 4:23 As a conclusion to the first part of his Gospel , Matthew gives a summary of Jesus ’ ministry , which consisted in teaching , preaching , and healing ( v.
NCB	Matthew	4	19	He said to them , “ Come , follow me , and I will make you fishers of men. ”
NCB	Matthew	4	20	Immediately , they abandoned their nets and followed him .
NCB	Matthew	4	21	As he proceeded farther , he saw two more brothers , James the son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They were in a boat with their father Zebedee , mending their nets , and he called them .
NCB	Matthew	4	22	Immediately , they left their boat and their father and followed him .
NCB	Matthew	4	23	; see also Mt 9:35 ) . - Matthew 4:24 Syria : the area north of Galilee , between Damascus and the Mediterranean Sea . - Matthew 4:25 Decapolis ( i.e. , the Ten Cities ) : a league of Greek cities ; all were east of the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan River except Sythcopolis ( Beth Shan ) .
NCB	Matthew	4	24	His reputation spread throughout Syria , [ l ] and they brought to him all those who were sick , afflicted with various diseases , racked with pain , or possessed by demons , as well as those who were stricken with epilepsy or paralyzed , and he healed them .
NCB	Matthew	4	25	Great throngs from Galilee , the Decapolis , [ m ] Jerusalem , and Judea , and from beyond the Jordan , followed him . Footnotes - Matthew 4:1 This important passage is again filled with echoes and citations of the Old Testament . The intention is to show the experience and struggles of the Messiah , the new head of the People of God . Just as Moses remained forty days on Sinai , so the Messiah remains forty days in the wilderness ( Ex 34:28 ) , forty days being symbolic of a time of preparation for divinely planned activities . Jesus refuses to make use of his miraculous power simply to relieve human need ( v. 3f ) , or to satisfy requests of unbelievers ( v. 5ff ) , or to embrace a Messianic role that would be purely political . The basic theme is the obedience of Jesus to God as he is known through the Old Testament . He rebuffs all three temptations with Scriptural truth from Deuteronomy . - Matthew 4:3 If you are the Son of God : in the sense of the Messianic King of Ps
NCB	Matthew	4	721	B.C . See notes on Mk 1:14 and Lk 3:20 . - Matthew 4:13 Capernaum : on the shore of the Lake ( in Hebrew : Sea ) of Galilee ( v.
NCB	Matthew	5	5	Blessed are the meek , for they will inherit the earth .
NCB	Matthew	5	2	Ki 23:10 ; Jer 7:31 ) . To embrace the kingdom of God is to become a person of reconciliation , to free oneself of all murderous desires . Indeed , even when they suffer offenses but are innocent , the disciples of Jesus must have the courage to take the first step toward establishing peace . - Matthew 5:22 Gehenna : a little valley southwest of Jerusalem and a popular image of hell because of the refuse that burned there continually . - Matthew 5:26 Penny : the smallest Roman copper coin . - Matthew 5:27 At this period , the laws on divorce were tolerant for husbands , intransigent for wives . Jesus rejects this inequality and confronts husbands with their responsibilities by radically condemning divorce . Matthew ’ s text contains the clause , “ except if the marriage was unlawful , ” which is lacking in the parallel passages of Luke and Mark , but occurs again in Mt 19:9 . The Greek word porneia , “ unchastity , ” is generic and so has given rise to much discussion . The widely accepted opinion among scholars today is that it was a technical term used by the Jewish Christian community to signify a degree of relationship that constituted an impediment to marriage according to the Law ( Lev 18:6-18 ; Acts 15:29 ) . - Matthew 5:33 What good is multiplying oaths between God and human beings ? Is this not a sign that lying and unbelief have perverted human realities ? In the kingdom of God , the dialogue between persons will rediscover its truth and its loyalty . - Matthew 5:38 The Old Testament commandment of an eye for an eye ( see Lev 24:20 ) was intended to moderate vengeance—seeking to ensure that the punishment not exceed the injury done . Jesus calls for further moderation and liberality by giving suggestions for breaking the infernal circle of hatred and disputation . - Matthew 5:43 Just as God invites the unrighteous to respond to him through the evidence of his love , so the disciples of Jesus must bear the same love toward their enemies . - Matthew 5:46 Tax collectors : those who collected taxes on behalf of the occupying authorities ; for this reason , and also because they engaged in fraud , they were regarded as public sinners . - Matthew 5:48 The life of the kingdom is that of children of God ; therein lies its secret and its demands ( see Lev 11:43 ; Deut 18:13 ) .

Matthew ’ s Sermon contains beatitudes or declarations of blessedness ( 5:1-12 ) , admonitions ( 5:13-20 ; 6:1-7 ,

NCB	Matthew	5	25	“ Come to terms quickly with your opponent while you are on the way to court with him . If you fail to do so , he may hand you over to the judge , and the judge will put you in the custody of the guard , and you will be thrown into prison .
NCB	Matthew	5	26	Believe the truth of what I tell you : you will not be given your freedom until you have paid your debt down to the last penny . [ h ]
NCB	Matthew	5	27	Adultery . [ i ] “ You have heard that it was said of old : ‘ You shall not commit adultery. ’
NCB	Matthew	5	28	But I say to you that anyone who looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart .
NCB	Matthew	5	29	If your right eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it away . It is preferable for you to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into Gehenna .
NCB	Matthew	5	30	And if your right hand causes you to sin , cut it off and throw it away . It is preferable for you to lose one of your limbs than to have your whole body thrown into Gehenna .
NCB	Matthew	5	31	Divorce. “ It has also been said : ‘ Whoever divorces his wife shall give her a certificate of dismissal. ’
NCB	Matthew	5	32	But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife , except if the marriage was unlawful , causes her to commit adultery , and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery .
NCB	Matthew	5	33	Oaths . [ j ] “ Again , you have heard that our ancestors were told : ‘ Do not swear falsely , but fulfill the vows you have made to the Lord. ’
NCB	Matthew	5	34	But what I tell you is this : Do not swear at all , either by heaven , since it is God ’ s throne ,
NCB	Matthew	5	35	or by earth , since that is his footstool , or by Jerusalem , since that is the city of the great King .
NCB	Matthew	5	36	Nor should you swear by your head , for you can not turn one hair of it white or black .
NCB	Matthew	5	37	All you need to do is to say ‘ Yes ’ if you mean ‘ Yes ’ and ‘ No ’ if you mean ‘ No. ’ Anything beyond this comes from the evil one .
NCB	Matthew	5	38	Retaliation . [ k ] “ You have heard that it was said : ‘ An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. ’
NCB	Matthew	5	39	But I say to you : Offer no resistance to someone who is wicked . If someone strikes you on your right cheek , turn and offer him the other cheek as well .
NCB	Matthew	5	40	If anyone wishes to sue you to gain possession of your tunic , give him your cloak as well .

NCB	Matthew	5	43	Love for Enemies . [ l ] “ You have heard that it was said : ‘ You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. ’
NCB	Matthew	5	44	But I say to you : Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you .
NCB	Matthew	5	45	This will make you children of your heavenly Father . For he causes his sun to rise on evil people as well as on those who are good , and his rain falls on both the righteous and the wicked .
NCB	Matthew	5	46	If you love only those who love you , what reward will you receive ? Do not even tax collectors [ m ] do the same ?
NCB	Matthew	5	47	And if you greet only your brethren , what about that is so extraordinary ? Even the pagans do as much .
NCB	Matthew	5	48	Perfection . [ n ] “ Therefore , strive to be perfect , just as your heavenly Father is perfect . Footnotes - Matthew 5:1 The Sermon on the Mount is the first of five great discourses in this Gospel ( chs . 5–7 ;
NCB	Matthew	5	1	Matthew here presents a catechism of Christian initiation and opposes it to the Jewish religious ideal . The ensemble of moral , social , religious , cultural , general , and collective requirements that holds good for the whole People of God was received by Moses on Mount Sinai . Jesus presents a new charter that he gives “ on the Mount ” ( 5:1 ) as if on a new Sinai . It does not take anything away from the Law but goes to the root of human conduct . Good intentions are not to replace act and obedience , but all that takes place in the heart and spirit of persons , their plans and their intentions , are already acts . - Matthew 5:1 The Beatitudes have been rightly termed “ Eight Words for Eternity. ” If we read them carefully , we will realize that the happiness proclaimed by Jesus is poles apart from what we habitually think , say , and do . In the first three Beatitudes are listed the faults that must be corrected if human beings are to be perfect—spiritual arrogance , pride , and desire for pleasure . In the next three Beatitudes are found the virtues that must regulate our relations with God , our neighbor , and ourselves—justice , mercy , and purity . In the last two Beatitudes , Christ urges his followers to be zealous in spreading the Gospel and peace , and he promises that they will be rewarded with honor and power in the kingdom of God for all that they have had to suffer for him . - Matthew 5:13 Only the certitude that God comes into our very midst can open up a horizon to our human condition . But where can we read the testimony of such a coming if not in the experience of the disciples ? We can not receive Jesus or discern the Father unless we strive to lead better lives . - Matthew 5:17 The Gospel of Matthew wants to stress the point that Jesus has no contempt for “ the Law or the Prophets ” ( = the Old Testament ) ; on the contrary , he takes them very seriously . But throughout his life he felt free to proclaim the true meaning of the Law by placing himself above even Moses . In his view , the Law is good , and there is nothing to discuss . In contrast to the commonly accepted rules , Jesus does not deal with secondary details ; the essentials , on the other hand , cause no problem ; therefore he does not discuss the Law . Instead , he goes farther and deeper , down into the human heart . - Matthew 5:18 Single letter : literally , iota ( Greek ) = Hebrew yod , the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet . Tiny portion of a letter : literally , the apex or tip of a letter , the bit that distinguishes similar letters . - Matthew 5:21 Murderers must appear before the highest Jewish judicial body , the Sanhedrin , and they deserve death and the fire , symbolized by Gehenna , the valley southwest of Jerusalem that was the center for an idolatrous cult during the monarchy in which children were offered in sacrifice ( see
NCB	Matthew	6	6	But when you pray , go into your room , close the door , and pray to your Father in secret . And your Father who sees everything that is done in secret will reward you . The Lord ’ s Prayer . [ b ]
NCB	Matthew	6	1	Tim 6:9 ) . - Matthew 6:16 Fasting is an action that evinces a desire to live more closely in the disinterested service of God ; this produces profound joy . The sole fast prescribed by the Mosaic Law was that of the Day of Atonement ( see Lev 16:31 ) , but in later Judaism fasting became a regular practice ( see Didache 9:1 ) . - Matthew 6:19 In this and the two following texts Jesus is responding to the faulty side of our way of thinking and acting . In order to affirm the primacy of God so simply and surely , we must live unceasingly in the presence of the Father . Those who guard their inner freedom , the desire for light , understand Jesus . But it is impossible to be open to God when desire for possessions has become the motivating force of one ’ s life . - Matthew 6:22 Those with good vision can readily direct their bodily movements . Similarly , those who utilize the prophetic vision of Christ can direct their way to God . - Matthew 6:24 Money : literally , “ Mammon ” ( an Aramaic word ) , a personification of wealth . - Matthew 6:25 Jesus warns us against making real human needs the object of overly anxious cares and thus becoming enslaved by them . The remedy for such an attitude is to seek first God ’ s kingdom and to show confidence in God ’ s providence .
NCB	Matthew	6	2	Therefore , whenever you give alms , do not trumpet your generosity , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets in order to win the praise of others . Amen , I say to you , they have already received their reward .
NCB	Matthew	6	3	But when you give alms , do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing .
NCB	Matthew	6	4	Your almsgiving must be done in secret . And your Father who sees everything that is done in secret will reward you . Praying in Secret .
NCB	Matthew	6	5	“ Whenever you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners so that others may observe them doing so . Amen , I say to you , they have already received their reward .
NCB	Matthew	6	7	“ When you pray do not go on babbling endlessly as the pagans do , for they believe that they are more likely to be heard because of their many words .
NCB	Matthew	6	8	Do not imitate them . Your Father knows what you need before you ask him .
NCB	Matthew	6	9	“ This is how you should pray : ‘ Our Father in heaven , hallowed be your name .
NCB	Matthew	6	10	Your kingdom come . Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
NCB	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day our daily bread .
NCB	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors .
NCB	Matthew	6	13	And do not lead us into temptation , [ c ] but deliver us from the evil one. ’
NCB	Matthew	6	14	If you forgive others for the wrongs they have done , your heavenly Father will also forgive you .
NCB	Matthew	6	15	But if you do not forgive others , then your Father will not forgive your transgressions .
NCB	Matthew	6	16	Fasting in Secret . [ d ] “ Whenever you fast , do not assume a gloomy expression like the hypocrites who contort their faces so that others may realize that they are fasting . Amen , I say to you , they have received their reward .
NCB	Matthew	6	17	But when you fast , put oil on your head and wash your face ,
NCB	Matthew	6	18	so that the fact that you are fasting will not be obvious to others but only to your Father who is hidden . And your Father who sees everything that is done in secret will reward you .
NCB	Matthew	6	19	Treasures in Heaven . [ e ] “ Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth , where they will be destroyed by moth and rust and where thieves break in and steal .
NCB	Matthew	6	20	Rather , store up treasure for yourselves in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves can not break in and steal .
NCB	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is , there will your heart also be .
NCB	Matthew	6	22	The Lamp of the Body . [ f ] “ The eyes are the lamp of the body . If your eyes are sound , your whole body will be filled with light .
NCB	Matthew	6	23	However , if your eyes are diseased , your whole body will be in darkness . If then the light within you is darkness , how great will that darkness be !
NCB	Matthew	6	24	God and Money. “ No one can serve two masters . For you will either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to the one and despise the other . You can not serve both God and money . [ g ]
NCB	Matthew	6	25	Seek First the Kingdom of God . [ h ] “ Therefore , heed my words . Do not be concerned about your life and what you will have to eat or drink , or about your body and what you will wear . Surely life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
NCB	Matthew	6	26	“ Gaze upon the birds in the sky . They do not sow or reap or store in barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them . Are you not of far greater value than they ?
NCB	Matthew	6	27	Can any of you through worrying add a single moment to your span of life ?
NCB	Matthew	6	28	“ And why are you concerned about what you are to wear ? Consider the lilies of the field and how they grow . They neither labor nor spin .
NCB	Matthew	6	29	Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his royal splendor was clothed like one of these .
NCB	Matthew	6	30	If God so clothes the grass of the field , which grows today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace , will he not all the more clothe you , O you of little faith ?
NCB	Matthew	6	31	“ Therefore , stop being anxious about such things . Do not say : ‘ What shall we eat ? ’ or ‘ What shall we drink ? ’ or ‘ What shall we wear ? ’
NCB	Matthew	6	32	These are things that are of concern to the Gentiles . Your heavenly Father is fully aware of all your needs .
NCB	Matthew	6	33	Rather , seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things will be given to you as well .
NCB	Matthew	6	34	“ So do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will take care of itself . Each day has enough troubles of its own . Footnotes - Matthew 6:1 Almsgiving ( vv . 2-4 ) , prayer ( vv . 5-15 ) , and fasting ( vv . 16-18 ) are characteristics of the Jewish religion , or of the “ righteous. ” Jesus does not teach other practices but is concerned with the spirit of our religious acts so that they may lead to God ’ s presence and bring the joy of being children of God . Believers do not vaunt themselves or make a show of their religion ; they listen to God . True religion is authentic spiritual life rather than spectacle and confusion or human respect . - Matthew 6:7 In response to a request from his disciples to teach them to pray ( see Lk 11:1 ) , Jesus entrusts them with the fundamental Christian prayer , the Our Father . It is also called the Lord ’ s Prayer because it comes to us from the Lord Jesus , the master and model of prayer . The Lord ’ s Prayer constitutes the summary of the whole Gospel , lies at the center of the Scriptures , and is the most perfect of prayers . The object of the first three petitions is the glory of the Father : the sanctification of his name , the coming of the kingdom , and the fulfillment of his will . The four others present our wants to him : they ask that our lives be nourished , healed of sin , and made victorious in the struggle of good over evil . - Matthew 6:13 Temptation : in the New Testament , temptation is a test in which Satan tries to destroy the believer . Consequently , it can not be attributed to God . God , however , can give the strength and means of overcoming it : this is the meaning of the petition . The Semitic expression “ do not lead us into ” is therefore to be understood as meaning “ do not allow us to enter into or succumb to temptation ” ( see Mt 26:41 ;
NCB	Matthew	7	7	“ Ask , and it will be given to you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and the door will be opened to you .
NCB	Matthew	7	1	“ Do not judge , so that you in turn may not be judged .
NCB	Matthew	7	2	For you will be judged in the same way that you judge others , and the measure that you use for others will be used to measure you .
NCB	Matthew	7	3	“ Why do you take note of the splinter in your brother ’ s eye but do not notice the wooden plank in your own eye ?
NCB	Matthew	7	4	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Let me remove that splinter from your eye , ’ while all the time the wooden plank remains in your own ?
NCB	Matthew	7	5	You hypocrite ! First remove the wooden plank from your own eye , and then you will be able to see clearly enough to remove the splinter from your brother ’ s eye . Do Not Profane Sacred Things . [ b ]
NCB	Matthew	7	6	“ Do not give to dogs anything that is holy . And do not cast your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet and then proceed to tear you to pieces . Ask , Seek , Knock . [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	7	8	For everyone who asks will receive , and those who seek will find , and to those who knock the door will be opened .
NCB	Matthew	7	9	“ Is there anyone among you who would give a stone to his son if he asks for bread ,
NCB	Matthew	7	10	or hand him a snake if he asks for a fish ?
NCB	Matthew	7	11	If you then , despite your evil nature , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
NCB	Matthew	7	12	The Golden Rule of Love . [ d ] “ In everything , deal with others as you would like them to deal with you . This is the Law and the Prophets .
NCB	Matthew	7	13	The Two Ways . [ e ] “ Enter through the narrow gate , for the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction , and those who enter through it are many .
NCB	Matthew	7	14	But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life , and those who find it are few in number .
NCB	Matthew	7	15	False Prophets and True Disciples . [ f ] “ Be on guard against false prophets who come to you disguised in sheep ’ s clothing , but who inwardly are ravenous wolves .
NCB	Matthew	7	16	By their fruits you will know them . Does one pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles ?
NCB	Matthew	7	17	In the same way , every good tree bears good fruit , but a rotten tree produces bad fruit .
NCB	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bear bad fruit , nor can a bad tree bear good fruit .
NCB	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .
NCB	Matthew	7	20	Thus , by their fruits you will know them .
NCB	Matthew	7	21	“ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only the one who does the will of my heavenly Father .
NCB	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me on that day , [ g ] ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name ? Did we not drive out demons in your name ? Did we not perform many miracles in your name ? ’
NCB	Matthew	7	23	Then I will tell them plainly , ‘ I never knew you . Depart from me , you evildoers ! ’
NCB	Matthew	7	24	The Wise and Foolish Builders . [ h ] “ Everyone who hears these words of mine and acts in accordance with them will be like a wise man who constructed his house on a rock foundation .
NCB	Matthew	7	25	The rain came down , the flood waters rose , and fierce winds battered that house . However , it did not collapse , because it had its foundations on rock .
NCB	Matthew	7	26	“ In contrast , everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act in accordance with them will be like a fool who constructed his house on a foundation of sand .
NCB	Matthew	7	27	The rain came down , the flood waters rose , and the winds blew and buffeted that house . And it collapsed with a great crash. ”
NCB	Matthew	7	28	The Authority of Jesus . [ i ] When Jesus had finished this discourse , the crowds were astounded at his teaching ,
NCB	Matthew	7	29	expresses the newness of the Gospel teaching . The scribes based their teaching on the Scriptures and on the instructions of their teachers . Jesus , on the other hand , speaks as a supreme legislator who has power to modify even the Scriptures . Jesus ’ astounding authority is not that of religious tradition ; it radiates from his person . He himself incarnates this “ new justice , ” this new mode of living and thinking that he teaches and establishes among human beings . Jesus ’ listeners could easily see the great difference between the kind of teaching of the scribes and Pharisees and that of Jesus with its total confidence and power .
NCB	Matthew	8	8	The centurion replied , “ Lord , I am not worthy to have you come under my roof . But simply say the word and my servant will be healed . [ e ]

NCB	Matthew	8	2	Pet 2:4 with
NCB	Matthew	8	3	He stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I do choose . Be made clean. ” Immediately , his leprosy was cured .
NCB	Matthew	8	4	Then Jesus said to him , “ See that you tell no one , but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses prescribed . That will be proof for them. ” Jesus Heals the Centurion ’ s Servant . [ d ]
NCB	Matthew	8	5	When Jesus entered Capernaum , a centurion approached him and pleaded for his help .
NCB	Matthew	8	6	“ Lord , ” he said , “ my servant is lying at home paralyzed and enduring agonizing sufferings. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	7	Jesus said to him , “ I will come and cure him. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	9	For I myself am a man subject to authority , with soldiers who are subject to me . I say to one ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another , ‘ Come here , ’ and he comes , and to my servant , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed , and he said to those who were following him , “ Amen , I say to you , in no one throughout Israel have I found faith as great as this .
NCB	Matthew	8	11	Many , I tell you , will come from the east and the west to sit with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob at the banquet in the kingdom of heaven .
NCB	Matthew	8	12	But the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	13	Jesus then said to the centurion , “ Return home . Your petition has been granted because of your faith. ” And at that very hour the servant was healed .
NCB	Matthew	8	14	Jesus Heals Peter ’ s Mother-in-Law . Jesus then entered the house of Peter and found Peter ’ s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever .
NCB	Matthew	8	15	He touched her hand and the fever left her , and she got up and began to serve him .
NCB	Matthew	8	16	Jesus Drives Out the Evil Spirits . [ f ] That evening they brought to him many who were possessed by demons . He cast out the spirits with a command and cured all who were sick .
NCB	Matthew	8	17	This was to fulfill the words of the prophet Isaiah : “ He took away our infirmities and bore our diseases. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	18	The Cost of Following Jesus . [ g ] When Jesus saw the great crowds around him , he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake .
NCB	Matthew	8	19	A scribe approached him and said , “ Teacher , I will follow you wherever you go. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	20	Jesus told him , “ Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man [ h ] has nowhere to lay his head. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	21	Another man , one of the disciples , said , “ Lord , allow me to go first and bury my father. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	22	Jesus answered him , “ Follow me , and let the dead bury their own dead. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	23	Jesus Calms the Storm . [ i ] He then got into the boat , followed by his disciples .
NCB	Matthew	8	24	Suddenly , a great storm came up on the lake , so that the boat was being swamped by the waves . But he was asleep .
NCB	Matthew	8	25	And so they went to him and awakened him , saying , “ Lord , save us ! We are going to die ! ”
NCB	Matthew	8	26	He said to them in reply , “ Why are you so frightened , O you of little faith ? ” Then he stood up and rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm .
NCB	Matthew	8	27	They were amazed and asked , “ What sort of man is this , whom even the winds and the sea obey ? ”
NCB	Matthew	8	28	Jesus Heals Two Demon-Possessed Men . [ j ] When he reached the region of the Gadarenes [ k ] on the other side of the lake , two men who were possessed by demons came out of the tombs and approached him . They were so fiercely violent that no one dared to pass that way .
NCB	Matthew	8	29	Suddenly , they shouted , “ What do you want with us , Son of God ? [ l ] Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time ? ”
NCB	Matthew	8	30	Some distance away a large herd of pigs was feeding .
NCB	Matthew	8	31	The demons pleaded with him , “ If you cast us out , send us into the herd of pigs. ”
NCB	Matthew	8	32	He said to them , “ Go , then ! ” They came out and entered the pigs . The entire herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and they perished in the water .
NCB	Matthew	8	33	Those tending the pigs ran off , and when they reached the town , they related the whole story including what had happened to the men who had been possessed .
NCB	Matthew	8	34	Then the whole town came out to meet Jesus , and when they saw him they begged him to leave their region . Footnotes - Matthew 8:1 This section gathers together ten accounts of miracles of Jesus . Interspersed among them are sayings of Jesus about discipleship . This has led some authors to speak of a portrayal of Jesus as “ Messiah of the Word ” in chs . 5–7 and “ Messiah of the Deed ” in 8–9 . By his sayings and actions Jesus bears witness that evil and sickness are no longer the last word for people , for human beings are not slaves of fate since the goodness of God is manifested in the goodness of Jesus . - Matthew 8:1 The ten miracle stories found herein are a third of the miracle stories that are told in detail in all the Gospels together . But the New Testament contains repeated references to a thaumaturgic activity that was continual ( see Mt 4:23 ; Lk 4:41 ; Acts 2:22 ) . - Matthew 8:1 Leprosy made a person ceremonially unclean as well as physically afflicted . The man with leprosy in this passage technically breaks the Law as he comes to prostrate himself at the feet of Jesus . The Master also breaks the Law when he touches the man and sovereignly decides to heal him . The sick man welcomes Christ ’ s word , and the kingdom is opened to him . He becomes a model and sign of the Christian made clean by Christ . - Matthew 8:5 Jesus commends a Roman centurion ( leader of a hundred soldiers ) for having greater faith than any Israelite and prophesies the ingathering of the Gentiles before healing his servant from afar . This passage shows that the great pilgrimage of peoples toward the kingdom has begun and evokes the beautiful image of the feast wherein all believers are definitively gathered together . Outside of this communion and joy there is only darkness ; the “ weeping and gnashing of teeth ” ( a phrase found outside Matthew only in Lk 13:28 ) describes the anguish of those who have remained insensitive to the call that has been welcomed by the very people they have denigrated . - Matthew 8:8 Lord , I am not worthy . . . will be healed : these words of the centurion have become those of believers who go to encounter the Lord in Holy Communion . - Matthew 8:16 Jesus is the Servant announced by Isa 53:4 who will expiate the sins of humankind . By the power of his Word he triumphs over the evil that keeps human beings in bondage symbolized by sickness . - Matthew 8:18 Jesus has subordinated family ties to the needs of his mission of salvation and requires the same sacrifice of those called to share that mission , while other members of the family can perform the deeds of filial piety . These are “ dead ” only in the sense that they have not received the same call to separate themselves from family responsibility in order to preach the Gospel of the kingdom . They can nonetheless be his disciples in another sense . Hence , following Jesus means Christians should be ready to make whatever sacrifice he asks of them . In the final analysis , they are followers of Christ , people who believe in him . They received faith in Christ at Baptism and are bound to serve him . By recourse to frequent prayer and true friendship with the Lord , they should strive to discover what Jesus asks of them in their service of him . - Matthew 8:20 Son of Man : the most common and enigmatic title of Christ used in the Gospels (
NCB	Matthew	8	81	times ) and in Acts 7:56—frequently by Christ himself . It was well suited to his purpose of both veiling and revealing his person and mission . On the one hand , it meant simply “ man ” ( see Ezek 2:1 ) and emphasized the lowliness of the human condition ( Mt 8:20 ; 11:19 ; 20:28 ) , especially in Christ ’ s humiliation and death ( Mt 17:22 ) . On the other hand , it expressed the triumph of Christ ’ s Resurrection ( Mt 17:9 ) , his return to glory ( Mt 24:30 ; Dan 7:13 ) , and his Second Coming as judge of the world ( Mt 25:31 ) . Christ made use of this title at his trial before the Sanhedrin ( Mt 26:64 ) when he prophesied that he would be vindicated and be seated in future glory at the right hand of God not merely as man but as Lord ( see Dan 7:13 ; Mk 14:62 ) . This title was employed by Jewish apocalyptic literature (
NCB	Matthew	9	9	As Jesus walked on from there , he noticed a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector ’ s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he got up and followed him .
NCB	Matthew	9	1	Thes 5:10 ) . Jesus does not deny the child ’ s death but indicates that she will arise from it as from a sleep . - Matthew 9:27 Son of David : a popular Jewish title for the Messiah who was to come ( e.g. , Mt 12:23 ; 20:30 ; 21:9 ; 22:41-45 ; see note on Mt 1:1 ) . - Matthew 9:34 The debate with the Pharisees on this claim will continue in Mt 12:25ff . - Matthew 9:35 As in Mt 4:23-25 , the evangelist concludes this part of his book with an action of Christ that shows compassion for the distress of the crowds and inculcates confidence in his followers . Jesus insistently works to impart the mercy of God upon all who come to him . He calls upon all who have the privilege of believing in him and benefiting from his salvation to share his concern for the misery of their neighbors . He seeks people who , like him and after him , will apply themselves to this task .
NCB	Matthew	9	2	Some people then approached him , carrying a paralyzed man lying on a bed . On perceiving their faith , Jesus said to the man , “ Take heart , son . Your sins are forgiven. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	3	On hearing this , some of the scribes said to themselves , “ This man is blaspheming. ” [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	9	4	Jesus perceived what they were thinking , and he said , “ Why do you harbor evil thoughts in your hearts ?
NCB	Matthew	9	5	[ d ] Which is easier , to say : ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say : ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
NCB	Matthew	9	6	But so that you may come to realize that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the paralyzed man— “ Stand up , take your bed , and go to your home. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	7	The man got up and returned to his home .
NCB	Matthew	9	8	When the crowd saw this , they were filled with awe , and they glorified God for having given such authority to men . Jesus Calls Matthew . [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	9	10	Jesus Dines with Sinners . When he was sitting at dinner in the house , many tax collectors [ f ] and sinners were seated with Jesus and his disciples .
NCB	Matthew	9	11	On seeing this , the Pharisees said to his disciples , “ Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”

NCB	Matthew	9	13	Go and learn what this text means : ‘ I desire mercy , not sacrifice. ’ I have come to call not the righteous but sinners. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	14	A Time of Joy and Grace . [ g ] Then the disciples of John came to him and asked , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not do so ? ”
NCB	Matthew	9	15	Jesus answered , “ How can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is still with them ? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast .
NCB	Matthew	9	16	“ No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak , because the patch eventually pulls away from the cloak and a worse tear results .
NCB	Matthew	9	17	Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins , for if they do , the wineskins burst , the wine spills forth , and the skins are ruined . Rather , they pour new wine into fresh wineskins . In this way both are preserved. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	18	Jesus Heals a Sick Woman and Raises a Dead Girl . [ h ] While he was saying these things to them , an official [ i ] came forward . He knelt before him and said , “ My daughter has just died . But if you come and lay your hand on her , she will live. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	19	Jesus then rose and followed him , together with his disciples .
NCB	Matthew	9	20	Suddenly , a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak .
NCB	Matthew	9	21	For she thought to herself , “ If only I touch his cloak , I shall be healed. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	22	Jesus turned and saw her , and he said , “ Take heart , daughter ! Your faith has healed you. ” And from that moment the woman was cured .

Crowd : mourners who were hired to wail and lament . - Matthew 9:24 Asleep : sleep is a metaphor for death ( see Ps 87:6 LXX ; Dan 12:2 ;
NCB	Matthew	9	24	he said , “ Go away ! The girl is not dead ; she is asleep , ” [ k ] but they laughed at him .
NCB	Matthew	9	25	When the people had been sent outside , he went in and took her by the hand , and the little girl stood up .
NCB	Matthew	9	26	And the news of this spread throughout the entire district .
NCB	Matthew	9	27	Jesus Heals Two Blind Men . As Jesus proceeded from there , two blind men followed him , crying out loudly , “ Son of David , [ l ] have pity on us. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	28	When he had gone indoors , the blind men approached him . Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe that I can do this ? ” They replied , “ Yes , Lord , we do. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	29	Then Jesus touched their eyes , saying , “ Let it be done for you according to your faith. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	30	And their sight was restored . Then Jesus sternly warned them , “ See to it that no one learns about this. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	31	But as soon as they had departed , they spread the news about him throughout that entire district .
NCB	Matthew	9	32	Jesus Heals a Mute Demoniac . As they left , a man who was possessed and unable to speak was brought to him .
NCB	Matthew	9	33	When the demon had been driven out , the man who had been mute was able to speak . The crowds were amazed , and they said , “ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel. ”
NCB	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees responded , “ He casts out demons by the prince of demons. ” [ m ]
NCB	Matthew	9	35	The Harvest Is Abundant . [ n ] Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the good news of the kingdom , and curing every kind of illness and disease .
NCB	Matthew	9	36	When he saw the crowds , he had compassion on them because they were distressed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd .
NCB	Matthew	9	37	Then he said to his disciples , “ The harvest is abundant , but the laborers are few .
NCB	Matthew	9	38	Therefore , ask the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers for his harvest. ” Footnotes - Matthew 9:1 The two preceding accounts have attested Jesus ’ power over the frightful forces of nature and the unchained powers of hell . Here Christ delivers human beings from sin itself . For the first time he proclaims the forgiveness of sins—which is an act of God . - Matthew 9:1 His hometown : Capernaum , which Jesus had made his headquarters . - Matthew 9:3 Blaspheming : i.e. , usurping God ’ s prerogative to forgive sins . - Matthew 9:5 Christ indicates that it is easier to heal a person physically than to heal him spiritually . It is easier to heal a broken leg than a broken heart . As Son of Man , in his human nature , Christ has the power to forgive sins . Therefore , he could also bestow it on his apostles ( see Mt 18:18 ; Jn 20:22 ) ; and just as they worked miracles only in his name ( see Acts 3:6 ) , they and their successors can forgive sins only in his name and by his authority . - Matthew 9:9 Jesus calls Matthew the tax collector to follow him , then eats at Matthew ’ s house together with “ many tax collectors ” and “ sinners. ” The Jews are shocked , but Jesus reminds them that it is the sick who need a doctor and God desires mercy rather than sacrifice . - Matthew 9:10 Tax collectors : see note on Mt 5:46 . - Matthew 9:14 The time when Jesus lived on earth was one of joy and grace . Later there would be a time for Jesus ’ disciples to fast , for the Bridegroom would be taken from them . In ancient times , goatskins were used to hold wine . As the wine fermented , it would expand and the new wineskins would stretch . But a used wineskin could not expand any more and would break . In the same way , the teaching that Jesus brings can not be kept in the old forms . - Matthew 9:18 Jesus rewards the faith of a father in distress and the trust of a sick and timid woman . He does not deceive those who believe him to be Master of the impossible . Human beings organize ceremonies of sorrow that are important in the East ( v.

Those who accept the Gospel will be at peace with God , but they will have to bear persecution at the hands of those who do not . - Matthew 10:38 Take up his cross : this is the first time Matthew mentions the cross , which was an instrument of death . The picture is of a man , already condemned , required to carry the beam of his own cross to the place of execution ( see Jn 19:17 ) . Here it symbolizes the necessity of total commitment—even unto death—on the part of Jesus ’ disciples . - Matthew 10:39 Those who renounce their earthly life in order to confess Jesus will obtain the happiness of eternal life . - Matthew 10:41 Prophet : the last prophet of the old covenant was John the Baptist .

NCB	Matthew	10	42	And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple , amen , I say to you , he will not go unrewarded. ” Footnotes - Matthew 10:1 This section of Matthew is called the Instructions to the Apostles ; collected in it are the texts describing the mission of the disciples , applicable to the early Church and for all future time . The disciples begin the great enterprise ; through them Christ ’ s authority and power continue among human beings—so long as they act truly in his Spirit and share his lot . Thus is born a new People of God . - Matthew 10:1 Israel was made up of twelve tribes ; the kingdom of Jesus was to have twelve founders ( see Mt 19:28 ; Rev 21:12-14 ) : the “ Twelve ” or the “ apostles. ” The latter is a Greek word ( plural ) meaning “ those who are sent ” ; Jesus himself chose the term ( Lk 6:13 ) . - Matthew 10:4 Iscariot : i.e. , “ Man from Kerioth , ” a place in the southernmost part of Palestine . - Matthew 10:5 Do not travel : the Good News about the kingdom was to be proclaimed first to Jews alone . After his Death and Resurrection , Jesus commanded the disciples to take the message to all nations ( Mt 28:19 ; see Mt 21:43 ) . Samaritans : a race of mixed blood resulting from the intermarriage of Israelites left behind when the people of the northern kingdom were exiled and Gentiles were brought into the land by the Assyrians (

NCB	Matthew	11	3	to ask him , “ Are you the one who is to come , [ d ] or are we to wait for another ? ”
NCB	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered them , “ Go back and tell John what you hear and see :
NCB	Matthew	11	5	the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , those who have leprosy are cured , the deaf hear , the dead are raised to life , and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them .
NCB	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me. ” [ e ] John Is the Elijah Who Was Destined To Return . [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	11	7	As John ’ s disciples were departing , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? A reed swaying in the wind ?
NCB	Matthew	11	8	Then what did you go out to see ? Someone robed in fine clothing ? Those who wear fine clothing are found in royal palaces .
NCB	Matthew	11	9	What then did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and far more than a prophet .
NCB	Matthew	11	10	This is the one about whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way before you. ’
NCB	Matthew	11	12	From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence , and the violent are taking it by force .
NCB	Matthew	11	13	For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until the arrival of John .
NCB	Matthew	11	14	And if you are willing to accept it , John is the Elijah who was destined to return .
NCB	Matthew	11	15	He who has ears to hear , let him hear !
NCB	Matthew	11	16	Indecisive Children . [ h ] “ To what shall I compare this generation ? It is like children who sit in the marketplace and call to one another :
NCB	Matthew	11	17	‘ We played the flute for you , but you would not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you refused to mourn. ’
NCB	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they said , ‘ He is possessed. ’
NCB	Matthew	11	19	The Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ‘ Look at him ! He is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ’ Yet wisdom is proved right by her actions. ”
NCB	Matthew	11	20	Woe to the Cities of Galilee . [ i ] Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his mighty deeds had been performed because they had refused to repent .
NCB	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! If the mighty deeds performed in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
NCB	Matthew	11	22	But I tell you , on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
NCB	Matthew	11	23	; Ezek 26–28 ; Zec 9:2-4 ) or wicked ( Sodom : Gen 18:16-19 ; Ezek 16:46-56 ) , which did not have the opportunity to witness Jesus ’ miracles and hear his preaching as had the people in most of Galilee . The people of Chorazin and Bethsaida have failed to recognize the presence of God in Jesus because they wanted to avoid penance . The same is true for the people of Capernaum , Jesus ’ headquarters on the north shore of Galilee ( see Mt 4:13 ) . - Matthew 11:25 The self-revelation of Jesus reached one of its high points in this moving prayer . It enables us to enter into the most hidden core of his life , into his innermost experiences . Between him and the Father there is an exchange of life , a profound and unique bond , a mutual commitment of their entire being—in short , an inexpressibly mysterious oneness . In the Bible , all this is summed up in the verb “ know. ” This is why Jesus alone can reveal to other human beings who the Father is for them . - Matthew 11:28 Yoke and burden evoke the Mosaic Law . The law of Christ is sweet , for it is not a list of customs , obligations , and conventions but primarily the sharing of a life , an apprenticeship of love .
NCB	Matthew	11	24	But I tell you , on the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you. ”
NCB	Matthew	11	25	The Self-Revelation of Jesus . [ j ] At that time , Jesus said , “ I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and have revealed them to children .
NCB	Matthew	11	26	Yes , Father , such has been your gracious will .
NCB	Matthew	11	27	“ All things have been entrusted to me by my Father . No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son wishes to reveal him .

NCB	Matthew	11	29	Take my yoke upon you and learn from me , for I am meek and humble of heart , and you will find rest for your souls .
NCB	Matthew	11	30	For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. ” Footnotes - Matthew 11:1 To be committed to Christ means to acknowledge him as the expected Messiah . By his words and his actions , he takes a clear position toward John and toward the Pharisees . To decide for Christ means to discover the inner life of Jesus . It is not right to proclaim the coming of the kingdom ; we are invited to experience it , to experience the power of God . The following passages enable us to question ourselves about our faith . - Matthew 11:1 In striking images John had proclaimed the time of wrath and the purification by God . Jesus himself had joined in this movement of renewal . Now the prophet is in prison , the victim of his mission . All around Jesus the enthusiasm of the crowds concerning John begins to falter . How then can they be made to acknowledge the awaited Messianic revolution consisting in the decisive judgment of the wicked and the liberation of the righteous ( Mt 3:12 ) ? But then who is the Messiah and what is the kingdom of God ? One must pass from questioning to decision , to the act of faith in Jesus . - Matthew 11:1 By letting John know that the announcement of the Prophets is being fulfilled ( Isa 26:19 ; 29:18 ; 35:5f ; 61:1 ) , Jesus reassures him and places him on guard against an overly human idea of the Messiah ; he encourages the Baptist to persevere in faith until the end . The kingdom of God is not to be confused with the accomplishment of our projects and our human victories ; it is a gift of God . - Matthew 11:3 The one who is to come : i.e. , the Messiah . Wait for another : it is not clear whether John is uncertain about Jesus or is simply sending his disciples to Jesus . - Matthew 11:6 Takes no offense at me : literally , “ is not scandalized , ” that is , for whom I am not a hindrance or stumbling block ( Greek : skandalon ) . It is from the idea of a stumbling block on the way of goodness that “ scandal ” derives its moral meaning , in both the active sense of giving scandal and the passive sense of taking scandal . In current idiom , a bad example is called “ scandalous ” when it causes a stir . - Matthew 11:7 Jesus eulogizes the strength of John the Baptist ’ s religious convictions , the austerity of his life ( v. 7f ) , and his unique prophetic role as precursor of the kingdom of God , which for Jesus is the salvation of human beings ( vv . 4-5 ) , not political revolution or the acquisition of power . - Matthew 11:11 John ’ s greatness consists primarily in his task of announcing the imminence of the kingdom of God ( Mt 3:1 ) . Yet to be a member of the kingdom is so sublime a privilege that even the least member is greater than the Baptist ! - Matthew 11:16 Indecisive children do not want to play either at a wedding when a flute is sounded or at a funeral when a dirge is sung ; such are the Jews who reject the salvation that God offers them : the severity of John frightens them and the goodness of Jesus shocks them . People often hesitate as much before joy as before repentance ! But the kingdom of God does not wait ; God realizes here below his plan—his “ Wisdom ” —as the acts of John and Jesus bear witness . - Matthew 11:20 The fate of the privileged cities of Chorazin ( about two miles from Capernaum ) and Bethsaida ( on the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee ) will be worse than that of cities traditionally regarded as godless ( Tyre and Sidon : Am 1:9f ;
NCB	Matthew	12	12	; Col 3:17 ; Jas 1:19 ; 3:1-12 ) . - Matthew 12:38 An opinion current among circles of apocalyptic thought at the time looked for the Messiah to perform a unique sign . Jesus offers only the sign of his Death and Resurrection typified by the story of Jonah in the belly of the whale ( Jon 2:1 ) . - Matthew 12:39 Adulterous : i.e. , in the spiritual sense of being unfaithful to the generation ’ s spiritual husband ( God ) . - Matthew 12:40 Three days and three nights : this manner of speaking denotes a common Jewish way of reckoning time and includes at least part of the first and part of the third day . Any part of the whole was counted as if it were the whole . Thus , even the time from Jesus ’ Death till sunset on Good Friday is counted as a day . ( The Old Testament depicted the Messiah as one who would suffer [ Ps
NCB	Matthew	12	1	Ki 10:1-3—a country in south-west Arabia now called Yemen ) were pagans who responded to lesser opportunities than the one that had been presented to Israel in the person of Jesus , one greater than Jonah or Solomon . - Matthew 12:43 A person ’ s religious history is a repeated exchange of good and evil . The option for evil can reach the point of taking full possession of the person . The same is true for the religious leaders of Israel . Just cleaning up one ’ s life without filling it with God leaves plenty of room for Satan to return . - Matthew 12:46 Belonging to Jesus has nothing to do with the bonds of blood relations . The Church is never based on attachments of race , class , or culture . She is the family of God . Only one who does the will of Jesus ’ heavenly Father belongs to his true family . - Matthew 12:46 His mother and his brethren : “ brethren ” here is used in the sense of “ cousins ” or “ relatives. ” If they were true brothers of Jesus , sons of Mary , the Gospel would say : “ his mother and the sons of his mother , ” which was the normal manner of speaking in Israel of that time . The Church has never wavered in her teaching that Mary was a Virgin and that Jesus was her only son , just as he is the only Son of the Father ( Lk 1:26 ) . In the ancient tongues of Hebrew , Arabic , and Aramaic , there were no concrete words to indicate the different types of relatives that exist in modern languages . In general , all who belonged to the same family clan , including tribes , were called “ brethren ” or “ sisters. ” ( See , for example , Jn 19:25 , which mentions a certain Mary , sister of Mary the Mother of Jesus . If they were really sisters , they would not bear the same name . Also note that in Mt 27:56 , the second Mary is called “ the mother of James and Joses ” [ i.e. , Joseph ] , two personages who are called “ brethren ” of the Lord in Mt 13:55 . ) In addition , in the first Christian community when the Gospels were written , there existed a very influential group composed of Jesus ’ relatives and his countrymen of Nazareth , called the “ brethren of the Lord. ” The leader seemed to be James , who became bishop of the Judean community . This group was late in believing in Jesus even though they had lived with him for several years ( Mk 3:21 ; Jn 7:3-5 ) . When speaking of them , the evangelists use the name the community gave them : “ brethren of the Lord ” or “ N . brother of Jesus. ” - Matthew 12:47 This verse is omitted in some mss .
NCB	Matthew	12	2	Pet 3:9 ) . Christ ’ s Redemption is super-abundant satisfaction for all sin and reaches every person ( Rom 5:12-21 ) . Christ gave his Church the power to forgive sins through the Sacraments of Baptism and Penance . This power is unlimited ; she can forgive every sin of the baptized as often as they confess with the necessary dispositions . - Matthew 12:33 Jesus denounces hypocrites whose words are vanity and calumny . Every spoken word reflects the heart ’ s overflow and is known to God . Hence words are critically important ( see Eph 5:3f ,
NCB	Matthew	12	3	[ d ] He answered , “ Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
NCB	Matthew	12	4	He entered the house of God and they ate the consecrated bread , which neither he nor his companions but only the priests were permitted to eat .
NCB	Matthew	12	5	[ e ] Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath , but they are considered to be without guilt ?
NCB	Matthew	12	6	I tell you , one greater than the temple is here .
NCB	Matthew	12	7	If you had truly understood what is meant by the words , ‘ I desire mercy and not sacrifice , ’ you would not have condemned these men who are without guilt .
NCB	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath. ” [ f ] The Man with a Withered Hand . [ g ]
NCB	Matthew	12	9	Moving on from that place , Jesus entered their synagogue .
NCB	Matthew	12	10	A man was there who had a withered hand , and hoping to find some reason to accuse Jesus they asked him , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath ? ”
NCB	Matthew	12	11	He said to them , “ Suppose you had only one sheep and it fell into a pit on the Sabbath . Would you not lay hold of it and lift it out ?
NCB	Matthew	12	13	Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He stretched it out , and it was restored , so that it was as sound as the other one .
NCB	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might put him to death . [ h ]
NCB	Matthew	12	15	The Servant of the Lord . [ i ] When Jesus became aware of this , he departed from that place . Many people followed him , and he healed all who were ill ,
NCB	Matthew	12	16	but he warned them not to make him known .
NCB	Matthew	12	17	This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah :
NCB	Matthew	12	18	“ Behold , my servant , whom I have chosen , my beloved in whom I delight . I will place my spirit upon him , and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
NCB	Matthew	12	19	He will not cry out or shout , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets .
NCB	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed he will not break , nor will he snuff out a smoldering wick , until he establishes justice as victorious ;
NCB	Matthew	12	21	and in his name the Gentiles will place their hope. ”
NCB	Matthew	12	22	; Isa
NCB	Matthew	12	23	All the people were astonished , and they said , “ Is this not the Son of David ? ” [ k ]
NCB	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ It is only by Beelzebul , [ l ] the prince of demons , that this man casts out demons. ”
NCB	Matthew	12	25	He knew what they were thinking , and he said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and every city or household divided against itself can not survive .
NCB	Matthew	12	26	If Satan drives out Satan , he is divided against himself . How then can his kingdom survive ?
NCB	Matthew	12	27	If it is by Beelzebul that I cast out demons , by whom do your own children cast them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
NCB	Matthew	12	28	But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
NCB	Matthew	12	29	“ Or again , how can anyone break into a strong man ’ s house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then indeed he can ransack the house .
NCB	Matthew	12	30	“ Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
NCB	Matthew	12	31	Therefore , I tell you that every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven .
NCB	Matthew	12	32	Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven , but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven , either in this age or in the age to come . [ m ]
NCB	Matthew	12	33	A Tree and Its Fruits . [ n ] “ Make a tree good and its fruit will be good , or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad . For a tree is known by its fruit .
NCB	Matthew	12	34	You brood of vipers ! How can your speech be virtuous when you yourselves are evil ? For the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart .
NCB	Matthew	12	35	A good man brings forth good things from the good stored up within him , but an evil man brings forth evil things from his store of evil .
NCB	Matthew	12	36	I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to render an account for every careless word they utter .
NCB	Matthew	12	37	For by your words you will be justified , and by your words you will be condemned. ”
NCB	Matthew	12	38	The Sign of Jonah . [ o ] Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him , “ Teacher , we would like you to show us a sign. ”
NCB	Matthew	12	39	categories of actions forbidden on the Sabbath , based on interpretations of the Law and Jewish customs . One of these was harvesting . By picking wheat and rubbing it in their hands , the disciples were technically harvesting according to the religious leaders . But the disciples were picking grain because they were hungry , not because they wanted to harvest the grain for profit . Hence , they were not working on the Sabbath . - Matthew 12:3 Each Sabbath
NCB	Matthew	12	40	For just as Jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of the whale , so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights . [ q ]
NCB	Matthew	12	41	[ r ] “ On the day of judgment the inhabitants of Nineveh will rise up with this generation and condemn it , for they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and now one greater than Jonah is here .
NCB	Matthew	12	42	On the day of judgment the queen of the south will rise up with this generation and condemn it , because she came from the farthest reaches of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and now one greater than Solomon is here .
NCB	Matthew	12	43	New Offensive from the Evil Spirit . [ s ] “ When an unclean spirit goes out of a person , it wanders through waterless regions seeking a place to rest , but it finds none .
NCB	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to the home from which I departed. ’ And when it returns , it finds that home empty , swept clean , and put in order .
NCB	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes off and brings back with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they enter and settle there . As a result , the plight of that person is worse than before . So it will also be with this evil generation. ”
NCB	Matthew	12	46	The True Family of Jesus . [ t ] While he was still speaking to the crowds , his mother and his brethren [ u ] appeared . They were standing outside , wishing to speak with him . [
NCB	Matthew	12	47	Someone told him , “ Behold , your mother and your brothers are standing outside . They want to speak with you. ” ] [ v ]
NCB	Matthew	12	48	But Jesus replied to that man , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brethren ? ”
NCB	Matthew	12	49	Then , pointing to his disciples , he said , “ Behold , my mother and my brethren .
NCB	Matthew	12	50	Whoever does the will of my heavenly Father is my brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Matthew 12:1 The Good News of the kingdom spreads from town to town ; a new law of salvation is announced and runs up against the refusal of those in authority . The conflict between Jesus and Judaism now appears inevitable . The newness of the Gospel totally upsets recognized habits of thinking and ways of acting . The more Jesus bypasses the Law for the service and salvation of human beings , the more he enters into conflict with his religious environment . Those who are close to Jesus are those who believe in him . - Matthew 12:1 Jesus reminds the Pharisees , who are attached to the letter of the Law , that a religion without love is worthless ( Hos 6:6 ) , and in order to make them face up to their blindness he cites an incident of the Old Testament ( David and his companions :
NCB	Matthew	12	53	] and rise from the dead on the third day [ Ps 16:9-11 ; Isa 53:10f ] . ) - Matthew 12:41 The people of Nineveh who repented ( see Jon 3:1-10 ) and the queen of the south ( i.e. , of Sheba—see
NCB	Matthew	13	13	The reason I speak to them in parables is that they see but do not perceive and they listen but do not hear or understand .
NCB	Matthew	13	1	) those who never accept the word of the kingdom ( v.
NCB	Matthew	13	2	) those who believe for a while but fall away because of persecution ( vv . 20-21 ) ; (
NCB	Matthew	13	3	) those who believe , but in whom the word is choked by worldly cares and the lure of riches ( v.
NCB	Matthew	13	4	) those who hear the word and produce an abundant crop ( v.
NCB	Matthew	13	5	Other seeds fell on rocky ground , where there was little soil . They sprouted quickly , since the soil had very little depth ,
NCB	Matthew	13	6	but when the sun rose they were scorched , and since they lacked roots , they withered away .
NCB	Matthew	13	7	Other seeds fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them .
NCB	Matthew	13	8	But some seeds fell on rich soil and produced a crop—some a hundred , some sixty , and some thirty times what was sown .
NCB	Matthew	13	9	He who has ears , let him hear ! ”
NCB	Matthew	13	10	The Reason for Parables . [ d ] Then his disciples approached and asked him , “ Why do you speak to them in parables ? ”
NCB	Matthew	13	11	He replied , “ To you has been granted knowledge of the mysteries [ e ] of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it has not been granted .
NCB	Matthew	13	12	To the one who has , more will be given , and he will have an abundance . As for the one who does not have , even what little he has will be taken away .
NCB	Matthew	13	14	In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah that says : ‘ You will indeed hear but not understand , you will indeed look but never see .
NCB	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s heart has become hardened ; they have stopped up their ears and they have shut their eyes , so that they might not see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and then turn to me , and I would heal them. ’
NCB	Matthew	13	16	The Privilege of Discipleship . [ f ] “ But blessed are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear .
NCB	Matthew	13	17	Amen , I say to you , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it .
NCB	Matthew	13	18	The Explanation of the Parable of the Sower . [ g ] “ Therefore listen to the parable of the sower .
NCB	Matthew	13	19	) ; (
NCB	Matthew	13	20	As for the seed sown on rocky ground , this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy .
NCB	Matthew	13	21	But such a person has no deep root , and he endures for only a short time . When some trouble or persecution arises on account of the word , he immediately falls away .
NCB	Matthew	13	22	) ; and (
NCB	Matthew	13	23	) . - Matthew 13:24 The parable of the weeds is proper to Matthew . Through it Jesus teaches that the Last Judgment ( of which the “ harvest ” is a common metaphor ) , i.e. , the separation of the good from the wicked , is to be awaited with patience . The explanation is given in Mt 13:37-43 . - Matthew 13:25 Weeds : probably darnel , which looks very much like wheat while it is young , but can later be distinguished . - Matthew 13:31 The mustard seed is the smallest one used by the Palestinian farmers and gardeners of that day , but it could reach a height of some ten or twelve feet . Thus , the kingdom of heaven , notwithstanding the humble ministry of Jesus , is already dawning and in the end will be shown in all its magnificence . - Matthew 13:32 Tree . . . its branches : an allusion to Dan 4:21 , indicating that the kingdom of heaven will become worldwide and people from all nations will find refuge therein ( see also Ezek 17:23 ; 31:6 ; Dan 2:35 , 44f ; 7:27 ; Rev 11:15 ) . - Matthew 13:33 The parable of the yeast is an invitation to faith in the efficacy of the ministry of Jesus . Despite its modest and unspectacular character , it constitutes a stage in the eschatological coming of the kingdom of God . The greatness of the kingdom is shown by the enormous amount of flour , enough to feed well over a hundred people . - Matthew 13:34 Matthew stresses that Jesus speaks in parables to reveal God and his kingdom ; in this way he shows that the Messiah fulfills the Scriptures . The “ prophet ” is , in this case , the psalmist ( see Ps 78:2 ) . - Matthew 13:36 The explanation of the parable of the weeds stresses the Last Judgment in which Christ and those who have believed in him will triumph over the forces of evil . It thus teaches one to be converted without delay and to remain steadfast in faith till the end . - Matthew 13:44 The parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl reveal the hidden character of the kingdom of heaven and its great worth . It represents the supreme value to which human beings must aspire . - Matthew 13:47 The parable of the net repeats the teaching of the parable of the weeds , with its emphasis upon the final exclusion of the wicked from the kingdom . It thus calls for an authentic conversion on the part of the listeners . - Matthew 13:51 To those who believe , the parables reveal God ’ s mysterious plan for human beings . Thus , the teacher of the law , the scribe , once he has become a disciple , knows how to see the link between the Old and the New Testaments and is enriched by their basic harmony . - Matthew 13:53 A new and tragic phase in the life of Jesus , and therefore also in the life of the kingdom , begins here and illustrates the accounts and words of this fourth part of the Gospel . The drama is infused with a growing intensity . Christ hides himself from the enthusiasm of the crowds who want him to embrace their hope for national freedom . This stirs up hostility and leads to defection . The kingdom that he proclaims is suspect in the eyes of the defenders of legalism and traditions ; not even his disciples have a good understanding of the life that he teaches . Powerless , they live under this tension , which prepares for the Passion , and their incredulity will even contribute to it ; but they still remain the core of the new community of believers . - Matthew 13:53 The main purpose of this section is to place the Person of Jesus at the center of the mystery of the kingdom of God . The evangelist shows Jesus receiving a mixed reception , beginning with his rejection at Nazareth and the execution of the Baptist ( Mt 13:53—14:12 ) . He then alludes to the Eucharistic mystery in the accounts of the multiplication of the loaves ( Mt 14:19 ; 15:36 ) , and the walking on the water ( Mt 14:22-33 ) . Finally , he reports the doctrinal conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities ( Mt 15:1-20 ) and raises anew the question of the sign of Jonah ( Mt 16:1-4 ; see note on Mt 12:38ff ) . This sign will later be explained as referring to the Passion , Death , and Resurrection of Jesus ( Mt 16:21ff ) , which must occur before the kingdom of God reaches a new stage ( Mt 16:28 ) . This is the message of the Scriptures ( Mt 17:5 ) . - Matthew 13:53 At Nazareth , everyone knows the mother of Jesus and his brothers and sisters , i.e. , his closest relatives , as it was customary to say in those days ( see note on Mt 12:46 ) . He thus has his place in this little village . But how can the villagers be expected to acknowledge the Messiah in one of their compatriots ? God ’ s action and word manifested among men is the mystery of the Incarnation ; this seems too human . Even the believer might hesitate in believing in the Lord present among us , in the places and times in which daily life unfolds .
NCB	Matthew	13	24	The Parable of the Weeds . [ h ] He then proposed another parable to them : “ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field .
NCB	Matthew	13	25	While everyone was asleep , his enemy came , sowed weeds [ i ] among the wheat , and then went away .
NCB	Matthew	13	26	When the wheat sprouted and ripened , the weeds also appeared .
NCB	Matthew	13	27	and in the Dead Sea Scrolls to designate a divine plan or decree affecting the course of history that can be known only when revealed . In this case , the secret or mystery is that the kingdom is already present in the ministry of Jesus . - Matthew 13:16 The disciples , unlike the unbelieving crowds , have seen and heard what many prophets and righteous people of the Old Testament longed to see . . . and to hear without having their longing filled . - Matthew 13:18 It is not enough for us to hear the word ; we must accept it with all its demands so that it may transform our existence . The four types of persons described in the parable are : (
NCB	Matthew	13	28	He answered , ‘ One of my enemies has done this. ’ The servants then asked him , ‘ Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds ? ’
NCB	Matthew	13	29	“ He replied , ‘ No , because in gathering the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them .
NCB	Matthew	13	30	parables . John ’ s Gospel contains no parables but makes good use of other figures of speech . - Matthew 13:3 At this period , seed was scattered everywhere on as yet uncultivated ground , before any plowing was done and without the sower having a clear idea of whether it would take root . Some seed was wasted , but the sower was not discouraged , knowing that the harvest would come and this was all that counted . In the Old Testament , the harvest was a symbol of the Messianic age ( see Ps 126:5-6 ; Am 9:13 ) . - Matthew 13:10 The parables make use of a language that is clear and rich for those whose heart is open but obscure and deceptive for those whose heart is closed . Already Jesus sees the new community , where his message is richness of life , separating itself from official Judaism , which will lose even that which it has , i.e. , its role as custodian of God ’ s Covenant . The Word of Christ always works in a twofold way ; it fills those who accept it but leads to the hardening up of those who refuse it . - Matthew 13:11 Mysteries : also translated as “ secrets. ” The word is used in Dan 2:18 ,
NCB	Matthew	13	31	The Parable of the Mustard Seed . [ j ] He proposed still another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field .
NCB	Matthew	13	32	It is the smallest of all the seeds , but when it has grown it is the greatest of plants and becomes a tree large enough for the birds to come and make nests in its branches. ” [ k ]
NCB	Matthew	13	33	The Parable of the Yeast . [ l ] And he offered them yet another parable : “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it was completely leavened. ”
NCB	Matthew	13	34	The Use of Parables . [ m ] Jesus told the crowds all these things in parables . Indeed he never spoke to them except in parables .
NCB	Matthew	13	35	This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet : “ I will open my mouth to speak in parables ; I will proclaim what has been hidden since the foundation of the world. ”
NCB	Matthew	13	36	Explanation of the Parable of the Weeds . [ n ] Then he dismissed the crowds and went into the house . His disciples approached him and said , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field. ”
NCB	Matthew	13	37	He answered , “ The one who sows good seed is the Son of Man .
NCB	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world , and the good seed stands for the children of the kingdom . The weeds are the children of the evil one ,
NCB	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sowed them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the world , and the reapers are angels .
NCB	Matthew	13	40	“ Just as the weeds are collected and burned in the fire , so will it be at the end of the world .
NCB	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send forth his angels , and they will gather out of his kingdom all who cause sin and all whose deeds are evil .
NCB	Matthew	13	42	They will throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
NCB	Matthew	13	43	Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He who has ears to hear , let him hear !
NCB	Matthew	13	44	The Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl . [ o ] “ The kingdom of heaven is like treasure buried in a field , which a man found and buried again . Then in his joy he went off and sold everything he had and bought that field .
NCB	Matthew	13	45	“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls .
NCB	Matthew	13	46	When he found one of great value , he went off and sold everything he had and bought it .
NCB	Matthew	13	47	The Parable of the Net . [ p ] “ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea where it caught fish of every kind .
NCB	Matthew	13	48	When it was full , they hauled it ashore . Then they sat down and collected the good fish into baskets but discarded those that were worthless .
NCB	Matthew	13	49	Thus will it be at the end of the world . The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous
NCB	Matthew	13	50	and throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
NCB	Matthew	13	51	Conclusion . [ q ] “ Have you understood all this ? ” he asked . They answered , “ Yes. ”
NCB	Matthew	13	52	Then he said to them , “ Therefore , every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings forth from his storeroom new treasures as well as old. ” The Authentic Faith of Those Converted [ r ] Jesus Encounters Mixed Receptions [ s ]
NCB	Matthew	13	53	Jesus Is Rejected at Nazareth . [ t ] When Jesus had finished these parables , he departed from that district .
NCB	Matthew	13	54	He came to his hometown , and he began to teach the people in the synagogue . They were astonished and wondered , “ Where did this man get such wisdom and these mighty deeds ?
NCB	Matthew	13	55	Is this not the carpenter ’ s son ? Is not his mother called Mary ? Are not James and Joseph and Simon and Judas his brethren ?
NCB	Matthew	13	56	And are not all his sisters here with us ? Where then did this man get all this ? ”
NCB	Matthew	13	57	And so they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is always treated with honor except in his hometown and in his own house. ”
NCB	Matthew	13	58	And he did not work many mighty deeds there because of their lack of faith . Footnotes - Matthew 13:1 This is the beginning of the Third Discourse in Matthew ’ s Gospel , which includes seven parables of Jesus about the kingdom of heaven , a plan hidden in God and only incompletely manifested to us ( 13:10-17 , 34f ; see Eph 3:4ff ) . Each parable presents a different aspect of the kingdom and helps us to perceive the multifaceted reality that is growing among us throughout history . However , there is no point in looking for a meaning in every detail of a parable ; it is more profitable to look for the essential message . - Matthew 13:3 Parables : stories that are illustrative comparisons between religious truths and events of everyday life . Those told by Jesus are so living , direct , and natural as to be unforgettable . They bear witness to a true poetic and pedagogical genius . The Synoptic Gospels contain some
NCB	Matthew	14	14	When he came ashore and saw the vast crowd , he had compassion on them and healed those who were sick .
NCB	Matthew	14	1	) sunset–10:00 P.M. , (
NCB	Matthew	14	2	) 10:00 P.M–2:00 A.M. , (
NCB	Matthew	14	3	) 2:00–sunrise . Apparently , the apostles labored for several hours against the storm waves . Their enthusiasm of the previous evening for an overly earthly Messianism had greatly evaporated in the face of hard labor and the fear of being shipwrecked . - Matthew 14:33 Son of God : the apostles probably used this title in a Messianic way ( see Mt 3:17 ; 11:25-30 ) but with superficial understanding . Since Jesus ’ divine nature was hidden during his life on earth , the disciples did not yet grasp his divinity at this time ( Phil 2:5-8 ) . But they were beginning to realize that he was the Messiah . - Matthew 14:34 Gennesaret : the plain northwest of the lake of the same name .
NCB	Matthew	14	4	) 3:00–6:00 A.M . The Jews divided the night into three watches : (
NCB	Matthew	14	5	Herod wanted to put John to death , but he was afraid of the people because they regarded John as a prophet .
NCB	Matthew	14	6	) . - Matthew 14:19 Note the resemblance of this verse to that of the institution of the Eucharist ( Mt 26:26 ) . Obviously in the eyes of the primitive Church this meal was a prelude and prefiguration of the Eucharistic banquet , which in its turn recalls the Messianic banquet . Particularly allusive are the breaking of the bread and the action of the disciples in distributing the bread . - Matthew 14:21 In addition to women and children : women and children were not permitted to eat with men in public . Hence they were in a place by themselves and would greatly increase the number given for the men :
NCB	Matthew	14	7	that he promised with an oath to give her anything she asked for .
NCB	Matthew	14	8	Prompted by her mother , she said , “ Give me here the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ”
NCB	Matthew	14	9	The king was distressed , but because of his oaths and the guests present there , he ordered that her request be granted .
NCB	Matthew	14	10	He had John beheaded in the prison . [ d ]
NCB	Matthew	14	11	The head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl , who took it to her mother .
NCB	Matthew	14	12	John ’ s disciples came and removed the body and buried it . Then they went and told Jesus .
NCB	Matthew	14	13	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand Men . [ e ] When Jesus received this news , he withdrew from there in a boat by himself to a deserted place , but when the people learned of it , they followed him on foot from the towns . [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	14	15	When evening approached , the disciples came up to him and said , “ This is a deserted place and the hour is now late . Send the people away now so that they can go to the villages to buy some food for themselves. ”
NCB	Matthew	14	16	) ; he acts like the great men of God such as Elisha (
NCB	Matthew	14	17	But they answered , “ All we have here are five loaves of bread and two fish. ”
NCB	Matthew	14	18	Jesus said , “ Bring them here to me. ”
NCB	Matthew	14	19	Then he ordered the people to sit down on the grass . Taking the five loaves and the two fish , he looked up to heaven , blessed and broke the loaves , and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the crowds . [ g ]
NCB	Matthew	14	20	They all ate and were satisfied . Then they gathered up the fragments that were left over—twelve full baskets .
NCB	Matthew	14	21	Those who had eaten numbered about five thousand men , in addition to women and children . [ h ]
NCB	Matthew	14	22	Jesus Walks on the Water . [ i ] Then Jesus instructed the disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he dismissed the crowds .
NCB	Matthew	14	23	After he sent them away , he went by himself up on the mountain to pray . When evening came , he was there alone .
NCB	Matthew	14	24	Meanwhile , the boat was already some distance from the shore , battered by waves and a strong wind .
NCB	Matthew	14	25	During the fourth watch [ j ] of the night , Jesus came toward them , walking on the water .
NCB	Matthew	14	26	When the disciples saw him walking on the water they were terrified , and they cried out in their fright , “ It is a ghost ! ”
NCB	Matthew	14	27	But Jesus immediately spoke to them , saying , “ Have courage ! It is I . Do not be afraid. ”
NCB	Matthew	14	28	Peter answered , “ Lord , if it is you , command me to come to you across the water. ”
NCB	Matthew	14	29	in the fortress of Machaerus , east of the Dead Sea , as is attested by Flavius Josephus . - Matthew 14:13 Exegetes have named this the “ Section of the Loaves ” because of the frequency with which the word “ bread ” is used therein . It seems to symbolize the teaching and salvific acts of Jesus , with a particular reference to the founding of the Church . - Matthew 14:13 At the time of the temptation in the desert , Jesus had refused to renew the miracle of the manna either for himself or to attain his own success . Moreover , six times in the Gospels ( two of which are in Matthew ) we read an account like this one . Thus , the first generation of Christians attached a particular importance to the deed . It is first of all an act of mercy , a sign of the goodness of God , who satisfies material and spiritual hunger at the last days . It is also the manifestation of Jesus as the new Moses , as the new founder of the people—he too feeds the crowd in the desert ( Ex
NCB	Matthew	14	30	But when he realized the force of the wind , he became frightened . As he began to sink , he cried out , “ Lord , save me ! ”
NCB	Matthew	14	31	Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught hold of him , saying , “ O you of little faith , why did you doubt ? ”
NCB	Matthew	14	32	After they got into the boat , the wind died down .
NCB	Matthew	14	33	Those in the boat fell to their knees in worship , saying , “ Truly you are the Son of God. ” [ k ]
NCB	Matthew	14	34	Jesus Heals the Sick at Gennesaret . After they had completed the crossing , they landed at Gennesaret . [ l ]
NCB	Matthew	14	35	When the people there recognized him , they sent word of his presence throughout the region . They also brought him all those who were sick
NCB	Matthew	14	36	and begged him to let them touch only the edge of his cloak . All who touched it were completely healed . Footnotes - Matthew 14:1 At the ominous banquet in the fortress of Machaerus we find various members of the family of Herod . Antipas was the second-born of Herod the Great and ruled over Galilee and Perea . We come upon him several times in the New Testament ( Lk 9:7 ; 23:7 ; Acts 4:27 ) ; Caligula will exile him to Gaul in A.D.
NCB	Matthew	14	39	. His half-brother Philip died in Rome without ever attaining political power . Herodias , niece of both men and wife of Philip , was ambitious and desired to be the wife of a ruler . - Matthew 14:1 Tetrarch : ruler of one quarter of the kingdom of his father , Herod the Great . - Matthew 14:6 The daughter of Herodias : her name was Salome , as we are told by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus . - Matthew 14:10 The beheading of the Baptist probably occurred in A.D.
NCB	Matthew	14	5000	! - Matthew 14:22 For people of the Bible , raging waves and the dead of night evoke the forces hostile to God and his faithful . In calming the storm , Jesus has manifested himself as the master of the powers of evil . To follow him means to escape from their clutches . This is a dangerous path at times in which we must risk everything for him because it is he . “ It is I , ” he says , and in these words any Christian , after the Ascension and Resurrection , would detect echoes of “ I am , ” the decisive self-disclosure of God ( Ex 3:14 ; Isa 43:10 ; 51:12 ) . In Peter himself , the first among the disciples , we discern the drama of every believer : strong when he entrusts himself totally to the Lord , yet threatened and uncertain when he does not take refuge in him alone . - Matthew 14:25 Fourth watch : 3:00–6:00 A.M . The Romans divided the night into four watches : (
NCB	Matthew	15	15	Peter said to him , “ Explain that parable to us. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	1	Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked ,
NCB	Matthew	15	2	[ a ] “ Why do your disciples ignore the tradition of the elders ? They do not wash their hands before eating. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	3	He answered them , “ And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition ?
NCB	Matthew	15	4	For God said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death. ’
NCB	Matthew	15	5	But you say , ‘ If anyone says to his father or mother , “ Anything I might have used for your support is dedicated to God , ”
NCB	Matthew	15	6	then he is excused from his duty to honor his father or mother. ’ To uphold your tradition you have made God ’ s word null and void .
NCB	Matthew	15	7	You hypocrites ! How rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you when he said :
NCB	Matthew	15	8	‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me ;
NCB	Matthew	15	9	in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. ’ ”
NCB	Matthew	15	10	Clean and Unclean . [ b ] Then he called the people to him and said to them , “ Listen and understand .
NCB	Matthew	15	11	It is not what goes into one ’ s mouth that defiles a person ; what comes out of the mouth is what defiles him. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	12	The disciples approached and said to him , “ Do you realize that the Pharisees were greatly offended when they heard what you said ? ”
NCB	Matthew	15	13	He answered , “ Every plant that my Father has not planted will be uprooted .
NCB	Matthew	15	14	Leave them alone . They are blind guides . And if one blind person guides another , they will both fall into a pit. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	16	Jesus replied , “ Are even you still without understanding ?
NCB	Matthew	15	17	Do you not realize that whatever goes into the mouth passes through the stomach and is discharged into the sewer ?
NCB	Matthew	15	18	But what comes out of the mouth originates in the heart , and this is what defiles a person .
NCB	Matthew	15	19	For from the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , fornication , theft , perjury , slander .
NCB	Matthew	15	20	These are the things that defile a person , but to eat with unwashed hands does not make anyone unclean. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	21	The Faith of a Pagan Woman . [ c ] Jesus then left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon . [ d ]
NCB	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a Canaanite woman from that region came out to meet him and cried out , “ Have pity on me , Lord , Son of David . My daughter is sorely tormented by a demon. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	23	But he did not say a word to her in reply . So his disciples came and urged him , “ Send her away , for she keeps shouting after us. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	24	He answered , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	25	But she came and knelt at his feet , saying , “ Lord , help me ! ”
NCB	Matthew	15	26	He answered , “ It is not right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	27	She replied , “ Yes , Lord , but even the dogs eat the scraps that fall from their masters ’ table. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered her , “ Woman , you have great faith . Let it be done for you as you wish. ” And from that moment her daughter was healed .
NCB	Matthew	15	29	Jesus Heals Many People . [ e ] After leaving that region , Jesus walked along the shores of the Sea of Galilee , and going up onto the mountain , he sat down .
NCB	Matthew	15	30	Large crowds flocked to him , bringing with them the lame , the blind , the deformed , the mute , and many others . They placed them at his feet , and he cured them .
NCB	Matthew	15	31	The crowds were amazed when they observed the mute speaking , the crippled made whole , the lame walking , and the blind with their sight restored , and they gave praise to the God of Israel .
NCB	Matthew	15	32	Jesus Feeds Four Thousand Men . Jesus called his disciples to him and said , “ I am moved with compassion for these people , because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away hungry , or they may collapse on the way. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	33	The disciples said to him , “ Where can we ever get enough bread in this deserted place to feed such a great crowd ? ”
NCB	Matthew	15	34	Jesus asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” “ Seven , ” they replied , “ and a few small fish. ”
NCB	Matthew	15	35	He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground .
NCB	Matthew	15	36	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples , and the disciples gave them to the people .
NCB	Matthew	15	37	They all ate and were satisfied . Afterward , they picked up seven baskets full of what remained .
NCB	Matthew	15	38	Those who had eaten numbered four thousand men , not counting women and children .
NCB	Matthew	15	39	And when he had sent away the crowds , he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan . Footnotes - Matthew 15:2 The “ oral ” tradition consisted of practices and regulations meant to fill out the written Law of Moses ; many Pharisaic Jews did not hesitate to claim that this tradition , like the Torah , had been revealed on Sinai . The oral tradition allowed for a vow by which a man could free himself from his obligations to his own parents : the material goods meant for them were promised to God and thus declared “ sacred offerings. ” - Matthew 15:10 Every ancient religion attempted to distinguish clearly the two notions of clean and unclean as regards objects and affairs of life . The Book of Leviticus proposes a developed code of ritual purity , which was above all a way of expressing the grandeur of God and of establishing laws of respect in the behavior of human beings . However , as time went on , this great inspiration was lost in a soulless formalism . In the tightly regulated life of the Jews of the first century A.D. , the dispositions of the heart held such a small place that even the apostles have trouble understanding the teaching of Jesus . He unmasks hypocrisy . How can one not be shocked by his words , which overturn even the religious assurance of humans ! - Matthew 15:21 The Israelites regarded themselves as children of God because they were heirs of the promises made to the patriarchs and depositaries of the divine revelation . On the contrary , they called the Gentiles dogs out of contempt for their idolatrous and immoral practices . Jesus makes use of these two terms but softens the second , which in the Greek is “ little dogs , ” i.e. , pet dogs in the home . His point was that the Gospel was to be offered first to the Jews . The woman understood his implication and was willing to settle for the “ crumbs. ” Jesus rewarded her faith . - Matthew 15:21 Tyre and Sidon : these were Phoenician cities ; Canaanite was the ancient name of their populations . - Matthew 15:29 This second miracle of the loaves has many analogies with the first multiplication of the loaves . Therefore , some exegetes speak of a duplication , i.e. , a different reporting of the same episode . However , there are so many diverse circumstances in the two episodes that Matthew and Mark believe in two distinct miracles .
NCB	Matthew	16	16	Simon Peter replied , “ You are the Christ , the Son of the living God. ” [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	16	1	Cor 1:12 ; Gal 1:18 ) , and is translated as “ Peter ” in Jn 1:42 . Church : a word that occurs only here and in Mt 18:17 ( twice ) in the New Testament . The Church will have Peter as her foundation stone . But of course her real foundation is faith in Jesus , the Son of God . Peter will have the primacy among all the apostles and be the visible head of the Church , as will his successors , the Popes . The gates of the netherworld designate the powers of death . The Church will resist all the vicissitudes of time because of her foundation on a rock . - Matthew 16:19 Receiving the power of the keys , symbol of authority , Peter becomes Christ ’ s representative on earth . He is given the power to bind and loose , i.e. , to condemn or absolve , to prohibit or allow . Peter is the doorkeeper ( Mk 13:34 ) but not the Teacher or the Father ( Mt 23:9-10 ) . - Matthew 16:20 Not to tell : since the Jews were looking for a national and political Messiah , Jesus urged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah . - Matthew 16:21 The apostles now knew that Jesus was the Messiah , but their idea of it was inexact . They thought of a political Messiah , the glorious dominator of peoples . Jesus offers a triple prediction that spells out the last stages of his ministry . He thus prepares them for the scandal of the cross ( see Mt 17:22f ; 20:17f ) and enlightens them concerning the true Messianism , which is spiritual , humble , and suffering . - Matthew 16:22 Peter unknowingly offers Jesus the facile and worldly Messianism that would put him in opposition to the will of the Father . He unwittingly repeats the temptation of Satan at the beginning of Christ ’ s ministry ( Mt 4:1-11 ) . - Matthew 16:25 In order to receive eternal life , one must be ready to bear any sacrifice—even the renunciation of earthly life . The Greek word for “ life ” means either “ life ” or “ soul ; ” also in v.
NCB	Matthew	16	2	He answered them , “ When it is evening , you say , ‘ Tomorrow there will be fair weather , for the sky is red , ’
NCB	Matthew	16	3	and in the morning you say , ‘ It will be stormy today , for the sky is red and threatening. ’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky , but you can not interpret the signs of the times .
NCB	Matthew	16	4	An evil and adulterous [ b ] generation asks for a sign , but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ” Then he left them and went away . The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	16	5	In crossing to the other side of the lake , the disciples had forgotten to bring bread .
NCB	Matthew	16	6	Jesus said to them , “ Be careful , and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
NCB	Matthew	16	7	They talked about this among themselves and concluded : “ It is because we brought no bread. ”
NCB	Matthew	16	8	Aware of what they were saying , Jesus said , “ O you of little faith , why are you talking about having no bread ?
NCB	Matthew	16	9	Do you still not understand ? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand and the number of baskets you collected ?
NCB	Matthew	16	10	Or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many baskets you gathered ?
NCB	Matthew	16	11	How could you fail to see that I was not speaking about bread when I said , ‘ Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees ’ ? ”
NCB	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the yeast used in bread but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees .
NCB	Matthew	16	13	Peter ’ s Confession of Christ ’ s Divinity . [ d ] When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi , [ e ] he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
NCB	Matthew	16	14	They replied , “ Some say John the Baptist ; others , Elijah ; and still others , Jeremiah or one of the Prophets. ”
NCB	Matthew	16	15	“ But you , ” he said to them , “ who do you say that I am ? ”
NCB	Matthew	16	17	Then Jesus said to him in reply , “ Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah . For flesh and blood [ g ] has not revealed this to you but my heavenly Father .
NCB	Matthew	16	18	And I say to you : You are Peter , and on this rock I will build my Church , [ h ] and the gates of the netherworld will not prevail against it .
NCB	Matthew	16	19	I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven . Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ” [ i ]
NCB	Matthew	16	20	Then he gave the disciples strict orders not to tell [ j ] anyone that he was the Christ .
NCB	Matthew	16	21	Jesus Predicts His Passion . From then onward Jesus made it clear to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and endure great suffering at the hands of the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be put to death , and be raised on the third day . [ k ]
NCB	Matthew	16	22	[ l ] Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him , saying , “ God forbid , Lord . Such a fate must never happen to you. ”
NCB	Matthew	16	23	) . - Matthew 16:16 The Son of the living God : in addition to the Messiahship of Jesus found in the other Synoptics at this point , Matthew also has an acknowledgment by Peter of Jesus ’ divinity . Many exegetes believe this is an addition based on Peter ’ s later understanding of the mystery of Christ after the risen Lord appeared to him ( see
NCB	Matthew	16	24	The Conditions of Discipleship . Jesus then said to his disciples , “ Anyone who wishes to follow me must deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
NCB	Matthew	16	25	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it . [ m ]
NCB	Matthew	16	26	. - Matthew 16:28 Coming after v.
NCB	Matthew	16	27	, which alludes to the Second Coming of Christ , i.e. , as Judge at the end of the world , this verse may refer to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D.
NCB	Matthew	16	28	Amen , I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. ” [ n ] Footnotes - Matthew 16:1 The preaching , works , and extraordinary miracles of Jesus constituted a convincing proof of his Messiahship . The Pharisees and Sadducees demand a sign from heaven , like the stopping of the sun . Jesus flatly refuses to do so . He offers only the sign of Jonah , which foreshadows the mystery of his Death and Resurrection ( see Mt 12:38-42 ) . - Matthew 16:4 Adulterous : i.e. , unfaithful to the Lord . - Matthew 16:5 The disciples at first misunderstand their Master , for whom the nourishment of humans is not reduced to bread alone . Jesus wishes to preserve his own from legalism . The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees is the rigid teaching of specialists of religion who snuff out freedom , joy , spontaneity , and commitment . - Matthew 16:13 Following the section of the bread ( Mt 14:13—16:12 ) , the evangelist appends a series of episodes that have to do with the revelation of the mystery of Christ . In addition to the text taken from Mark , which sets forth the theology of the Messianic secret and the suffering Servant , he presents the passages that speak of the primacy of Peter ( Mt 16:17-19 ) and the payment of the temple tax ( Mt 17:24-27 ) , thus highlighting the theme of the foundation of the Church . The new People of God will then rise not from a Messianic triumphalism but from the mysterious drama of the Messiah ’ s Passion and Resurrection . - Matthew 16:13 Caesarea Philippi had been built by Herod Philip near the springs of the Jordan , at the foot of Mount Hermon . The name “ Caesarea ” was given as an act of homage to the Roman Emperor ; since so many cities had the name , some further qualifier had to be added ( “ Philip ’ s Caesarea ” ) . “ Caesarea in Palestine , ” to take one example , was the ordinary residence of the governor ( see Acts
NCB	Matthew	16	70	, which came to be regarded as a punishment from God for the refusal of the Jews to accept Jesus as the Messiah . The verse may also refer to Christ ’ s Resurrection and his appearances thereafter as well as to the Transfiguration , which is a manifestation of his glory .
NCB	Matthew	17	17	Jesus said in reply , “ O unbelieving and perverse generation , how much longer shall I remain with you ? How much longer must I put up with you ? Bring the boy here to me. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	1	Six days later , Jesus took Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain [ b ] by themselves .
NCB	Matthew	17	2	Chr 24:9 ; Neh 10:32 ) . It was approximately two days ’ wages and was used for the upkeep of the temple . The two drachmas had to be paid in Jewish money ; this explains the presence of money changers in the entrance halls of the temple ( Mt 21:12 ; Jn 2:15 ) . Silver coin : literally , a “ stater , ” which was worth four drachmas , or twice the amount of the tax . Jesus submits to the law out of respect for others , but he affirms that as Son of Man he is not bound by it . Christians who obey the law remain free with respect to all authority and are subject to God alone .
NCB	Matthew	17	3	Suddenly , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah , conversing with him .
NCB	Matthew	17	4	Then Peter said to Jesus , “ Lord , it is good for us to be here . If you wish , I will make three tents here—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	5	While he was still speaking , suddenly a bright cloud cast a shadow over them . Then a voice from the cloud said , “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . Listen to him. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	6	When the disciples heard this , they fell on their faces and were greatly frightened .
NCB	Matthew	17	7	But Jesus came and touched them , saying , “ Stand up , and do not be frightened. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	8	And when they raised their eyes , they saw no one , but only Jesus . Elijah Has Already Come . [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	17	9	As they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , “ Tell no one about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	10	And the disciples asked him , “ Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NCB	Matthew	17	11	He said in reply , “ Elijah will indeed come , and he will set everything right again .
NCB	Matthew	17	12	However , I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him , but they did to him whatever they pleased . In the same way , the Son of Man will suffer at their hands. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist .
NCB	Matthew	17	14	Jesus Heals a Boy with a Demon . [ d ] When they returned to the crowd , a man came up to Jesus , fell to his knees before him ,
NCB	Matthew	17	15	and pleaded , “ Lord , have pity on my son , for he is subject to epileptic seizures and endures great suffering . He falls often into fire and often into water .
NCB	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your disciples , but they could not cure him. ”
NCB	Matthew	17	18	Then Jesus rebuked the demon , and it came out of the boy , and he was cured from that very moment .
NCB	Matthew	17	19	Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked him privately , “ Why were we not able to cast it out ? ”
NCB	Matthew	17	20	He answered , “ Because you have such little faith . Amen , I say to you , if you have faith as tiny as a mustard seed , you will be able to say to this mountain : ‘ Move from here to there , ’ and it will move . Nothing will be impossible for you . [
NCB	Matthew	17	21	But this kind of demon does not come out except by prayer and fasting . ] ” [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	17	22	Jesus Predicts His Passion a Second Time . [ f ] When they were together in Galilee , Jesus said to them , “ The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the power of men .
NCB	Matthew	17	23	They will kill him , and on the third day he will be raised. ” And they were overwhelmed with grief .
NCB	Matthew	17	24	Jesus Pays the Temple Tax . [ g ] When they arrived at Capernaum , the collectors of the temple tax came up to Peter and asked , “ Doesn ’ t your teacher pay the temple tax ? ”
NCB	Matthew	17	25	“ Yes , he does , ” he replied . When Peter went into the house , but before he had a chance to speak , Jesus asked him , “ Simon , what is your opinion ? From whom do the kings of the earth exact tolls and taxes—from their own sons or from others ? ”
NCB	Matthew	17	26	And when he said , “ From others , ” Jesus replied , “ Then their sons are exempt .
NCB	Matthew	17	27	However , lest we give offense to them , go to the lake and cast a hook . Take the first fish that you catch and open its mouth . There you will find a silver coin . Take it and give it to them for me and for yourself. ” Footnotes - Matthew 17:1 At the Transfiguration , the same voice that at the moment of his Baptism had indicated to Jesus the way of a suffering Messianism now manifests him as the true Messiah to the three apostles who would witness his agony in the garden . For a few seconds Jesus ’ humanity is resplendent with the divine glory of which he had divested himself during his earthly life . - Matthew 17:1 A high mountain : since the 4th century , this has been identified with Tabor (
NCB	Matthew	17	1843	feet high ) on the Plain of Esdraelon . - Matthew 17:9 According to an ancient story , Elijah was assumed into heaven , while a prophecy claimed that he would return to prepare the people for the Messianic Age ( see Mal 3:23-24 ; Sir 48:1-11 ) . - Matthew 17:14 This miracle has the purpose of highlighting the power of Jesus against the power of Satan , thus erasing all doubts that Jesus is the Messiah . Jesus states with some disappointment that not even his disciples have attained true faith . - Matthew 17:21 This verse is missing in the most important manuscripts and seems to be taken from Mk 9:29 . - Matthew 17:22 This is the second of Christ ’ s three predictions of his Passion ( see Mt 16:21-23 ) and the least detailed . The disciples are overwhelmed with grief . - Matthew 17:24 On reaching the age of twenty , every Jew had to pay two drachmas each year ( Ex 30:13 ;
NCB	Matthew	18	18	is known as the “ ecclesiastical discourse ” because it describes the demands made by brotherhood in the Church of Jesus , which is a community of love , prayer , and forgiveness . - Matthew 18:1 The true disciple of Jesus must renounce all ambition and become as simple and humble as a child . - Matthew 18:5 Woe to those who give scandal to the little ones , i.e. , the disciples of the Gospel , so as to make them fall . The Lord identifies himself with them and issues severe threats for those who wish to pervert them . Indeed , they have angels who always see the face of the Father in heaven—the guardian angels—thus showing their great worth in God ’ s eyes . - Matthew 18:8 These verses are already to be found substantially in Mt 5:29-30 ; the evangelist repeats them because they have to do with “ scandal. ” The point is that no one can be saved who does not break completely with evil . - Matthew 18:11 This verse is missing from the most important manuscripts and seems to have been transferred to this point from Lk 19:10 . - Matthew 18:12 In this parable , Jesus suggests what price the Father attaches to the salvation of sinners . The evangelist uses it as an appeal to the community that it may never become inhospitable to the least of believers , no matter how lost they may appear . - Matthew 18:15 When believers live with trust in God and in communion with one another , Christ is in their midst . Doubtless , judgment is to be passed upon those who “ sin , ” i.e. , who gravely and publicly injure the unity ; but all must remain ready to forgive without measure . - Matthew 18:22 Seventy times seven : the Greek word may also be translated “ seventy-seven times. ” - Matthew 18:23 The law of pardon must ceaselessly renew the fraternal relationships in the Church . It is founded on the goodness of God who gratuitously forgives the immense sin of human beings . - Matthew 18:24 Ten thousand talents : an enormous sum , equivalent to about 250,000 kg of silver . The Attic talent in circulation at that time was worth
NCB	Matthew	18	1	At that time , the disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? ”
NCB	Matthew	18	2	Then Jesus beckoned a child to come to him , placed it in their midst ,
NCB	Matthew	18	3	and said , “ Amen , I say to you , unless you change and become like little children , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven .
NCB	Matthew	18	4	gr and was the salary for a day ’ s work . A hundred denarii were therefore a sum 600,000 times less than the ten thousand talents .
NCB	Matthew	18	5	“ And whoever receives one such child in my name receives me .
NCB	Matthew	18	6	But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea .
NCB	Matthew	18	7	Woe to the world because of scandals . Such things are bound to occur , but woe to the one through whom they come .
NCB	Matthew	18	8	[ d ] “ If your hand or your foot is an occasion of sin for you , cut it off and throw it away . It is preferable for you to enter into life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire .
NCB	Matthew	18	9	And if your eye causes you to sin , tear it out and throw it away . It is preferable for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the fires of Gehenna .
NCB	Matthew	18	10	“ Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones , for I tell you that their angels in heaven gaze continually on the face of my heavenly Father . [
NCB	Matthew	18	11	For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost . ] [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	18	12	The Parable of the Lost Sheep . [ f ] “ Tell me your opinion . If a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away , will he not leave the other ninety-nine on the hillside and go off in search of the one who went astray ?
NCB	Matthew	18	13	And if he finds it , amen , I say to you , he is more filled with joy over it than over the ninety-nine who did not wander off .
NCB	Matthew	18	14	In the same way , it is not the will of your Father in heaven that a single one of these little ones should be lost .
NCB	Matthew	18	15	The Church : Community of Love , Prayer , and Pardon . [ g ] “ If your brother wrongs you , go and take up the matter with him when the two of you are alone . If he listens to you , you have won your brother over .
NCB	Matthew	18	16	But if he will not listen , take one or two others along with you , so that every detail may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses .
NCB	Matthew	18	17	If he refuses to listen to them , report it to the Church . And if he refuses to listen to the Church , treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector .
NCB	Matthew	18	19	[ Amen , ] I say to you , further , if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for , it will be granted to you by my Father in heaven .
NCB	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name , I am there in their midst. ”
NCB	Matthew	18	21	Then Peter came up to him and asked , “ Lord , if my brother sins against me , how often must I forgive him ? As many as seven times ? ”
NCB	Matthew	18	22	Jesus answered , “ I say to you , not seven times but seventy times seven . [ h ]
NCB	Matthew	18	23	The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant . [ i ] “ For this reason , the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants .
NCB	Matthew	18	24	When he began the accounting , a man was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents . [ j ]
NCB	Matthew	18	25	Since he had no possible way to repay what he owed , his master ordered him to be sold , together with his wife , his children , and all his property , to satisfy the debt .
NCB	Matthew	18	26	At this , the servant fell to his knees , saying , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will repay you in full. ’
NCB	Matthew	18	27	Moved with compassion , the master of that servant let him go and canceled the debt .
NCB	Matthew	18	28	“ However , when that servant left , he encountered one of his fellow servants who owed him one hundred denarii , [ k ] and , choking him , he demanded , ‘ Pay me back what you owe. ’
NCB	Matthew	18	29	His fellow servant fell to his knees and pleaded with him , saying , ‘ Be patient with me and I will repay you. ’
NCB	Matthew	18	30	But he turned a deaf ear and had him thrown into prison until he had repaid the debt .
NCB	Matthew	18	31	“ When his fellow servants observed what had happened , they were greatly upset , and , going to their master , they reported everything that had taken place .
NCB	Matthew	18	32	Then his master sent for the man and said to him , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you for your complete debt because you begged me .
NCB	Matthew	18	33	Should you not have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you ? ’
NCB	Matthew	18	34	And in his anger his master handed him over to be tortured until he repaid the entire debt .
NCB	Matthew	18	35	In the same way , my heavenly Father will also deal with you unless each of you forgives his brother from the heart. ” Footnotes - Matthew 18:1 In this fourth collection of the sayings of Jesus , there are a good number that we have already met , and we recognize here , at times , the tone of the “ Sermon on the Mount ” ( chs . 5–7 ) . Everything is focused on the coming of the kingdom , but the words of Jesus now apply to the community life of the disciples . Chapter

NCB	Matthew	19	1	Cor 7:7 ) . - Matthew 19:13 The Gospel has retained this spontaneous and true gesture because it is also a sign . To enter into the kingdom , i.e. , into intimacy with God , one must be free of all pretense and become poor and little for humans are always weak and needy before God . - Matthew 19:16 To follow Jesus means to be as poor and free as he is . But how can people detach themselves from what they are ? Nothing would seem more impossible . Yet to be a Christian is to believe in the impossible things that God can accomplish in human beings . - Matthew 19:27 Communion of life with Jesus is worth far more than all the things of the earth abandoned by the disciples , for they will reign with him in his eschatological kingdom .
NCB	Matthew	19	2	Large crowds followed him , and he healed them there .
NCB	Matthew	19	3	Some Pharisees came forward and tested him by asking , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason whatsoever ? ”
NCB	Matthew	19	4	He replied , “ Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘ made them male and female ’
NCB	Matthew	19	5	and said : ‘ That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife , and the two become one flesh ’ ?
NCB	Matthew	19	6	And so they are no longer two but one flesh . Therefore , what God has joined together , let no one separate. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	7	They said to him , “ Why then did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away ? ”
NCB	Matthew	19	8	He replied , “ It was because you were so hard-hearted that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives , but it was not like this from the beginning .
NCB	Matthew	19	9	: “ except if the marriage was unlawful , ” has been the subject of much debate ( on this point see what was said at Mt 5:32 ) . In the Judaism of that age , not to marry seemed something repugnant and almost a crime ; not to have a posterity seemed a punishment ; however , some religious sects did practice voluntary continence . John and Jesus had renounced marriage in order to live solely for their mission of proclaiming the kingdom of God . - Matthew 19:12 The virginity recommended by Jesus manifests the new creation of the New Covenant and is the prelude to the kingdom ( see Mt 22:30 ) . However , the renunciation of marriage out of love for the kingdom is possible only through the medium of a charism , a special gift of God ( see
NCB	Matthew	19	10	His disciples said to him , “ If that is the situation between a husband and wife , it is better not to marry. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	11	He replied , “ Not everyone can accept this teaching , but only those to whom it has been given .
NCB	Matthew	19	12	For there are eunuchs who have been made so from birth and eunuchs who were made so by others , and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven . Let those accept this who can do so. ” [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	19	13	Jesus Receives Little Children . [ d ] Then people brought children to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray . The disciples rebuked them ,
NCB	Matthew	19	14	but Jesus said , “ Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them . For it is to such as these that the kingdom of heaven belongs. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	15	And after he had laid his hands on them he proceeded on his way .
NCB	Matthew	19	16	The Rich Young Man . [ e ] Then a man came forward and asked him , “ Teacher , what good thing must I do to achieve eternal life ? ”
NCB	Matthew	19	17	He said to him , “ Why do you ask me about what is good ? There is only one who is good . But if you wish to enter into life , keep the commandments. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	18	He said , “ Which ones ? ” And Jesus answered , “ You shall not kill . You shall not commit adultery . You shall not steal . You shall not bear false witness .
NCB	Matthew	19	20	The young man said to him , “ I have observed all these . Is there anything more I must do ? ”
NCB	Matthew	19	21	Jesus replied , “ If you wish to be perfect , go , sell your possessions , and give the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	22	When the young man heard this , he went away grieving , for he possessed great wealth .
NCB	Matthew	19	23	Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ Amen , I say to you , it will be difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven .
NCB	Matthew	19	24	Again I tell you , it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	25	When the disciples heard this , they were astonished , and they asked , “ Who then can be saved ? ”
NCB	Matthew	19	26	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For men this is impossible , but for God all things are possible. ”
NCB	Matthew	19	27	Reward for Following Jesus . [ f ] Then Peter said in reply , “ We have given up everything to follow you . What then will there be for us ? ”
NCB	Matthew	19	28	Jesus replied , “ Amen , I say to you , at the renewal of all things , when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will yourselves sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NCB	Matthew	19	29	And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more and will inherit eternal life .
NCB	Matthew	19	30	But many who are first will be last , and the last will be first . Footnotes - Matthew 19:1 A new series of incidents , followed by a great discourse on the end of the world , make up the fifth part of the Gospel of Matthew . Jesus now goes to Judea , location of the official religion . - Matthew 19:1 The interpreters of the Law thought up many subtle ways of making divorce easy ; they lacked understanding of the essential point . Jesus ’ purpose is to recover the purity of the original state and the will of the Creator himself for the human race . He could not allow the unity of the couple to be at the mercy of circumstances , since this unity had been asserted by God as a call inherent in the very condition of man and woman ( see Gen 2:24 ) . Did the rule admit exceptions ? The phrase in v.
NCB	Matthew	20	20	The Son of Man Has Come To Serve . [ g ] Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons and made a request of him after kneeling before him .
NCB	Matthew	20	1	“ The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard .
NCB	Matthew	20	2	After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius [ b ] a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
NCB	Matthew	20	3	Going out about nine o ’ clock , [ c ] he saw some others standing idle in the marketplace .
NCB	Matthew	20	4	He said to them , ‘ You also go into my vineyard and I will give you what is just. ’
NCB	Matthew	20	5	When he went out again around noon and at three in the afternoon , [ d ] he did the same .
NCB	Matthew	20	6	Then , about five o ’ clock , [ e ] he went out and found others standing around , and he said to them , ‘ Why have you been standing here idle all day ? ’
NCB	Matthew	20	7	They answered , ‘ Because no one has hired us. ’ He said to them , ‘ You too go into my vineyard. ’
NCB	Matthew	20	8	“ When evening came , the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman , ‘ Summon the workers and give them their pay , beginning with those who came last and ending with the first. ’
NCB	Matthew	20	9	When those who had started to labor at five o ’ clock came , each of them received a denarius .
NCB	Matthew	20	10	Therefore , those who had come first thought that they would receive more , but they were paid a denarius , the same as the others .
NCB	Matthew	20	11	And when they received it , they began to grumble against the landowner ,
NCB	Matthew	20	12	saying , ‘ These men who were hired last worked only one hour , and yet you have rewarded them on the same level with us who have borne the greatest portion of the work and the heat of the day. ’
NCB	Matthew	20	13	“ The owner replied to one of them , ‘ Friend , I am not treating you unfairly . Did you not agree with me to work for a denarius ?
NCB	Matthew	20	14	Take your pay and leave . I have chosen to pay the latecomers the same as I pay you .
NCB	Matthew	20	15	Am I not free to do as I wish with my own money ? Or are you envious because I am generous ? ’
NCB	Matthew	20	16	Thus , the last will be first and the first will be last. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	17	Jesus Predicts His Passion a Third Time . [ f ] As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and said to them ,
NCB	Matthew	20	18	“ Behold , we are now going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death .
NCB	Matthew	20	19	Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified , and on the third day he will be raised to life. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	21	“ What do you wish ? ” he asked her . She said to him , “ Promise that these two sons of mine may sit , one at your right hand and the other at your left , in your kingdom. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	22	Jesus said in reply , “ You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup [ h ] I am going to drink ? ” They said to him , “ We can. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	23	He then said to them , “ You shall indeed drink my cup , but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not in my power to grant . Those places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	24	When the other ten disciples heard this , they were indignant at the two brothers .
NCB	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them over and said , “ You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones make their authority over them felt .
NCB	Matthew	20	26	This must not be so with you . Instead , whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant ,
NCB	Matthew	20	27	and whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant .
NCB	Matthew	20	28	In the same way , the Son of Man did not come to be served but rather to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. ” [ i ]
NCB	Matthew	20	29	Two Blind Men Receive Sight . [ j ] As they were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed Jesus .
NCB	Matthew	20	30	Two blind men were sitting by the roadside , and when they learned that Jesus was passing by , they shouted , “ Lord , Son of David , take pity on us. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	31	The crowd rebuked them and told them to be silent , but they only shouted even more loudly , “ Lord , Son of David , take pity on us. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	32	Jesus stopped and called them , saying , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
NCB	Matthew	20	33	They said to him , “ Lord , grant that our eyes may be opened. ”
NCB	Matthew	20	34	Jesus , moved with compassion , touched their eyes . Immediately , they received their sight and followed him . Footnotes - Matthew 20:1 The parable of the workers in the vineyard teaches that the promised kingdom is a gift of grace and not a wage . For salvation is not the fruit of a commercial contract but consists in a communion of love , a filial response on the part of humans to the initiative of God , who offers them his friendship . Christians who do good can not boast of rights before God . They should merely do all they can to correspond with God ’ s call and render themselves ever less unworthy of his friendship . - Matthew 20:2 Denarius : a Roman coin that was the normal daily wage at the time—what a Roman soldier also received . - Matthew 20:3 Nine o ’ clock : literally , “ the third hour. ” - Matthew 20:5 Noon . . . three in the afternoon : literally , “ the sixth hour . . . the ninth hour. ” - Matthew 20:6 Five o ’ clock : literally , “ the eleventh hour. ” - Matthew 20:17 At the moment when he starts out for Jerusalem , Jesus clearly confronts the drama of his sacrifice . This third prediction of the Passion is much more detailed than the first two . - Matthew 20:20 The apostles were still dreaming of an earthly Messianic kingdom and seeking an important role in it . However , their recompense would be a gift from the heavenly Father , not a right of their own . Jesus ’ mission in the world was to save human beings and not to assign them their prize . - Matthew 20:22 Drink the cup : in the idiom of the Bible , this meant to meet suffering ( see Isa 51:17 ; Jer 25:15 ; Ps 75:9 ) . - Matthew 20:28 As the suffering Servant ( Isa
NCB	Matthew	20	53	) , Jesus has come to expiate the sins of all , offering the Father his own life as the price of the ransom , i.e. , as the supreme expression of love . - Matthew 20:29 Until the very end Jesus is the one who hears the cry of the distressed , the one who gives human beings light and calls them to follow him .
NCB	Matthew	21	21	Jesus answered them , “ Amen , I say to you , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only will you do what has been done to this fig tree , but even if you say to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ’ it will be accomplished .
NCB	Matthew	21	1	When they drew near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives , Jesus sent off two disciples ,
NCB	Matthew	21	2	Chr 24:21 ; Heb 11:37 ; Lk 13:34 ) ? Is not the son here Jesus himself ? Scholars believe that some allegorical elements have been added herein to a basic parable originally spoken by Christ . One reason for their belief is the newly found apocryphal Gospel of Thomas , which contains ( #
NCB	Matthew	21	3	If anyone says anything to you , tell them , ‘ The Lord needs them. ’ Then he will let you have them at once. ”
NCB	Matthew	21	4	This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the prophet :
NCB	Matthew	21	5	; Jesus is speaking of God and his people . How can we forget the tragic history of the Prophets , who were rejected , tormented , and stoned to death (
NCB	Matthew	21	6	The disciples went off and did as Jesus had instructed them .
NCB	Matthew	21	7	) . But the sumptuous display in the courts of princes was of quite a different nature . Once again , Jesus rejects all dreams of prestige ; here he is , in the midst of the people , riding the beast of the poor , the donkey , and linking himself in this manner with the Davidic tradition . - Matthew 21:5 Daughter of Zion : i.e. , Jerusalem , which rises on Mount Zion ; the citation is from Isa 62:11 . There follows the prophecy of Zec 9:9 , which describes the Messiah , a humble and meek king taking peaceful possession of his kingdom . - Matthew 21:7 He sat on them [ the cloaks ] : from Mark ( 11:2 ) and Luke ( 19:30 ) , we know that Jesus rode on the colt . It was customary for a mother donkey to follow her offspring closely . Hence Matthew mentions two animals . - Matthew 21:9 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord : taken from Ps 118:26f , this phrase does not express the customary greeting directed at the pilgrim who had reached the Holy City . Like the Hosanna mentioned above , it is an acclamation to the Messiah who is taking possession of his kingdom . - Matthew 21:12 As if to stress the authority of the Messiah , the evangelist follows up the entry into Jerusalem with Jesus ’ cleansing of the temple . He then adds the acclamation of the children , in whom he sees the fulfillment of another prophecy . John , on the other hand , places the cleansing of the temple at the beginning of Christ ’ s public ministry . While not ruling out two distinct cleansings , scholars usually prefer the chronology of John , since the Synoptics have chosen to assign the whole of Christ ’ s activity in Judea to the last period of his life . - Matthew 21:13 Jesus combines two Old Testament prophecies : Isa 56:7 ( “ My house shall be called a house of prayer ” ) and Jer 7:11 ( “ Has this house , which bears my name become in your eyes a den of thieves ? ” ) . - Matthew 21:18 The cursing of the fig tree is a symbolic act , a kind of parable in action . It signifies the condemnation of Israel , which has now become a sterile plant . The ancient Prophets often had recourse to this type of teaching . - Matthew 21:23 This is the first of five controversies between Jesus and the religious authorities of Judaism in Mt 21:23—22:46 . They are in a question-and-answer form and are interrupted after the first by three parables on the judgment of Israel ( Mt 21:28-32 ; 21:33-46 ; 22:1-14 ) . - Matthew 21:27 The religious authorities claim ignorance of the origin of John ’ s baptism and thereby demonstrate that they can not speak with authority . Therefore , Jesus refuses to tell them by what authority he acts . - Matthew 21:28 The parable of the two sons denounces a religion that is content with words and appearances . The facile “ Yes ” on the lips is a poor disguise for the refusal of the heart . To the hypocrisy of the recognized teachers , Jesus opposes the true faith of the poor . The evangelist utilizes this parable to indicate the end of Israel ’ s privileges and the entrance of Gentiles into the growing Church . - Matthew 21:33 The parable repeats , almost word for word , passages from the beautiful , sad song of the vineyard in Isa
NCB	Matthew	21	8	A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road , while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road .
NCB	Matthew	21	9	The crowds that preceded him and those that followed kept shouting : “ Hosanna to the Son of David ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! [ d ] Hosanna in the highest ! ”
NCB	Matthew	21	10	And when he entered Jerusalem , the whole city was filled with excitement . “ Who is this ? ” the people asked ,
NCB	Matthew	21	11	and the crowds replied , “ This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee. ”
NCB	Matthew	21	12	Jesus Cleanses the Temple . [ e ] Then Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those whom he found buying and selling there . He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves .
NCB	Matthew	21	13	He said to them , “ It is written : ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer , ’ but you are making it a den of thieves. ” [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	21	14	The blind and the crippled came to him in the temple , and he cured them .
NCB	Matthew	21	15	But when the chief priests and the scribes witnessed the wonderful things he was performing and heard the children crying out in the temple area , “ Hosanna to the Son of David , ” they became infuriated
NCB	Matthew	21	16	and said to him , “ Do you hear what they are saying ? ” Jesus replied , “ Yes . Have you never read the text : ‘ Out of the mouths of infants and babies who are nursing you have received fitting praise ’ ? ”
NCB	Matthew	21	17	Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany , where he spent the night .
NCB	Matthew	21	18	The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree . [ g ] Early the next morning , as he was returning to the city , he was hungry .
NCB	Matthew	21	19	Noticing a fig tree by the side of the road , he went over to it but found nothing on its branches except leaves . Then he said to it , “ May you never give forth fruit again ! ” And instantly the fig tree withered away .
NCB	Matthew	21	20	When the disciples witnessed this , they were stunned , and they asked , “ How could that fig tree wither away in an instant ? ”
NCB	Matthew	21	22	Whatever you ask for in faith-filled prayer , you will receive. ”
NCB	Matthew	21	23	The Authority of Jesus Questioned . [ h ] When he entered the temple and began to teach , the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him and asked , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? And who gave you this authority ? ”
NCB	Matthew	21	24	Jesus said to them in reply , “ I will also ask you one question . If you give me an answer , then I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
NCB	Matthew	21	25	Where did John ’ s baptism originate ? From heaven or from men ? ” They argued among themselves , “ If we say : ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NCB	Matthew	21	26	But if we say , ‘ From men , ’ we are afraid of the people , for they all regard John as a prophet. ”
NCB	Matthew	21	27	Therefore , they answered Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And Jesus said to them , “ Then neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things . [ i ]
NCB	Matthew	21	28	The Parable of the Two Sons . [ j ] “ What is your opinion about this ? A man had two sons . He went to the first and said , ‘ My son , go and work in the vineyard today. ’
NCB	Matthew	21	29	He answered , ‘ I will not , ’ but later he had a change of heart and went .
NCB	Matthew	21	30	The father then gave the same instruction to the second son , who answered , ‘ Of course I will , ’ but then did not go .
NCB	Matthew	21	31	Which of the two complied with his father ’ s instruction ? ” They responded , “ The first. ” Then Jesus said to them , “ Amen , I say to you , tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you .
NCB	Matthew	21	32	For John came to show you the path of righteousness , but you did not believe him , whereas the tax collectors and the prostitutes did . Yet even after you realized that , you still refused to change your minds and believe in him .
NCB	Matthew	21	33	The Parable of the Tenants . [ k ] “ Listen to another parable . There was a landowner who planted a vineyard , fenced it in on all sides , dug a winepress in it , and built a watchtower . Then he leased it to tenants and went off on a journey .
NCB	Matthew	21	34	“ When the time for harvest approached , he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the produce .
NCB	Matthew	21	35	But the tenants seized his servants and beat one of them , killed another , and stoned a third .
NCB	Matthew	21	36	Again , he sent more servants , but they treated them in the same manner .
NCB	Matthew	21	37	“ Finally , he sent his son to them , thinking , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NCB	Matthew	21	38	But when the tenants saw the son , they said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and get his inheritance. ’
NCB	Matthew	21	39	And so they seized him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
NCB	Matthew	21	40	“ Now what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do to those tenants when he comes ? ”
NCB	Matthew	21	41	They said to him , “ He will kill those evil men , and then he will lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the harvest. ”
NCB	Matthew	21	42	Jesus then said to them , “ Have you never read in the Scriptures : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ; by the Lord has this been done , and it is wonderful in our eyes ’ ?
NCB	Matthew	21	43	Therefore , I tell you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce fruit in abundance . [
NCB	Matthew	21	44	The one who falls on this stone will be broken into pieces , and the one on whom it falls will be crushed . ] ” [ l ]
NCB	Matthew	21	45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they realized that he was speaking about them .
NCB	Matthew	21	46	They wanted to arrest him , but they were afraid of the crowds , who regarded him as a prophet . Footnotes - Matthew 21:1 One of the key events in the life of Jesus . He seemed to be fulfilling what was most attractive in the Old Testament prophecies : here is the Messiah in the midst of his people , God ’ s messenger in the midst of the human race , and joyous shouts of acclamation arise on every side . Hosanna means “ Grant salvation ! ” but it is above all a shout of applause . Jesus allows himself to be acclaimed as the “ Son of David , ” the Savior from the royal line , the figure that the believing people had , generation after generation , tried to picture for themselves in light of the promise made to David (
NCB	Matthew	21	65	) a more primitive form of the parable . - Matthew 21:44 Some manuscripts do not have this verse , which indicates that both hostility and apathy are wrong responses to Christ . It may be an early addition to this Gospel based on Lk 20:18 .
NCB	Matthew	22	22	Stunned on hearing this reply , they went away and left him alone .
NCB	Matthew	22	1	Jesus spoke to them again in parables , saying ,
NCB	Matthew	22	2	“ The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son .
NCB	Matthew	22	3	He sent forth his servants to summon those who had been invited to the banquet , but they refused to come .
NCB	Matthew	22	4	Then he sent other servants , saying , ‘ Tell those who have been invited , “ Behold , my banquet has been prepared , my oxen and my fattened cattle have been slaughtered , and everything is ready . Come to the wedding banquet. ” ’
NCB	Matthew	22	5	“ But they ignored his invitation . One went off to his farm , another to his business ,
NCB	Matthew	22	6	while the rest seized his servants , mistreated them , and killed them .
NCB	Matthew	22	7	“ The king was enraged , and he sent forth his troops who destroyed those murderers and burned their city to the ground .
NCB	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The wedding banquet is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy of that honor .
NCB	Matthew	22	9	Go forth , therefore , to the main roads and invite everyone you can find to the wedding banquet. ’
NCB	Matthew	22	10	The servants went forth into the streets and gathered together everyone they could find , good and bad alike . And so the wedding hall was filled with guests .
NCB	Matthew	22	11	[ b ] “ But when the king came in to greet the guests , he noticed one man who was not properly dressed for a wedding .
NCB	Matthew	22	12	‘ My friend , ’ he said to him , ‘ how did you gain entrance here without a wedding garment ? ’ The man was speechless .
NCB	Matthew	22	13	Then the king said to the attendants , ‘ Bind his hands and feet and cast him outside into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
NCB	Matthew	22	14	For many are called , but few are chosen. ” [ c ]
NCB	Matthew	22	15	God or Caesar . [ d ] Then the Pharisees went off and made plans to trap him in what he said .
NCB	Matthew	22	16	They sent some of their disciples to him , along with the Herodians , [ e ] and said , “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . Nor are you concerned with anyone ’ s opinion for you do not care about people ’ s opinions .
NCB	Matthew	22	17	Tell us then what you think about this : Is it lawful or not for us to pay taxes to Caesar ? ”
NCB	Matthew	22	18	Jesus was aware of their malicious intent , and he said , “ You hypocrites ! Why are you trying to trap me ?
NCB	Matthew	22	19	Show me the coin that is used for paying the tax. ” When they brought him a denarius , [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	22	20	he asked them , “ Whose image is this , and whose inscription ? ”
NCB	Matthew	22	21	They replied , “ Caesar ’ s. ” On hearing this , he said to them , “ Give to Caesar what is due to Caesar , and to God what is due to God. ” [ g ]
NCB	Matthew	22	23	Marriage and the Resurrection . [ h ] On that same day , the Sadducees , who assert that there is no resurrection , approached him and posed this question ,
NCB	Matthew	22	24	“ Teacher , Moses said that if a man dies without having children , his brother [ i ] is to marry his brother ’ s wife and raise up children for his brother .
NCB	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers who belonged to our group . The first one married and died without issue , and therefore left his wife to his brother .
NCB	Matthew	22	26	The same result occurred with the second brother and the third , right down to the seventh .
NCB	Matthew	22	27	Finally , the woman herself died .
NCB	Matthew	22	28	Now at the resurrection , whose wife of the seven will she be , inasmuch as all of them had her ? ”
NCB	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered them , “ You are in error , for you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God .
NCB	Matthew	22	30	At the resurrection they will neither marry nor be given in marriage . They are like the angels in heaven .
NCB	Matthew	22	31	“ And in regard to the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what God himself said to you :
NCB	Matthew	22	32	‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living. ”
NCB	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this , they were astonished at his teaching .
NCB	Matthew	22	34	The Greatest Commandment . [ j ] When the Pharisees learned that he had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered together ,
NCB	Matthew	22	35	and , to test him , one of them , a lawyer , asked this question ,
NCB	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , which is the greatest commandment in the Law ? ”
NCB	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said to him , “ ‘ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind. ’
NCB	Matthew	22	38	This is the greatest and the first commandment .
NCB	Matthew	22	39	The second is like it : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’
NCB	Matthew	22	40	Everything in the Law and the Prophets depends on these two commandments. ”
NCB	Matthew	22	41	Jesus Is Lord . [ k ] While the Pharisees were assembled together , Jesus asked them this question ,
NCB	Matthew	22	42	“ What is your opinion about the Christ ? Whose son is he ? ” They replied , “ He is the son of David. ”
NCB	Matthew	22	43	) . - Matthew 22:23 Faith in a resurrection became common only toward the end of the Old Testament period . Not all shared the certainty ; the Sadducees , the aristocrats of the priestly class and men concerned more with politics than with religion , considered it a rather debatable theological novelty . They debate it with Jesus , using arguments that emerge as caricature and prevent access to the heart of the question . Jesus answers in the name of the Jewish faith in God : God stands on the side of life . - Matthew 22:24 If a man dies . . . his brother : this custom is known as the “ law of the levirate , ” from the Latin word for brother-in-law ( levir ) . It was intended to continue the family line of the deceased brother ( see Deut 25:6 ) . - Matthew 22:34 Instead of dividing the Law into a string of precepts ( the Rabbis counted
NCB	Matthew	22	44	‘ The Lord said to my Lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet ” ’ ?
NCB	Matthew	22	45	If David calls him ‘ Lord , ’ how can he be his son ? ”
NCB	Matthew	22	46	No one was able to give him an answer , and from that day onward no one dared to ask him any further questions . Footnotes - Matthew 22:1 The meaning of this parable is similar to that of the preceding one . The Messianic Kingdom is likened to a nuptial banquet . The king is God ; the servants are the Prophets ; the invited guests are the Israelites ; the punishment of the city refers to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D.
NCB	Matthew	22	70	; the new invitees are the Gentiles . Some retouches have made the parable a warning to the Church of Matthew as well as a statement of God ’ s judgment on Israel . - Matthew 22:11 Scholars speak of these verses almost as another parable , that of the wedding garment . In this world the good and the wicked are mixed together , for it is the time of patience and mercy . During this time Christians must cooperate with God ’ s grace , which is tantamount to wearing the wedding garment . - Matthew 22:14 Many . . . chosen : this does not seem to allude to the number of the elect , since that is a secret that the Father had reserved to himself . It means that all the Israelites have been invited , but only a few of them have accepted the Gospel . - Matthew 22:15 Here the series of controversies between Jesus and the religious authorities is resumed , beginning with the question of paying taxes to the Roman emperor . For over twenty years , the Roman emperor had been levying a tax on Palestine ; the Jewish people regarded it as a sign of unjust oppression . To pay it was regarded as a denial of Jewish hopes ; to challenge it meant taking the side of revolutionary agitators . Only the elderly and children were exempt ; the Zealots forbade their members to pay it . - Matthew 22:16 Herodians : partisans and courtiers of the reigning dynasty of the Herods . Though they were Jews in religion , their spirit was Gentile . They conspired with their enemies the Pharisees against Christ . - Matthew 22:19 Denarius : the daily wage of a laborer . - Matthew 22:21 Jesus emphasizes that it is not enough to give to Caesar what is due to Caesar ; people must also give to God what is due to God , i.e. , worship and good works ( see Mt 21:41 ,
NCB	Matthew	22	248	) and prohibitions (
NCB	Matthew	22	365	) , Jesus unifies it in two essential commandments : love of God ( Deut 6:5 ) and neighbor ( Lev 19:18 ) . These form the basis of every precept . - Matthew 22:41 For centuries people had been awaiting a Christ , or Messiah , who would be a son of David ; they saw him pictured in an ancient royal psalm that became a song of Messianic expectation ( Ps
NCB	Matthew	22	110	) . But Christ is more than the heir to David ’ s throne ; he possesses the authority of God . Only during his Passion will Jesus expressly claim to be the Messiah ( Mt 26:63-64 ) .
NCB	Matthew	23	23	[ h ] “ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites ! You pay tithes of mint and dill and cumin , but you have neglected the more important aspects of the Law : justice , mercy , and faithfulness . You should have practiced these without neglecting the others .

NCB	Matthew	23	3	Therefore , be careful to do whatever they tell you , but do not follow their example , for they do not practice what they preach .

The tassels had a blue thread running through them as a symbol of heaven ; they were to remind the wearer of the commandments of God ( Num 15:38 ) . - Matthew 23:8 Here Jesus obviously does not abolish the words “ Rabbi , ” “ father , ” and “ teacher. ” He condemns ambition and despotism on the one hand and blind servility on the other . The true Father of Christians is God , and the true Master is Christ , the Son of God . In others , paternal and magistral authority is never absolute , but relative and subordinate to the divine authority . - Matthew 23:13 At that period , Jews tried to win Gentiles over to their religion ; those who came were called proselytes . There were also Gentiles who sympathized with Jewish ways and were called “ God-fearers. ” There must have been rivalries between Jews and Christians in this area . - Matthew 23:14 This verse is identical with Mk 12:40 and seems to have been interpolated from that text . - Matthew 23:15 Convert : a proselyte , that is , a Gentile who had accepted the faith of Israel . Worthy of Gehenna : worthy of damnation . - Matthew 23:16 Jesus shows that the Pharisees were wrong in saying that swearing by the gold of the temple and by the offering that lies on the altar is more binding than swearing by the temple or by the altar . - Matthew 23:23 The Law prescribed a tithe on the most important products . However , the Pharisees had extended it to even the most insignificant herbs , and yet they neglected the duties toward one ’ s neighbor , such as justice , compassion , and fidelity . Thus , they strained their liquids so as not to involuntarily swallow an insect and render themselves unclean yet gave no thought to observing the more grave commandments of the moral law . - Matthew 23:27 You are like whitewashed tombs : an allusion to the custom of whitewashing tombs so that no one might inadvertently touch them and contract a legal uncleanness ( see Num 19:16 ) . - Matthew 23:29 The final curse becomes a prophecy of judgment . It sketches the long history of the opposition between the Israel of human beings and the Israel of God , from the first murder of which the Bible speaks to the last ( in the order in which the books of the Bible were placed at that period ) , that is , from Abel ( Gen 4:8 ) to Zechariah (

Footnotes - Matthew 24:1 Five discourses give the Gospel of Matthew its characteristic structure . Here is the last discourse , which brings together prophecies and parables that speak of the last times of humanity and distinguish its phases . At the center of the scenario is the return of Christ . This great passage is known as the “ eschatological discourse , ” because it deals with the end , the last times ( Greek : eschaton ) . - Matthew 24:1 The prophetic sayings about the last “ days ” abound in descriptions of panic , wars , earthquakes , and cosmic upheavals ; these descriptions are called “ apocalypses , ” that is , “ revelations. ” They defy the imagination in order better to bring out the greatness of God ’ s manifestation in the history of humanity ( see Isa 13:10-13 ; Jer 21:9 ; Ezek 5:12 ; Am 8:8-9 ; Joel 2:10 ; 3:3 ; 4:17-21 ) . Jesus makes use of this entire scenario in order to warn believers about the trials and conflicts in which their fidelity will be tested , and in order to encourage the missionaries of the Gospel . - Matthew 24:1 Jesus announces the destruction of the temple , which is the sign of God ’ s presence among his people . Hence , one must envisage a radical change in the religious life . - Matthew 24:3 There are many indications of Christ ’ s coming at the end of the world . However , no one should be mistaken . Neither the explosion of religious movements , nor the confusion of human societies , nor the catastrophes that pervade human history are signs of the end . The believer must stand fast under trials , which may appear to be excessive at times . - Matthew 24:15 The abomination of desolation : was a pagan idol placed in the midst of the Jerusalem temple ( see Dan 9:27 ; 11:31 ; 12:11 ;
NCB	Matthew	24	70	is described here in order to convey a lesson about the future . - Matthew 24:28 A popular proverb cited also in Lk 17:37 . In this context it signifies both the uncertain time of the Lord ’ s coming and his universal presence . - Matthew 24:29 The coming of the Son of Man is described in the words of the Old Testament ( see Isa 13:9-10 ; 34:4 ; Am 5:18 ; Zec 12:10 ) in order to express the glory and power of God and the confusion of humanity . Christ dead and risen : this is the sign that converts human beings . - Matthew 24:32 The perspective of the end of the world must keep the community on its guard . But it also concerns each disciple , for it has an effect on the end of each individual too . Let everyone be vigilant and active so as not to find oneself barred from the kingdom . - Matthew 24:32 This parable is intended to revive the hope of the first Christians , who are under persecution , with the perspective of the proximity of the glorious kingdom , in accord with the schema of the apocalyptic tradition . Indeed , every Christian lives in this expectation , for with Christ the last period of history has begun . - Matthew 24:36 The early Church is exhorted not to fall into indifference because judgment comes less quickly than expected . The life of humans can not be exhausted in the gloomy flow of hours and days ; it has another horizon : the coming of God , which is unforeseeable but completely certain . It hovers like a threat over the uncaring who seclude themselves in their securities . But it is a power and a source of strength for believers . - Matthew 24:43 This very brief parable of the owner of the house and the thief reinforces the theme of vigilance , for one does not know when the Son of Man will come . - Matthew 24:45 Jesus addresses the religious leaders of his time to place them on guard : the time to render accounts has arrived . But the coming of God is still to take place , and the disciples will be tempted to no longer believe in it . The parable of the faithful servant remains a wake-up call for them . The religious leaders and Christians must not neglect to work for the kingdom as if the Master were always present—God is in their midst .
NCB	Matthew	25	25	Therefore , out of fear I went off and hid your talent in the ground . Behold , I give it back to you. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	1	“ Then [ b ] the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
NCB	Matthew	25	2	Five of them were foolish and five were wise .
NCB	Matthew	25	3	When the foolish ones took their lamps , they neglected to take any oil with them ,
NCB	Matthew	25	4	whereas those who were wise took flasks of oil with their lamps .
NCB	Matthew	25	5	Since the bridegroom was delayed in coming , they all became drowsy and fell asleep .
NCB	Matthew	25	6	“ At midnight , a shout was raised : ‘ Behold , the bridegroom ! Come out to meet him ! ’
NCB	Matthew	25	7	Then all the virgins got up and trimmed their lamps .
NCB	Matthew	25	8	The foolish ones said to the wise , ‘ Give us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	9	The wise ones replied , ‘ No , for there may not be enough for both us and you . You had better go to the merchants and buy some. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	10	“ While they went off to purchase it , the bridegroom arrived , and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet . Then the door was locked .
NCB	Matthew	25	11	Afterward , the other virgins returned , and they cried out , ‘ Lord ! Lord ! Open the door for us ! ’
NCB	Matthew	25	12	But he replied , ‘ Amen , I say to you , I do not know you. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	13	Therefore , stay awake , for you know neither the day nor the hour .
NCB	Matthew	25	14	The Parable of the Talents . [ c ] “ Again , the kingdom of heaven will be like a man going on a journey who summoned his servants and entrusted his property to them .
NCB	Matthew	25	15	To one he gave five talents , [ d ] to another two talents , to a third one talent—to each according to his ability . Then he set forth on his journey .
NCB	Matthew	25	16	“ The servant who had received the five talents promptly went to invest them and gained five more .
NCB	Matthew	25	17	In the same manner , the servant who had received the two talents gained two more .
NCB	Matthew	25	18	But the servant who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master ’ s money .
NCB	Matthew	25	19	“ After a long period of time , the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them .
NCB	Matthew	25	20	The one who had received the five talents came forward , bringing an additional five . ‘ Master , ’ he said , ‘ you gave me five talents . Behold , I have gained five more. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	21	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . Since you have been faithful in small matters , I will give you much greater responsibilities . Come and share your master ’ s joy. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	22	“ Next , the one who had received the two talents also came forward and said , ‘ Master , you gave me two talents . Behold , I have gained two more. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	23	His master said to him , ‘ Well done , good and faithful servant . Since you have been faithful in small matters , I will give you much greater responsibilities . Come and share your master ’ s joy. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	24	“ Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said , ‘ Master , I knew that you were a hard man , reaping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not scatter seed .
NCB	Matthew	25	26	“ His master replied , ‘ You wicked and lazy servant . So you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered !
NCB	Matthew	25	27	Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers , and on my return I would have gotten back my money with interest .
NCB	Matthew	25	28	“ ‘ Therefore , take the talent from him and give it to the one with the ten talents .
NCB	Matthew	25	29	For to everyone who has , more will be given , and he will have an abundance . But from the one who has not , even what he does have will be taken away .
NCB	Matthew	25	30	As for this worthless servant , cast him outside into the darkness , where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	31	The Solemn Judgment at the End of Time . [ e ] “ When the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
NCB	Matthew	25	32	All the nations will be gathered before him , and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
NCB	Matthew	25	33	He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left .
NCB	Matthew	25	34	“ Then the King will say to those on his right , ‘ Come , you who are blessed by my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
NCB	Matthew	25	35	For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink ; I was a stranger and you welcomed me ;
NCB	Matthew	25	36	I was naked and you clothed me ; I was ill and you took care of me ; I was in prison and you came to visit me. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	37	“ Then the righteous will say to him , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and give you something to eat , or thirsty and give you something to drink ?
NCB	Matthew	25	38	When did we see you a stranger and welcome you , or naked and clothe you ?
NCB	Matthew	25	39	When did we see you ill or in prison and come to visit you ? ’
NCB	Matthew	25	40	And the King will answer , ‘ Amen , I say to you , whatever you did for one of the least of these brethren of mine , you did for me. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	41	“ Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Depart from me , you accursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
NCB	Matthew	25	42	For I was hungry and you did not give me anything to eat ; I was thirsty and you did not give me anything to drink ;
NCB	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger and you did not welcome me ; I was naked and you did not give me any clothing ; I was ill and in prison and you did not visit me. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	44	“ Then they will ask him , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison and not minister to you ? ’
NCB	Matthew	25	45	He will answer them , ‘ Amen , I say to you , whatever you failed to do for one of the least of these brethren of mine , you failed to do for me. ’
NCB	Matthew	25	46	And they will go away to eternal punishment , but the righteous will enter eternal life. ” Footnotes - Matthew 25:1 The parable of the ten virgins illustrates a fundamental thought : we must wait with watchful perseverance for the coming of Christ glorified , likened to the arrival of a bridegroom . In the dazzling nuptial ceremony of Palestine , the bride awaited the bridegroom while merrymaking with friends . Around midnight the bridegroom would come accompanied by lamps . After an initial explosion of joy , the cortège would return to the house of the bridegroom , where the banquet would be celebrated . - Matthew 25:1 Then : at the time of the Second Coming . - Matthew 25:14 The parable of the talents completes the preceding one . The Christian religion is not a simple passive expectation . It demands a complete commitment . One must make fruitful the gifts given by God while awaiting the Lord ’ s glorious return . - Matthew 25:15 Talents : a talent was equivalent to
NCB	Matthew	25	6000	days of work . - Matthew 25:31 This passage constitutes the conclusion of the eschatological discourse with the description of the Last Judgment . In the second part of the great discourse ( Mt 24:37 ) , the individual judgment was repeatedly indicated . Now there comes before us the supreme Judge , Jesus Christ in glory , who at the end of time will judge all peoples , without distinction between Jew and Gentile , and will separate the good from the wicked in accord with everyone ’ s works .
NCB	Matthew	26	26	The Last Supper . [ j ] While they were eating , Jesus took bread , and after he had pronounced the blessing , he broke it and gave it to his disciples , saying , “ Take this and eat ; this is my body. ”

NCB	Matthew	26	4	and they made plans to arrest Jesus by deceit and have him put to death .
NCB	Matthew	26	5	However , they said , “ It must not occur during the feast , or the people may begin to riot. ” A Woman of Bethany Anoints Jesus . [ d ]
NCB	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper ,
NCB	Matthew	26	7	a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment and poured it over his head as he reclined at table .
NCB	Matthew	26	8	When the disciples saw this , they became indignant , and they remarked , “ Why this waste ?
NCB	Matthew	26	9	This ointment could have been sold for a considerable sum , with the money given to the poor. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	10	Jesus was aware of their attitude , and he said to them , “ Why are you bothering this woman ? She has performed a good deed for me .
NCB	Matthew	26	11	The poor you will always have with you , [ e ] but you will not always have me .
NCB	Matthew	26	12	In pouring this ointment on my body , she has prepared me for burial .
NCB	Matthew	26	13	Amen , I say to you , wherever in the whole world this gospel is proclaimed , what she has done will be told in remembrance of her. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	14	Judas Betrays Jesus . [ f ] Then one of the Twelve , the man called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests
NCB	Matthew	26	15	and asked , “ What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you ? ” They paid him thirty pieces of silver ,
NCB	Matthew	26	16	and from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him .
NCB	Matthew	26	17	The Preparations for the Passover Supper . [ g ] On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread , [ h ] the disciples came to Jesus and asked , “ Where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the Passover ? ”
NCB	Matthew	26	18	to
NCB	Matthew	26	19	The disciples thereupon followed Jesus ’ instructions , and they prepared the Passover .
NCB	Matthew	26	20	The Treachery of Judas Foretold . [ i ] When evening came , he reclined at table with the Twelve .
NCB	Matthew	26	21	And while they were eating , he said , “ Amen , I say to you , one of you will betray me. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	22	Greatly distressed on hearing this , they began to ask him , one after another , “ Is it I , Lord ? ”
NCB	Matthew	26	23	He answered , “ The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me is the one who will betray me .
NCB	Matthew	26	24	The Son of Man indeed goes , as it is written of him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed . It would be better for that man if he had never been born. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas , the one who would betray him , said : “ Is it I , Rabbi ? ” Jesus replied , “ You have said so. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	27	Then he took a cup , and after offering thanks he gave it to them , saying , “ Drink from this , all of you .
NCB	Matthew	26	28	For this is my blood of the covenant , which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins .
NCB	Matthew	26	29	And I tell you , from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine until the day when I shall drink it anew with you in the kingdom of my Father. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	30	And after singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
NCB	Matthew	26	31	Jesus Predicts Peter ’ s Denial . [ k ] Then Jesus said to them , “ This very night you will all be scandalized because of me , for it is written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. ’
NCB	Matthew	26	32	But after I have been raised up , I shall go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	33	Peter said to him , “ Even if all the others will be scandalized because of you , I will never be. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	34	Jesus replied , “ Amen , I say to you , this very night , before the cock crows , you will deny me three times. ” [ l ]
NCB	Matthew	26	35	Peter said to him , “ Even if I have to die with you , I will not deny you. ” And all the other disciples said the same thing .
NCB	Matthew	26	36	. - Matthew 26:6 The anointing at Bethany anticipates the burial rites for the Savior after his death . Providing for burial was in the eyes of the Jews a more important good work than almsgiving itself . In Jn 12:1-8 , the woman is called Mary , and Judas is the apostle who becomes indignant . Luke ( 7:36-50 ) reports another anointing . - Matthew 26:11 The poor you will always have with you : with these words Jesus does not intend to sanction poverty as if to condemn efforts to eradicate misery . He makes a simple observation : his disciples will have many occasions to aid the poor who , as Deut 15:11 states , will never be wanting in Israel . - Matthew 26:14 For the early Christians , if there is a dark deed it is the ever incomprehensible deed of Judas , who comes to the fore here . Matthew is thinking of the prophecy of the righteous man sold for thirty pieces of silver ( see Zec 11:12 ) . That amount is also the compensation paid to one whose slave has been gored by an ox ( see Ex 21:32 ) . - Matthew 26:17 In the history of Israel one event dominates all others , the Passover ( Ex 12–13 ) , and in the worship of Israel one feast summarizes the whole faith , the Passover . It celebrates the passage of God in the midst of his people and is the hour of liberation , salvation , and the covenant . Jesus ’ Death and Resurrection constitute the true Passover , definitive for all humankind . The Last Supper of Jesus will be its inauguration . - Matthew 26:17 The first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread : this date corresponds with Thursday , the 14th of Nisan . The feast really began on the 15th of Nisan and lasted until the 21st . However , since the leavened bread was eliminated from all the houses before midday on the 14th , the morning of this date was improperly regarded as the first day of the feast , which in reality began only with the setting of the sun , when according to Jewish custom the 15th began . Passover here refers to the paschal lamb , which was immolated around three o ’ clock on the 14th of Nisan . - Matthew 26:20 The Passover supper began around six o ’ clock on Thursday . This passage focuses on the divine foreknowledge of Jesus , who is not overcome by the course of events and regards them as ordinary . He sees them as the putting in motion of the will of his Father . - Matthew 26:26 This is the beginning of the new Covenant promised in Jer 31:31-33 , the new sacrifice . For Jesus this meal is more than a final farewell ; his entire work is summed up in this sign . He shares his life and love with sinners ; he acts as the Servant of God whose sacrifice of himself ransoms his fellow human beings from sin and reconciles them with the Father ( see Isa 42:6 ; 49:6 ; 53:11-12 ) . Jesus anticipates his sacrifice ; he anticipates his gift of himself . By offering his body and blood on the cross he saves humankind . A Covenant is established in which all the saved will share in the same love ( see Jer 31:31-34 ) . The Eucharist replaces Sinai ( see Ex 24:6-8 ) . - Matthew 26:31 During the Passover meal , some psalms were sung , i.e. , the so-called Hallel ( 113–118 ) . Two followed the account of the origin of Passover . The others were recited after the meal . On the way to the Mount of Olives , Jesus predicts to the disciples their crisis of faith . They have indeed acknowledged him as Messiah and have a deep love for him , as shown by Peter ’ s words . However , they have not yet understood the scandal of the cross , and so their fidelity will be shaken , at least momentarily . - Matthew 26:34 The cock would begin crowing at 3:00 A.M. ( see Mk 13:35 ) . - Matthew 26:36 The first Christian community never succumbed to the temptation to make Jesus into a hero . Never did he appear more human and more pitiable than in this passage . His inner turmoil in the face of his approaching suffering and death could not be more profound than in this hour of the agony . Three times the prayer of the Our Father rises on the lips of Christ ; it is a prayer of complete abandonment into God ’ s hand . And Jesus bears this “ temptation , ” this trial , alone as perhaps no other human could have done . He utters no word of resentment or pride at the moment when he accepts and confronts the ultimate and sorrowful stage of his mission . - Matthew 26:47 Jesus practices what he had taught ( Mt 5:39 ) . He regards himself as the suffering Servant ( see Isa
NCB	Matthew	26	37	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and he began to suffer grief and anguish .
NCB	Matthew	26	38	Then he said to them , “ My soul is sorrowful , even to the point of death . Remain here and keep watch with me. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	39	Moving on a little farther , he threw himself prostrate on the ground in prayer , saying , “ My Father , if it is possible , allow this cup to be taken from me . Yet let your will , not mine , be done. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	40	Returning to the disciples , he found them sleeping . He said to Peter , “ Could you not keep watch with me for just one hour ?
NCB	Matthew	26	41	Stay awake and pray that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit is indeed willing , but the flesh is weak. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	42	He went apart for a second time and prayed , “ My Father , if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it , your will be done. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	43	Then he came back again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy .
NCB	Matthew	26	44	He left them there and went away again , praying for the third time in the same words as before .
NCB	Matthew	26	45	Then he returned to the disciples and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? Behold , the hour has come for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
NCB	Matthew	26	46	Get up ! Let us be going ! Look , my betrayer is approaching. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	47	Jesus Is Arrested . [ n ] [ o ] While he was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , arrived . With him there was a large crowd of men , armed with swords and clubs , who had been sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people .
NCB	Matthew	26	48	Now his betrayer had agreed with them on a signal , saying , “ The one I shall kiss is the man . Arrest him. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	49	Proceeding directly to Jesus , he said , “ Greetings , Rabbi ! ” and kissed him .
NCB	Matthew	26	50	Jesus said to him , “ Friend , do what you are here to do. ” Then they came forward , seized Jesus , and placed him under arrest .
NCB	Matthew	26	51	Suddenly , one of those who were accompanying Jesus reached for his sword , drew it , and struck a servant of the high priest , slicing off his ear .
NCB	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put back your sword into its place . For all who take the sword shall die by the sword .
NCB	Matthew	26	53	) who accepts his sacrifice in silence so as to accomplish his mission . It is love that reestablishes order , for in the face of hypocritical force violence remains powerless . - Matthew 26:47 Judas was well aware of the customs of his Master , and that he was wont to retire to the garden of Gethsemane . A kiss was the customary greeting of a disciple for his teacher . - Matthew 26:53 Do you suppose that I can not appeal to my Father for help . . . ? : by these words Jesus emphasizes the voluntary character of his Passion . Jesus freely accepts the will of God , expressed in Scripture . The same reason is repeated in v.
NCB	Matthew	26	54	But then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way ? ”
NCB	Matthew	26	55	At that hour , Jesus said to the crowd , “ Why are you coming forth with swords and clubs to arrest me , as though I were a bandit ? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple , and you did not arrest me .
NCB	Matthew	26	56	. Twelve legions : a Roman legion consisted of
NCB	Matthew	26	57	Jesus Is Condemned by the Sanhedrin . [ q ] Those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders had gathered .
NCB	Matthew	26	58	Meanwhile , Peter followed him at a distance up to the courtyard of the high priest . Then , going inside , he sat down with the attendants to see what the outcome would be .
NCB	Matthew	26	59	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin tried to elicit some false testimony against Jesus so they could put him to death ,
NCB	Matthew	26	60	but they failed in their efforts , even though many witnesses came forward with perjured testimony . Finally , two men came forward
NCB	Matthew	26	61	who stated , “ This man said , ‘ I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it within three days. ’ ”
NCB	Matthew	26	62	The high priest then rose and said to him , “ Have you no reply to counter the testimony that these witnesses have given ? ”
NCB	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus remained silent . Then the high priest said to him , “ I command you to tell us before the living God whether you are the Christ , the Son of God. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	64	Jesus replied , “ You have said it . But I tell you : From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his robes and exclaimed , “ He has blasphemed ! What need do we have for any further witnesses ? Behold , you have just heard the blasphemy .
NCB	Matthew	26	66	What do you think ? ” They shouted in reply , “ He deserves to die. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	67	Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists . Some taunted him as they beat him ,
NCB	Matthew	26	68	“ Prophesy to us , Christ ! Who hit you ? ”
NCB	Matthew	26	69	Peter Denies Jesus . [ r ] Meanwhile , Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . One of the servant girls came over to him and said , “ You too were with Jesus the Galilean. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	70	But he denied it before all of them , saying , “ I do not know what you are talking about. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	71	When he walked out to the entrance gate , another servant girl caught sight of him and said to the people around her , “ This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied it , this time with an oath : “ I do not know the man. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	73	Shortly afterward , some bystanders came up to Peter and said to him , “ You unquestionably are one of them . Even your accent gives you away. ”
NCB	Matthew	26	74	Then Peter began to shout curses , and he swore an oath : “ I do not know the man. ” At that very moment , a cock crowed ,
NCB	Matthew	26	75	and Peter remembered what Jesus had said : “ Before the cock crows , you will deny me three times. ” And he went outside and began to weep uncontrollably . Footnotes - Matthew 26:1 One person dominates this account : Jesus . He submits to the death that hangs over sinful humanity , but he comes forth from the tomb as conqueror of death and evil . Matthew constantly cites Scripture in order to convince the intended readers of his work , Christians converted from Judaism , that the seeming failure of Jesus was in reality the fulfillment of God ’ s plan . - Matthew 26:1 Matthew emphasizes Jesus ’ awareness to carry out his Father ’ s saving plan . Probably the plot was hatched on Wednesday . - Matthew 26:3 Joseph , surnamed Caiaphas , son-in-law of Annas , was high priest , that is , supreme head of the Jewish priesthood and president of the Sanhedrin , from A.D.
NCB	Matthew	26	6000	men . - Matthew 26:57 According to Matthew and Mark , immediately after his arrest Jesus was led before the Sanhedrin for a session that very night . Another session was held in the morning ; then Jesus was consigned to Pilate . The religious trial has two phases : the first centers upon the false testimony of the witnesses , the second upon the question put to Jesus by the high priest . The Law ( Deut 17:6 ) required that two witnesses agree in their testimony against an accused person . Jesus supposedly had said that he had power over the temple , which was the house of God . But had he not said that his body was the true dwelling of the Father ( Jn 2:21 ) ? Now that every political and nationalist interpretation of his words seems excluded , since he is alone , rejected , helpless , he dares to say that he is the Messiah and not only the son but the lord of David ( Ps 110:1 ; Dan 7:13 ) . - Matthew 26:69 At the very moment when the Master openly proclaims himself to be the Messiah , no one acknowledges it . In the opinion of all , he is lost . Even Peter , the leader of Jesus ’ followers , denies any link with him .
NCB	Matthew	27	27	Jesus Is Crowned with Thorns . [ j ] Then the governor ’ s soldiers took Jesus inside the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him .
NCB	Matthew	27	1	When morning came , all the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in council to decide how to put him to death .
NCB	Matthew	27	2	They bound him and led him away , and handed him over to Pilate , the governor . Judas Hangs Himself . [ b ]
NCB	Matthew	27	3	When Judas discovered that Jesus , whom he betrayed , had been condemned he was seized with a sense of remorse , and he brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders .
NCB	Matthew	27	4	“ I have sinned , ” he said , “ for I have betrayed innocent blood. ” They replied , “ Of what importance is that to us ? That is your responsibility. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	5	Flinging the silver pieces into the temple , he departed . Then he went off and hanged himself .
NCB	Matthew	27	6	. - Matthew 27:3 This story is typical of Matthew ’ s style ; the sad incident suggests to him various references to the Scriptures ( Zec 11:12-13 ; Jer 18:2-3 ; 32:6-15 ) . The memory of Judas was a burden to the early Christians ( see Acts 1:16-20 ) . - Matthew 27:9 Spoken through the prophet Jeremiah : the statement actually comes from Zec 11:12 ,
NCB	Matthew	27	7	and
NCB	Matthew	27	8	This is the reason why that field to this very day is called the Field of Blood .
NCB	Matthew	27	9	Thus was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah : [ c ] “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price set on his head by the people of Israel ,
NCB	Matthew	27	10	and they used them to purchase the potter ’ s field as the Lord had commanded me. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	11	Jesus Is Questioned by Pilate . [ d ] Meanwhile , Jesus was brought into the presence of the governor , who asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” Jesus replied , “ You have said so. ” [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	27	12	And when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders , he offered no reply .
NCB	Matthew	27	13	,
NCB	Matthew	27	14	But he did not offer a single word in response , much to the governor ’ s amazement . [ f ]
NCB	Matthew	27	15	Jesus Is Sentenced to Death . Now on the occasion of the feast , the governor ’ s custom was to release to the people one prisoner whom they had designated .
NCB	Matthew	27	16	At that particular time , they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Barabbas .
NCB	Matthew	27	17	Therefore , after the people had gathered , Pilate asked them , “ Which man do you want me to release to you : Barabbas , or Jesus who is called the Christ ? ”
NCB	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that it was out of envy that they had handed him over .
NCB	Matthew	27	19	,
NCB	Matthew	27	20	Meanwhile , the chief priests and the elders had persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas and to have Jesus executed .
NCB	Matthew	27	21	) . - Matthew 27:46 Midday . . . three o ’ clock : literally , “ the sixth hour ” . . . “ the ninth hour. ” Psalm
NCB	Matthew	27	22	, whose first verse is here invoked by Jesus , recapitulates all the sufferings of the just people in the Old Testament . It clearly expresses their extreme anguish but also their certainty of final vindication . - Matthew 27:53 The phenomena that accompany the death of Jesus evoke the apocalyptic literary genre of the Day of the Lord . In fact , according to the evangelists , that day corresponds with the day of the death of Jesus , which signals the beginning of the new era . Because of the obscurity of this language it is difficult to determine the historicity of the resurrection of some dead people mentioned here . Some Fathers of the Church and exegetes believe this passage refers to the liberation from limbo of the just of the Old Testament , who then enter with Jesus into the glory of the heavenly Jerusalem . - Matthew 27:56 Magdalene : “ Of Magdala , ” a place on the west side of Lake Tiberias , near Capernaum . - Matthew 27:57 The story of the burial provided by a rich man certainly recalls Isaiah ’ s prophecy of the Servant ( 53:9 LXX ) . See also note on Mk 15:42-47 . - Matthew 27:62 Preparation day : this was Friday , the day on which the meal was prepared for the Sabbath , which was a day of complete rest .
NCB	Matthew	27	23	He asked , “ Why ? What evil has he done ? ” But they only screamed all the louder , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
NCB	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere and that a riot was about to occur , he took some water and washed his hands [ h ] in full view of the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of this man ’ s blood . It is your responsibility. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	25	With one voice the entire crowd cried out , “ Let his blood be on us and on our children ! ” [ i ]
NCB	Matthew	27	26	to
NCB	Matthew	27	28	They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him ,
NCB	Matthew	27	29	and after twisting some thorns into a crown , they placed it on his head and put a reed in his right hand . Then , bending the knee before him , they mocked him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NCB	Matthew	27	30	They also spat upon him and , taking the reed , used it to strike him on the head .
NCB	Matthew	27	31	And when they had finished mocking him , they stripped him of the robe , dressed him in his own clothes , and led him away to crucify him .
NCB	Matthew	27	32	The Way of the Cross . As they went out , they encountered a man from Cyrene , [ k ] named Simon , and they forced him to carry the cross .
NCB	Matthew	27	33	Jesus Is Crucified on Calvary . When they came to a place called Golgotha , which means the Place of the Skull , [ l ]
NCB	Matthew	27	34	they offered him some wine to drink that had been mixed with gall ; but after tasting it , he refused to drink the mixture . [ m ]
NCB	Matthew	27	35	And after they had crucified him , [ n ] they divided his garments among them by casting lots .
NCB	Matthew	27	36	was the governor ( procurator ) in Judea , which passed into the direct dominion of Rome in A.D.
NCB	Matthew	27	37	; Dan 12:2 ; Rev
NCB	Matthew	27	38	Two thieves were crucified with him , one on his right and the other on his left . [ o ]
NCB	Matthew	27	39	Those people who passed by jeered at him , shaking their heads
NCB	Matthew	27	40	and saying , “ You who claimed you could destroy the temple and rebuild it within three days , save yourself ! If you truly are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! ”
NCB	Matthew	27	41	In much the same way , the chief priests , together with the scribes and the elders , joined in the mockery , saying ,
NCB	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others , but he can not save himself . If he is the king of Israel , let him come down from the cross right now , and we will believe in him .
NCB	Matthew	27	43	He trusted in God ; now let God deliver him if he wants him , for he said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
NCB	Matthew	27	44	The thieves who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way .
NCB	Matthew	27	45	Jesus Dies on the Cross . [ p ] Beginning at midday , there was darkness over the whole land until three in the afternoon .
NCB	Matthew	27	46	And about three o ’ clock [ q ] Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” —that is , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
NCB	Matthew	27	47	On hearing this , some of the bystanders said , “ This man is calling for Elijah. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	48	One of them immediately ran off to get a sponge , which he soaked in vinegar , put on a stick , and gave to him to drink .
NCB	Matthew	27	49	But the others said , “ Wait ! Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	50	Then Jesus again cried out in a loud voice and gave up his spirit .
NCB	Matthew	27	51	And behold , the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom . The earth quaked and rocks were split apart .
NCB	Matthew	27	52	The tombs were opened , and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised .
NCB	Matthew	27	53	And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection , they entered the holy city and appeared to many . [ r ]
NCB	Matthew	27	54	Now when the centurion and those who were keeping watch over Jesus with him witnessed the earthquake and all that was happening , they were terrified , and they said , “ Truly , this man was the Son of God. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	55	Many women were also present , looking on from a distance . They had followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to him .
NCB	Matthew	27	56	Among these were Mary Magdalene , [ s ] Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee .
NCB	Matthew	27	57	Jesus Is Placed in the Tomb . [ t ] When evening came , there arrived a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph , who had himself become a disciple of Jesus .
NCB	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus . So Pilate ordered that it be handed over to him .
NCB	Matthew	27	59	Joseph took the body , wrapped it in a clean linen shroud ,
NCB	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his own new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock . He then rolled an immense stone against the entrance of the tomb and departed .
NCB	Matthew	27	61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there , sitting opposite the sepulcher .
NCB	Matthew	27	62	The Guard at the Tomb . The next day , on the morning after the preparation day , [ u ] the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate in a group
NCB	Matthew	27	63	and said to him , “ Your Excellency , we recall that while he was still alive , this impostor said , ‘ After three days I will be raised up. ’
NCB	Matthew	27	64	Therefore , issue orders that the tomb be kept under surveillance until the third day . Otherwise , his disciples may go there and steal his body , and then tell the people , ‘ He has been raised from the dead. ’ This final deception would be worse than the first. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ You have a guard . Go and make the grave as secure as you can. ”
NCB	Matthew	27	66	, sheds light on the position of those nailed to the cross . A few late manuscripts add here : “ lots , ” so that the word spoken by the Prophet might be fulfilled : ‘ They divide my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots ’ ” ( Ps 22:19 ) . - Matthew 27:38 The crucifixion between two thieves recalls the prophecy of Isa 53:12 : “ He was counted among the transgressors. ” - Matthew 27:45 Everything proclaims that the Son of God , dying on the cross , is triumphant over the forces of the world and of death ; the old covenant is finished , and the time is coming when the kingdom will be open to all human beings ( see Heb 9:12 ; 10:20 ; Ezek
NCB	Matthew	28	28	Jesus Is Raised from the Dead . [ a ]
NCB	Matthew	28	1	Cor 15:8 ) . - Matthew 28:11 Matthew is here combating the fables that were circulated in Jewish circles to ridicule the testimony of the early Church . - Matthew 28:16 The last passage of the Gospel is not a conclusion but a new beginning , a new departure . From a mountain whose vantage point embraces the ends of the earth and the limits of history , we see the destiny of humankind . Now Jesus is established in his lordship in dazzling glory , and his hands hold the fate of the world . Now his faithful spread his message and his mystery ; now there is one Baptism for all humanity and one communion with God for all persons . It is the time of the universal mission : God is with us ; such is the very name of Jesus : “ Emmanuel ” ( Mt 1:23 ; see Isa 7:14 ) . On the face of Christ we read the mystery of the Church . - Matthew 28:19 The evangelist places on the Lord ’ s lips the trinitarian formula that was in use in the baptismal Liturgy of the time ( A.D. 70–80 ) .

NCB	Matthew	28	11	The Report of the Guard . [ c ] While the women were on their way , some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened .
NCB	Matthew	28	12	After the chief priests had conferred with the elders , they presented a large sum of money to the soldiers
NCB	Matthew	28	13	and gave them this order : “ Say , ‘ His disciples came by night and stole the body while we were asleep. ’
NCB	Matthew	28	14	And should the governor hear anything in this regard , we will explain the situation to him and you will be safe. ”
NCB	Matthew	28	15	The soldiers took the money and did as they had been instructed . And this story is still circulated among the Jews to this very day .
NCB	Matthew	28	16	Jesus Gives the Great Commission . [ d ] Then the eleven disciples set out for Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had told them to meet him .
NCB	Matthew	28	17	When they saw him , they prostrated themselves before him , although some doubted .
NCB	Matthew	28	18	Then Jesus approached them and said , “ All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
NCB	Matthew	28	19	Go , therefore , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , [ e ]
NCB	Matthew	28	20	and teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you . And behold , I am with you always , to the end of the world. ” Footnotes - Matthew 28:1 The Resurrection of Christ is a mystery of faith ; it was not accessible to the senses , as other events are . Our faith in it is based on the word of those who witnessed the risen Christ . - Matthew 28:10 It is difficult to harmonize the accounts of the appearances of the risen Jesus set forth by the four evangelists and St. Paul (

NCB	Mark	1	2	) the Son is baptized ; and (
NCB	Mark	1	3	) the Holy Spirit descends on the Son . - Mark 1:12 Jesus is already committed to his mission of combating Satan , the representative of all the forces of evil that batter humanity . - Mark 1:14 People had a simple idea of the Messiah as a glorious figure : they were expecting a national hero , a political liberator , a restorer of their independence and their public worship , a leader who would bring Israel to world domination . But the reason why Jesus comes before the nation is quite different . This first part of Mark ’ s Gospel describes three periods . Three times the author gives a general summary of the activity of Jesus and describes a mission of the disciples ; each period ends with a scene of hostility and lack of understanding . At the end of this first half of the book , the confession of Peter at Caesarea recognizes the Messiah without any misunderstanding . From that point on , the road will lead to the Passion ; that development occupies the second half of the Gospel . - Mark 1:14 After John had been arrested : the ministry of Jesus begins under the sign of his precursor ’ s martyrdom . This simple chronological marker is a veiled prefiguration of the suffering and death that await the Messiah . See note on Lk 3:20 . - Mark 1:16 See note on Mt 4:18-22 . - Mark 1:21 See note on Lk 4:31-41 . - Mark 1:24 The Holy One of God : this title is used only here and in Lk 4:34 and Jn 6:69 . It refers more to Jesus ’ divinity than to his Messiahship ( see Lk 1:35 ) . - Mark 1:30 Simon ’ s mother-in-law : Paul ( in
NCB	Mark	1	4	Hence , John the Baptist appeared in the desert , proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
NCB	Mark	1	5	People from the entire Judean countryside and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him , and as they confessed their sins they were baptized by him in the Jordan River .
NCB	Mark	1	6	John was clothed in a garment of camel ’ s hair , with a leather belt around his waist , and his food consisted of locusts and wild honey .
NCB	Mark	1	7	And this was the message he proclaimed : “ One who is far more powerful than I am is coming after me . I am not worthy even to stoop down and loosen the straps of his sandals .
NCB	Mark	1	8	I have baptized you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ” [ d ] Jesus Is Baptized by John . [ e ]
NCB	Mark	1	9	At that time , [ f ] Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan .
NCB	Mark	1	10	[ g ] And as he was coming up out of the water , he beheld the heavens break open and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove .
NCB	Mark	1	11	And a voice came from heaven : “ You are my beloved Son ; in you I am well pleased. ”
NCB	Mark	1	12	Jesus Is Tempted in the Desert . [ h ] The Spirit immediately drove him out into the desert .
NCB	Mark	1	13	He remained there for forty days , during which time he was tempted by Satan . He lived there among the wild beasts , while the angels ministered to him . Is Jesus the Messiah ? [ i ] First Testimonies of the Messiah ’ s Mission
NCB	Mark	1	14	Jesus Inaugurates His Mission . After John had been arrested , [ j ] Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God , and saying ,
NCB	Mark	1	15	“ The time of fulfillment has arrived , and the kingdom of God is close at hand . Repent , and believe in the gospel. ”
NCB	Mark	1	16	The First Disciples . [ k ] As Jesus was walking along by the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea , for they were fishermen .
NCB	Mark	1	17	Jesus said to them , “ Come , follow me , and I will make you fishers of men. ”
NCB	Mark	1	18	Immediately , they abandoned their nets and followed him .
NCB	Mark	1	19	As he proceeded farther , he saw James , the son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They also were in a boat mending their nets .
NCB	Mark	1	20	Immediately , he called them , and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers and followed him .
NCB	Mark	1	21	Jesus Heals a Man with a Demon . [ l ] They journeyed to Capernaum , and on the Sabbath Jesus immediately entered the synagogue and began to instruct the people .
NCB	Mark	1	22	They were astounded at his teaching , for he taught them as one who had authority , and not as the scribes .
NCB	Mark	1	23	In that synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit , and he shrieked ,
NCB	Mark	1	24	“ What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are—the Holy One of God. ” [ m ]
NCB	Mark	1	25	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent , and come out of him ! ”
NCB	Mark	1	26	The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and with a loud cry emerged from him .
NCB	Mark	1	27	at approximately
NCB	Mark	1	28	His reputation quickly began to spread everywhere throughout the entire region of Galilee .
NCB	Mark	1	29	Jesus Heals Peter ’ s Mother-in-Law . Immediately on leaving the synagogue , he went with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew .
NCB	Mark	1	30	years of age ( see Lk 3:23 ) . Nazareth : see note on Mt 2:23 . Baptized by John : see note on Mt 3:15 for the meaning of Jesus ’ baptism . - Mark 1:10 This passage has the involvement of all three persons of the Trinity : (
NCB	Mark	1	31	Jesus approached her , grasped her by the hand , and helped her up . Then the fever left her , and she began to serve them .
NCB	Mark	1	32	Other Healings . That evening , after sunset , they brought to him all those who were sick or possessed by demons . [ o ]
NCB	Mark	1	33	The whole town was present , crowded around the door .
NCB	Mark	1	34	He cured many who were afflicted with various diseases , and he drove out many demons , although he would not permit them to speak because they knew who he was .
NCB	Mark	1	35	Jesus Proclaims the Message and Heals the Sick . Early the next morning , long before dawn , he arose and went off to a secluded place , where he prayed .
NCB	Mark	1	36	Simon and his companions set forth in search of him ,
NCB	Mark	1	37	and when they found him they said , “ Everybody is looking for you. ”
NCB	Mark	1	38	He replied , “ Let us move on to the neighboring towns so that I may proclaim the message there as well . For this is the reason why I came. ”
NCB	Mark	1	39	Then he traveled all throughout Galilee , preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons .
NCB	Mark	1	40	Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy . A man with leprosy [ p ] approached and , kneeling before him , begged him , “ If you choose to do so , you can make me clean. ”
NCB	Mark	1	41	Moved with pity , “ he stretched out his hand and touched him , [ q ] saying , “ I do choose . Be made clean ! ”
NCB	Mark	1	42	Immediately , the leprosy left him and he was cured .
NCB	Mark	1	43	Jesus then sent him away at once , after first sternly warning him ,
NCB	Mark	1	44	“ See that you tell no one anything about this . Just go and show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed . That will be proof for them. ” [ r ]
NCB	Mark	1	45	However , he went forth and began to proclaim the entire story , spreading the word far and wide . As a result , Jesus could no longer go openly into any town . Rather , he stayed outside in deserted places , and people continued to come to him from every quarter . Footnotes - Mark 1:1 Around the year
NCB	Mark	2	2	Such large multitudes gathered there that no longer was any space available , even in front of the door , and he was preaching the word to them .
NCB	Mark	2	1	Sam 21:2-3 his father , Ahimelech , is named . - Mark 2:27 Mark alone has preserved this saying of Jesus .
NCB	Mark	2	3	Some people arrived , bringing to him a man who was paralyzed , carried by four men .
NCB	Mark	2	4	Since they were unable to bring him near Jesus because of the crowd , they made an opening in the roof above him and then lowered the bed on which the paralyzed man was lying .
NCB	Mark	2	5	On perceiving their faith , Jesus said to the paralyzed man , “ Son , your sins are forgiven. ”
NCB	Mark	2	6	Now some scribes [ b ] were sitting there , thinking to themselves :
NCB	Mark	2	7	“ How can this man say such things ? He is blaspheming ! Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
NCB	Mark	2	8	Jesus was able immediately to discern in his spirit what they were thinking , and he asked , “ Why do you entertain such thoughts in your hearts ?
NCB	Mark	2	9	Which is easier : to say to the paralyzed man , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say : ‘ Stand up , take your mat , and walk ’ ?
NCB	Mark	2	10	But that you may come to realize that the Son of Man [ c ] has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the paralyzed man—
NCB	Mark	2	11	“ I say to you , stand up , take your bed , and go to your home. ”
NCB	Mark	2	12	The man stood up , immediately picked up his bed , and went off in full view of all of them . The onlookers were all astonished and they glorified God , saying , “ We have never before witnessed anything like this. ”
NCB	Mark	2	13	Jesus Calls Levi ( Matthew ) . Once again Jesus went out to the shore of the lake , [ d ] and as a large crowd came to him , he taught them .
NCB	Mark	2	14	As he was walking along , he saw Levi [ e ] the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector ’ s booth . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ” and he got up and followed him .
NCB	Mark	2	15	Jesus Eats with Sinners . When he was sitting at dinner in his [ f ] house , many tax collectors and sinners were seated with him and his disciples , for there were many who followed Jesus .
NCB	Mark	2	16	Some scribes who were Pharisees noticed that Jesus was eating with sinners and tax collectors , and they asked his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NCB	Mark	2	17	When Jesus overheard this remark , he said , “ It is not the healthy who need a physician , but rather those who are sick . I have come to call not the righteous but sinners. ”
NCB	Mark	2	18	A Time of Joy and Grace . [ g ] John ’ s disciples and the Pharisees were observing a fast . Some people came to Jesus and asked , “ Why do John ’ s disciples and those of the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not do so ? ”
NCB	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered , “ How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
NCB	Mark	2	20	But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then on that day they will fast . [ h ]
NCB	Mark	2	21	“ No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak . If he does , the patch tears away from it , the new from the old , and a worse tear results .
NCB	Mark	2	22	Nor does anyone pour new wine [ i ] into old wineskins . If he does , the wine will burst the skins , and then the wine and the skins are both lost . Rather , new wine is poured into fresh wineskins. ”
NCB	Mark	2	23	Picking Grain on the Sabbath . [ j ] One day , as Jesus was passing through a field of grain on the Sabbath , his disciples began to pick some heads of grain as they walked along .
NCB	Mark	2	24	The Pharisees said to him , “ Behold , why are your disciples doing what is forbidden on the Sabbath ? ”
NCB	Mark	2	25	He answered , “ Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food ?
NCB	Mark	2	26	He entered the house of God when Abiathar [ k ] was high priest and ate the sacred bread that only the priests were permitted to eat , and he shared it with his companions. ”
NCB	Mark	2	27	Then he said to them , “ The Sabbath was made for man , not man for the Sabbath . [ l ]
NCB	Mark	2	28	That is why the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath. ” Footnotes - Mark 2:1 In the five controversy stories that are combined here , the plot to put Jesus to death , which is the key to Mark ’ s Gospel , is already made clear . - Mark 2:6 Scribes : men trained in the oral traditions that flowed from the written Law . In this Gospel , they are adversaries of Jesus except in one incident ( Mk 12:28-34 ) . - Mark 2:10 Son of Man : see note on Mt 8:20 . - Mark 2:13 Lake : Tiberias . - Mark 2:14 Levi : another name of Matthew ( Jews often had two names ) .

The system was established by the Romans , but the collection of taxes and duties was handed over to private organizations whose employees were not infrequently corrupt . See also note on Mt 5:46 . - Mark 2:15 His : i.e. , Levi ’ s ( see Lk 5:29 ) . Sinners : those who were ostentatiously wicked and those who did not follow the Law as interpreted by the scribes . The term was customarily applied to collaborators , robbers , adulterers , and the like . - Mark 2:18 See notes on Mt 9:14-17 and Lk 5:33-39 . - Mark 2:20 The Jews were obliged to fast only on the Day of Atonement . However , devout persons fasted two times a week ( on Monday and Thursday ) . Jesus does not disapprove of such acts . He merely points out that his coming has inaugurated the time of joy foretold by the Prophets , in which it was legitimate for his disciples to benefit from the presence of the Bridegroom , i.e. , the Messiah . He then alludes to his violent death after which his disciples would fast while awaiting the glorious and definitive coming of the heavenly Bridegroom . - Mark 2:22 New wine : the Gospel ; the old wine is the practices of Judaism . - Mark 2:23 See notes on Mt 12:2 ; 12:3-4 ; 12:5-6 ; and 12:8 . - Mark 2:26 Abiathar : high priest in the time of David . In
NCB	Mark	3	3	He said to the man with the withered hand , “ Come here. ”
NCB	Mark	3	1	Again , Jesus entered the synagogue , and a man was there who had a withered hand .
NCB	Mark	3	2	They watched him closely to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath so that they might accuse him .
NCB	Mark	3	4	Then he said to the onlookers , “ Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath , to save life or to kill ? ” But they offered no reply .
NCB	Mark	3	5	Looking at them with anger , he was saddened at the hardness of their hearts , and he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He stretched it out , and his hand was restored .

NCB	Mark	3	7	Thereupon Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lakeshore , and a great multitude of people from Galilee followed him .
NCB	Mark	3	8	In addition , having heard of all he was doing , large numbers also came to him from Judea , Jerusalem , Idumea , beyond the Jordan , and the region of Tyre and Sidon . [ d ]
NCB	Mark	3	9	He instructed his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so that he would not be crushed by the crowds .
NCB	Mark	3	10	For he had healed so many that all who were afflicted in any way came crowding around to touch him .

The order in which the names are given varies , but Peter always comes first and Judas is always placed at the end . - Mark 3:14 Whom he also named apostles : missing in some manuscripts . - Mark 3:17 Sons of Thunder : the Aramaic nickname emphasizes the fiery character of the two brothers . - Mark 3:20 In these verses , which are peculiar to Mark ’ s Gospel , the author highlights contrasting reactions to the person of Jesus . The crowds search him out . His relatives think he is out of his mind and understand nothing about his mission ; they want to take him by force and bring him back to his own town . - Mark 3:20 The foundation of the eschatological community is followed by this passage , which recounts the failure to comprehend even on the part of relatives and above all the hostile refusal of the leaders of Judaism to accept him . - Mark 3:20 Home : i.e. , Matthew ’ s house ( see Mt 2:15 ) . - Mark 3:22 See notes on Mt 12:22-32 and 12:32 . - Mark 3:31 See notes on Mt 12:46-50 and 12:47 .
NCB	Mark	3	13	Jesus Establishes the Group of the Disciples . [ e ] Jesus then went up onto the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted , and they came to him .
NCB	Mark	3	14	[ f ] He appointed twelve—whom he also named apostles— [ g ] that they might be his companions and that he might send them out to proclaim the message ,
NCB	Mark	3	15	with the authority to drive out demons .
NCB	Mark	3	16	The twelve he appointed were : Simon , to whom he gave the name Peter ;
NCB	Mark	3	17	James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James , to whom he gave the name Boanerges , that is , “ Sons of Thunder ” ; [ h ]
NCB	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus ; Thaddaeus , Simon the Zealot ,
NCB	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot , who betrayed him . Contrasting Reactions to the Person of Jesus [ i ]
NCB	Mark	3	20	The Concern of Jesus ’ Relatives . [ j ] Jesus then returned home , [ k ] and once again such a great crowd collected around them that they did not even find it possible to eat .
NCB	Mark	3	21	When his relatives heard about this , they went out to take charge of him , saying , “ He has gone out of his mind. ”
NCB	Mark	3	22	The Blasphemy of the Scribes . [ l ] Meanwhile , the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said , “ He is possessed by Beelzebul , ” and “ He casts out demons by the prince of demons. ”
NCB	Mark	3	23	Summoning them to him , he spoke to them in parables , “ How can Satan drive out Satan ?
NCB	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not survive .
NCB	Mark	3	25	And if a household is divided against itself , that household will not be able to survive .
NCB	Mark	3	26	If Satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he can not survive ; he is doomed .
NCB	Mark	3	27	“ But no one can break into a strong man ’ s house and steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man ; then he can ransack the house .
NCB	Mark	3	28	“ Amen , I say to you , all sins that people commit and whatever blasphemies they utter will be forgiven .
NCB	Mark	3	29	But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven ; he is guilty of an eternal sin. ”
NCB	Mark	3	30	He said this because they had claimed he was possessed by an unclean spirit .
NCB	Mark	3	31	) , Judea ( 10:1 ) , and Jerusalem ( 11:11 ) . Idumea : the Greek form of the Hebrew “ Edom ” ; but here it refers to an area in western Palestine south of Judea rather than the earlier Edomite territory . - Mark 3:13 Among those who listened to Jesus there was a group that included women and
NCB	Mark	3	32	A crowd was sitting around him , and they said , “ Behold , your mother and your brethren are outside asking for you. ”
NCB	Mark	3	33	He replied , “ Who are my mother and my brethren ? ”
NCB	Mark	3	34	Then , looking around at those who were near him , he said : “ Behold , my mother and my brethren .
NCB	Mark	3	35	Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - Mark 3:1 See note on Mt 12:9-14 . - Mark 3:7 This is the second period in the first half of the Gospel . A group of disciples has been formed ; to these men who are really listening to him Jesus explains his message of the coming kingdom . - Mark 3:7 Mark begins this second section with a summary of the activity of Jesus . - Mark 3:8 This verse demonstrates Jesus ’ great popularity with people from all of Israel as well as its surrounding neighbors . Mark recounts Jesus ’ work in all the regions mentioned except Idumea : Galilee ( 1:14 ) , the region beyond the Jordan ( 5:1 ; 10:1 ) , Tyre and Sidon ( 7:24 ,
NCB	Mark	3	72	men who were later sent on mission ( see Lk 10:17 ) . Following the Ascension , the group had swelled to
NCB	Mark	3	120	believers who waited in Jerusalem ( Acts 1:15 ) . From such followers , Jesus here chooses
NCB	Mark	4	4	As he sowed , some seed fell on the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
NCB	Mark	4	1	On another occasion he began to teach by the side of the lake . However , such a large crowd gathered that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake , while the whole crowd gathered on the shore facing the lake .
NCB	Mark	4	2	Then he taught them many things in parables . In the course of his teaching , he said to them :
NCB	Mark	4	3	“ Listen ! A sower went out to sow .
NCB	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground , where there was little soil . It sprouted quickly , since the soil had no depth ,
NCB	Mark	4	6	but when the sun rose , it was scorched , and since it lacked roots , it withered away .
NCB	Mark	4	7	Other seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it produced no crop .
NCB	Mark	4	8	But some seed fell onto rich soil and brought forth grain , increasing and yielding thirty , sixty , and a hundred times what was sown. ”
NCB	Mark	4	9	He then added , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
NCB	Mark	4	10	The Reason for Parables . When he was alone , the Twelve and his other companions asked him about the parables .
NCB	Mark	4	11	He told them , “ To you has been granted knowledge of the mysteries [ b ] of the kingdom of God , but to those outside , everything comes in parables ,
NCB	Mark	4	12	. Jesus with his parables adapted himself to the imaginative eastern mentality , without running afoul of the susceptibility of that people who were still stubbornly attached to the idea of a triumphal Messiah . He offered the possibility of reflections and further elucidations . - Mark 4:35 The so-called “ Parables of the Lake ” are followed by a characteristic grouping of four miracles , which demonstrate the evangelist ’ s Christological intention . With his merciful power , Jesus appears as the Master of natural elements , demons , sickness , and death itself . The section gives a very accurate selection of prodigies worked by the Savior . The accounts are possibly pre-Marcan , and they have been endowed by the evangelist with a particularly vivid narrative taken from the preaching of Peter . These are the so-called “ Miracles of the Lake. ” - Mark 4:35 See note on Mt 8:23-27 .
NCB	Mark	4	13	The Explanation of the Parable of the Sower . [ d ] He went on to say to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? How then are you to understand any of the parables ?
NCB	Mark	4	14	What the sower is sowing is the word .
NCB	Mark	4	15	“ Some people are like seed that falls along the path where the word is sown . As soon as they hear it , Satan immediately comes and carries off the word that has been sown in them .
NCB	Mark	4	16	“ Others are like the seed sown on rocky ground . As soon as they hear the word they immediately receive it with joy .
NCB	Mark	4	17	But they have no deep root and they endure for only a short time . When some trial or tribulation arises on account of the word , they immediately fall away .
NCB	Mark	4	18	“ Those sown among thorns are the ones who hear the word ,
NCB	Mark	4	19	but worldly cares , the lure of riches , and the desire for other things come in and choke the word , and it bears no fruit .
NCB	Mark	4	20	“ But those sown in rich soil are those who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit and yield thirty or sixty or a hundred times what was sown. ”
NCB	Mark	4	21	The Parable of the Lamp . [ e ] He said to them , “ Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed ? To the contrary , it is placed on a lampstand .
NCB	Mark	4	22	For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed , and nothing is secret that will not be brought to light .
NCB	Mark	4	23	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear ! ”
NCB	Mark	4	24	The Parable of the Measure . [ f ] He also told them , “ Pay careful attention to what you hear . The measure you give will be the measure you will receive , and you will receive more in addition .
NCB	Mark	4	25	To the one who has , more will be given ; from the one who does not have , even what little he has will be taken away. ” [ g ]
NCB	Mark	4	26	The Parable of the Secretly Growing Seed . [ h ] He went on to say , “ The kingdom of God is like this . A man scatters seed on the ground .
NCB	Mark	4	27	Night and day , while he sleeps and while he is awake , the seed sprouts and grows , though he does not understand how .
NCB	Mark	4	28	The ground produces fruit of its own accord—first the shoot , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
NCB	Mark	4	29	And when the crop is ripe , he immediately stretches out the sickle , because the time for harvest has come. ”
NCB	Mark	4	30	The Parable of the Mustard Seed . [ i ] He then said , “ With what shall we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable can we use to explain it ?
NCB	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed that , when it is sown in the ground , is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth .
NCB	Mark	4	32	But once it is sown , it springs up and becomes the greatest of all plants , and it puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade. ”
NCB	Mark	4	33	The Usefulness of Parables . [ j ] With many such parables as these he spoke the word to them so far as they were able to comprehend it .
NCB	Mark	4	34	He never spoke to them except in parables , but he explained everything to his disciples when they were by themselves . Jesus Overcomes Evil and Effects Salvation [ k ]
NCB	Mark	4	35	Jesus Calms the Storm . [ l ] On that day , as evening approached , he said to them , “ Let us cross over to the other side. ”
NCB	Mark	4	36	And so , leaving the crowd behind , they took him with them in the boat just as he was . Some other boats joined them .
NCB	Mark	4	37	Suddenly , a great storm came up , and the waves were crashing over the boat so that it was almost swamped .
NCB	Mark	4	38	Jesus was in the stern , asleep on a cushion . They awakened him and said , “ Teacher , do you not care that we are perishing ? ”
NCB	Mark	4	39	Then he stood up and rebuked the wind , and he said to the sea , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” The wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
NCB	Mark	4	40	He said to them , “ Why are you so frightened ? Are you still without faith ? ”
NCB	Mark	4	41	They were filled with awe and said to one another , “ Who can this be ? Even the wind and the sea obey him. ” Footnotes - Mark 4:1 Mark has , so to speak , his own “ theory of parables , ” which he here places on the lips of Jesus . In his view , parables were and remained enigmatic : their meaning was clear only to the disciples , those who really “ heard ” Jesus ( “ hear ” is the key word in these texts ) and believed in him . See notes on Mt 13:1-51 ; 13:3a ; 13:3b-9 ; 13:10-15 . - Mark 4:11 Mysteries : see note on Mt 13:11 . - Mark 4:12 The citation is from Isa 6:9-10 . Acts ( 28:26-27 ) and Romans ( 11:7-16 , 29-32 ) cite the same passage of Isaiah to show that the rejection by the people of the Covenant had been foretold and that God ’ s plan can not be checkmated by the defection of human beings . It is not that God wants them to reject the word . They do that on their own because they do not want to receive God ’ s forgiveness . - Mark 4:13 See note on Mt 13:18-23 . - Mark 4:21 Just as a lamp is placed to provide light , not to hide it , so Jesus , the light of the world , is destined to be revealed . - Mark 4:24 As an example of the way in which the sayings of Jesus were handed on , we may observe that the parable about measure is applied here to the reception of the “ word , ” but is used in Matthew ( 7:2 ) and Luke ( 6:38 ) with reference to judgment of one ’ s brother or sister . - Mark 4:25 To the one who has , more will be given . . . : one of the meanings of this text is that those who appropriate the truth more will receive more truth in the future ; however , those who do not respond to what little truth they may know already will not profit even from that amount . - Mark 4:26 This parable , the only one peculiar to Mark , illustrates his idea of the power of the Gospel . The term harvest is an image of the judgment ( see Joel 4:13 ; Rev 14:15 ) . - Mark 4:30 See notes on Mt 13:31-32 and 13:32 . - Mark 4:33 These words mitigate and partly explain the warning in v.
NCB	Mark	5	5	Day and night among the tombs and on the mountains , he would howl and gash himself with stones .
NCB	Mark	5	1	They reached the region of the Gerasenes [ b ] on the other side of the lake .
NCB	Mark	5	2	No sooner had he stepped out of the boat than a man with an unclean spirit came up to him from the tombs . [ c ]
NCB	Mark	5	3	The man had been living in the tombs , and no one could restrain him any longer , not even with chains .
NCB	Mark	5	4	For he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains , but he had snapped the chains and smashed the shackles to pieces , and no one had sufficient strength to subdue him .
NCB	Mark	5	6	When the man caught sight of Jesus from a distance , he ran up and prostrated himself before him ,
NCB	Mark	5	7	as he shouted at the top of his voice , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I implore you in God ’ s name : do not torment me ! ”
NCB	Mark	5	8	For Jesus had said to him , “ Unclean spirit , come out of the man ! ”
NCB	Mark	5	9	Then he asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He replied , “ My name is Legion , for there are many of us. ” [ d ]
NCB	Mark	5	10	And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country .
NCB	Mark	5	11	Now on the mountainside a great herd of pigs was feeding .
NCB	Mark	5	12	And they pleaded with him , “ Send us into the pigs . Let us enter them. ”
NCB	Mark	5	13	He allowed this . With that , the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs , and the herd , numbering about two thousand , charged down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned in the waters .
NCB	Mark	5	14	Those tending the pigs ran off and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside . As a result , people came out to see what had happened .
NCB	Mark	5	15	When they came near Jesus , they saw the man who had been possessed by Legion sitting there fully clothed and in his right mind , and they were frightened .
NCB	Mark	5	16	Those who had been eyewitnesses to the incident confirmed what had happened to the demoniac and what had happened to the pigs .
NCB	Mark	5	17	Then they began to implore Jesus to leave their region .
NCB	Mark	5	18	As Jesus was getting into the boat , the man who had been possessed with demons pleaded to be allowed to go with him .
NCB	Mark	5	19	However , Jesus would not permit him to do so , and instead told him , “ Go home to your own people and tell them what the Lord has done for you , and how he has had mercy on you. ”
NCB	Mark	5	20	The man then departed and began to make known throughout the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him . And everyone was amazed . [ e ]
NCB	Mark	5	21	Jesus Heals a Woman and Raises a Child . [ f ] When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side , a large crowd gathered around him , and he stayed by the lake .
NCB	Mark	5	22	Then one of the leaders of the synagogue , [ g ] named Jairus , came forward , and when he saw Jesus he threw himself down at his feet
NCB	Mark	5	23	and pleaded with him , saying , “ My little daughter is at the point of death . I beg you to come and lay your hands on her so that she may recover and live. ”
NCB	Mark	5	24	Jesus went with him , and a large number accompanied him and crowded around him .
NCB	Mark	5	25	There was a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years .
NCB	Mark	5	26	In spite of long and painful treatment at the hands of many doctors , her condition not only had failed to improve but had actually become worse , and she had spent everything she had .
NCB	Mark	5	27	Having heard about Jesus , she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak ,
NCB	Mark	5	28	for she thought , “ If I simply touch his clothing , I shall be made well. ”
NCB	Mark	5	29	And immediately her bleeding dried up , and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
NCB	Mark	5	30	Instantly aware that power had gone forth from him , Jesus turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who touched my clothing ? ”
NCB	Mark	5	31	His disciples said in reply , “ You see this vast throng pressing upon you . How can you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
NCB	Mark	5	32	However , he continued to look around to determine who had done it .
NCB	Mark	5	33	Then the woman , knowing what had happened to her , approached in fear and trembling . She knelt before him and revealed to him the whole truth .
NCB	Mark	5	34	He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace and be freed from your affliction. ”
NCB	Mark	5	35	While he was still speaking , some people from the house of the synagogue leader arrived and said , “ Your daughter has died . Why bother the Teacher any further ? ”
NCB	Mark	5	36	Jesus heard the message they had delivered , but he said to the leader of the synagogue , “ Do not be afraid . Just have faith. ”
NCB	Mark	5	37	He allowed no one to accompany him except Peter , James , and John , [ h ] the brother of James .
NCB	Mark	5	38	When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader , he observed a great deal of commotion , with people weeping and wailing loudly .
NCB	Mark	5	39	When he entered , he said to them , “ Why this commotion and weeping ? The child is not dead ; she is asleep. ”
NCB	Mark	5	40	In response , they laughed at him . After sending them all outside , he took with him the child ’ s father and mother and his own companions and entered the room where the child was .
NCB	Mark	5	41	He took the child by the hand and said to her , “ Talitha koum ! ” which means : “ Little girl , I say to you , arise ! ”
NCB	Mark	5	42	And immediately the girl , a child of twelve , got up and began to walk around . On witnessing this , they were all overcome with amazement ,
NCB	Mark	5	43	but he gave them strict instructions that no one should be told anything about this . Then he told them to give her something to eat . Footnotes - Mark 5:1 The scene shifts to the Decapolis , a group of ten more or less autonomous cities east of the Jordan ; it is as if in a pagan land the forces of evil could enslave and destroy human beings . The demons are condemned to take refuge in the pigs , impure animals par excellence in Jewish eyes . See also note on Mt 8:28-34 . - Mark 5:1 The region of the Gerasenes : the area was southeast of Lake Tiberias . - Mark 5:2 Caves were used for tombs . - Mark 5:9 My name is Legion . . . there are many of us : a Roman legion was made up of
NCB	Mark	5	6000	men . The word “ legion ” gives the idea that the man was possessed by many demons and also provides an inkling of the numerous powers opposed to Jesus , who incorporates the divine power . - Mark 5:20 See note on Mt 4:25 . - Mark 5:21 A woman , who according to the ideas of the time was unclean and would contaminate by her touch , touches Jesus in a hidden gesture of hope ; he frees her from her disease with kind words . When Jesus restores the girl to life , he does it privately , because he does not want the Messiah to be thought of as a magician ; only three witnesses are there , those present at the transfiguration ( Mk 9:2 ) and the agony ( Mk 14:33 ) . These men would bear witness to the mystery of Jesus who dies and rises in order to save humanity from evil and death , and thus to Jesus as the authentic Messiah . See note on Mt 9:18-26 . - Mark 5:22 Leaders of the synagogue : laymen who held administrative responsibilities such as taking care of the building and supervising the worship . Most synagogues had only one ruler , but there were exceptions ( see Acts 13:15 ) . There were also cases of honorary leaders . - Mark 5:37 Peter , James , and John : while Matthew focuses his attention mainly on Peter , Mark stresses this privileged group of three disciples . They will be witnesses of the raising of Jairus ’ s daughter ( Mk 5:37-43 ) , the transfiguration of Jesus ( Mk 9:2-13 ) , and the agony in the garden ( Mk 14:32-42 ) . Obviously Mark depends on the preaching of Peter , yet Peter rarely emphasized his privilege .
NCB	Mark	6	6	He was amazed at their lack of faith . Who Is Jesus ? [ c ] Jesus Sends Out the Twelve on Mission . [ d ] Jesus traveled through the villages teaching .
NCB	Mark	6	1	Departing from that district , Jesus went to his hometown accompanied by his disciples .
NCB	Mark	6	2	On the Sabbath , he began to teach in the synagogue , and many of those who heard him asked in amazement , “ Where did this man get all this ? What is this wisdom that he has been granted ? What mighty deeds he performs !
NCB	Mark	6	3	Is this not the carpenter , the son of Mary , and the brother [ b ] of James and Joses and Judas and Simon ? Are not his sisters here with us ? ” And so they took offense at him .
NCB	Mark	6	4	Then Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is always treated with honor except in his hometown , and among relatives , and in his own house. ”
NCB	Mark	6	5	And he was unable to perform any mighty works there , aside from curing a few sick people by laying his hands on them .
NCB	Mark	6	7	Calling the Twelve together , he began to send them out two by two , with authority over unclean spirits .
NCB	Mark	6	8	He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a walking staff—no bread , no sack , no money in their purses .
NCB	Mark	6	9	They were to wear sandals but not to take along a second tunic .
NCB	Mark	6	10	,
NCB	Mark	6	11	And if any will not welcome you and refuse to listen to you , leave them immediately and shake off the dust that is on your feet in testimony against them. ”
NCB	Mark	6	12	Then they set off and preached the need for repentance .
NCB	Mark	6	13	) . Hence , the evangelist is alluding to Jesus as the Son of God . - Mark 6:53 The verses describe the responses of Jesus to the crowd ’ s interest in him ; they believe in his power to alleviate their sufferings .
NCB	Mark	6	14	; 43:1-3 ,
NCB	Mark	6	15	But others said , “ He is Elijah , ” while still others proclaimed , “ He is a prophet , like one of the prophets of old. ”
NCB	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard of it , he said , “ John , whom I beheaded , has been raised from the dead. ”
NCB	Mark	6	17	The Death of John the Baptist . [ g ] It was this same Herod who had ordered John to be arrested and put in chains in prison on account of Herodias , his brother Philip ’ s wife , because Herod had married her .
NCB	Mark	6	18	For John had told Herod , “ It is unlawful for you to have your brother ’ s wife. ”
NCB	Mark	6	19	As for Herodias , she was filled with resentment against John and wanted to have him killed , but she was unable to do so ,
NCB	Mark	6	20	because Herod was afraid of John , knowing him to be a holy and righteous man . Therefore , he protected him from harm . When he heard John speak , he was greatly perplexed by his words , but even so he liked to listen to him .
NCB	Mark	6	21	Her opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his court officials and military officers and the leaders of Galilee .
NCB	Mark	6	22	When the daughter of Herodias came in , she performed a dance that delighted Herod and his guests . The king said to the girl , “ Ask me for whatever you wish , and I will give it to you. ”
NCB	Mark	6	23	And he solemnly swore to her , “ Whatever you ask I will give you , even half of my kingdom. ”
NCB	Mark	6	24	The girl went out and said to her mother , “ What shall I ask for ? ” She replied , “ The head of John the Baptist. ”
NCB	Mark	6	25	The girl then hurried back to the king and made her request , “ I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ”
NCB	Mark	6	26	The king was greatly distressed , but because of the oath he had sworn and the presence of the guests , he was unwilling to break his word to her .
NCB	Mark	6	27	Therefore , he immediately ordered an executioner to bring him John ’ s head . The man went off and beheaded him in the prison .
NCB	Mark	6	28	Then he brought in the head on a platter and gave it to the girl , and the girl in turn gave it to her mother .
NCB	Mark	6	29	When John ’ s disciples heard about this , they came and removed his body and laid it in a tomb .
NCB	Mark	6	30	The Return of the Twelve . The apostles [ h ] returned to Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and taught .
NCB	Mark	6	31	He said to them , “ Come away with me , by yourselves , to a deserted place and rest for a while. ” For people continued to come and go in great numbers , and they had no time even to eat .
NCB	Mark	6	32	And so they went off by themselves in a boat to a deserted place .
NCB	Mark	6	33	Now many people saw them departing and recognized them , and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them .
NCB	Mark	6	34	As Jesus went ashore and beheld the vast crowd , he had compassion on them , for they were like sheep without a shepherd ; and he began to teach them many things .
NCB	Mark	6	35	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand Men . [ i ] When it began to be late in the day , his disciples came up to him and said , “ This is a deserted place , and it is getting very late .
NCB	Mark	6	36	Send the people away now so that they can go to the farms and villages in the area and buy something for themselves to eat. ”
NCB	Mark	6	37	He replied , “ Give them something to eat yourselves. ” They said to him , “ Are we to go and spend two hundred denarii [ j ] on bread for them to eat ? ”
NCB	Mark	6	38	He asked , “ How many loaves do you have ? Go and see. ” When they found out , they reported : “ Five loaves , and two fish. ”
NCB	Mark	6	39	Then he ordered them to have all the people sit down on the green grass in groups .
NCB	Mark	6	40	They sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties .
NCB	Mark	6	41	Taking the five loaves and the two fish , he looked up to heaven , blessed and broke the loaves , and gave them to the disciples to distribute among the people . He also divided the two fish among them .
NCB	Mark	6	42	They all ate and were satisfied .
NCB	Mark	6	43	Then they gathered up the fragments of the bread and fish—twelve full baskets . [ k ]
NCB	Mark	6	44	Those who had eaten the loaves numbered five thousand men .
NCB	Mark	6	45	Jesus Walks on the Water . [ l ] Immediately afterward , Jesus instructed his disciples to get into the boat and to go on ahead to Bethsaida on the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowd .
NCB	Mark	6	46	And when he had taken leave of them , he went up on the mountain to pray .
NCB	Mark	6	47	When evening came , the boat was far out on the water while he was alone on the shore .
NCB	Mark	6	48	He could see that the disciples were having difficulty in rowing the boat in the face of a headwind . Around the fourth watch of the night he came toward them , walking on the water . He was going to pass by them ,
NCB	Mark	6	49	but when the disciples saw him walking on the water they thought it was a ghost and they cried out ,
NCB	Mark	6	50	for they all had seen him and were terrified . But immediately he spoke to them , saying , “ Have courage ! It is I ! [ m ] Do not be afraid ! ”
NCB	Mark	6	51	Then he got into the boat with them , and the wind died down . They were utterly astounded ,
NCB	Mark	6	52	for they had not understood about the loaves . Their minds were closed .
NCB	Mark	6	53	Jesus Heals the Sick at Gennesaret . [ n ] After they had completed the crossing , they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat .
NCB	Mark	6	54	When they disembarked , the people recognized Jesus immediately .
NCB	Mark	6	55	They rushed throughout the entire countryside , and began to bring the sick to him on pallets wherever they heard he was .
NCB	Mark	6	56	Everywhere he went , whether to village or town or countryside , they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak . And all who touched it were completely healed . Footnotes - Mark 6:1 This story of a breach completes the second section of the first part . See note on Mt 13:53-58 . - Mark 6:3 Brother : see note on Mt 12:46 . - Mark 6:6 The very term “ Messiah ” is charged with too many facile hopes and misunderstandings , and Jesus avoids using it . If he reveals himself , it is through words and actions in the midst of events and encounters . The tragic end of John the Baptist prefigures his own destiny . Jesus bears witness to the goodness of God , shepherd of his people , and nourishes human beings with his word and his bread . His relationship with the disciples becomes closer and closer . Despite their failure to attain a full understanding of who he is , they are given the grace to recognize him as the Messiah . - Mark 6:6 Jesus impresses on the disciples that the preaching of the Gospel demands a genuine and unconditional detachment from earthly things . - Mark 6:13 At the time of Jesus , oil was frequently used to heal sickness . The anointing by the apostles set forth the healing power conferred on them by Jesus and prefigured the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick . - Mark 6:14 Jesus ’ name is known even in the palace of the tetrarch of Galilee : Antipas , a son of Herod the Great ; out of habit , the people continue to call this Herod “ king. ” - Mark 6:17 See note on Mt 14:1-12 . - Mark 6:30 Apostles : this word occurs in Mark only here ; it is also found in some manuscripts in Mk 3:14 . The apostles were authorized representatives of Jesus , and in this sense it is used in the New Testament of the Twelve ( Mk 3:14 ) and also of Paul ( Rom 1:1 ) . In a broader sense it is applied to a larger group including Barnabas ( Acts 14:14 ) , James , “ brother of the Lord ” ( Gal 1:19 ) , and possibly Andronicus and Junia ( Rom 16:7 ) . See also note on Mk 3:13-19 . - Mark 6:35 See notes on Mt 14:13-21 ; 14:19 ; and 14:21 . - Mark 6:37 Two hundred denarii : two hundred days ’ wages , for a day ’ s wage was one denarius ( see Mt 20:2 ) . - Mark 6:43 The Jews regarded bread as a gift of God . Accordingly , the scraps that fell during a meal were to be picked up and placed in small wicker baskets that people carried about . The disciples each filled a basket . - Mark 6:45 See notes on Mt 14:22-33 and 14:25 . - Mark 6:50 It is I : literally , “ I am , ” the formula that reveals the name of the Lord in the Old Testament ( see Ex 3:14 ; Isa 41:4 ,
NCB	Mark	7	7	in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. ’
NCB	Mark	7	1	Tim 4:3-4 ; Tit 1:15 ) . See also note on Mt 15:10-20 . - Mark 7:16 This verse is lacking in some of the most ancient manuscripts ; it was probably added here from Mk 4:9 or 4:23 . - Mark 7:24 See notes on Mt 15:21-28 and 15:21-22 . - Mark 7:31 The miracle of the deaf mute is omitted by the other evangelists . This man may also have been a pagan , for the population of the Decapolis was mostly pagan . The various gestures that Jesus performs on the man had the sole purpose of strengthening his faith . Mark might have recounted them in detail to foreshadow the future Christian Sacraments .
NCB	Mark	7	2	they noted that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands , that is , without washing them .
NCB	Mark	7	3	) are not found in Scripture and are not binding . - Mark 7:11 Corban : an Aramaic word meaning “ offered to God. ” - Mark 7:14 Jesus settles the question of clean and unclean foods that was erecting a barrier between Jews and pagans and was troubling Jews who had converted to Christianity ( see Acts 10:11 ,
NCB	Mark	7	4	And on coming from the marketplace they do not eat without first washing . In addition , there are many other traditions that they observe , such as the washing of cups and jugs and bronze kettles and tables . [ b ]
NCB	Mark	7	5	Therefore , the Pharisees and the scribes asked him , “ Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders but eat with unclean hands ? ”
NCB	Mark	7	6	He answered , “ How rightly Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites , as it is written : ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me ;
NCB	Mark	7	8	You thrust aside the commandment of God in order to preserve the traditions of men. ” [ c ]
NCB	Mark	7	9	Then he said to them , “ How cleverly you have set aside the commandment of God to preserve your own tradition !
NCB	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ Whoever curses father or mother will be put to death. ’
NCB	Mark	7	11	But you say , ‘ If anyone tells his father or mother : “ Anything I might have used for your support is Corban ” ’ [ d ] ( that is , dedicated to God ) ,
NCB	Mark	7	12	then he is forbidden by you from that very moment to do anything for his father or mother .
NCB	Mark	7	13	You nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition that you have handed down . And you do many other things just like that. ”
NCB	Mark	7	14	Clean and Unclean . [ e ] Then he called the people to him and said to them : “ Listen to me , all of you , and understand .
NCB	Mark	7	15	; Rom 14:14-23 ;
NCB	Mark	7	16	If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear ! ] ” [ f ]
NCB	Mark	7	17	When he had gone into the house , away from the crowds , his disciples questioned him about the parable .
NCB	Mark	7	18	He said to them , “ Then are you also without understanding ? Do you not realize that whatever goes into a person from outside can not defile him ,
NCB	Mark	7	19	since it enters not into the heart but into the stomach and is discharged into the sewer ? ” Thus , he pronounced all foods clean .
NCB	Mark	7	20	Then he went on , “ It is what comes out of a person that defiles .
NCB	Mark	7	21	For from within , from the human heart , come evil thoughts , unchastity , theft , murder ,
NCB	Mark	7	22	adultery , avarice , malice , deceit , indecency , envy , slander , arrogance , and folly .
NCB	Mark	7	23	All these evils come from within , and they defile a person. ”
NCB	Mark	7	24	The Faith of a Gentile Woman . [ g ] He moved on from that place to the region of Tyre . He went into a house and did not want anyone to know he was there , but he was not able to avoid being recognized .
NCB	Mark	7	25	Almost immediately , a woman whose daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him and hastened to fall down at his feet .
NCB	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Gentile of Syrophoenician origin , and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter .
NCB	Mark	7	27	Jesus said to her , “ Let the children be fed first . For it is not right to take the children ’ s bread and throw it to the dogs. ”
NCB	Mark	7	28	She replied , “ Yes , Lord ; but even the dogs under the table eat the scraps from the children. ”
NCB	Mark	7	29	Then Jesus said to her , “ For saying this , you may go . The demon has gone out of your daughter. ”
NCB	Mark	7	30	And when she returned home , she found the child lying in bed and the demon gone .
NCB	Mark	7	31	Jesus Heals a Deaf Man . [ h ] Returning from the region of Tyre , Jesus traveled by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , and into the region of the Decapolis .
NCB	Mark	7	32	Thereupon people brought to him a deaf man who had a speech impediment and begged him to lay his hand on him .
NCB	Mark	7	33	He took him aside , away from the crowd , and put his fingers into the man ’ s ears and , spitting , touched his tongue .
NCB	Mark	7	34	Then , looking up to heaven , he sighed and said to him , “ Ephphatha ! ” which means , “ Be opened ! ”
NCB	Mark	7	35	At once , the man ’ s ears were opened , his tongue was loosened , and he spoke properly .
NCB	Mark	7	36	Then he ordered them not to tell anyone , but the more he ordered them not to do so , the more widely they proclaimed it .
NCB	Mark	7	37	Their astonishment was beyond measure . “ He has done all things well , ” they said . “ He even makes the deaf able to hear and the mute able to speak. ” Footnotes - Mark 7:1 Jesus reproaches the teachers , who insist upon “ traditions ” that they themselves have sometimes invented , with a legalism that allows them to have a good conscience , even as they disregard the essential demands of the Law ( Ex 20:12 ; 21:17 ; Lev 20:9 ; Isa 29:13 ) . See also note on Mt 15:2ff . - Mark 7:4 Moses had prescribed a few ablutions for priests when they prepared for service at the altar ( Ex 30:17-21 ) . However , Rabbinic tradition had gone beyond the spirit of this prescription and arbitrarily extended it . Jesus condemns this Pharisaic formalism and censures his opponents who out of love for their traditions had nullified the more important commandments of the Law . His disciples—like the great majority of the common people—paid little attention to these prescriptions of the Pharisees . And tables : found only in some early manucripts . - Mark 7:8 The commandment of God . . . the traditions of men : Jesus makes a clear contrast between the two . The commandment of God is found in Scripture and is binding ; the traditions of men ( also known as the tradition of the elders : v.
NCB	Mark	8	8	They ate and were satisfied . Afterward , the disciples picked up the fragments left over—seven full baskets .
NCB	Mark	8	1	In those days , a great crowd had again assembled , and they had nothing to eat . Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them ,
NCB	Mark	8	2	“ I am moved with compassion for these people , because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat .
NCB	Mark	8	3	If I send them away hungry to their homes , they will collapse on the way—and some of them have come from far off. ”
NCB	Mark	8	4	His disciples replied , “ How can anyone find enough bread here in this deserted place to feed these men ? ”
NCB	Mark	8	5	He asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” They replied , “ Seven. ”
NCB	Mark	8	6	Jesus ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground . Then he took the seven loaves , and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute , and they distributed them to the people .
NCB	Mark	8	7	There were also a few small fish , and after blessing them he commanded that these too should be distributed .
NCB	Mark	8	9	The people there numbered about four thousand . And when he had sent them away ,
NCB	Mark	8	10	he immediately got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha . [ b ]
NCB	Mark	8	11	The Demand for a Sign . [ c ] The Pharisees came forward and began to argue with him . To put him to the test they asked him to show them a sign from heaven .
NCB	Mark	8	12	Sighing from the depths of his spirit , he said , “ Why does this generation ask for a sign ? Amen , I say to you , no sign will be given to this generation. ”
NCB	Mark	8	13	Then he left them , got into the boat again , and sailed across to the other side .
NCB	Mark	8	14	The Yeast of the Pharisees . [ d ] They had forgotten to bring any bread with them , and they had only one loaf in the boat .
NCB	Mark	8	15	Jesus then gave them this warning , “ Be careful , and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod. ”
NCB	Mark	8	16	They talked about this to one another and concluded : “ It is because we have no bread. ”
NCB	Mark	8	17	Becoming aware of what they were discussing , he said to them , “ Why are you talking about having no bread ? Do you still not understand or comprehend ? Are your hearts hardened ?
NCB	Mark	8	18	Do you have eyes and fail to see ? Do you have ears and fail to hear ? “ And do you not remember ?
NCB	Mark	8	19	When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many baskets filled with fragments did you collect ? ” They answered , “ Twelve. ”
NCB	Mark	8	20	“ When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many baskets filled with fragments did you collect ? ” They answered , “ Seven. ”
NCB	Mark	8	21	He said to them , “ Do you still not understand ? ”
NCB	Mark	8	22	Jesus Heals a Blind Man . [ e ] They arrived at Bethsaida , and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged that he touch him .
NCB	Mark	8	23	He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village . Then , putting saliva on his eyes , he laid his hands on him and asked , “ Can you see anything ? ”
NCB	Mark	8	24	Looking up , the man responded , “ I can see people , but they look like trees walking around. ”
NCB	Mark	8	25	Jesus placed his hands on the man ’ s eyes again , and the man looked around intently . His sight was restored , and he was able to see everything clearly .
NCB	Mark	8	26	Then he sent him away to his home , saying , “ Do not even go into the village. ”
NCB	Mark	8	27	Peter ’ s Confession That Jesus Is the Messiah . [ f ] Then Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages of Caesarea Philippi . Along the way he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
NCB	Mark	8	28	They responded , “ [ Some say ] John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , one of the prophets. ”
NCB	Mark	8	29	“ But you , ” he asked , “ who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered him , “ You are the Christ. ”
NCB	Mark	8	30	Then he gave them strict orders not to tell anyone about him . The Mystery of Jesus Is Revealed [ g ] The Way of the Son of Man [ h ]
NCB	Mark	8	31	Jesus Predicts His Passion . [ i ] After that , he began to teach them that the Son of Man must endure great suffering , be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , [ j ] and be put to death , and rise again after three days .
NCB	Mark	8	32	He told them these facts in plain words . Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
NCB	Mark	8	33	At this , Jesus turned and , looking at his disciples , rebuked Peter and said , “ Get behind me , Satan ! You are thinking not as God does , but as men do. ”
NCB	Mark	8	34	The Conditions of Discipleship . [ k ] He then called the people and his disciples to him and said to them , “ Anyone who wishes to follow me must deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me .
NCB	Mark	8	35	[ l ] For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake and the sake of the gospel will save it .
NCB	Mark	8	36	What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his very life ?
NCB	Mark	8	37	Indeed , what can he give in exchange for his life ?
NCB	Mark	8	38	“ If anyone in this adulterous and sinful generation is ashamed of me and of my words , the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. ” Footnotes - Mark 8:1 See note on Mt 15:29-39 . - Mark 8:10 Dalmanutha : location unknown . - Mark 8:11 See note on Mt 16:1-4 . - Mark 8:14 See note on Mt 16:5-12 . - Mark 8:22 Jesus ’ actions and the healing of the blind man seem to have the same purpose as his actions and the healing of the deaf mute ( see Mk 7:3-37 ) . Some scholars regard both healings as a means of expressing the gradual enlightenment of the disciples about Jesus ’ Messiahship . - Mark 8:27 Many scholars believe that Peter ’ s confession of Jesus ’ Messiahship constitutes the central point of this Gospel . It is the decisive doctrinal turning point in which we have the end of the Messianic Secret . Up to this point Jesus demanded the greatest secrecy about the mystery of his person . Henceforth , Jesus utters repeated exhortations concerning the following of the Messiah . The apostles had recognized the Messiah through Peter ’ s confession in spite of the humble and insignificant appearances of their Master ’ s public activity . Now they must cling with faith to the suffering Messiah and accept the scandal of the cross . - Mark 8:31 Where are we to find the revelation that God wants to communicate to humanity ? We must look to the cross , understand and share the condition of Jesus , and answer the call that he gives us to follow him . It is a suffering and humiliated Christ who saves the human race . Of this Mark is certain . - Mark 8:31 It is with full awareness and deliberation that Jesus sets out toward the fulfillment of his mission . He speaks on three occasions of the way of suffering and humiliation that he sees opening before him , and on all three occasions he encounters closed minds . - Mark 8:31 See notes on Mt 16:21 and 16:22-23 . - Mark 8:31 The elders , the chief priests , and the scribes : the members of the Sanhedrin . - Mark 8:34 See note on Mt 16:25 . - Mark 8:35 The Greek word for “ life ” can also mean “ soul. ” “ Life ” is used in a double sense—earthly life and eternal life .
NCB	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus ordered them to tell no one what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
NCB	Mark	9	1	Cor 3:13-15 ) . Salt , a symbol of fidelity , was sprinkled on sacrificial victims so that they might be pleasing to God ( Lev 2:13 ) . When the testing is endured with fidelity , it makes the believer acceptable to God .
NCB	Mark	9	2	Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves . And in their presence he was transfigured ;
NCB	Mark	9	3	his clothes became dazzling white—whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them .
NCB	Mark	9	4	And Elijah with Moses appeared , conversing with Jesus .
NCB	Mark	9	5	Then Peter said to Jesus , “ Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . Let us make three tents—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NCB	Mark	9	6	He did not know what to say , for they were so frightened .
NCB	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud cast a shadow over them , and a voice came out of the cloud : “ This is my beloved Son . Listen to him. ”
NCB	Mark	9	8	Suddenly , when they looked around , they saw no one with them anymore , but only Jesus . Elijah Has Already Come . [ c ]
NCB	Mark	9	10	Therefore , they kept the matter to themselves , although they did argue about what rising from the dead could possibly mean .
NCB	Mark	9	11	And they asked him , “ Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NCB	Mark	9	12	He said to them , “ Elijah will indeed come first and restore all things . Yet how is it written about the Son of Man ? —that he must endure great suffering and be treated with contempt !
NCB	Mark	9	13	However , I tell you that Elijah has come , and they did to him whatever they pleased , as it is written about him. ”
NCB	Mark	9	14	Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by a Spirit . [ d ] When they returned to the disciples , they saw a large crowd surrounding them , and some scribes were engaged in an argument with them .
NCB	Mark	9	15	As soon as the people saw Jesus , they were overcome with awe and ran forward to greet him .
NCB	Mark	9	16	He asked them , “ What are you arguing about with them ? ”
NCB	Mark	9	17	A man in the crowd answered him , “ Teacher , I have brought you my son who is possessed by a spirit that makes him unable to speak .
NCB	Mark	9	18	Wherever it seizes him , it flings him to the ground , and he foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes rigid . I asked your disciples to drive it out , but they were unable to do so. ”
NCB	Mark	9	19	Jesus said to them in reply , “ O unbelieving generation , how much longer shall I remain with you ? How much longer must I put up with you ? Bring the boy to me. ”
NCB	Mark	9	20	When they brought the boy to him , the spirit saw him and immediately threw the child into convulsions . He fell to the ground and rolled around , foaming at the mouth .
NCB	Mark	9	21	Jesus asked the father , “ How long has the boy been in this condition ? ” “ From childhood , ” he replied .
NCB	Mark	9	22	“ It has often tried to kill him by throwing him into a fire or into water . If it is possible for you to do anything , have pity on us and help us. ”
NCB	Mark	9	23	Jesus answered , “ If it is possible ! All things are possible for one who has faith. ”
NCB	Mark	9	24	Immediately , the father of the child cried out , “ I do believe . Help my unbelief. ”
NCB	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering around them , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , “ Deaf and mute spirit , I command you : come out of him and never enter him again ! ”
NCB	Mark	9	26	Shrieking and throwing the boy into convulsions , it came out of him . He lay there like a corpse , so that many remarked , “ He is dead. ”
NCB	Mark	9	27	But Jesus , taking him by the hand , raised him , and he stood up .
NCB	Mark	9	28	When he went indoors , his disciples asked him privately , “ Why were we not able to cast it out ? ”
NCB	Mark	9	29	He answered , “ This kind can not be driven out except by prayer [ and by fasting ] . ” [ e ]
NCB	Mark	9	30	Jesus Predicts His Passion a Second Time . [ f ] They proceeded from there and began to journey through Galilee , but Jesus did not want anyone to know about it
NCB	Mark	9	31	because he was teaching his disciples . He told them , “ The Son of Man [ g ] will be handed over into the power of men . They will kill him , and three days after being killed he will rise. ”
NCB	Mark	9	32	But they did not understand what he was saying , and they were afraid to ask him about it .
NCB	Mark	9	33	The Greatest in the Kingdom . [ h ] They came to Capernaum , and once they were in the house he asked them , “ What were you arguing about during the journey ? ”
NCB	Mark	9	34	But they remained silent , for on the way they had been arguing about which one of them was the greatest .
NCB	Mark	9	35	Then he sat down , summoned the Twelve , and said to them , “ If anyone wishes to be first , he must become the last of all and the servant of all. ”
NCB	Mark	9	36	He then took a child , placed it in their midst , and put his arms around it as he said ,
NCB	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me ; and whoever receives me receives not me but the one who sent me. ”
NCB	Mark	9	38	Whoever Is Not against Us Is for Us . John said to him , “ Teacher , we observed someone expelling demons in your name , and we forbade him because he was not one of us. ” [ i ]
NCB	Mark	9	39	Jesus replied , “ Do not hinder him , for no one who performs a miracle in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me .
NCB	Mark	9	40	Whoever is not against us is for us .
NCB	Mark	9	41	Amen , I say to you , whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ will certainly not go unrewarded .
NCB	Mark	9	42	Woe to the World because of Scandals . [ j ] “ If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea .
NCB	Mark	9	43	“ If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . [ k ] It is preferable for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go into the unquenchable fire of Gehenna [
NCB	Mark	9	44	where the devouring worm never dies and the fire is never quenched ] [ l ]
NCB	Mark	9	45	And if your foot causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into Gehenna [
NCB	Mark	9	46	where the devouring worm never dies and the fire is never quenched ] .
NCB	Mark	9	47	And if your eye causes you to sin , tear it out . It is preferable for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into Gehenna ,
NCB	Mark	9	48	. Fire signifies the testing that precedes God ’ s judgment ( see
NCB	Mark	9	49	The Simile of Salt. “ For everyone will be salted with fire . [ m ]

He also implies that the initiative for the death of the Servant ( see Isa
NCB	Mark	9	53	) belongs to God . - Mark 9:31 Son of Man : see note on Mt 8:20 . - Mark 9:33 This incident and the sayings that follow it are most likely intended to be a commentary on the lack of understanding exhibited by the disciples . They are to serve the poor and lowly . Jesus used children as the symbol for the anawim , the poor in spirit , i.e. , the lowly in the Christian community . - Mark 9:38 Not one of us : though the man was not one of the Twelve , he was a believer in Jesus and acted in his name . Therefore , Jesus counsels the Twelve that they should not oppose him . - Mark 9:42 See note on Mt 18:5-11 . - Mark 9:43 Cut it off : Jesus is here using hyperbole , a figure of speech that exaggerates to make a point .

NCB	Mark	10	10	When they were again in the house , the disciples once more questioned Jesus about this .
NCB	Mark	10	1	After departing from there , Jesus came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan . [ b ] Again the crowds gathered around him , and , as was his custom , he began to teach them .
NCB	Mark	10	2	Some Pharisees came forward and in order to test him asked , “ Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife ? ”
NCB	Mark	10	3	He replied , “ What did Moses command you ? ”
NCB	Mark	10	4	They said , “ Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and dismiss her. ”
NCB	Mark	10	5	But Jesus said to them , “ It was because of the hardness of your hearts that he wrote this commandment for you .
NCB	Mark	10	6	But from the very beginning of creation , ‘ God made them male and female. ’
NCB	Mark	10	7	‘ That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife ,
NCB	Mark	10	8	and the two become one flesh. ’ And so they are no longer two but one flesh .
NCB	Mark	10	9	Therefore , what God has joined together , let no one separate. ”
NCB	Mark	10	11	He said to them , “ If a man divorces his wife and marries another , he commits adultery against her .
NCB	Mark	10	12	In the same way , if a wife divorces her husband and marries another , she commits adultery. ”
NCB	Mark	10	13	Jesus Receives Little Children . [ c ] People were bringing little children to him so that he might touch them , and the disciples sternly rebuked them .
NCB	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus became aware of this , he was indignant and said to them , “ Let the little children come to me ; do not hinder them . For it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs .
NCB	Mark	10	15	Amen , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it. ”
NCB	Mark	10	16	And he took them up into his arms , laid his hands on them , and blessed them .
NCB	Mark	10	17	The Rich Young Man . [ d ] As Jesus was starting out on a journey , a man came running up to him , knelt down , and asked him , “ Good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NCB	Mark	10	18	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good but God alone .
NCB	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not kill . Do not commit adultery . Do not steal . Do not bear false witness . Do not defraud . Honor your father and your mother. ’ ”
NCB	Mark	10	20	The man said to him , “ Teacher , I have observed all these since I was a child. ”
NCB	Mark	10	21	Looking at him , Jesus was moved with love and said , “ You need to do one further thing . Go and sell what you own , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ”
NCB	Mark	10	22	When he heard these words , the man ’ s face fell and he went away grieving , for he possessed great wealth .
NCB	Mark	10	23	Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ How difficult it will be for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God ! ”
NCB	Mark	10	24	The disciples were astounded on hearing his words , but Jesus insisted : “ Children , how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God !
NCB	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Mark	10	26	The disciples were even more greatly astonished , and they said to one another , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NCB	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For men it is impossible , but not for God . For God all things are possible. ”
NCB	Mark	10	28	Reward for Following Jesus . [ e ] Peter said to him , “ We have given up everything to follow you. ”
NCB	Mark	10	29	Jesus answered , “ Amen , I say to you , there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the gospel
NCB	Mark	10	30	who will not receive in this age a hundred times more houses , brothers and sisters , mothers and children , and lands—as well as persecutions—and in the age to come , eternal life .
NCB	Mark	10	31	But many who are first will be last , and the last will be first. ”
NCB	Mark	10	32	Jesus Predicts His Passion a Third Time . [ f ] As they were on the road going up to Jerusalem , Jesus walked ahead of them . The disciples were amazed , and those who followed were apprehensive . Once again , he took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what would happen to him .
NCB	Mark	10	33	“ Behold , we are now going up to Jerusalem , ” he said , “ and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death . Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles ,
NCB	Mark	10	34	who will mock him , and spit upon him , and scourge him , and put him to death . And after three days he will rise again. ”
NCB	Mark	10	35	The Son of Man Has Come To Serve . [ g ] Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came forward and said to him , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we request. ”
NCB	Mark	10	36	He asked them , “ What is it that you want me to do for you ? ”
NCB	Mark	10	37	They said to him , “ Allow us to sit , one at your right hand and the other at your left , in your glory. ”
NCB	Mark	10	38	Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I drink , [ h ] or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
NCB	Mark	10	39	They said to him , “ We can. ” Then Jesus said to them , “ The cup that I drink you shall indeed drink , and with the baptism with which I am baptized you shall be baptized .
NCB	Mark	10	40	But to sit at my right hand or at my left is not in my power to grant . Those places belong to those for whom they have been prepared. ”
NCB	Mark	10	41	When the other ten heard this , they began to be indignant at James and John .
NCB	Mark	10	42	Therefore , Jesus called them over and said , “ You know that those considered to be rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones make their authority over them felt .
NCB	Mark	10	43	But this must not be so with you . Instead , whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant ,
NCB	Mark	10	44	and whoever wishes to be first among you must be the servant of all .
NCB	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. ”
NCB	Mark	10	46	Jesus Heals a Blind Man . [ i ] Then they came to Jericho . And as Jesus , his disciples , and a huge crowd were leaving Jericho , a blind man , Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , [ j ] was sitting by the roadside asking for alms .
NCB	Mark	10	47	When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout , “ Jesus , Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
NCB	Mark	10	48	Many rebuked him and told him to be silent , but he only shouted all the louder , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
NCB	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him. ” So they called the blind man , saying to him , “ Take heart ! Stand up ! He is calling you ! ”
NCB	Mark	10	50	Casting aside his cloak , he jumped up and went to Jesus .
NCB	Mark	10	51	Then Jesus said to him , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man said to him , “ Rabbi , [ k ] let me receive my sight. ”
NCB	Mark	10	52	Jesus said to him , “ Go on your way ! Your faith has made you well. ” Immediately , he received his sight and followed him along the road . Footnotes - Mark 10:1 Divorce was practiced by permission of the Mosaic Law ( Deut 24:1 ) . But a permission supposes a weakness ; it does not represent the law that gives life . From the beginning , God willed the unity of the couple in marriage ( see Gen 1:27 and 2:24 ) . Jesus recalls this requirement and shows , too , that the Scriptures ought to be interpreted in light of the fundamental perspectives of God ’ s plan and not on the basis of the changeable desires and needs of human beings . - Mark 10:1 Region of Judea beyond the Jordan : Judea was the southern part of Palestine , which had formerly been the southern kingdom . Jesus went south from Capernaum over the mountains of Samaria into Judea and then east across the Jordan to Perea , the territory of Herod Antipas . - Mark 10:13 This episode is common to the Synoptics , but Mark alone recounts the human traits of the divine Master , such as his indignation at the disciples ’ hindering action and his affectionate attitude in embracing the children . - Mark 10:17 See note on Mt 19:16-26 . - Mark 10:28 See note on Mt 19:27-30 . - Mark 10:32 See note on Mt 20:17-19 . Gentiles , who will . . . put him to death : the predictions of the Passion in Mark ’ s Gospel do not mention the word “ crucified. ” However , crucifixion is implied by the fact that he was to be handed over to the Gentiles to be killed , since this was the customary Roman means of executing non-Romans . - Mark 10:35 What was Christ ’ s own understanding of his life , of the kingdom , of what it meant to be a disciple ? An answer is given in this decisive passage ( see vv . 42-45 ) . So important are these verses that Luke points up their essential context by placing them in the account of the Supper ( Lk 22:24-27 ) and John in the explanation of the washing of the feet ( Jn 13:12-17 ) . The kingdom of God has nothing to do with ambitions for political or social power ; true greatness is found not in prestige or rule but only in service . - Mark 10:38 Drink the cup that I drink : a Hebraism for sharing someone ’ s fate . In the Old Testament , the “ cup of wine ” was a metaphor for God ’ s wrath against sin and rebellion ( Ps 75:9 ; Isa 51:17-23 ; Jer 25:15-28 ; 49:12 ; 51:7 ) . Thus , the cup Jesus had to drink refers to the punishment of sins that he bore in place of all human beings ( see Mk 10:45 ; 14:36 ) . Baptism : an image of Jesus ’ suffering and death . - Mark 10:46 This healing is the last miracle of Jesus in Mark ’ s Gospel . - Mark 10:46 Son of Timaeus is the meaning of Bartimaeus in Aramaic . - Mark 10:51 Rabbi : means “ master ” ( see Jn 20:16 ; Mt 23:7 ) .
NCB	Mark	11	11	He entered Jerusalem and went into the temple , where he looked around at everything . Then , since the hour was already late , he went out to Bethany with the Twelve .
NCB	Mark	11	1	When they drew near Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany , near the Mount of Olives , he sent off two of his disciples ,
NCB	Mark	11	2	saying to them , “ Go into the village directly ahead of you , and as soon as you enter it you will find tied there a colt on which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
NCB	Mark	11	3	If anyone says to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ say : ‘ The Lord needs it and will send it back immediately. ’ ”
NCB	Mark	11	4	The two went off and found a colt tied beside a door outside on the street . As they were untying it ,
NCB	Mark	11	5	some of them said to them , “ What are you doing , untying that colt ? ”
NCB	Mark	11	6	They answered as Jesus had instructed them , and they allowed them to take it .
NCB	Mark	11	7	Then they brought the colt to Jesus and spread their cloaks on its back . And he sat on it .
NCB	Mark	11	8	Many people spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields .

See also note on Mt 21:1-11 . - Mark 11:9 Hosanna : an acclamation meaning “ Grant salvation ! ” The citation is from Ps 118:25 . - Mark 11:12 The Prophets used the image of a fig tree with respect to Israel ( see Jer 8:13 ; 29:17 ; Joel 1:7 ; Hos 9:10 ,
NCB	Mark	11	12	Jesus Curses a Sterile Fig Tree . [ d ] On the next day , as they were leaving Bethany , he felt hungry .
NCB	Mark	11	13	Noticing in the distance a fig tree in leaf , he went to see if he could find any fruit on it . When he reached it , he found nothing except leaves , since it was not the season for figs .
NCB	Mark	11	14	Then he said to it , “ May no one ever again eat fruit from your branches. ” And his disciples heard him say this .
NCB	Mark	11	15	Jesus Cleanses the Temple . [ e ] Then they came to Jerusalem . He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were engaged there in buying and selling . He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves .
NCB	Mark	11	16	) . Jesus ’ cursing of the fig tree is regarded as a parable in action representing a judgment on Israel ’ s barrenness and Jerusalem ’ s rejection of Jesus ’ teaching ( see Isa 34:4 ; Hos 2:14 ; Lk 13:6-9 ) . - Mark 11:15 During his trial Jesus will be accused of having tried to set up a new temple ( Mk 14:58 ; 15:29 ) . - Mark 11:17 The first part of the citation is from Isa 56:7 . Only Mark has reported to us the expression for all the nations . Thus , the gesture of Jesus takes on a Messianic meaning , alluding to the conversion of the Gentiles .

NCB	Mark	11	17	Then he taught them , saying : “ Is it not written : [ f ] ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ’ ? But you have made it a den of thieves. ”
NCB	Mark	11	18	When the chief priests and the scribes heard about this , they plotted to do away with him . For they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching .
NCB	Mark	11	19	And when evening came , they left the city .
NCB	Mark	11	20	The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree . [ g ] Early the next morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots .
NCB	Mark	11	21	Then Peter , recalling what had happened , said to Jesus : “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree that you cursed has withered away. ”
NCB	Mark	11	22	Jesus said to them , “ Have faith in God .
NCB	Mark	11	23	Amen , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen , it will be accomplished for him .
NCB	Mark	11	24	So I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
NCB	Mark	11	25	“ And whenever you stand in prayer , forgive whatever grievance you have against anybody , so that your Father in heaven may forgive your wrongs too . [
NCB	Mark	11	26	But if you do not forgive others , then your Father in heaven will not forgive you your transgressions . ] ” [ h ]
NCB	Mark	11	27	) as well as the Herodians and Pharisees ( Mk 12:13 ) and the Sadducees ( Mk 12:18 ) . They rejected the messengers sent by God—John the Baptist and Jesus—and so incurred the judgment alluded to in these verses and confirmed by the parable of the tenants ( Mk 12:1-12 ) .
NCB	Mark	11	28	and asked , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? Or who gave you the authority to do them ? ”
NCB	Mark	11	29	Jesus said to them , “ I will ask you one question . Give me an answer , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
NCB	Mark	11	30	Did John ’ s baptism originate from heaven or from men ? Tell me ! ”
NCB	Mark	11	31	They argued among themselves , “ If we say : ‘ From heaven , ’ he will say , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NCB	Mark	11	32	But how can we say , ‘ From men ’ ? ” —for they were afraid of the people , who all regarded John as a true prophet .
NCB	Mark	11	33	Therefore , they answered Jesus , “ We do not know. ” And Jesus said to them , “ Then neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” Footnotes - Mark 11:1 We are at Jerusalem , where the decisive action takes place . Jesus ’ confrontation with the established religion takes on an irremediable character . Mark groups together in three days the events that consummate the break and thus open the way of faith in Christ to the whole world . The time of Israel is ended . The presence of Jesus in the Holy City and in the temple is like a visit from God , a fulfillment , and a judgment . - Mark 11:1 The simplicity of the event and the modest mount ridden by Jesus ( see Zec 9:9 ) suggest that “ the coming kingdom ” ( v.
NCB	Mark	12	12	They wanted to arrest him because they realized that this parable was directed at them , but they were afraid of the crowd . Therefore , they left him and went away . Controversies [ b ]
NCB	Mark	12	1	Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables : “ A man planted a vineyard , put a fence around it , dug a pit for the winepress , and built a watchtower . Then he leased it to tenants and went off on a journey .
NCB	Mark	12	2	Sam 7:1-17 ) . Then , too , many psalms , including
NCB	Mark	12	3	But they seized the servant , beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
NCB	Mark	12	4	Again , he sent them another servant , but they beat him over the head and treated him shamefully .
NCB	Mark	12	5	Then he sent another , and that one they killed . He also sent many others , some of whom they beat , and others of whom they killed .
NCB	Mark	12	6	“ Finally , he had only one other to send—his beloved son . And so he sent him to them , thinking : ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NCB	Mark	12	7	But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours ! ’
NCB	Mark	12	8	And so they seized him , killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
NCB	Mark	12	9	“ What then will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come and put those tenants to death and give the vineyard to others .
NCB	Mark	12	10	Have you not read this Scripture : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ;
NCB	Mark	12	11	by the Lord this has been done , and it is wonderful in our eyes ’ ? ”
NCB	Mark	12	13	God or Caesar . [ c ] Then they sent some Pharisees and Herodians to trap him in what he said .
NCB	Mark	12	14	They came and said to him , “ Teacher , we know that you are truthful and are not concerned with anyone ’ s opinion no matter what his station in life . Rather , you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . Is it lawful or not for us to pay taxes to Caesar ? Should we pay them or not ? ”
NCB	Mark	12	15	He was aware of their hypocrisy and said to them , “ Why are you trying to trap me ? Bring me a denarius [ d ] and let me examine it. ”
NCB	Mark	12	16	When they brought one , he asked them , “ Whose image is this , and whose inscription ? ” They replied and said to him , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NCB	Mark	12	17	Jesus said to them , “ Give to Caesar what is due to Caesar , and to God what is due to God. ” His reply left them completely amazed at him .
NCB	Mark	12	18	Marriage and the Resurrection . [ e ] Then some Sadducees , who assert that there is no resurrection , approached him and posed this question ,
NCB	Mark	12	19	“ Teacher , Moses wrote down for us that if a man ’ s brother dies , leaving a wife but no child , the man shall take his brother ’ s wife and raise up children for his brother .
NCB	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brothers . The first brother took a wife and died , leaving no children .
NCB	Mark	12	21	; 10:12-13 ) . - Mark 12:35 The audience of Jesus is not specified here ; in Matthew he is speaking to the Pharisees , and in Luke to the scribes . - Mark 12:38 See notes on Mt 23:1-39 . - Mark 12:41 Jesus praises the offering of the poor widow because she gave more than all the others , although her gift was by far the smallest . She willingly gave out of her poverty ( all that she had to live on ) , while the others gave out of their abundance . Therefore , she provides a striking contrast to the pride and pretentiousness of the scribes , who were denounced in the previous section . - Mark 12:41 Treasury : a room with thirteen boxes , near the inner court of the temple , into which women could enter . - Mark 12:42 [ She ] put in two copper coins , that is , about a penny : literally , “ She put in two lepta , which is a fourth of an as. ” The fact that the poor widow gives two lepta shows that she could have given less . A lepton was the smallest Greek coin . For his readers ’ sake , Mark explains the amount in Roman terms ( “ fourth of an as , ” a penny ) .
NCB	Mark	12	22	None of the seven left any children . Last of all , the woman herself died .
NCB	Mark	12	23	Now at the resurrection , when they rise up , whose wife will she be , inasmuch as all seven had her ? ”
NCB	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Is not this the reason you are in error—namely , that you do not understand the Scriptures or the power of God ?
NCB	Mark	12	25	For when they rise from the dead , they will neither marry nor be given in marriage . They are like angels in heaven .
NCB	Mark	12	26	“ And in regard to the dead being raised , have you not read in the book of Moses , in the account about the bush , how God said to him : ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’
NCB	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead but of the living . You are very badly mistaken. ”
NCB	Mark	12	28	The Greatest Commandment . [ f ] Then one of the scribes who had listened to these discussions , and who had observed how well Jesus answered them , asked Jesus , “ Which is the first of all the commandments ? ” [ g ]
NCB	Mark	12	29	Jesus answered , “ The first is : ‘ Hear , O Israel : the Lord our God , the Lord is one !
NCB	Mark	12	30	You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength. ’
NCB	Mark	12	31	The second is this : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than these. ”
NCB	Mark	12	32	Then the scribe said to him , “ Well said , Teacher . You have truly said , ‘ He is one , and there is no other besides him. ’
NCB	Mark	12	33	And ‘ to love him with all your heart , and with all your understanding , and with all your strength , and to love your neighbor as yourself , ’ is worth more than any burnt offerings and sacrifices. ”
NCB	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw with what great understanding he had spoken , he said to him , “ You are not far from the kingdom of God. ” And after that no one dared to ask him any question .
NCB	Mark	12	35	Jesus Is Lord . [ h ] While Jesus was teaching in the temple area , he said , “ How can the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David ? [ i ]
NCB	Mark	12	36	David himself , inspired by the Holy Spirit , declared : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : “ Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet. ” ’
NCB	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him ‘ Lord ’ ; so how can he be his son ? ” And the large crowd listened to him with delight .
NCB	Mark	12	38	Denunciation of the Scribes . [ j ] In his teaching , he said , “ Beware of the scribes , who like to walk around in long robes , to be greeted respectfully in the marketplace ,
NCB	Mark	12	39	and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
NCB	Mark	12	40	They devour the houses of widows , while for the sake of appearance they recite lengthy prayers . They will receive the severest possible condemnation. ”
NCB	Mark	12	41	The Poor Widow ’ s Offering . [ k ] As Jesus was sitting opposite the treasury , [ l ] he watched the crowd putting money into the treasury . Many wealthy people put in large sums .
NCB	Mark	12	42	A poor widow also came and put in two copper coins , that is , about a penny . [ m ]
NCB	Mark	12	43	Then he called his disciples to him and said , “ Amen , I say to you , this poor widow has given more than all the other contributors to the treasury .
NCB	Mark	12	44	For the others have all contributed out of their abundance , but she out of her poverty has given everything she possessed , all that she had to live on. ” Footnotes - Mark 12:1 This parable was probably inspired by the peasant rebellions of the period . The parable would have an immediate impact on Jewish hearers , who were well acquainted with the “ Song of the Vineyard ” in Isa 5:1ff . See also note on Mt 21:33-46 . - Mark 12:13 The discussions continue . His opponents seek to have Jesus contradict himself so as to accede to their demands . But the questioners are caught in their own trap . And the masks of their false religion fall away . Who among us has not in some way acted like these scribes , Pharisees , and Sadducees when a decision of faith had to be made ! - Mark 12:13 See note on Mt 22:15-22 . - Mark 12:15 Denarius : the daily wage of a laborer . - Mark 12:18 To the conservative Sadducees , the resurrection of the dead—asserted toward the end of the Old Testament ( see Isa 26:19 ;
NCB	Mark	12	613	precepts listed by the teachers of the Law ; of these ,
NCB	Mark	12	365	( as many as the days of the year ) were negative , that is , contained prohibitions , and
NCB	Mark	12	248	( as many as the parts of the human body were thought to be ) were positive . - Mark 12:35 Every king was an “ Anointed ” ( Messiah or Christ ) , and Ps
NCB	Mark	12	110	, were attributed to David . Against this background Jesus asks a question based on this psalm , with the intention of carrying the thought a step further : he suggests that the Messiah ’ s origin is mysterious and that his kingship differs from that which his contemporaries await . The early Church will use the same psalm to show that the Resurrection of Jesus is his authentic enthronement as Messiah ( see Heb 1:3 ; 5:6 ; 6:20 ; 7:11 ,
NCB	Mark	13	13	You will be hated by all because of my name , but whoever stands firm to the end will be saved .
NCB	Mark	13	1	Mac 1:54 ; 6:7 , to the statue of the pagan emperor that was set up in the temple as a symbol of his divinity . Jesus is thus foretelling that this scandalous event will be repeated . - Mark 13:21 False messiahs who try to lead Christians astray can be resisted by clinging to revealed Truth taught by Christ ’ s Church . - Mark 13:24 The discourse now takes on clearly cosmic proportions . The upheaval in the elements is described in the customary expressions derived from apocalyptic language . However , the whole passage is centered upon the glorious appearance of the Messiah in his Second Coming . The emphasis is on the joy of the elect at the coming of the Son of Man rather than on their terror over the destruction of the world . See note on Mt 24:29-31 . - Mark 13:28 See note on Mt 23:32-35 . - Mark 13:30 It was typical of apocalypses that they announced events as if they had to do with the present generation . It was a way of involving the reader , of saying : “ This passage has to do with you. ” - Mark 13:32 See note on Mt 24:36-42 .
NCB	Mark	13	2	Jesus said to him , “ Do you see these great buildings ? Not a single stone will be left upon another ; every one will be thrown down. ” The End Has Not Yet Come . [ c ]
NCB	Mark	13	3	As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives directly across from the temple , Peter , [ d ] James , John , and Andrew questioned him when they were alone .
NCB	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , ” they said , “ when will this happen , and what will be the sign that all those things are about to be accomplished ? ”
NCB	Mark	13	5	Jesus began to say to them , “ Take care that no one deceives you .
NCB	Mark	13	6	Many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and they will lead many astray .
NCB	Mark	13	7	And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars , do not be alarmed , for those things are bound to happen , but the end is still to come .
NCB	Mark	13	8	For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom . There will be earthquakes in various places , and there will be famine . These are only the beginning of the labor pangs . The Coming Persecution . [ e ]
NCB	Mark	13	9	“ Be on your guard . For they will hand you over to courts and beat you in synagogues . You will stand before governors and kings because of me to testify before them .
NCB	Mark	13	10	But first the gospel must be preached to all nations .
NCB	Mark	13	11	“ When they arrest you and bring you to trial , do not be concerned beforehand about what you are to say . Simply say whatever is given to you when that time comes , for it will not be you who speak but the Holy Spirit .
NCB	Mark	13	12	“ Brother will betray brother to death , and a father his child . Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death .
NCB	Mark	13	14	The Great Trial. “ Therefore , when you see the abomination of desolation [ f ] standing where it does not belong ( let the reader understand ) , then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains ,
NCB	Mark	13	15	the one who is standing on the roof must not come down or go inside to take anything out of the house ,
NCB	Mark	13	16	and someone who is in the field must not turn back to retrieve his coat .
NCB	Mark	13	17	“ Woe to those who are pregnant and those who are nursing infants in those days .
NCB	Mark	13	18	Pray that all this may not occur in winter .
NCB	Mark	13	19	For in those days there will be such suffering as has not been since the beginning of the creation that God made until now and will never be again .
NCB	Mark	13	20	And if the Lord had not cut short those days , no one would be saved ; but for the sake of the elect whom he chose , he did cut short those days .
NCB	Mark	13	21	False Messiahs and False Prophets . [ g ] “ Therefore , if anyone says to you , ‘ Look , here is the Christ ! ’ or ‘ Look , there he is ! ’ do not believe it .
NCB	Mark	13	22	For false christs and false prophets will arise , and they will perform signs and wonders to lead astray God ’ s chosen ones , if that were possible .
NCB	Mark	13	23	Be on your guard ! I have forewarned you about everything .
NCB	Mark	13	24	The Coming of the Son of Man . [ h ] “ But in those days , following that distress , the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give forth its light ,
NCB	Mark	13	25	and the stars will be falling from the sky , and the heavenly powers will be shaken .
NCB	Mark	13	26	Then they will see ‘ the Son of Man coming in the clouds ’ with great power and glory .
NCB	Mark	13	27	And he will send forth his angels and gather his elect from the four winds , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens .
NCB	Mark	13	28	The Parable of the Fig Tree . [ i ] “ Learn this lesson from the fig tree . As soon as its twigs become tender and its leaves begin to sprout , you know that summer is near .
NCB	Mark	13	29	In the same way , when you see these things come to pass , know that he is near , at the very gates .
NCB	Mark	13	30	Amen , I say to you , this generation will not pass away before all these things have taken place . [ j ]
NCB	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
NCB	Mark	13	32	The Day and Hour Unknown . [ k ] “ But as for that day or that hour , no one knows , neither the angels in heaven , nor the Son , but only the Father .
NCB	Mark	13	33	Be on your guard and keep alert , because you do not know when the time will come .
NCB	Mark	13	34	“ It is like a man going on a journey . He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge , each with his own duties to perform , and he commands the doorkeeper to remain alert .
NCB	Mark	13	35	Therefore , keep watch , for you do not know when the master of the house will return , whether in the evening , or at midnight , or at cockcrow , or at dawn ,
NCB	Mark	13	36	lest he arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep .
NCB	Mark	13	37	What I say to you , I say to all : Keep awake ! ” Footnotes - Mark 13:1 For over two centuries the Jewish world had been familiar with these strange visions that were meant to explain in advance the events that would occur at the end of the world . The series of pictures describes the unfolding of a catastrophe . These literary pieces were known as “ apocalypses , ” that is , revelations ( see Isa 24–27 ; Ezek 34–36 ; Dan 7–12 ; Zec 14:1-20 ; etc. ) . In the present discourse , the longest in Mark ’ s Gospel , Jesus , too , speaks of the final destiny of the human race and borrows from the Jewish apocalypses the somewhat terrifying images that became part of the literary genre of apocalypse as found in the first three Gospels . The discourse is therefore known as “ the Synoptic apocalypse. ” And because it bids us reflect on the ultimate lot of humankind and the world , it is also known as the “ eschatological discourse , ” that is , a discourse about the end . - Mark 13:1 See note on Mt 24:1-2 . - Mark 13:3 See note on Mt 24:3-14 . - Mark 13:3 Peter : the disciples named were the first to be called ( see Mk 1:16-20 ) . In Mark , all of Jesus ’ teaching is given privately to these four disciples . - Mark 13:9 See note on Mt 24:15-22 . - Mark 13:14 The abomination of desolation refers , in Dan 11:31 ; 12:11 , and

NCB	Mark	14	3	) the breaking of the bread ; (
NCB	Mark	14	4	) the saying , “ This is my body ” ; (
NCB	Mark	14	5	) the taking of the cup ; and (
NCB	Mark	14	6	) the explanation of the relation of blood to the Covenant . Only Luke and Paul record the command to continue to celebrate the Supper , “ Do this in memory of me ” ( Lk 22:19 ;
NCB	Mark	14	7	The poor you will always have with you , and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish , but you will not always have me .
NCB	Mark	14	8	She has done what she could . She has anointed my body to prepare for my burial .

NCB	Mark	14	11	They were delighted when they heard his proposal , and they promised to give him money . Then he began to look for an opportunity to betray him .
NCB	Mark	14	12	The Preparations for the Passover . [ f ] On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread , when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb , the disciples said to Jesus , “ Where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the Passover ? ”
NCB	Mark	14	13	He sent forth two of his disciples , instructing them : “ Go into the city , and a man carrying a jug of water will meet you . Follow him !
NCB	Mark	14	15	Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready . Make the preparations for us there. ”

NCB	Mark	14	17	The Treachery of Judas Foretold . [ g ] Now when evening came , he arrived with the Twelve .
NCB	Mark	14	18	And as they reclined at table and were eating , Jesus said , “ Amen , I say to you , one of you will betray me , one who is eating with me. ”
NCB	Mark	14	19	On hearing this they began to be distressed and to say to him , one after another , “ Is it I ? ”
NCB	Mark	14	20	He said to them , “ It is one of the Twelve , one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me .

Many commentators have considered the young man to be Mark himself . - Mark 14:53 See note on Mt 26:57-68 . - Mark 14:55 Sanhedrin : the highest tribunal of the Jews . In New Testament times , it numbered
NCB	Mark	14	22	The Last Supper . [ h ] While they were eating he took bread , and after he had pronounced the blessing , he broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ Take it ; this is my body. ”
NCB	Mark	14	23	Then he took a cup , and after offering thanks he gave it to them . After they all drank from it ,
NCB	Mark	14	24	he said to them , “ This is my blood of the covenant , which will be shed on behalf of many .
NCB	Mark	14	25	Amen , I say to you , from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine until the day when I shall drink it anew in the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Mark	14	26	And after singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives .
NCB	Mark	14	27	Jesus Predicts Peter ’ s Denial . [ i ] Then Jesus said to them , “ You will all be scandalized , for it is written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be scattered. ’
NCB	Mark	14	28	But after I have been raised up , I shall go ahead of you to Galilee. ”
NCB	Mark	14	29	Peter said to him , “ Even if all the others will be scandalized , I will never be. ”
NCB	Mark	14	30	Jesus replied , “ Amen , I say to you , this very night , before the cock crows twice , you will deny me three times. ”
NCB	Mark	14	31	But Peter insisted , “ If I have to die with you , I will not deny you. ” And they all said the same thing .
NCB	Mark	14	32	The Agony in the Garden . [ j ] Then they went to a place that was called Gethsemane , and Jesus said to his disciples , “ Sit here while I pray. ”
NCB	Mark	14	33	He took with him Peter and James and John , and he began to suffer distress and anguish .
NCB	Mark	14	34	And he said to them , “ My soul is sorrowful , even to the point of death . Remain here and keep watch. ”
NCB	Mark	14	35	Moving on a little farther , he threw himself on the ground and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass him by ,
NCB	Mark	14	36	saying , “ Abba , Father , for you all things are possible . Take this cup from me . Yet not my will but yours be done. ”
NCB	Mark	14	37	Returning to the disciples , he found them sleeping . He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not keep watch for one hour ?
NCB	Mark	14	38	Stay awake and pray that you may not enter into temptation . The spirit is indeed willing but the flesh is weak. ”
NCB	Mark	14	39	Again , he went apart and prayed , saying the same words .
NCB	Mark	14	40	Then he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy , and they did not know what to say to him .
NCB	Mark	14	41	When he returned a third time , he said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? Enough ! The hour has come when the Son of Man is to be betrayed into the hands of sinners .
NCB	Mark	14	42	Get up ! Let us go ! Look , my betrayer is approaching. ”
NCB	Mark	14	43	Jesus Is Arrested . [ k ] At once , while he was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , arrived . With him there was a crowd of men , armed with swords and clubs , who had been sent by the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders .
NCB	Mark	14	44	Now his betrayer had agreed with them on a signal , saying , “ The one I shall kiss is the man . Arrest him , and lead him away under guard ! ”
NCB	Mark	14	45	And so , when he came , he proceeded directly to Jesus and said “ Rabbi ! ” and kissed him .
NCB	Mark	14	46	Then they seized him and placed him under arrest .
NCB	Mark	14	47	Meanwhile , one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priest , slicing off his ear .
NCB	Mark	14	48	Then Jesus said to them , “ Why are you coming forth with swords and clubs to arrest me , as though I were a bandit ?
NCB	Mark	14	49	Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching , and you did not arrest me . But in this way the Scriptures must be fulfilled. ”
NCB	Mark	14	50	Then everyone deserted him and fled .
NCB	Mark	14	51	[ l ] Among those who had followed Jesus was a young man wearing nothing but a linen cloth . They caught hold of him ,
NCB	Mark	14	52	but he slipped out of the linen cloth and ran off naked .
NCB	Mark	14	53	) . By this act he establishes the New Covenant ; it inaugurates a new relationship between God and humanity . - Mark 14:27 Despite the protestations of the Twelve that they will never abandon him , Jesus predicts that they will do so . But he also reassures them that after his Resurrection he will see them again in Galilee ( Mk 16:7 ; see Mt 26:32 ; 28:7 ,
NCB	Mark	14	54	Meanwhile , Peter had followed him at a distance , right into the courtyard of the high priest , and he was sitting there with the attendants , warming himself at the fire .
NCB	Mark	14	55	The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin [ n ] tried to elicit testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death , but they failed in their efforts .
NCB	Mark	14	56	Many witnesses offered perjured testimony against him , but their statements did not agree .
NCB	Mark	14	57	Then some stood up and gave this false witness against him :
NCB	Mark	14	58	“ We heard this man say , ‘ I will destroy this temple made with human hands , and in three days I will build another not made with hands. ’ ”
NCB	Mark	14	59	But even on this point their statements did not agree .
NCB	Mark	14	60	The high priest then rose among them and asked Jesus , “ Have you no reply to counter the testimony that these witnesses have given ? ”
NCB	Mark	14	61	[ o ] But he remained silent and offered no response . Again , the high priest questioned him , asking , “ Are you the Christ , the Son of the Blessed One ? ” [ p ]

NCB	Mark	14	63	Thereupon the high priest tore his garments and exclaimed , “ What need do we have of any further witnesses !
NCB	Mark	14	64	You have heard his blasphemy . What is your decision ? ” They all condemned him as guilty and deserving of death .
NCB	Mark	14	65	Some of them began to spit at him . They blindfolded him and struck him , taunting him as they said , “ Prophesy ! ” And the guards also slapped him .
NCB	Mark	14	66	Peter Denies Jesus . [ q ] While Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the high priest ’ s servant girls came by .
NCB	Mark	14	67	When she noticed Peter warming himself , she stared at him and said , “ You also were with Jesus , the man from Nazareth. ”
NCB	Mark	14	68	But he denied it , saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. ” Thereupon he went forth into the outer courtyard . Then the cock crowed . [ r ]
NCB	Mark	14	69	The servant girl saw him and again began to say to the bystanders : “ This man is one of them. ”

The Romans gave the tribunal much authority but not over capital punishment ( see Jn 18:31 ) . See also note on Mt 27:1-2 . - Mark 14:61 Just when he is being judged and abased , Jesus for the first time openly declares himself to be the Messiah , of royal descent and divine rank ( Ps 110:1 ; Dan 7:13 ) . The Jewish authorities are scandalized and condemn him . He then suffers the harsh lot of the Servant prophet . - Mark 14:61 Son of the Blessed One : in late Judaism people avoided uttering the name of God , as a sign of respect ; they preferred other expressions such as “ the Blessed One ” or “ the Power ” ( v.
NCB	Mark	14	72	At that very moment , a cock crowed for a second time , and Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him , “ Before the cock crows twice , you will deny me three times. ” And he broke down and wept . Footnotes - Mark 14:1 The Passion Narrative that makes the deepest impression is perhaps that of Mark ’ s Gospel . The writer does not aim to move the reader , still less to satisfy our curiosity with edifying anecdotes and points of information . The description is vivid , unpolished , clear-cut . Mark piles up concrete , detailed incidents in order to highlight the tragic character of the struggle that Jesus is carrying on alone , isolated in his silence and humiliation . It is precisely in his abasement that Jesus shows himself to be the Messiah , the King of Israel , Son of God , and Savior of the world . - Mark 14:1 We are at the religious high point of the year , the time of Passover , which is followed by the feast of Unleavened Bread , that is , an eight-day celebration during which only unleavened bread was eaten ( see Deut 16:1-8 ; Ex 12:5-20 ) . - Mark 14:3 At this period the burial of the dead was regarded as an indispensable work of charity and of greater merit than almsgiving . In the present circumstances of Jesus , the woman ’ s gesture of respect becomes a sign of his imminent death . In addition , in Mark ’ s Gospel the ointment is poured on the head of Jesus , suggesting an act of consecration . - Mark 14:5 Three hundred denarii : a year ’ s wages , a denarius being a day ’ s wages for a laborer . - Mark 14:10 See note on Mt 26:14-16 . - Mark 14:12 See notes on Mt 26:17-19 and 26:17 . - Mark 14:17 See note on Mt 26:20-25 . - Mark 14:22 Four accounts of the Lord ’ s Supper are found in the New Testament ( Mt 26:26-28 ; Mk 14:22-24 ; Lk 22:19-20 ; and
NCB	Mark	15	15	And so Pilate , anxious to appease the crowd , released Barabbas to them , and after ordering Jesus to be scourged , he handed him over to be crucified .
NCB	Mark	15	1	As soon as it was morning , the chief priests held a council with the elders and the scribes and the whole Sanhedrin . They bound Jesus and led him away , and handed him over to Pilate .

NCB	Mark	15	16	Jesus Is Crowned with Thorns . [ d ] Then the soldiers led Jesus away inside the palace , that is , the Praetorium , and they called the whole cohort together .
NCB	Mark	15	17	They dressed him in a purple robe and after twisting some thorns into a crown , they placed it on him .
NCB	Mark	15	18	Then they began to salute him with the words , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NCB	Mark	15	19	They repeatedly struck his head with a reed , spat upon him , and knelt down before him in homage .
NCB	Mark	15	20	And when they had finished mocking him , they stripped him of his purple robe and dressed him in his own clothes . Then they led him out to crucify him .
NCB	Mark	15	21	The Way of the Cross . [ e ] They compelled a passer-by who was returning from the country to carry his cross . The man was Simon of Cyrene , the father of Alexander and Rufus .
NCB	Mark	15	22	Jesus Is Crucified . They brought him to the place called Golgotha , which means the place of the skull .
NCB	Mark	15	23	They offered him some wine that had been mixed with myrrh , but he refused to take it .
NCB	Mark	15	24	Then they crucified him and divided his garments among them , casting lots for them to see what each should take . [ f ]
NCB	Mark	15	25	It was around nine o ’ clock in the morning when they crucified him . [ g ]
NCB	Mark	15	26	The inscription giving the charge against him read , “ The King of the Jews. ”
NCB	Mark	15	27	Along with him they crucified two thieves , one on his right and the other on his left . [
NCB	Mark	15	28	Thus was the Scripture fulfilled that says , “ And he was counted among the wicked. ” ] [ h ]

NCB	Mark	15	30	to
NCB	Mark	15	31	In much the same way , the chief priests and the scribes joined in the mockery among themselves , saying , “ He saved others , but he can not save himself .
NCB	Mark	15	32	Let the Christ , the King of Israel , come down from the cross right now so that we may see it and come to believe. ” Those who were crucified with him also taunted him .
NCB	Mark	15	33	Jesus Dies on the Cross . [ i ] Beginning at midday , there was darkness over the whole land until three in the afternoon .
NCB	Mark	15	34	At three o ’ clock , Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Eloi , Eloi , lema sabachthani ? ” which means , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
NCB	Mark	15	35	On hearing this , some of the bystanders said , “ Listen ! He is calling Elijah. ”
NCB	Mark	15	36	) . While God remains silent , the crucified Jesus cries out his aloneness in the words of Ps 22:2 , and breathes his last . But the work of Jesus has been completed . The end of Judaism has come , signified by the tearing of the curtain of the temple . Even now a pagan recognizes Jesus as the Son of God ; this is the first time in Mark ’ s Gospel that a human being is allowed to give him this title . - Mark 15:40 James the younger : this James is known as “ the Lesser , ” to distinguish him from the other apostle of the same name , the son of Zebedee and brother of John . From Mt 27:56 we know that Salome was the wife of Zebedee . - Mark 15:42 The burial of Jesus is arranged by Joseph of Arimathea , a respected member of the Sanhedrin who had not consented to the decision of that body concerning Jesus ( see Lk 23:51 ) . Matthew calls Joseph a “ rich man ” ( Mt 27:57 ) , which recalls the text of Isaiah ’ s prophecy about the Suffering Servant ( 53:9 : “ They assigned him a grave with the wicked and a burial place with evildoers ” ) .
NCB	Mark	15	37	Then Jesus cried out in a loud voice and breathed his last .
NCB	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two , from top to bottom .
NCB	Mark	15	39	When the centurion who was standing facing him saw how Jesus had breathed his last , he said , “ Truly this man was the Son of God. ”
NCB	Mark	15	40	pounds , to the place of crucifixion . Jesus starts out by doing the same ( see Jn 19:7 ) , but he is so weak as a result of his scourging and overall ill-treatment that the soldiers decide to have someone else take over that task . The man chosen is Simon , a man from Cyrene , an important city of Libya , North Africa , with a large Jewish population , who is probably in Jerusalem for the Passover celebration . Alexander and Rufus : the sons are named probably because they were known to the early Christians to whom Mark ’ s Gospel is addressed . - Mark 15:24 See note on Mt 27:35 . - Mark 15:25 Mark sketches the Passion in a quasi-liturgical fashion and as it were in thirds : the coming together of the Sanhedrin at the first hour (

NCB	Mark	15	42	Jesus Is Placed in the Tomb . [ k ] It was the Day of Preparation , that is , the day before the Sabbath . So when evening came ,
NCB	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathea , a respected member of the council , who was also awaiting the kingdom of God , boldly went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus .
NCB	Mark	15	44	Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead , and he summoned the centurion to ascertain that Jesus had indeed died .
NCB	Mark	15	45	When he learned from the centurion that such was the case , he turned over the body to Joseph .
NCB	Mark	15	46	Having purchased a linen shroud , he lowered Jesus from the cross , wrapped him in the shroud , and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of rock . He then rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb .
NCB	Mark	15	47	Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was buried . Footnotes - Mark 15:1 See notes on Mt 27:11-26 and 27:11 . - Mark 15:6 Outside the Gospels no such Passover privilege is explicitly found in other sources . However , this does not mean it didn ’ t exist . - Mark 15:9 According to Mark , Barabbas had been arrested in a rebellion , possibly in a political rebellion against the Romans . Thus , he was a hero with the people and fed their national pride . When Herod brings forth Jesus as the King of the Jews , the same people will have none of it—a Messiah reduced to a pitiful state , chained , and despised ! - Mark 15:16 See note on Mt 27:27-31 . - Mark 15:21 Those condemned to death were usually forced to carry the crossbeam of the cross , often

NCB	Mark	16	1	When the Sabbath was over , [ b ] Mary Magdalene , Mary the mother of James , and Salome purchased aromatic spices so that they might go and anoint Jesus .
NCB	Mark	16	2	And very early on the first day of the week , just after sunrise , they went to the tomb .
NCB	Mark	16	3	They had been asking each other , “ Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb ? ”
NCB	Mark	16	4	But when they looked up , they observed that the stone , which was extremely large , had already been rolled back .
NCB	Mark	16	5	On entering the tomb , they saw a young man arrayed in a white robe sitting on the right hand side , and they were stunned .
NCB	Mark	16	6	He said to them , “ Do not be alarmed . You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified . He has been raised . He is not here . See the place where they laid him .
NCB	Mark	16	7	But go forth and tell his disciples and Peter : ‘ He is going ahead of you to Galilee . There you will see him just as he told you. ’ ”

NCB	Mark	16	12	Jesus Appears to Two Disciples . After this , Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them as they were on their way into the country .

NCB	Mark	16	9	. - Mark 16:20 The Freer Logion : this passage is found in one manuscript , preserved in the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , and was known to St. Jerome in the 4th century . It is regarded as an interpolation to soften the condemnation of the disciples in v.
NCB	Luke	1	1	Sam 2:1-10 ) and has become the Christian song of thanksgiving , lends itself to be the prayer of those who have suffered but have never lost their hope in God . The entire prayer of the Old Testament converges upon this one , but with a wholly renewed power ; it is easy to see why the Church never tires of reciting it . It is one of the gems of the Church ’ s daily office of Evening Prayer ( Vespers ) . - Luke 1:67 The hour of light has come , and the Messiah is the star that rises ( v.
NCB	Luke	1	2	in accordance with their transmission to us by those who were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word from the beginning ,
NCB	Luke	1	3	I too , after researching all the evidence anew with great care , have decided to write an orderly account for you , Theophilus , who are so greatly revered ,
NCB	Luke	1	4	so that you may learn the unquestioned authenticity of the teachings you have received . The Infancy Narrative [ b ] Announcement of the Birth of John . [ c ] At the time of the reign of King Herod of Judea , [ d ] there was a priest named Zechariah , a member of the priestly order of Abijah . His wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron .
NCB	Luke	1	6	Both of them were righteous in the eyes of God , observing blamelessly all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord .
NCB	Luke	1	7	But they had no children , because Elizabeth was barren and both were advanced in years .
NCB	Luke	1	8	On one occasion , when his division was on duty and he was exercising his priestly office before God ,
NCB	Luke	1	9	he was designated by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and offer incense . [ e ]
NCB	Luke	1	10	At the hour of the offering of incense , all the people were outside , praying .
NCB	Luke	1	11	Then there appeared to him the angel of the Lord , standing to the right of the altar of incense .
NCB	Luke	1	12	When Zechariah beheld him , he was terrified and overcome with fear .
NCB	Luke	1	13	) . The husband belonged to the eighth class of priests (
NCB	Luke	1	14	He will be a source of joy and delight to you , and many will rejoice at his birth ,
NCB	Luke	1	15	for he will be great in the sight of the Lord . “ He will never imbibe wine or any strong drink . Even when he is still in his mother ’ s womb , he will be filled with the Holy Spirit ,
NCB	Luke	1	16	and he will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God .
NCB	Luke	1	17	With the spirit and power of Elijah he will go before him , to reconcile fathers with their children and to convert the disobedient to the ways of the righteous , so that a prepared people might be made ready for the Lord. ”
NCB	Luke	1	18	Zechariah said to the angel , “ How can I be assured of this ? For I am an old man and my wife is well past the stage of giving birth. ”
NCB	Luke	1	19	The angel replied , “ I am Gabriel . I stand in the presence of God , and I have been sent to speak to you and to convey to you this good news .
NCB	Luke	1	20	But now , because you did not believe my words , which will be fulfilled at their appointed time , you will lose your power of speech and will become mute until the day that these things take place. ”
NCB	Luke	1	21	Meanwhile , the people were waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he was delaying so long in the sanctuary .
NCB	Luke	1	22	When he did emerge , he could not speak to them , and they realized that he had seen a vision while he was in the sanctuary . He was only able to make signs to them , but he remained unable to speak .
NCB	Luke	1	23	When his term of service was completed , he returned home .
NCB	Luke	1	24	Shortly thereafter his wife Elizabeth conceived , and she remained in seclusion for five months , saying ,
NCB	Luke	1	25	“ The Lord has granted me this blessing , looking favorably upon me and removing from me the humiliation I have endured among my people. ” [ f ]
NCB	Luke	1	26	Announcement of the Birth of Jesus . [ g ] In the sixth month , [ h ] the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth ,
NCB	Luke	1	27	that she was “ betrothed ” ( pledged to be married ) clearly make this point . Mary had just entered her teens , for betrothal usually took place after puberty , but intercourse was not allowed until marriage . The betrothal could be severed only by divorce or death . - Luke 1:28 Hail , full of grace : this phrase may also be translated as “ Hail , O highly favored one. ” The Lord is with you : other ancient manuscripts add : “ Blessed are you among women ” ( as in Lk 1:42 ) . - Luke 1:34 I am a virgin : literally , “ I do not know man , ” “ know ” referring to the conjugal relationship . - Luke 1:36 In confirmation of what the angel has said to her , Mary is given word of the pregnancy of her aged relative Elizabeth . God has effected a pregnancy for a woman past childbearing years . Thus , he can effect a pregnancy for Mary also , because nothing is impossible for him . - Luke 1:39 By the account of the Visitation , Luke establishes the connection between the traditions about John and those about Jesus . At first commonplace , this meeting of two expectant mothers goes beyond the ordinary . As conscious believers , enlightened by the Holy Spirit , they understand that the time of salvation is inaugurated by the young lives they bear within themselves . We are already made aware that John bears witness to Jesus . And the first Christian generations place on the lips of Elizabeth the praise of Mary the believer . - Luke 1:39 A town of Judah : according to tradition , this was Ain Karim ,
NCB	Luke	1	28	The angel came to her and said , “ Hail , full of grace ! [ j ] The Lord is with you. ”
NCB	Luke	1	29	But she was greatly troubled by his words and wondered in her heart what this salutation could mean .
NCB	Luke	1	30	Then the angel said to her , “ Do not be afraid , Mary , for you have found favor with God .
NCB	Luke	1	31	Behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you will name him Jesus .
NCB	Luke	1	32	He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High . The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David .

NCB	Luke	1	35	) . The body of Jesus was to take form in the flesh of Mary , and this was to come about not through human planning but through the presence and action of God himself ( see Ex 40:34-35 ; Num 9:15 ; 10:34 ) , of the Spirit who creates and gives life ( Gen 1:2 ; Ps 104:30 ; Isa 11:1-6 ) . - Luke 1:26 In the sixth month : i.e. , after the time of John ’ s conception . - Luke 1:27 Virgin : i.e. , one who had not yet had sexual relations .

NCB	Luke	1	36	[ l ] And behold , your cousin Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son , and she who was called barren is now in her sixth month ,
NCB	Luke	1	37	for nothing will be impossible for God. ”
NCB	Luke	1	38	Then Mary said , “ Behold , I am the servant of the Lord . Let it be done to me according to your word. ” After this , the angel departed from her .
NCB	Luke	1	39	Mary Visits Elizabeth . [ m ] In those days , Mary set out and journeyed in haste into the hill country to a town of Judah [ n ]
NCB	Luke	1	40	where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth .
NCB	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the baby leaped in her womb . Then Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit ,
NCB	Luke	1	42	and she exclaimed with a loud cry , “ Blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb .
NCB	Luke	1	43	And why am I so greatly favored that the mother of my Lord should visit me ?
NCB	Luke	1	44	For behold , the moment that the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the child in my womb leaped for joy .
NCB	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she who believed that what the Lord has said to her will be fulfilled. ”
NCB	Luke	1	46	The Canticle of Mary . [ o ] And Mary said : “ My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord
NCB	Luke	1	47	and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior .
NCB	Luke	1	48	For he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant ; henceforth all generations will call me blessed .
NCB	Luke	1	49	The Mighty One has done great things for me , and holy is his name .
NCB	Luke	1	50	His mercy is shown from age to age to those who fear him .
NCB	Luke	1	51	He has shown the strength of his arm , he has routed those who are arrogant in the desires of their hearts .
NCB	Luke	1	52	He has brought down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up the lowly .
NCB	Luke	1	53	He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty .
NCB	Luke	1	54	He has come to the aid of Israel his servant , ever mindful of his merciful love ,
NCB	Luke	1	55	according to the promises he made to our ancestors , to Abraham and to his descendants forever. ”
NCB	Luke	1	56	Mary remained with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned to her home .
NCB	Luke	1	57	The Birth of John . When the time came for Elizabeth to give birth , she bore a son .
NCB	Luke	1	58	Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her , and they shared in her rejoicing .
NCB	Luke	1	59	On the eighth day , when they came to circumcise the child , they were going to name him Zechariah after his father .
NCB	Luke	1	60	However , his mother objected . “ No , ” she said . “ He is to be called John. ”
NCB	Luke	1	61	They said to her , “ There is no one in your family who has this name. ”
NCB	Luke	1	62	They then made signs to his father to ask what name he wanted to be given to the child .
NCB	Luke	1	63	He asked for a writing tablet , and he wrote : “ His name is John. ” They were all filled with wonder .
NCB	Luke	1	64	Immediately , his mouth was opened and his tongue was freed , and he began to speak , giving praise to God .
NCB	Luke	1	65	All their neighbors were overcome with awe , and all these things were related throughout the entire hill country of Judea .
NCB	Luke	1	66	All who heard them were deeply impressed , and they wondered , “ What then is this child going to be ? ” For the hand of the Lord was with him .
NCB	Luke	1	67	The Canticle of Zechariah . [ p ] Then the child ’ s father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied :
NCB	Luke	1	68	“ Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel , for he has visited his people and redeemed them .
NCB	Luke	1	69	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us from the house of his servant David ,
NCB	Luke	1	70	just as he proclaimed through the mouth of his holy prophets from age to age :
NCB	Luke	1	71	salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us ,
NCB	Luke	1	72	to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remain mindful of his holy covenant ,
NCB	Luke	1	73	the oath that he swore to our father Abraham , and to grant us that ,
NCB	Luke	1	74	delivered from the power of our enemies , without fear we might worship him
NCB	Luke	1	75	in holiness and righteousness in his presence all our days .
NCB	Luke	1	76	“ And you , my child , will be called prophet of the Most High , for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways ,
NCB	Luke	1	77	to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins ,

The Canticle of Zechariah , the Benedictus , rings out daily in the liturgical office of Morning Prayer ( Lauds ) . The whole faith of the Old Testament is woven into its proclamation of peace , that is , fulfillment and joy for humanity , as a gift from God .
NCB	Luke	1	79	to shine on those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet along the path of peace. ”
NCB	Luke	1	80	The Son of the Wilderness . The child grew and became strong in spirit . He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel . Footnotes - Luke 1:1 Like the Greek historians of his time , Luke begins his book with a prologue . He dedicates the work to a distinguished person , Theophilus ( otherwise unknown to us ) , who has already been taught the good news . Some scholars believe that the name is symbolic for it means “ lover of God , ” hence all Christians . - Luke 1:5 The Gospel is first and foremost a proclamation of what Jesus did and taught and , above all , of his Death and Resurrection for the salvation of humankind ; everything that the preachers of the mission and message of Jesus proclaimed led toward the mystery of Easter . But , like Matthew , Luke decided to preface all that with a description of the period preceding the public appearance of Jesus , because the Church wanted to know the mystery of Jesus back to its very beginnings .
NCB	Luke	1	5	The events described by Matthew , however , are not focused on the birth , which is recounted for us through the experiences of Joseph ; Luke speaks directly of the birth through the experience of Mary . Regarding Mary , the opening pages of the third Gospel have provided the Church down the centuries with an abundant , and still flowing , wellspring for its faith ( Marian teachings ) , its devotion ( the “ Hail , Mary ” ) , and its art . Some points emerge with utter clarity : Mary is the Mother of Jesus ; the birth took place at Bethlehem ; and the newborn child was placed in a manger . The primary statement made is undoubtedly this : that Jesus was born not by the will of human beings but by the initiative of God , and that he was born of a virgin mother . - Luke 1:5 The time is toward the end of the reign of Herod the Great ( 37–4 B.C. ) . A faithful and devout couple have been praying for the salvation of the people ( v.
NCB	Luke	1	100	miles south of Nazareth and four miles west of Jerusalem . - Luke 1:46 Mary ’ s splendid canticle , the Magnificat , proclaims a new course for history , the end of injustice , and the birth of a new world , that of the kingdom , in which everything is different from our habitual experience . Every people gives thanks to God ; the joy of the poor bursts forth ; hope is born for the salvation of the despised of this world . The Magnificat , which is very similar to the canticle of Hannah ( see
NCB	Luke	2	2	This was the first such registration , and it took place when Quirinius [ b ] was governor of Syria .
NCB	Luke	2	1	) . But the general census that Augustus has ordered is the instrument of providence for fulfilling the prophecies , since it leads to Mary ’ s journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem ( v.
NCB	Luke	2	3	Everyone traveled to his own town to be enrolled .
NCB	Luke	2	4	) . A 6th-century monk , Dionysius Exiguus ( “ Little Denis ” ) , wanted to mark the beginning of the Christian year , but he miscalculated and dated the birth of Jesus as occurring in the year
NCB	Luke	2	5	He went to be registered together with Mary , his betrothed , who was expecting a child .
NCB	Luke	2	6	, ten years after the death of Herod the Great . The information we have does not allow us to decide whether Luke is referring to this census or to another . - Luke 2:7 Manger : the legend of the ass and the cattle at the manger was perhaps suggested by Isa 1:3 . - Luke 2:14 On whom his favor rests : some read “ to men of goodwill , ” but it seems better not to contrast God ’ s peace and human goodwill . - Luke 2:21 This section describes the Jewish rites associated with a birth . In addition to circumcision , forty days after the birth Jewish parents celebrated the rites of purification and ransoming , which in the context of the ancient religion represented a respect for life and a sense of the sacred ( see Ex 13:2 ; Lev 12:2-8 ; Num 18:15-16 ) . This child , who is bought back with the offering of the poor , is the Messiah and has come to carry out the mission entrusted to the Servant as foretold in the great prophetic songs of Isaiah ( 42:6 ; 49:6 ; 52:10 ) : to save all of humankind , to bring light to all peoples . Some hearts are already drawn by the joyous conviction that the prophecies are fulfilled , and the hymn of the elderly prophet Simeon is , despite its brevity , among the richest of Christian canticles . But who can recognize the mission of the Messiah unless they accept the light of God ? That mission elicits hostility ; and Mary will experience the repercussions of the Savior ’ s painful lot , because faith in the Savior will bring to light the deep religion of hearts and put an end to the legalism of Judaism . - Luke 2:41 In the village where Jesus spends his apprenticeship as a human being and grows “ in wisdom and in age and in grace with God and men ( v.
NCB	Luke	2	7	and she gave birth to her firstborn son . She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger , [ c ] because there was no room for them in the inn .
NCB	Luke	2	8	In the nearby countryside there were shepherds living in the fields and keeping watch over their flock throughout the night .
NCB	Luke	2	9	Suddenly , an angel of the Lord appeared to them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them . They were terror-stricken ,
NCB	Luke	2	10	but the angel said to them , “ Do not be afraid , for I bring you good news of great joy for all the people .
NCB	Luke	2	11	For this day in the city of David there has been born to you a Savior who is Christ , the Lord .
NCB	Luke	2	12	“ This will be a sign for you : you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. ”
NCB	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God and saying ,

NCB	Luke	2	15	The Visit of the Shepherds . After the angels had departed from them to heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Come , let us go to Bethlehem to see this thing that has taken place , which the Lord has made known to us. ”
NCB	Luke	2	16	And so they set off in haste and found Mary and Joseph , and the baby lying in a manger .
NCB	Luke	2	17	When they saw the child , they recounted the message that had been told them about him .
NCB	Luke	2	18	All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them .
NCB	Luke	2	19	As for Mary , she treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart .
NCB	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds went back , glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen , just as they had been told .
NCB	Luke	2	21	The Circumcision and Naming of Jesus . [ e ] On the eighth day , when the time for the child ’ s circumcision had arrived , he was given the name Jesus , the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived in the womb .
NCB	Luke	2	22	Jesus Is Presented in the Temple . When the days for their purification were completed according to the Law of Moses , they brought the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord ,
NCB	Luke	2	23	as it is prescribed in the Law of the Lord : “ Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the Lord , ”
NCB	Luke	2	24	and to offer a sacrifice in accordance with what is stated in the Law of the Lord , “ a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. ”
NCB	Luke	2	25	The Prophecy of Simeon . At that time , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon . This upright and devout man was awaiting the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit rested on him .
NCB	Luke	2	26	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not experience death before he had seen the Christ of the Lord .
NCB	Luke	2	27	Prompted by the Spirit , Simeon came into the temple . When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was required by the Law ,
NCB	Luke	2	28	he took him in his arms and praised God , saying :
NCB	Luke	2	29	B.C.–A.D .
NCB	Luke	2	30	for my eyes have seen your salvation ,
NCB	Luke	2	31	which you have prepared in the sight of all the peoples ,
NCB	Luke	2	32	a light of revelation to the Gentiles and glory for your people Israel. ”
NCB	Luke	2	33	The child ’ s father and mother marveled at what was being said about him .
NCB	Luke	2	34	Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother : “ This child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel , and to be a sign that will be opposed ,
NCB	Luke	2	35	so that the secret thoughts of many will be revealed , and you yourself a sword will pierce. ”
NCB	Luke	2	36	The Witness of Anna . There was also present a prophetess , Anna , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher . She was very advanced in years , having lived with her husband for seven years after their marriage ,
NCB	Luke	2	37	and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four . She never left the temple , but worshiped with fasting and prayer night and day .
NCB	Luke	2	38	At that moment , she came forward and began to praise God , while she spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the deliverance of Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	2	39	The Return to Nazareth . When they had fulfilled everything required by the Law of the Lord , they returned to Galilee , to their own town of Nazareth .
NCB	Luke	2	40	The child grew and became strong , filled with wisdom , and God ’ s favor was upon him .
NCB	Luke	2	41	The Boy Jesus in the Temple . [ f ] Every year his parents used to go to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover .
NCB	Luke	2	42	And when Jesus was twelve years old , they made the journey as usual for the feast .
NCB	Luke	2	43	When the days of the feast were over and they set off for home , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . His parents were not aware of this .
NCB	Luke	2	44	Assuming that he was somewhere in the group of travelers , they journeyed for a day . Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends ,
NCB	Luke	2	45	but when they failed to find him , they returned to Jerusalem to search for him .
NCB	Luke	2	46	After three days they found him in the temple , where he was sitting among the teachers , listening to them and asking them questions .
NCB	Luke	2	47	And all who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers .
NCB	Luke	2	48	When they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him : “ Son , why have you done this to us ? Your father and I have been searching for you with great anxiety. ”
NCB	Luke	2	49	Jesus said to them , “ Why were you searching for me ? Did you not know that I must be in my Father ’ s house ? ”
NCB	Luke	2	50	But they did not comprehend what he said to them .
NCB	Luke	2	51	Jesus Grows in Wisdom and Grace . Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth , and he was obedient to them . His mother pondered all these things in her heart .
NCB	Luke	2	52	) , ” this favor of God did not prevent him from sharing the life lived by everyone else . Then a significant event interrupted the course of everyday life . Jesus had reached the age when a Jewish boy had completed his religious instruction and was beginning to observe the precepts of the Law ; he was recognized as religiously mature . Therefore , he joined his parents in the pilgrimage to Jerusalem . In this passage we find him in the temple in open discussion with those charged with teaching the Law . What he has to say reveals an extraordinary religious vision . In acting as he does , he claims a freedom that surprises his parents . Thus , at his first encounter with Judaism and its religious center , at the moment when he speaks for the first time , Jesus declares himself Son of God and is aware of his own mystery and of his mission . That is what Luke wants to bring out in this story . Mary and Joseph are now informed of the boy ’ s uncommon destiny , but the unexpected thunderbolt of Jesus ’ statement confuses them ; it utters a mystery that is beyond them . The Lord is not done with surprising even believers , indeed believers first of all ! There are days when we must draw inspiration from the attitude of Mary as she meditates on what God has done .
NCB	Luke	2	754	from the foundation of Rome ( instead of 6–7 years earlier ) . But the mistake is of little importance , for Dionysius ’ insight was correct : this event , more than any other , deserves to date the history of humanity , for it is the hinge on which all of history turns . - Luke 2:2 Quirinius : Publius Quirinius , legate of Syria , conducted a census of Palestine in A.D.
NCB	Luke	3	3	He journeyed throughout the entire region of the Jordan valley , proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins ,
NCB	Luke	3	1	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea , and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias [ b ] was tetrarch of Abilene ,
NCB	Luke	3	2	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , [ c ] the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the desert .
NCB	Luke	3	4	Esdras 14:11 ) . - Luke 3:23 It may be helpful to record another interpretation of the difference between this genealogy and that of Matthew : in virtue of the law of the levirate , Joseph ( it is said ) had two fathers , one biological ( Jacob ) , the other legal ( Heli ) ; thus two different lists are used as far back as Shealtiel .

NCB	Luke	3	14	generations , Luke lists
NCB	Luke	3	15	. He is named here because he still exercised considerable influence . - Luke 3:20 John ’ s imprisonment occurred sometime after the beginning of Jesus ’ ministry ( see Jn 3:22-24 ) . Luke mentions it here to bring his section on John ’ s ministry to a conclusion before starting his account of that of Jesus ( see also Mt 4:12 ; Mk 1:14 ) . Later he alludes to John ’ s death ( Lk 9:7-9 ) . See also note on Mk 1:14 . - Luke 3:21 Jesus here shows himself to be in solidarity with sinners by receiving the bath of repentance . But a unique event also takes place : The Messiah receives his investiture from heaven . The Holy Spirit will be present in him ( see Isa 11:2 ) ; over him are pronounced the words used in consecrating kings ( Ps 2:7 ) , but here they attest that he is the Son of God in a sense hitherto unsuspected ( see Lk 1:35 ) . - Luke 3:23 Luke gives a genealogy that is meant not as a historical document but as the assertion of a legal status . Jesus is linked to Joseph , even though it was known that the link was not one of blood ; the reason for doing so is that at that time only men and not women had rights . The genealogy then moves back to David , without following the line of kings . From that point it continues again , not only as far as Abraham , but—and this is the chief novelty of the passage—as far as Adam , who comes from the hand of God . Luke ’ s intention is to stress the point that Jesus belongs not only to the chosen people but to the entire human race , which he has come to save . Whereas Matthew specifically mentions three groups of
NCB	Luke	3	16	John answered , telling them all : “ I baptize you with water , but there is one coming who is more powerful than I am . I am not worthy to loosen the straps of his sandals . He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire .
NCB	Luke	3	17	His winnowing fan is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn , but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. ”
NCB	Luke	3	18	And with many other exhortations , he proclaimed the good news to the people .
NCB	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , after having been rebuked by John because of his affair with Herodias , his brother ’ s wife , in addition to all the other evil deeds he had done ,
NCB	Luke	3	20	added still this , that he put John in prison . [ d ]
NCB	Luke	3	21	The Baptism of Jesus . [ e ] After John had baptized all the people , and while Jesus was engaged in prayer after also having been baptized , heaven opened
NCB	Luke	3	22	and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove . And a voice came from heaven : “ You are my beloved Son ; in you I am well pleased. ”
NCB	Luke	3	23	The Genealogy of Jesus . [ f ] When Jesus began his ministry , he was about thirty years old . He was the son , as it was thought , of Joseph , [ g ] the son of Heli ,
NCB	Luke	3	24	the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph ,
NCB	Luke	3	25	the son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai ,

NCB	Luke	3	27	and Passover of
NCB	Luke	3	28	. But he also wants to contrast these earthly rulers and religious authorities with the sovereignty and authority of Jesus . The deeper movement of history does not take place at the level of official appearances ; in fact , it is Jesus who is fulfilling the destiny of the world by giving history its true meaning . Luke sums up in a single passage all the information that he intends to offer on the work of John . More than the other evangelists , he stresses the point that salvation is offered to everyone ; in his citation of Isaiah he highlights the final verse , thereby underscoring the thought that the new age is meant for the authentic children of Abraham and not solely for the chosen people . At the end of the passage he immediately jumps ahead to the imprisonment of John , of which Mark and Matthew speak at a later point and at greater length ( Mt 14:1-12 ; Mk 6:14-29 ) . His intention is to make a clear distinction between the Jesus movement and the Johannine movement : when the time of Christ begins , that of John , the forerunner , is finished . - Luke 3:1 Lysanias : an unknown governor . Abilene : a region northeast of Damascus . - Luke 3:2 Caiaphas was the current high priest ( A.D. 18–36 ) . Annas , that is , Ananiah , had preceded him from

The people of Nazareth become infuriated , but Jesus escapes their fury in a mysterious manner . - Luke 4:31 In the Gospel , the accounts of miracles are intended to attest , first of all , that God the Savior is present for people in Jesus Christ . There is a sensible and visible evil in the sickness , wherein we see hostile forces at work . Christ brings healing ; he changes the condition of human beings and saves them from alienation . Demons are sharper than humans in penetrating the divine powers of him who frees humans from the grip of death . However , Jesus reduces them to silence , because he does not want people to regard him as a triumphant liberator but to discover , in his words and actions as man amidst his human brothers and sisters , the true visage of the Messiah , Son of God . - Luke 4:34 See note on Mk 1:24 . - Luke 4:42 The good news of the kingdom , this announcement of the coming of God ( Lk 4:18 ; 6:20-28 ) , must reach all human beings .

NCB	Luke	4	7	All this will be yours if you worship me. ”
NCB	Luke	4	8	Jesus answered him : “ Scripture says : ‘ You shall worship the Lord your God , and him alone shall you serve. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	4	9	Next the devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the summit of the temple . Then he said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down from here ,
NCB	Luke	4	10	for according to Scripture : ‘ He will command his angels concerning you , to protect you , ’
NCB	Luke	4	11	and : ‘ With their hands they will raise you up lest you dash your foot against a stone. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	4	12	Jesus answered him , “ Scripture says : ‘ You shall not put the Lord your God to the test. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	4	13	When the devil had ended all his tempting , he departed from him until an opportune time . The Ministry of Jesus in Galilee [ b ]
NCB	Luke	4	14	Jesus Is Accepted throughout Galilee . Then Jesus , filled with the power of the Spirit , returned to Galilee , and reports about him began to spread throughout the surrounding region .
NCB	Luke	4	15	He taught in their synagogues and was praised by everyone .
NCB	Luke	4	16	Jesus at Nazareth . [ c ] When he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up , he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day , as was his custom . He stood up to read ,
NCB	Luke	4	17	;
NCB	Luke	4	18	“ The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor . He has sent me to proclaim release to prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind , to let the oppressed go free ,
NCB	Luke	4	19	and to proclaim the year of the Lord ’ s favor. ”
NCB	Luke	4	20	Then he rolled up the scroll , returned it to the attendant , and sat down . The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed intently on him .
NCB	Luke	4	21	Then he began by saying to them , “ Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. ”
NCB	Luke	4	22	All present spoke highly of him and were amazed at the gracious words that flowed from his lips . They also asked , “ Is this not the son of Joseph ? ”
NCB	Luke	4	23	He said to them , “ Undoubtedly you will quote to me the proverb : ‘ Physician , heal yourself , ’ and say : ‘ Do here in your hometown [ d ] the deeds we have heard that you performed in Capernaum. ’
NCB	Luke	4	24	Amen , I say to you , ” he went on , “ no prophet is accepted in his own country .
NCB	Luke	4	25	[ e ] “ I tell you in truth , there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the skies remained closed for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land .
NCB	Luke	4	26	Yet it was to none of them that Elijah was sent , but to a widow at Zarephath in the land of Sidon .
NCB	Luke	4	27	There were also many people with leprosy in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha , but not one of these was cleansed except for Naaman the Syrian. ”
NCB	Luke	4	28	When they heard these words , all the people in the synagogue were roused to fury . [ f ]
NCB	Luke	4	29	They leapt up , drove him out of the town , and led him to the top of the hill upon which their town was built , intending to hurl him off the cliff .
NCB	Luke	4	30	However , he passed through the midst of the crowd and went on his way .
NCB	Luke	4	31	Jesus Heals a Man with a Demon . [ g ] Jesus then went to Capernaum , a town in Galilee , and began to teach the people on the Sabbath .
NCB	Luke	4	32	They were astounded at his teaching because his message had authority .
NCB	Luke	4	33	In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon , and he shrieked loudly ,
NCB	Luke	4	34	“ Leave us alone ! What do you want with us , Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are—the Holy One of God. ” [ h ]
NCB	Luke	4	35	But Jesus rebuked him , saying , “ Be silent and come out of him ! ” Then the demon threw the man down in front of them and emerged from him without doing him any harm .
NCB	Luke	4	36	The people were all amazed , and they said to one another : “ What is this teaching ? For with authority and power he gives commands to unclean spirits , and they come forth. ”
NCB	Luke	4	37	And reports about him began to spread throughout the entire region .
NCB	Luke	4	38	Jesus Heals Peter ’ s Mother-in-Law . On leaving the synagogue , he entered Simon ’ s house . Simon ’ s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever , and they begged him to help her .
NCB	Luke	4	39	Jesus stood over her and rebuked the fever , and it left her . She got up immediately and began to serve them .
NCB	Luke	4	40	Jesus Ministers throughout Galilee . At sunset they brought to him all those who were sick with various diseases . He laid his hands on each of them and healed them .
NCB	Luke	4	41	Demons also emerged from many people , shouting , “ You are the Son of God ! ” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Christ .
NCB	Luke	4	42	Jesus Is the Envoy of God for All Israel . [ i ] At daybreak he departed and made his way to a secluded place . But the crowds went forth in search of him , and when they located him , they tried to prevent him from leaving there .
NCB	Luke	4	43	However , he said to them , “ I must preach the kingdom of God to the other towns as well , because this was the purpose for which I was sent. ”
NCB	Luke	4	44	Thus , he continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea . Footnotes - Luke 4:1 By means of images , we are shown the drama Jesus experienced in his conscience , his struggle to follow with determination the great options of his existence . He knows the temptations for immediate success , domination , and prestige , the temptations to which Israel succumbed during its sojourn in the desert and that remain the lot of the Church , every believer , and every person . Jesus refuses to use his powers for his own benefit but accepts poverty and destitution ; he does not seek the glory of a political Messiah and does not yield to the idols of power . He turns away from the seduction of prestige ; when he goes to Jerusalem it will not be to mount the pinnacle of the temple but to carry the supreme trial of the cross . There is , in this choice without compromise , a radical recognition of God and the true values he is forever giving us to reflect upon . The victory of Christ over the forces of evil foreshadows the power of his mission ( see Lk 10:18 ; 11:22 ; 12:16 ) , which is achieved through patience on the cross and the triumph of the Resurrection after the final attacks of the spirit of evil ( see Lk 22:3 ,
NCB	Luke	4	53	) . To live with Christ is to accept this struggle humbly and resolutely . - Luke 4:14 The Gospel does not try to reconstitute an exact chronology and geography of the life of Christ . Its intention is to present to us the sayings and actions of the Lord , to arouse and renew our faith in him , and to make us grasp the essential requirements of our existence . As in Matthew and Mark , the first stage of Jesus ’ mission , which takes place in Galilee , leads to the recognition of Jesus as it moves from the first question about him to the profession of faith . - Luke 4:16 By reading his own vocation and mission in the great passage from Isaiah ( 61:1 ) , Jesus will direct the thinking of the Church and every apostle : God ’ s work is to proclaim salvation to the poor and the oppressed . - Luke 4:23 Hometown : i.e. , Nazareth , where Jesus was brought up . Capernaum : see notes on Mt 4:12-17 ; 4:12 ; and 4:13 . - Luke 4:25 These verses illustrate the theme of universal salvation , so dear to Luke , with allusions to the miracles of Elijah and Elisha (
NCB	Luke	5	5	Simon answered , “ Master , we worked hard throughout the night and caught nothing ; but if you say so , I will let down the nets. ”
NCB	Luke	5	1	One day , as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret , with people crowding around him to hear the word of God ,
NCB	Luke	5	2	he caught sight of two boats at the water ’ s edge . The fishermen had gotten out of the boats and were washing their nets .
NCB	Luke	5	3	Getting into one of the boats , the one belonging to Simon , he asked him to put out a little way from the shore . Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat .
NCB	Luke	5	4	When he had finished speaking , he said to Simon , “ Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch. ”
NCB	Luke	5	6	When they had done this , they caught such a great number of fish that their nets were beginning to tear .
NCB	Luke	5	7	Therefore , they signaled to their companions in the other boat to come and help them . They came and filled both boats to the point that they were in danger of sinking .
NCB	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw what had happened , he fell at the knees of Jesus , saying , “ Depart from me , Lord , for I am a sinful man. ”
NCB	Luke	5	9	For he and all of his companions were amazed at the catch they had made .
NCB	Luke	5	10	So too were Simon ’ s partners James and John , the sons of Zebedee . Then Jesus said to Simon , “ Do not be afraid . From now on you will be catching men. ”
NCB	Luke	5	11	When they brought their boats to the shore , they left everything and followed him .
NCB	Luke	5	12	Jesus Heals a Man with Leprosy . [ b ] In one of the towns that he visited , a man appeared whose body was covered with leprosy . When he saw Jesus , he fell prostrate before him and pleaded for his help , saying , “ Lord , if you choose to do so , you can make me clean. ”
NCB	Luke	5	13	He stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , “ I do choose . Be made clean. ” Immediately , the leprosy left him .
NCB	Luke	5	14	He then instructed him to tell no one . “ Just go , ” he said , “ and show yourself to the priest , and make an offering for your cleansing , as prescribed by Moses . That will be proof for them. ”
NCB	Luke	5	15	However , the reports about him continued to spread , so that large crowds assembled to listen to him and to be healed of their diseases .
NCB	Luke	5	16	But he would withdraw to deserted places to pray .
NCB	Luke	5	17	Jesus Pardons and Heals a Paralyzed Man . [ c ] One day , as he was teaching , Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there . They had come from every village of Galilee and Judea , and from Jerusalem . And he possessed the power of the Lord to heal .
NCB	Luke	5	18	Then some men appeared , carrying a paralyzed man on a bed . They tried to bring him in and set him down in front of Jesus .
NCB	Luke	5	19	However , finding no way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up onto the roof and lowered him on the bed through the tiles into the middle of the crowd surrounding Jesus .
NCB	Luke	5	20	On perceiving their faith , Jesus said , “ Friend , your sins are forgiven you. ”
NCB	Luke	5	21	Then the scribes and the Pharisees began to ask each other , “ Who is this man uttering blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? ”
NCB	Luke	5	22	Jesus discerned what they were thinking , and he said in reply , “ Why do you entertain such thoughts in your hearts ?
NCB	Luke	5	23	Which is easier—to say : ‘ Your sins are forgiven you , ’ or to say : ‘ Stand up and walk ’ ?
NCB	Luke	5	24	But that you may come to realize that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the paralyzed man— “ I say to you , stand up , and take your bed , and go to your home. ”
NCB	Luke	5	25	Immediately , the man stood up before them , picked up his bed , and went home glorifying God .
NCB	Luke	5	26	They were all overcome with amazement , and they praised God as , awestruck , they said , “ We have witnessed unbelievable things today. ”
NCB	Luke	5	27	Jesus Calls Levi ( Matthew ) . [ d ] [ e ] After this , he went out and noticed a tax collector named Levi sitting at his customs post . Jesus said to him , “ Follow me , ”
NCB	Luke	5	28	and , leaving everything behind , he got up and followed him .
NCB	Luke	5	29	Jesus Dines with Sinners . Then Levi gave a great banquet in his house for him , and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were at table with them .
NCB	Luke	5	30	The Pharisees and their scribes complained to his disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ” [ f ]
NCB	Luke	5	31	Jesus said to them in reply , “ It is not the healthy who need a physician , but rather those who are sick .
NCB	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. ”
NCB	Luke	5	33	A Time of Joy and Grace . [ g ] Then they said to him , “ John ’ s disciples fast frequently and pray often , and the disciples of the Pharisees do likewise , but your disciples eat and drink. ”
NCB	Luke	5	34	Jesus said to them , “ How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is still with them ?
NCB	Luke	5	35	But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then , in those days , they will fast. ”
NCB	Luke	5	36	He also told them this parable : “ No one tears a piece from a new cloak and sews it on an old cloak . If he does , the new cloak will be torn , and the piece from it will not match that of the old .
NCB	Luke	5	37	Nor does anyone pour new wine into old wineskins . If he does , the new wine will burst the skins and spill out , and the skins will be destroyed .
NCB	Luke	5	38	Rather new wine must be put into fresh wineskins .
NCB	Luke	5	39	And no one who has been drinking old wine will wish for new wine , for he says , ‘ The old is better. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 5:1 This passage demonstrates the art of the writer . Luke inserts the call of the first disciples into a context of preaching and performing mighty deeds . He slightly weakens the abrupt character that the event retains in Mark ( 1:16-18 ) and gives a greater human plausibility to the response of these men . But he stresses just as much the demands of the apostolic task . Trying to draw people away from the evils that assail them entails many difficulties . God requires humans to participate in this endeavor and to carry out their missionary work as a team in which all must share the pain . In this passage , Peter already occupies a representative place . Nonetheless , upon meeting Christ he discovers how much he himself is the victim of evil and sin . Jesus expects those who are his to be totally committed to the Word and , if necessary , to renounce their profession , their situation , and their security . - Luke 5:12 When duly confirmed as the Law requires ( see Lev 14:2-3 ) , the cure of a leper will attest to the priests the power of Jesus over an evil that destroys humans . - Luke 5:17 The description of the miracle worked for the paralyzed man is vivid , as in Matthew and Mark , even if , in order to make it more intelligible to his readers , Luke speaks simply of a roof instead of a Palestinian roof-terrace . - Luke 5:27 No one could be regarded as more of a sinner in the time of Jesus than the tax collectors ( also translated as “ publicans ” ) sitting at their customs post . Christ , more than once , created a scandal in the eyes of right-thinking people , who were quick to distinguish between the righteous and sinners . The Church recalls these occasions to keep herself from becoming a closed sect . The lesson is still valid today : to refuse to associate with others because we have catalogued them as sinners and because we consider ourselves to be in the ranks of the righteous is opposed to the Gospel . We must all regard ourselves as sinners and rejoice over the salvation that Jesus offers everyone . Moreover , only those receive salvation who loyally acknowledge the need of being saved . - Luke 5:27 See notes on Mt 5:46 and Mk 2:14 . - Luke 5:30 Sinners : see note on Mk 2:15 . - Luke 5:33 For the moment , Jesus refuses to impose on his disciples the ascetic and devout practices of Judaism . ( See note on Mk 2:20 . ) The Messiah is here—it is a time of joy . God , so to speak , becomes the Spouse of all people . The three Synoptic Gospels add other sentences , which underline the newness of the Gospel . It is not a rearrangement of ancient law and doctrines ; the New Covenant requires a new mentality and a new openness . The last verse , proper to Luke , alludes to the refusal to accept the Gospel on the part of the teachers of the law . They rejected the wonderful newness of the Gospel and were content with the teachings to which they were accustomed .
NCB	Luke	6	6	corresponds to the “ Sermon on the Mount , ” which the Gospel of Matthew places at the beginning of Jesus ’ activity ( Mt 5–7 ) . Luke offers a more concise and less solemn text . His readers have little knowledge of Jewish life ; it was therefore pointless to contrast the old Law with the demands of the Gospel . The latter are stated in a more absolute manner . Matthew describes the interior attitude , the disposition of heart , without which no one can enter the kingdom of God . Luke prefers to evoke a more concrete and living tone . He underlines with special insistence the deportment in regard to riches ; this is the test of entrance into the kingdom . - Luke 6:20 The Beatitudes of the Gospel of Matthew bring forth an unexpected message ( Mt 5:3-12 ) . The short sentences in which Luke opposes the blessedness and woe of people reach us in an even more powerful manner . The Old Testament loved such contrasting formulas , but here the reader is directly challenged : “ you. ” In announcing the kingdom Jesus overturns the system of values on which we base our lives , relations , judgments , and actions . He denounces as false our more recurrent ideas . More than once , Luke underlines God ’ s predilection for the most deprived , who do not let themselves be deceived by pretension or by riches . Here we touch upon an essential point of a Christian conception of existence . - Luke 6:27 Love your enemies—here is one of the most revolutionary slogans of the Gospel for each age and each existence . It is quite common to recommend solidarity with those who are near to us through family , religion , homeland , or political affiliation . Judaism , for example , insisted on love of neighbor inside the community . Jesus shatters all limits and sweeps away all objections that restrict charity . For him , the call to love others is not guided by our preferences but by the need and distress of others . The correlation of conflicts and hatred must be broken . A love that is gratuitous and without boundaries—like the love of God taught to us by Jesus—is the mark of a true disciple . The Lord himself gave us an example of such love on the cross ( see Lk 23:34 ) . - Luke 6:37 These varied sentences have to do with the relations of people to one another . Developed is the meaning of mercy ( v.
NCB	Luke	6	1	Sam 21:2-7 ) ; in his act of healing Jesus recalls the true meaning of the Sabbath . See notes on Mt 12:1-14 ; 12:2 ; 12:3-4 ; 12:5-6 ; 12:8 ; 12:9-14 . - Luke 6:5 Son of Man : see note on Mt 8:20 . - Luke 6:12 This is an important moment in Luke ’ s eyes , as shown by the fact that Jesus prepares himself through prayer . The apostles are twelve in number in order to make clear their future work , which is comparable to that of the twelve tribes of Israel : that is , they are the builders of the new People of God ( see Acts 1:25 ) . The word “ apostle ” is derived from a Greek word meaning “ sent , ” “ missionary. ” - Luke 6:17 The picture of the crowds pressing upon Jesus shows the hope raised by Jesus from the very beginning of his public ministry . People came to him from everywhere , even from the nearby pagan towns , to obtain healing . Jesus came among us as the sign of salvation and the act by which God delivered it to us . When giving the Beatitudes in the Sermon on the Plain , he will announce the true salvation . - Luke 6:20 The remainder of ch .
NCB	Luke	6	2	Some of the Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what is forbidden on the Sabbath ? ”
NCB	Luke	6	3	Jesus answered them , “ Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry ?
NCB	Luke	6	4	He entered the house of God and took and ate the sacred bread that only the priests were permitted to eat , and he shared it with his companions. ”
NCB	Luke	6	5	Then he said to them , “ The Son of Man , [ b ] is lord of the Sabbath. ” A Man with a Withered Hand .
NCB	Luke	6	7	The scribes and the Pharisees watched him closely to see whether he would cure him on the Sabbath so that they would have a charge to bring against him .
NCB	Luke	6	8	But Jesus was fully aware of their thoughts , and he said to the man with the withered hand , “ Come here and stand before us. ” The man got up and stood there .
NCB	Luke	6	9	Then Jesus said to them , “ I put this question to you : Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath , to save life or to destroy it ? ”
NCB	Luke	6	10	After looking around at all of them , he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He did so , and his hand was restored .
NCB	Luke	6	11	But they were filled with fury and discussed among themselves what they might do with Jesus .
NCB	Luke	6	12	Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles . [ c ] It was in those days that he went onto the mountain to pray , and he spent the entire night in prayer to God .
NCB	Luke	6	13	Then , when it was daylight , he summoned his disciples and chose twelve of them , whom he designated as apostles :
NCB	Luke	6	14	Simon , to whom he gave the name Peter , and his brother Andrew , James , John , Philip , Bartholomew ,
NCB	Luke	6	15	Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , Simon called the Zealot ,
NCB	Luke	6	16	Judas the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor .
NCB	Luke	6	17	The Crowds Seek Out Jesus . [ d ] He then came down with them and stood on a spot of level ground , where there was a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all sections of Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon .
NCB	Luke	6	18	They had come there to listen to him and to be healed of their diseases . Those who were afflicted by unclean spirits were cured .
NCB	Luke	6	19	And everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him , because power came forth from him and healed them all . The Sermon on the Plain [ e ]
NCB	Luke	6	20	The Beatitudes . [ f ] Then , turning to his disciples , he began to speak : “ Blessed are you who are poor , for the kingdom of God is yours .
NCB	Luke	6	21	Blessed are you who hunger now , for you will have your fill . Blessed are you who weep now , for you will laugh .
NCB	Luke	6	22	“ Blessed are you when people hate you and ostracize you , when they insult you and denounce your name as evil on account of the Son of Man .
NCB	Luke	6	23	Rejoice on that day and dance for joy , for your reward will be great in heaven . This was the way their ancestors treated the Prophets .
NCB	Luke	6	24	“ But woe to you who are rich , for you have received your consolation .
NCB	Luke	6	25	Woe to you who are well fed now , for you will go hungry . Woe to you who laugh now , for you will mourn and weep .
NCB	Luke	6	26	Woe to you when all speak well of you , for their ancestors treated the false prophets in the same fashion .
NCB	Luke	6	27	Love of Enemies . [ g ] “ But to those of you who are listening to me , I say : Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you ,
NCB	Luke	6	28	bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you .
NCB	Luke	6	29	If anyone strikes you on one cheek , offer him the other cheek as well , and should someone take your cloak , let him have your tunic as well .
NCB	Luke	6	30	Give to everyone who begs from you , and do not demand the return of what is yours from the one who has taken it .
NCB	Luke	6	31	“ Deal with others as you would like them to deal with you .
NCB	Luke	6	32	If you love only those who love you , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners love those who love them .
NCB	Luke	6	33	And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners do as much .
NCB	Luke	6	34	And if you lend only to those from whom you expect to be repaid , what credit is that to you ? Even sinners lend to sinners , expecting to be repaid in full .
NCB	Luke	6	35	“ Rather , you must love your enemies and do good to them , and lend without expecting any repayment . In this way , you will receive a great reward . You will be sons of the Most High , for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked .
NCB	Luke	6	36	Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful .
NCB	Luke	6	37	) . In Matthew ’ s Gospel , the parable of the blind leading the blind is used to denounce the false teachers of Judaism ( Mt 15:13-14 ) . In Luke , it has become a recommendation of clear-sightedness addressed to the disciples . This varied usage of the same theme demonstrates the liberty of the evangelists—or of tradition—in the working out of a theme . - Luke 6:43 An authentic life does not deceive ; it is by someone ’ s acts that we discern what truly fills the heart . True disciples are not satisfied with talk and appearances . For them , listening to the Word of God means transforming their whole existence .
NCB	Luke	6	38	) , and clear-sightedness regarding self that prevents one from judging others ( v.
NCB	Luke	6	39	Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind . He also told them a parable : “ Can one blind man guide another who is also blind ? Will not both of them fall into a pit ?
NCB	Luke	6	40	No student is greater than his teacher , but a fully trained student will be like his teacher .
NCB	Luke	6	41	“ Why do you take note of the splinter in your brother ’ s eye but do not notice the wooden plank in your own eye ?
NCB	Luke	6	42	How can you say to your brother , ‘ Brother , let me remove the splinter that is in your eye , ’ while all the time you do not notice the wooden plank that is in your own eye ? You hypocrite ! First remove the wooden plank from your own eye , and then you will be able to see clearly enough to remove the splinter that is in your brother ’ s eye .
NCB	Luke	6	43	A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit . [ i ] “ No healthy tree can bear rotten fruit , nor does a rotting tree bear healthy fruit .
NCB	Luke	6	44	Every tree is known by its own fruit . For people do not pick figs from thornbushes or grapes from brambles .
NCB	Luke	6	45	A good man produces good from the store of goodness in his heart , whereas an evil man produces evil from the store of evil within him . For the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart .
NCB	Luke	6	46	Parable of the Two Foundations. “ Why do you call me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ but fail to do what I tell you ?
NCB	Luke	6	47	I will show you what everyone is like who comes to me and hears my words and acts in accordance with them .
NCB	Luke	6	48	He is like a man who in building a house dug deeply and laid its foundations on rock . When the flood rose , it burst against that house but could not shake it because it had been solidly constructed .
NCB	Luke	6	49	In contrast , the one who hears and does not act in accordance with my words is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation . As soon as the river burst against it , the house collapsed and was completely destroyed. ” Footnotes - Luke 6:1 In resisting servitude to traditions , Jesus gives the example of the freedom David showed in face of the Law ( see
NCB	Luke	7	7	That is the reason why I did not presume to approach you personally . But say the word and let my servant be healed .
NCB	Luke	7	1	Ki 17:17-24 ;
NCB	Luke	7	2	Ki 4:18-37 ) . - Luke 7:18 Jesus answers John by telling him of the signs which he , Jesus , is performing : those foreseen by the Prophets ( Ps 72:2 , 12-13 ; Isa 61:1-2 ) . He is not the liberator of a nation but someone who takes the side of the wretched and marginalized of this world ( see Lk 4:16-19 ) . - Luke 7:24 John the Baptist , messenger of the Savior , surpasses the Prophets because he precedes and announces the coming of the Lord ( Lk 1:17 ,
NCB	Luke	7	3	When he heard about Jesus , he sent some Jewish elders to ask him if he would come and heal his servant .
NCB	Luke	7	4	When they came to Jesus , they pleaded earnestly with him , saying , “ He deserves this favor from you ,
NCB	Luke	7	5	for he loves our people , and he was the one who built our synagogue for us. ”
NCB	Luke	7	6	Jesus went with them . When he drew near the house , the centurion sent friends to say to him , “ Lord , do not trouble yourself , for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof .
NCB	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man subject to authority , with soldiers who are subject to me . I say to one : ‘ Go , ’ and he goes , and to another : ‘ Come here , ’ and he comes , and to my servant : ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NCB	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these words , he was amazed , and , turning to the crowd that was following him , he said , “ I tell you , in no one throughout Israel have I found faith as great as this. ”
NCB	Luke	7	10	When the messengers returned to the house , they found the servant completely healthy .
NCB	Luke	7	11	Jesus Raises the Son of a Widow . [ c ] Soon afterward , Jesus went to a town called Nain , accompanied by his disciples and a large crowd .
NCB	Luke	7	12	As he drew near to the gate of the town , a man who had died was being carried out , the only son of his widowed mother . A large group of people from the town accompanied her .
NCB	Luke	7	13	When the Lord saw her , he was filled with compassion , and he said to her , “ Do not weep. ”
NCB	Luke	7	14	After this , he came forward and touched the bier , and the bearers halted . Then he said , “ Young man , I say to you , arise ! ”
NCB	Luke	7	15	The dead man sat up and began to speak , and Jesus gave him to his mother .
NCB	Luke	7	16	Fear seized all who were present , and they glorified God , saying , “ A great prophet has risen among us , ” and “ God has visited his people. ”
NCB	Luke	7	17	verses in this section recount two miracles of Christ , which highlight his mission both to the Jews and to the Gentiles . The next
NCB	Luke	7	18	Jesus Answers the Baptist ’ s Question . [ d ] When the disciples of John brought him reports about all these things ,
NCB	Luke	7	19	John designated two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask , “ Are you the one who is to come , or are we to wait for another ? ”
NCB	Luke	7	20	When they came to him , they said , “ John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask : ‘ Are you the one who is to come , or are we to wait for another ? ’ ”
NCB	Luke	7	21	At that time , Jesus had just cured many people of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits , and had restored the sight of many who were blind .
NCB	Luke	7	22	And he gave them this reply : “ Go back and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , those who have leprosy are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised to life , the poor have the good news proclaimed to them .
NCB	Luke	7	23	And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me. ”
NCB	Luke	7	24	Jesus Praises John the Baptist . [ e ] When John ’ s messengers had departed , Jesus spoke to the crowds about John : “ What did you go out into the desert to see ? A reed swaying in the wind ?
NCB	Luke	7	25	What did you go out to see ? Someone robed in fine clothing ? Those who are robed in gorgeous clothing and live luxuriously are to be found in royal palaces .
NCB	Luke	7	26	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and far more than a prophet .
NCB	Luke	7	27	This is the one about whom it is written : ‘ Behold , I am sending my messenger ahead of you , who will prepare your way before you. ’
NCB	Luke	7	28	“ I tell you , among those born of women , no one is greater than John , and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ”
NCB	Luke	7	29	( All the people who heard him , including the tax collectors , acknowledged the saving justice of God , for they had received John ’ s baptism .
NCB	Luke	7	30	However , the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law who had refused his baptism rejected God ’ s plan for them . )
NCB	Luke	7	31	Indecisive Children. “ Then to what shall I compare the people of this generation ? What are they like ?
NCB	Luke	7	32	They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other : ‘ We played the flute for you , but you would not dance ; we sang a dirge , and you refused to mourn. ’
NCB	Luke	7	33	verses then have to do with Jesus and the Baptist . The first Christian generations no doubt encountered groups who were followers of John the Baptist . Hence , it was most necessary to comprehend well the destiny of this prophet . Several times Luke sketches a parallel between John and Jesus ( see Lk 1:5-56 ; 3:1-20 ; 9:7-9 ) . Each time the Baptist impresses us by his courage , and each time Christ ’ s mission seems so different from his . Between these two destinies there is a kind of rupture , the difference of the two Testaments . - Luke 7:1 Every miracle testifies to Christ ’ s power to save people . But this miracle is reported above all to teach the cost of faith in Jesus and to astound us with the faith of a pagan . Luke describes the deep religious attitude of this man . At that time , it was only at great cost that a Roman official would invite a Jew or show consideration for the one God worshiped by a conquered people . This miracle , granted to a pagan who trusted solely in the power of Jesus , discreetly announces the call of non-Jews to salvation ( see Acts 10:34-35 ) . - Luke 7:11 Luke is the only one who reports this incident , which takes place in a village in the area of Nazareth . God manifests himself once again as he did in the time of the prophets Elijah and Elisha ( see
NCB	Luke	7	34	The Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say : ‘ Look at him ! He is a glutton and a drunkard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners. ’
NCB	Luke	7	35	Yet wisdom is proved right by all her children. ”
NCB	Luke	7	36	Jesus Pardons a Sinful Woman . [ f ] One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to dine with him . When he arrived at the Pharisee ’ s house , he took his place at table .
NCB	Luke	7	37	A woman of that town , who was leading a sinful life , learned that Jesus was a dinner guest in the Pharisee ’ s house . Carrying with her an alabaster jar of ointment , [ g ]
NCB	Luke	7	38	she stood behind him at his feet , weeping , and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair . Then she kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment .
NCB	Luke	7	39	When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this , he said to himself , “ If this man were really a prophet , he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him—that she is a sinner. ”
NCB	Luke	7	40	Jesus then said to the Pharisee , “ Simon , I have something to say to you. ” He replied , “ What is it , Teacher ? ”
NCB	Luke	7	41	“ There were two men who were in debt to a certain creditor . One owed him five hundred denarii , and the other owed fifty .
NCB	Luke	7	42	When they were unable to repay him , he canceled both debts . Now which one of them will love him more ? ”
NCB	Luke	7	43	Simon answered , “ I would imagine that it would be the one who was forgiven the larger amount. ” Jesus replied , “ You have judged rightly. ”
NCB	Luke	7	44	Then , turning toward the woman , he said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? I entered your home , and you provided no water for my feet , but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
NCB	Luke	7	45	You gave me no kiss , but she has not ceased to kiss my feet from the time I came in .
NCB	Luke	7	46	You did not anoint my head with oil , but she has anointed my feet with ointment .
NCB	Luke	7	47	Therefore , I tell you : her many sins have been forgiven her because she has shown great love . But the one who has been forgiven little has little love. ”
NCB	Luke	7	48	Then Jesus said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven. ”
NCB	Luke	7	49	Those who were at table began to say to themselves , “ Who is this man who even forgives sins ? ”
NCB	Luke	7	50	But Jesus said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you . Go in peace. ” Footnotes - Luke 7:1 The first
NCB	Luke	7	76	; Mal 3:1 ) , but Jesus alone inaugurates this new time of the kingdom . The austere preaching of John moved the people and the tax collectors , those who were despised , whereas the officials of the religion rejected him in the same way they disdained the call to joy addressed to them by Jesus . This shows the narrow-mindedness of those who believe themselves wise in the face of the unexpected accomplished by God . But the true believers welcome the plan of the Lord who saves , i.e. , his “ wisdom. ” - Luke 7:36 The other three evangelists place this incident just before the Passion . Luke , however , keeps it here to show that his primary concern is with the mercy and forgiveness of God . He is the only evangelist to hand down the memory of good relations between Jesus and the Pharisees who invite him to dine ( see also Lk 11:37 ; 14:1 ) : these men , too , are children of Israel and will be given the instruction that they really need . - Luke 7:37 The woman is certainly not Mary Magdalene ( see Lk 8:2 ) nor Mary the sister of Lazarus ( Lk 10:39 ; Jn 11:5 ) . The immense popularity of Mary Magdalene was due to a confusion , which occurred as far back as Christian antiquity , between the sinful woman who is forgiven here and the real Mary Magdalene , who was one of the main figures on Calvary and at the tomb .
NCB	Luke	8	8	And some fell onto good soil , and when it grew it produced a crop of a hundredfold. ” After saying this , he cried out , “ He who has ears to hear , let him hear. ” The Purpose of Parables . [ c ]

NCB	Luke	8	2	[ a ] as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary , called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out ;
NCB	Luke	8	3	Joanna , the wife of Herod ’ s steward Chuza ; Susanna ; and many others . These women provided for them out of their own resources . The Parable of the Sower . [ b ]
NCB	Luke	8	4	When a large crowd gathered together as people from every town flocked to him , he said in a parable :
NCB	Luke	8	5	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some of the seed fell along the path and was trampled upon , and the birds of the sky ate it up .
NCB	Luke	8	6	Some fell on rock , and when it came up , it withered for lack of moisture .
NCB	Luke	8	7	Some seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew with it and choked it .
NCB	Luke	8	9	Then his disciples asked him what the parable meant .
NCB	Luke	8	10	) ? No . The secret is not forever . Soon the disciples will bring the message to all people ( see Lk 12:1-12 ) . How will they receive it ? We will be judged on the yield of the Word in our life ( see Lk 19:25-26 ) . - Luke 8:19 The true family of Jesus is made up of those who hearken to the Word . Luke places this episode as a conclusion to the texts on receiving the Gospel . Belonging to Jesus is the joy of the believer . - Luke 8:20 Brethren : i.e. , according to Hebrew idiom , close relatives . See note on Mt 12:46 . - Luke 8:22 God alone is master of the sea ( see Pss 65:7 ; 89:10 ; 107:25-28 ) . The authority of Jesus over the unleashed elements shows his power divine . - Luke 8:26 The incident is meant to show that Jesus is stronger than all the forces of evil lumped together , the forces of Satan himself . Jesus goes to face these forces in a pagan region east of the Lake of Tiberias , where , it was thought , Satan must be reigning supreme . There is a herd of pigs there , animals unclean in Jewish eyes ; the herd dashes over the cliff , signifying the return of the demons to their hell . - Luke 8:40 This episode places before us two distressed people . The first is a father on the verge of losing his young daughter , with the rites of mourning under the specter of death already organized . The second is a woman humiliated by a sickness that carries the stigma of legal impurity , preventing her from participating in religious services and from approaching the Prophet ( see Lev 15:19-27 ) . Jesus intervenes in their distress and manifests his power and goodness , both of which are those of God . Nevertheless , he refuses to give his intervention a dramatic character ; the only witnesses of the girl ’ s raising from the dead—described in the same way as the action of Elijah ( see
NCB	Luke	8	11	The Explanation of the Parable of the Sower . [ d ] “ The meaning of the parable is this . The seed is the word of God .
NCB	Luke	8	12	The seed on the path represents those who hear , but then the devil comes and carries off the word from their hearts so that they may not come to believe and be saved .
NCB	Luke	8	13	Those on rock are the ones who , when they hear the word , receive it with joy . But these have no root ; they believe for a short while , but in time of trial they fall away .
NCB	Luke	8	14	“ That which has fallen among thorns are the ones who have heard , but as they go along , they are choked by the concerns and riches and pleasures of life , and they fail to produce mature fruit .
NCB	Luke	8	15	But that which is on rich soil are the ones who , when they have heard the word with a good and upright heart , keep it and yield a harvest through their perseverance .
NCB	Luke	8	16	The Parable of the Lamp . [ e ] “ No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a pot or places it under a bed . Rather he places it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light .
NCB	Luke	8	17	For nothing is hidden that will not be disclosed , and nothing is concealed that will not be made known and brought to light .
NCB	Luke	8	18	Take great care , therefore , about how you listen . For to the one who has , more will be given ; from the one who does not have , even what he thinks he has will be taken away. ”
NCB	Luke	8	19	The True Family of Jesus . [ f ] Then his mother and his brethren arrived , looking for him , but they could not get near him because of the crowd .
NCB	Luke	8	20	He was told , “ Your mother and your brethren [ g ] are standing outside , and they want to see you. ”
NCB	Luke	8	21	But he replied , “ My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice. ” The Progressive Revelation of the Mystery of Jesus
NCB	Luke	8	22	) —will be apostles , who are no longer seeking miracles . Here then is the portrait of Jesus : he brings life to those who approach him with faith .
NCB	Luke	8	23	and as they sailed he fell asleep . Then a windstorm swept down on the lake . As a result , the boat was becoming filled with water , and they were in danger .
NCB	Luke	8	24	So they went to him and awakened him , saying , “ Master ! Master ! We are perishing ! ” Then he awakened and rebuked the wind and the turbulent waves . They subsided and there was calm .
NCB	Luke	8	25	He said to them , “ Where is your faith ? ” They were filled with fear and a sense of awe , and they said to one another , “ Who can this be ? He gives orders to the winds and the water , and they obey him. ”
NCB	Luke	8	26	Jesus Casts Out a Legion of Demons . [ i ] Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee .
NCB	Luke	8	27	As he stepped ashore , he was approached by a man from the town who was possessed by demons . For a long time he had worn no clothes . Moreover , he did not live in a house but among the tombs .
NCB	Luke	8	28	When the man caught sight of Jesus , he cried out and fell at his feet , shouting at the top of his voice , “ What do you want with me , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I implore you , do not torment me ! ”
NCB	Luke	8	29	For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man . Many times in the past it had seized him , and on such occasions they used to restrain him with chains and shackles , but he would manage to break loose and be driven by the demon into the wilds .
NCB	Luke	8	30	Then Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” “ Legion , ” he replied , for many demons had entered him .
NCB	Luke	8	31	And they begged him not to order them to go back into the abyss .
NCB	Luke	8	32	Now on the mountainside a large herd of pigs was feeding , and they pleaded with him to let them go into the pigs . He allowed this .
NCB	Luke	8	33	The demons then came out of the man and entered the pigs . Thereupon the herd charged down the steep bank into the lake and drowned .
NCB	Luke	8	34	When those tending the herd saw what had occurred , they ran off and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside .
NCB	Luke	8	35	As a result , people came out to see what had happened . When they came near Jesus , they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus ’ feet , fully clothed and in his right mind , and they were frightened .
NCB	Luke	8	36	Those who had been eye-witnesses to the incident told how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed .
NCB	Luke	8	37	Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them , for they were seized with great fear . So he got into the boat and went away .
NCB	Luke	8	38	The man from whom the demons had gone out pleaded that he be allowed to go with him , but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
NCB	Luke	8	39	“ Return to your home and give witness to what God has done for you. ” He then departed , proclaiming throughout the town what Jesus had done for him .
NCB	Luke	8	40	Jesus Heals a Woman and Raises a Child . [ j ] When Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , for they had all been waiting for him .
NCB	Luke	8	41	Then a man named Jairus , a leader of the synagogue , came forward . Throwing himself at the feet of Jesus , he pleaded with him to come to his house ,
NCB	Luke	8	42	because he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , who was dying . And as Jesus went forth , the crowds were pressing in on him .
NCB	Luke	8	43	There was a woman who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years , but no one had been able to cure her affliction .
NCB	Luke	8	44	Coming up behind him , she touched the fringe of his cloak , and her bleeding stopped immediately .
NCB	Luke	8	45	Jesus then asked , “ Who was it who touched me ? ” When everyone denied doing so , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are surrounding you and pressing closely upon you. ”
NCB	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me , for I could sense power going out from me. ”
NCB	Luke	8	47	When the woman realized that she had not escaped notice , she came forward , trembling , and knelt down before him . In the presence of all the people , she related why she had touched him and how she had been healed immediately .
NCB	Luke	8	48	Then Jesus said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has healed you . Go in peace. ”
NCB	Luke	8	49	While he was still speaking , someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said , “ Your daughter has died . Do not bother the Teacher any further. ”
NCB	Luke	8	50	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ Do not be afraid . Just have faith , and she will be saved. ”
NCB	Luke	8	51	When he arrived at the house , he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter , John , and James , and the child ’ s father and mother .
NCB	Luke	8	52	Everyone was weeping and mourning for her , but he said , “ Stop your weeping ! She is not dead ; she is asleep. ”
NCB	Luke	8	53	They laughed at him because they knew that she had died .
NCB	Luke	8	54	However , Jesus took her by the hand and called out to her , “ Little child , arise. ”
NCB	Luke	8	55	Her spirit returned , and she stood up at once . Then Jesus directed that she be given something to eat .
NCB	Luke	8	56	Her parents were stunned , but he gave them strict instructions to tell no one what had happened . Footnotes - Luke 8:2 Some women belong to the group of disciples ; this was an occurrence quite rare at that period . As for Mary of Magdala ( Mary Magdalene ) , the expression “ seven demons ” suggests some violent illness with symptoms that were disconcerting for a woman . - Luke 8:4 Since the time of the Prophets , harvesting was a current image of the Judgment ( Joel 4:13 ) . Sowing evokes the activity of Jesus . Jesus knows from experience that preaching the Gospel converts only hearts that are well disposed . Nevertheless , he underlines with optimism the growth of the seed : despite all risks and obstacles , the Word of God will make progress among human beings . - Luke 8:9 At the moment , only the disciples are sensitive to the riches of the Gospel ; the others do not yet have a free heart . See also note on Mt 13:11 . - Luke 8:11 In the meditation of the early communities , the parable of the sower becomes a lesson for the believer . In daily life , in trials , in the pleasures of life , the work of the demon is an obstacle to the Gospel . Jesus knows this . He also knows the generosity of which humans are capable . He puts us on guard but also calls us to make a persevering effort to let our life be transformed by his teachings . - Luke 8:16 Are the mysteries of the kingdom definitively denied to others ( v.
NCB	Luke	9	9	But Herod said , “ John I beheaded . Then who is this about whom I hear such things ? ” And he was anxious to see him .
NCB	Luke	9	1	Calling the Twelve together , Jesus gave them power and authority to cast out all demons and to cure diseases ,
NCB	Luke	9	2	Ki 1:10-12 . - Luke 9:57 Jesus demands an unconditional commitment from those who hesitate . The preaching of the kingdom is of primary urgency . On its account , we are to renounce every possession and free ourselves from even the most sacred human attachments .
NCB	Luke	9	3	He said to them , “ Take nothing for the journey , neither walking staff , nor sack , nor bread , nor money . Nor are you to have a second tunic .
NCB	Luke	9	4	Whatever house you enter , stay there until you depart from that area .
NCB	Luke	9	5	As for those who do not welcome you , when you leave that town shake the dust from your feet in testimony against them. ”
NCB	Luke	9	6	Then they set forth and traveled from village to village , preaching the gospel and curing diseases everywhere . John the Baptist , Herod , and Jesus . [ b ]
NCB	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was taking place , and he was perplexed because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead ,
NCB	Luke	9	8	others that Elijah had appeared , and still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life .
NCB	Luke	9	10	Jesus Feeds Five Thousand Men . [ c ] On their return , the apostles reported to Jesus what they had done . Then he took them along and withdrew privately to a town named Bethsaida .
NCB	Luke	9	11	When the people learned of this , they followed him . Jesus welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God . He also cured those who were in need of healing .
NCB	Luke	9	12	When evening was approaching , the Twelve came to Jesus and said , “ Send the people away now so that they can go to the villages and farms in the area and obtain food and lodging , for we are in a deserted place. ”
NCB	Luke	9	13	He replied , “ Give them something to eat yourselves. ” They said , “ All we have are five loaves and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all these people. ”
NCB	Luke	9	14	For there were present about five thousand men . Then he instructed his disciples , “ Make them sit down in groups of about fifty. ”
NCB	Luke	9	15	They did so and made them sit down .
NCB	Luke	9	16	Taking the five loaves and the two fish , he looked up to heaven and blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to distribute among the people .
NCB	Luke	9	17	They all ate and were satisfied . Then they gathered up what was left over—twelve baskets of fragments .
NCB	Luke	9	18	Peter ’ s Confession That Jesus Is the Christ . [ d ] Once while Jesus was praying by himself , he asked his disciples who were standing close by , “ Who do the people say that I am ? ”
NCB	Luke	9	19	They answered , “ Some say John the Baptist ; others say Elijah ; and still others , that one of the ancient prophets has arisen. ”
NCB	Luke	9	20	“ But you , ” he said to them , “ who do you say that I am ? ” Peter answered him : “ The Christ of God. ”
NCB	Luke	9	21	Thereupon he gave them strict orders and commanded them not to tell this to anyone .
NCB	Luke	9	22	Jesus Predicts His Passion . He then went on to say , “ The Son of Man must endure great suffering , be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be put to death , and on the third day be raised. ”
NCB	Luke	9	23	The Conditions of Discipleship . [ e ] Then he said to all who were with him , “ Anyone who wishes to follow me must deny himself , take up his cross daily , and follow me .
NCB	Luke	9	24	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it .
NCB	Luke	9	25	What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself ?
NCB	Luke	9	26	“ If anyone is ashamed of me and of my words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
NCB	Luke	9	27	Truly I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Luke	9	28	Jesus Is Transfigured . [ f ] About eight days after he had said this , Jesus took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray .
NCB	Luke	9	29	And while he was praying , the appearance of his face underwent a change , and his clothing became dazzling white .
NCB	Luke	9	30	Suddenly , there were two men talking with him , Moses and Elijah ,
NCB	Luke	9	31	who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure , which would come to pass in Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	9	32	Peter and his companions were very sleepy , but when they became fully awake they beheld his glory and the two men standing beside him .
NCB	Luke	9	33	When they were ready to leave , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good for us to be here . Let us make three tents—one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ” But he did not truly know what he was saying .
NCB	Luke	9	34	While he was speaking , a cloud came and cast its shadow over them , and the three disciples became frightened as they entered the cloud .
NCB	Luke	9	35	Then a voice came out of the cloud , saying , “ This is my Son , my Chosen One . [ g ] Listen to him. ”
NCB	Luke	9	36	After the voice had spoken , they beheld only Jesus . They kept silent and at that time they did not tell anyone about what they had witnessed . End of the Galilean Ministry
NCB	Luke	9	37	Jesus Heals a Boy with a Demon . [ h ] On the following day , when they descended from the mountain , a large crowd came forth to meet him .
NCB	Luke	9	38	Then , suddenly , a man in the crowd cried out , “ Teacher , I implore you to look at my son . He is my only child .
NCB	Luke	9	39	A spirit seizes him and with a shriek suddenly throws him into convulsions until he begins to foam at the mouth . It hardly ever leaves him , continuously torturing him .
NCB	Luke	9	40	I begged your disciples to drive it out , but they were unable to do so. ”
NCB	Luke	9	41	Jesus said in reply , “ O unbelieving and perverse generation ! How much longer shall I remain with you and have to endure you ? Bring your son here ! ”
NCB	Luke	9	42	As the boy was approaching him , the demon threw him into convulsions . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , cured the boy , and gave him back to his father .
NCB	Luke	9	43	And all those present were awestruck at the greatness of God . Jesus Predicts His Passion a Second Time . [ i ] Amid the astonishment of the crowds at everything he was doing , Jesus said to his disciples ,
NCB	Luke	9	44	“ Listen carefully to these words . The Son of Man is going to be handed over into the power of men. ”
NCB	Luke	9	45	But they did not understand what he was saying . Its meaning was hidden from them so that they could not comprehend his message , and they were afraid to ask him what he meant .
NCB	Luke	9	46	True Greatness . [ j ] The disciples then began to argue about which of them was the greatest .
NCB	Luke	9	47	Jesus , aware of their inner thoughts , took a child , placed him by his side ,
NCB	Luke	9	48	and said to them , “ Whoever receives this child in my name receives me ; and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me . For the one who is least among all of you is the one who is the greatest. ”
NCB	Luke	9	49	Whoever Is Not against You Is with You . [ k ] John then said , “ Master , we saw someone expelling demons in your name , and we forbade him because he is not with us. ”
NCB	Luke	9	50	Jesus replied , “ Do not hinder him ! For whoever is not against you is with you. ” The Journey to Jerusalem [ l ] The Departure
NCB	Luke	9	51	Passing through Samaria . [ m ] As the time drew near for him to be taken up , Jesus resolutely set his sights on Jerusalem ,
NCB	Luke	9	52	and he sent messengers ahead of him . They entered a Samaritan village to make arrangements for his arrival ,
NCB	Luke	9	53	but the people there would not receive him because his destination was Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	9	54	When the disciples James and John saw this , they asked , “ Lord , do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them ? ” [ n ]
NCB	Luke	9	55	) ; some manuscripts have : “ And he said , ‘ You do not know what kind of spirit you are of , for the Son of Man did not come to destroy lives , but to save them. ’ ” - Luke 9:54 An allusion to
NCB	Luke	9	56	Then they journeyed forth to another village .
NCB	Luke	9	57	The Cost of Following Jesus . [ o ] As they traveled along the road , a man said to him , “ I will follow you wherever you go. ”
NCB	Luke	9	58	Jesus told him , “ Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. ”
NCB	Luke	9	59	To another he said , “ Follow me. ” The man replied , “ Lord , allow me to go first and bury my father. ”
NCB	Luke	9	60	Jesus said to him , “ Let the dead bury their own dead . You are to go and proclaim the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Luke	9	61	Another man said , “ I will follow you , Lord , but allow me first to say farewell to my family at home. ”
NCB	Luke	9	62	Jesus said to him , “ No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God. ” Footnotes - Luke 9:1 The Twelve are to share the mission of Jesus , to announce and attest the coming of salvation . Like their Lord , the apostles of the kingdom must be disinterested and conscious of the grave importance of the Gospel . They will accept hospitality simply and without consideration of personal interest . It is by clearly dissociating themselves from incredulity that they will announce the judgment that is coming ( see Acts 13:51 ; 18:5 ) . - Luke 9:7 People speak of the return of Elijah as a precursor of the day of the Lord ( Mal 3:23 ) . They have known John . Now Jesus ’ renown reaches the palace of the prince whom he will encounter in the course of his Passion ( see Lk 23:7-12 ) . The murderer of John evinces an idle curiosity . The action of Jesus compels each of us to ask ourselves : What do we say of Jesus ? - Luke 9:10 The preaching of Jesus so excites the crowd that they go so far as to disturb him in his retreat . He receives them and speaks to them about the kingdom of God . The miracle of the loaves is like a renewal of the prodigy of the manna expected at the time of the Messiah . In this account , Christians already discern the signs of the Eucharist : God nourishes his people . See also notes on Mt 14:13-21 ; 14:19 ; and 14:21 ; and Mk 6:43 . - Luke 9:18 At the opening of this passage , Jesus is found in prayer—thus Luke underlines the importance of the moment . Christ invites the Twelve to declare themselves concerning who he is . Peter precedes the others—in the Gospel , Peter ’ s faith has a large role ( see Lk 22:31-33 ) —in acknowledging Christ as God , that is , as the expected Messiah whose unity with God is astonishing . In order to avoid all ambiguity about himself , Jesus recommends secrecy and for the first time announces his Passion . Contrary to what people expect , the Messiah will not save his people by a popular or political uprising but by his Death and Resurrection . The title “ Son of Man ” suggests the Passion and announces a glorious coming on the last day . - Luke 9:23 To believe in Christ is to strive to share the mystery of his Death and Resurrection . To do so it is necessary for each of us to go beyond ourselves and our egoism in the ordinary conditions of life . See the kingdom of God : this expression evokes the appearances of the risen Lord or the work of the Spirit in the primitive Church . - Luke 9:28 In a vision on a mountain , three disciples behold , for one instant , the divine splendor of Jesus . Moses and Elijah , who announced God ’ s plan in the Law and the Prophets , attest that it will now be accomplished by the Passion , that “ passage ” of Jesus , which is the new “ Exodus. ” As formerly in the Exodus God manifested himself in the cloud , now through the one he designates as his Son , his Chosen One ( see Isa 42:1 ; 49:7 ) , he will give to all people the definitive liberation . The evangelist hardly explains the unfolding of this mysterious event . He gives us the shattering experience of Jesus ’ inner life to prompt our faith in Christ : to hear this man is to hear God . - Luke 9:35 My Chosen One : this is similar to a Palestinian Jewish title found in the literature of the Dead Sea Scrolls and to Isa 42:1 . - Luke 9:37 Returning to the people , Jesus resumes the struggle . In contrast with the lapse of the disciples , the Messiah manifests his sovereign power against all the forces that enchain us , of which the person afflicted with a demon is a striking example . - Luke 9:43 Amid popular success , Jesus keeps his eyes fixed on his Passion , the decisive act of salvation . For the believers , as for the disciples , it remains difficult to accept the necessity of the cross . - Luke 9:46 As a result of their lack of pretense , children are the beloved of God and become models for the believer ( see Lk 18:15-17 ) . We must share this regard of Christ for the little ones , even in the way of thinking and living . - Luke 9:49 It is necessary to accept the initiative of all those who make use of the name of Christ . - Luke 9:51 We are at a crossroads in the life of Christ : Jesus begins to go to Jerusalem where his mystery is to be accomplished . This journey will take him from Galilee to the Holy City . In this section , Luke brings together a part of the teaching of Jesus that the other evangelists do not have or that they give in very different contexts . In these ten chapters , we find some of the most moving words of Christ about the mercy of God . - Luke 9:51 The Samaritans refused passage to Jewish pilgrims on their way to the temple in Jerusalem , because they did not give recognition to that sanctuary . The critical text says simply that Jesus “ rebuked ” the disciples ( v.
NCB	Luke	10	10	) . In this passage , Luke brings together various recommendations of Jesus in order to draw up a program for the missionaries . - Luke 10:12 That day : the day of judgment . - Luke 10:13 See note on Mt 11:20-24 . - Luke 10:15 The netherworld : the place of the dead , i.e. , the underworld ( as in Acts 2:27 ,
NCB	Luke	10	1	After this , the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended to visit .
NCB	Luke	10	2	He said to them : “ The harvest is abundant , but the laborers are few . Therefore , ask the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers for his harvest .
NCB	Luke	10	3	“ Go on your way . Behold , I am sending you out like lambs among wolves .
NCB	Luke	10	4	Carry no money bag or sack and wear no sandals . Greet no one on the road .
NCB	Luke	10	5	Whatever house you enter , let your first words be , ‘ Peace to this house ! ’
NCB	Luke	10	6	If a man of peace lives there , your peace will rest on him ; if not , it will return to you .
NCB	Luke	10	7	“ Remain in the same house , and eat and drink whatever is offered to you , for the laborer deserves his wages . Do not move around from house to house .
NCB	Luke	10	8	Whenever you enter a town and its people welcome you , eat whatever is set before you .
NCB	Luke	10	9	Cure the sick who are there , and say , ‘ The kingdom of God has come unto you. ’
NCB	Luke	10	11	‘ Even the dust of your town that clings to us we wipe off our feet as a sign against you . Yet know this : the kingdom of God is at hand. ’
NCB	Luke	10	12	I tell you , on that day [ b ] it will be more bearable for Sodom than for that town .
NCB	Luke	10	13	Woe to the Cities of Galilee . [ c ] “ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! If the mighty deeds performed in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have come to repentance long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
NCB	Luke	10	14	But at the judgment it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon than for you .
NCB	Luke	10	15	And as for you , Capernaum : Will you be exalted to heaven ? You will be brought down to the netherworld . [ d ]
NCB	Luke	10	16	“ Whoever listens to you listens to me , and whoever rejects you rejects me . And whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me. ”
NCB	Luke	10	17	Joy of the Missionaries . [ e ] The seventy-two returned rejoicing , and they said , “ Lord , in your name even the demons are subject to us. ”
NCB	Luke	10	18	He said to them , “ I watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning .
NCB	Luke	10	19	Behold , I have given you the power to tread upon snakes and scorpions and all the forces of the enemy , and nothing will ever harm you .
NCB	Luke	10	20	Nevertheless , do not rejoice in the knowledge that the spirits are subject to you . Rejoice rather that your names are inscribed in heaven. ”
NCB	Luke	10	21	Joy of Jesus . [ f ] At that very hour , Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said , “ I thank you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned and have revealed them to children . Yes , Father , such has been your gracious will .
NCB	Luke	10	22	“ All things have been entrusted to me by my Father . No one knows who the Son is except the Father , or who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son wishes to reveal him. ”
NCB	Luke	10	23	The Privilege of Discipleship . Then he turned to his disciples and said privately , “ Blessed are the eyes that see what you see .
NCB	Luke	10	24	I tell you , many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. ”
NCB	Luke	10	25	The Greatest Commandment . [ g ] And behold , a lawyer came forward to test Jesus by asking , “ Teacher , what must I do to gain eternal life ? ”
NCB	Luke	10	26	Jesus said to him , “ What is written in the Law ? How do you read it ? ”
NCB	Luke	10	27	He answered , “ You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your strength , and with all your mind , and your neighbor as yourself. ”
NCB	Luke	10	28	Jesus then said to him , “ You have answered correctly . Do this and you will live. ”
NCB	Luke	10	29	The Parable of the Good Samaritan . But because the man wished to justify himself , he asked , “ And who is my neighbor ? ”
NCB	Luke	10	30	Jesus replied , “ A man was going down [ h ] from Jerusalem to Jericho , when he was attacked by robbers . They stripped him and beat him , and then went off leaving him half-dead .
NCB	Luke	10	31	) . - Luke 10:17 In the joy of the disciples , Jesus sees the beginning of the defeat of the forces of evil inflamed against human beings , and of their leader Satan ( see Lk 11:20 ) . Jesus shares their joy ; but he invites them to rejoice most of all that they are the elect of the Father , a happiness that radically surpasses all missionary success . - Luke 10:21 In this inspired prayer , Jesus lays bare the profound movement of his heart and the very mystery of his person . He is gripped by the revelation made to the poor ( i.e. , children ) ; he lives , in an inexpressible fashion , in unity with the Father in the Spirit . The expectation of kings and prophets , i.e. , of the Old Testament , is now accomplished , for Jesus is here and shares with human beings God ’ s mysterious presence . The Church knows that by herself she is nothing in this world , but she is astounded to bring forth for all people this great revelation of God . This text constantly brings her back home to the heart of the Gospel . - Luke 10:25 Jesus gives pride of place in his teaching to the commandment of love , which sums up the entire Law ( see Mt 22:40 ) ; but love of God and love of neighbor are henceforth joined inseparably . - Luke 10:30 Going down : Jericho lies in the deepest depression on earth , at
NCB	Luke	10	32	A Levite [ i ] likewise came to that spot and saw him , but he too passed by on the other side .
NCB	Luke	10	33	“ But a Samaritan who was traveling along that road came upon him , and when he saw him he was moved with compassion .
NCB	Luke	10	34	He went up to him and bandaged his wounds after having poured oil and wine on them . Then he brought him upon his own animal to an inn and looked after him .
NCB	Luke	10	35	“ The next day , he took out two denarii [ j ] and gave them to the innkeeper , saying , ‘ Look after him , and when I return I will repay you for anything more you might spend. ’
NCB	Luke	10	36	“ Which of those three , do you think , was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers ? ”
NCB	Luke	10	37	He answered , “ The one who showed him mercy. ” Jesus said to him , “ Go and do likewise. ” [ k ]
NCB	Luke	10	38	Martha and Mary . [ l ] In the course of their journey , he came to a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home .
NCB	Luke	10	39	She had a sister named Mary who sat at the Lord ’ s feet and listened to what he was saying .
NCB	Luke	10	40	But Martha was distracted by her many tasks . So she came to him and said , “ Lord , do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself ? Tell her to come and help me. ”
NCB	Luke	10	41	The Lord answered her : “ Martha , Martha , you are anxious and upset about many things ,
NCB	Luke	10	42	when only one thing is necessary . Mary has chosen the better part , and it will not be taken away from her. ” Footnotes - Luke 10:1 The number of those sent suggests universality , since the ancient leaders of Israel traditionally numbered seventy-two ( see Num 11:24-29 ) , and seventy-two pagan nations were listed ( see Gen
NCB	Luke	10	800	feet below sea level . - Luke 10:32 Levite : a minister of the temple . - Luke 10:35 Denarii : plural for denarius , a laborer ’ s daily wage . - Luke 10:37 The scribe had asked who was his neighbor . Jesus responds with the example of the Samaritan who , without regard for national rancors and religious disputes , recognizes the neighbor in an unknown person who is in need of help . Hence , the person who loves will know immediately how to individualize who his neighbor is . It is not necessarily—as the Jews thought—a person of the same nation , race , or religion . - Luke 10:38 The incident is intended to teach that the disciples of Jesus must not allow secondary things to take precedence over essentials , namely , the hearing of the Word of God in order to feed on it and put it into practice ( see Lk 6:47 ; 8:21 ; 11:28 ; Acts 6:2 ) . The village in which the two sisters lived was Bethany . Like the preceding parable , this thoughtful incident is told only in Luke .

NCB	Luke	11	3	) . - Luke 11:33 Luke here brings together two sentences that have a theme of the lamp . It is a call to throw off blindness and be open to the light that is Jesus ( see Lk 8:16 ) . The light of faith transforms one ’ s life . - Luke 11:37 In Luke these strong rebukes seem to have been given by Jesus in private conversations with Pharisees and scribes , whereas in Matthew ( 23:13ff ) the charges are uttered publicly in the presence of outsiders . This is a further aspect of the “ gentleness of Christ , ” which Luke means to communicate . - Luke 11:38 Had not first washed : this referred to the ceremonial washing , which was part of the “ oral ” traditions of the Pharisees , i.e. , practices and regulations meant to fill out the written Law of Moses ( see Mt 15:9 ; Mk 7:3 , and note on Mk 7:4 ) . - Luke 11:42 Tithes : see note on Mt 23:23-24 . - Luke 11:44 Like unmarked graves : as Passover drew near , Jews used to whitewash tombs in order to avoid touching them inadvertently , which would have caused a legal uncleanness ( see Num 19:16 ) . - Luke 11:51 Abel . . .

NCB	Luke	11	5	He also said to them , “ Suppose one of you has a friend , and he goes to him at midnight and says : ‘ My friend , lend me three loaves of bread ,
NCB	Luke	11	6	for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey , and I have nothing to offer him , ’
NCB	Luke	11	7	and the friend answers from inside : ‘ Do not bother me . The door is already locked , and my children and I are in bed ; I can not get up now to give you anything. ’
NCB	Luke	11	8	I tell you : even though he will not get up and give it to him because of their friendship , he will get up and give him whatever he needs because of his persistence . Ask , Seek , Knock .
NCB	Luke	11	9	“ Therefore , I say to you : ask , and it will be given you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and the door will be opened to you .
NCB	Luke	11	10	For everyone who asks will receive , and those who seek will find , and to those who knock the door will be opened .
NCB	Luke	11	12	or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg ?
NCB	Luke	11	13	If you , then , despite your evil nature , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ! ” For or against Jesus [ c ]
NCB	Luke	11	14	Jesus and Beelzebul . [ d ] Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute , and when the demon had gone out , the man who was mute spoke , and the crowd was amazed .
NCB	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , “ He casts out demons by Beelzebul , the prince of demons. ”
NCB	Luke	11	16	Others , to test him , demanded a sign from heaven .
NCB	Luke	11	17	However , he knew what they were thinking , and he said to them , “ Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste , and a house divided against itself will collapse .
NCB	Luke	11	18	If Satan is divided against himself , how can his kingdom stand ? “ For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul .
NCB	Luke	11	19	Now , if it is by Beelzebul that I cast out demons , by whom do your own children cast them out ? Therefore , they will be your judges .
NCB	Luke	11	20	But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons , then the kingdom of God has come to you .
NCB	Luke	11	21	“ When a strong man is fully armed and guards his palace , his possessions are safe .
NCB	Luke	11	22	But when someone who is stronger than he is attacks and overpowers him , he carries off all the weapons upon which the owner relied and distributes the plunder .
NCB	Luke	11	23	No Compromise. “ Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .
NCB	Luke	11	24	New Offensive from the Evil Spirit. “ When an unclean spirit goes out of a person , it wanders through waterless regions seeking a place to rest , and if it finds none it says , ‘ I will return to the home from which I departed. ’
NCB	Luke	11	25	However , when it returns , it finds that home swept and put in order .
NCB	Luke	11	26	Then it goes off and brings back seven other spirits more wicked than itself , and they enter and settle there . As a result , the plight of that person is worse than before. ”
NCB	Luke	11	27	True Blessedness . [ e ] While he was speaking , a woman in the crowd called out to him and said , “ Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you ! ”
NCB	Luke	11	28	Jesus replied , “ Blessed , rather , are those who hear the word of God and obey it ! ”
NCB	Luke	11	29	The Sign of Jonah . [ f ] As the crowd continued to increase in number , Jesus said to them , “ This is an evil generation . It asks for a sign , but the only sign it will be given is the sign of Jonah .
NCB	Luke	11	30	For just as Jonah became a sign to the inhabitants of Nineveh , so will the Son of Man be to this generation .
NCB	Luke	11	31	“ On the day of judgment the queen of the south will rise up with the men of this generation and condemn them , because she came from the farthest reaches of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and now one greater than Solomon is here .
NCB	Luke	11	32	On the day of judgment , the men of Nineveh will rise up with this generation and condemn it , because they repented at the preaching of Jonah , and now one greater than Jonah is here .
NCB	Luke	11	33	The Parable of the Lighted Lamp . [ g ] “ No one lights a lamp and then puts it in a cellar or under a basket ; rather , he places it upon a lampstand so that people may see the light when they come in .
NCB	Luke	11	34	The Lamp of the Body. “ Your eyes are the lamp of your body . If your eyes are sound , your whole body will be filled with light . However , if your eyes are diseased , your whole body will be in darkness .
NCB	Luke	11	35	See to it then that the light inside you is not darkness .
NCB	Luke	11	36	Therefore , if your whole body is full of light , with no part of it in darkness , it will be as full of light as when a lamp illuminates you with its rays. ”
NCB	Luke	11	37	Woe to the Scribes and Pharisees . [ h ] When he had finished speaking , a Pharisee invited him to dine at his house . He went in and took his place at table .
NCB	Luke	11	38	The Pharisee was surprised to see that he had not first washed [ i ] before the meal .
NCB	Luke	11	39	But the Lord said to him , “ You Pharisees cleanse the outside of a cup and dish , but you leave the inside full of greed and wickedness .
NCB	Luke	11	40	You fools ! Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside ?
NCB	Luke	11	41	Let what is inside be given as alms to the poor , and everything will be clean for you .
NCB	Luke	11	42	“ Woe to you Pharisees ! You pay tithes [ j ] of mint and rue and every garden herb , but you neglect justice and the love of God . You should have practiced these without neglecting the others .
NCB	Luke	11	43	“ Woe to you Pharisees ! You love to have the best seats in synagogues and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces .
NCB	Luke	11	44	“ Woe to you ! For you are like unmarked graves [ k ] upon which people tread without realizing it. ”
NCB	Luke	11	45	On hearing this , one of the lawyers said , “ Teacher when you say such things you are insulting us too. ”
NCB	Luke	11	46	He replied , “ Woe also to you lawyers ! For you impose burdens on people that are difficult to bear , but you yourselves do not lift a finger to be of assistance .
NCB	Luke	11	47	“ Woe to you ! For you build the tombs of the Prophets whom your ancestors murdered .
NCB	Luke	11	48	By acting in this way you bear witness to and approve of what your ancestors did . They killed the Prophets , and you build their tombs .
NCB	Luke	11	49	“ That is why the Wisdom of God said , ‘ I will send them Prophets and apostles , some of whom they will kill and persecute , ’
NCB	Luke	11	50	so that this generation may be charged with the responsibility for the blood of all the Prophets shed since the foundation of the world ,
NCB	Luke	11	51	from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah [ l ] who perished between the altar and the sanctuary . Yes , I tell you , this generation will have to answer for it all .
NCB	Luke	11	52	“ Woe to you lawyers ! For you have taken away the key of knowledge . You yourselves did not enter , and you blocked those from entering who were trying to go in. ”
NCB	Luke	11	53	When he left the house , the scribes and the Pharisees were extremely hostile and they began to interrogate him about many things ,
NCB	Luke	11	54	hoping to trap him in something he might say in reply . Footnotes - Luke 11:1 In the eyes of Luke , the prayer of the disciples is connected to the prayer of Jesus himself . It is a profession of faith in which the community says the essence of what it requests : the kingdom of God , daily sustenance , forgiveness , and strength in time of trial . The form of the Our Father given here is shorter than the one handed down in the Gospel of Matthew . - Luke 11:5 In the Palestine of that time , people went to bed early ; moreover , the entire family slept in a single room , and the door was secured from inside with a heavy bar . Thus , awakening a neighbor caused a great deal of inconvenience , but the latter would be ashamed to remain insensitive . And since God is mercy itself , could he refuse the request of believers when it concerns essentials ( see Lk 18:1-8 ; 22:44 ) ? - Luke 11:14 The suspicion with which his adversaries regard Jesus becomes accusation and snare ; they treat him as an agent of Satan and demand signs of him . In this confrontation that is more and more manifest , Jesus does not soften his message in any way ; rather he demands that one choose for or against him . The time of waiting is over ; the time of decision is at hand . - Luke 11:14 There are groups who claim to cast out demons—the word “ children ” designates the members or disciples of a group . Why then should his opponents be suspicious of Jesus , especially since he actually heals sicknesses ? The miracles that he works manifest the power of God , for in order to conquer Satan who is reputedly at work in sicknesses one must be stronger than he is . - Luke 11:27 The happiness of the kingdom of God is open to those who accept the Word of Jesus . This is a warning to adversaries who reject it . Thus , the true grandeur of Mary is not in having given Jesus his body but in having welcomed the message ( see Lk 1:38 ; 8:21 ) . - Luke 11:29 Many long for prodigies that would forcibly remove the need for faith . Their desire is vain . The true sign that attests the mission of Jesus is the totality of his work and the force of his person as well as his call to conversion . Thus , past generations had seen messages for them in the wisdom of Solomon ( see
NCB	Luke	12	12	When the time comes , the Holy Spirit will teach you what you are to say. ” Be Poor in Order To Be Free
NCB	Luke	12	1	Meanwhile a crowd of many thousands of people had gathered , and they were so tightly packed together that they were trampling on each other . Then Jesus began to speak , saying first to his disciples : “ Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees—which is their hypocrisy .
NCB	Luke	12	2	There is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed , and nothing secret that will not become known .
NCB	Luke	12	3	Therefore , whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight , and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops . Courage in Time of Persecution .
NCB	Luke	12	4	“ I tell you , my friends , have no fear of those who kill the body and after that can do nothing further .
NCB	Luke	12	5	But I will tell you whom to fear . Be afraid of the one who , after he has killed , has the authority to cast into Gehenna . I tell you , fear him !
NCB	Luke	12	6	“ Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies ? And yet not one of them is forgotten in God ’ s sight .
NCB	Luke	12	7	Even the hairs on your head have all been counted . Do not be afraid . You are worth far more than any number of sparrows .
NCB	Luke	12	8	“ I tell you this : whoever acknowledges me before men , the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God .
NCB	Luke	12	9	But whoever denies me before men , he will be denied before the angels of God .

NCB	Luke	12	11	When you are brought before synagogues and rulers and authorities , do not be concerned about how or what you are to answer or what you are to say .
NCB	Luke	12	13	A Saying about Greed . [ c ] Someone in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , tell my brother to share the family inheritance with me. ”
NCB	Luke	12	14	Jesus answered him , “ Friend , who appointed me to be a judge and arbitrator in your regard ? ”
NCB	Luke	12	15	[ d ] After this , he said to the crowd , “ Take care to be on your guard against all kinds of greed . Life does not depend upon an abundance of one ’ s possessions. ”
NCB	Luke	12	16	The Parable of the Rich Fool . Then he told them a parable : “ There was a wealthy man whose land yielded an abundant harvest .
NCB	Luke	12	17	He thought to himself , ‘ What shall I do , for I do not have sufficient space to store my crops ? ’
NCB	Luke	12	18	Then he said , ‘ This is what I will do . I will pull down my barns and build larger ones , where I will store my grain and other produce ,
NCB	Luke	12	19	) and also to the Passion that is to cleanse the people of their sins ( see Mk 10:38 ) . - Luke 12:51 The Gospel brings not security but the division ( see Lk 2:34-35 ) that , according to Micah ( 7:6 ) , is a prelude to the last times . - Luke 12:54 Understanding the signs of the times means recognizing the time of salvation , the time of Jesus . No concern is more important than this , for one ’ s very salvation is in question . - Luke 12:57 One must put one ’ s life in order before the judgment , for afterward it will be too late . We are urged to settle disputes quickly in accord with Gospel values . Matthew will turn this text into an inducement to fraternal charity ( Mt 5:25-26 ) .
NCB	Luke	12	20	“ But God said to him , ‘ You fool ! This very night your life will be required of you . And who then will get to enjoy the fruit of your labors ? ’
NCB	Luke	12	21	That is how it will be for the one who stores up treasure for himself yet fails to become rich in the sight of God. ”
NCB	Luke	12	22	Trust in God . [ e ] Then he said to his disciples , “ Therefore , heed my words . Do not be concerned about your life and what you will have to eat , or about your body and what you will wear .
NCB	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food , and the body is more than clothing .
NCB	Luke	12	24	“ Consider the ravens . They do not sow or reap , they have no storehouse or barn , and yet God feeds them . You are of far greater importance than birds .
NCB	Luke	12	25	Can any of you through worrying add a single moment to your span of life ?
NCB	Luke	12	26	If then such a small thing is beyond your power , why should you be concerned about the rest ?
NCB	Luke	12	27	“ Consider the lilies and how they grow . They neither labor nor spin . Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his royal splendor was clothed like one of these .
NCB	Luke	12	28	If God so clothes the grass that grows today in the field and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow , how much more will he clothe you , O you of little faith !
NCB	Luke	12	29	“ Hence , do not be greatly concerned about what you are to eat and what you are to drink . Do not worry .
NCB	Luke	12	30	The nations of the world are concerned for all these things . Your Father is aware of your needs .
NCB	Luke	12	31	Rather , seek his kingdom , and these things will be given to you as well .
NCB	Luke	12	32	Treasure in Heaven . [ f ] “ Fear not , little flock , for your Father has chosen to give you the kingdom .
NCB	Luke	12	33	Sell your possessions and give to those in need . Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out , an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can come near and no moth can destroy .
NCB	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart also be . Parables about Watchfulness [ g ]
NCB	Luke	12	35	The Parable of the Vigilant Steward . [ h ] “ Fasten your belts for service and have your lamps lit .
NCB	Luke	12	36	Be like servants who are waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet , so that they may open the door as soon as he comes and knocks .
NCB	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants whom the master finds awake when he arrives . Amen , I say to you , he will fasten his belt , have them recline to eat , and proceed to wait on them himself .
NCB	Luke	12	38	If he comes in the second watch [ i ] or in the third and finds them still awake , blessed are those servants .
NCB	Luke	12	39	The Hour of the Son of Man . [ j ] “ But keep this in mind : if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming , he would not have left his house to be broken into .
NCB	Luke	12	40	So you must also be prepared , because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. ”
NCB	Luke	12	41	The Parable of the Faithful Servant . [ k ] Then Peter asked , “ Lord , are you directing this parable to us or do you mean it for everyone ? ”
NCB	Luke	12	42	The Lord replied , “ Who then is the faithful and wise steward whom his master will put in charge of his household to give its members their allotment of food at the proper time ?
NCB	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant if his master finds him doing so when he arrives home .
NCB	Luke	12	44	Truly I tell you , he will put him in charge of all his property .
NCB	Luke	12	45	“ But if that servant says to himself , ‘ My master is detained in arriving , ’ and he proceeds to beat the menservants and the maids , and to eat and drink and get drunk ,
NCB	Luke	12	46	the master of that servant will return on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know . He will punish him and assign him a place with the unfaithful .
NCB	Luke	12	47	“ The servant who knew his master ’ s wishes but did not get ready or do what his master wanted will receive a severe beating .
NCB	Luke	12	48	But the one who did not know those wishes , and who acted in such a manner as to deserve a beating , will be beaten less severely . Much will be demanded of a person to whom much has been given , and even more will be asked of a person to whom more has been entrusted . The Urgency of Making the Decision
NCB	Luke	12	49	Jesus and His Passion . [ l ] “ I have come to spread fire on the earth , and how I wish it were already blazing !

NCB	Luke	12	51	Jesus , Cause of Dissensions . [ m ] “ Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division .
NCB	Luke	12	52	“ From now on a household of five will be divided , three against two and two against three ;
NCB	Luke	12	53	they will be divided , father against son and son against father , mother against daughter and daughter against mother , mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law. ”
NCB	Luke	12	54	Discerning the Signs of the Times . [ n ] He also said to the crowds , “ When you see a cloud rising in the west , you immediately say , ‘ It is going to rain , ’ and so it happens .
NCB	Luke	12	55	And when you see the wind blowing from the south , you say , ‘ It is going to be hot , ’ and so it happens .
NCB	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky . Why then do you not know how to interpret the present time ?
NCB	Luke	12	57	Reconciling with Others before the Judgment . [ o ] “ And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right ?
NCB	Luke	12	58	Thus , when you are going to court with your opponent , make an effort to settle the matter with him on the way . If you fail to do so , he may drag you before the judge , and the judge will hand you over to the officer , and the officer will throw you into prison .
NCB	Luke	12	59	I tell you , you will not be given your freedom until you have paid your debt down to the very last penny. ” Footnotes - Luke 12:1 True disciples do not let the message become altered and are not afraid to bear clear witness to the Gospel , to confess their faith in Jesus . Persecutions should not intimidate them ; indeed , it is better to be condemned by opinion than to lose God . Believers are certain that the Lord will never abandon them ; they rely on the help of the Spirit to proclaim simply and without alteration the essence of the message ( see Acts 4:8 ; 5:12 ; 7:55 ) . - Luke 12:10 Everyone who speaks . . . against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven : the meaning of this verse is obscure . Perhaps the meaning is that when Jesus was alive , people could be excused from failing to recognize him as the Savior , but such an excuse will no longer be possible once his mission has been confirmed by the power of the Spirit at Pentecost . - Luke 12:13 The Law of Moses dealt with temporal questions ( see Ex 2:14 ; Acts 7:27 ) , and the rabbis willingly offered their opinions . Jesus has not come to sustain us in our personal interests but to save us . The Gospel does not foster greed in any form ; it demands detachment from earthly goods . This episode serves as an introduction to a series of teachings concerning money , an important theme for the Gospel of Luke . - Luke 12:15 The desire for and the satisfaction in accumulating riches closes one to God and deprives one of lucidity . The goods of earth do not have a vocation for eternity . The spiritual future of human beings is more important . The Word and Life of Jesus are sustained by this conviction . - Luke 12:22 When the concern for earthly goods rules one ’ s whole life , and even one ’ s prayer , we have become enslaved to them . Christ ’ s disciples remain free : they trust in God . Jesus does not preach unconcern but concern for what is essential : to accept the kingdom and to live the Gospel . - Luke 12:32 This recommendation to be detached from one ’ s goods and to give them to those in need is more pressing in Luke . The true treasure of the kingdom is to be detached from money . - Luke 12:35 The Jews were wont to ask : “ When will the kingdom come ? ” Christians asked : “ When will the Lord return ? ” When forced to be vigilant , attention inevitably wanes . But the Lord is near , and our life is with him ; we must not be sleeping when he returns . - Luke 12:35 Vigilant servants are bound to work and to be ready even into the night . The disciples are to be focused on meeting their Lord , who will be their joy . - Luke 12:38 Second watch : i.e. , between 9:00 P.M. and midnight . Third : i.e. , between midnight and 3:00 A.M. See note on Mt 14:25 . - Luke 12:39 See note on Mt 24:45-51 . - Luke 12:41 When Peter poses this question , he is answered by a parable summoning all leaders of the community to faithful vigilance . - Luke 12:49 The allusion is to the baptism in fire and the Spirit that begins on Pentecost ( see Lk 3:16 ; Acts 2:3 ,
NCB	Luke	13	13	Then he laid his hands on her , and immediately she stood up straight and began praising God .
NCB	Luke	13	1	At that time , some people who were present told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices .
NCB	Luke	13	2	He asked them , “ Do you think that because the Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans ?
NCB	Luke	13	3	No , I tell you . But unless you repent , you will all perish as they did .
NCB	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen people who were killed when the tower fell on them at Siloam—do you think that they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem ?
NCB	Luke	13	5	No , I tell you—but unless you repent , you will all perish as they did. ” The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree . [ b ]
NCB	Luke	13	6	Then he told them this parable : “ A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard , but whenever he came looking for fruit on it , he found none .
NCB	Luke	13	7	Therefore , he said to his vinedresser , ‘ For three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and have never found any . Cut it down ! Why should it continue to use up the soil ? ’
NCB	Luke	13	8	But the vinedresser replied , ‘ Sir , let it alone for one more year while I dig around it and fertilize it .
NCB	Luke	13	9	Perhaps it will bear fruit next year . If so , well and good . If not , then you can cut it down. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	13	10	Jesus Heals a Woman on the Sabbath . [ c ] On one Sabbath as Jesus was teaching in the synagogue ,
NCB	Luke	13	11	a woman was present , possessed by a spirit that had crippled her for eighteen years . She was bent over and completely unable to stand up straight .
NCB	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , he called her forward and said , “ Woman , you are freed from your infirmity. ”
NCB	Luke	13	14	But the leader of the synagogue was indignant because Jesus had effected a cure on the Sabbath , and he said to the assembled people , “ There are six days when work is permitted . Come on those days and be cured , and not on the Sabbath. ”
NCB	Luke	13	15	The Lord said to him in reply , “ You hypocrites ! Is there a single one of you who does not untie his ox or his donkey and lead it from its stall to give it water on the Sabbath ?
NCB	Luke	13	16	Should not this woman , a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has held bound for eighteen long years , be set free from this bondage on the Sabbath ? ”
NCB	Luke	13	17	At these words , all his adversaries were put to shame , and the people rejoiced at all the wonderful things he was doing .
NCB	Luke	13	18	The Parable of the Mustard Seed . [ d ] He went on to say , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? To what shall I compare it ?
NCB	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden . It grew and became a tree , and the birds of the air made nests in its branches. ”
NCB	Luke	13	20	The Parable of the Yeast . Again he said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
NCB	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until it was completely leavened. ” The Destiny of Israel
NCB	Luke	13	22	Who Will Enter into the Kingdom of God ? [ e ] Jesus continued journeying through towns and villages , teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	13	23	Someone asked him , “ Lord , will only a few be saved ? ” He answered ,
NCB	Luke	13	24	“ Strive to enter through the narrow door , for many , I tell you , will try to enter but will not succeed in doing so .
NCB	Luke	13	25	“ When once the master of the house has gotten up and shut the door , you may find yourself standing outside knocking on the door and begging , ‘ Lord , open the door for us. ’ He will say in reply , ‘ I do not know where you come from. ’
NCB	Luke	13	26	Then you will protest , ‘ We ate and drank with you , and you taught in our streets. ’
NCB	Luke	13	27	But he will say , ‘ I do not know where you come from . Depart from me , all you evildoers ! ’
NCB	Luke	13	28	“ There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the kingdom of God as you yourselves are being thrown out .
NCB	Luke	13	29	Then from the east and the west , and from the north and the south , people will come and take their places at the banquet in the kingdom of God .
NCB	Luke	13	30	Indeed some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last. ”
NCB	Luke	13	31	Herod ’ s Desire To Kill Jesus . [ f ] At that time , some Pharisees came and said to him , “ Leave this place and go somewhere else , for Herod wants to kill you. ”
NCB	Luke	13	32	He answered them , “ Go and tell that fox : ‘ Behold , today and tomorrow I will be casting out demons and healing people , and on the third day I will finish my work .
NCB	Luke	13	33	Yet I must continue to go on today and tomorrow and the next day , since it would not be right for a prophet to be killed outside Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	13	34	The Lament over Jerusalem . [ g ] “ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you murder the Prophets and stone the messengers sent to you ! How often have I longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings , but you would not allow it !
NCB	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house has been abandoned . I tell you , you will not see me until you say : ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 13:1 Jesus is told of a bloody repression that had just occurred in Galilee . He indicates that it is useless to fix the blame upon its victims ( see Jn 9:3 ) . Such events remind us that the judgment is only suspended and that death can surprise us at any time . Hence , they are a call to repent . - Luke 13:6 In the other Synoptic Gospels ( Mt 21:18-22 ; Mk 11:12-14 , 20-25 ) the incident of the barren fig tree stresses the strictness of the judgment . In Luke ’ s parable , the threat of judgment is replaced by a lesson on God ’ s patience . - Luke 13:10 The cure of a crippled woman on the Sabbath is in the eyes of the ancients a direct victory over Satan ; it is an act of God who sets human beings free . The religious leaders are prevented by their conformist attitude from recognizing the cure as an obvious sign from God . In the face of such absurd legalism Jesus calls for simple common sense . - Luke 13:18 The work of Jesus will have a future of infinite proportions although it had such seemingly insignificant beginnings . See notes on Mt 13:31-32 ; 13:32 ; and 13:33 . - Luke 13:22 This passage brings together scattered quotations of Jesus . After recalling that salvation demands effort and is not given by acquired privilege , the words open up frightful perspectives on the refusal of Israel while showing the Gentiles abounding in the kingdom . The religious conception is reversed here . People must not presume upon the certainty of their salvation . Salvation is a grace that needs their cooperation . - Luke 13:31 Some Pharisees who are friends of Jesus alert him to the danger , but he does not fear the ruler of Galilee . In his eyes , Herod is nothing more than a sly fox , and no longer the lion , symbol of mortal danger . Despite any threats , Christ is resolved to pursue his mission till the very end with its tragic result in Jerusalem . - Luke 13:34 Like the Prophets , Jesus foretells the destruction of the Holy City , but he also evokes a day when all peoples will acknowledge the Lord ( see Lk 21:24 ; Rom 11:25-27 ) . See also note on Mt 23:37-39 .
NCB	Luke	14	14	Then indeed will you be blessed because they have no way to repay you . But you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. ”
NCB	Luke	14	1	On one Sabbath , Jesus went to dine at the home of a prominent Pharisee , and the people were watching him closely .
NCB	Luke	14	2	In front of him there was a man suffering from dropsy ,
NCB	Luke	14	3	and Jesus asked the lawyers and the Pharisees , “ Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not ? ”
NCB	Luke	14	4	When they offered no reply , he took the man , healed him , and sent him on his way .
NCB	Luke	14	5	Then he said to them , “ If one of you has a son or an ox that has fallen into a well , will you not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day ? ”
NCB	Luke	14	6	And they were unable to give him any answer . The Parable of the Ambitious Guest . [ c ]
NCB	Luke	14	7	When he noticed how the guests were securing places of honor , he told them a parable :
NCB	Luke	14	8	“ When you have been invited by someone to attend a wedding banquet , do not sit down in the place of honor in case someone who is more distinguished than you may have been invited ,
NCB	Luke	14	9	and then the host who invited both of you may approach you and say , ‘ Give this man your place. ’ Then you will be embarrassed as you proceed to sit in the lowest place .
NCB	Luke	14	10	“ Rather , when you are invited , proceed to sit in the lowest place , so that when your host arrives , he will say to you , ‘ My friend , move up to a higher place. ’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests .
NCB	Luke	14	11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NCB	Luke	14	12	Invite the Needy . [ d ] Then he said to the one who had invited him , “ When you host a luncheon or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors , lest they invite you back and thus repay you .
NCB	Luke	14	13	Rather , when you hold a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , and the blind .
NCB	Luke	14	15	The Parable of the Great Supper . [ e ] On hearing this , one of the dinner guests said to him , “ Blessed is the man who will dine in the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Luke	14	16	Jesus said in reply , “ A man gave a sumptuous banquet , to which he invited many .
NCB	Luke	14	17	When the hour for the banquet drew near , he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited : ‘ Come , for everything is now ready. ’
NCB	Luke	14	18	“ But one after another they all began to make excuses . The first said , ‘ I have bought a parcel of land , and I must go out to inspect it . Please accept my apologies. ’
NCB	Luke	14	19	Another said , ‘ I have purchased five yoke of oxen , and I am on my way to try them out . Please accept my regrets. ’
NCB	Luke	14	20	Still another said , ‘ I have just gotten married , and therefore I am unable to come. ’
NCB	Luke	14	21	“ When the servant returned , he reported all this to his master . Then the owner of the house became enraged , and he said to his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in here the poor , the crippled , the blind , and the lame. ’
NCB	Luke	14	22	Shortly afterward , the servant told him , ‘ Sir , your orders have been carried out , and some room is still available. ’
NCB	Luke	14	23	Then the master said to the servant , ‘ Go out to the open roads and along the hedgerows and compel people to come , [ f ] so that my house may be filled .
NCB	Luke	14	24	For I tell you , not one of those who were invited shall taste my banquet. ’ ” Conditions To Be a Disciple [ g ]
NCB	Luke	14	25	Renunciation of Everything for Jesus . [ h ] Great crowds were accompanying Jesus on his journey , and he turned to them and said ,
NCB	Luke	14	26	,
NCB	Luke	14	27	,
NCB	Luke	14	28	[ j ] “ Which one of you , intending to build a tower , would not first sit down and estimate the cost , to see whether he has sufficient funds for its completion ?
NCB	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , if he has laid the foundation and then finds himself unable to finish the work , all who see it will ridicule him , saying ,
NCB	Luke	14	30	‘ There goes the man who started to build but was unable to complete the work. ’
NCB	Luke	14	31	“ Or what king marching into battle against another king will not first sit down and consider whether with ten thousand soldiers he can defeat the enemy coming to oppose him with twenty thousand ?
NCB	Luke	14	32	If he can not , then , while the enemy is still a long distance away , he will send a delegation to ask for terms of peace .
NCB	Luke	14	33	; Deut 21:15-16 ; Isa 60:15 ) . This renunciation is not some passing fancy but a radical demand : the two parables of the builder and the warrior could have been nothing more than simple invitations to reflect before deciding anything ; Luke turns them into a call to make a serious commitment . - Luke 14:26 Hate his father and mother : Jesus does not intend to abolish the fourth commandment about honoring and taking care of one ’ s parents . He simply sets forth the supreme conditions to be his disciple . In order to follow him , one must be disposed to sacrifice the most tender affections and even to renounce one ’ s life ( see Jn 12:25 ) . The expression is softened and explained in Mt 10:37 . - Luke 14:28 Whoever wishes to follow Jesus must weigh his own strengths so as not to launch out into a spiritual adventure thoughtlessly and rashly . Jesus illustrates this thought with two comparisons . - Luke 14:34 If the energy and conviction of disciples who have made a commitment begin to weaken , they become like salt that has lost its taste or its value .
NCB	Luke	14	34	The Simile of Salt . [ k ] “ Salt is good . But if salt loses its taste , what can be done to make it salty once again ?
NCB	Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the dungheap . Thus , it can only be thrown away . He who has ears to hear , let him hear ! ” Footnotes - Luke 14:1 Luke is an artful composer of Gospel scenes . Here he brings together different themes in the unfolding of a repast . The Jews thought of the kingdom of God as a gathering of people at a banquet in heaven . And , for Luke , this repast doubtless has the value of an announcement and a symbol . Jesus has the honor of being invited on the Sabbath to dine with a group of Pharisees , the representatives of Jewish thought . His hosts follow solid principles of thought and congratulate themselves on their good education . They closely watch Jesus ’ behavior out of curiosity mingled with apprehension . And one might say that Jesus goes out of his way to shock them . - Luke 14:1 Jesus does not lose himself in compliments and conversation but posits an act , a sign of the salvation that he brings to human beings . This is a new miracle , again performed on a Sabbath . Religion is for the liberation of persons , not their enslavement . To keep the Sabbath is to bear witness to it ( see Lk 6:6-11 ; 13:10-17 ) . See note on Mt 12:9-14 . - Luke 14:7 These reflections on the choice of places at a banquet could be nothing more than simple counsels of worldly wisdom . But Jesus wishes to stress that humility holds first place in the values of the kingdom , contrary to the values of the world ( see Lk 1:51-52 ; 18:14 ) . - Luke 14:12 A repast should not be a worldly affair . Luke calls for humility ( see Lk 1:53 ; 6:20 ; 7:22 ) and disinterest . - Luke 14:15 The kingdom of God is portrayed as a banquet in which God gathers together the Elect . People can refuse the call , but one day the gathering of joy will take place—this is one of Jesus ’ principal certitudes . The parable goes farther ; the officials , the habitués of religion , cheat themselves . Their affairs come before the joy of the kingdom , which opens itself to those who are regarded as ordinary and are often excluded : the marginalized of society or of religion . This proposal is shocking for official Judaism . And it should also be for any society that is closed in upon itself , and especially if it calls itself the Church of Jesus . See note on Mt 22:1-14 . - Luke 14:23 Compel people to come : they must be emphatic on the need to enter , but the Gospel excludes any coercion . - Luke 14:25 This section is tantamount to a short catechism on discipleship . The phrase “ can not be my disciple ” runs through it like a refrain ( vv .
NCB	Luke	15	15	So he went and hired himself out to one of the local inhabitants who sent him to his farm to feed the pigs . [ g ]
NCB	Luke	15	1	Now the tax collectors and sinners were all crowding around to listen to Jesus ,
NCB	Luke	15	2	and the Pharisees and the scribes began to complain , saying , “ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. ” The Parable of the Lost Sheep . [ c ]
NCB	Luke	15	3	Therefore , he told them this parable :
NCB	Luke	15	4	“ Which one of you , if you have a hundred sheep and lose one of them , will not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it ?
NCB	Luke	15	5	And when he does find it , he lays it on his shoulders joyfully .
NCB	Luke	15	6	Then , when he returns home , he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , because I have found my sheep that was lost. ’
NCB	Luke	15	7	In the same way , I tell you , there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance . The Parable of the Lost Coin . [ d ]
NCB	Luke	15	8	“ Or again , what woman who has ten silver coins [ e ] and loses one will not light a lamp and sweep the house , searching thoroughly until she finds it ?
NCB	Luke	15	9	And when she has found it , she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them , ‘ Rejoice with me , for I have found the coin that I lost. ’
NCB	Luke	15	10	In the same way , I tell you , there is rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ”
NCB	Luke	15	11	The Parable of the Lost ( or Prodigal ) Son . [ f ] Then he said : “ There was a man who had two sons .
NCB	Luke	15	12	The younger of them said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of your estate that I will inherit. ’ And so the father divided the property between them .
NCB	Luke	15	13	“ A few days later the younger son gathered together everything he had and traveled to a distant country , where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissolute living .
NCB	Luke	15	14	When he had spent it all , a severe famine afflicted that country , and he began to be in need .
NCB	Luke	15	16	He would have willingly filled his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating , but no one gave him anything .
NCB	Luke	15	17	“ Then he came to his senses and said , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired workers have more food than they can consume , while here I am , dying of hunger .
NCB	Luke	15	18	I will depart from this place and go to my father , and I will say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you .
NCB	Luke	15	19	I am no longer worthy to be called your son . Treat me like one of your hired workers. ” ’
NCB	Luke	15	20	“ So he set out for his father ’ s house . But while he was still a long way off , his father saw him and was filled with compassion . He ran to him , threw his arms around him , and kissed him .
NCB	Luke	15	21	Then the son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you . I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ’
NCB	Luke	15	22	“ But the father said to his servants , ‘ Quickly bring out the finest robe we have and put it on him . Place a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
NCB	Luke	15	23	Then bring the fatted calf and kill it , and let us celebrate with a feast .
NCB	Luke	15	24	For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life . He was lost , and now he has been found. ’ And they began to celebrate .
NCB	Luke	15	25	“ Now the elder son had been out in the fields , and as he returned and drew near the house , he could hear the sounds of music and dancing .
NCB	Luke	15	26	He summoned one of the servants and inquired what all this meant .
NCB	Luke	15	27	The servant replied , ‘ Your brother has come home , and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has him back safe and sound. ’
NCB	Luke	15	28	The elder son then became angry and refused to go in . His father came out and began to plead with him ,
NCB	Luke	15	29	but he said to his father in reply , ‘ All these years I have worked like a slave for you , and I never once disobeyed your orders . Even so , you have never even given me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends .
NCB	Luke	15	30	But when this son of yours returns after wasting his inheritance from you on prostitutes , you kill the fatted calf for him. ’
NCB	Luke	15	31	“ Then the father said to him , ‘ Son , you are with me always , and everything I have is yours .
NCB	Luke	15	32	But it was only right that we should celebrate and rejoice , because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life ; he was lost and now he has been found. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 15:1 These three joyous parables of Luke ’ s Gospel disclose the sentiments that the Father and Jesus have toward human beings . God is untiringly concerned for those who are far off , the sinners or unbelievers . His joy is to seek out and find those who are lost . This desire and this joy of God are revealed to us in the comportment of Christ himself toward sinners . In turn , the Church must trust in the mercy of God and must seek out and welcome those who seem far away . May she always bear witness to the value that human beings have in the eyes of God . - Luke 15:1 In the name of God ’ s love for sinners , Jesus overthrows several customs of his day . He refuses to accept the attitudes held by well-regarded religious figures : scorn toward others and smugness in their own self-sufficiency . - Luke 15:3 The parable of the lost sheep pushes antithesis to the extreme so that persons may never doubt God ’ s tenderness for them . - Luke 15:8 The parable of the lost coin demonstrates what a great contrast there is between the joy of heaven and the disdain of the Pharisees and the so-called clean ! - Luke 15:8 Coins : literally , “ drachmas , ” a drachma being the Greek coin corresponding to the Roman denarius , a laborer ’ s daily wage . - Luke 15:11 The parable of the prodigal son , one of the most enchanting stories of Jesus , completes the two preceding parables . It is God who awaits sinners , and it is humanity that is encouraged to seek God . We recognize in it all the misery of sin : abandonment , solitude , and distress . The parable describes the path to conversion and finally the great certitude of the believer : beyond all human hope , God harbors for every person the unfailing affection of a father for his child . He awaits the child and welcomes it joyously . It is easy to see in the discontent of the elder son the anger of the Pharisees at the welcome Jesus gives to sinners . - Luke 15:15 Pigs : unclean animals for the Jews .

Abraham ’ s side : literally , “ Abraham ’ s bosom ” ; in the language of the day this suggested the post of honor at the heavenly banquet ( see Mt 8:11 ) . - Luke 16:23 Netherworld : see note on Lk 10:15 .
NCB	Luke	16	2	Therefore , he summoned him and said , ‘ What are these reports that I hear about you ? Give me an accounting of your stewardship , because you can no longer be my steward. ’
NCB	Luke	16	3	“ Then the steward said to himself , ‘ What am I going to do , now that my master is dismissing me from being steward ? I am not strong enough to dig , and I am too ashamed to beg .
NCB	Luke	16	4	What I must do is to make sure that people will welcome me into their homes once I am removed from being steward. ’
NCB	Luke	16	5	“ Then he summoned his master ’ s debtors one by one . He asked the first , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
NCB	Luke	16	6	When he was told , ‘ One hundred jars of olive oil , ’ he said to the man , ‘ Take your bill , sit down quickly , and change the number to fifty. ’
NCB	Luke	16	7	Then he asked another , ‘ And you , how much do you owe ? ’ When he was told , ‘ One hundred measures of wheat , ’ he said to him , ‘ Take your bill and make it eighty. ’
NCB	Luke	16	8	The master commended the crafty steward because he had acted shrewdly . For the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the children of light . [ c ] Application of the Parable . [ d ]
NCB	Luke	16	9	) , and they earn and manage their goods with honesty ( vv . 10-11 ) . Yet money means little in reality ; the true good is the gift of God ( v.
NCB	Luke	16	10	“ Whoever can be trusted in small matters can also be trusted in great ones , but whoever is dishonest in small matters will also be dishonest in great ones .
NCB	Luke	16	11	Therefore , if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth , who will entrust you with true riches ?
NCB	Luke	16	12	) . Hence , the quest for gain and fortune must not be first in the life of Christians , for then money would become a false god for them ( v.
NCB	Luke	16	13	) . - Luke 16:14 More than once Jesus denounces the pretense of those who pass themselves off as religious people ( see Lk 11:39-40 ; 18:9 ; 20:47 ) . - Luke 16:16 The Law and the Prophets designates the Old Testament as it was read in the synagogues . We must make an effort in order to enter the kingdom of God . - Luke 16:17 The Law will not pass away , for it includes the whole revelation given to the chosen people , with its prophetic character ( see Lk 24:27 ,
NCB	Luke	16	14	A Saying against the Pharisees . [ e ] The Pharisees , who loved money , heard all this and they ridiculed him .
NCB	Luke	16	15	He said to them , “ You people pretend to be upright when you wish to impress others , but God knows what is in your hearts . That which is highly esteemed in the eyes of men is detestable in the sight of God .

NCB	Luke	16	19	The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus . [ i ] “ There was a rich man who used to dress in purple garments and the finest linen and who feasted sumptuously every day .
NCB	Luke	16	20	And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus , covered with sores ,
NCB	Luke	16	21	who would have been grateful to be fed with the scraps that fell from the rich man ’ s table . Even the dogs would come and lick his sores .
NCB	Luke	16	22	“ Now the poor man died , and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham ’ s side . The rich man also died and was buried .
NCB	Luke	16	23	In the netherworld , [ j ] where he was in torment , he looked up and saw Abraham , far off , and Lazarus by his side .
NCB	Luke	16	24	And he called out , ‘ Father Abraham , have pity on me . Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am in agony in these flames. ’
NCB	Luke	16	25	“ But Abraham replied , ‘ My child , remember that during your lifetime you received many good things , while Lazarus suffered greatly . Now he is being comforted while you are in agony .
NCB	Luke	16	26	Moreover , between us and you a great chasm has been established , so that no one who wishes to do so can pass from our side to yours , nor can anyone pass from your side to ours. ’
NCB	Luke	16	27	“ ‘ Then I beg you , father , ’ he said , ‘ to send him to my father ’ s house ,
NCB	Luke	16	28	to warn my five brothers , lest they too end up in this place of torment. ’
NCB	Luke	16	29	But Abraham responded , ‘ They have Moses and the Prophets . Let them listen to them. ’
NCB	Luke	16	30	“ He said , ‘ No , father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent. ’
NCB	Luke	16	31	Abraham answered , ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the Prophets , they will not be persuaded even if someone should rise from the dead. ’ ” Footnotes - Luke 16:1 From the very origins of the Gospel tradition , the parable of the crafty steward has created difficulty . People could evolve abusive applications from it : e.g. , does it promote fraud ? In order to avoid any false interpretation , different sentences of Jesus concerning money have been joined to the parable . - Luke 16:1 It is a fact that people bring a great deal of initiative and intelligence to their affairs even when these are worthy of criticism or unjust . Alas , believers put forth little effort for the kingdom ! This is the lesson to be retained from the parable . It is a call for lucidity and creative intelligence . Jesus is suggesting the skill of a swindler , not fraud or theft . - Luke 16:8 Children of light : a Hebrew expression signifying those enlightened by a superterrestrial faith as opposed to the children of this world , who are focused solely on their earthly interests . - Luke 16:9 Money dominates all of life and society . The attitude toward money is a test of the fidelity of Christians . Those who seek imperishable goods are detached from perishable ones . They know how to give alms ( v.
NCB	Luke	16	44	) . - Luke 16:18 Divorce was allowed and regulated by Old Testament law ( see Deut 24:1-4 ) . The position of Jesus is a radical one , as numerous New Testament passages attest ( see Mt 5:31-32 ; 19:1-12 ; Mk 10:1-12 ;
NCB	Luke	17	17	Jesus asked , “ Were not all ten made clean ? Where are the other nine ?
NCB	Luke	17	1	Jesus said to his disciples , “ Scandals are bound to occur , but woe to the man through whom they come !
NCB	Luke	17	2	It would be better for him if a millstone were fastened around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin .
NCB	Luke	17	3	Be on your guard ! The Need To Forgive . [ b ] “ If your brother should sin , rebuke him , and if he repents , forgive him .
NCB	Luke	17	4	Even if he wrongs you seven times a day , and comes back to you seven times to say , ‘ I am sorry , ’ you must forgive him. ” Faith Knows How To Make Miracles . [ c ]
NCB	Luke	17	5	The apostles said to the Lord , “ Increase our faith. ”
NCB	Luke	17	6	The Lord replied , “ If you had faith as tiny as a mustard seed , you could say to this mulberry tree , ‘ Be uprooted and planted in the sea , ’ and it would obey you . Unprofitable Servants . [ d ]
NCB	Luke	17	7	“ Which of you , when your servant returns from plowing or tending sheep in the fields , would say to him , ‘ Come right away and sit down to eat ’ ?
NCB	Luke	17	8	Would you not rather say , ‘ Prepare my dinner , put on your apron , and wait on me while I eat and drink , and then afterward you yourself may eat and drink ’ ?
NCB	Luke	17	9	Would you be grateful to that servant for doing what he was commanded ?
NCB	Luke	17	10	So should it be with you . When you have done all that you were ordered to do , say , ‘ We are unprofitable servants ; we have only done our duty. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	17	11	Jesus Heals Ten Men with Leprosy . [ e ] As he continued on his journey to Jerusalem , he traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee .

NCB	Luke	17	13	they called out to him , “ Jesus , Master , have pity on us. ”
NCB	Luke	17	14	When he saw them , he said , “ Go and show yourselves to the priests. ” And as they went , they were cleansed .
NCB	Luke	17	15	One of them , when he realized that he had been cured , came back , praising God in a loud voice .
NCB	Luke	17	16	He prostrated himself at the feet of Jesus and thanked him . This man was a Samaritan .
NCB	Luke	17	18	Has no one except this foreigner returned to give thanks to God ? ”
NCB	Luke	17	19	Then he said to him , “ Stand up and go on your way . Your faith has made you well. ”
NCB	Luke	17	20	The Coming of the Kingdom of God . [ f ] Once , the Pharisees asked him when the kingdom of God was coming . He answered , “ The coming of the kingdom of God will not occur with signs that can be observed .
NCB	Luke	17	21	Nor will people say , ‘ Here it is , ’ or ‘ There it is. ’ For the kingdom of God is in your midst. ”
NCB	Luke	17	22	The Day of the Son of Man . [ g ] Then he said to his disciples , “ The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and you will not see it .
NCB	Luke	17	23	People will say to you , ‘ Look , there he is , ’ or ‘ Look , here he is. ’ Do not go running after them .
NCB	Luke	17	24	For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other , so will the Son of Man be in his day .
NCB	Luke	17	25	But first he must endure great suffering and be rejected by this generation .
NCB	Luke	17	26	“ Just as it was in the days of Noah , so will it also be in the days of the Son of Man .
NCB	Luke	17	27	People were eating and drinking , marrying and being given in marriage , up to the day that Noah entered the ark . Then the flood came and destroyed all of them .
NCB	Luke	17	28	“ The same thing happened in the days of Lot . People were eating and drinking , buying and selling , planting and building .
NCB	Luke	17	29	But on the day that Lot left Sodom , fire and brimstone rained down from heaven and destroyed all of them .
NCB	Luke	17	30	“ It will be like that on the day that the Son of Man is revealed .
NCB	Luke	17	31	On that day , the one who is standing on the roof , with his possessions inside , must not come down to collect them , and someone who is in the field must not turn back .
NCB	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot ’ s wife .
NCB	Luke	17	33	Whoever tries to preserve his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life will save it .
NCB	Luke	17	34	“ I tell you , on that night two people will be in one bed . One will be taken and the other will be left .
NCB	Luke	17	35	And there will be two women grinding grain together . One will be taken and the other will be left . [
NCB	Luke	17	36	Two men will be out in the field . One will be taken and the other will be left . ] ” [ h ]
NCB	Luke	17	37	They asked him , “ Where , Lord ? ” He said in reply , “ Where the corpse is , there the vultures will gather. ” Footnotes - Luke 17:1 Scandal is the snare that one extends to others in order to lead them into evil . It is especially grave when it is placed along the way of the “ little ones. ” - Luke 17:3 Fraternal pardon is one of the best signs of the presence of the Gospel . Faults among brothers and sisters are continual ; hence , openness to reconciliation must be constant . - Luke 17:5 See note on Mt 21:18-22 . - Luke 17:7 The Pharisees and many religious people are more concerned about their reward than about what they can do for God . The disciple is subservient to his master in a work that is far greater than himself . That is his happiness and his recompense even here below . - Luke 17:11 The episode of the ten people afflicted with leprosy illustrates first of all the ingratitude of Israel—which believes that the gifts of God are owed to it—and the faith of the Gentiles . For a Jewish author , it is odious to give an example containing a Samaritan , a heretic regarded as more disgraceful than a pagan . However , a stranger more open to the Lord ’ s call than the average believer would provide an example capable of inculcating admiration forever . - Luke 17:20 As for when the kingdom will come , it is useless to wait for mysterious signs . The kingdom is already at work in the personal action of Jesus . - Luke 17:22 This description of events must be read in light of the particular literary genre being used , but this does not lessen its urgency . The other two Synoptic Gospels place these exhortations in the “ eschatological discourse. ” - Luke 17:36 Some manuscripts add this verse , probably taken from Mt 24:40 .
NCB	Luke	18	18	The Rich Young Man . [ d ] A certain ruler asked him , “ Good Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ”
NCB	Luke	18	1	Then Jesus told them a parable about the need for them to pray always and never to lose heart .
NCB	Luke	18	2	He said , “ In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor had any respect for people .
NCB	Luke	18	3	In that same town there was a widow who kept coming to him and pleading , ‘ Grant me justice against my adversary. ’
NCB	Luke	18	4	“ For a long time he refused her request , but finally he said to himself , ‘ Even though I neither fear God nor have any respect for people ,
NCB	Luke	18	5	yet because this widow keeps pestering me , I will see to it that she gets justice . Otherwise , she will keep coming and wear me out. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	18	6	Then the Lord said , “ You have heard what the unjust judge says .
NCB	Luke	18	7	Will not God , therefore , grant justice to his elect who cry out to him day and night ? Will he delay in answering their pleas ?
NCB	Luke	18	8	I tell you , he will grant them justice quickly . But when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? ” The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector . [ b ]
NCB	Luke	18	9	He also told the following parable to some people who prided themselves about their own righteousness and regarded others with contempt :
NCB	Luke	18	10	“ Two men went up to the temple to pray . One was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector .
NCB	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood up and said this prayer to himself : ‘ I thank you , God , that I am not like other people—greedy , dishonest , adulterous—or even like this tax collector .
NCB	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week and pay tithes on all my income. ’
NCB	Luke	18	13	“ The tax collector , however , stood some distance away and would not even raise his eyes to heaven . Rather , he kept beating his breast as he said , ‘ God , be merciful to me , a sinner. ’
NCB	Luke	18	14	This man , I tell you , returned to his home justified , whereas the other did not . For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ”
NCB	Luke	18	15	Jesus Blesses the Children . [ c ] People were bringing even infants to Jesus so that he might touch them . When the disciples observed this , they rebuked them .
NCB	Luke	18	16	However , Jesus called the children to him and said , “ Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them . For it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs .
NCB	Luke	18	17	Amen , I say to you , whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it. ”
NCB	Luke	18	19	Jesus said to him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good but God alone .
NCB	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments : ‘ Do not commit adultery . Do not kill . Do not steal . Do not bear false witness . Honor your father and your mother. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	18	21	The man replied , “ I have kept all these since I was a child. ”
NCB	Luke	18	22	On hearing this , Jesus said to him , “ You need to do one further thing . Sell everything you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ”
NCB	Luke	18	23	But when he heard this , he became sad , because he was very rich .
NCB	Luke	18	24	Danger of Riches . Jesus looked at him and said , “ How difficult it is for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God !
NCB	Luke	18	25	Indeed , it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Luke	18	26	Those who heard this asked , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NCB	Luke	18	27	He replied , “ What is impossible for men is possible for God. ”
NCB	Luke	18	28	The Reward of Renunciation . Peter said to him , “ We have given up our homes to follow you. ”
NCB	Luke	18	29	Jesus replied , “ Amen , I say to you , there is no one who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
NCB	Luke	18	30	who will not receive many times as much in this age , and eternal life in the age to come. ”
NCB	Luke	18	31	Jesus Predicts His Passion a Third Time . [ e ] Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them , “ Behold , we are now going up to Jerusalem , and everything that has been written by the Prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled .
NCB	Luke	18	32	He will be handed over to the Gentiles , and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon .
NCB	Luke	18	33	After they have scourged him , they will put him to death , and on the third day he will rise again. ”
NCB	Luke	18	34	But they understood nothing of this . Its meaning remained obscure to them , and they failed to comprehend what he was telling them .
NCB	Luke	18	35	Jesus Heals a Blind Man . [ f ] As Jesus approached Jericho , a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging .
NCB	Luke	18	36	When he heard the crowd going past , he inquired what was happening .
NCB	Luke	18	37	They told him , “ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. ”
NCB	Luke	18	38	He shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
NCB	Luke	18	39	The people in front rebuked him and ordered him to be silent , but he only shouted all the louder , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
NCB	Luke	18	40	Jesus stopped and ordered that the man be brought to him . And when he had come near , Jesus asked him ,
NCB	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He answered , “ Lord , let me receive my sight. ”
NCB	Luke	18	42	Jesus said to him , “ Receive your sight . Your faith has made you well. ”
NCB	Luke	18	43	Immediately , he received his sight and followed Jesus , praising God . And all the people who witnessed this also gave praise to God . Footnotes - Luke 18:1 We might ask whether prayer is useless or whether it is unfitting to remain insistent in God ’ s presence . This parable recommends a tenacious persistence . If the Lord is tardy in coming or in responding , it is to allow time for conversion and for faith . But the prayer of believers is not a cry in the wind . It is especially necessary during the end times , which will be a great trial for the faith and for trust in the Lord . - Luke 18:9 What Jesus criticizes is not the Pharisee ’ s ascetical effort but his sense of self-sufficiency before God , himself , and other human beings , and his harshness toward others . On the other hand , Jesus does not approve of the everyday behavior of the tax collector , but offers his sincerity , humility , and repentance as an example . God ’ s goodness bewilders us : from it sinners can expect compassion and grace ; salvation is an unmerited and unexpected gift . - Luke 18:15 One must receive the kingdom as a little child , that is , as a poor person who is regarded as insignificant in society and who awaits everything from its father . One can never stop being struck by this insistence of Jesus concerning the spirit of childhood . It is a reversal of the daily norms of our lives ( see Lk 9:46-48 ) . - Luke 18:18 A rich young man is animated by the desire for a more personal commitment , going beyond the simple observance of the ten commandments . However , he can not resolve himself to the first radical gesture—giving up his possessions . The Christian community retained this example as a warning . Riches , as Luke often stresses , are an obstacle to salvation . In a life encumbered by riches , there is no place for the Lord . Yet the Lord fills to the brim whoever has the courage to prefer him to everything else . Such courage is the gift of God ( see Lk 12:33 ) . - Luke 18:31 Six times in Luke ’ s Gospel Jesus refers to his tragic end , so deeply does this affect his entire work . The Prophets had borne witness to it beforehand . - Luke 18:35 The community retains this episode as an example of faith and witness to Jesus , Son of David , that is , the people ’ s Messiah and Savior .
NCB	Luke	19	19	He said to him , ‘ You shall be in charge of five cities. ’
NCB	Luke	19	1	Ki 1:33-40 ) . The surprising thing is the modest circumstances : the colt is the mount of the poor , the mount of the ancient period of nomadism . The Old Testament imagined various scenarios for the coming of the Messiah ; they were all glorious , except for one , that of Zechariah ( 9:9 ) . - Luke 19:41 Luke alone records the incident of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem—here and in Lk 13:34 , although Mt 23:21 does show Jesus grieving over it . The method mentioned by which Israel ’ s enemies will conquer and level Jerusalem is precisely the one used by the Romans in A.D.
NCB	Luke	19	2	A man there , named Zacchaeus , was a chief tax collector and a rich man .
NCB	Luke	19	3	He wanted to see who Jesus was , but since he was short in stature , he could not see him because of the crowd .
NCB	Luke	19	4	B.C . to obtain the succession to Herod the Great in Judea , and whose return was marked by a slaughter not yet forgotten in the memory of the people . - Luke 19:13 Gold coins : literally , minas ; a mina , was a Greek coin equal to a hundred drachmas or Roman denarii , that is , a hundred times the daily wage of a laborer . In the time of Jesus , it weighed about
NCB	Luke	19	5	When he reached that spot , Jesus looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , hurry and come down , for I must stay at your house today. ”
NCB	Luke	19	6	Zacchaeus came down quickly and welcomed him joyfully .
NCB	Luke	19	7	When the people observed this , they began to complain , saying , “ He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. ”
NCB	Luke	19	8	But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord , “ Behold , Lord , I intend to give half of everything I possess to the poor , and if I have defrauded someone of anything , I will repay that amount four times over. ”
NCB	Luke	19	9	Then Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , because this man too is a son of Abraham .
NCB	Luke	19	10	For the Son of Man has come to seek out and to save what was lost. ”
NCB	Luke	19	11	The Parable of the Ten Gold Coins . [ b ] While the people were listening to him speak , Jesus went on to tell them a parable , because now he was near Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God might appear immediately .
NCB	Luke	19	12	He said , “ A man of noble birth was preparing to go to a distant country to receive a kingdom and then return .
NCB	Luke	19	13	So he summoned ten of his servants and gave them ten gold coins , [ c ] instructing them , ‘ Trade with the money I have given you until I return. ’
NCB	Luke	19	14	But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation after him to give this message , ‘ We do not want this man to be our king. ’
NCB	Luke	19	15	“ When he returned after having been made king , he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money to ascertain what profit they had made through their trading .
NCB	Luke	19	16	The first came forward and said , ‘ Sir , your money has increased tenfold in value. ’
NCB	Luke	19	17	He said to him , ‘ Well done , my good servant . Because you have proved trustworthy in this very small matter , you shall be in charge of ten cities. ’
NCB	Luke	19	18	“ Next , the second servant came forward and said , ‘ Sir , your money has increased fivefold in value. ’
NCB	Luke	19	20	“ Then the third one came forward , saying , ‘ Sir , here is your money . I kept it wrapped up in a handkerchief .
NCB	Luke	19	21	For I was afraid of you , because you are a hard man . You take out what you did not put down , and you reap what you did not sow. ’
NCB	Luke	19	22	“ The master said to him , ‘ I will condemn you by your own words , you wicked servant . You knew I was a hard man , taking out what I did not put down , and reaping what I did not sow .
NCB	Luke	19	23	Why then did you not deposit my money into a bank so that on my return I could have drawn it out with interest ? ’
NCB	Luke	19	24	“ Then he said to those standing by , ‘ Take the money from him and give it to the one with the ten gold coins. ’
NCB	Luke	19	25	They said to him , ‘ But sir , he already has ten gold coins. ’
NCB	Luke	19	26	He replied , ‘ I tell you , to everyone who has , more will be given , but from the one who has not , even what he does have will be taken away .
NCB	Luke	19	27	But as for those enemies of mine who did not want me for their king , bring them here and put them to death in my presence. ’ ” The Activity of Jesus at Jerusalem [ d ]
NCB	Luke	19	28	Jesus Enters Jerusalem as the Messiah . [ e ] After he had said this , Jesus proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	19	29	As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the place called the Mount of Olives , he sent off two of the disciples , saying ,
NCB	Luke	19	30	“ Go into the village directly ahead , and upon entering it , you will find tied there a colt on which no one has ever ridden . Untie it and bring it here .
NCB	Luke	19	31	If anyone asks you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ simply say , ‘ The Lord needs it. ’ ”
NCB	Luke	19	32	The two disciples who had been sent went off and found everything just as he had told them .
NCB	Luke	19	33	As they were untying the colt , its owners asked them , “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”
NCB	Luke	19	34	They answered , “ The Lord needs it. ”
NCB	Luke	19	35	Then they brought the colt to Jesus , and after spreading their cloaks over the colt , they helped Jesus to mount it .
NCB	Luke	19	36	As he rode along , people kept spreading their cloaks on the road .
NCB	Luke	19	37	And when he approached the downward path of the Mount of Olives , the entire multitude of his disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen him perform ,
NCB	Luke	19	38	proclaiming : “ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord . Peace in heaven and glory in the highest heavens. ”
NCB	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples. ”
NCB	Luke	19	40	He answered , “ I tell you , if they keep silent , the stones will cry out. ”
NCB	Luke	19	41	The Lament over Jerusalem . [ f ] As Jesus drew near and beheld the city , he wept over it ,
NCB	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If only you had recognized on this day what would bring you peace ! But now it is hidden from your sight .
NCB	Luke	19	43	Indeed , the days will come upon you when your enemies will raise up fortifications all around you and hem you in on every side .
NCB	Luke	19	44	They will smash you to the ground , you and your children with you , and they will not leave one stone upon another in you , because you did not recognize the time of your visitation. ”
NCB	Luke	19	45	Jesus Cleanses the Temple . [ g ] Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were engaging in selling ,
NCB	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer , ’ but you have made it a den of thieves. ”
NCB	Luke	19	47	Every day he was teaching in the temple . But the chief priests , the scribes , and the leaders of the people plotted to kill him .
NCB	Luke	19	48	However , they were unable to do so because all the people hung on his every word . Footnotes - Luke 19:1 The lesson is obvious : it is God who saves the rich ( see Lk 18:27 ) , because he alone can change the human heart . Zacchaeus ’ s generosity in atoning for the wrongs he has done goes beyond anything the Jewish or the Roman law could require of a judged and condemned thief . - Luke 19:11 This parable is unusual in that its chief personage is an aspirant to the throne , for it seems to be inspired by the story of Archelaus , who went to Rome in
NCB	Luke	19	350	grams of silver . - Luke 19:28 The Messiah reaches Jerusalem , where he is to complete God ’ s plan . His encounter with the city is a powerful one , but will end in his rejection . The plan of God will nonetheless be carried out in a way different from human expectations : in suffering , Death , and Resurrection , in the Paschal Mystery . - Luke 19:28 By accepting the acclamations of his many disciples , Jesus proclaims himself to be the Messiah , the king , the son of David , whom Israel has awaited . The scene seems to be a repetition of the ceremony of Solomon ’ s proclamation and consecration ( see
NCB	Luke	19	70	. - Luke 19:45 Jesus demands respect for the temple and installs himself in it to proclaim the message of God . It is thus that he conceives and exercises the royal authority of the Messiah . Like the Prophets , he refuses to allow religion to deteriorate into a business affair .
NCB	Luke	20	20	God or Caesar . [ d ] So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honorable men . They intended to trap Jesus in something he might say so that they could hand him over to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor .
NCB	Luke	20	1	One day as Jesus was teaching in the temple and proclaiming the good news , the chief priests and scribes , accompanied by the elders , approached and
NCB	Luke	20	2	Sam 7:1-17 ) . Citing an ancient royal psalm , Jesus conveys that the Messiah is of divine origin and that he will bring a kingdom that transcends anything we might ordinarily imagine . - Luke 20:45 Jesus reproaches the teachers of religious thought for their vanity ( Lk 11:43 ) , greed ( Lk 16:14 ) , and artificial and ostentatious piety ( Lk 18:11-12 ) .
NCB	Luke	20	3	He said to them in reply , “ I will also ask you one question . Tell me :
NCB	Luke	20	4	Did John ’ s baptism originate from heaven or from men ? ”
NCB	Luke	20	5	of Isaiah , we understand that it is God who puts the authorities of this people on trial . The parable sums up in a few words the entire history of conflict between the leaders and God ’ s messengers ; is not the last messenger , that is , the heir , Jesus himself ? See also note on Mt 21:33-46 . - Luke 20:20 The tribute was a tax collected by the Roman occupiers . To justify its payment meant collaborating with the enemy of the people ; to disallow its payment meant labeling oneself as rebellious in the eyes of the Romans . The snare seems to be inescapable , but Jesus foils the plan by loudly proclaiming the absolute primacy of God ( see Lk 12:31 ) . See also note on Mt 22:15-22 . - Luke 20:24 Coin : i.e. , a denarius , the normal day ’ s wage for a laborer at that time . - Luke 20:27 The party of the Jewish high priests had not yet accepted the belief in the resurrection that had been proclaimed for two or three centuries ( Dan 12:2-3 ) and that the Pharisees had accepted ( see Acts 23:8 ) . When the present life is taken as a model of the future life , the reality of the resurrection is misunderstood , since the resurrection radically transforms the human condition . - Luke 20:41 Most Jews expected the Messiah to be simply an heir of God ’ s chosen king ( see
NCB	Luke	20	6	But if we say : ‘ From men , ’ all the people will stone us , for they are convinced that John was a prophet. ”
NCB	Luke	20	7	Therefore , they answered that they did not know where it came from .
NCB	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said to them , “ Then neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” The Parable of the Tenants . [ c ]
NCB	Luke	20	9	Then Jesus began to tell the people this parable : “ A man planted a vineyard , leased it to tenants , and went off on a journey for a long period .
NCB	Luke	20	10	“ When the time arrived , he sent a servant to the tenants to receive his share of the produce of the vineyard . But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed .
NCB	Luke	20	11	Again , he sent another servant , but him they also beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed .
NCB	Luke	20	12	Then he sent a third servant , but him too they wounded and cast out .
NCB	Luke	20	13	“ Then the owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son . Perhaps they will respect him. ’
NCB	Luke	20	14	But when the tenants saw him , they said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours. ’
NCB	Luke	20	15	And so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . “ What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
NCB	Luke	20	16	He will come and put those tenants to death and give the vineyard to others. ” When the people heard this , they said , “ God forbid ! ”
NCB	Luke	20	17	But Jesus looked directly at them and said , “ Then what is the meaning of that which is written : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ’ ?
NCB	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken into pieces , and the one on whom it falls will be crushed. ”
NCB	Luke	20	19	The scribes and the chief priests realized that this parable was directed at them , and they wanted to seize him at that very hour , but they feared the people .
NCB	Luke	20	21	They posed this question to him : “ Teacher , we know that you say and teach what is right . Moreover , you show no partiality to anyone but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth .
NCB	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful or not for us to pay taxes to Caesar ? ”
NCB	Luke	20	23	Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them ,
NCB	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a coin . [ e ] Whose image is this , and whose inscription ? ” They replied , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NCB	Luke	20	25	He said to them , “ Give to Caesar what is due to Caesar , and to God what is due to God. ”
NCB	Luke	20	26	They found they could not trap him by anything he said in the presence of the people , and , stunned at his reply , they fell silent .
NCB	Luke	20	27	Marriage and the Resurrection . [ f ] Then some Sadducees , who assert that there is no resurrection , approached him and posed this question :
NCB	Luke	20	28	“ Teacher , Moses wrote down for us that if a man ’ s brother dies , having a wife but no children , the man must marry his brother ’ s wife and raise up children for his brother .
NCB	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers . The first married a woman but died childless .
NCB	Luke	20	30	Then the second
NCB	Luke	20	31	and the third married the widow , and it was the same with all seven : they all died leaving no children .
NCB	Luke	20	32	Last of all , the woman also died .
NCB	Luke	20	33	Now at the resurrection , whose wife will the woman be , inasmuch as all seven had her ? ”
NCB	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ The children of this age marry and are given in marriage ,
NCB	Luke	20	35	but those who are judged worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection of the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage .
NCB	Luke	20	36	They are no longer subject to death , for they are like angels ; and they are the children of God because they are children of the resurrection .
NCB	Luke	20	37	“ That the dead are raised Moses himself showed in the account about the bush where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
NCB	Luke	20	38	He is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for in his sight all are alive. ”
NCB	Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes then said , “ Teacher , you have answered well. ”
NCB	Luke	20	40	And they no longer dared to ask him anything .
NCB	Luke	20	41	Jesus Is Lord . [ g ] Then Jesus said to them , “ How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David ?
NCB	Luke	20	42	For David himself says in the Book of Psalms : ‘ The Lord said to my Lord : “ Sit at my right hand
NCB	Luke	20	43	until I make your enemies your footstool. ” ’
NCB	Luke	20	44	David thus calls him ‘ Lord ’ ; so how can he be his son ? ”
NCB	Luke	20	45	Denunciation of the Scribes . [ h ] While all the people were listening , Jesus said to his disciples ,
NCB	Luke	20	46	“ Beware of the scribes who like to walk around in long robes and who love to be greeted respectfully in the marketplaces , and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .
NCB	Luke	20	47	They devour the houses of widows , while for the sake of appearance they recite lengthy prayers . They will receive the severest possible condemnation. ” Footnotes - Luke 20:1 “ Who gave you this authority ? ” Sooner or later , such a question was bound to be asked of Jesus . However , coming from the members of the Jewish high tribunal , it is nothing more than a snare . Jesus places himself in solidarity with John the Baptist , the envoy of God . If they do not have the courage to speak about the dead prophet , how can they be ready to loyally confront the response of Christ ? He reduces them to silence , debate being useless . - Luke 20:1 See note on Mk 11:27-33 . - Luke 20:9 When we read ch .
NCB	Luke	21	21	Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains , and those who are within the city must escape from its boundaries , and those who are in country areas must not return .
NCB	Luke	21	1	Looking up , Jesus saw wealthy people putting their offerings into the treasury ,
NCB	Luke	21	2	and he also noticed a poor widow putting in two copper coins .
NCB	Luke	21	3	He said : “ Truly I tell you , this poor widow has given more than all the rest .
NCB	Luke	21	4	For the others have all contributed out of their abundance , but she out of her poverty has given all that she had to live on. ” The Destruction of the Temple and the Return of Christ [ b ] Jesus Announces the Destruction of the Temple . [ c ] When some people were talking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and votive offerings , Jesus remarked ,
NCB	Luke	21	6	“ As for all these things that you are gazing at now , the time will come when not one stone here will be left upon another ; everything will be thrown down. ” The Signs of the End . [ d ]
NCB	Luke	21	7	They then asked him , “ Teacher , when will this happen ? And what will be the sign that it is about to take place ? ”
NCB	Luke	21	8	He answered , “ Take care not to be deceived . For many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and ‘ The time is near. ’ Do not follow them .
NCB	Luke	21	9	And when you hear of wars and insurrections , do not be terrified , for those things are bound to take place first , but the end will not follow immediately. ”
NCB	Luke	21	10	Then he added , “ Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom .
NCB	Luke	21	11	There will be tremendous earthquakes , famines , and plagues in various places , as well as dreadful portents and great signs from heaven .
NCB	Luke	21	12	The Coming Persecution. “ But before all this happens , they will seize you and persecute you . You will be handed over to synagogues and imprisoned , and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name .
NCB	Luke	21	13	This will give you an opportunity to bear witness to me .
NCB	Luke	21	14	But do not even consider preparing your defense beforehand ,
NCB	Luke	21	15	for I myself will give you a depth of wisdom and eloquence that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict .
NCB	Luke	21	16	“ You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers , relatives and friends , and some of you will be put to death .
NCB	Luke	21	17	You will be hated by all because of my name ,
NCB	Luke	21	18	but not a hair of your head will be lost .
NCB	Luke	21	19	B.C. , Herod the Great undertook a splendid reconstruction of the temple . The very magnificence of the restored temple caused a sense of self-reliance and presumption ( see Lk 13:34-35 ; 19:46 ; Jer 7:1-15 ;
NCB	Luke	21	20	The Great Trial . [ e ] “ When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies , you may be certain that her desolation is near .
NCB	Luke	21	22	For those will be days of retribution when all that is written will come to pass .
NCB	Luke	21	23	“ Woe to those who are pregnant and those who are nursing infants in those days . For there will be great distress on the earth , and terrible wrath shall afflict this people .
NCB	Luke	21	24	They will fall by the sword and be carried away as captives among all the nations , and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles have been fulfilled .
NCB	Luke	21	25	The Coming of the Son of Man . [ f ] “ There will be signs in the sun , the moon , and the stars , and on earth nations will be in great distress , bewildered at the roaring of the sea and its waves .
NCB	Luke	21	26	; Ezek 8:11 ; Mic 3:9-12 ) . - Luke 21:7 For a Jew , the destruction of the temple inaugurates the great tribulation of the end times . We understand that the disciples are worried . Jesus gives them signs : those more distant ( vv . 10-11 ) will be taken up again even later on ( vv . 25-26 ) ; those closer describe the events of the troubled years 66–70 : appearances of false messiahs , civil wars and struggles , persecution of Christians . This persecution is a privileged sign of the coming of the kingdom of God , and it is seen to be severe . But let those who bear witness to Christ take courage , for they will not be abandoned . The Passion is the way to glory for the Christian community as it is for the Lord . Courage will be given to them to announce the essence of the message : Jesus Christ dead , risen , and to come . - Luke 21:20 The evils that overtake the holy city are like a judgment of God upon it . But the tragic fate of Jerusalem and its temple inaugurates the laborious period in which is born the new world until all the pagans have heard the Good News of salvation and Israel itself is converted ( see Rom 11:25-27 ) . - Luke 21:25 At the end of the final crisis , which is described in the violent images dear to the Prophets and the authors of the apocalypses ( see Isa 13:10 ; 24:23 ; 34:4 ; Ezek 32:7-8 ; Joel 4:15 ) , Jesus , the victorious Christ , will come to judge the world and deliver those who have remained faithful and are ready to welcome him ( see Dan 7:13 ) . The signs , especially persecutions , are pledges of hope and deliverance ( see Rom 8:23 ; Eph 1:14 ; 4:30 ) . - Luke 21:32 In the apocalyptic genre , a “ generation ” signifies an age of the world , a stage in God ’ s plan . - Luke 21:34 Since in Luke ’ s perspective the end of the world is not considered to be imminent , the exhortation to be vigilant voiced here is more pressing so that the delay may not numb the heart of the Christian . At the same time , there is an invitation to pray that the day of the Lord may not come unexpectedly and find us unprepared to appear before the divine Judge . - Luke 21:37 During the final week of his life ( Sunday to Thursday ) , Jesus taught in the temple in the morning , and all the people came to hear him .
NCB	Luke	21	27	And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
NCB	Luke	21	28	When these things begin to take place , look up and hold your heads high , because the time of your redemption is drawing near. ”
NCB	Luke	21	29	The Parable of the Fig Tree . Then he told them this parable : “ Look at the fig tree or indeed at any other tree .
NCB	Luke	21	30	As soon as it begins to bud , you know that summer is already near .
NCB	Luke	21	31	In the same way , when you see these things come to pass , know that the kingdom of God is near .
NCB	Luke	21	32	Amen , I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place . [ g ]
NCB	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth will pass away , but my words will never pass away .
NCB	Luke	21	34	Exhortation To Be Vigilant . [ h ] “ Be on your guard lest your hearts be weighed down by carousing and drunkenness and the anxieties of this life and that day will catch you unawares ,
NCB	Luke	21	35	like a trap . For that day will come upon everyone in the world .
NCB	Luke	21	36	Be vigilant at all times , praying for the strength to survive all those things that will take place and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man. ”
NCB	Luke	21	37	Jesus ’ Last Days in Jerusalem . [ i ] Each day Jesus was teaching in the temple , but every evening he would go forth and spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives .
NCB	Luke	21	38	And all the people would rise early every morning to listen to him in the temple . Footnotes - Luke 21:1 See note on Mk 12:41-44 . - Luke 21:5 Scenes of terror and visions of hope alternate in this great discourse . If we are to understand its tone and vocabulary , we must put ourselves in the atmosphere created by various terrifying and magnificent pages of the Old Testament . On the eve of the catastrophe that destroyed both Jerusalem , for the first time , and the state of Israel in
NCB	Luke	21	587	B.C. , some prophets had a presentiment of the spiritual ruin of the people and had warned them , with harsh invectives , of future punishments . Later on , people began to ask about the ultimate destiny of the world and humanity ; this created a restlessness that was eschatological , that is , concerned with the ultimate end , the last times .
NCB	Luke	21	5	In the “ apocalypses ” or “ revelations , ” some authors imagined awe-inspiring scenes of wars , disasters , and judgment , which would usher in the coming of God and the salvation of the people . These accounts , which are to be read in accordance with their particular literary genre , always remain bewildering . - Luke 21:5 Around the year
NCB	Luke	22	22	The Son of Man goes on his appointed path , but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed. ”
NCB	Luke	22	1	Ki 19:7-8 ) , does not mitigate the tragedy of the moment . This passage remains one of the great texts on the distress of human beings in the face of their death . It is intended to be a lesson , as is emphasized , from its beginning to its end , by the repeated invitation to pray so as not to be the prey of a temptation that seems to be all-consuming . - Luke 22:43 These two verses are not found in some early mss . - Luke 22:47 Immediately cutting short any resistance on the part of his disciples , Jesus heals the servant wounded by one of them—this is the single miracle in the account of the Passion . It is typical of Luke that the servant be healed ( for tradition holds that Luke was a physician ) . - Luke 22:53 All the events happen under the sign of Satan , who has stirred up the powers of darkness against Jesus . - Luke 22:54 Luke seems to report the true chronology of the events more exactly than Matthew and Mark . After his arrest , Jesus is quickly brought to the house of the high priest , where Annas his predecessor most likely also dwelled . Annas interrogates him but in a private manner ( Jn 18:12-24 ) . While Jesus is waiting for the trial , which according to Luke took place only in the morning , the guards pass time by insulting him and making fun of him . Peter finds himself in the same courtyard and , recognized by the bystanders , denies his Master . Jesus , who has probably heard everything from where he stood , looks at him ( a point mentioned only by Luke ) , strengthening him in his faith that had been profoundly shaken ( v.
NCB	Luke	22	2	and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for some way to put Jesus to death , for they were afraid of the people . Judas Betrays Jesus . [ c ]
NCB	Luke	22	3	Then Satan entered into Judas , called Iscariot , who was one of the Twelve .
NCB	Luke	22	4	And he went to the chief priests and temple guards to discuss how he might betray Jesus to them
NCB	Luke	22	5	They were delighted and agreed to give him money .
NCB	Luke	22	6	He accepted their offer and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them when no crowd was present . The Last Supper [ d ] The Preparations for the Passover . [ e ] When the day of the feast of Unleavened Bread arrived , on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed ,
NCB	Luke	22	8	Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , “ Go and make the preparations for us to eat the Passover. ”
NCB	Luke	22	9	They asked him , “ Where do you want us to make the preparations ? ”
NCB	Luke	22	10	He replied , “ When you enter the city , a man will meet you carrying a jug of water . Follow him into the house that he enters
NCB	Luke	22	11	and say to the master of the house , ‘ The Teacher says this to you : “ Where is the room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples ? ” ’
NCB	Luke	22	12	) ; for Jesus , it prefigures the Messianic Banquet in which all human beings are reunited in the presence of God . All his hope for happiness becomes a promise for believers . - Luke 22:19 In a prophetic gesture Jesus proclaims and establishes the new covenant between God and humanity ( see Ex 24:8 ; Jer 31:31 ) , which he is preparing to seal by his freely accepted sacrifice . In this action , by changing the bread and wine into his body and blood ( see
NCB	Luke	22	13	They went forth and found everything just as he had told them , and they prepared the Passover .
NCB	Luke	22	14	The Last Supper . [ f ] When the hour came , Jesus took his place at table along with the apostles .
NCB	Luke	22	15	He said to them , “ I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer .
NCB	Luke	22	16	For I tell you that from this moment on I shall never eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. ”
NCB	Luke	22	17	Then he took a cup , and after giving thanks he said , “ Take this and share it among yourselves .
NCB	Luke	22	18	For I tell you that from this moment I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes. ”
NCB	Luke	22	19	Jesus Gives His Body and His Blood . [ g ] Then he took bread , and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them , saying , “ This is my body , which will be given for you . Do this in memory of me. ”
NCB	Luke	22	20	And he did the same with the cup after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which will be poured out for you .
NCB	Luke	22	21	The Betrayer Foretold . [ h ] “ But behold , the hand of the one who will betray me is here with me on the table .
NCB	Luke	22	23	Then they began to question among themselves as to which one of them might do this .
NCB	Luke	22	24	The Disciples Are To Serve on Earth . [ i ] Then a dispute also broke out among them as to which one of them should be considered the greatest .
NCB	Luke	22	25	Jesus said to them , “ The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them , and those who exercise authority over them are given the title of ‘ Benefactor. ’ [ j ]
NCB	Luke	22	26	“ But it must not be so with you . Rather , the greatest among you should be like the youngest , and the leader must be like the one who serves .
NCB	Luke	22	27	For who is greater—the one seated at table or the one who serves ? Surely , the one who sits at table . And yet I am in your midst as one who serves .
NCB	Luke	22	28	Judges of the Twelve Tribes . [ k ] “ You are the ones who have stood by my side in my trials ,
NCB	Luke	22	29	and now I confer on you a kingdom just as my Father has conferred one on me .
NCB	Luke	22	30	In my kingdom , you will eat and drink at my table , and you will sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . [ l ]
NCB	Luke	22	31	Peter ’ s Denial Foretold . [ m ] “ Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has desired to sift all of you like wheat .
NCB	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed that your own faith may not fail . And once you have turned back , you must strengthen your brethren. ”
NCB	Luke	22	33	Simon said to him , “ Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death. ”
NCB	Luke	22	34	Jesus replied , “ I tell you , Peter , before the cock crows today , you will deny three times that you know me. ”
NCB	Luke	22	35	Instructions for the Time of Crisis . [ n ] Then Jesus said to them , “ When I sent you forth without a money bag or sack or sandals , were you ever in need of anything ? ” They answered , “ No , not a thing. ”
NCB	Luke	22	36	He then remarked , “ But now , the one who has a money bag should take it with him , as well as a sack . And if you do not have a sword , sell your cloak and purchase one .
NCB	Luke	22	37	“ For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me : ‘ He was numbered with the wicked. ’ Indeed , everything written about me is being fulfilled. ”
NCB	Luke	22	38	They said , “ See , Lord , here are two swords. ” He said to them , “ That is enough. ” The Passion
NCB	Luke	22	39	The Agony in the Garden . [ o ] Jesus then went forth and made his way , as was his custom , to the Mount of Olives , and the disciples followed him .
NCB	Luke	22	40	When he reached the place , he said to them , “ Pray that you may not enter into temptation. ”
NCB	Luke	22	41	After withdrawing from them about a stone ’ s throw , he knelt down and prayed ,
NCB	Luke	22	42	saying , “ Father , if you are willing , take this cup from me . Yet not my will but yours be done. ”
NCB	Luke	22	43	[ p ] Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength .
NCB	Luke	22	44	In his anguish , he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like great drops of blood falling on the ground .
NCB	Luke	22	45	When he rose from prayer and returned to the disciples , he found them sleeping , exhausted by grief .
NCB	Luke	22	46	) . Along with Paul , Luke has preserved for us what is perhaps one of the earliest texts of the first Christian Eucharists . - Luke 22:21 The announcement of Judas ’ s plan stresses the initiative of Jesus , who does not deviate from his sacrifice . Celebrating the Eucharist , believers and the leaders of the community must question themselves concerning their loyalty toward the Lord . - Luke 22:24 To celebrate the Eucharist means to abandon one ’ s search for honor and to discover that all authority in the Christian community has no other title except that of service . - Luke 22:25 Benefactor : a term often used for leaders of pagan nations . - Luke 22:28 See note on Mt 19:27-30 . - Luke 22:30 The image , drawn from the Jewish tradition , signifies a privileged share in the glory of the Messiah . - Luke 22:31 It is not in the quality of her human leaders but in the prayer of Jesus that the Church finds the assurance of perseverance in the faith . - Luke 22:35 A time of happiness is ending . Henceforth , the Church must confront trials . And she must not think of defending herself with the weapons employed by societies to achieve their freedom or ensure their interests . - Luke 22:39 Tempted to refuse the terrible and humiliating trial of the cross , Jesus struggles in prayer to accept the will of the Father . The divine aid that he receives , as once Elijah did ( see
NCB	Luke	22	47	Jesus Is Betrayed and Arrested . [ q ] While he was still speaking , a crowd of men suddenly approached , and the one called Judas , one of the Twelve , was leading them . He came up to Jesus to kiss him ,
NCB	Luke	22	48	but Jesus said , “ Judas , would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss ? ”
NCB	Luke	22	49	When Jesus ’ disciples realized what was about to happen , they asked , “ Lord , should we strike with our swords ? ”
NCB	Luke	22	50	And one of them struck a servant of the high priest , slicing off his right ear .
NCB	Luke	22	51	But Jesus said , “ Stop ! No more of this ! ” He then touched the servant ’ s ear and healed him .
NCB	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests , the officers of the temple guard , and the elders who had come for him , “ Why are you coming forth with swords and clubs as though I were a bandit ?
NCB	Luke	22	53	When I was with you day after day in the temple , you did not raise a hand against me . But this is the hour for you and the power of darkness. ” [ r ]
NCB	Luke	22	54	Peter Denies Jesus . [ s ] Then they arrested Jesus and led him away . They brought him into the house of the high priest , and Peter followed at a distance .
NCB	Luke	22	55	Lighting a fire in the middle of the courtyard , they sat around it , and Peter sat with them .
NCB	Luke	22	56	A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire , looked closely at him , and said , “ This man also was with him. ”
NCB	Luke	22	57	But he denied it , saying , “ Woman , I do not know him. ”
NCB	Luke	22	58	A short time later , someone else saw him and said , “ You too are one of them , ” but Peter replied , “ No , I am not. ”
NCB	Luke	22	59	About an hour later , another person strongly insisted , “ This man was unquestionably with him , for he is a Galilean. ”
NCB	Luke	22	60	Peter said , “ My friend , I do not know what you are talking about. ” At that very moment , while he was still speaking , a cock crowed ,
NCB	Luke	22	61	) . Note how Luke does not emphasize the crescendo of the denials . Rather , he attenuates them , and moreover does not speak of curses and oaths . - Luke 22:66 In contrast to Matthew and Mark , Luke does not mention the false testimonies brought against Jesus . In any case , the authorities have resolved to put him to death and seek only to have their decision confirmed . Jesus speaks solemnly about his mission and his person . He is the Envoy of God , united with him in a very particular way , and his kingdom will be inaugurated henceforth , from his Resurrection ( v.
NCB	Luke	22	62	And he went out and wept uncontrollably .
NCB	Luke	22	63	The men who were guarding Jesus began to mock him and to beat him .
NCB	Luke	22	64	They also blindfolded him and kept asking him , “ Prophesy ! Who hit you ? ”
NCB	Luke	22	65	And they continued to taunt him with insult after insult .
NCB	Luke	22	66	Jesus before the Sanhedrin . [ t ] When the dawn came , the council of the elders of the people , both the chief priests and the scribes , assembled , and they brought him before their Sanhedrin . [ u ]
NCB	Luke	22	67	Then they said , “ If you are the Christ , tell us ! ” He replied , “ If I tell you , you will not believe ;
NCB	Luke	22	68	and if I question you , you will not answer .
NCB	Luke	22	69	; Ps 110:1 ; Dan 7:13 ) . - Luke 22:66 Sanhedrin : see note on Mk 14:55 .
NCB	Luke	22	70	All of them asked , “ Are you then the Son of God ? ” He replied , “ It is you who say that I am. ”
NCB	Luke	22	71	Then they said , “ What need do we have for any further testimony ? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips. ” Footnotes - Luke 22:1 The salvation of human beings is accomplished in a unique event : Christ ’ s Death and Resurrection . This is the Paschal mystery . The account that follows is fashioned by this principal testimony ; hence it must be read as a unified whole . From the beginnings of the Church , this is the Gospel , the essence of the Christian announcement . - Luke 22:1 Before the episodes of the Passion unfold , the plot thickens with the adversaries of Jesus . The leaders of the people take the initiative in the plot , and the traitor serves them as an instrument , but it is the spirit of evil who initiates the last combat . - Luke 22:3 See note on Mt 26:14-16 . - Luke 22:7 Now we see the initiative of Jesus , which appears so clearly in this last supper . The account is an integral part of the Passion , i.e. , the Death and Resurrection of Jesus , for the Church that announces the Gospel of Christ the Savior is also the Christian community that celebrates the Eucharist , the memorial of salvation . Jesus enters the decisive event ; this last act is , as it were , the summary of his every act and word : sharing , offering , gift , presence , and covenant of God in the midst of his followers .
NCB	Luke	22	7	Luke has placed actions and words of Jesus here that the other evangelists report in other contexts . This is so the community can meditate on them each time it assembles to break the bread of the Lord . He thus leaves us a liturgical rule ( the text of the Eucharistic institution ) and , connected with it , communitary and missionary directives . - Luke 22:7 Jesus takes the initiative , freely and fully , for this last Passover of the old covenant , this repast that inaugurates a new covenant . - Luke 22:14 For the Jews , the Passover is the memorial of the liberation of the people ( see Ex
NCB	Luke	23	23	However , with loud shouts they continued to insist that he should be crucified , and their voices prevailed .
NCB	Luke	23	1	Then the entire assembly rose and brought Jesus before Pilate .
NCB	Luke	23	2	They began to accuse him , saying , “ We charge this man with subverting our nation , opposing the payment of taxes to Caesar , and claiming that he is the Christ , a king. ”
NCB	Luke	23	3	Pilate asked him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” He replied , “ You have said so. ”
NCB	Luke	23	4	Pilate then said to the chief priests and the crowds , “ I find no evidence of a crime in this man. ”
NCB	Luke	23	5	But they continued to insist , saying , “ He is stirring up the people by his teaching throughout all Judea , from Galilee , where he started , all the way to here. ”

NCB	Luke	23	7	and upon learning that he came under Herod ’ s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem at that time . Jesus before Herod . [ b ]
NCB	Luke	23	8	Herod was delighted when he saw Jesus , for he had heard about him and had been hoping for some time to see him and perhaps to witness him perform some sign .
NCB	Luke	23	9	He questioned him at length , but Jesus gave him no reply .
NCB	Luke	23	10	The chief priests and the scribes meanwhile were present , and they vehemently made accusations against him .
NCB	Luke	23	11	Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him . Then Herod had him clothed in an elegant robe and sent him back to Pilate .
NCB	Luke	23	12	That very day Herod and Pilate became friends , although previously they had been enemies .
NCB	Luke	23	13	Jesus before Pilate Again . [ c ] Pilate then summoned the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
NCB	Luke	23	14	and said to them , “ You brought this man before me and accused him of inciting the people to rebellion . I have examined him here in your presence and have not found him guilty of any of the charges you have brought against him .
NCB	Luke	23	15	Nor did Herod , for he has sent him back to us . It is clear that he has done nothing deserving of death .
NCB	Luke	23	16	Therefore , I will have him scourged and then release him. ” Jesus Is Condemned to Death . [
NCB	Luke	23	17	Now Pilate was obliged to release one man to them at the time of the festival . ] [ d ]
NCB	Luke	23	18	And then the crowd all shouted in unison , “ Away with this man ! Release Barabbas to us ! ”
NCB	Luke	23	19	( He had been imprisoned for an insurrection that had occurred in the city as well as for murder . )
NCB	Luke	23	20	In his desire to release Jesus , Pilate again pleaded with them ,
NCB	Luke	23	21	but , they continued to shout , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ”
NCB	Luke	23	22	and reports verse
NCB	Luke	23	24	Pilate ordered that what they wanted was to be granted .
NCB	Luke	23	25	He released the man they asked for , who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder , and he handed over Jesus to them to deal with as they wished .
NCB	Luke	23	26	The Way of the Cross . [ e ] As they led him away , they seized a man from Cyrene named Simon , who was returning from the country . They put the cross on his back and forced him to carry it behind Jesus .
NCB	Luke	23	27	A large number of people followed Jesus , among them many women who were mourning and lamenting over him .
NCB	Luke	23	28	But he turned to them and said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me . Weep rather for yourselves and for your children .
NCB	Luke	23	29	For behold , the days are coming when people will say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore children and the breasts that never nursed. ’
NCB	Luke	23	30	Then they will begin to say to the mountains , ‘ Fall on us ! ’ and to the hills , ‘ Cover us ! ’
NCB	Luke	23	31	, the prayer that the rabbis were wont to recite in the evening and that is still recited today at Night Prayer in the Liturgy of the Hours . - Luke 23:48 To the confession of the centurion , Luke adds that of the crowds , who had assisted in silence at the drama of the crucifixion . The centurion symbolizes the Roman world that recognizes the innocence and transcendental dignity of Christ , while the crowds indicate the rejection on the part of the chosen people . - Luke 23:50 The burial of Jesus , a human gesture , must be accomplished before the rise of the evening star or before the lights are lit for the evening , for then the Sabbath will have arrived—when all work is prohibited . - Luke 23:50 Man named Joseph : Luke shows the goodness of Joseph of Arimathea . At the same time , he shows that not every member of the Sanhedrin voted to condemn Jesus .
NCB	Luke	23	32	Jesus Is Crucified . [ f ] There were also two others , both criminals , who were led away to be executed with him .
NCB	Luke	23	33	When they came to the place called The Skull , they crucified [ g ] Jesus there along with the two criminals , one on his right and the other on his left .
NCB	Luke	23	34	Then Jesus said , “ Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing. ” [ h ] And they cast lots to divide his garments .
NCB	Luke	23	35	The people stood there watching . [ i ] Meanwhile , the rulers jeered at him and said , “ He saved others . Let him save himself if he is the Christ of God , the Chosen One. ”
NCB	Luke	23	36	Even the soldiers mocked him . As they came forward to offer him sour wine ,
NCB	Luke	23	37	they said , “ If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself ! ”
NCB	Luke	23	38	There was also an inscription above his head that said , “ This is the King of the Jews. ”
NCB	Luke	23	39	One of the criminals hanging there taunted Jesus , saying , “ Are you not the Christ ? Save yourself and us ! ”
NCB	Luke	23	40	But the other rebuked him , “ Have you no fear of God , since you are under the same sentence ?
NCB	Luke	23	41	In our case , we have been condemned justly , for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds . But this man has committed no wrong. ”
NCB	Luke	23	42	Then he said , “ Jesus , remember me when you come into your kingdom. ”
NCB	Luke	23	43	Jesus said to him , “ Amen , I say to you , today you will be with me in Paradise. ” [ j ]
NCB	Luke	23	44	Jesus Dies on the Cross . [ k ] It was now about noon , and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon ,
NCB	Luke	23	45	for the sun was darkened . Then the veil of the temple was torn in two .
NCB	Luke	23	46	He cried out , “ Father , into your hands I commend my spirit. ” And with these words he breathed his last . [ l ]
NCB	Luke	23	47	On seeing what had taken place , the centurion praised God and said , “ Surely , this man was innocent. ”
NCB	Luke	23	48	When all the people who had gathered there to witness the spectacle saw what had happened , they returned home beating their breasts . [ m ]
NCB	Luke	23	49	However , all his acquaintances , including the women who had followed him from Galilee , stood at a distance and watched all these events .
NCB	Luke	23	50	Jesus Is Buried . [ n ] Now there was a good and upright man named Joseph [ o ] who was a member of the council .
NCB	Luke	23	51	However , he had not agreed to their plan and the action they had taken . He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea , and he was awaiting the kingdom of God .
NCB	Luke	23	52	This man went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus .
NCB	Luke	23	53	Then he took it down , wrapped it in a linen shroud , and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of rock in which no one had ever been interred .
NCB	Luke	23	54	It was the Day of Preparation , and the Sabbath was about to begin .
NCB	Luke	23	55	The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph . They saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it .
NCB	Luke	23	56	Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments . But on the Sabbath they rested in obedience to the commandment . Footnotes - Luke 23:1 The Roman governor , who usually resided at Caesarea in Palestine , was in the religious capital at the time when the Passover was being celebrated . The religious leaders accuse Jesus before him as the civil power . Twisting the reality ( see Lk 21:20-26 ) , they invent political wrongs so as to have Jesus put to death . From the beginning the Roman governor is convinced of Jesus ’ innocence , and he would prefer to extricate himself from this case and give it to others , for it could create nothing but trouble for him with the people and the leaders . - Luke 23:8 Also present in Jerusalem was Herod Antipas , ruler of Galilee , a man interested in extraordinary phenomena , ready to be scornful of them , and unwilling to accept any responsibility ( see Lk 9:9 ; Acts 4:27 ) . - Luke 23:13 Pilate is convinced that the accused is innocent . But he proposes to punish him so that the authorities might have the impression of having been heard . Finally , he yields to violence . Luke emphasizes above all the decisive responsibility of the leaders of the people . See notes on Mt 27:11-26 ; 27:11 ; 27:14 ; 27:24 ; 27:25 . - Luke 23:17 Many manuscripts add this verse , probably taken from Mt 27:15 or Mk 15:6 . - Luke 23:26 In place of solitude , Luke speaks of numerous people who take pity on Jesus ; the people are already distancing themselves from the ignoble decision of their leaders . This recalls the conversion announced by the prophet Zechariah ( Zec 12:10-14 ) . But Jesus is haunted by a sorrowful vision : the ruin of Jerusalem and the official religion in which the Word of God has no effect . See also note on Mk 15:21 . - Luke 23:32 Jesus is placed in the ranks of evildoers . He is stripped of his clothes and vinegar is presented to him , fulfilling Psalms 22:19 and 69:22 before our very eyes . The people are silent . The leaders make fun of a Messiah who wishes to save human beings . The soldiers deride his royal title , the reason for his condemnation well affixed to the wood of the cross . This apparently humiliated king testifies to a true royalty by the unheard-of love that he gives : he asks for pardon of his killers and welcomes into his kingdom the thief who repents . See also note on Mt 27:35 . - Luke 23:33 Crucified : see note on Mt 27:35 . - Luke 23:34 This is the first word uttered by Jesus from the cross , reported only by Luke , the evangelist of mercy and meekness . Its authenticity is seemingly not open to doubt even though it is omitted in numerous codices written in an anti-Semitic age . - Luke 23:35 Stood there watching : Luke , the friend of the crowds , does not include the people with those leaders who insulted the Crucified . They are there to watch . - Luke 23:43 This is the second word of the crucified Jesus , also reported only by Luke , and it concludes with the pardon of the good thief . Thus , salvation flows from the cross . - Luke 23:44 The crucified Just One expires and everything bears testimony in his behalf : a prayer of complete trust rises to his lips , a pagan acknowledges his innocence , the people already manifest their repentance ( see Zec 12:10 ) , and his dear ones are nearby . Is this a tableau of desolation ? Yet a mysterious expectation grips us . - Luke 23:46 Luke omits the word of abandonment found in Matthew and Mark . Instead , Jesus dies as the prototypical good person , who at the end of his life commends his spirit into the hands of the Father . Luke leaves aside the citation from Psalm
NCB	Luke	24	24	Some of our companions went to the tomb and found everything exactly as the women had said , but they did not see him. ”
NCB	Luke	24	1	Cor 15:5 ) . - Luke 24:36 It is truly the Lord who is present , the one whom they have known and seen die . He therefore has truly risen ! But nothing is as it was before : his presence is not explained ; it merely attests , by its reality , that salvation is given , that death and sin are vanquished . Now the disciples realize that the salvation announced in a mysterious fashion by the Old Testament is accomplished in Jesus . And the Risen Lord charges them to proclaim it everywhere , to teach people about it by their testimony and by the power of the Spirit of Pentecost . This passage contains , in summary form , an entire model for Christian preaching : the fulfillment of the Scriptures and of God ’ s plan , the proclamation of forgiveness and conversion , the call to faith and holiness . The Book of Acts will tell how the Church carried out this mission . - Luke 24:50 Recognized and worshiped as Lord by his disciples , Jesus is taken away from our world . The Gospel of Luke ends with this vision , which the Acts of the Apostles situates forty days later ( Acts 1:2-3 , 9-11 ) . Regardless of the date and the unfolding , the event surpasses history and time ; after his resurrection , Jesus is established in his dignity of the Son of God . Henceforth , we live on earth in the time of praise and bearing witness .
NCB	Luke	24	2	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb ,
NCB	Luke	24	3	but when they went inside , they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus .
NCB	Luke	24	4	While they stood there wondering about this , suddenly two men in dazzling clothes appeared at their side .
NCB	Luke	24	5	They were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground , but the men said to them , “ Why do you look among the dead for one who is alive ?
NCB	Luke	24	6	He is not here . He has been raised . Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee :
NCB	Luke	24	7	that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified and rise again on the third day. ”
NCB	Luke	24	8	Then they recalled his words .
NCB	Luke	24	9	When they returned from the tomb , they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others .
NCB	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene , Joanna , Mary the mother of James , and the other women with them who told this to the apostles .
NCB	Luke	24	11	However , this story of theirs seemed to be nonsense , and the apostles did not believe them .
NCB	Luke	24	12	Nonetheless , Peter got up and ran to the tomb . Bending over , he looked inside and saw only the linen cloths . Then he returned home , wondering what had occurred .
NCB	Luke	24	13	Jesus Appears to Two Disciples at Emmaus . [ b ] Now that same day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus , about seven miles from Jerusalem ,
NCB	Luke	24	14	and they were talking with each other about all these things that had occurred .
NCB	Luke	24	15	While they were conversing and discussing these events , Jesus himself drew near and walked along with them ,
NCB	Luke	24	16	but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him .
NCB	Luke	24	17	He asked them , “ What are you discussing with each other as you walk along ? ” They stood still , their faces filled with sadness .
NCB	Luke	24	18	Then one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answered him , “ Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who is not aware of all the things that have taken place there in these days ? ”
NCB	Luke	24	19	When he asked , “ What things ? ” they replied , “ The things that happened to Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet powerful in word and deed before God and all the people ,
NCB	Luke	24	20	and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death and had him crucified .
NCB	Luke	24	21	“ We had been hoping that he would be the one who would redeem Israel . And what is more , this is the third day since all of this took place .
NCB	Luke	24	22	Some women from our group have now given us astounding news . They went to the tomb early this morning ,
NCB	Luke	24	23	but they failed to find his body . When they returned , they told us that they had seen a vision of angels who reported that he was alive .
NCB	Luke	24	25	Then he said to them , “ How foolish you are , and how slow to believe all that the Prophets have spoken !
NCB	Luke	24	26	Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory ? ”
NCB	Luke	24	27	Then , beginning with Moses and going through all the Prophets , he interpreted for them all the passages from the Scriptures that pertained to him .
NCB	Luke	24	28	As they approached the village to which they were going , he acted as though he would be going further .
NCB	Luke	24	29	However , they urged him strongly , “ Stay with us , for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over. ” And so he went in to stay with them .
NCB	Luke	24	30	When he was at table with them , he took bread , blessed and broke it , and gave it to them .
NCB	Luke	24	31	Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him , but he vanished from their sight .
NCB	Luke	24	32	They said to each other , “ Were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us ? ”
NCB	Luke	24	33	They set out immediately and returned to Jerusalem , where they found gathered together the Eleven and their companions
NCB	Luke	24	34	who were saying , “ The Lord has truly been raised , and he has appeared to Simon ! ” [ c ]
NCB	Luke	24	35	Then the two described what had happened on their journey and how he had made himself known to them in the breaking of the bread .
NCB	Luke	24	36	Jesus Appears to the Disciples in Jerusalem . [ d ] While they were still conversing about this , Jesus himself stood in their midst and said to them , “ Peace be with you. ”
NCB	Luke	24	37	Startled and terrified , they thought that they were seeing a ghost .
NCB	Luke	24	38	He said to them , “ Why are you troubled , and why are doubts arising in your hearts ?
NCB	Luke	24	39	Look at my hands and my feet . It is I myself . Touch me and see . For a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see that I have. ”
NCB	Luke	24	40	And when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet .
NCB	Luke	24	41	In spite of their joy and amazement , they were still incredulous . So he said to them , “ Do you have anything here to eat ? ”
NCB	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of fish ,
NCB	Luke	24	43	and he took it and ate it in their presence .
NCB	Luke	24	44	Then he said to them , “ This is what I meant when I told you while I was still with you : Everything written about me in the Law of Moses , the Prophets , and the Psalms must be fulfilled. ”
NCB	Luke	24	45	Thereupon , he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures .
NCB	Luke	24	46	And he said to them , “ Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise from the dead ,
NCB	Luke	24	47	and that in his name repentance and forgiveness of sins are to be proclaimed to all nations , beginning from Jerusalem .
NCB	Luke	24	48	You are witnesses to all these things .
NCB	Luke	24	49	“ And behold , I am sending upon you the gift promised by my Father . Therefore , stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high. ”
NCB	Luke	24	50	Jesus Ascends to Heaven . [ e ] Then he led them out as far as Bethany , and lifting up his hands he blessed them .
NCB	Luke	24	51	While he was blessing them , he departed from them and was taken up to heaven .
NCB	Luke	24	52	They worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy ,
NCB	Luke	24	53	and they were continually in the temple praising God . Footnotes - Luke 24:1 The man who was thought to have been buried forever receives the important title “ the Living One , ” a title that the Old Testament reserves to the Lord ( see Jos 3:10 ; Jdg 8:19 ; Rev 1:18 ) , and the hearts of the witnesses are opened to the Word of God . This is the first Christian Sunday , the Lord ’ s Day , the new day ( v.
NCB	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
NCB	John	1	2	He was with God in the very beginning .
NCB	John	1	3	Through him all things came into existence , and without him there was nothing . That which came to be
NCB	John	1	4	found life in him , and the life was the light of the human race .
NCB	John	1	5	The light shines in the darkness , and the darkness has been unable to overcome it . Faith Means Welcoming the Word of God Made Man . [ d ]
NCB	John	1	6	A man appeared , sent by God , whose name was John . [ e ]
NCB	John	1	7	He came as a witness to give testimony to the light , so that through him all might come to believe .
NCB	John	1	8	He himself was not the light ; his role was to bear witness to the light .
NCB	John	1	9	The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world .
NCB	John	1	10	He was in the world , the world had come into existence through him , yet the world did not recognize him .
NCB	John	1	11	He came to his own , but his own did not accept him .
NCB	John	1	12	However , to those who did accept him and who believed in his name he granted the power to become children of God ,
NCB	John	1	13	times and is commonly associated with themes of crucifixion and suffering ( Jn 3:14 ; 8:28 ) and revelation ( Jn 6:27 ,
NCB	John	1	14	And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us . And we saw his glory , the glory as of the Father ’ s only Son , full of grace and truth .
NCB	John	1	15	Jesus Christ , Fullness of Truth . [ f ] John testified to him , proclaiming , “ This is the one of whom I said , ‘ The one who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me. ’ ”
NCB	John	1	16	From his fullness we have all received , grace upon grace .
NCB	John	1	17	For the Law was given through Moses , but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ .
NCB	John	1	18	, the one like Moses ( see Acts 3:22 ) , who was expected to be the Messiah and repeat the prodigies of the Exodus . - John 1:29 John knows that he acts as a prophet gripped by the mission of God . And at the threshold of the Gospel , he presents the image of the lamb who will be evoked again at the end of the Passion . It is connected with the Jewish Passover and symbolizes the deliverance from Egypt ( Ex 12:1-28 ) ; it also fits in with the portrait of the mysterious Servant of God , foretold by a prophet as an innocent victim led like a lamb to the slaughter , who was not only to atone for the sins of humanity but also to justify sinners ( Isa 53:7 , 11-12 ) . It further recalls the great apocalyptic Lamb who would destroy evil in the world ( Rev 5–7 ; 17:14 ) . - John 1:31 I myself did not know him : this may refer to the fact that John lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel ( see Lk 1:80 ) and thus did not know Jesus very well . It may also indicate that John did not know that Jesus was the Messiah until he saw the sign mentioned in vv . 32-33 . - John 1:32 For Jesus ’ Baptism , see notes on Mt 3:13-17 ; 3:15 ; 3:17 . - John 1:33 The one who is to baptize with the Holy Spirit : John baptized with water , but Jesus would baptize with the Holy Spirit . We can see in this a reference to the sending of the Holy Spirit . In this Gospel that occurs on Easter Sunday ( Jn 20:22 ) . - John 1:35 The movement of Jesus is separated from the movement of the Baptist . In the very first encounter , Jesus wins over Andrew , and perhaps the disciple who is not named was the beloved disciple , sufficiently interested in Andrew ’ s call to still remember the hour ( v.
NCB	John	1	19	John the Baptist Is Not the Messiah . [ h ] This is the testimony offered by John when the Jews [ i ] sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , “ Who are you ? ”
NCB	John	1	20	He confessed , he did not deny , but confessed , “ I am not the Christ. ” [ j ]
NCB	John	1	21	Then they asked him , “ Who then are you ? Are you Elijah ? ” [ k ] He said , “ I am not. ” “ Are you the Prophet ? ” He answered , “ No. ”
NCB	John	1	22	Therefore , they said to him , “ Who are you , so we may have an answer to give to those who sent us ? What do you have to say about yourself ? ”
NCB	John	1	23	He replied , in the words of the prophet Isaiah , “ I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness , ‘ Make straight the way of the Lord. ’ ”
NCB	John	1	24	Some Pharisees were present in this group ,
NCB	John	1	25	and they asked him , “ Why then are you baptizing if you are neither the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the Prophet ? ”
NCB	John	1	26	John answered them , “ I baptize with water ; but among you there is one whom you do not know ,
NCB	John	1	27	the one who is coming after me . I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal. ”
NCB	John	1	28	This took place in Bethany , beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing .
NCB	John	1	29	Behold , the Lamb of God , Who Takes Away the Sin of the World . [ l ] The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him , and he said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world .
NCB	John	1	30	This is the one of whom I said , ‘ After me is coming one who ranks ahead of me because he existed before me. ’
NCB	John	1	31	I myself did not know him , [ m ] but the reason I came to baptize with water was so that he might be revealed to Israel. ”
NCB	John	1	32	John also gave this testimony , saying , “ I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it came to rest on him . [ n ]
NCB	John	1	33	I myself did not know him , but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me , ‘ The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is the one who is to baptize with the Holy Spirit. ’ [ o ]
NCB	John	1	34	And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God. ”
NCB	John	1	35	We Have Found the Messiah . [ p ] The next day John was standing there with two of his disciples ,
NCB	John	1	36	and as he watched Jesus pass by , he said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God. ”
NCB	John	1	37	On hearing him say this , the two disciples began to follow Jesus .
NCB	John	1	38	When Jesus turned and saw them following him , he asked them , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said to him , “ Rabbi ” ( which , translated , is “ Teacher ” ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
NCB	John	1	39	) . Jesus gives Simon a new name indicative of his future mission ( see Mt 16:18 ) ; with authority he calls Philip , and he reads the heart of Nathanael . In this man so unexpected because of his lowly origin ( v.
NCB	John	1	40	One of the two who had heard John speak and had followed Jesus was Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter .
NCB	John	1	41	The first thing Andrew did was to seek out his brother Simon and say to him , “ We have found the Messiah ” [ r ] ( which , translated , is “ Christ ” ) ,
NCB	John	1	42	and he took him to Jesus . Jesus gazed at him and said , “ You are Simon son of John . You will be called Cephas ” [ s ] ( which , translated , is “ Peter ” ) .
NCB	John	1	43	The next day Jesus [ t ] decided to go to Galilee . Encountering Philip , he said to him , “ Follow me. ”
NCB	John	1	44	Philip came from the same town , Bethsaida , [ u ] as Andrew and Peter .
NCB	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael [ v ] and said to him , “ We have found the one about whom Moses in the Law and also the Prophets wrote—Jesus the son of Joseph , from Nazareth. ”
NCB	John	1	46	) , the disciples recognize the Messiah Israel expected . And Jesus unveils to them his mystery : Messiah of Israel , he is also the Son of Man who reunites heaven and earth in his kingdom . He is the sole mediator who gives access to the Father , as indicated in v.
NCB	John	1	47	When Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him , he said of him , “ Behold , a true Israelite , in whom there is no deception. ” [ w ]
NCB	John	1	48	Nathanael asked him , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered him , “ Before Philip summoned you , when you were under the fig tree , [ x ] I saw you. ”
NCB	John	1	49	Nathanael said to him , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God . You are the King of Israel. ”
NCB	John	1	50	Jesus responded , “ Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree ? You will see greater things than that. ”
NCB	John	1	51	, an allusion to the dream of Jacob ( see Gen 28:12 ) . The Gospel then offers us a meditation on the free gift and the happiness of being called by Jesus , a charter of the spiritual life . The dialogue with the first disciples lets us understand where Jesus leads those who follow him : there where he dwells at the side of the Father ( see Jn 1:18 ) . Intimacy with Christ , shared knowledge , and faith are the principal traits that describe the life of disciples . The Church must be the community where people share the certainty and the joy of having encountered Christ . - John 1:39 Four o ’ clock in the afternoon : literally , “ the tenth hour ” ( from sunrise : 6:00 A.M. ) in the Roman method of telling time . - John 1:41 Messiah : Greek transliteration of the Hebrew word for “ Anointed One , ” which is used only here and in Jn 4:25 in this Gospel . The Greek translation Christos ( “ Christ ” ) appears everywhere else . - John 1:42 Cephas in Aramaic signifies “ stone , rock ” ( see Mt 16:18 ) . It was not used at that time as a personal name . Peter : i.e. , Petros , the Greek equivalent of Cephas . - John 1:43 Jesus : literally , “ he , ” which could also refer to Peter . - John 1:44 Bethsaida : on the northern shore of Lake Tiberias . - John 1:45 Nathanael was certainly the apostle Bartholomew ; see Mt 10:3 . - John 1:47 A true Israelite , in whom there is no deception : this phrase recalls the fact that Jacob was the first to bear the name “ Israel ” ( Gen 32:29 ) , but he was an “ Israelite ” in whom there was deception ( Gen 27:35-36 ) . - John 1:48 Under the fig tree : a phrase signifying Messianic peace ( see Mic 4:4 ; Zec 3:10 ) . - John 1:51 Son of Man : see note on Mt 8:20 for the use of this term in the New Testament . In John , it occurs
NCB	John	1	70	times in the fourth Gospel—sometimes in a favorable sense ( Jn 4:20 ) , others in a neutral sense , but most often in a pejorative sense referring to the leaders of the Jews who were hostile to Jesus ( Jn 8:48 , etc. ) . Here it means the delegation sent by the Sanhedrin to assess the activities of an unauthorized teacher . - John 1:20 Christ : the Messiah , the anointed vicegerent of the Lord , usually regarded as the heir of David . - John 1:21 Elijah : this prophet who had been carried away to heaven in a fiery chariot was expected to return to earth to announce the end time . The Prophet : i.e. , the Prophet mentioned in Deut 18:15 ,
NCB	John	1	53	) as well as eschatological authority ( Jn 5:27 ; 9:39 ) .
NCB	John	2	2	and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited .
NCB	John	2	1	On the third day , there was a wedding at Cana [ b ] in Galilee . The mother of Jesus was there ,
NCB	John	2	3	When the wine was exhausted , the mother of Jesus said to him , “ They have no wine. ”
NCB	John	2	4	Jesus responded , “ Woman , [ c ] what concern is this to us ? My hour has not yet come. ”
NCB	John	2	5	His mother said to the servants , “ Do whatever he tells you. ”
NCB	John	2	6	Now standing nearby there were six stone water jars , of the type used for Jewish rites of purification , each holding twenty to thirty gallons .
NCB	John	2	7	Jesus instructed the servants , “ Fill the jars with water. ” When they had filled them to the brim ,
NCB	John	2	8	he ordered them , “ Now draw some out and take it to the chief steward , ” and they did so .
NCB	John	2	9	When the chief steward tasted the water that had become wine , he did not know where it came from , although the servants who had drawn the water knew . The chief steward called over the bridegroom
NCB	John	2	10	and said , “ Everyone serves the choice wine first , and then an inferior vintage when the guests have been drinking for a while . However , you have saved the best wine until now. ” [ d ]
NCB	John	2	11	Jesus performed this , the first of his signs , [ e ] at Cana in Galilee , thereby revealing his glory , and his disciples believed in him .
NCB	John	2	12	After this , he went down to Capernaum with his mother , his brethren , [ f ] and his disciples , and they remained there for a few days . Worship of the Father in Spirit and Truth [ g ] The Mystery of the New Temple Jesus Casts the Merchants Out of the Temple . [ h ]
NCB	John	2	13	When the time of the Passover of the Jews was near , Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
NCB	John	2	14	In the temple he found people selling cattle , sheep , and doves , as well as money changers seated at their tables .
NCB	John	2	15	Making a whip of cords , he drove them all out of the temple , including the sheep and the cattle . He also overturned the tables of the money changers , scattering their coins ,
NCB	John	2	16	and to those who were selling the doves he ordered , “ Take them out of here ! Stop turning my Father ’ s house into a marketplace ! ”
NCB	John	2	17	His disciples recalled the words of Scripture , “ Zeal for your house will consume me. ”
NCB	John	2	18	The Jews then challenged him , “ What sign can you show us to justify your doing this ? ”
NCB	John	2	19	Jesus answered , “ Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up. ”
NCB	John	2	20	, then , we are in the year A.D. 27–28 . - John 2:23 To be filled with wonder at what Jesus can do , as was Nicodemus , is not yet faith . Faith is acceptance of the testimony of Jesus about God and about the plan of Jesus . Faith is another life , a transformed existence . The flesh—i.e. , we with our material and intellectual possibilities—does not have the power to transform our life . This transformation comes like the wind—mysterious and surprising—the same word in Hebrew and Greek expressing spirit and wind . The idea here is to bring to mind an event ( rebirth ) in which God alone has the initiative . Only those who open themselves to the Spirit , those who want to be reborn in Baptism and transformed as children of God , can believe in the new life that Jesus reveals and whose source is the Spirit—for they live it as by a gift .
NCB	John	2	21	But the temple he was talking about was the temple of his body .
NCB	John	2	22	After he had risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken . The Mystery of the New Covenant
NCB	John	2	23	Jesus in Jerusalem . [ i ] While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover , many people saw the signs he was performing and came to believe in his name .
NCB	John	2	24	However , Jesus would not entrust himself to them because he fully understood them all .
NCB	John	2	25	He did not need evidence from others about man , for he clearly understood men . Footnotes - John 2:1 The evangelist calls special attention to the presence of the Mother of Jesus . Her role is to call Jesus to the cross and then stand by him in his Passion ( Jn 19:25-26 ) . - John 2:1 Cana was five miles northeast of Nazareth . - John 2:4 Woman : a universal address from son to mother ; it is used again in Jn 19:26 , where its meaning becomes evident : Mary is the new Eve , mother of the living ( Gen 3:15 ,
NCB	John	2	27	; 13:1 ; 17:1 ; 19:27 ) . It is determined by the Father and can not be anticipated . The miracle worked at Mary ’ s intercession is a prophetic symbol of it . - John 2:10 The first wine represents the first Covenant , the second better wine represents the New Covenant . Jesus is prefiguring the Messianic banquet . - John 2:11 Signs : a term used by John to indicate Jesus ’ miracles , emphasizing the significance rather than the marvelous character of the event ( see Jn 4:54 ; 6:14 ; 9:16 ; 11:47 ) . These signs reveal Jesus ’ glory ( Jn 1:14 , Isa 35:1-2 ; Joel 4:18 ; Am 9:13 ) . - John 2:12 Brethren : that is , his close relatives . See notes on Mt 12:46-50 and 12:47 . - John 2:13 The author of the fourth Gospel brings us from one Jewish feast to another ; he seems to want to make them the points of reference with which to link the discourses of Jesus . The incidents that follow are therefore connected with the feast of Passover . They attest that Jesus has come to establish a new and spiritual worship that is no longer reserved to a single people or to a place . - John 2:13 Passover is the feast of Unleavened Bread , a sign of renewal ( see Ex 12:15 ) . Jesus knows , better than the Prophets ( Isa 1:11 ; Jer 7:4 ; Am 5:21 ) , that his Father has nothing to do with this traffic in sacrifices and offerings , if the interior gift of the heart is lacking . In fact , in the evangelist ’ s view , this temple of stone has already lost its function , and the true dwelling of the Father among human beings will be the humanity of the risen Jesus , who is the focal point of all worship . The construction of the new temple in Jerusalem had been begun by Herod the Great in 20–19 B.C . According to v.
NCB	John	3	3	Jesus replied , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , no one can see the kingdom of God [ b ] without being born from above. ”
NCB	John	3	1	There was a man from the Pharisees named Nicodemus , [ a ] a member of the Jewish ruling council ,
NCB	John	3	2	who came to Jesus at night . “ Rabbi , ” he said , “ we know that you are a teacher who has come from God , for no one would be able to perform the signs that you do unless God were with him. ”
NCB	John	3	4	Nicodemus asked , “ How can a man be born again once he is old ? Is it possible for him to enter a second time into his mother ’ s womb and be born ? ”
NCB	John	3	5	Jesus said , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit . [ c ]
NCB	John	3	6	What is born of the flesh is flesh , and what is born of the Spirit is spirit .
NCB	John	3	7	“ You should not be astonished when I say , ‘ You must be born from above. ’
NCB	John	3	8	The wind blows where it chooses , and you hear the sound of it , but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes . So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. ”
NCB	John	3	9	“ How is this possible ? ” asked Nicodemus .
NCB	John	3	10	Jesus responded , “ You are a teacher of Israel and you do not know these things ?
NCB	John	3	11	“ Amen , amen , I say to you , we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen , and yet you do not accept our testimony .
NCB	John	3	12	If I tell you about earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe when I speak to you about heavenly things ? Jesus Christ , Savior and Judge [ d ]
NCB	John	3	13	“ No one has gone up to heaven except the one who descended from heaven , the Son of Man .
NCB	John	3	14	And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of Man be lifted up , [ e ]
NCB	John	3	15	in order that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life .
NCB	John	3	16	“ For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may attain eternal life .
NCB	John	3	17	“ For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him .
NCB	John	3	18	Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe in him already stands condemned , because he has not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God .
NCB	John	3	19	“ And the judgment is this : the light has come into the world , but people preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil .
NCB	John	3	20	Everyone who does evil hates the light and avoids coming near the light so that his misdeeds may not be exposed .
NCB	John	3	21	However , whoever lives by the truth comes to the light so that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God. ”
NCB	John	3	22	Final Witness of John the Baptist . [ f ] After this , Jesus went with his disciples into the Judean countryside , where he spent some time with them and baptized .
NCB	John	3	23	John was also baptizing at Aenon [ g ] near Salem , because there was an abundance of water there , and people were coming to be baptized .
NCB	John	3	24	At that time , John had not yet been imprisoned .
NCB	John	3	25	Now a dispute about ceremonial washings arose between a certain Jew and the disciples of John .
NCB	John	3	26	Therefore , they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , the one who was with you beyond the Jordan , to whom you bore witness , is baptizing , and everyone is flocking to him. ”
NCB	John	3	27	John replied , “ No one can receive anything except what has been given to him from heaven .
NCB	John	3	28	You yourselves can testify that I said , ‘ I am not the Christ . I have been sent before him. ’
NCB	John	3	29	“ It is the bridegroom who has the bride , but the friend of the bridegroom who stands by and listens for him rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom ’ s voice . This joy of mine is complete .
NCB	John	3	30	He must increase ; I must decrease . He Who Comes from Above [ h ]
NCB	John	3	31	“ The one who comes from above is above all . The one who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of earthly things . The one who comes from heaven is above all .
NCB	John	3	32	He bears witness to the things he has seen and heard , yet no one accepts his testimony .
NCB	John	3	33	“ Whoever accepts his testimony attests that God speaks the truth .
NCB	John	3	34	) . In rich and symbolic words , he is to show how much the believer ’ s life is a gift of God and a newness of existence beyond anything that is in the earthly power of people . - John 3:34 For God gives him the Spirit without measure : another translation is : “ And he gives the Spirit without measure . ”
NCB	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son , and he has entrusted everything into his hand .
NCB	John	3	36	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life ; whoever does not believe in the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God rests upon him. ” Footnotes - John 3:1 Nicodemus : a member of the Sanhedrin or ruling council in virtue of his being a teacher of the Law . - John 3:3 Kingdom of God : this is the basic theme of the preaching of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels . In John , it appears explicitly only in this verse . However , in the Synoptics it almost disappears in the Passion Narrative , whereas in John it is given particular emphasis there . John identifies the kingdom of God with the very person of Jesus . During the public ministry , the splendor of Jesus ’ kingship was somewhat veiled by his fragile humanity , but in the Passion it comes shining through in his exaltation on the cross , which , for John , is intrinsically connected with Jesus ’ glorification in heaven . From above : the Greek word anothen could be translated “ from above ” or “ again. ” Jesus means “ from above , ” but Nicodemus understands “ again. ” - John 3:5 Born of water and the Spirit : this phrase refers to Christian Baptism , the necessary vehicle for our spiritual rebirth , wrought by the Holy Spirit . It may be that here the evangelist is clarifying the words of the Lord according to a later and more mature understanding of Christian teaching , as lived in the primitive community . - John 3:13 The evangelist prolongs the conversation with Nicodemus in meditation on Jesus . What , then , is the mystery of Jesus and what does he bring to the human condition ? The evangelist meditates on the Son of God , the divine messenger now glorified at his Father ’ s side . From Jesus , life came through the cross—as is suggested by the allusion to the bronze serpent intended to cure dying Hebrews ( see Num 21:9 ) . The cross was a testimony of God ’ s love for the world and for each one of us . The cross was also the light given to us . This light enables us to recognize our conduct in truth and compels us to make a decisive choice : either to submit to Jesus and be saved , or to flee and be condemned . - John 3:14 So must the Son of Man be lifted up : the reference is to the lifting up on the cross , which in John ’ s view is identical with the glorification of Jesus . - John 3:22 Using an image familiar to the Jews ( see Deut 31:16 ; Jer 2:2 ; Hos 2:18f ; Mt 9:15 ) , John attests that Jesus is the true Bridegroom , that is , the one in whose person God enters into the new and definitive covenant with his own . The witness , moreover , sets himself aside : he is only the friend of the Bridegroom , whose role is to ask for the hand of the bride and , when the wedding feast is prepared , to introduce her to the Bridegroom . - John 3:23 Aenon : the place has not been identified with certainty . - John 3:31 The evangelist continues his reflection on the mystery of Christ . Jesus is the Son who receives from his Father the fullness of life . He has the mission to reveal it and communicate it to those who believe in him , by giving them the Spirit with whom he himself is filled ( v.

See Gen 33:18-20 ; 48:21f . - John 4:6 Noon : literally , “ the sixth hour. ” See note on Mk 15:25 . - John 4:9 Samaritan woman : characterized as ritually unclean by the Jews , who were therefore forbidden to drink from any vessel handled by them . - John 4:11 Well is deep : the depth of the well , which still exists , has not been determined . The estimates given over the centuries range from

NCB	John	4	5	) . - John 4:31 Jesus is not thinking of an ordinary harvest . The arrival of the Samaritans announces the crops of the end time , the harvest in which all will be gathered together by the coming of God . Samaritans wore white robes : they are the harvest . - John 4:39 The personal and prolonged encounter with Jesus allows believers to measure the magnitude of their mission . This Jewish teacher is not only a prophet who announces salvation . He is the Messiah who brings about salvation for the whole world , for all human beings . - John 4:43 Jesus ’ stay in Galilee and his ministry in his own town will not be crowned by a more satisfactory success than the one in Judea , the heart of Judaism . With this sad reflection , the fourth evangelist confirms a saying of the Lord found in Mt 13:57 and parallels . - John 4:46 Jesus shows the price of faith ( believing in the Word ) to his unbelieving companions ( v.
NCB	John	4	6	,
NCB	John	4	7	When a Samaritan woman came to draw water , Jesus said to her , “ Give me some water to drink. ”
NCB	John	4	8	) . In several of these passages , Jesus joins the phrase with seven significant metaphors that express his saving relationship toward the world : “ I am the bread of life ” ( Jn 6:35 ,
NCB	John	4	9	) . “ I am the good shepherd ” ( Jn 10:11 ,
NCB	John	4	10	Jesus replied , “ If you recognized the gift of God and who it is that is asking you for something to drink , you would have asked him and he would have given you living water. ”
NCB	John	4	11	,
NCB	John	4	12	Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and his cattle ? ”
NCB	John	4	13	Jesus said to her , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again .
NCB	John	4	14	) . “ I am the resurrection and the life ” ( Jn 11:25 ) . “ I am the way and the truth and the life ” ( Jn 14:6 ) . “ I am the true vine ” ( Jn 15:1 ,
NCB	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water so that I may not be thirsty and have to come here to draw water. ”
NCB	John	4	16	Jesus told her , “ Go , call your husband and come back here. ”
NCB	John	4	17	The woman answered him , “ I have no husband. ” Jesus said to her , “ You are right in saying , ‘ I have no husband ’ ;
NCB	John	4	18	,
NCB	John	4	19	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet .
NCB	John	4	20	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain , [ h ] but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem. ”
NCB	John	4	21	Jesus told her , “ Believe me , woman , the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
NCB	John	4	22	You worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know , for salvation is from the Jews .

NCB	John	4	24	,
NCB	John	4	25	The woman said to him , “ I know that the Messiah is coming , the one who is called Christ . When he comes , he will reveal everything to us. ” [ j ]
NCB	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , “ I am he , [ k ] the one who is speaking to you. ”
NCB	John	4	27	At this point , his disciples returned , and they were astonished to find him speaking with a woman , but no one asked , “ What do you want from her ? ” or “ Why are you conversing with her ? ”
NCB	John	4	28	,
NCB	John	4	29	“ Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done . Could this be the Christ ? ”
NCB	John	4	30	And so they departed from the town and made their way to see him .
NCB	John	4	31	The Time of the Harvest . [ l ] Meanwhile , the disciples urged him , “ Rabbi , eat something. ”
NCB	John	4	32	But he told them , “ I have food to eat about which you do not know. ”
NCB	John	4	33	Then his disciples said to one another , “ Could someone have brought him something to eat ? ”
NCB	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , “ My food is to do the will of the one who sent me , and to accomplish his work .
NCB	John	4	35	,
NCB	John	4	36	The reaper is even now receiving his pay ; already he is gathering the crops for eternal life so that the sower and the reaper can rejoice together .
NCB	John	4	37	“ Thus , the saying holds true , ‘ One sows and another reaps. ’
NCB	John	4	38	I sent you to reap what you had not worked for . Others have performed the work , and you have reaped the benefits of their labor. ”
NCB	John	4	39	Jesus Is Truly the Savior of the World . [ m ] Many Samaritans from that town came to believe in him because of the woman ’ s testimony , “ He told me everything I have ever done. ”
NCB	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans came to him , they pleaded with him to stay with them , and he remained there for two days .
NCB	John	4	41	,
NCB	John	4	42	They said to the woman , “ We no longer believe simply because of what you said , for we have heard him for ourselves , and we are convinced that this man is truly the Savior of the world. ”
NCB	John	4	43	Return to Galilee . [ n ] When the two days were over , Jesus departed for Galilee .
NCB	John	4	44	) even though they had already seen him at work . Faith , and it alone , is necessary to be saved . To believe is to welcome in Jesus the salvation that God gives . The miracle is first of all a response to faith . Then it sheds light on the man ’ s faith and makes it strong . The cure is reported less to bring a demonstration of faith than to call upon us to believe . This account may be a third version of the cure of the centurion ’ s son ( Mt 8:5-13 ) or servant ( Lk 7:1-10 ) . - John 4:52 One o ’ clock in the afternoon : literally , “ the seventh hour. ” See note on Mk 15:25 .
NCB	John	4	45	When he arrived in Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , since they had seen all he had done in Jerusalem during the feast , having been at the feast themselves .
NCB	John	4	46	Jesus Heals the Official ’ s Son . [ o ] He went again to Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine . At Capernaum , there was a royal official whose son was ill.
NCB	John	4	47	When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee , he went to him and pleaded that he come and heal his son who was near death .
NCB	John	4	48	,
NCB	John	4	49	The royal official said to him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies. ”
NCB	John	4	50	Jesus replied , “ Return home . Your son will live. ” The man believed what Jesus said to him , and he departed .
NCB	John	4	51	) . “ I am the light of the world ” ( Jn 8:12 ) . “ I am the gate of the sheepfold ” ( Jn 10:7 ,
NCB	John	4	52	He asked them at what time the boy had begun to recover , and they told him , “ The fever left him yesterday at one o ’ clock in the afternoon. ” [ p ]
NCB	John	4	53	Then the father realized that was the exact hour at which Jesus had assured him , “ Your son will live , ” and he and his entire household came to believe .
NCB	John	4	54	This was the second sign that Jesus performed after returning from Judea into Galilee . Footnotes - John 4:1 Jesus is forced to leave Judea in order to distance himself from the hostility of the Pharisees who are jealous of his growing popularity . The journey through Samaria affords him an opportunity to proclaim the Gospel in a mission land , so to speak , for the Samaritans were tantamount to Gentiles in the eyes of the Jews . - John 4:4 Jesus converses with a woman , a daughter of Samaria , and therefore belonging to what the Jews considered to be a heretical breed and as accursed as the Gentiles ; in addition , she is well known as a sinner . But God ’ s gift is for everyone . Jesus is the living water , and for peoples dwelling on the edge of the wilderness , living water symbolizes life , hope , renewal , and spiritual riches . Jesus urges the new worship of God as Father “ in Spirit and truth. ” This means to pray to the Father in the Holy Spirit and in Jesus who is the truth . Such worship springs up from the heart ; it comes from the Spirit . - John 4:4 The inhabitants of Samaria were a mixed race , descended from the intermarriage of Israelites and Assyrian colonists . Although they worshiped the same God as the Jews and believed in the Pentateuch , they disowned the Jerusalem temple and priesthood and erected a rival sanctuary on Mount Gerizim in the 4th century B.C .

NCB	John	4	58	; 10:7 ,
NCB	John	5	5	A man who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years .
NCB	John	5	1	Some time later , Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish feasts .
NCB	John	5	2	Now in Jerusalem , by the Sheep Gate , there is a pool that in Hebrew is called Bethesda . [ c ] It has five porticos ,
NCB	John	5	3	and in these a large number of invalids used to lie , people who were blind , lame , and paralyzed , waiting for the movement of the water . [ d ] [
NCB	John	5	4	For occasionally an angel of the Lord would come down into the pool and stir up the water . The first one into the pool after each such disturbance would be cured of whatever disease he had . ] [ e ]
NCB	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there and was aware that he had been ill for a long time , he said to him , “ Do you want to get well ? ”
NCB	John	5	7	The invalid answered him , “ Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up . While I am still on my way , someone else steps into the pool ahead of me. ”
NCB	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , “ Rise ! Take up your mat and walk ! ”
NCB	John	5	9	Immediately , the man was cured , and he took up his mat and began to walk . Now that day was a Sabbath .
NCB	John	5	10	Therefore , the Jews said to the man who had been cured , “ Today is the Sabbath . It is not lawful for you to carry your mat. ”
NCB	John	5	11	He replied , “ The man who cured me said to me , ‘ Take up your mat and walk ! ’ ”
NCB	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who told you to take it up and walk ? ”
NCB	John	5	13	But the man who had been cured did not know who it was , for Jesus had disappeared into the crowd that was there .
NCB	John	5	14	Later , Jesus found him in the temple and said to him , “ See , you have been made well . Do not sin anymore , so that nothing worse happens to you. ”
NCB	John	5	15	The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the man who had made him well .
NCB	John	5	16	Therefore , the Jews began to harass Jesus because he was doing such things on the Sabbath .
NCB	John	5	17	However , Jesus responded to them , saying , “ My Father is still working , and I am at work as well. ”
NCB	John	5	18	For this reason , the Jews became even more determined to kill him , because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but also calling God his own Father , making himself equal to God .
NCB	John	5	19	The Work of the Son . [ f ] Jesus replied to them , saying , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , the Son can do nothing by himself ; he can do only what he sees the Father doing . For whatever the Father does , the Son also does .
NCB	John	5	20	For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he himself is doing . And he will show him even greater works than these , so that you might be astonished .
NCB	John	5	21	“ Indeed , just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , so does the Son give life to anyone he chooses .
NCB	John	5	22	The Father judges no one , for he has entrusted all judgment to the Son ,
NCB	John	5	23	so that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father . Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
NCB	John	5	24	“ Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever hears my words and believes in the one who sent me possesses eternal life . He will not come to judgment but has passed from death to life .
NCB	John	5	25	“ Amen , amen , I say to you , the hour is coming , indeed it is already here , when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and all those who hear it will live .
NCB	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in himself , so also he has granted the Son to have life in himself .
NCB	John	5	27	And he has also granted him the power to pass judgment , because he is the Son of Man .
NCB	John	5	28	“ Do not be astonished at this , for the hour is coming when all those who are in their graves will hear his voice
NCB	John	5	29	and will come forth from their graves . Those who have done good deeds will rise to life , while those who have done evil will rise to judgment .
NCB	John	5	30	“ I can do nothing on my own . As I hear , I judge , and my judgment is just , because I seek to do not my own will but the will of him who sent me . A Witness to Jesus
NCB	John	5	31	[ g ] “ If I were to testify about myself , my testimony would not be true .
NCB	John	5	32	However , there is another who testifies about me , and I know that his testimony is true , the testimony he bore concerning me .
NCB	John	5	33	You sent messengers to John , and he has testified to the truth .
NCB	John	5	34	Not that I accept such human testimony , but I say these things so that you may be saved .
NCB	John	5	35	“ John was a burning and shining lamp , and for a time you were willing to exult in his light .
NCB	John	5	36	But I have testimony that is greater than John ’ s . The works that my Father has given me to accomplish , the very works that I am doing , testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
NCB	John	5	37	“ And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me . You have not heard his voice or seen his form ,
NCB	John	5	38	and you do not have his word abiding in you , because you do not believe him whom he has sent .
NCB	John	5	39	“ Search the Scriptures carefully because you believe that through them you will gain eternal life . Even they testify on my behalf .
NCB	John	5	40	Yet you refuse to come to me to receive that life . Unbelief of Jesus ’ Hearers
NCB	John	5	41	“ I do not accept the praise of men .
NCB	John	5	42	Moreover , I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts .
NCB	John	5	43	I have come in the name of my Father , yet you do not accept me . But if another should come in his own name , you will accept him .
NCB	John	5	44	How can you believe when you accept praise from one another , yet you do not seek the praise that comes from the only God ?
NCB	John	5	45	“ Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father . You have placed your hope in Moses , and he is the one who will accuse you .
NCB	John	5	46	If you truly believed Moses , you would have believed in me , for it is about me that he wrote .
NCB	John	5	47	But since you do not believe what he wrote , how will you believe what I say ? ” Footnotes - John 5:1 Every Jewish feast is a memorial of what God has done for his people in deeds that manifest his power to create and restore . It is in this setting that the evangelist places an important action of Jesus , which leads to a debate over the meaning of the action : Is God himself at work here ? - John 5:1 Jesus , the Son of God , claims a power that belongs to God alone . In addition , by breaking the Sabbath precept , Jesus proclaims the end of the old covenant . The incident is perhaps to be connected with the feast of Pentecost , which , according to Jewish tradition , commemorates the promulgation of the Law on Sinai . This would make Jesus ’ action even more eloquent . - John 5:2 Bethesda , also called Bethsaida or Bethzatha . - John 5:3 Waiting for the movement of the water : these words appear only in the Caesarean and Western recensions . - John 5:4 This verse is lacking in many important manuscripts , including the oldest . - John 5:19 The action of Jesus creates scandal and anger among the religious authorities . He has to explain his activity and especially his claim that he and the Father are one . The evangelist deepens this affirmation of Jesus ’ divinity . What would be seen as blasphemous in anyone else is here a profound reality . Jesus is one with his Father . All the work of Jesus is God ’ s action among us . Jesus has the power to give or restore life to those who welcome his word as that of God , even if they are victims of sin . To encounter Jesus is to face judgment and to experience eternal life even now . To accept or refuse his work : no decision is more important for us . - John 5:31 The claim made by Jesus has to be confirmed . People can not testify on their own behalf . There was , of course , John the Baptist ’ s testimony in favor of Christ , but it had already become no more than a remembrance . It is in the works of Jesus that believers recognize the attestation of the Father . But how could other people accept this recognition , those who are only preoccupied with their rank in the world , with their person , or with their religious role ? Victimized by such an attitude , they falsify even the testimony of Scripture to protect themselves . Only those people can come to Jesus who rid themselves of their pretensions , human and even religious , those who are truly inflamed with love for God .
NCB	John	6	6	He said this to test him , because Jesus himself knew what he was going to do .
NCB	John	6	1	After this , Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee , also called the Sea of Tiberias ,
NCB	John	6	2	Mac 2:5-8 ) and would reappear at Passover in Messianic times . - John 6:34 Jesus makes an astonishing affirmation : there is a Bread of God for us , and it is a person . Jesus himself fulfills his Father ’ s plan for us ; in Jesus , God is present so that we may have true life . To receive God ’ s Bread is to believe in Jesus and accept him as the Son of God to receive through him the life his Father intends for us . What an astonishing gift ! Jesus does not allow himself to be worshiped as a god or a hero ; he says of himself that he came to satisfy the hunger of people and to fulfill our life . Every other food is only a diversion for our essential hunger . Jesus is the Bread that satisfies this hunger . - John 6:35 I am . . . : this is the first of seven self-descriptions of Jesus introduced by “ I am ” ( see Jn 8:12 ; and 9:5 ; 10:7 ,
NCB	John	6	3	Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down there with his disciples .
NCB	John	6	4	The Jewish feast of Passover was approaching .
NCB	John	6	5	) . These echo Ex 3:14 ( see notes on Jn 4:26 and 6:20 ) . - John 6:41 During the period in the wilderness , the Hebrews doubted the Lord and “ grumbled ” against him ; the memory of this had remained as a warning for all time ( see Ex
NCB	John	6	7	Philip answered him , “ Two hundred days ’ wages [ c ] would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece. ”
NCB	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , said to him ,
NCB	John	6	9	; 10:11 ,
NCB	John	6	10	,
NCB	John	6	11	; Ps 106:25 ) . When the fourth Gospel speaks of “ the Jews , ” the reference is to this mentality , this attitude of rejection , rather than to people as a whole or even to their leaders . - John 6:48 In what sense does Jesus do the Father ’ s will ? By giving his life . He does not use the word “ sacrifice , ” but the terms “ flesh ” and “ blood ” express that idea in a very realistic way . In this gift , the life of the Father is given to human beings and becomes their everlasting life . That is a strong statement , and yet the objection of the Jews , who take it in the most material sense , does not lead to any toning down of it . On the contrary ! - John 6:59 After the success of the multiplication of loaves , scandal arises . The “ flesh ” ( v.
NCB	John	6	12	When they all had eaten enough , he said to the disciples , “ Gather up the fragments that are left over , so that nothing will be wasted. ”
NCB	John	6	13	) . Hence , the evangelist is alluding to Jesus as the Son of God . See note on Jn 4:26 . - John 6:22 Jesus ’ gestures and actions are always signs of God ; in them is expressed something of the mystery of Christ . Thus , the fourth evangelist places on the lips of Jesus a discourse that unveils the mystery . Here , then , is the deep meaning of the miracle of the loaves : Jesus is the Messenger of God , the true Bread handed over to gain life with God for the whole world .
NCB	John	6	14	; 11:25 ; 14:6 ; 15:1 ,
NCB	John	6	15	, 32-34 ; Ps 78:24 . There was a belief that the manna had been hidden by Jeremiah ( see
NCB	John	6	16	; Num
NCB	John	6	17	got into a boat , and set out across the sea to Capernaum . It was already dark , and Jesus had not yet joined them .
NCB	John	6	18	The sea then became rough because a strong wind had started to blow .
NCB	John	6	19	When they had rowed about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat , and they were terrified .
NCB	John	6	20	But he said to them , “ It is I . [ e ] Do not be afraid ! ”
NCB	John	6	21	They were ready to take him into the boat , but the boat immediately reached the shore toward which they were heading . Jesus , the Bread of Life for Believers [ f ] Earthly Food and Heavenly Bread . [ g ] The next day , the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea realized that there had only been one boat there , and that Jesus had not gone along with his disciples ; rather , the disciples had left by themselves .
NCB	John	6	23	Then some boats from Tiberias came near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks .
NCB	John	6	24	When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
NCB	John	6	25	When the people found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , “ Rabbi , when did you come here ? ”
NCB	John	6	26	Jesus answered them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , you came looking for me not because you have seen signs but because you ate the loaves and your hunger was satisfied .
NCB	John	6	27	Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life , which the Son of Man will give you . For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal. ”
NCB	John	6	28	Then they asked him , “ What must we do if we are to carry out the works of God ? ”
NCB	John	6	29	Jesus replied , “ This is the work of God : to believe in the one whom he has sent. ”
NCB	John	6	30	They asked him further , “ What sign can you give us that we can see and come to believe in you ? What work will you do ?
NCB	John	6	31	Our ancestors ate manna in the desert . As it is written , ‘ He gave them bread from heaven [ h ] to eat. ’ ”
NCB	John	6	32	Jesus replied , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven . It is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven .
NCB	John	6	33	For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
NCB	John	6	34	The Bread of Life . [ i ] “ Sir , ” they begged him , “ give us this bread always. ”
NCB	John	6	35	Jesus answered them , “ I am [ j ] the bread of life . Whoever comes to me will never be hungry , and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty .
NCB	John	6	36	But I said to you that you have seen me and yet you do not believe .
NCB	John	6	37	All that the Father gives me will come to me , and anyone who comes to me I will never turn away .
NCB	John	6	38	For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me .
NCB	John	6	39	“ And this is the will of him who sent me : that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me , but that I should raise it up on the last day .
NCB	John	6	40	This indeed is the will of my Father : that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life , and I shall raise them up on the last day. ”
NCB	John	6	41	Faith , a Gift of God . [ k ] Then the Jews murmured about him because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven. ”
NCB	John	6	42	They said , “ Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph ? We know his father and mother . How can he say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ”
NCB	John	6	43	“ Stop murmuring among yourselves ! ” Jesus said .
NCB	John	6	44	“ No one can come to me unless he is drawn by the Father who sent me , and I will raise up that person on the last day .
NCB	John	6	45	It is written in the Prophets , ‘ They will all be taught by God. ’ Everyone who has listened to my Father and learned from him comes to me .
NCB	John	6	46	Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God ; he has seen the Father .
NCB	John	6	47	“ Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believes has eternal life . My Flesh for the Life of the World [ l ]
NCB	John	6	48	“ I am the bread of life .
NCB	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness , and yet they died .
NCB	John	6	50	This is the bread that comes down from heaven , so that one may eat it and not die .
NCB	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven . Whoever eats this bread will live forever ; and the bread that I will give is my flesh , for the life of the world. ”
NCB	John	6	52	Then the Jews started to argue among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? ”
NCB	John	6	53	Jesus said to them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you do not have life within you .
NCB	John	6	54	Whoever feeds upon my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him up on the last day .
NCB	John	6	55	For my flesh is real food , and my blood is real drink .
NCB	John	6	56	“ Whoever feeds upon my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I dwell in him .
NCB	John	6	57	Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father , so whoever feeds upon me will live because of me .
NCB	John	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Unlike your ancestors who ate and nevertheless died , the one who feeds upon this bread will live forever. ”
NCB	John	6	59	The Holy One of God . [ m ] Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum .
NCB	John	6	60	After hearing his words , many of his disciples said , “ This is a hard saying . Who can accept it ? ”
NCB	John	6	61	Aware of the complaints of his disciples , Jesus said to them , “ Does this shock you ?
NCB	John	6	62	What then if you were to behold the Son of Man ascend to where he was before ?
NCB	John	6	63	) —that is , people with their petty desires and thoughts—could not but be shocked by a revelation as absolute as the one they have just heard ( that Jesus is the living Bread come down from heaven ) . Many of his disciples as well as some other people stopped following him , and Judas was already thinking of handing him over . Only the Spirit gives people the will to believe that the Father speaks in Jesus . It is the Spirit who inspires Peter ’ s profession of faith ( see Mt 16:16 ; Mk 8:29 ; Lk 9:20 ) . But the Spirit would not be given in fullness until after Jesus ’ Resurrection ( see Jn 7:39 ) . In regard to Jesus , there is a division among the people . This division and Peter ’ s profession of faith mark a parting of the ways in the life of Jesus . The time of revelation to the disciples has begun and from now on the conflict with the official religion will develop irreconcilably . - John 6:63 Flesh : the human being with its desires and thoughts .
NCB	John	6	64	But there are some among you who do not believe. ” For from the very beginning Jesus knew who did not believe , and who would betray him .
NCB	John	6	65	He said , “ This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by my Father. ”
NCB	John	6	66	After this , many of his disciples turned away and no longer remained with him .
NCB	John	6	67	Then Jesus said to the Twelve , “ Do you also wish to leave ? ”
NCB	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Lord , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
NCB	John	6	69	We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God. ”
NCB	John	6	70	Jesus replied , “ Did I not choose you twelve ? Yet one of you is a devil. ”
NCB	John	6	71	He was speaking of Judas , the son of Simon Iscariot . Although he was one of the Twelve , he would be the one who would betray him . Footnotes - John 6:1 The Jewish Passover is near at hand , and with it the days on which unleavened bread is eaten as a sign of renewal ; the action also recalls the manna that fed the Hebrews in the wilderness . It is in this context that the evangelist places Jesus ’ act of feeding the hungry crowd . The whole action is a sign and foreshadowing of a new Passover and a true life-giving food . Jesus himself , in his person , is the bread of life that God offers to humanity . In order to receive this bread that makes a person live forever , one must believe in the Word . - John 6:1 This is one of the rare passages in which all four Gospels are clearly parallel . At this point , John introduces the discourse on the bread of life . The sign of the loaves is seen as a symbol of the food given to mankind in the Word of God and especially in the Eucharist . - John 6:7 Two hundred days ’ wages : literally : two hundred denarii . A denarius was the average wage for a day ’ s work ( see Mt 20:2 ) . - John 6:16 This account is connected with the preceding passage in the oldest tradition . Like the miracle of the loaves , it shows the absolute mastery Jesus exercises over creatures . For the disciples it is an invitation to believe without reserve : with Jesus present , they will lack nothing , and nothing can put them in peril . - John 6:20 It is I : literally , “ I AM , ” the formula that reveals the name of the Lord in the Old Testament ( see Ex 3:14 ; Isa 41:4 ,
NCB	John	6	22	Thus , it is announced that the words of Jesus are food for people , and that the life of Jesus is given on the cross for the salvation of all . But the Christian addressees of the fourth Gospel could not read this discourse without interpreting it as already announcing the rite inaugurated at the Last Supper ( Mt 26:26 ) , the Eucharist , memorial of the body handed over , of the blood shed , of the sacrifice of the cross . Therefore , this discourse can be read on two levels . The author of the Gospel certainly wanted it so read : the word of God instructs one in the ways of God and the word of God is the bread of life that nourishes the spiritual hunger of God ’ s people . - John 6:22 There is a hunger for everlasting life , a hunger for God ! And there is a bread of God , a food that gives everlasting life to those who believe in Jesus . The miracle of the manna was a symbol of this food ( Ex 16:4 , 13-15 ) . - John 6:31 Bread from heaven : see Ex 16:4 ,
NCB	John	7	7	The world can not hate you , but it does hate me because I testify against it that its works are evil .
NCB	John	7	1	After this , Jesus resumed his travels throughout Galilee . He did not want to go about in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill him .
NCB	John	7	2	However , when the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was drawing near ,
NCB	John	7	3	his brethren [ c ] said to him , “ Depart from here and go into Judea so that your disciples can perceive the works you are doing .
NCB	John	7	4	No one who wishes to be publicly known acts in secret . Since you are doing these things , reveal yourself to the world. ”
NCB	John	7	5	For not even his brethren believed in him .
NCB	John	7	6	Jesus answered them , “ My time has not yet come , but your time is always right .
NCB	John	7	8	Jesus , Savior of Sinners A Woman Caught in Adultery . [ k ] [ 7:53Then each of them returned home . Footnotes - John 7:1 The feast of Tabernacles , one of the most important Jewish solemnities , was a harvest festival . There was also a commemoration of the miraculous deeds that God had done for his people in the wilderness , with a joyous feast of lamps , a festival of lights . The feast was the ideal setting in which to present Christ as the Word of God who had come to enlighten and save everyone . - John 7:1 From now on the threat of death hangs over Jesus and creates tension for him . The tension has to be relieved as quickly as possible . A gathering of people in Jerusalem would be a good occasion for rallying them and neutralizing the adversaries . An impressive public manifestation by Jesus would also be helpful ; people would at least know what to make of him . So reason the “ brethren ” of Jesus—that is , the relatives if not the disciples . But these perspectives of glory have no hold on Jesus . He has come to fulfill God ’ s plan ; this is not the same as looking for a temporary success . He also has come to turn back the course of evil , falsehood , and hatred in the world . Jesus overcame the hatred of the world by handing himself over to it . - John 7:3 Brethren : i.e. , according to Hebrew idiom , close relatives . See note on Mt 12:46 . - John 7:14 Personal success is never the motive for an action of Jesus . His words and his miracles testify that he is the messenger of the Father . Jesus lives by this testimony , of which he is convinced , and does not defend any doctrine of a school or group ; one care alone impels him : that the Father ’ s plan for us be recognized and fulfilled . Only those will understand Jesus who take the Law seriously in its deep inspiration and know the price of fidelity to God . But those who accuse Jesus of violating the Law and take upon themselves the authority to condemn him fail to recognize him . - John 7:15 The people want to know how Jesus can teach like a rabbi , when he was never trained by one and never quotes his teacher . - John 7:21 A single work : the work of which Jesus speaks may be the cure of the paralytic that is recounted in Jn 5:1-15 . - John 7:25 The new prophet intrigues the people . He is one of theirs , yet claims an origin that does not cease to be mysterious . Some of the people are tempted to recognize him as the Messiah . The official authorities rebel against this temptation and want him arrested . In veiled words , Jesus announces his return to the Father ( vv . 33-34 ) . The authorities see this as an attempt to flee Palestine . In all these contrasts there is perhaps some irony . Jesus escapes the people who want to place him in their preconceived ideas , just as he escapes the people who want to lay hands on him . Jesus can be talked about endlessly ; it is quite another thing to accept his mystery . - John 7:37 The last day was for the pilgrims a festival of water . How many symbolic meanings water evokes ! Water had flowed miraculously from the rock in the midst of the wilderness to slake the thirst of the Hebrews ( Ex 17:1-7 ) . The Prophets had foretold a spring that would some day open in the midst of the people ( Ezek 47:1 ; Zec 14:8 ) . In all areas affected by drought , water is a sign of life and joy ; it is a gift of God . Christians think of Pentecost and Baptism . - John 7:37 An alternative reading and translation is : “ If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me , and let him who believes in me drink . As Scripture has said . . . . ” In this second reading , the Scripture passage refers to Jesus and not to the believer . See Ps 105:41 ; Isa 44:3 ; 48:21 ; Ezek 36:25 ; Joel 3:1 ; etc . - John 7:40 The upper class felt only contempt for the ordinary people . How could one accept a Messiah who came from distant Galilee , where Jews mingled with Gentiles and were cut off from the heart of Jewish life ? Some justified their rejection by citing passages of the Law , but there were others who appealed to the spirit of the Law . - John 7:53 This story is missing in a number of ancient manuscripts and is inserted at other points in others ; it does not seem to be from the author of the fourth Gospel , for it is written in quite a different style . However , it has been accepted by the Church as the work of an inspired author . We are struck by the portrait of Jesus found herein : his silence , his sober gesture , his refusal to use religion as a pretext to spy on and judge others , and his courage to proclaim his own truth . It is pointless to ask what he wrote on the ground . Let us dwell on what he considered the Law to be : it condemns sin not so that people may judge one another but so that they may feel the need to be saved by God . And it is to this salvation that he bears witness .
NCB	John	7	9	After he had said this , he stayed behind in Galilee .
NCB	John	7	10	Later , however , after his brethren had gone up to the feast , he himself also went , not publicly , but in secret .
NCB	John	7	11	During the feast the Jews were looking for him and asking , “ Where is he ? ”
NCB	John	7	12	There was widespread murmuring about him among the crowds . Some maintained , “ He is a good man , ” but others insisted , “ No , for he is leading the people astray. ”
NCB	John	7	13	However , no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jews .
NCB	John	7	14	Do Not Judge by Appearances . [ d ] When the feast was half over , Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach .
NCB	John	7	15	The Jews were astonished , and they wondered , “ How has this man acquired such knowledge when he has never studied ? ” [ e ]
NCB	John	7	16	Jesus answered them , “ My teaching is not my own ; rather , it comes from him who sent me .
NCB	John	7	17	Anyone who resolves to do his will will know whether my teaching comes from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority .
NCB	John	7	18	Whoever speaks on his own authority is simply seeking his own glory , but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a truthful person , and there is no dishonesty in him .
NCB	John	7	19	“ Did not Moses give you the Law ? And not one of you keeps the Law . Why are you trying to kill me ? ”
NCB	John	7	20	The crowd shouted , “ You are possessed ! Who is trying to kill you ? ”
NCB	John	7	21	Jesus replied , “ I performed a single work , [ f ] and all of you are astonished .
NCB	John	7	22	Moses gave you circumcision —although it did not originate with Moses but with the patriarchs— and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath .
NCB	John	7	23	Now if a man can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses may not be broken , why are you angry with me for making a man ’ s entire body completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
NCB	John	7	24	Do not base your judgment on appearances ; judge according to what is right. ”
NCB	John	7	25	Where Is Jesus from and Where Is He Going ? [ g ] Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem said , “ Is this not the man they are trying to kill ?
NCB	John	7	26	And yet he is speaking publicly , and they say nothing to him ! Can it be that the authorities realize that he is the Christ ?
NCB	John	7	27	And yet we know where this man is from . But when the Christ appears , no one will know where he is from. ”
NCB	John	7	28	Then Jesus cried out as he was teaching in the temple , “ You know me , and you also know where I am from . Yet I have not come of my own accord , but he who sent me is true . You do not know him ,
NCB	John	7	29	but I know him because I am from him and it was he who sent me. ”
NCB	John	7	30	So they tried to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come .
NCB	John	7	31	Yet many in the crowd believed in him , and they said , “ When the Christ comes , will he perform more signs than this man has accomplished ? ”
NCB	John	7	32	When the Pharisees overheard the crowd murmuring about him , the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him .
NCB	John	7	33	Jesus then said , “ I will remain with you only for a short time longer , and then I shall return to him who sent me .
NCB	John	7	34	You will search for me , but you will not find me , for where I am you can not come. ”
NCB	John	7	35	The Jews said to one another , “ Where does this man intend to go that we will not be able to find him ? Will he go abroad to the people who are dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks ?
NCB	John	7	36	What does he mean when he says , ‘ You will search for me , but you will be unable to find me , ’ and ‘ Where I am you can not come ’ ? ”
NCB	John	7	37	Streams of Living Water . [ h ] [ i ] On the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood up and cried out , “ If anyone is thirsty , let him come to me and drink .
NCB	John	7	38	Whoever believes in me , as Scripture has said , ‘ Streams of living water shall flow from within him. ’ ”
NCB	John	7	39	Now he was referring here to the Spirit whom those who believed in him were to receive . As yet the Spirit had not been bestowed because Jesus had not yet been glorified .
NCB	John	7	40	People Are Divided concerning Jesus . [ j ] On hearing these words , some in the crowd said , “ This must truly be the Prophet. ”
NCB	John	7	41	Others thought , “ This is the Christ. ” But still others retorted , “ How can the Christ come from Galilee ?
NCB	John	7	42	Does not Scripture assert that the Christ will be of the seed of David and come from Bethlehem , the city where David lived ? ”
NCB	John	7	43	As a result , the crowd was sharply divided because of him .
NCB	John	7	44	Some of them even wanted to arrest him , but no one laid a hand on him .
NCB	John	7	45	Then the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees , who asked them , “ Why did you not arrest him ? ”
NCB	John	7	46	The guards answered , “ No one has ever spoken as this man has. ”
NCB	John	7	47	Then the Pharisees said , “ Have you also been deceived ?
NCB	John	7	48	Has any one of the authorities or of the Pharisees come to believe in him ?
NCB	John	7	49	As for this crowd , they do not know the Law—they are cursed. ”
NCB	John	7	50	One of them , Nicodemus , who had previously come to Jesus , said to them ,
NCB	John	7	51	“ Does our Law allow us to pass judgment on someone without first giving him a hearing to ascertain what he is doing ? ”
NCB	John	7	52	They replied , “ Are you too a Galilean ? Look it up , and you will find that no prophet is to arise from Galilee. ” Chapter
NCB	John	8	8	Then he again bent down and wrote on the ground .
NCB	John	8	1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives .
NCB	John	8	2	At daybreak he entered the temple courts , and all the people gathered around him . He sat down and began to teach them .
NCB	John	8	3	The scribes and the Pharisees brought in a woman who had been caught in adultery . Forcing her to stand in their midst ,
NCB	John	8	4	they said to him , “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the very act of adultery . [ b ]
NCB	John	8	5	Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women . [ c ] What do you have to say ? ”
NCB	John	8	6	They asked him this question as a test so that they could bring a charge against him . Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger .
NCB	John	8	7	When they continued to persist in their question , he straightened up and said to them , “ Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her. ” [ d ]
NCB	John	8	9	When they heard his response , they went away one by one , beginning with the elders , until Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him .
NCB	John	8	10	Then Jesus straightened up and said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? ”
NCB	John	8	11	She replied , “ No one , sir. ” “ Neither do I condemn you , ” Jesus said . “ Go on your way , and sin no more. ” ] The Light Triumphs over Darkness
NCB	John	8	12	The Light of the World . [ e ] Jesus addressed them once again , saying , “ I am [ f ] the light of the world . The one who follows me will never walk in darkness . Rather , he will have the light of life. ”
NCB	John	8	13	On hearing this , the Pharisees said to him , “ You are testifying on your own behalf . Your testimony is not true. ”
NCB	John	8	14	Jesus replied , “ Even though I testify on my own behalf , my testimony is true , because I know where I have come from and where I am going , whereas you do not know where I have come from or where I am going .
NCB	John	8	15	You judge by the flesh , whereas I do not judge anyone .
NCB	John	8	16	Yet even if I do judge , my judgment is true because it is not I alone who judge , but it is I and the Father who sent me .
NCB	John	8	17	“ In your Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true .
NCB	John	8	18	I testify on my own behalf , and the Father who sent me also testifies on my behalf. ”
NCB	John	8	19	They continued to question him , saying , “ Where is your Father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You know neither me nor my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father also. ”
NCB	John	8	20	He spoke these words while he was teaching at the treasury of the temple . [ g ] However , no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come .
NCB	John	8	21	I AM ! [ h ] Again he said to them , “ I am going away , and you will search for me but you will die in your sin . Where I am going , you can not come. ”
NCB	John	8	22	Then the Jews wondered , “ Is he planning to kill himself—because he was saying , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come ’ ? ”
NCB	John	8	23	He continued , “ You belong to what is below , whereas I belong to what is above . You belong to this world , but I am not of this world .
NCB	John	8	24	That is why I told you that you would die in your sins . For if you do not believe that I AM , you will die in your sins. ”
NCB	John	8	25	“ Who are you then ? ” they asked him . Jesus answered , “ Just what I have been telling you from the beginning .
NCB	John	8	26	I have much to say about you , and much to condemn . But the one who sent me is true , and what I have heard from him I declare to the world. ”
NCB	John	8	27	They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father .
NCB	John	8	28	Therefore , Jesus said , “ When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I AM , that I do nothing on my own authority and I say nothing except what the Father has taught me .
NCB	John	8	29	He who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , for I always do what pleases him. ”
NCB	John	8	30	On hearing these words , many came to believe in him .
NCB	John	8	31	Jesus and Abraham . [ i ] Then Jesus said to those Jews who did believe in him , “ If you remain faithful to my word , you will truly be my disciples .
NCB	John	8	32	You will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ”
NCB	John	8	33	They answered him , “ We are descendants of Abraham , and we have never been slaves to anyone . What do you mean by saying , ‘ You will be set free ’ ? ”
NCB	John	8	34	Jesus replied , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , everyone who sins is a slave of sin .
NCB	John	8	35	A slave does not remain in a household forever , but a son remains in it forever .
NCB	John	8	36	Therefore , if the Son sets you free , you then will truly be free .
NCB	John	8	37	“ I know that you are descendants of Abraham , but you seek to kill me because my word has no place in your heart .
NCB	John	8	38	I speak of what I have seen in my Father ’ s presence , whereas you do what you have heard from your father. ”
NCB	John	8	39	The Jews said to him , “ Abraham is our father. ” Jesus said to them , “ If you were Abraham ’ s children , you would be doing the works that Abraham did .
NCB	John	8	40	But now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God . This is not what Abraham did .
NCB	John	8	41	You are doing the works of your father ! ” They retorted , “ We are not illegitimate children . We have one father—God. ”
NCB	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your father , you would love me , for I came from God ; neither did I come of my own will , but he was the one who sent me .
NCB	John	8	43	Why do you not understand what I am saying ? It is because you can not bear to hear my words .
NCB	John	8	44	“ You are from your father , the devil , and you choose to carry out your father ’ s desires . He was a murderer from the beginning , and he does not abide by the truth , for there is no truth in him . When he lies , he speaks in accord with his own nature , for he is a liar and the father of lies .
NCB	John	8	45	But because I speak the truth you refuse to believe me .
NCB	John	8	46	“ Which of you can convict me of sin ? If I say what is true , why do you not believe me ?
NCB	John	8	47	Whoever comes from God listens to the words of God . The reason why you refuse to listen is that you do not belong to God. ”
NCB	John	8	48	The Jews answered , “ Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed ? ”
NCB	John	8	49	Jesus said , “ I am not possessed . I honor my Father , but you dishonor me .
NCB	John	8	50	I do not seek my own glory . There is one who seeks it , and he is the judge .
NCB	John	8	51	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever keeps my word will never see death. ”
NCB	John	8	52	The Jews retorted , “ Now we are positive that you are possessed . Abraham died , and the Prophets are dead . Yet you say , ‘ Whoever keeps my word will never taste death. ’
NCB	John	8	53	Are you greater than our father Abraham ? He is dead , and the Prophets are also dead . Who do you claim to be ? ”
NCB	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I glorify myself , that glory is of no value . It is my Father who glorifies me , the one about whom you say , ‘ He is our God , ’
NCB	John	8	55	even though you do not know him . However , I do know him . If I would say that I do not know him , I would be a liar like you . But I do know him , and I keep his word .
NCB	John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day . He saw it and was glad. ” [ j ]
NCB	John	8	57	The Jews then said to him , “ You are not yet fifty years old . How can you have seen Abraham ? ”
NCB	John	8	58	Jesus responded , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , before Abraham was , I AM. ” [ k ]
NCB	John	8	59	Then they picked up stones to throw at him , but he hid himself and left the temple . Footnotes - John 8:1 This story is missing in a number of ancient manuscripts and is inserted at other points in others ; it does not seem to be from the author of the fourth Gospel , for it is written in quite a different style . However , it has been accepted by the Church as the work of an inspired author . We are struck by the portrait of Jesus found herein : his silence , his sober gesture , his refusal to use religion as a pretext to spy on and judge others , and his courage to proclaim his own truth . It is pointless to ask what he wrote on the ground . Let us dwell on what he considered the Law to be : it condemns sin not so that people may judge one another but so that they may feel the need to be saved by God . And it is to this salvation that he bears witness . - John 8:4 Caught in the very act of adultery : Jewish law required witnesses to have seen the act . - John 8:5 Stone such women : stoning was required only if the woman was a betrothed virgin ( Deut 22:23-24 ) . The Law also demanded the execution of both parties ( Lev 20:10 ; Deut 22:22 ) . - John 8:7 The Law stipulated that the first stones were to be cast by the witnesses ( Deut 17:7 ) . - John 8:12 Here is another symbol , which has the feast of Lights for its setting and enables us to understand more fully the part Jesus intends to play in the life of human beings : he is light . We may think of the luminous cloud during the journey in the wilderness ( see Ex 13:21 ; Wis 18:3 ) , the form in which God was leading his people . - John 8:12 I am : see notes on Jn 6:20 and 6:35 . - John 8:20 The treasury of the temple : not the place where the offerings were stored , since this was closed to the public , but the adjacent room where the boxes for the offerings stood ( see Mk 12:41 ; Lk 21:1 ) . - John 8:21 The discussion is continued so that the reader may come into direct contact with the mystery of Jesus . Who then is he ? He does not belong to the world of sin but gathers around himself those who believe in him . Without this faith in him , people remain shut up in death , cast off from God . A sudden word is uttered : I am , the name by which God revealed himself to Moses ( Ex 3:14 ) . Jesus is so closely united to his Father that he can claim the title “ Lord ” for himself . Jesus will appear as Judge and Lord when he is lifted up on the cross ( Jn 3:14 ; 19:37 ) . - John 8:31 The Jews can rightly protest that they are not illegitimate children , that is , using the imagery of the time , they have not grown up in idolatry but in faith in the true God . But that is not enough . To oppose Jesus and reject the truth means entering into an agreement with the devil . Jesus says that he is superior even to Abraham , the father of the people . - John 8:56 Abraham rejoiced at the promise given to him by the Lord that the future Messiah would come from his descendants ( Gen 12:7 ; 15:2f ; 17:15f ; see Gal 3:16 ) . My day : that is , the presence of the Messiah , whom Abraham saw and greeted “ from a distance ” ( Heb 11:13 ) . - John 8:58 I AM : see notes on Jn 6:20 and 6:35 .
NCB	John	9	9	Some were saying , “ Yes , this is the same man , ” but others insisted , “ No . It simply is someone who looks like him. ” He said , “ I am the man. ”
NCB	John	9	1	As Jesus walked along , he saw a man who had been blind from birth .
NCB	John	9	2	His disciples asked him , “ Rabbi , who sinned , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? ”
NCB	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ Neither this man nor his parents sinned , but it happened so that the works of God might be revealed in him .
NCB	John	9	4	We must do the works of him who sent me while it is still day . Night is coming when no one can work .
NCB	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ”
NCB	John	9	6	When he had said this , he spat on the ground , made a paste with the saliva , and smeared the paste on the eyes of the blind man .
NCB	John	9	7	Then he said to him , “ Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam. ” [ c ] ( The name means “ Sent. ” ) The man went forth and washed , and he returned seeing . That Man Is a Prophet . [ d ]
NCB	John	9	8	His neighbors and those who had seen him begging asked , “ Is this not the man who used to sit and beg ? ”
NCB	John	9	10	Therefore , they asked him , “ Then how were your eyes opened ? ”
NCB	John	9	11	He replied , “ The man called Jesus made a paste and smeared it over my eyes . Then he said to me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash. ’ So I went and washed , and then I was able to see. ”
NCB	John	9	12	They asked him , “ Where is he ? ” He replied , “ I do not know. ”
NCB	John	9	13	They then brought the man who had formerly been blind to the Pharisees .
NCB	John	9	14	Now it was on a Sabbath day that Jesus had made the paste and opened his eyes .
NCB	John	9	15	The Pharisees also asked him how he had gained his sight . He said to them , “ He put a paste on my eyes . Then I washed , and now I can see. ”
NCB	John	9	16	Some of the Pharisees said , “ This man can not be from God , for he does not observe the Sabbath. ” But others said , “ How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs ? ” Thus , they were divided in their opinions .
NCB	John	9	17	And so they spoke again to the blind man , asking , “ What do you have to say about him ? It was your eyes that he opened. ” He replied , “ He is a prophet. ”
NCB	John	9	18	However , the Jews refused to believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned the parents of the man who had received his sight
NCB	John	9	19	and asked them , “ Is this your son who you say was born blind ? How then is he now able to see ? ”
NCB	John	9	20	His parents answered , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind ,
NCB	John	9	21	but we do not know how he is now able to see , nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him . He is of age . He can speak for himself. ”
NCB	John	9	22	His parents responded in this way because they were afraid of the Jews . For the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged Jesus to be the Christ would be put out of the synagogue .
NCB	John	9	23	This is why his parents said , “ He is of age . Ask him. ”
NCB	John	9	24	That Man Is from God . [ e ] And so for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and said to him , “ Give glory to God . We know that this man is a sinner. ”
NCB	John	9	25	He answered , “ I do not know whether he is a sinner . But one thing I do know : I was blind , and now I am able to see. ”
NCB	John	9	26	They then asked him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
NCB	John	9	27	He answered them , “ I have told you already and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you also want to become his disciples ? ”
NCB	John	9	28	Then they began to taunt him , saying , “ It is you who are his disciple . We are disciples of Moses .
NCB	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses , but as for this man , we do not know where he is from. ”
NCB	John	9	30	He answered , “ That is what is so amazing . You do not know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
NCB	John	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners , but that he does listen to anyone who is devout and obeys his will .
NCB	John	9	32	“ Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind .
NCB	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he could not have been able to accomplish anything. ”
NCB	John	9	34	They answered him , “ You were born in sin and you would teach us ? ” Then they threw him out .
NCB	John	9	35	Do You Believe in the Son of Man ? [ f ] When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , he found him and asked , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
NCB	John	9	36	He replied , “ Who is he , sir , so that I may believe in him ? ”
NCB	John	9	37	“ You have seen him , ” said Jesus , “ and he is the one who is speaking to you. ”
NCB	John	9	38	He said , “ I do believe , Lord , ” and he fell down in worship before him .
NCB	John	9	39	Spiritual Blindness . [ g ] Then Jesus said , “ It is for judgment that I have come into this world , so that those without sight may see and those who do see may become blind. ”
NCB	John	9	40	On hearing this , some Pharisees who were present asked him , “ Are we blind too ? ”
NCB	John	9	41	Jesus replied , “ If you were blind , you would have no guilt ; but since you claim , ‘ We see , ’ your guilt remains . Footnotes - John 9:1 The preceding chapters have made grand statements about Jesus , e.g. , that he is the light of the world ; in those chapters , however , the evangelist was guiding us through sometimes difficult reasonings . Here , on the other hand , is a lively story that illustrates the teaching that has been given . The man born blind is an image of the catechumen and of Christians , who allow themselves to be enlightened by Jesus . Not only their eyes but their hearts open to the light . - John 9:1 In the view of the ancients , every illness had its origin in some sin , perhaps a secret one . Jesus firmly condemns this mentality . The blind man must take himself to the Pool of “ Siloam ” ( = “ Sent ” ) ; the evangelist emphasizes the word . Jesus is the one sent by the Father to bring light ; it is he who opens the eyes of faith in those who go down into the pool of Baptism . - John 9:7 The Pool of Siloam : it was at the foot of the southern spur of the temple mount . - John 9:8 Who , then , is Jesus ? Again there is questioning . Again also Jesus upsets the Pharisees , who have lost the essence of religion in the complexities of their traditions . The care for observances makes them forget that the Sabbath is first of all a testimony of liberty . In the presence of these teachers , the blind man who has been cured declares that Jesus is a prophet . They challenge his attestation and denounce it as a fraud . Thus , an inquiry is made to give themselves basis for their treatment of the man . A climate of fear ensues , and no one feels free to speak . - John 9:24 The miraculously cured individual is interrogated a second time . His questioners bring up Moses to show that Jesus is in contradiction with him . This , they think , can not be refuted . But it is necessary to recognize here the presence of the same God who spoke to Moses ! The man born blind recognizes that Jesus came from God with a special mission . That is too much for them . They throw him out bodily . - John 9:35 This is an encounter with Jesus , who identifies himself as the Son of Man—that is , as a being with a divine prerogative who has come to bring people to the presence of and communion with God . The profession of faith comes to the lips of the man born blind when he encounters Jesus , who is our light . - John 9:39 Human beings can not remain indifferent or neutral in the presence of Jesus : we must opt either for light or for darkness . In this choice , the divine judgment comes into play with a sentence of life or death—which foretells the division between synagogue and Church . The lot of each person depends on one ’ s attitude of faith or unbelief toward Jesus . Those who realize they are walking along the way of error and open themselves to the light of the Gospel revelation will be saved . Those who delude themselves that they possess the truth and voluntarily close their eyes to the light will be lost . While the man born blind receives not only his physical sight but also the light of faith , the Jews who claim that they have sight are blind in a spiritual sense , because they refuse the light of revelation brought by Christ . True blindness is not the physical blindness of the blind man but the lack of belief . The Pharisees are convinced that they possess the truth and oppose themselves to the Envoy of God . They deprive themselves of the way to salvation . For they remain slaves of the sin of unbelief .
NCB	John	10	10	“ A thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy . I have come that they may have life , and have it in abundance .
NCB	John	10	1	Mac 4:36-39 ;
NCB	John	10	2	Chr 19:6 ) . - John 10:40 The testimony of John the Baptist is recalled : the Prophet announced a Messiah whose dignity and power were superhuman ( see Jn 1:26-34 ) .
NCB	John	10	3	The gatekeeper opens for him , and the sheep hear his voice . He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
NCB	John	10	4	“ When he has brought out all his own , he goes on ahead of them , and the sheep follow him because they know his voice .
NCB	John	10	5	However , they will never follow a stranger . Rather , they will run away from him , because they do not recognize the voice of strangers. ”
NCB	John	10	6	Jesus used this parable to instruct them , but they did not understand what he was saying to them .
NCB	John	10	7	Therefore , Jesus spoke to them again , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , I am the gate of the sheepfold .
NCB	John	10	8	All who came before me were thieves and bandits , but the sheep did not listen to them .
NCB	John	10	9	“ I am the gate . Anyone who enters through me will be saved . He will go in and out and will find pasture .
NCB	John	10	11	“ I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
NCB	John	10	12	The hired hand , who is not the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep , sees the wolf approaching , and he leaves the sheep and runs away , while the wolf catches and scatters them .
NCB	John	10	13	He runs away because he is only a hired hand and he has no concern for the sheep .
NCB	John	10	14	“ I am the good shepherd . I know my own , and my own know me ,
NCB	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father . And I lay down my life for the sheep .
NCB	John	10	16	“ I have other sheep too that do not belong to this fold . I must lead them as well , and they will hear my voice . Thus , there will only be one flock , one shepherd .
NCB	John	10	17	“ This is why the Father loves me , because I lay down my life in order to take it up again .
NCB	John	10	18	No one takes it away from me . I lay it down of my own free will . And as I have the power to lay it down , I have the power to take it up again . This command I have received from my Father. ”
NCB	John	10	19	Once again , these words provoked a division among the Jews .
NCB	John	10	20	Many of them were saying , “ He is possessed and out of his mind . Why should we listen to him ? ”
NCB	John	10	21	But others said , “ No one possessed by a demon could speak like this . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? ” [ c ] I and the Father Are One
NCB	John	10	22	Feast of the Dedication . [ d ] At that time , the feast of the Dedication was taking place in Jerusalem . It was winter ,
NCB	John	10	23	; Ezek
NCB	John	10	24	The Jews gathered around him and asked , “ How much longer will you keep us in suspense ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly. ”
NCB	John	10	25	Jesus replied , “ I have told you , but you do not believe . The works that I do in my Father ’ s name bear witness to me ,
NCB	John	10	26	but you do not believe because you are not my sheep .
NCB	John	10	27	“ My sheep listen to my voice . I know them , and they follow me .
NCB	John	10	28	I give them eternal life , and they will never perish . No one will ever snatch them from my hand .
NCB	John	10	29	My Father who has given them to me is greater than all , and no one can snatch them out of the Father ’ s hand .
NCB	John	10	30	I and the Father are one. ” [ f ]
NCB	John	10	31	Once again , the Jews picked up rocks to stone him ,
NCB	John	10	32	but Jesus said to them , “ I have performed in your presence many good works from my Father . For which of these works are you going to stone me ? ”
NCB	John	10	33	The Jews answered , “ We are not going to stone you for any good work you have done , but for blasphemy . Even though you are a man , you are claiming to be God. ”
NCB	John	10	34	; Zec 11:4-17 ) . In the final analysis ( they said ) , God alone is the shepherd to whom the flock belongs and who can properly lead and feed it . They were longing for a devoted shepherd who would act solely in God ’ s name . Jesus now dares to describe himself as this Messiah-shepherd , who comes to deliver human beings from those who enslave them for their own profit or to impose upon them their own convictions . There are no other ways of reaching life and the knowledge of God : Jesus is the “ gate ” ; he is the Shepherd who knows and gathers believers into a single flock . The word “ know ” signifies a mutual exchange , a reciprocal and radical belonging . This is the main assertion of the passage . - John 10:21 This is a reference to the incident of the man born blind ( in the preceding chapter ) . - John 10:22 In the fourth Gospel , the trial of Jesus takes place throughout the book , and on each occasion the Lord asserts his oneness with the Father in unequivocal terms . Here we have a new disagreement , connected with the feast of the Dedication of the temple , which was celebrated toward the end of December . It commemorated the historical fact that in
NCB	John	10	35	If those to whom the word of God was addressed are called ‘ gods ’ —and Scripture can not be set aside—
NCB	John	10	36	how can you say , ‘ You blaspheme , ’ to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world for saying , ‘ I am the Son of God ’ ?
NCB	John	10	37	“ If I am not performing the works of my Father , then do not believe me .
NCB	John	10	38	However , if I am doing them , then even if you do not believe me , at least believe my works , so that you may realize and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. ”
NCB	John	10	39	They again tried to seize him , but he escaped from their clutches .
NCB	John	10	40	The Testimony of John the Baptist . [ h ] He went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing , and he remained there .
NCB	John	10	41	Many people came to him , and they were saying , “ John performed no sign , but everything that John said about this man was true. ”
NCB	John	10	42	And many there came to believe in him . Footnotes - John 10:1 The parable of the good shepherd , the feast of the Dedication , and the raising of Lazarus are three passages that describe who Christ is and what he wants to be for us . The ideas of life and unity dominate in these pages . The desire of Jesus is that we have access to the full reality of life . He gives life to the point of giving up his own ; he is the life . Another preoccupation impels him : to gather into one all who believe in him . So the work of God is to overcome the forces of death , destruction , and dispersion , forces that disfigure the world and our existence . - John 10:1 The image of the flock and the shepherd occurs frequently in the Bible to describe the relationship of Israel with God , or simply the relations of the people with their leader ( this language came spontaneously to any civilization of antiquity ) . More than once the Prophets denounced as wicked shepherds those in authority who exploited the people or led them astray : kings , princes , priests , prophets of comfort ( see Jer
NCB	John	10	165	B.C . Judas Maccabeus wrested the temple from the pagan king who had profaned it by installing an idol in it . It was thus a celebration of the liberation , purification , and restoration of the holy place and of its worship ( see
NCB	John	11	11	After saying this , he went on to tell them , “ Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep , but I am going there to awaken him. ”
NCB	John	11	1	In Bethany , the village of Mary and her sister Martha , a certain man named Lazarus had fallen ill.
NCB	John	11	2	Chr 30:1-3 , 15-18 ) . Since Jesus had been present in Jerusalem at the feasts of Tabernacles and Dedication , the populace expected him to be there again . A warrant had been issued for his arrest , and anyone who knew his whereabouts had to declare it under penalty of complicity .
NCB	John	11	3	And so the sisters sent this message to him , “ Lord , the one you love is ill. ”
NCB	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this , he said , “ This illness is not to end in death . Rather , it is for God ’ s glory , so that by means of it the Son of Man may be glorified. ”
NCB	John	11	5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
NCB	John	11	6	So after learning that Lazarus was ill , he remained for two more days in the place where he was .
NCB	John	11	7	Then he said to his disciples , “ Let us return to Judea. ”
NCB	John	11	8	His disciples said to him , “ Rabbi , just a short time ago the Jews were trying to stone you . Why do you want to go back there ? ”
NCB	John	11	9	) ; and his light must instill courage into those who follow him ( vv . 10-11 ) . - John 11:16 Twin , i.e. , Didymus , is the Greek translation of the Aramaic Toma , which means “ twin. ” - John 11:17 Faced with the death of a friend and the sufferings of the man ’ s relatives , Jesus responds with true humanity and a compassionate heart ; by restoring life to Lazarus , he shows himself to be the Son of God , to whom the Father has given everything he asks for . The hope of a resurrection on the last day was shared by many believers , such as Martha ; this conviction had been growing for about a century or two in fervent Jewish circles , such as that of the Pharisees (
NCB	John	11	10	But if he walks at night , he stumbles , because he does not have the light. ”
NCB	John	11	12	The disciples responded , “ Lord , if he has fallen asleep , he will recover. ”
NCB	John	11	13	Jesus , however , had been speaking about the death of Lazarus , but they thought that he was speaking of ordinary sleep .
NCB	John	11	14	Finally , Jesus told them in plain words , “ Lazarus is dead .
NCB	John	11	15	; Num 9:6-14 ;
NCB	John	11	16	) ; he is the true Lamb who gives his life and whose blood poured out delivers the people from enslavement to evil and sin and opens the way to the true promised land , to the Father , in a communion of life with him . The last section of the Gospel of John is centered on this mystery of the Passion of Christ . The fate awaiting Jesus from the first pages of this Gospel is fulfilled ; his adversaries have decided to put him to death and are waiting to have the sentence executed . It is the reign of darkness . But the hour of Jesus ’ death and defeat is another reality , that of triumph and glory ; and it will be confirmed by the Resurrection of the Crucified . The time of the Church will be inaugurated . She will receive the Spirit promised by Jesus and—as is indicated by the last signs ( the miraculous catch of fish and the investiture of Peter ) —will be established and sent forth to preach everywhere . She is to proclaim salvation and life so as to gather together all believers until the day when Christ will return in his glory as Son of God and Savior of the world . - John 11:55 The time for signs has ended . The glory that the signs announced is going to appear . How ? It will not be through the deceitful glory of human triumphs ; it will be through the presence of God in the action of Jesus and in the transformation of the human condition . Jesus ’ hour of glory is above all the hour of his death . - John 11:55 According to the tradition followed by the fourth Gospel , the woman who pours the perfume on the feet of Jesus is Mary , the sister of Lazarus . With the prodigality of love she expresses her gratitude for the raising of her brother from the dead ; but Jesus evokes his own death , and Mary ’ s gesture points ahead to this , anticipating by her anointing the rite of burial : it is an act of veneration . Wasteful squandering ? Only Judas , whose shadow already darkens the picture , thinks so . It is not such veneration of Christ that turns his attention to the poor ; it is avarice—at the same time that Jesus is being glorified at Bethany , the plot against him is being laid for civic reasons , as we saw earlier . - John 11:55 This is probably the Passover of the year

Because of civic and religious considerations it is necessary to decide the fate of this man , who unsettles the certainties and confronts the institutions and the established power . Without realizing it , Caiaphas , the high priest who had held this office since A.D.
NCB	John	11	24	Martha replied , “ I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day. ”
NCB	John	11	25	Jesus then said to her , “ I am the resurrection and the life . Whoever believes in me , even though he dies , will live ,
NCB	John	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
NCB	John	11	27	“ Yes , Lord , ” she replied . “ I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , the one who is to come into the world. ”
NCB	John	11	28	When she had said this , she went back and took her sister Mary aside , telling her privately , “ The Teacher is here and is asking for you. ”
NCB	John	11	29	As soon as she heard this , she got up quickly and went to him .
NCB	John	11	30	, which was to be Jesus ’ last . The devout Jews journeyed to Jerusalem to complete the ritual purifications necessary for Passover celebrations ( see Ex 19:10-11 ,
NCB	John	11	31	When the Jews who were in the house consoling her saw Mary get up quickly and go out , they followed her , assuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
NCB	John	11	32	Mary came to the place where Jesus was , and as soon as she saw him , she fell at his feet and said to him , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
NCB	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her weeping , and beheld the Jews who were with her also weeping , he became deeply moved in spirit and angry .
NCB	John	11	34	He asked , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to him , “ Lord , come and see. ”
NCB	John	11	35	Jesus began to weep ,
NCB	John	11	36	, makes a statement that is at the heart of the Christian Faith : Christ will die for all , so that the entire human family may have life . The temple and Jewish tradition are now transcended by a worship and a salvation that are universal . - John 11:49 That year : i.e. , at that time . The Jews believed that the high priest possessed a gift of prophecy , which was at times unknowingly carried out ( see v.
NCB	John	11	37	But some of them remarked , “ He opened the eyes of the blind man . Why could he not have done something to prevent this man ’ s death ? ”
NCB	John	11	38	Again deeply moved , Jesus came to the tomb . It was a cave , with a stone closing the entrance .
NCB	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone. ” Martha , the dead man ’ s sister , said to him , “ Lord , by now there will be a stench , for he has been dead for four days. ”
NCB	John	11	40	Jesus replied , “ Did I not tell you that if you have faith you will see the glory of God ? ”
NCB	John	11	41	And so they removed the stone . Then Jesus looked up and said , “ Father , I thank you for hearing me .
NCB	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me , but I have said this for the sake of the people standing here , so that they may believe that it was you who sent me. ”
NCB	John	11	43	When he had said this , he cried out in a loud voice , “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
NCB	John	11	44	The dead man came out , his hands and feet bound with linen bands , and his face wrapped in a cloth . Then Jesus said to them , “ Untie him and let him go free. ”
NCB	John	11	45	One Man Must Die for the People . [ g ] This caused many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary , and had seen what Jesus did , to believe in him .
NCB	John	11	46	However , some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done .
NCB	John	11	47	As a result , the chief priests and the Pharisees summoned a meeting of the Sanhedrin and said , “ What are we going to do ? This man is performing many signs .
NCB	John	11	48	If we let him go on like this , everyone will start to believe in him , and then the Romans will come and suppress both our temple and our nation. ”
NCB	John	11	49	However , one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , [ h ] said to them , “ You know nothing at all .
NCB	John	11	50	You do not seem to realize that it is better for us that one man die for the people rather than the whole nation be destroyed. ”
NCB	John	11	51	) . - John 11:53 Jesus is placed under a death sentence , which the careful reader will suspect to be illegal because of Nicodemus ’ question to the authorities in Jn 7:51 : “ Does our Law allow us to pass judgment on someone without first giving him a hearing to ascertain what he is doing ? ” - John 11:54 Ephraim : on the edge of the wilderness of Judea ,
NCB	John	11	52	and not for the nation alone , but to gather into one the dispersed children of God .
NCB	John	11	53	And so from that day on , they plotted to kill him . [ i ]
NCB	John	11	54	As a result , Jesus no longer walked about openly among the Jews . He withdrew to a town called Ephraim [ j ] in the region bordering the desert , and he remained there with the disciples . The True Passover That Brings About the Salvation of Humankind [ k ] The Hour Has Come [ l ]
NCB	John	11	55	The Last Passover . [ m ] Now the Jewish Passover [ n ] was drawing near , and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover in order to purify themselves .
NCB	John	11	56	They kept looking for Jesus , and they asked one another as they stood in the temple , “ What do you think ? Will he come to the feast or not ? ”
NCB	John	11	57	Meanwhile , the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where he was should inform them so that they might arrest him . Footnotes - John 11:1 Unceasingly , Jesus attests that he has come to give life . The Resurrection is the sign that shows he came to give life . Death is no longer the last word on the human condition , and life now assumes an unusual stability ; it is filled with endless hope . - John 11:1 Death spares no one , not even friends of the Son of God . But unhurriedly and without fear , Jesus confronts it in order to liberate from it those he loves . Death can no longer be the final destination ; henceforth , it is simply a passage for which sleep is like a first image . The Gospel of Luke also speaks of the two sisters , Martha and Mary , but without naming their village ( Lk 10:38-42 ) ; we know from this passage that it was Bethany , and we also learn that they had a brother . Bethany was on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives , about two miles from Jerusalem . One notes the decision of Jesus to accomplish his work without hesitation even to the destiny established by his Father ( v.
NCB	John	12	12	The Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem . [ c ] The next day the great crowd of people who had come for the feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem .

NCB	John	12	2	Cor 4:4 ; Eph 2:2 ; 6:12 ) . - John 12:34 Law : taken here as the entire Old Testament ( see Jn 10:34 ) , and referring specifically to Pss 89:37 ; 110:4 ; Isa 9:7 ; Dan 7:14 . Son of Man : see notes on Jn 1:51 and Mt 8:20 . - John 12:37 The early Christian generations always remained astonished at Israel ’ s refusal of the light , and they meditated on the text of Isaiah on the blindness of people when faced with an unexpected work of God . To recognize the light is to choose to accept its demands . Such a choice turns a life upside down ; it is necessary to accept the risk of being marginalized from the usual social and religious milieu . - John 12:40 This text , like others in the Old Testament , appears to say that hardened hearts and blinded eyes are God ’ s doing . However , the evangelist is simply assuring Christian readers that even though God would give people every opportunity to convert , many would still choose to stay in their sin . - John 12:42 John is indicating that in the Israel of his time there is , as always , a remnant that believes . But they are not a true People of God because of their fear of being excommunicated by the authorities . - John 12:44 But who is the light ? It is Jesus himself , sent by the Father to make known the Father ’ s love and to save believers . All through the Gospel , Christ has testified how deeply aware he is of this mission because of the unity in which he lives with his Father . What Jesus says in these few verses sums up his entire teaching concerning his mission . - John 12:47 This parallels the statement found at the end of the Sermon on the Mount ( Mt 7:24-27 ) . Everything hangs upon a person ’ s acceptance or rejection of what Jesus has said .
NCB	John	12	3	Mary brought in a pint [ a ] of very costly ointment , made from pure nard , anointed Jesus ’ feet , and dried them with her hair . The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment .
NCB	John	12	4	Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , the one who was about to betray him , said ,
NCB	John	12	5	“ Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii [ b ] and the money given to the poor ? ”
NCB	John	12	6	He said this not because he had any concern for the poor but because he was a thief . He was in charge of the money bag , and he used to steal from it .
NCB	John	12	7	Jesus said in response , “ Leave her alone ! Let her keep it for the day of my burial .
NCB	John	12	8	The poor you will always have with you , but you will not always have me. ”
NCB	John	12	9	Meanwhile , a large number of Jews learned that he was there , and they came not only because of Jesus but also because they wanted to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead .
NCB	John	12	10	The chief priests then decided to put Lazarus to death as well ,
NCB	John	12	11	since it was because of him that many of the Jews were leaving and putting their faith in Jesus .
NCB	John	12	13	Thus , they went out to meet him , carrying branches of palm [ d ] and shouting , “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , the King of Israel. ”
NCB	John	12	14	Jesus found a young donkey and rode it , as it is written ,
NCB	John	12	15	“ Do not be afraid , daughter of Zion . [ e ] Behold , your King is coming , riding on a donkey ’ s colt. ”
NCB	John	12	16	At first , his disciples did not understand this , but later , when Jesus had been glorified , they recalled that these things had been written about him and had happened to him .
NCB	John	12	17	Now the people who had been present when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify about this . [ f ]
NCB	John	12	18	Because the crowd had heard that he had performed this sign , they went out to meet him .
NCB	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another , “ As you see , we are getting nowhere . The entire world has gone after him. ”
NCB	John	12	20	The Glory of the Cross . [ g ] Among those who had come up to worship at the feast were some Greeks . [ h ]
NCB	John	12	21	They approached Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and said to him , “ Sir , we would like to see Jesus .
NCB	John	12	22	Philip went to tell Andrew of this , and Philip and Andrew informed Jesus .
NCB	John	12	23	Jesus answered them , “ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
NCB	John	12	24	Amen , amen , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies , it remains just a grain of wheat . However , if it dies , it bears much fruit .
NCB	John	12	25	“ Anyone who loves his life loses it , but the one who hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life .
NCB	John	12	26	If anyone wishes to serve me , he must follow me . Where I am , there also will my servant be . If anyone serves me , my Father will honor that person .
NCB	John	12	27	“ Now my soul is troubled . Yet what should I say : ‘ Father , save me from this hour ’ ? No , it was for this that I have come to this hour .
NCB	John	12	28	Father , glorify your name. ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have glorified it , and I will glorify it again. ”
NCB	John	12	29	The crowd that was present heard this , and some of them said that it was thunder , while others asserted , “ An angel has spoken to him. ”
NCB	John	12	30	Jesus answered , “ This voice did not come for my sake but for yours .
NCB	John	12	31	Now is the judgment on this world . Now the prince of this world [ i ] will be driven out .
NCB	John	12	32	And when I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw all to myself. ”
NCB	John	12	33	He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die .
NCB	John	12	34	The crowd answered , “ Our Law [ j ] teaches that the Christ will remain forever . How then can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ”
NCB	John	12	35	Jesus replied , “ The light will be with you for only a little longer . Go on your way while you still have the light , so that the darkness will not overtake you . “ Whoever walks in the darkness does not know where he is going .
NCB	John	12	36	While you have the light , believe in the light so that you may become children of light. ” After Jesus had said this , he departed and hid himself from their sight .
NCB	John	12	37	The Choice To Believe in the Light . [ k ] Although he had performed so many signs in their presence , they did not believe in him .
NCB	John	12	38	This was to fulfill the word of the prophet Isaiah , “ Lord , who has believed our preaching ? To whom has the power of the Lord been revealed ? ”
NCB	John	12	39	They therefore could not believe for as Isaiah said ,
NCB	John	12	40	“ He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts , lest they see with their eyes and understand with their hearts , and thereby be converted , so that I could heal them. ” [ l ]
NCB	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw his glory , and his words referred to him .
NCB	John	12	42	Nevertheless , there were many , even among the authorities , who believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they did not confess their faith in him , for fear of being banned from the synagogue . [ m ]
NCB	John	12	43	For they valued human glory more highly than the glory that comes from God .
NCB	John	12	44	The Choice To Believe in Jesus . [ n ] Then Jesus cried out , “ Whoever believes in me believes not only in me but in him who sent me .
NCB	John	12	45	And whoever sees me sees the one who sent me .
NCB	John	12	46	I have come into the world as light so that everyone who believes in me may not have to remain in darkness .
NCB	John	12	47	[ o ] “ But if anyone listens to my words and fails to observe them , I will not pass judgment on him , for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world .
NCB	John	12	48	Anyone who rejects me and does not accept my words already has a judge . On the last day , the word that I have spoken will serve as his judge .
NCB	John	12	49	“ For I have not spoken on my own , but the Father who sent me has himself given me command about what I am to say and how I am to speak .
NCB	John	12	50	I know that his commandment is eternal life . Therefore , what I speak is what the Father has told me to say. ” Footnotes - John 12:3 Pint : Greek : litra , i.e. , about a half-liter . - John 12:5 Three hundred denarii : a year ’ s wages , a denarius being a day ’ s wages for a laborer . - John 12:12 To a greater degree than the Synoptics , the fourth Gospel describes this entry as a triumph and stresses above all the theme of the glory of Christ . The raising of Lazarus has provoked the enthusiasm of the crowd , and for the first time Jesus allows himself to be acclaimed “ King of Israel ” ; he lets himself be known as the King-Messiah announced by Zechariah ( 9:9 ) . - John 12:13 Branches of palm : customarily used in victory celebrations ( see
NCB	John	13	13	You call me ‘ Teacher ’ and ‘ Lord , ’ and rightly so , for that is what I am .
NCB	John	13	1	As the feast of Passover drew near , Jesus was aware that his hour had come to depart from this world and to go to the Father . He had loved his own who were in the world , and he loved them to the end .
NCB	John	13	2	The devil had already put it into the mind of Judas , son of Simon Iscariot , to betray Jesus . During supper ,
NCB	John	13	3	Jesus , fully aware that the Father had entrusted all things into his hands , and that he had come from God and was returning to God ,
NCB	John	13	4	got up from the table , removed his outer garments , and took a towel that he tied around his waist .
NCB	John	13	5	Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples ’ feet and to wipe them with the towel wrapped around his waist .
NCB	John	13	6	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Lord , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
NCB	John	13	7	Jesus answered , “ You do not understand now what I am doing , but later you will understand. ”
NCB	John	13	8	Peter said to him , “ You shall never wash my feet. ” Jesus replied , “ Unless I wash you , you will have no share with me. ”
NCB	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , then wash not only my feet , but also my hands and my head. ”
NCB	John	13	10	Jesus then said , “ Anyone who has bathed has no need to wash further , except for his feet , for he is clean all over . You also are clean , although not every one of you is clean. ”
NCB	John	13	11	He knew the one who was going to betray him . That is why he added the words , “ Not every one of you is clean. ”
NCB	John	13	12	After he had finished washing their feet and had once again put on his outer garments , he reclined at table and said to them , “ Do you understand what I have done for you ?
NCB	John	13	14	So if I , your Lord and Teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash one another ’ s feet .
NCB	John	13	15	“ I have given you an example . What I have done for you , you should also do .
NCB	John	13	16	Amen , amen , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him .
NCB	John	13	17	“ Now that you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them . Jesus Predicts His Betrayal [ c ]
NCB	John	13	18	“ I am not speaking about all of you . I know those whom I have chosen . However , what the Scripture says must be fulfilled , ‘ The one who ate bread with me has raised his heel against me. ’
NCB	John	13	19	“ I tell you this now , before it occurs , so that when it does occur , you may believe that I am . [ d ]
NCB	John	13	20	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever receives the one I send receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. ”
NCB	John	13	21	After saying this , Jesus was deeply distressed , and he declared , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , one of you will betray me. ”
NCB	John	13	22	The disciples looked at one another , puzzled as to which one of them he meant .
NCB	John	13	23	One of them , the disciple whom Jesus loved , was reclining at Jesus ’ side .
NCB	John	13	24	Simon Peter signaled to him to ask Jesus which one he meant .
NCB	John	13	25	Therefore , leaning back toward Jesus , he asked , “ Lord , who is it ? ”
NCB	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread after I have dipped it into the dish. ” And when he had dipped the piece of bread , he gave it to Judas , son of Simon Iscariot .
NCB	John	13	27	As soon as Judas had received the piece of bread , Satan entered into him . Jesus then said to him , “ Do quickly what you are going to do. ”
NCB	John	13	28	Now no one at the table knew why he had said this to him .
NCB	John	13	29	Some thought that since Judas was in charge of the money bag , Jesus was telling him to purchase what was needed for the feast , or to give something to the poor .
NCB	John	13	30	) . Now the drama of the Passion begins ; Jesus considers it the hour of his glory . He acts with a knowledge of the events that is the knowledge of God . Jesus is the Lord , as indicated by his title “ I AM. ” This attestation serves to make the faith of the disciples stronger . For the first time we meet “ the disciple whom Jesus loved ” ; we shall find this unusual “ name ” three more times : once beneath the cross ( Jn 19:26f ) , and the other two times in connection , once again , with Peter ( Jn 20:2-10 ; 21:20-22 ) . The tradition has always identified this disciple with John . - John 13:19 See note on Jn 4:26 . - John 13:33 Jesus is not the first to recommend friendship , mutual service , and brotherly affection . But to love as he loved goes so much further as to become an absolute . It is no doubt for the purpose of underlining this that the fourth Gospel puts the commandment to love in the context of farewells ; it likewise makes evident that this law of life is the most original sign of the community ’ s faithfulness to Christ . To love , to serve to the point of taking the last place and giving one ’ s life , goes beyond human strength . Perhaps the dialogue with Peter is there to say that good feelings are not enough and that it takes the grace given by the death of Christ to have such strength . - John 13:36 Peter ’ s denial is predicted in all four Gospels ( Mt 26:33-35 ; Mk 14:29-31 ; Lk 22:31-34 and here ) .
NCB	John	13	31	After Judas had departed , Jesus said , “ Now is the Son of Man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
NCB	John	13	32	If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him at once . A New Commandment [ e ]
NCB	John	13	33	“ My children , I will be with you only a short time longer . You will look for me , and , as I told the Jews , so I now say to you , ‘ Where I am going , you can not come. ’
NCB	John	13	34	“ I give you a new commandment : love one another . Just as I have loved you , so you should also love one another .
NCB	John	13	35	This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples : if you love one another. ”
NCB	John	13	36	Jesus Predicts Peter ’ s Denial . [ f ] Simon Peter said to him , “ Lord , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered , “ Where I am going , you can not follow me now , but you will follow me later on. ”
NCB	John	13	37	Peter said , “ Lord , why can I not follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you. ”
NCB	John	13	38	Jesus answered , “ Will you really lay down your life for me ? Amen , amen , I say to you , before the cock crows , you will have denied me three times . Footnotes - John 13:1 This is the first of three parts that can clearly be distinguished in Jn 13:1—17:26 . These pages constitute the best known section of the fourth Gospel , which at this point becomes the great book of meditation for Christians . The author develops a lengthy farewell address in the setting of the final meal . On the eve of his death , Christ lets his disciples know the deepest secrets of his love for God . The other two parts in this lengthy piece are : the community of the witnesses to Christ ( 15:1—16:33 ) and the priestly prayer of Jesus ( 17:1-26 ) . Scholars believe that the three parts probably reflect three redactional stages . - John 13:1 The story of the Last Supper is not told in John , and we shall never know exactly why , but the farewell meal here is described in the same spirit . By washing the feet of his disciples , Jesus performs the action of a slave ; love has indeed made him the servant of his friends . - John 13:18 The announcement of the betrayal of Jesus comes in the discourse that follows the washing of the feet . Jesus brings the crisis to a head . The traitor can no longer remain in the intimacy of the Lord , sharing his table and his confidences . The darkness must one day be separated from the light ( see v.
NCB	John	14	14	, where the themes are intermingled too numerously to discern the whole universe of meaning each verse opens to us . Yes , there is fulfillment , but it comes from God ; it is abiding in God , truth in God , life from God . The symbols tell us that the fulfillment comes about in the communication of life from the Father , from Jesus , and from the Spirit . - John 14:1 The departure of Jesus ought not to become a time of discouragement amid hostility or uncertainty . The departure opens to all people the possibility of being in communion with God . Jesus gives the disciples the light and the life to enter this communion : he is the way not only through his teaching but also through his presence and his being—but what do we call the way and the goal of life for us ? - John 14:1 You place your trust in God : this could also be translated as an imperative : “ Place your trust in God ! ” - John 14:6 We can reflect upon the mystery of God to struggle to develop a better understanding of our life and the meaning of the world . But our power to discern can not establish any certainties on our own . To know the Father , to discover what he wants for us , and to enter into his communion , we first have to look on Jesus , on his work , and on his love . Only the gift of the Son reveals the love of the Father in its fullness . - John 14:12 Here is a beautiful hymn on what it means to be Christians . They are not nostalgic survivors of a great experience that is past . In daily life , with its insults and interrogations , they remain in true communion with Christ and continue his work—i.e. , they bear in his name the testimony of salvation and the testimony of truth . This communion , unceasingly renewed , gives them strength to cope with attacks of despair , falsehood , incomprehension , and nothingness—what John often calls “ the world. ” In this effort , which is never finished , they are uplifted by a new and constant presence of God : the Spirit . It is the Spirit who gives Christians the power to experience the divine presence in their inmost being , because the Spirit makes them live in the participation of God . It is the Spirit who gives Christians the courage to obey , as Christ did , the will of God , who is love , truth , testimony . It is the Spirit who makes them penetrate the heart of the words and acts of Jesus in the questions and debates of life . The Spirit is the consoler of Jn 16:5-13 . The Greek word Parakletos means an advocate , one who aids by his power and advice . In the situations and struggles of living as a Christian , the Spirit supports us so that we may remain united with God and bear witness to him before the world . - John 14:22 Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) : Jude Thaddeus ( see Mt 13:15 ) . - John 14:27 Christ ’ s departure is imminent . Is the triumph over evil that the Passion effects merely a spectacle ? No , this departure expresses Christ ’ s free decision to do the will of the Father and to be at the Father ’ s side , which is his true state of being . Such is God ’ s peace , whose way and meaning are opened for believers . Yes , there is a fulfillment and a happiness for us—it is this that the word “ peace ” evokes in the Bible . It is not found in the satisfaction of the passions . True peace is a divine gift , to which Christ gives us access in our communion with God . - John 14:28 The Father is greater than I : this does not refer to the trinitarian relation between the Father and the Son . It probably refers to the fact that Jesus was sent by the Father and that the messenger ( in the Hebrew mentality ) is inferior to the one who sends him .

NCB	John	14	5	Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we do not know where you are going . How can we know the way ? ” Jesus , the Truth , Reveals the Father [ d ]
NCB	John	14	6	Jesus replied , “ I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me .

NCB	John	14	13	Whatever you ask in my name I will do , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
NCB	John	14	15	“ If you love me , you will keep my commandments .

NCB	John	14	18	“ I will not leave you orphans ; I will come to you .
NCB	John	14	19	In a little while , the world will no longer see me , but you will see me . Because I live , you also will live .

NCB	John	14	21	“ Anyone who has received my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me . And whoever loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him and reveal myself to him. ”
NCB	John	14	22	Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) [ f ] asked him , “ Lord , why is it that you are revealing yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
NCB	John	14	23	Jesus answered him , “ Whoever loves me will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our abode with him .
NCB	John	14	24	Whoever does not love me does not keep my words . And the word that you hear is not my own , but that of the Father who sent me .

Footnotes - John 14:1 Facing the death of Jesus , or facing our death , we might be shaken by fear . After all , without God is not existence for us a flight from the useless to nothingness ? We have , then , to meditate on this chapter
NCB	John	15	15	“ I shall no longer call you servants , because a servant does not know what his master is doing . I have called you friends because I have revealed to you everything that I have heard from my Father .
NCB	John	15	1	“ I am the true vine , and my Father is the vinegrower .
NCB	John	15	2	He removes every branch that does not bear fruit , and every branch that does he prunes to make it bear even more .
NCB	John	15	3	You have already been cleansed by the word I have spoken to you .
NCB	John	15	4	“ Abide in me , as I abide in you . Just as a branch can not bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine , so you can not bear fruit unless you abide in me .
NCB	John	15	5	“ I am the vine , you are the branches . Whoever abides in me , and I in him , will bear much fruit . Apart from me you can do nothing .
NCB	John	15	6	Whoever does not abide in me will be thrown away like a withered branch . Such branches are gathered up , thrown into the fire , and burned .
NCB	John	15	7	“ If you abide in me and my words abide in you , you may ask for whatever you wish , and it will be done for you .
NCB	John	15	8	By this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit and become my disciples .
NCB	John	15	9	“ As the Father has loved me , so have I loved you . Remain in my love .
NCB	John	15	10	If you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I have kept my Father ’ s commandments and remain in his love .
NCB	John	15	11	“ I have told you these things so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete . Love as Jesus Does [ c ]

NCB	John	15	13	to
NCB	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
NCB	John	15	16	, an image is used that suggests this mystery : the image of the vine and the branches . In these texts , love is above all a characteristic of the community itself . It is the Spirit who gives these groups the strength to exist as people of love and as witnesses of Christ . - John 15:1 Every reader of the Bible knows that the image of the vine suggests not only the union but also the tragic relationship between God and Israel . The Prophets rebuked the people of the Old Testament for not producing the fruit God expected of them , for being a spouse often unfaithful to her calling to bear witness to God among the nations ( see Isa 5:1-7 ; Jer 2:21 ; Ezek 19:10-14 ; Hos 10:1 ) . Jesus is the new Israel , the only vine that the Father has planted . This means that the radical , constitutive reality of the Church is her inclusion in Christ through Baptism , grace , and close attachment , and that any fruitfulness the disciple may have depends on this union with Christ . - John 15:12 There are many reasons for people to regroup : affinity , interest , defense . But the Christian community has only one reason : Christ and his choice of us . It also has only one way of life : to love like Christ , who went so far as to give his life . To have Christ ’ s love is a gift . Then prayer is not a delusion ; then the Christian community ’ s mission can bear fruit . The fruit has already been given : God ’ s love for us . In Christianity all is a gift . - John 15:18 The trial of Jesus , which the fourth Gospel unveils all through its pages , will not cease until the Father , to whom he is going , will have rendered justice to him in glorifying him . This drama , which people sometimes would like to conceal through reassuring words and sentiments , will not cease until the end of time . Persecution awaits Jesus , not because of some fatal error but because Christianity is different from what we want and claim it to be . The early Christians were excluded from the synagogue ; hatred and violence were stirred up against them under the guise of religion . Blindness and stubbornness : this is the world in the Johannine sense , the world of the persecutors . The Spirit is the strength and the light that assists the persecuted to hold fast in this affront , which no doubt also comes to pass in the heart of every believer .
NCB	John	15	17	, none of our usual words are pronounced ; People of God , Body of Christ , Church , congregation . The words preferred are : to abide in , to love , to testify . In ch .
NCB	John	15	18	“ If the world hates you , be aware that it hated me before it hated you .
NCB	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , the world would love you as its own . But you do not belong to the world because I have chosen you out of the world , and therefore the world hates you .
NCB	John	15	20	“ Remember the word that I said to you : ‘ a servant is not greater than his master. ’ If they persecuted me , they will persecute you . If they kept my word , they will keep yours as well .
NCB	John	15	21	But they will do all these things to you on account of my name , because they do not know the one who sent me .
NCB	John	15	22	“ If I had not come and spoken to them , they would not be guilty of sin , but now they have no excuse for their sin .
NCB	John	15	23	Whoever hates me hates my Father also .
NCB	John	15	24	If I had not done works among them that no one else had ever done , they would not be guilty of sin . But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father .
NCB	John	15	25	All this was to fulfill the word that is inscribed in their Law : ‘ They hated me without cause. ’
NCB	John	15	26	“ When the Advocate comes whom I will send you from the Father , the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father , he will testify on my behalf .
NCB	John	15	27	And you also are my witnesses because you have been with me from the beginning . Footnotes - John 15:1 To the Lord ’ s testament ( farewell discourse ) were added new instructions , as though to complete it . No doubt people did not want to lose other words of the Master , often meditated on , to explain the condition of the Christian community . It is the life of the community on which these chapters throw light . In this group of texts , chs .
NCB	John	16	16	“ In a little while you will no longer see me , and then a short time later you will see me again. ”
NCB	John	16	1	“ I have told you this to prevent you from falling away .
NCB	John	16	2	They will expel you from the synagogues . Indeed the hour is coming when anyone who kills you will believe that by doing so he is serving God .
NCB	John	16	3	And people will do such things because they have not known the Father or me .
NCB	John	16	4	But I have told you this so that when the hour arrives you may remember that I forewarned you about them . The Spirit of Truth , Our Guide to All Truth [ a ] “ I did not tell you all this previously because I was with you .
NCB	John	16	5	But now I am going away to the one who sent me . Not one of you asks me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
NCB	John	16	6	However , because I have told you this , you are overcome with grief .
NCB	John	16	7	“ Nevertheless , I am telling you the truth : it is better for you that I depart . For if I do not go away , the Advocate will not come to you , whereas if I go , I will send him to you .
NCB	John	16	8	“ And when he comes , he will prove the world wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment :
NCB	John	16	9	about sin , because they do not believe in me ;
NCB	John	16	10	about righteousness , because I am going to the Father and you will see me no longer ;
NCB	John	16	11	about judgment , because the ruler of this world has been condemned .
NCB	John	16	12	“ I have much more to tell you , but you would not be able to bear it now .
NCB	John	16	13	But when the Spirit of truth comes , he will guide you into all the truth . He will not speak on his own authority , but he will speak what he hears , and he will declare to you the things that are coming .
NCB	John	16	14	He will glorify me , for he will take what is mine and communicate it to you .
NCB	John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is mine . That is why I said that he will take what is mine and communicate it to you . Triumph of Jesus and the Joy of the Witnesses [ b ]
NCB	John	16	17	Then some of his disciples said to one another , “ What does he mean by saying to us , ‘ In a little while you will no longer see me , and then a short time later you will see me again , ’ and ‘ Because I am going to the Father ’ ?
NCB	John	16	18	What is this ‘ little while ’ ? We do not know what he means. ”
NCB	John	16	19	Jesus knew that they wanted to question him , so he said to them , “ You are asking one another what I meant by saying , ‘ In a little while you will no longer see me , and then a short time later you will see me again. ’
NCB	John	16	20	Amen , amen , I say to you , you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices . You will be sorrowful , but your grief will turn into joy .
NCB	John	16	21	“ A woman in labor suffers anguish because her hour has come . But when her baby is born , she no longer recalls the suffering because of her joy that she has brought a child into the world .
NCB	John	16	22	In the same way , you are now in anguish , but I will see you again , and your hearts will rejoice , and no one shall deprive you of your joy .
NCB	John	16	23	“ On that day , you will not ask me anything further . Amen , amen , I say to you , if you ask the Father for anything in my name , he will give it to you .
NCB	John	16	24	Until now , in my name , you have not asked for anything . Ask and you will receive , so that your joy may be complete .
NCB	John	16	25	“ I have used figures of speech to explain these things to you . The hour is coming when I will no longer use figures , but I will tell you about the Father in plain words .
NCB	John	16	26	When that day comes , you will make requests in my name . I do not say that I will entreat the Father on your behalf .
NCB	John	16	27	For the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have come to believe that I came from God .
NCB	John	16	28	I came from the Father and have come into the world . Now I am leaving the world and returning to the Father. ”
NCB	John	16	29	“ At last you are speaking plainly , ” his disciples said , “ and not using figures of speech .
NCB	John	16	30	Now we realize that you know everything and do not need to have anyone question you . Because of this , we believe that you came from God. ”
NCB	John	16	31	Jesus responded , “ Have you finally come to believe ?
NCB	John	16	32	I tell you , the hour is coming , indeed it has already come , when you will be scattered , each one going to his own home , and you will leave me alone . And yet I am not alone because the Father is with me .
NCB	John	16	33	“ I have told you this so that in me you may be in peace . In the world you will endure suffering . But take courage ! I have overcome the world. ” Footnotes - John 16:4 The disciples have to overcome sadness at the departure and absence of Jesus so that they may understand the meaning of the event : passage to glory , gift of the Spirit , and the beginning of a new era in the world . But until the end of history the trial of Jesus will not stop , and the disciples will have to testify to him in a world where unbelief appears unceasingly . The testimony of Christians can never stop ; such testimony does not depend on the intelligence and the strength of people but on the action of the Spirit , who unveils to Christians , in faith , the glory of Christ and the view that history takes of this light ( Christ ) . It is not a matter of a new revelation but of a discovery of what the words , actions , Death , and Resurrection of Jesus mean for each era : the truth of God that denounces the falsehood of sin , the goodness of God that denounces evil , and the condemnation of the forces that enslave people . The Spirit is the Paraclete : defender of Jesus in the heart of believers , defender of believers facing unbelief and refusal of the light—that is , the world in the sense the world is taken here ( Jn 15:5-15 ) . The Spirit is strength , support , light ( see Jn 14:16 ) . - John 16:16 The departure of Jesus will be a moment of disarray for the disciples ; his absence will more than once be a moment of disarray for believers . But that is not the last word . The sufferings , like the pains of giving birth , make a testimony fruitful . Let us rather look at the Death and Resurrection of Christ ; they are the definitive events in history . From the cross and Easter a new light is given to believers ; a new confidence with God is offered to them . Christ will be the mediator ; with him believers will be one with God . This intimacy will be a time of endless joy and peace for people who have believed they are children of God . What is the return of Christ ? Is it the glorious coming at the end of time or the Resurrection manifested in the appearances ? The two things go together . The Resurrection will inaugurate a new era , the last times ; and the end of time will manifest the glory of the Risen One .
NCB	John	17	17	“ Consecrate them in the truth . Your word is truth .
NCB	John	17	1	After saying this , Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said , “ Father , the hour has come . Glorify your Son , so that your Son may glorify you ,
NCB	John	17	2	since you have given him authority over all people , so that he may give eternal life to all those you have given him .
NCB	John	17	3	And eternal life is this : to know you , the only true God , and the one you have sent , Jesus Christ .
NCB	John	17	4	“ I have glorified you on earth by completing the work that you entrusted to me .
NCB	John	17	5	So now , Father , glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began . The Son and the Disciples [ c ]
NCB	John	17	6	“ I have made your name known to those whom you gave me from the world . They were yours , and you gave them to me , and they have kept your word .
NCB	John	17	7	Now they have come to understand that everything you gave me is from you .
NCB	John	17	8	For the words you gave to me I have given to them , and they have accepted them and know with certainty that I have come from you , and they have believed that you sent me .
NCB	John	17	9	“ It is for them that I pray . I do not pray for the world , but for those you gave me because they are yours
NCB	John	17	10	Everything I have is yours , and everything you have is mine , and through them I have been glorified .
NCB	John	17	11	I will remain no longer in the world , but they will still be in the world while I will be coming to you . “ Holy Father , protect by the power of your name those you have given me , so that they may be one , even as we are one .
NCB	John	17	12	While I was with them I protected them by your name that you have given me , and I kept them safe . Not one of them was lost , except the one destined to be lost , [ d ] so that the Scripture might be fulfilled .
NCB	John	17	13	“ Now I am coming to you , and I say these things while I am still in the world so that my joy may come to full measure in them .
NCB	John	17	14	I have given them your word , and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world .
NCB	John	17	15	I am not asking you to take them out of the world , but I do ask you to protect them from the evil one .
NCB	John	17	16	They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world .
NCB	John	17	18	As you sent me into the world , so have I sent them into the world .
NCB	John	17	19	And for their sakes I consecrate myself , so that they too may be consecrated in truth . The Disciples and the Church To Come [ e ]
NCB	John	17	20	“ I pray not only on behalf of these , but also for those who through their word will come to believe in me .
NCB	John	17	21	May they all be one . As you , Father , are in me and I in you , may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me .
NCB	John	17	22	“ The glory that you have given me I have given to them , so that they may be one , as we are one ,
NCB	John	17	23	I in them and you in me , that they may become completely one , and thus the world may know that you have sent me and that you have loved them even as you have loved me .
NCB	John	17	24	“ Father , allow those you have given me to be with me where I am , so that they may behold my glory , which you have bestowed on me because you loved me before the foundation of the world .
NCB	John	17	25	“ Righteous Father , the world has not known you ; I have known you , and they have known that you have sent me .
NCB	John	17	26	I have made your name known to them , and I will make it known , so that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them. ” Footnotes - John 17:1 The hour has come for Jesus to do the final action that shows how far his union with the Father reaches and how great is the gift he makes of himself to human beings for their salvation . This sublime prayer reveals the ultimate meaning of his sacrifice ; the title that has been given to the chapter , the “ priestly prayer , ” is well deserved . But it is also a “ missionary ” prayer , since at the moment when there seems to be nothing but failure and isolation , Jesus adheres to God ’ s plan . He is entirely the One Sent , who completes the mission given to him by the Father . He thinks only of this mission that his disciples must continue . - John 17:1 The word “ glory ” speaks of the greatness of God , of his final intervention , of his presence that gives strength , meaning , and fulfillment to people . Paradoxically , this glory is revealed in the destiny of Jesus , glory that is manifested during the Passion . One observes the love that was given to Christ for all eternity , love that became eternal life , shared by believers . - John 17:6 People who have accepted his word and recognized his truth live in close union with Jesus , which is a wonderful gift from the Father . Jesus calls for their fidelity . People who have accepted the words of Jesus are no longer trapped in worthlessness , emptiness , and falsehood—in everything that is a denial of God and what is here called “ the world. ” Their future is not in running away but in being insulted and giving testimony . The trial of Jesus continues in these people . May they remain in truth and faith ; may they not become a prey of the falsehood , worthlessness , and unbelief that are the face of the Evil One or of Evil . - John 17:12 The one destined to be lost ( literally , “ The son of perdition ” ) : Judas the traitor ( see Jn 13:18 ) . The literal translation reflects a Hebraism , meaning one who is destined for destruction , and this by his own free action . It is by this free choice that the Scripture is fulfilled . - John 17:20 The prayer of Jesus indicates the destiny of his followers for all times and places . He asks what is essential for them : that they live in the bonds of peace and unity that express their union with Christ . Here is the mystery of the Church in the light of the sacrifice of Christ : the Church is anchored in the inexpressible love of the Son and the Father ; this is the mystery of communion . Christians testify to this communion when they live in it . Hence , they will discover more and more , in terms of experience , who Christ is and who the Father is : the glory of Christ and the name of the Father will be unveiled to their eyes as the highest realities .
NCB	John	18	18	Since it was cold , the servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire , and they were standing around it , warming themselves . Peter was also standing there and warming himself .
NCB	John	18	1	After Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples and crossed the Kidron [ c ] valley . He and his disciples entered a garden there .
NCB	John	18	2	This place was known to Judas , his betrayer , because Jesus had often met there with his disciples .
NCB	John	18	3	Therefore , Judas went to that garden with a detachment of soldiers , [ d ] together with temple guards provided by the chief priests and the Pharisees , equipped with lanterns and torches and weapons .
NCB	John	18	4	Then Jesus , fully aware of everything that was going to happen to him , came forward and asked them , “ Whom are you looking for ? ”
NCB	John	18	5	They answered , “ Jesus the Nazorean. ” [ e ] Jesus replied , “ I am. ” Judas who betrayed him was standing with them .
NCB	John	18	6	When Jesus said to them , “ I am , ” they drew back and fell to the ground .
NCB	John	18	7	Again , he asked them , “ Whom are you looking for ? ” And they said , “ Jesus the Nazorean. ”
NCB	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I have told you that I am . If you are looking for me , let these men go. ”
NCB	John	18	9	This was to fulfill the word he had spoken , “ I did not lose any of those you gave me. ” [ f ]
NCB	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it and struck the high priest ’ s servant , slicing off his right ear . The servant ’ s name was Malchus .
NCB	John	18	11	Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back into its scabbard ! Am I not to drink the cup [ g ] that the Father has given me ? ”
NCB	John	18	12	Jesus and Peter at the Hour of Bearing Witness . [ h ] Then the detachment of soldiers , their commander , and the Jewish guards seized Jesus and bound him .
NCB	John	18	13	They took him first to Annas , the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the high priest that year .
NCB	John	18	14	It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was better for one man to die for the people .
NCB	John	18	15	) : John , the one “ whom Jesus loved. ” - John 18:19 It is not very probable that this nighttime inquiry before Annas , mentioned only by John , is the same as the trial before Caiaphas mentioned by the Synoptics ( at night by Mt and Mk and in the morning by Lk ) . - John 18:22 Jesus remains calm and self-restrained throughout the entire Passion . He responds to the guard ’ s aggressiveness with meekness , but he does not fail to defend the legitimacy of his behavior and to point out the injustice done to him . Hence , Christians ’ defense of their rights is compatible with meekness and humility ( see Acts 22:25 ) . - John 18:28 We should try to imagine the scene . A Roman official , Pontius Pilate , had been governor of restless Judea since A.D.
NCB	John	18	16	but Peter remained standing outside at the gate . The other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the woman who was in charge of the gate , and he brought Peter inside .
NCB	John	18	17	The woman said to Peter , “ Are you not one of this man ’ s disciples ? ” He replied , “ I am not. ”
NCB	John	18	19	The Inquiry before Annas . [ i ] The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching .
NCB	John	18	20	Jesus answered , “ I have spoken openly for the world to hear . I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews congregate . I have said nothing in secret .
NCB	John	18	21	Why do you ask me ? Interrogate those who heard what I said to them . They know what I said. ”
NCB	John	18	22	[ j ] When he had said this , one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus with his hand , saying , “ Is that any way to answer the high priest ? ”
NCB	John	18	23	Jesus replied , “ If I have spoken wrongly , testify to my error . But if I have spoken rightly , why did you strike me ? ”
NCB	John	18	24	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas , the high priest .
NCB	John	18	25	Peter ’ s Second and Third Denials . Meanwhile , as Simon Peter stood warming himself , he was asked , “ Are you not also one of his disciples ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not. ”
NCB	John	18	26	( we are now in the year
NCB	John	18	27	Again , Peter denied it . And at that very moment , a cock crowed .
NCB	John	18	28	Jesus Handed Over to Pilate . [ k ] Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium . [ l ] It was early in the morning , and they did not enter the praetorium in order to avoid becoming defiled and thus be able to eat the Passover meal .
NCB	John	18	29	Therefore , Pilate went out to them and asked , “ What charge do you bring against this man ? ”
NCB	John	18	30	) . He had two guiding principles : to keep public order at any cost , and not to compromise his own reputation with Emperor Tiberius . The Jewish authorities wanted to rid themselves of Jesus in a legal way , thereby saving their own good name . Jesus himself did not want to disappear in an uprising , but had decided to go forward even to torture and execution on the cross ( see Jn 18:32 ) . In seven successive steps , dealing now with the Jews , now with Jesus , the governor is led to seek , find , and proclaim the truth . Jesus is in fact innocent ; he claims the title of king , not in order to dominate but in order to give . This man , whose innocence the governor asserts three times and whom he wishes to set free , says that he is Son of God , and explains his present subordination to an earthly authority as a phase in a divinely willed plan over which the imperial official has no power ( Jn 19:10-11 ) . The Gospel notes that this event took place around midday on the day of Preparation for the Passover ; it was the hour when they began to slaughter the lambs for the feast . The new Passover , marking God ’ s deliverance of humanity , is at hand ; the new Passover Lamb is about to offer the true and final sacrifice . - John 18:28 Praetorium : the residence of the Roman procurator . Passover meal : unlike the members of the Sanhedrin , Jesus has already celebrated the Passover supper ( Mt 26:20-29 ) . - John 18:40 Barabbas . . . thief : the word for thief can also mean revolutionary ( see note on Mk 15:9 ) .
NCB	John	18	31	Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and judge him according to your law. ” The Jews replied , “ We are not allowed to put anyone to death. ”
NCB	John	18	32	This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die .
NCB	John	18	33	The First Hearing before Pilate . Then Pilate went back into the praetorium , and having summoned Jesus he asked him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ”
NCB	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Are you saying this on your own , or have others told you about me ? ”
NCB	John	18	35	Pilate said , “ Am I a Jew ? Your own people and the chief priests have handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
NCB	John	18	36	Jesus replied , “ My kingdom does not belong to this world . If my kingdom did belong to this world , my followers would have fought to prevent me from being handed over to the Jews . The fact is that my kingdom is not here. ”
NCB	John	18	37	Pilate then said to him , “ So you are a king ! ” Jesus answered , “ It is you who say that I am a king . For this was I born , and for this I came into the world : to testify to the truth . Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice. ”
NCB	John	18	38	Pilate responded , “ What is truth ? ” Barabbas Preferred to Jesus . Then , having said this , he went out again to the Jews and said , “ I find no evidence of a crime in this man .
NCB	John	18	39	But according to your custom , I release one prisoner to you at Passover . Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? ”
NCB	John	18	40	They shouted , “ Not this man , but Barabbas ! ” Now Barabbas was a thief . [ m ] Footnotes - John 18:1 Jesus does not submit passively to what happens ; he controls his life and his sufferings ; he even wills them and defines their meaning . The fourth Gospel , more than the others , emphasizes his sovereign freedom . Jesus is not , however , only pretending to share the human condition : he is a human being who suffers hostility , violence , and death , and the Passion Narrative demonstrates this . John , no less than the Synoptics , emphasizes the realistic character of the events ; in fact , some details are even peculiar to him . In the fourth Gospel , the Passion and cross are an exaltation or uplifting of Jesus , a glorification by the Father , and a manifestation of all his love for humanity . By traveling the way of the cross with full awareness and on his own initiative , Jesus makes the truth of God shine forth . - John 18:1 Fear and disgust have no place in this account of the arrest . From the beginning , Jesus manifests his sovereign liberty to enter upon the Passion ; it is his initiative and his destiny . The betrayal by Judas and his wicked cohorts can not take away the liberty of Jesus , any more than the violence of Peter can defend it . Jesus depends only on his Father ; he gives his life willingly . - John 18:1 Kidron : a brook , fed by the rains , divided the hill of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives . - John 18:3 Detachment of soldiers : this refers to a complement of Roman troops—either
NCB	John	18	600	( a cohort ) or
NCB	John	18	200	men , hinting at Roman complicity in the plot against Jesus even prior to his trial before Pilate . Lanterns and torches : these may stress that the hour of darkness has come . - John 18:5 Nazorean : this is the form found in Mt ( 2:23 and 26:71 ) and Acts ( e.g. , 2:22 ) , not the Nazarene of Mark . I am : probably intended by John as an expression of divinity ( see note on Jn 4:26 ) . - John 18:9 The citation may refer to Jn 6:39 ; 10:28 ; or 17:12 . - John 18:11 Cup : symbol of a person ’ s calling and , above all , of his tragic destiny ( “ lots ” were shaken in a cup ) ; here it signifies the bitter hour of the Passion ( see Mt 22:39 ) . - John 18:12 In the fourth Gospel , the trial before the Jewish authorities is told in a few swift strokes ; throughout his public ministry Jesus has spoken about his ministry and the mission he has undertaken ; the trial is already over . Annas , who appears here , was a high priest removed from office by the Romans , but by his influence he controlled Jewish life . Another disciple ( v.
NCB	John	19	19	Pilate also had an inscription written and fastened to the cross . It read , “ Jesus the Nazorean , King of the Jews. ” [ g ]
NCB	John	19	1	Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be scourged . [ a ]
NCB	John	19	2	The soldiers twisted together some thorns into a crown and placed it on his head , and they dressed him in a purple robe .
NCB	John	19	3	They kept going up to him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews , ” while striking him on the face repeatedly .
NCB	John	19	4	Once again , Pilate went out and said to the Jews , “ Look , I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no evidence of a crime in him. ”
NCB	John	19	5	Then Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe . Pilate said to them , “ Behold , the man ! ”
NCB	John	19	6	When they saw him , the chief priests and the temple guards shouted , “ Crucify him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and crucify him . I find no evidence of a crime in him. ”
NCB	John	19	7	The Jews answered , “ We have a Law , and according to that Law he ought to die because he has claimed to be the Son of God. ” The Second Hearing before Pilate .
NCB	John	19	8	Now when Pilate heard this , he was more frightened than ever .
NCB	John	19	9	Returning to the praetorium , he asked Jesus , “ Where are you from ? ” But Jesus offered no response .
NCB	John	19	10	Pilate then said to him , “ Are you refusing to speak to me ? Do you not realize that I have the power to release you and the power to crucify you ? ”
NCB	John	19	11	Jesus answered him , “ You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given to you from above . Therefore , the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin. ”
NCB	John	19	12	Jesus Is Condemned to Death . From that moment on , Pilate sought to release him , but the Jews kept shouting , “ If you release this man , you are no Friend of Caesar . [ b ] Everyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar. ”
NCB	John	19	13	When Pilate heard these words , he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge ’ s bench at a place known as the Stone Pavement [ c ] ( in Hebrew , “ Gabbatha ” ) .
NCB	John	19	14	It was the day of Preparation for the Passover , and it was about noon . [ d ] Pilate said to the Jews , “ Behold , your King ! ”
NCB	John	19	15	They shouted , “ Away with him ! Away with him ! Crucify him ! ” “ Am I to crucify your King ? ” Pilate asked them . The chief priests replied , “ We have no king but Caesar. ”
NCB	John	19	16	Then he handed him over to them to be crucified . Jesus Is Crucified . Then they took him away ,
NCB	John	19	17	and , carrying the cross [ e ] by himself , he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull ( in Hebrew , “ Golgotha ” ) .
NCB	John	19	18	There they crucified him [ f ] along with two others , one on either side , with Jesus in the middle .
NCB	John	19	20	This inscription , in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek , was read by many Jews , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city .
NCB	John	19	21	Therefore , the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ You should not write , ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but rather , ‘ This man claimed to be the King of the Jews. ’ ”
NCB	John	19	22	Pilate responded , “ What I have written , I have written. ” [ h ]
NCB	John	19	23	[ i ] When the soldiers had crucified Jesus , they took his clothes and divided them into four shares , one share for each soldier . They also took his tunic , which was woven seamless , top to bottom .
NCB	John	19	24	They said to one another , “ Instead of tearing it , let us cast lots for it to see who is to get it. ” In this way , the Scripture was fulfilled that says , “ They divided my garments among them , and for my clothing they cast lots. ” And that is what the soldiers did .
NCB	John	19	25	Mary and John at the Cross . Standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .
NCB	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her , he said to his mother , “ Woman , behold , your son. ”
NCB	John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple , “ Behold , your mother. ” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home .
NCB	John	19	28	Jesus Dies on the Cross . After this , aware that everything had now been completed , and in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled , Jesus said , “ I thirst. ”
NCB	John	19	29	A jar filled with sour wine was standing nearby , so they soaked a sponge in the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it up to his lips .
NCB	John	19	30	When Jesus had taken the wine , he said , “ It is finished. ” [ j ] Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit .
NCB	John	19	31	The Blood and the Water . It was the day of Preparation , and the Jews did not want to have the bodies remain on the cross on the Sabbath , especially since that Sabbath day was a great solemnity . Therefore , they requested Pilate to order that their legs be broken and the bodies taken down .
NCB	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and then of the other who had been crucified with him .
NCB	John	19	33	However , when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs ,
NCB	John	19	34	but one of the soldiers thrust a lance into his side , and immediately a flow of blood and water came forth .
NCB	John	19	35	An eyewitness has testified to this , and his testimony is true . He knows that what he says is true , so that you also may believe .
NCB	John	19	36	This happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled , “ Not one of his bones will be broken. ”
NCB	John	19	37	And again , in another passage Scripture says , “ They shall look on the one whom they have pierced. ”
NCB	John	19	38	Jesus Is Buried . [ k ] Shortly thereafter , Joseph of Arimathea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly , because of his fear of the Jews , asked Pilate for permission to remove the body of Jesus . Pilate granted him permission , and so he came and took his body away .
NCB	John	19	39	Nicodemus , who had first come to Jesus at night , also came , bringing with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds . [ l ]
NCB	John	19	40	They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths , in accordance with the burial custom of the Jews .
NCB	John	19	41	At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden , and in that garden there was a new tomb in which no one had ever been buried .
NCB	John	19	42	And so , since it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby , they laid Jesus there . Footnotes - John 19:1 Pilate was obviously hoping that a scourging would suffice for the Jews and he could then release Jesus . - John 19:12 Friend of Caesar : an honorific Roman title given to high officials for merit . - John 19:13 Stone Pavement : Greek , lithostrotos ; it has been identified with the great courtyard of the fortress Antonia , northeast of the temple , and therefore with the praetorium , the place or headquarters mentioned in Jn 18:28 . - John 19:14 Noon : literally , the sixth hour . See note on Mk 15:25 . - John 19:17 Carrying the cross : see note on Mk 15:21 . - John 19:18 Crucified him : see note on Mt 27:35 . - John 19:19 The inscription is found in all four Gospels under a slightly different form . John gives the most complete form , corresponding to the Latin of the three forms : INRI = IESU NAZARENUS REX IUDAEORUM ( “ Jesus the Nazorean , King of the Jews ” ) . See also note on Jn 18:5 . - John 19:22 What I have written , I have written : by this statement , Pilate affirms the truth of Jesus ’ divinity , which is rejected by his opponents . At the same time , Pilate stresses the inscription ’ s public and universal character—for it can be read by Jews ( Hebrew , i.e. , Aramaic ) , Greeks ( Greek ) , and Romans ( Latin ) . - John 19:23 To the last moment , Jesus retains a keen awareness that he is completing God ’ s work for the world , the will of God that all of the Scriptures ( so frequently cited ) proclaim . We see how Jesus ’ final gestures are symbols of the gifts given to humankind . In dividing the garments of the crucified man , the soldiers are careful not to tear the seamless tunic . By calling attention to this , John perhaps wishes to signify the unity that Christ leaves as a heritage to those whom he wills to save . Tradition identifies John with the beloved disciple ( see Jn 13:23 ; 20:2-10 ; 21:7-20 ; and compare Jn 1:35-39 ; 18:15 ) to whom Jesus entrusts his mother . As she did with the servants at Cana ( Jn 2:5 ) , Mary will teach the disciple how to follow the example and teaching of her Son . The passage suggests the maternal vocation of the Mother of Jesus in relation to all believers . The author bears witness to the fulfillment of the Scriptures . The words “ I thirst ” recall Ps 69:22 : “ In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. ” By drinking the sour wine offered to him , Jesus finishes the cup of his suffering ( Jn 18:11 ) . Jesus is pierced by a lance , immolated like the Passover lamb , the bones of which are not broken . From his opened breast spurt blood , the sign of life surrendered , and water , the sign of the Spirit that he gives to believers ( see Jn 7:38-39 ) . Spiritual meditation has taken these symbols further ; the blood and water are seen as prefigurations of the Eucharist and Baptism , the two Sacraments that form and feed the Church , this new Eve that has come forth from the opened side of the new Adam , Jesus Christ . All are called to the heart of the Redeemer where they can joyfully draw water from the fountain of salvation ( see Isa 12:3 ) . A privileged disciple , doubtless the beloved disciple once again , offers a special guarantee of the truth of the events and the richness of their meaning : in his mind it is a case not of the sad death of a human being but of the fulfillment of God ’ s plan , the shining forth of his love and his glory . - John 19:30 It is finished : this may correspond to the loud cry mentioned in Mt 27:50 and Mk 15:37 . Jesus died as a victor , completing what he came to accomplish . Gave up his spirit : a description of death that is out of the ordinary—it may suggest an act of will . - John 19:38 Some disciples , who until now were afraid to declare themselves , proceed to the burial of Jesus . According to Jewish custom , an executed criminal could not be put in a tomb where other people had already been buried ; to do so would have brought dishonor on them . But the sepulcher where Jesus is put is new in another sense perhaps—in it lies concealed the source of new life . - John 19:39 One hundred pounds : literally , “ a hundred litrai. ” Myrrh and aloes : possibly a fulfillment of Ps 45:9 .
NCB	John	20	20	After saying this , he showed them his hands and his side . The disciples were filled with joy when they saw the Lord .
NCB	John	20	1	Early on the first day of the week , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the tomb .
NCB	John	20	2	Therefore , she ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple , the one whom Jesus loved , and said to them , “ They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we don ’ t know where they have put him. ”
NCB	John	20	3	Then Peter and the other disciple set out and made their way toward the tomb .
NCB	John	20	4	They both were running , but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first .
NCB	John	20	5	He bent down and saw the linen cloths lying there , but he did not go in .
NCB	John	20	6	When Simon Peter caught up with him , he entered the tomb . He saw the linen cloths lying there ,
NCB	John	20	7	and also the cloth that had covered his head not lying with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place .
NCB	John	20	8	Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went inside , and he saw and believed .
NCB	John	20	9	They still did not understand the Scripture indicating that he must rise from the dead .
NCB	John	20	10	Then the disciples returned to their homes .
NCB	John	20	11	Mary Magdalene Recognizes Jesus . [ c ] Mary Magdalene remained weeping outside the tomb . And as she wept , she bent down to look into the tomb ,
NCB	John	20	12	and she saw two angels in white sitting there where the body of Jesus had been , one at the head and the other at the feet .
NCB	John	20	13	They asked her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She answered , “ They have taken my Lord away , and I do not know where they have put him. ”
NCB	John	20	14	As she said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there , but she did not realize that it was Jesus .
NCB	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you looking for ? ” Thinking he was the gardener , she said to him , “ Sir , if you have removed him , tell me where you have put him , and I will take him away. ”
NCB	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and said to him in Hebrew , “ Rabbouni ! ” [ d ] ( which means “ Teacher ” ) .
NCB	John	20	17	Jesus then said to her , “ Do not hold on to me , because I have not yet ascended to my Father . But go to my brethren and tell them , ‘ I am ascending to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ’ ” [ e ]
NCB	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene then went and announced to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord , ” and repeated what he had said to her .
NCB	John	20	19	Jesus Appears to the Disciples . [ f ] On the evening of that same day , the first day of the week , the doors of the house where the disciples had gathered were locked because of their fear of the Jews . Jesus then came and stood in their midst and said to them , “ Peace be with you. ”
NCB	John	20	21	“ Peace be with you , ” Jesus said to them again . “ As the Father has sent me , so I send you. ”
NCB	John	20	22	After saying this , he breathed on them and said , “ Receive the Holy Spirit .
NCB	John	20	23	If you forgive anyone ’ s sins , they are forgiven . If you retain anyone ’ s sins , they are retained. ”
NCB	John	20	24	Jesus Appears to Thomas . [ g ] Now Thomas , called the Twin , who was one of the Twelve , was not with the rest when Jesus came .
NCB	John	20	25	When the other disciples told him , “ We have seen the Lord , ” he replied , “ Unless I see the mark of the nails on his hands and put my finger into the place where the nails pierced and insert my hand into his side , I will not believe. ”
NCB	John	20	26	Eight days later , the disciples were again in the house , and on this occasion Thomas was with them . Although the doors were locked , Jesus came and stood in their midst , and he said , “ Peace be with you. ”
NCB	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here and see my hands . Reach out your hand and put it into my side . Do not doubt any longer , but believe. ”
NCB	John	20	28	Thomas exclaimed , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
NCB	John	20	29	Then Jesus said to him , “ You have come to believe because you have seen me . Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe. ”
NCB	John	20	30	Believe in Order To Live . [ h ] Now Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this work .
NCB	John	20	31	But those written here have been recorded so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that through your belief you may have life in his name . Footnotes - John 20:1 Here , as in the rest of his work , John is pleased to dwell on some incidents not set down , or at least barely noticed , by the Synoptics ; more than once , these are episodes involving the very person who is passing them on to his brethren in the faith . We owe to John the most extensive part of the Easter Gospel . By speaking of the empty tomb , he emphasizes the victory of life over death . When he describes one or other of the appearances , he wants to show how Jesus was recognized by his followers , what his new presence in their midst is like , how we are to believe in Christ , the mission to be carried out in the world in order to bear witness to him , and the gift of the Spirit to all believers . The last chapter , which has every appearance of having been added by disciples to the first edition of John ’ s Gospel , emphasizes and expands the ecclesial perspective : The Resurrection , which ends the earthly career of Jesus , begins the earthly career of the Church . - John 20:1 Why is the body no longer there and why are the linen cloths still there ? The beloved disciple , who had come with Peter , becomes the witness of the event and its meaning . Because he looks at the linen cloths with faith , he understands them as belonging to God ’ s plan : the linen cloths mean that Jesus is alive . The tomb is the symbol of death , but in the presence of this tomb the sign of death is changed . We are here at the beginning of a new life . Death is overcome . - John 20:11 To Mary Magdalene everything has been taken away , even the mortal remains of the One who has just died . But the appearance of the living Christ stands out in bold relief before her . And nothing is as it was before . The time of privileged encounters and sensible presence is past . The joy of Mary will be to announce to the disciples this new Covenant : Jesus lives with the Father , who is our Father , too . Believers are brothers and sisters of Jesus . Here lies the mystery of the Church—that is , in the communion with Jesus . - John 20:16 Rabbouni is more solemn than “ Rabbi ” ; it means “ My Teacher. ” - John 20:17 Jesus tells Mary Magdalene not to delay . She must immediately go and announce his Resurrection to the disciples , while he will ascend to the Father before returning to manifest himself to them in full possession of all his prerogatives as the firstborn among many brothers . He had foretold that his glorification was necessary in order for the Holy Spirit to be sent . Hence , for John , the Ascension takes place on the same day as the Resurrection . The external and more demonstrative Ascension described in the Acts of the Apostles ( 1:6-11 ) , forty days after the Resurrection , was only Jesus ’ sensible and definitive departure from the disciples after the various appearances to sustain and confirm their faith . - John 20:19 This is the first “ Sunday ” of the Church , the day on which the risen Lord meets his disciples . The season of joy has come ( see Jn 15:11 ; 16:20-24 ; 17:13 ) . He who comes , alive , into the midst of his followers is the same one who took on himself the suffering of the cross . He will now make them preachers of his mystery and ministers of his forgiveness . He sends the Spirit upon them as the Spirit had been sent on him by the Father at his Baptism , when he was beginning his mission ( see also Ezek 37:9 ; Jn 15:26-27 ) ; this marks the beginning of the apostolic mission , which is a continuation of the work of Jesus Christ . - John 20:24 The true happiness of the disciples was not to have seen the Lord but to have understood the meaning of his Passion . The Passion makes known God ’ s love . Blessed are they who believe in this love . Christian generations who have not known the visible Christ will meet him in faith . - John 20:30 The purpose of John ’ s Gospel was to bring people to belief in Jesus : there is life only in communion with him . These verses undoubtedly constituted the first conclusion of the fourth Gospel .
NCB	John	21	21	When Peter saw him , he said to Jesus , “ Lord , what about him ? ”
NCB	John	21	1	Some time later , Jesus once again revealed himself to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias , in the following manner .
NCB	John	21	2	) , although they had not begun to experience the time of the Church . We no longer have the same preoccupation . However , the response made by Jesus still holds : what is important is to follow Christ faithfully . - John 21:24 The faith of believers is a grace , but it goes back in history to those who were witnesses : those who saw the deeds and understood their meaning . Nonetheless , the life of Jesus goes beyond everything that can be written or said about him , even in a Gospel . Opening or closing the sacred writing , we are brought back to the encounter with Christ himself .
NCB	John	21	3	Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going out to fish. ” The others replied , “ We will go with you. ” They set off and got into the boat , but that night they caught nothing .
NCB	John	21	4	Shortly after daybreak , Jesus was standing on the shore , but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus .
NCB	John	21	5	Jesus called out , “ Children , have you caught anything ? ” When they answered , “ No , ”
NCB	John	21	6	he said to them , “ Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something. ” They did so , and they were unable to haul the net on board because of the great number of fish .
NCB	John	21	7	Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord. ” When Simon Peter heard him say that it was the Lord , he wrapped his outer garment around him , for he had taken it off , and jumped into the sea .
NCB	John	21	8	The other disciples came in the boat , towing the net full of fish , for they were not far from land , only about one hundred yards .
NCB	John	21	9	When they came ashore , they saw a charcoal fire there , with fish on it , and bread .
NCB	John	21	10	) . Catholic tradition has seen in this passage the fulfillment of the promise made at Caesarea Philippi : “ I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven ” ( Mt 16:17-19 ; see also Lk 22:31-32 ) . The First Vatican Council made reference to vv . 15-17 in its definition that Jesus appointed Peter supreme shepherd and ruler over the whole flock . - John 21:20 Peter will ultimately make the supreme sacrifice , but what will become of the beloved disciple of whom the fourth Gospel often speaks ( Jn 13:23 ; 19:26-27 ; 20:2-10 ; see Jn 1:35-39 ; 18:15 ) ? The first Christian generations still believed in the imminent return of Christ in glory (
NCB	John	21	11	Simon Peter went on board and dragged the net ashore , full of large fish , one hundred and fifty-three of them . Even though there were so many , the net was not torn .
NCB	John	21	12	Jesus then said to them , “ Come and have breakfast. ” None of the disciples dared to ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew that it was the Lord .
NCB	John	21	13	Jesus then came forward , took the bread , and gave it to them , and likewise the fish .
NCB	John	21	14	This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to his disciples after his resurrection from the dead .
NCB	John	21	15	Jesus and Peter . [ b ] When they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” He replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed my lambs. ”
NCB	John	21	16	Jesus said to him again , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” He replied , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Tend my sheep. ”
NCB	John	21	17	Jesus said to him a third time , “ Simon , son of John , do you love me ? ” Peter was hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time , “ Do you love me ? ” “ Lord , ” he said to him , “ you know everything . You know that I love you. ” Jesus said to him , “ Feed my sheep .
NCB	John	21	18	“ Amen , amen , I say to you , when you were young you used to fasten your own belt and you would go wherever you wished . But when you grow old , you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will put a belt around you and take you where you do not wish to go. ”
NCB	John	21	19	He said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God . After this , he said to him , “ Follow me. ”
NCB	John	21	20	The Beloved Disciple . [ c ] Peter looked around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them—the one who had reclined next to Jesus at the supper and had asked , “ Lord , who is it that will betray you ? ”
NCB	John	21	22	Jesus replied , “ If it should be my will that he remain until I come , how does that concern you ? Follow me ! ”
NCB	John	21	23	The saying then spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die . However , Jesus had not said to Peter , “ He will not die , ” but , “ If it should be my will that he remain until I come , how does that concern you ? ”
NCB	John	21	24	Signature of the Redactors . [ d ] This is the disciple who testifies to these things and has written them , and we know that his testimony is true .
NCB	John	21	25	But there are also many other things that Jesus did ; and if every one of them was recorded , I do not think the world itself could contain the books that would be written . Footnotes - John 21:1 This miraculous catch is the final “ sign ” given by Jesus . He does not reveal himself ; he remains mysterious , but the true disciple is able to recognize him ( see Jn 21:20 ) . - John 21:15 In this touching dialogue , Christ makes Peter a sign of his own perennial presence with his followers as their Good Shepherd ( see ch .

NCB	Romans	1	10	always asking that by God ’ s will I may somehow be granted my desire of coming to visit you .
NCB	Romans	1	11	For I am longing to see you so that I may bestow on you some spiritual gift to strengthen you—
NCB	Romans	1	12	or , rather , so that we may be mutually encouraged by each other ’ s faith , both yours and mine .
NCB	Romans	1	13	I want you to be aware , brethren , [ f ] that I have often planned to visit you ( although until now I have been prevented from doing so ) because it has been my desire to achieve some harvest among you as I have among other Gentiles .
NCB	Romans	1	14	) signifies here that the pagans had not received Greek culture . - Romans 1:13 Brethren : all those ( both men and women ) who believe in the Gospel are kin of Paul ( see Rom 4:3 ) . - Romans 1:14 Greeks and non-Greeks : literally , “ Greeks and barbarians. ” The “ Greeks ” were all who spoke Greek or followed the Greek way of life ; the “ non-Greeks ” were all the other Gentiles to whom Paul preached . - Romans 1:16 This extremely dense paragraph sums up the entire Letter . When we hear the word “ gospel ” we should not think of a book , but of the proclamation of salvation through faith . The citation in v.
NCB	Romans	1	15	Thus , I am ready to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome . The Gospel of God [ h ]
NCB	Romans	1	16	Power of Salvation for All Believers . For I am not ashamed of the gospel , since it is the power of God that offers salvation to everyone who has faith—to Jews first , and then to Gentiles as well .
NCB	Romans	1	17	from the prophet Habakkuk ( 2:4 ) , each word of which here takes on a Christian value , constitutes the theological pivot of the entire Letter . - Romans 1:17 Beginning in faith and established in faith : literally , “ from faith to faith , ” i.e. , by an ever more perfect faith . But other interpretations have been given . - Romans 1:18 In comparison with the liberation brought by the Gospel , humanity apart from Christ and without grace seems to be filled with sin and alienation . Paul begins by sketching a grim picture of the world as a prison and of the darkness in which human beings walk , whether Jews or Gentiles , who have abandoned themselves to their passions and to their own vain efforts ( Rom 1:18—3:20 ) . But into this world that is without vitality or a future , the love of God bursts forth and brings liberation . This conviction is central to the section . And this justification is given to whoever believes in Christ ( Rom 3:20-31 ) . What does “ believe ” mean ? Paul explains it at length , using what he regards as the magnificent example of Abraham ( Rom 4:1-25 ) . - Romans 1:18 Without Christ the world goes astray and can not reach its goal , which is God . It is under “ the wrath of God , ” an Old Testament phrase that indicates the ineradicable opposition between God and evil ( see Isa 9:11-20 ; 10:4 ; 30:27 ) . Thus , the world is a victim of corruption , of its useless efforts , of its lack of a sense of sin . Paul is especially sensitive to this situation and paints the dark scene on two panels : an indictment against paganism and a statement on the failure of Judaism . Neither paganism nor Judaism can save human beings . - Romans 1:26 See note on
NCB	Romans	1	18	; Isa 41:8-9 ; 42:1 ) . Apostle : one especially commissioned by Christ ( see note on Mk 6:30 ) . Gospel : see note on Mk 1:1-8 . The word Gospel occurs with special frequency in the collection of Paul ’ s Letters (
NCB	Romans	1	19	For that which can be known about God is clearly evident to them because God has revealed it plainly to them .
NCB	Romans	1	20	Ever since the creation of the world the invisible attributes of God ’ s eternal power and divine nature have been clearly understood and perceived through the things he has made . Therefore , the conduct of these people is inexcusable .
NCB	Romans	1	21	Despite knowing God , they refused to honor him as God or give thanks to him . As a result , their speculations became foolish and their uncomprehending hearts became darkened .
NCB	Romans	1	22	Although they claimed to be wise , in reality they became fools ,
NCB	Romans	1	23	exchanging the glory of the immortal God for images fashioned in the likeness of a mortal man or birds or fourfooted animals or reptiles .
NCB	Romans	1	24	Therefore , God abandoned them in the sinful lusts of their hearts to impurity and the mutual degradation of their bodies .
NCB	Romans	1	25	They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and offered worship and service to the creature rather than to the Creator , who is blessed forever . Amen .
NCB	Romans	1	26	[ l ] That is why God abandoned them to their shameful passions . Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural practices .
NCB	Romans	1	27	Likewise , men gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another . Men committed shameful acts with men and received in their own persons the fitting penalty for their perversion .
NCB	Romans	1	28	Furthermore , since these people did not see fit to acknowledge God , he abandoned them to their depraved way of thinking and to all types of vile behavior .
NCB	Romans	1	29	As a result , they are filled with every kind of wickedness , evil , greed , and malice . Reveling in envy , murder , strife , deceit , and malice , they are gossips ,
NCB	Romans	1	30	slanderers , God-haters , insolent , arrogant , and boastful , as they devise new ways of doing evil and rebel against their parents .
NCB	Romans	1	31	They are senseless , faithless , heartless , and ruthless .
NCB	Romans	1	32	Although they are fully cognizant of God ’ s decree that those who behave in this way deserve to die , they not only do these things themselves but also praise all those who engage in such conduct . Footnotes - Romans 1:1 Paul : in accord with ancient custom , Paul puts his name at the beginning of the Letter ; for information about Paul , see Acts 9:1ff ; Phil 3:4-14 ; and the Introductionto his Letters . Servant : literally , (
NCB	Romans	1	40	times ) . - Romans 1:2 Prophets : not just the writers of the Prophetic Books of the Bible but the whole Old Testament , which prophesied about Jesus ( see Lk 24:27 ,
NCB	Romans	1	44	) . Holy Scriptures : the Old Testament . - Romans 1:3 An early Christian profession of faith that proclaims Jesus ’ sonship as the Messianic descendant of David ( see Mt 22:42 ;
NCB	Romans	2	2	We are all aware that God ’ s judgment on those who commit such deeds is just .
NCB	Romans	2	1	Therefore , you have no excuse , whoever you may be , when you pass judgment on others . For in judging others you condemn yourself , since you are doing the same things .
NCB	Romans	2	3	How can you then suppose that you will escape the judgment of God for doing such things when you are condemning those who perform the same things ?
NCB	Romans	2	4	How can you despise the riches of God ’ s kindness and forbearance and patience ? How can you fail to realize that his kindness is meant to lead you to repentance ?
NCB	Romans	2	5	By your obstinate refusal to repent you are storing up retribution for yourself on the day of wrath when God ’ s righteous judgment will be revealed .
NCB	Romans	2	6	For God will repay everyone in accordance with what his deeds deserve . [ a ]
NCB	Romans	2	7	To those who seek after glory and honor and immortality by persevering in good works , he will grant eternal life .
NCB	Romans	2	8	But for those who are slaves to selfish ambition and follow the path of wickedness and not of truth , wrath and fury will be their lot .
NCB	Romans	2	9	There will be affliction and distress for everyone who does evil—Jews first and then Gentiles .
NCB	Romans	2	10	However , glory , honor , and peace await everyone who does good—Jews first , and then Gentiles .
NCB	Romans	2	11	For God shows no partiality . [ b ]
NCB	Romans	2	12	The Law and Conscience . [ c ] All those who have sinned outside the Law will perish outside the Law , and all who sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law .
NCB	Romans	2	13	For it is not those who hear the Law who are justified by God ; rather , it is those who observe the Law who will be justified .
NCB	Romans	2	14	Therefore , when Gentiles , who do not have the Law , act by nature in conformity with the Law , they are a law for themselves , even though they have no Law .
NCB	Romans	2	15	They show that the requirements of the Law are inscribed in their hearts ; and their own conscience will also bear witness for them , since their conflicting thoughts will accuse or even defend them [ d ]
NCB	Romans	2	16	on the day when , according to the gospel , God will judge the thoughts of all through Jesus Christ .
NCB	Romans	2	17	[ e ] You call yourself a Jew and rely on the Law and are proud of your relationship to God ,
NCB	Romans	2	18	and you know his will and are able to distinguish between right and wrong because you have been instructed in the Law ,
NCB	Romans	2	19	and you are confident that you are a guide to the blind , a light for those in darkness ,
NCB	Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish , and a teacher of the simple because in the Law you have the embodiment of knowledge and truth .
NCB	Romans	2	21	You , then , who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , are you yourself a thief ?
NCB	Romans	2	22	You who forbid adultery , are you yourself an adulterer ? You who abhor idols , do you commit sacrilege ?
NCB	Romans	2	23	You who boast of the Law , do you dishonor God by breaking it ?
NCB	Romans	2	24	As it is written , “ Because of you the name of God is reviled among the Gentiles. ”
NCB	Romans	2	25	Circumcision and the Heart . [ f ] Circumcision has value if you obey the Law . However , if you break the Law , you have become as if you had never been circumcised .
NCB	Romans	2	26	In the same way , if one who is not circumcised keeps the precepts of the Law , will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision ?
NCB	Romans	2	27	Then the man who is not physically circumcised but nevertheless observes the Law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the Law .
NCB	Romans	2	28	A man is not a Jew who is only one outwardly , nor is true circumcision external and physical .
NCB	Romans	2	29	Rather , the Jew is one who is a Jew inwardly , and true circumcision is of the heart—spiritual , not literal . He receives his praise not from human beings but from God . Footnotes - Romans 2:6 Will repay everyone in accordance with what his deeds deserve : a combination of Ps 62:12 and Prov 24:12 from the Septuagint ( the Greek translation of the Old Testament ) . - Romans 2:11 God shows no partiality : a basic teaching of both the Old and the New Testament ( see Deut 10:17 ) . - Romans 2:12 This passage is an important one for theology : God speaks to all human beings through the law of conscience ; the authentic virtues and the interior resistances of the Gentiles bear witness to this fact . - Romans 2:15 Paul takes up and develops the teaching of Jer 31:33 and Wis 17:11 . - Romans 2:17 In the original , the sentence is left incomplete ; it has been translated in a way that makes it complete . - Romans 2:25 For Israel , circumcision was the sign of its covenant with God ; to receive it was to belong to the People of God , and the Jews were proud of it . But was the rite enough , when the person did not live the reality that the rite signified ? The Prophets had long been criticizing formalism and calling for a religion of the heart ( see Jer 4:4 ; 9:24-25 ; Lev 26:41 ; Deut 10:16 ; 30:6 ; Sir 35:1-10 ; Dan 3:36-40 ; Phil 3:3-7 ) .
NCB	Romans	3	3	What if some were unfaithful ? Will their lack of faith nullify the fidelity of God ?
NCB	Romans	3	1	Is there any advantage , therefore , in being a Jew ? Or what is the value of circumcision ?
NCB	Romans	3	2	A great deal in every respect . In the first place , they were entrusted with the words of God .
NCB	Romans	3	4	By no means ! God must be true even if every human being is a liar , [ a ] as it is written , “ That you may be justified in your words , and vindicated when you are judged. ”
NCB	Romans	3	5	But if our wickedness serves to confirm the righteousness of God , what are we to say ? Is God unjust ( I speak of him in human terms ) to bring retribution upon us ?
NCB	Romans	3	6	Of course not ! For that would imply that God could not judge the world .
NCB	Romans	3	7	But if , as a result of my falsehood , God demonstrates his truthfulness , to his greater glory , why am I still being condemned as a sinner ?
NCB	Romans	3	8	And why not say , as some people slanderously accuse us of proposing , “ Let us do evil so that good may result ” ? Such people deserve their condemnation . The Whole World Guilty before God . [ b ]
NCB	Romans	3	9	Well , then , are we any better ? [ c ] No , not at all . For we have already charged that both Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin .
NCB	Romans	3	10	As it is written , “ There is no one who is righteous , not even one .
NCB	Romans	3	11	There is no one who has understanding , there is no one who seeks God .
NCB	Romans	3	12	All have turned away ; together they have become worthless . There is no one who shows kindness , not even one .
NCB	Romans	3	13	Their throats are open graves ; they use their tongues to deceive . The venom of vipers is on their lips ;
NCB	Romans	3	14	their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness .
NCB	Romans	3	15	Their feet hasten to shed blood ;
NCB	Romans	3	16	) . It was sprinkled with the blood of animals , as though to atone for collective sin . By giving his life , Christ really freed the people from sin and brought them God ’ s forgiveness .
NCB	Romans	3	17	The way of peace they do not know ;
NCB	Romans	3	18	there is no fear of God before their eyes. ”
NCB	Romans	3	19	Now we know that what the Law says is addressed to those who are under the Law , so that every mouth may be silenced and the entire world may be seen as guilty before God .
NCB	Romans	3	20	For no one can be regarded as justified in the sight of God by keeping the Law . The Law brings only the consciousness of sin . The Redemption in Jesus Christ [ d ]
NCB	Romans	3	21	God ’ s Righteousness through Faith in Jesus Christ . [ e ] But now the righteousness of God that is attested by the Law and the Prophets has been manifested apart from law :
NCB	Romans	3	22	the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe . No distinction has been made .
NCB	Romans	3	23	For all have sinned and thereby are deprived of the glory of God ,
NCB	Romans	3	24	and all are justified by the gift of his grace that is given freely through the redemption in Christ Jesus .
NCB	Romans	3	25	God designated him to be a sacrifice of expiation of sin through faith by the shedding of his blood because in his divine forbearance he allowed to be unpunished the sins previously committed .
NCB	Romans	3	26	He thus demonstrated his righteousness in the present time so that he might show himself to be just as the one who justifies anyone who has faith in Jesus .
NCB	Romans	3	27	Justification through Faith Apart from the Works of the Law . What reason then does one have to boast ? It is excluded ! By works of the Law ? No , rather by the law of faith .
NCB	Romans	3	28	For we maintain that one is justified by faith apart from the works of the Law .
NCB	Romans	3	29	Is God the God only of the Jews ? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles ? Yes , he is the God of the Gentiles too ,
NCB	Romans	3	30	since there is only one God , and he will justify both the circumcised and the uncircumcised on the basis of their faith .
NCB	Romans	3	31	Are we thereby nullifying the Law by this faith ? By no means ! On the contrary , we are upholding the Law . Footnotes - Romans 3:4 Every human being is a liar : these words are taken from Ps 116:11 LXX ; the rest of the verse comes from Ps 51:6 LXX . - Romans 3:9 To ensure the solidity of his inquiry concerning the universal reign of sin , Paul applies the Biblical proof to it . In the manner of the rabbis , he offers several citations on human corruption from the Psalms and the Book of Isaiah ( the references are—in the order of the citations—Pss 14:1-3 ; 5:9 ; 140:4 ; 10:7 ; Isa 59:7-8 ; Pss 36:1 ; 143:2 ) . Paul has led us in this descent into the hell of sin , in which humankind lies impotent , in order to enable us to appreciate the greatness of redemption and the necessity of faith . - Romans 3:9 Are we any better ? : i.e. , are Jews better than Gentiles in God ’ s sight ? - Romans 3:21 By dying on the cross , Jesus Christ publicly manifested the justice of God , that is , the faithful fulfillment of what God had promised for the salvation of every human being . - Romans 3:21 Sacrifice of expiation alludes to the cover of the ark , known as the “ propitiatory , ” which played an important role in the Jewish ritual of the Day of Atonement ( Lev
NCB	Romans	4	4	Now when a man works , his wages are not regarded as a gift but as something that is due to him .
NCB	Romans	4	1	What then are we to say about Abraham , our ancestor according to the flesh ?
NCB	Romans	4	2	If Abraham was justified by the works he did , he has good reason to boast , but not in the eyes of God .
NCB	Romans	4	3	For what does Scripture say ? “ Abraham placed his faith in God , and it was credited to him as righteousness. ” [ c ]
NCB	Romans	4	5	However , when someone who does not work places his faith in one who justifies the godless , such faith is reckoned as righteousness .
NCB	Romans	4	6	[ d ] In the same way , David speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God attributes righteousness apart from works :
NCB	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are blotted out .
NCB	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes no guilt. ” Justified before Being Circumcised . [ e ]
NCB	Romans	4	9	Is this blessedness granted only to the circumcised , or does it apply to the uncircumcised as well ? We have asserted that Abraham ’ s faith “ was credited to him as righteousness. ”
NCB	Romans	4	10	How was it credited ? Was it when he was circumcised or uncircumcised ? Not when he was circumcised , but when he was uncircumcised .
NCB	Romans	4	11	Abraham received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised . In this way , he was the father of all who believe without being circumcised and who thus have righteousness credited to them .
NCB	Romans	4	12	Therefore , he is the father of the circumcised who have not only received circumcision but also follow that path of faith traversed by Abraham before he was circumcised .
NCB	Romans	4	13	Justified Apart from the Law . [ f ] It was not through the Law that Abraham and his descendants received the promise that he would inherit the world , but through the righteousness of faith .
NCB	Romans	4	14	If those who live by the Law are the heirs , faith is null and the promise is void .
NCB	Romans	4	15	For the Law produces only wrath , and where no Law exists , there can not be any violation .
NCB	Romans	4	16	Therefore , the promise depends on faith , so that it may be a free gift and the promise may be guaranteed to all descendants , not only to the adherents of the Law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham . For he is the father of all of us ,
NCB	Romans	4	17	) . Circumcision is the external mark of the Covenant—not the source of righteousness . It is faith that links Christ to the chosen people , who are neither Jews nor Gentiles . - Romans 4:13 Abraham owes nothing to the Law , for this came into force a long time after him ( see Gal 3:17 ) . Moreover , no law can do anything but “ lay bare ” sin and condemn the sinner ( see Gal 3:10 ) . Now , the promise of salvation is something else—it is a grace of God . In Abraham , it is assured to all who believe . Thus , all believers have access to the historic plan of God , and Paul loves to celebrate the universality of faith . - Romans 4:18 God is the “ Master of the Impossible ” ; he is even powerful enough to bring about the raising of a dead person . It is in such certitude that believers live . Abraham believed in the word of the Lord who announced that two “ dead ” bodies , i.e. , sterile people , himself and Sarah , would give life to Isaac ( Gen 15:5 ) . Moreover , circumstances called into question the fulfillment of the promise ; yet Abraham—ever the father of believers—never doubted . Thus , he shared the condition of Christians who steadfastly believe in Life because they believe in the risen Jesus , the Son of the Living God . The object of faith is the Passover of Christ .
NCB	Romans	4	18	The Power of Faith . [ g ] Though he hoped against hope , he believed that he would become the father of many nations , in fulfillment of the promise , “ So shall your descendants be. ”
NCB	Romans	4	19	His faith was not shaken when he considered his own body , which was as good as dead ( for he was about one hundred years old ) , and the barren womb of Sarah .
NCB	Romans	4	20	Confident in the promise of God , he did not doubt in unbelief ; rather , he was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God ,
NCB	Romans	4	21	remaining fully convinced that he was able to fulfill his pledge .
NCB	Romans	4	22	Therefore , his faith “ was credited to him as righteousness. ”
NCB	Romans	4	23	“ It was credited to him ” was not written with Abraham alone in mind .
NCB	Romans	4	24	This was also meant for us as well , to whom it will be credited as righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord
NCB	Romans	4	25	who was handed over to death for our sins and who was raised to life for our justification . Footnotes - Romans 4:1 There is but one dispensation , that of grace and faith , which excludes all human pride and allows us to receive everything from God with thanksgiving . The story of Abraham is the purest illustration of this truth . Christian faith is present germinally in the faith of the father of believers ( see Gal 3:6-8 ) . - Romans 4:1 The father of believers can do nothing that is of value before God . He is regarded as just , i.e. , holy and close to God , because he acknowledges that he is poor and entrusts himself wholly to the Lord . To forgive sins constitutes the gratuitous act par excellence , the act of God ( vv . 7-8 ) . - Romans 4:3 At first glance , it seems that the Letter of James ( 2:24 ) goes against this statement of Paul . However , it is clear from the context in James that the phrase “ by works and not by faith alone ” does not mean that genuine faith is not sufficient for justification but rather that faith unaccompanied by works is not genuine . Thus , the teaching of James does not conflict with that of Paul . - Romans 4:6 When a sinner repents , God takes away his unrighteousness by forgiving him when he confesses his sins ( see Ps 32:3-5 ; Ezek 18:23 , 27f ,
NCB	Romans	4	32	; 33:14-16 ) . - Romans 4:9 Abraham became the friend of God ( see Gen 15:6 ) before being circumcised ( see Gen 17:19 ) . This means that circumcision is neither the source of nor the condition for being justified ; it is simply given as a sign of the promise that God made to Abraham because he believed ( Gen
NCB	Romans	5	5	Such hope will not be doomed to disappointment , [ c ] because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us . Reconciliation Already Obtained .
NCB	Romans	5	1	Thes 1:10 ) . - Romans 5:12 The religious history of humanity is here summarized in an incisive synthesis . We should keep our gaze fixed on the luminous heights to which Paul wants to lead us : his vision points to life , grace , and the salvation given in Christ Jesus . The vision is all the more fascinating in that it stands out against the dark background of sin and death . - Romans 5:12 Death : physical death is the penalty for sin as well as the symbol of spiritual death , the ultimate separation of a human being from God . Inasmuch as everyone has sinned : we start life with a sinful nature ( see Gen 8:21 ; Pss 51:7 ; 58:4 ; Eph 2:3 ) . - Romans 5:15 The many : this has the same meaning as “ everyone ” in verse
NCB	Romans	5	2	through whom by faith we have been given access to this grace in which we now live , and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God .
NCB	Romans	5	3	And not only that , but we also glory in our sufferings , because we realize that suffering develops perseverance ,
NCB	Romans	5	4	and perseverance produces character , and character produces hope .
NCB	Romans	5	6	At the appointed time , while we were still helpless , Christ died for the ungodly .
NCB	Romans	5	7	Indeed , it is seldom that anyone will die for a just person , although perhaps for a good person someone might be willing to die .
NCB	Romans	5	8	Thus , God proved his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us .
NCB	Romans	5	9	And so , now that we have been justified by Christ ’ s blood , how much more certainly will we be saved through him from divine retribution . [ d ]
NCB	Romans	5	10	For if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , how much more certain it is that , having been reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
NCB	Romans	5	11	And not only that , but we now even trust exultantly in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have already been granted reconciliation . Adam and Christ—Sin and Grace [ e ]
NCB	Romans	5	12	( see Isa 53:11 ; Mk 10:45 ) . - Romans 5:19 Disobedience is the refusal to acknowledge the primacy of God when it comes to giving life meaning . Obedience is the commitment of one ’ s life to the plan and call of God .
NCB	Romans	5	13	Sin was already in the world before there was any Law , even though sin is not reckoned when there is no Law .
NCB	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless , death reigned over all from Adam to Moses , even over those who had not sinned by disobeying a command , as did Adam who prefigured the one who was to come .
NCB	Romans	5	15	Grace and Life through Christ . However , the gift is not like the transgression . For if the transgression of one man led to the death of the many , [ g ] how much greater was the overflowing effect of the grace of God and the gift of the one man Jesus Christ that has abounded for the many .
NCB	Romans	5	16	The gift of God can not be compared with the sin of the one man . For the one sin resulted in the judgment that brought condemnation , but the gift freely given after many transgressions resulted in justification .
NCB	Romans	5	17	For if , because of one man ’ s transgression , death reigned through that man , how much more shall those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness come to reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ .
NCB	Romans	5	18	Therefore , just as one man ’ s transgression brought condemnation for all , so one man ’ s righteous act resulted in justification and life for all .
NCB	Romans	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one man the many will be made righteous . [ h ]
NCB	Romans	5	20	Purpose of the Law . When the Law was added , offenses multiplied ; but the increase in sins was far exceeded by the increase in grace .
NCB	Romans	5	21	Hence , as sin ’ s reign resulted in death , so the grace of God also might reign through righteousness resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 5:1 Without faith human beings remain in the night of sin . When they have been justified through Christ and believe in the redemption he gives , they enter into a new life , that of salvation . Paul confronts the believer with a living reality . First , he speaks of peace and reconciliation ( Rom 5:1-11 ) ; he must then show how Christ opens for us the way of deliverance from sin ( Rom 5:12-21 ) , from death ( Rom 6:1-23 ) , and from the Law ( Rom 7:1-25 ) ; the song of Christian life is a song of the Spirit and of hope . But Paul can not forget the lot of the Israel that rejects the Gospel ; he enters upon a lengthy discussion and asserts again that the love of God is stronger than any human rejection ( chs . 9–11 ) . - Romans 5:1 We are at peace : some manuscripts and Fathers of the Church give : “ Let us have peace. ” - Romans 5:5 Such hope will not be doomed to disappointment : the hope of believers is more than just an earthly optimism . It is the assurance of our future destiny based on the love of God for us—revealed to us by the Holy Spirit and demonstrated for us by Christ ’ s Death . - Romans 5:9 Saved . . . from divine retribution : the image expresses the tragic situation of humanity without God , that is , without hope and without an authentic future ( see Rom 1:18 ;
NCB	Romans	6	6	We know that our old [ d ] self was crucified with him , so that our sinful body might be destroyed and we might no longer be enslaved to sin .
NCB	Romans	6	1	Cor 5:7-8 ;
NCB	Romans	6	2	Cor 3:14 ) ; the old self and the sinful body signify the human being as marked by sin ( Gal 3:26-29 ) . - Romans 6:8 In the experience of Christ , resurrection followed upon death ; hence , believers who die with Christ are raised to a new quality of moral life . This resurrection is already a fact , and it exerts itself more and more in the life of believers .
NCB	Romans	6	3	Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ?
NCB	Romans	6	4	Through that baptism into his death we were buried with him , so that , just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , [ c ] so we too might begin to live a new life .
NCB	Romans	6	5	For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we shall also be united with him in his resurrection .
NCB	Romans	6	7	For whoever has died has been freed from sin .
NCB	Romans	6	8	However , if we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him . [ e ]
NCB	Romans	6	9	We know that Christ , once raised from the dead , will never die again . Death no longer has power over him .
NCB	Romans	6	10	When he died , he died to sin once and for all . However , the life he lives , he lives for God .
NCB	Romans	6	11	In the same way , you must regard yourselves as being dead to sin and alive for God in Christ Jesus .
NCB	Romans	6	12	Therefore , do not allow sin to reign over your mortal body and make you obey its desires .
NCB	Romans	6	13	Nor should you present any part of your body as an instrument for wickedness leading to sin . Rather , present yourselves to God as having been raised from death to life and the parts of your body to God as instruments for righteousness .
NCB	Romans	6	14	For sin is no longer to have any power over you , since you are not under the Law but under grace .
NCB	Romans	6	15	A Slave of Righteousness . What then ? Should we sin because we are not under the Law but under grace ? Of course not !
NCB	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that if you offer yourself as an obedient slave , you are the slave of the one you obey—either of sin , which leads to death , or of obedience , which leads to righteousness ?
NCB	Romans	6	17	Once you were slaves of sin , but , thanks be to God , you have become obedient in your heart to that pattern of teaching to which you have been delivered .
NCB	Romans	6	18	Now , having been set free from sin , you have become slaves of righteousness .
NCB	Romans	6	19	I am speaking in human terms because you are still weak human beings . For just as you once offered your bodies as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to greater iniquity , so now present them as slaves to righteousness for sanctification .
NCB	Romans	6	20	When you were slaves of sin , you were free from the restraints of righteousness .
NCB	Romans	6	21	But what advantage did you get then from the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death .
NCB	Romans	6	22	However , now that you have been freed from sin and bound to the service of God , the benefit you receive is sanctification , and the end is eternal life .
NCB	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death , but the gift freely given by God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 6:1 Salvation is grace that transcends sin and the power of human beings or even of the Law . This passage urges us to reflect on the meaning of Baptism in the life of a Christian . - Romans 6:1 In the History of Salvation , there is a unique event : the Death and Resurrection of Jesus ; it is the departure for a new life . Through Baptism , the believer enters into this experience of Christ and shares its power . Baptism inaugurates a newness of life that will be brought to completion in the future . - Romans 6:4 Glory of the Father : God who reveals his power and holiness . - Romans 6:6 The adjective old has a precise meaning for Paul : it describes the reality of a sinful world that is closed against the new life that has its source in Christ ( see
NCB	Romans	7	7	What then should we say ? That the Law is sinful ? Absolutely not ! Yet if it had not been for the Law , I would not have known what sin was . I would not have known what covet is if the Law had not said , “ You shall not covet. ”
NCB	Romans	7	1	Are you aware , brethren ( for I am certain that you are people who have knowledge of the Law ) , that a person is bound by the Law only during that person ’ s lifetime ?
NCB	Romans	7	2	For example , a woman is bound by the Law to her husband as long as he lives , but if her husband dies , she is released from her husband in regard to the Law .
NCB	Romans	7	3	Therefore , she will be judged to be an adulteress if she has relations with another man while her husband is still alive . However , if her husband dies , she is free from that provision of the Law , and if she then has relations with another man , she is not an adulteress .
NCB	Romans	7	4	In the same way , brethren , through the body of Christ you have died to the Law and have been set free to belong to another , that is , to the one who rose from the dead in order that we might bear fruit for God .
NCB	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , our sinful passions were aroused by the Law and at work in our bodies , and they bore fruit for death .
NCB	Romans	7	6	But now , we are released from the Law , having died to that which held us captive , so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit in contrast to the old written code . [ c ] The Function of the Law . [ d ]
NCB	Romans	7	8	But sin seized the opportunity offered by the commandment and produced in me all kinds of covetousness . Apart from the Law , sin is dead .
NCB	Romans	7	9	I lived apart from the Law , but when the commandment came , sin came to life ,
NCB	Romans	7	10	and I died . The commandment that was for life proved to be death for me .
NCB	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing an opportunity offered by the commandment , deceived me , [ e ] and through it killed me .
NCB	Romans	7	12	And so the Law is holy , and the commandment is holy and just and good .
NCB	Romans	7	13	Did what is good , then , cause my death ? By no means ! But in order that sin might be recognized as such , it brought about my death through what is good , and therefore through the commandment sin became completely sinful .
NCB	Romans	7	14	Sin and Death . We clearly understand that the Law is spiritual , but I am unspiritual , sold into slavery to sin .
NCB	Romans	7	15	I do not understand my own actions . For I do not do what I want ; rather , I do what I hate .
NCB	Romans	7	16	Now if I do what I do not want , then I agree that the Law is good . [ f ]
NCB	Romans	7	17	This indicates that it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells in me .
NCB	Romans	7	18	For I know that nothing good dwells in me , that is , in my flesh . I have the desire to do what is good , but I can not do what is good .
NCB	Romans	7	19	For I do not do the good I desire ; rather , it is the evil I do not desire that I end up doing .
NCB	Romans	7	20	Now if I do what I do not desire , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells in me .
NCB	Romans	7	21	I have thus discovered this principle : when I want to do what is good , evil lies close at hand .
NCB	Romans	7	22	In my innermost self , I delight in the Law of God ,
NCB	Romans	7	23	but I perceive in the members of my body another law at war with the Law that I cherish in my mind . Thus , I am made captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members .
NCB	Romans	7	24	What a wretched man I am ! Who will rescue me from this body destined for death ?
NCB	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord . So then , with my mind I am a slave to the Law of God , but with my flesh to the law of sin . Footnotes - Romans 7:1 Human alienation finds expression in three main forms : sin , death , and law . Salvation delivers human beings from this threefold enslavement . The law here is , of course , the Law of Moses , but it is also the command given by God to the first couple and , in the last analysis , every law that is imposed from outside . - Romans 7:1 Christians have been freed from the Law . This is a way of saying that a new regime , that of the Spirit , henceforth energizes their life . - Romans 7:6 Written code or “ letter ” is here the written Law of Moses . - Romans 7:7 Christ was put to death because he affirmed the priority of the spirit over legalism . In fact , it is sin that falsifies the human condition . Without having the power to neutralize it , the Law unmasks it and then buries human beings under the weight of guilt ( see Gal 3:10-14 , 19-22 ) . - Romans 7:11 Deceived me : an allusion to the temptation by the serpent in Gen 3:13 . - Romans 7:16 I agree that the Law is good : the Holy Spirit reveals to Paul the essential goodness of the Law even when Paul is inclined to rebel against it and disobey it .
NCB	Romans	8	8	Those who live according to the flesh can never be pleasing to God .
NCB	Romans	8	1	) Christ died for us ; (
NCB	Romans	8	2	) Christ is alive and seated at God ’ s right hand , a position of awesome power ; and (
NCB	Romans	8	3	) Christ himself makes intercession for us . - Romans 8:39 In the terms angels . . . principalities . . . height . . . depth Paul is perhaps speaking of spiritual entities that were considered to be intermediaries between God and humanity .
NCB	Romans	8	4	) the will of God , whose love embraces believers in order to associate them with the risen and glorified Christ , so that they may be in the image of his Son , who is himself the perfect image of the Father ( see Col 1:15 ) ( vv . 28-30 ) . - Romans 8:28 We know that God makes all things work together for good for those who love him : some manuscripts have : “ We know that all things work together for good to those who love God. ” - Romans 8:34 The reasons why no one can condemn us who are God ’ s elect are three : (
NCB	Romans	8	5	Those who live according to the flesh fix their attention on the things of the flesh , while those who live according to the Spirit set their thoughts on spiritual things .
NCB	Romans	8	6	The desires of the flesh result in death , but the desires of the Spirit result in life and peace .
NCB	Romans	8	7	Indeed , the desires of the flesh will be hostile to God , for they do not submit to the Law of God , nor could they do so .
NCB	Romans	8	9	You , however , do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit , since the Spirit of God dwells in you . Anyone who does not possess the Spirit of Christ can not belong to him .
NCB	Romans	8	10	But if Christ is in you , then even though the body is dead as a result of sin , the Spirit is alive in you because of righteousness .
NCB	Romans	8	11	If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , then the one who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you . [ d ]
NCB	Romans	8	12	Consequently , brethren , we are not debtors to the flesh and obliged to live according to the flesh .
NCB	Romans	8	13	If you do live according to the flesh , you will die . However , if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live .
NCB	Romans	8	14	[ e ] Those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God .
NCB	Romans	8	15	For you did not receive a spirit of slavery leading to fear ; rather , you received the Spirit of adoption , enabling us to cry out , “ Abba ! Father ! ”
NCB	Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself bears witness with our Spirit that we are children of God .
NCB	Romans	8	17	And if we are children , then we are heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ , provided that we share his sufferings so that we may also share his glory .
NCB	Romans	8	18	The Future Glory That Shall Be Revealed . [ f ] I consider that the sufferings we presently endure are not worth comparing with the glory to be revealed in us .
NCB	Romans	8	19	Indeed , creation itself eagerly awaits the revelation of the children of God .
NCB	Romans	8	20	For creation was subjected to frustration , not of its own choice but by the will of the one who subjected it , in the hope
NCB	Romans	8	21	that creation itself will be freed from its slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God .
NCB	Romans	8	22	) . Paul beautifully sketches the proofs of this movement that is nearing its fulfillment : (
NCB	Romans	8	23	;
NCB	Romans	8	24	For in hope we were saved . Now to see something does not involve hope . For why should we hope for what we have already seen ?
NCB	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not yet see , then we wait for it with patience .
NCB	Romans	8	26	In the same way , even the Spirit helps us in our weakness . For we do not know how to pray as we should , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs that can not be put into words .
NCB	Romans	8	27	And the one who searches hearts knows the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God ’ s will .
NCB	Romans	8	28	We know that God makes all things work together for good for those who love him [ g ] and who are called according to his purpose .
NCB	Romans	8	29	For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son so that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
NCB	Romans	8	30	Those whom he predestined he also called , and those whom he called he also justified , and those whom he justified he also glorified .
NCB	Romans	8	31	Who Can Separate Us from the Love of Christ ? What then can we say in response to all this ? If God is for us , who can be against us ?
NCB	Romans	8	32	He did not spare his own Son but gave him up for all of us . How then can he fail also to give us everything else along with him ?
NCB	Romans	8	33	Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen ? It is God who acquits .
NCB	Romans	8	34	Who will condemn ? Christ Jesus , who died , or rather rose again , who is at God ’ s right hand and intercedes for us ? [ h ]
NCB	Romans	8	35	Who then can separate us from the love of Christ ? Will hardship , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or the sword ?
NCB	Romans	8	36	As it is written , “ For your sake we are being slain all day long ; we are treated like sheep to be slaughtered. ”
NCB	Romans	8	37	No , throughout all these things we are conquerors because of him who loved us .
NCB	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor present things , nor things to come , nor powers ,
NCB	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , [ i ] nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - Romans 8:1 In the experience of the love of God there are three dominant elements : the life of the Spirit ( vv . 5-13 ) , the sure realization of being children of God ( vv . 14-17 ) , and the certainty of future glory ( vv . 18-30 ) . This ascending description ends with a triumphant hymn to the unfailing love of the Lord ( vv . 31-39 ) . - Romans 8:4 Righteous requirements of the Law : although the Law is not a means of salvation , it still plays a role in the life of a believer as a moral guide , obeyed out of love for God and by the power of the Holy Spirit . This marks the fulfillment of Jeremiah ’ s prophecy of the New Covenant ( Jer 31:33ff ) . - Romans 8:5 What is the Christian life in its deepest reality ? Paul thinks of all that the Holy Spirit inaugurates in the existence of the believer . He is the Spirit of the Father and of Christ , dwells in every Christian , and is a source of spiritual life for each . We can look upon him as the soul of the Church . He is the power of a progressive transformation , which culminates in the resurrection of the body . In a privileged moment—that of prayer—believers grasp their new state as children of God . Thus , believers escape from the flesh , i.e. , an orientation to and a realization of a life without future and without accomplishment ( see Gal 5:16-25 ) . - Romans 8:11 For the connection between the Resurrection of Christ and that of believers , see
NCB	Romans	9	9	For this is how the promise was worded : “ About this time next year I shall return , and Sarah will have a son. ”

NCB	Romans	9	6	It is not as though the word of God has proved false . For not all who were Israelites truly belong to Israel ,

NCB	Romans	9	8	In other words , it is not through physical descent that people are regarded as children of God . Rather , the children of the promise are those who are counted as descendants .

NCB	Romans	9	13	As it is written , “ I loved Jacob , but Esau I hated. ” [ d ]
NCB	Romans	9	14	Has God Been Unjust ? [ e ] What then are we to say to that ? Has God been unjust ? Of course not !
NCB	Romans	9	15	For he says to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy , and I will have pity on whomever I will have pity. ”
NCB	Romans	9	16	; Isa 9:6f ; Jer 23:5 ; 31:31-34 ; Ezek 34:23f ; 37:24-28 ) . - Romans 9:5 Came the Christ , God forever , who is over all : another possible translation is : “ came the Christ . God who is over all be praised. ” - Romans 9:13 Hated : in the Biblical sense of the word , that is , “ I preferred Jacob. ” - Romans 9:14 Paul thinks with astonishment of the unforeseeable calls of God , who chooses individuals and people from the midst of a sinful world . The image of the potter signifies in the Bible the sovereign freedom of God that defies all expectations . The texts from Hosea ( 2:25 and 11:10 ) spoke of the conversion of Israel ; Paul interprets them as proclamations of an unprecedented initiative of God : the call of the Gentiles . - Romans 9:22 Objects of his wrath : human beings who by sinning incur God ’ s anger . - Romans 9:33 This verse uses a combination of two texts from Isaiah that was apparently in common use by the early Christians to defend Christ ’ s Messiahship ( see
NCB	Romans	9	17	For Scripture says to Pharaoh , “ I have raised you up so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed throughout the earth. ”
NCB	Romans	9	18	Consequently , he shows mercy to whomever he wills , and he hardens the hearts of whomever he wills .
NCB	Romans	9	19	In response , you will say to me , “ Why then does he still find fault ? Who can resist his will ? ”
NCB	Romans	9	20	But who indeed are you , a human being , to argue with God ? Can something that is made say to its maker , “ Why did you make me like this ? ”
NCB	Romans	9	21	Surely , the potter can mold the clay as he wishes . Does he not have the right to make out of the same lump of clay one vessel for a noble purpose and another for ordinary use ?
NCB	Romans	9	22	What if God , although wishing to show his wrath and to make known his power , nevertheless with great patience endured the objects of his wrath [ f ] destined for destruction ?

NCB	Romans	9	24	We are the ones whom he has called not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles .
NCB	Romans	9	25	Witness of the Old Testament . As indeed he says in Hosea , “ Those who were not my people I will call ‘ my people , ’ and her who was not beloved I will call ‘ beloved. ’
NCB	Romans	9	26	And in the very place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they shall be called children of the living God. ”
NCB	Romans	9	27	And Isaiah cries out in regard to Israel : “ Though the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea , only a remnant of them will be saved .
NCB	Romans	9	28	For the sentence of the Lord on the earth will be executed quickly and with finality. ”
NCB	Romans	9	29	Isaiah had foretold previously : “ If the Lord of hosts had not left us any descendants , we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah. ”
NCB	Romans	9	30	A Misguided Zeal . What then shall we say ? That the Gentiles who did not strive for righteousness have achieved it , that is , righteousness based on faith ,
NCB	Romans	9	31	but that Israel , who did strive for righteousness based on the Law , did not succeed in attaining it ?
NCB	Romans	9	32	Why did this happen ? Because they did not pursue it by faith but on the basis of works . They tripped over the stone that causes one to stumble ,
NCB	Romans	9	33	as it is written : “ Behold , I am laying in Zion a stone that will make people stumble and a rock that will cause them to fall . But the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame. ” [ g ] Footnotes - Romans 9:1 Paul was born a Jew . In his eyes , Christianity was the historical fulfillment of the destiny and hope of Israel , the authentic conclusion of the Old Covenant , which was destined to shine out brightly in the New Covenant that was inaugurated by the Passover of Christ . But reality confronts him with agonizing problems . It had been necessary to make Jewish Christians understand that the salvation given by Jesus Christ caused a break from the Jewish religious system ( see
NCB	Romans	10	10	For one believes in the heart and so is justified , and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved .
NCB	Romans	10	1	Brethren , my heart ’ s desire and my prayer to God for them is that they may be saved .
NCB	Romans	10	2	I can testify to the zeal that they have for God , but it is not based on knowledge .
NCB	Romans	10	3	For , being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God , and thereby seeking to establish their own , they have not submitted themselves to God ’ s righteousness .
NCB	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the fulfillment of the Law for the justification of all who believe . The Word Is Near You . [ a ]
NCB	Romans	10	5	Concerning the righteousness that comes from the Law , Moses writes , “ The person who does these things will attain life by them. ”
NCB	Romans	10	6	However , the righteousness that comes from faith says , “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will go up to heaven ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ down ) ,
NCB	Romans	10	7	or ‘ Who will descend into the abyss ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) . ” [ b ]
NCB	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , on your lips and in your heart ” ( that is , the word of faith that we proclaim ) .
NCB	Romans	10	9	If you confess with your lips , “ Jesus is Lord , ” [ c ] and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
NCB	Romans	10	11	As Scripture asserts , “ No one who believes in him will be put to shame. ”
NCB	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile . The same Lord is Lord of all , and his generosity is manifested to all who call upon him .
NCB	Romans	10	13	Indeed , “ everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. ”
NCB	Romans	10	14	Not All Have Responded to the Good News . But how can they call on him if they have not come to believe in him ? And how can they believe in someone about whom they have never heard ? And how can they hear without someone to preach to them ?
NCB	Romans	10	15	And how will there be people to preach if they are not sent ? As it is written , “ How beautiful are the feet of those who proclaim the good news ! ”
NCB	Romans	10	16	However , not all have accepted the good news . As Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? ”
NCB	Romans	10	17	So then , faith comes from what is heard , and what is heard comes through the word of Christ .
NCB	Romans	10	18	And so I ask : Have they not heard ? Indeed , they have : “ Their voice has gone out all over the world , and their words to the ends of the earth. ”
NCB	Romans	10	19	Well then , I ask : Is it possible that Israel failed to understand ? First Moses says : “ I will make you envious of those who are not a nation . I will rouse your anger against a foolish nation. ”
NCB	Romans	10	20	And Isaiah boldly states : “ I was found by those who were not looking for me . I have revealed myself to those who never asked for me. ”
NCB	Romans	10	21	But regarding Israel , he says : “ All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and rebellious people. ” Footnotes - Romans 10:5 In Jesus God has placed himself at our disposal ; we need only acknowledge the risen Christ . This is one of the earliest formulas with which candidates for Baptism professed their faith . - Romans 10:7 Paul here combines Deut 30:13 and Ps 107:26 . - Romans 10:9 Jesus is Lord : the word “ Lord ” occurs some 6,000 times in the Septuagint ( the Greek translation of the Old Testament ) for “ Yahweh , ” the name of the God of Israel . Here it is applied to Jesus by an early baptismal profession of faith to indicate Christ ’ s divinity .
NCB	Romans	11	11	A Providential Misstep . [ b ] And so I ask : Have they stumbled so that they might fall ? By no means ! However , through their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles , and this has stirred them to envy .
NCB	Romans	11	1	I ask , then : Has God rejected his people ? Of course not ! I too am an Israelite , a descendant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
NCB	Romans	11	2	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew . You surely must know what Scripture asserts in the passage about Elijah where he pleads with God against Israel :
NCB	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , they have killed your Prophets , they have torn down your altars . I alone am left , and they are seeking my life. ”
NCB	Romans	11	4	What was God ’ s response to him ? “ I have spared for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt before Baal. ”
NCB	Romans	11	5	So too , at the present time , there is a remnant , chosen by grace .
NCB	Romans	11	6	But if it is by grace , then it is no longer by works ; otherwise grace would no longer be grace .
NCB	Romans	11	7	What follows , then ? Israel was unable to attain what it was seeking . The elect attained it , but the rest were hardened ,
NCB	Romans	11	8	as it is written : “ God gave them a spirit of lethargy : eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear , down to this very day. ”
NCB	Romans	11	9	And David says : “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them .
NCB	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened so that they can not see , and their backs be bent forever. ”
NCB	Romans	11	12	Now if their transgression results in riches for the world , and their loss results in riches for the Gentiles , how much greater riches will their full participation bring !
NCB	Romans	11	13	Now I am addressing you Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am the apostle to the Gentiles , I glory in my ministry
NCB	Romans	11	14	in the hope that it will arouse the jealousy of those who are of my flesh so that some might be saved .
NCB	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection leads to the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
NCB	Romans	11	16	The Gentiles ’ Salvation . [ c ] If the firstfruits are holy , then so is the whole lump of dough . And if the root is holy , so are the branches .
NCB	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you , a wild olive shoot , have been grafted in their place to share in the rich root of the olive tree ,
NCB	Romans	11	18	do not boast over against the branches ! If you start to boast , remember that it is not you who support the root but the root that supports you .
NCB	Romans	11	19	You will assert , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
NCB	Romans	11	20	That is true . They were broken off because of their unbelief , but you hold your place only because of your faith . Therefore , do not rise up in pride but be filled with awe .
NCB	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches , he might not spare you either .
NCB	Romans	11	22	Therefore , keep in mind the kindness and the severity of God : his severity toward those who fell , but his kindness to you provided that you remain deserving of that kindness . Otherwise , you also will be cut off ,
NCB	Romans	11	23	while those who do not persist in their unbelief will be grafted in , since God has the power to do so again .
NCB	Romans	11	24	For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated one , how much more easily will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree .
NCB	Romans	11	25	All Israel Will Be Saved . [ d ] I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery , brethren , lest you think yourselves too wise : this hardening that has afflicted Israel will continue only until the full number of the Gentiles has come in .
NCB	Romans	11	26	This is how all Israel will be saved , as it is written , “ The Deliverer will come out of Zion ; he will banish godlessness from Jacob
NCB	Romans	11	27	And this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins. ”
NCB	Romans	11	28	As far as the gospel is concerned , they are enemies for your sake . However , as regards election , they are beloved for the sake of the patriarchs .
NCB	Romans	11	29	For the gifts of God and his calling are irrevocable .
NCB	Romans	11	30	Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience ,
NCB	Romans	11	31	so they too have now become disobedient in order that , through the mercy shown to you , they too may receive mercy .
NCB	Romans	11	32	For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may show mercy to all .
NCB	Romans	11	33	The Judgments of God Are Unfathomable . [ e ] Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unfathomable his ways !

Footnotes - Romans 11:1 The threat to “ harden ” human beings ( Isa 29:10 ) is often cited in the New Testament in censuring seemingly irremediable human blindness ( see Mt 13:14 ; Jn 12:40 ; Acts 28:26 ) . God is not indifferent to human rejection . - Romans 11:11 Everything works together to carry out God ’ s plan , which is to save all human beings . The Gospel , poorly accepted by a large part of Israel , has now been announced to the Gentile world . This fact should stir up the envy of the Israelites and make them take more careful notice of Christ . Paul hopes for their conversion and already foresees it as a passage from death to life , like the great resurrection of the people about which Ezekiel speaks in ch .
NCB	Romans	11	37	. - Romans 11:16 As for the Gentile converts who may be tempted to look down on their Jewish brothers , the Apostle recalls their own spiritual origins : the Church was born from the Jewish people ; she is the fulfillment of the Remnant of Israel . The Gentiles were grafted like a wild olive shoot onto this olive tree . Each one of them must remember that God has called them out of love and mercy . Even in their rejection of Jesus , the Jews do not lose their quality of belonging to the chosen people . The lesson is always valid : no one can boast about being saved . Anti-Semitism can be nothing but a scandal in the Christian world : “ We are spiritual Semites ” ( Pope Pius XI ) . The originality of the Church of Jesus consists in bringing about the unity of humankind , and first of all of the two opposed groups that are the Jews and the Gentiles ( Eph 2:14-16 ) . - Romans 11:25 Prolonging the vision of the Prophets , Paul declares that the chosen people have not been definitively rejected ; God does not go back on his choice . The coming of salvation remains open to the People of the Promise . The fate of Israel is not closed off from the salvation that it contributes to bring about for the profit of the Gentiles . In spite of detours of an often tragic history , the Lord continues to guide his people toward a glorious destiny in order to show that he saves his people because he loves them . The entry of the Gentiles can not signify the exclusion of Israel ; God ’ s mercy is for all . - Romans 11:33 Having arrived at this summit where all humankind is reunited in the salvation of God , Paul can not refrain from crying out in adoration and admiration . - Romans 11:34 This citation is from the Septuagint of Isa 40:13 . - Romans 11:35 This citation is from an old Greek version of Job 41:3a and does not coincide with the Hebrew text of Job 41:11a .

NCB	Romans	12	1	Cor 12:12-27 . - Romans 12:20 Burning coals : this means that the responsibility of the other is increased , or else that he is given a stimulus to repentance . In any case , the doing of good must not depend on its acknowledgment by the other .
NCB	Romans	12	2	Do not be conformed to the world , but be transformed by the renewal of your minds , so that you will be able to discern the will of God and to know what is good and acceptable and perfect . Right Use of the Gifts of the One Body .
NCB	Romans	12	3	Through the grace that God has bestowed upon me , I advise every one of you not to think of yourself too highly , but to regard yourself objectively , based on the measure of faith that God has granted .
NCB	Romans	12	4	For just as in one body we have many parts , and the parts do not all have the same function ,
NCB	Romans	12	5	so we , though many , make up one body in Christ , [ b ] and individually we are all parts of one another .
NCB	Romans	12	6	We all have different gifts according to the grace given to us . If it is a gift of prophecy , we should exercise it in proportion to our faith .
NCB	Romans	12	7	If it is a gift of ministry , we should engage in serving others . If it is a gift of teaching , we should teach .
NCB	Romans	12	8	If it is a gift of exhortation , we should encourage . Whoever gives alms should do so generously ; whoever leads should do so conscientiously ; whoever performs acts of mercy should do so cheerfully . A Truly Sincere Love .
NCB	Romans	12	9	Let your love be sincere . Loathe what is evil and hold fast to what is good .
NCB	Romans	12	10	Love one another with genuine affection . Esteem others more highly than yourself .
NCB	Romans	12	11	Do not be lacking in zeal , but serve the Lord with spiritual fervor .
NCB	Romans	12	13	Contribute to the needs of the saints , and practice hospitality .
NCB	Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you ; bless them and do not curse them .
NCB	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice ; weep with those who weep .
NCB	Romans	12	16	Live in harmony with one another . Do not consider yourself to be better than others , but associate with the lowly , and never be conceited .
NCB	Romans	12	17	Do not repay anyone evil for evil . Rather , be concerned about doing what is good in the eyes of all .
NCB	Romans	12	18	As much as possible , and to the extent of your ability , live in peace with everyone .
NCB	Romans	12	19	Dearly beloved , never seek revenge . Leave that to the time of retribution . For it is written , “ Vengeance is mine , says the Lord . I will repay. ”
NCB	Romans	12	20	On the contrary , “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him something to drink . By doing this , you will heap burning coals [ c ] on his head. ”
NCB	Romans	12	21	Do not be conquered by evil , but conquer evil with good . Footnotes - Romans 12:1 Following his custom , Paul ends his Letter ( before the Epilogue ) with a number of ideas and counsels for Christian life in the midst of everyday reality . - Romans 12:5 One body in Christ : see
NCB	Romans	13	13	Let us behave honorably as in the day : not in orgies and drunkenness , not in debauchery and licentiousness , not in quarreling and jealousy .
NCB	Romans	13	1	Let everyone submit himself to the governing authorities , for there is no authority except that which derives from God , and whatever authorities exist have been instituted by God .
NCB	Romans	13	2	Consequently , anyone who resists authority is rebelling against what God has appointed , and those who so resist will bring judgment upon themselves .
NCB	Romans	13	3	Rulers are a source of fear not to those who do good but rather to those who do evil . Do you wish to be free of fear from someone in authority ? Then continue to do what is right and you will receive his approval .
NCB	Romans	13	4	For he is acting as God ’ s representative for your welfare . But if you do what is evil , then be afraid for he does not wear a sword for nothing . People in authority are God ’ s servants to mete out punishment to wrongdoers .
NCB	Romans	13	5	Therefore , you are obliged to submit , not only because of fear of punishment but also because of conscience .
NCB	Romans	13	6	That is why you also pay taxes , for the authorities are God ’ s servants , and they devote themselves to this service .
NCB	Romans	13	7	Pay to each person what is rightfully his—taxes to the one to whom taxes are due , tolls to the one to whom tolls are due , respect to the one to whom respect is due , honor to the one to whom honor is due . Love Is the Fulfillment of the Law . [ b ]
NCB	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone except the debt of love you owe one another . The one who loves others has fulfilled the Law .
NCB	Romans	13	9	“ You shall not commit adultery , You shall not kill , You shall not steal , You shall not covet , ” and every other commandment are all summed up in this : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NCB	Romans	13	10	Love can not result in any harm to the neighbor ; therefore , love is the fulfillment of the Law .
NCB	Romans	13	11	Live Honestly As in the Light . [ c ] Do this knowing that the hour has come . It is time for you to awaken from sleep . For our salvation is nearer to us now than it was when we first began to believe .
NCB	Romans	13	12	The night is nearly over , and the day is at hand . Let us therefore cast aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light .
NCB	Romans	13	14	Rather , put on the Lord Jesus Christ and allow no opportunity for the flesh to gratify its sinful desires . Footnotes - Romans 13:1 Christians do not keep themselves apart from the city in which they live and normally carry out their duties in the civic community . Society is willed by God as an organized entity . Authority comes from God and is supposed to serve the common good . Paul here gives a practical rule of conduct for Christians . In the face of power , Christians choose neither disinterest nor subversion . - Romans 13:8 The fact that love fulfills the whole Law is an essential tenet of Christianity , and Paul shows how it is true in the concrete . - Romans 13:11 Paul does not say that the end time is near . Rather he affirms that those who have been baptized , and delivered from the grasp of evil , of Satan , who is the prince of darkness ( Col 1:13 ) , live in a new era . This new state also requires a new way of conduct . As Paul contrasted flesh and spirit , now he contrasts light and darkness—an image that is current to his epoch and self-explanatory . To put on Jesus Christ is to act in accord with the Holy Spirit and his inspirations—in short , to carry out the very meaning of Baptism .
NCB	Romans	14	14	I know , and am convinced in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean in itself . However , it is unclean for someone who believes it to be unclean .
NCB	Romans	14	1	Cor 8:4-13 ) . Paul has always been categorically opposed to confusing grace with the Law ; he has refused to impose either Jewish or Gentile practices on new converts and has declared that all ancient religious practices are excluded as a way to gain justification . He is undoubtedly also aware of the teaching of Jesus concerning what is clean and unclean ( Mk 7:1-23 ) . Moreover , he has never refused to allow Christians of Jewish origin to esteem attachment to their religious tradition . He has put clamps on the new freedom only when such freedom turns into provocative pretense and an attitude of superiority . Freedom is not given to enable someone to criticize others ; it does not consist in remonstrating with others about theory or comportment . No principle of freedom can lead to an attitude of scorn or incomprehension . Christians maintain a desire for the salvation of all , and regard everyone as a brother or sister for whom Christ died . They are open to safeguard the relations and exchanges of a varied and pluralist community . Profound respect for the conscience of each person is required , as is the refusal to judge one another . Most important , all must have the freedom to act according to their consciences before God ( see Acts
NCB	Romans	14	2	One person may have the faith to eat any kind of food , whereas a weak person may eat only vegetables .
NCB	Romans	14	3	The one who eats everything must not look contemptuously on the one who does not , and the one who abstains must not pass judgment on the one who eats , for God has welcomed both .
NCB	Romans	14	4	What right do you have to pass judgment on someone else ’ s servant ? The master will determine whether that servant will stand or fall . But the servant will be upheld , for the Lord has the power to enable him to stand .
NCB	Romans	14	5	One person may consider one day to be more sacred than another , while another may judge all days to be alike . Let everyone be convinced in his own beliefs .
NCB	Romans	14	6	Whoever observes the day observes it for the Lord . Also , the one who eats , eats in honor of the Lord , since he gives thanks to God , while the one who abstains , abstains in honor of the Lord and thereby also gives thanks to God .
NCB	Romans	14	7	None of us lives for himself , and none of us dies for himself .
NCB	Romans	14	8	If we live , we live for the Lord , and if we die , we die for the Lord . Therefore , whether we live or die , we are the Lord ’ s .
NCB	Romans	14	9	It was for this reason that Christ died and came to life again : so that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living .
NCB	Romans	14	10	Why then do you pass judgment on your brother ? Or why do you despise your brother ? All of us will have to stand before the judgment seat of God .
NCB	Romans	14	11	For it is written , “ As I live , says the Lord , every knee shall bow before me , and every tongue shall give praise to God. ”
NCB	Romans	14	12	Consideration for the Weak Conscience . So , then , each one of us will have to give an account of himself to God .
NCB	Romans	14	13	Therefore , let us cease passing judgment on one another , but rather judge never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother .

NCB	Romans	14	16	Do not let what you think is good to become what others say is evil .
NCB	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of food and drink but of righteousness , peace , and joy in the Holy Spirit .
NCB	Romans	14	18	The one who serves Christ in such things is pleasing to God and respected by others .
NCB	Romans	14	19	Let us [ b ] then pursue the ways that lead to peace and mutual edification .
NCB	Romans	14	20	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food . All food is indeed clean , but it is wrong for you to cause others to fall by what you eat .
NCB	Romans	14	21	It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that causes your brother to stumble .
NCB	Romans	14	22	Whatever faith you have , keep it between yourself and God . Blessed is the one who has no reason to condemn himself because of what he approves .
NCB	Romans	14	23	But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats , because he does not act from faith . Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin . Footnotes - Romans 14:1 Two groups or tendencies are already manifested in the early Christian communities . Some cling , though not without some scruples , to the religious practices in which they have been reared : refusal of sacrificed meats or abstentions from foods on certain days—and these may be termed “ the weak. ” Others , in the same freedom of the Gospel , criticize the former—and these may be termed “ the strong. ” The text evokes a situation like that in Corinth (

NCB	Romans	15	3	Even Christ never sought to please himself , but , as it is written , “ The insults of those who insult you have fallen upon me. ”
NCB	Romans	15	4	For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction , so that by perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures , we may continue to have hope .
NCB	Romans	15	5	May the God of perseverance and encouragement grant that you may live in harmony with one another , following in the example of Jesus Christ ,
NCB	Romans	15	6	so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . God ’ s Fidelity and Mercy . [ a ]
NCB	Romans	15	7	Therefore , accept one another for the glory of God , just as Christ has accepted you .
NCB	Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ became a servant of the circumcised to manifest God ’ s truthfulness by confirming the promises given to the patriarchs
NCB	Romans	15	9	and so that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy , as it is written : “ Therefore , I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing praises to your name. ”
NCB	Romans	15	10	And again it says : “ Rejoice , O Gentiles , with his people. ” [ b ]
NCB	Romans	15	11	Further it adds : “ Praise the Lord , all you Gentiles , and let all the peoples praise him. ”

NCB	Romans	15	16	He has appointed me to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God , in order that the Gentiles might become an acceptable offering consecrated by the Holy Spirit .
NCB	Romans	15	17	In Christ Jesus , then , I have reason to glory in my service of God .
NCB	Romans	15	18	I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to lead the Gentiles to obedience to God by word and deed ,
NCB	Romans	15	19	by the power of signs and wonders , through the power of the Spirit of God . So from Jerusalem [ f ] and the surrounding area , even as far as Illyricum , I have completed the preaching of the gospel of Christ .
NCB	Romans	15	20	Moreover , I have always striven to preach the gospel of Christ where the name of Christ is not known , not wanting to build on someone else ’ s foundation .

NCB	Romans	15	22	Paul ’ s Plans for Traveling—Even to Spain . [ g ] That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you .
NCB	Romans	15	23	But now , since there is nothing more to keep me in these regions , and since for a good many years I have desired to visit you ,
NCB	Romans	15	24	I hope to see you when I am on my way to Spain . Then , after I have enjoyed your company for a while , you can send me on my way there .
NCB	Romans	15	25	Presently , however , I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints .
NCB	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia [ h ] have resolved to make a contribution for the benefit of the poor among the saints in Jerusalem .
NCB	Romans	15	27	They were pleased to do so , and indeed they are indebted to them , for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings , they owe it to them to share their material blessings with them .
NCB	Romans	15	28	Therefore , when I have completed this task and have delivered the fruit of their generosity to them , I will set out for Spain and visit you along the way .
NCB	Romans	15	29	And I am sure that when I come , I shall do so with the full measure of the blessing of Christ .
NCB	Romans	15	30	Therefore , I exhort you , brethren , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join me in my labors by praying to God for me
NCB	Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there .
NCB	Romans	15	32	In that way , I can come to you in joy , if God so wills , and be refreshed together with you .
NCB	Romans	15	33	The God of peace be with you all . Amen . Footnotes - Romans 15:7 It is the unity of believers that glorifies God ( Rom 15:6 ) . That is why , despite the fact that Christ himself preached only to the Jews—to the circumcised—he willed that the Gentiles should also be called to salvation and thereby attest that they too are loved by God . In that same love , all Christians should embrace their neighbors . - Romans 15:10 The citation from Deut 32:43 is given in the Septuagint version . - Romans 15:12 The citation is based on Isa 11:10 and Rev 5:5 ; 22:16 .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	4	My message and my proclamation were not made with persuasive words of wisdom , but in a demonstration of the Spirit and of power , [ b ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	5	so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God . The Mysterious Wisdom of God The Plan of God , True Wisdom .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	6	However , to those who are mature , we do speak of wisdom , although not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age [ c ] whose end is not far distant .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	7	Rather , we speak of the mysterious and hidden wisdom of God , which God decreed before the ages for our glory .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	8	None of the rulers of this age comprehended it . If they had , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory . [ d ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	9	For as it is written , “ Eye has not seen , ear has not heard , nor has the human heart imagined what God has prepared for those who love him. ”
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	10	The Spirit Enables Faith To Mature . However , God has revealed these things to us through the Spirit . For the Spirit explores everything , even the depths of God .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	11	And just as no human being comprehends any person ’ s innermost being except the person ’ s own spirit within him , so also no one comprehends what pertains to God except the Spirit of God .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	12	We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may understand the gifts bestowed upon us by God .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	13	And we speak of these things in words taught to us not by human wisdom but by the Spirit , expressing spiritual things in spiritual words . [ e ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	14	An unspiritual person refuses to accept what pertains to the Spirit of God , for to him such things are foolish . He is unable to understand them because they can be discerned only in a spiritual way .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	2	15	A spiritual person [ f ] discerns all things , and he is himself subject to no one else ’ s judgment :

NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	3	for you are still of the flesh . As long as jealousy and rivalry continue among you , are you not of the flesh and acting as mere mortals ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I fed you with milk , rather than with solid food that you were not ready to digest . Indeed , even now you are still not ready to receive it ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	4	Whenever someone says , “ I belong to Paul , ” and another asserts , “ I belong to Apollos , ” are you not acting in a merely human fashion ? Missionaries and Servants of Christ [ a ] God ’ s Coworkers .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	5	What then is Apollos ? What is Paul ? We are only servants through whom you have come to believe , as the Lord assigned each to accomplish .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I planted the seed , and Apollos watered it , but God caused it to grow .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	7	Therefore , neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is of any importance but only God who causes the growth .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	8	The one who plants and the one who waters have a common end , and each will be rewarded in accordance with his labor .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are God ’ s coworkers ; you are God ’ s field , God ’ s building .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	10	By the grace that God has given to me , I laid a foundation like a skilled master builder , and someone else is building on that foundation . But each one must be careful how he builds on it .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For no one can lay any foundation other than the one that has already been laid , namely , Jesus Christ .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if anyone builds on that foundation with gold , silver , and precious stones , or with wood , hay , and straw ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	13	the work of each person will come to light . For the Day [ b ] will disclose it , because it will be revealed with fire , and the fire itself will test the worth of each person ’ s work
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If what has been built survives , the builder will be rewarded .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If it burns down , that person will suffer loss . The person will be saved , though only by passing through fire . [ c ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	16	You Belong to Christ . Do you not realize that you are God ’ s temple , and that the Spirit of God dwells in you ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If anyone destroys God ’ s temple , God will destroy that person . For the temple of God is holy , and you are that temple .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no one delude himself . If anyone among you considers himself to be wise by worldly standards , he must become a fool in order to be truly wise .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . It is written , “ He catches the wise in their own craftiness , ”
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	20	and again , “ The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise , that they are futile. ”
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	21	And so , let no one boast about human beings . For everything belongs to you ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	3	22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas , the world or life or death , the present or the future . All belong to you ,

NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	2	However , to avoid the temptation to immorality , each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	3	A husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights , and likewise a wife should fulfill her conjugal obligations to her husband .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	4	For a wife does not have authority over her own body , but the husband does . Likewise , a husband does not have authority over his own body , but the wife does .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not deprive one another , except perhaps by mutual consent for a specified time so as to devote yourselves to prayer . Then come together again so that Satan may not tempt you by taking advantage of your lack of self-control .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	6	I suggest this not as a command but by way of concession .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	8	To the unmarried and to widows , I say that it is a good thing for them to remain as they are , as I do .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	9	However , if they are unable to exercise self-control , they should marry , for it is better to be married than to burn with passion .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	10	To those who are married , I give this command , which is not mine but the Lord ’ s : a wife should not separate from her husband—
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	11	and if she does separate , she must either remain unmarried or become reconciled to her husband—and a husband should not divorce his wife .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	16	As a wife , how can you be certain that you will save your husband ? As a husband , how can you be certain that you will save your wife ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Living Where Christ Calls Us . Everyone should accept the role in life assigned to each one by the Lord , continuing as he was when the Lord called him . This is the rule that I give to all the Churches .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was a man called after he had been circumcised ? Then he must remain circumcised . Was a man uncircumcised when he was called ? He should remain uncircumcised .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	19	To be circumcised is of no importance , and to be uncircumcised is of no importance . What matters is keeping God ’ s commandments .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Everyone should remain as he was when he was called .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called ? Do not let that concern you . But if you have an opportunity to gain your freedom , take it .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For whoever was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord , just as whoever was free when he was called is a slave of Christ .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	23	You were purchased at a price . Do not become slaves of men .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Therefore , brethren , everyone should remain before God in the condition in which he was called .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Virginity—Total Consecration to Christ . [ d ] In regard to virgins , I have received no instructions from the Lord , but let me offer my own opinion as one who by the Lord ’ s mercy can be considered trustworthy .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I think that in this time of stress , a man should remain in his current state .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek to be free . Are you free of a wife ? Then do not look for a wife .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	28	However , if you do marry , you do not sin , nor does a virgin sin if she marries . But those who marry will experience hardships in this life , [ e ] and from these I would like to spare you .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	29	What I am saying , brethren , is that our time is short . From now on , those who have wives should live as though they had none ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	30	and those who mourn as though they were not mourning , and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing , and those who buy as though they had nothing ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	31	and those who make use of the world as though they had no dealings with it . For the world as we know it is passing away .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	32	It is my wish that you be free of all anxieties . An unmarried man devotes himself to the Lord ’ s affairs and is concerned as to how he can please the Lord .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	33	However , a man who is married devotes himself to worldly matters and is concerned about how he can please his wife ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and his interests are divided . In the same way , an unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord and strives to be holy in both body and spirit , whereas the married woman is concerned about worldly matters and how she may please her husband .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am speaking about this for your own good . I have no intention to impose any restraint upon you , but I wish you to be guided by a sense of propriety , to devote yourself to the Lord free from distraction .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	36	Freedom To Marry . [ f ] If a man feels that he is behaving improperly toward his virgin because a critical moment has come [ g ] and it seems that something should be done , let him do what he wills . He does not sin if there is a marriage .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	37	However , if he stands firm in his resolve and is under no obligation and , being free to carry out his will , decides in his heart to keep his virgin , he also does well .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	38	Therefore , the man who gives her in marriage does well , and the one who does not give her in marriage does better .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But should the husband die , she is free to marry anyone she wishes , only let it be in the Lord .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	7	40	However , in my opinion she is happier if she remains as she is , and I believe that I too have the Spirit of God . Footnotes -

NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	8	Obviously , food can not bring us closer to God . We do not lack anything if we do not eat , and we have no advantage if we do .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	2	Anyone who believes that his knowledge about something is complete will soon discover that his knowledge is flawed ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	3	but anyone who loves God is known by him .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	4	Now in regard to the eating of meat sacrificed to idols , we know that idols are nothing in the world and that there is only one God .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	5	Indeed , even though there are so-called gods in heaven and on earth—and there are in fact many gods and many lords—
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	6	for us there is one God , the Father , from whom all things are and for whom we exist , [ b ] and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom all things are and through whom we exist . Do Not Cause a Brother To Fall .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	7	However , not everyone possesses this knowledge . There are some who have become so accustomed to idolatry up until now that when they consume meat that has been sacrificed to an idol , their conscience in its weakness is defiled .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	9	Just take care that your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	10	If someone who regards you as knowledgeable observes you eating in an idol ’ s temple , will he not , burdened by a weak conscience , be influenced to eat food that has been sacrificed to idols ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	11	Therefore , through your knowledge , this weak believer is brought to destruction , the brother for whom Christ died .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	12	And when you sin against your brethren and wound their weak consciences , you sin against Christ .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Hence , if food can lead my brother to sin , I will never again eat meat lest I cause the downfall of one of my brethren . Footnotes -
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians 9:24 To take part in a sacred meal in the temples of idols is to run the risk of being seduced by idolatry . The reader should not play down this danger , which is connected with the danger of scandalizing the weak .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	3	To those who seek to pass judgment on me , my defense is this .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Do we not have the right to eat and drink ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife like the other apostles , the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ? [ a ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Are Barnabas [ b ] and I the only ones who do not have the right to refrain from working ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	7	What soldier would ever serve in the army at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard without eating its fruit ? Or who tends a flock without consuming some of its milk ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	8	I am not saying this based simply on human authority , for the Law says the very same thing .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	10	or does he not rather say this for our sake ? Without question it was written for our sake , for whoever plows should plow in hope and whoever threshes should thresh in hope , both in expectation of a share in the crop .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown a spiritual crop for you , is it unreasonable for us to expect from you a material harvest ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others have this claim on you , do not we ? Despite this , we have never availed ourselves of any such right . On the contrary , we put up with anything rather than place an obstacle to the gospel of Christ .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do you not know that those who perform the temple service receive their food from the temple , and that those who officiate at the altar share in the offerings ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	14	In the same way , the Lord ordered that those who preach the gospel should get their living from the gospel . [ c ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	15	I Have Become All Things to All . However , I have never availed myself of any of these rights , and I have not written this to influence you to grant me such treatment ; I would rather die first . No one shall deprive me of this boast !
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	16	If I proclaim the gospel , that is no reason for me to boast , for the obligation to do so has been given to me , and woe to me if I fail to fulfill it .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	17	If I proclaimed the gospel of my own volition , I would deserve a reward ; but if I do not do so voluntarily , I am simply discharging the commission that has been given to me .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What then is my reward ? It is simply that in my preaching I may offer the gospel free of charge and not make use of the rights that the gospel affords me .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	19	Although I am free and belong to no man , I have made myself a slave to all so as to win over as many as possible .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	20	To the Jews , I became like a Jew in order to win the Jews . To those under the Law , I became like one under the Law—although I myself am not under the Law—in order to win over those under the Law .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To those outside the Law , I became like one outside the Law—although I am not outside the Law of God but am subject to the Law of Christ—in order to win over those outside the Law .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak , I have become weak in order to win over the weak . I have become all things to all , so that by every possible means I might save some .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	23	I do all this for the sake of the gospel so that I might share it with you . Flee from Idolatry [ d ]
NCB	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Discipline Yourself So As Not To Be Disqualified . You are well aware that while all the runners in the stadium compete in the race , only one wins the prize . Run in such a way as to win the prize .

But if the fraternal bond created by communion loosens , as at Corinth , the community becomes disunited in spirit and in body .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	11	6	Indeed , if a woman refuses to wear a veil , then she might as well have her hair cut off . If it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , then she should wear a veil .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	11	7	It is not right for a man to have his head covered , since he is the image of God and the reflection of his glory , whereas woman is the reflection of the glory of man .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same fashion , after the supper , [ g ] he also took the cup and said , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Whenever you drink it , do this in remembrance of me. ”

NCB	1%20Corinthians	12	10	To one , is granted the gift of mighty deeds ; [ d ] to another , the gift of prophecy ; and to yet another , the gift to discern spirits . One receives the gift of tongues and another the ability to interpret them .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	12	11	One and the same Spirit works all these things , distributing them individually to each person as he wills .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , Jews as well as Greeks , slaves as well as free men , and we were all given the same Spirit to drink .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I wish that all of you could speak in tongues , but I would much prefer that you could prophesy . For the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , unless the latter can interpret what he is saying so that the Church may be built up .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Now suppose , brethren , that I should come to you and speak in tongues . Of what value would I be to you if you were unable to discern from my words any revelation or knowledge or prophecy or instruction ?

NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Clearly , then , tongues are intended as a sign not for believers but for unbelievers , while prophecy is designed not for unbelievers but for believers .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	23	Therefore , if the whole Church has assembled and everyone is speaking in tongues , would not any uninstructed person or any unbeliever on entering conclude that you are all out of your minds ?
NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	24	However , if everyone is prophesying and an unbeliever or uninstructed person should enter , he would be reproved by all and judged by all ,

NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	34	[ c ] women are to keep silent at the assemblies . For they are not permitted to speak , since the Law asserts that they are to be subordinate .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	35	If there is anything they wish to know , they should ask their husbands at home . It is improper for them to speak in the church .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	14	38	Anyone who does not acknowledge this should be ignored .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	35	The Resurrected Body . Someone may ask , “ How are the dead raised ? What sort of body will they have when they come back ? ”
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	36	This is foolish . What you sow must die before it is given new life ,
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	37	and what you sow is not the body that is to be but a bare grain of wheat or of something else .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	38	God gives to it a body that he has chosen , and to each kind of seed its own particular body .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	39	Not all flesh is alike . There is one kind for human beings , another for animals , another for birds , and another for fish .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies . The splendor of heavenly bodies is of one kind , and that of earthly bodies is another .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The sun has a splendor of its own , the moon another splendor , and the stars still another . Indeed , the stars differ among themselves in splendor .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So it is with the resurrection of the dead . What is sown is perishable ; what is raised is imperishable .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	43	What is sown in dishonor is raised as glorious . What is sown in weakness is raised in power .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	44	What is sown is a physical body ; what is raised is a spiritual body . The Natural and the Spiritual Body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual body .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	45	As it is written , the first man , Adam , became a living being ; the last Adam has become a lifegiving spirit .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But the spiritual body did not come first . Rather the natural body came first , and then the spiritual .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man was formed from the dust of the earth ; the second man is from heaven .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	48	The man formed from dust is the pattern for earthly people ; the heavenly man is the pattern for those who are of heaven .

NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	54	When this perishable body puts on imperishability , and this mortal body puts on immortality , then will the words that are written be fulfilled : “ Death has been swallowed up in victory .
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	55	Where , O death , is your victory ? Where , O death , is your sting ? ”
NCB	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the Law .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write nothing to you that you can not read and comprehend . It is my hope that you will come to understand fully ,

Difficult as the trial was , it served to clarify and deepen the meaning of the apostolic ministry for Paul , who now has a better grasp of the dimensions of his mission .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	2	1	Therefore , I made up my mind not to have you endure another painful visit .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote as I did , so that when I came I would not suffer distress from those who should have made me rejoice . I know all of you well enough to be certain that we both share the same joy .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	4	3	If our gospel is veiled , it is veiled to those who are perishing ,
NCB	2%20Corinthians	4	5	We do not proclaim ourselves . Rather we proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and ourselves as your servants for the sake of Jesus .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	4	7	However , we hold this treasure in earthen vessels so that it may be clear that this immense power belongs to God and does not derive from us .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	4	12	As a result , death is at work in us , but life in you .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	2	Corinthians 5:21 This is a splendid summary of the redemption . God made the penalty for sins to fall on Jesus ( see Isa 53:6 ; Gal 3:13 ) . Christ , the only one who is entirely righteous , took our sins upon himself at Calvary and endured the punishment reserved for us , i.e. , death and separation from God . He made it possible for us to receive his righteousness and be recommended to God . Yet all this stems from the love of the Father , who prompted Christ by his plan and enabled him to bring it about by his grace .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	5	God is the one who has prepared us for this destiny , and he has given us the Spirit as a pledge of this .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	1	Now we know that if the earthly tent in which we live is destroyed , we have a dwelling prepared for us by God , a dwelling in the heavens , not made with human hands , that will be eternal .

NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	4	While we are enclosed in this earthly tent we groan , burdened because we do not wish to be stripped naked but rather to be further clothed , so that our mortal state may be swallowed up by immortality .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore , we are always confident , even though we realize that as long as we are at home in the body , we are exiles from the Lord ,
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	7	for we walk by faith , not by sight .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	8	Yet we are filled with confidence , even as we long to be exiled from the body and be at home with the Lord .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	9	For this reason , whether at home or away , we strive to please him .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ , so that each one may receive suitable recompense for his conduct in the body , whether good or bad .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Well Known to God . And so , with this fear of the Lord always foremost in our thoughts , we try to persuade others . We ourselves are well known to God , and I hope we are also well known to your consciences .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	12	We are not once again commending ourselves to you , but we are rather affording you an opportunity to boast about us . Then you will have an answer to those who boast of external appearances and not the heart .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	13	If , indeed , we are out of our minds , it is for God ; if we are rational , it is for your sake .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	14	The Ministry of Reconciliation . For the love of Christ urges us forward , once we conclude that one has died for all , and therefore all have died .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And he died for all , so that those who live might no longer live for themselves , but for him who for their sakes died and was raised to life .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Therefore , from now on we will not regard anyone according to human standards . Even though we once judged Christ from a human point of view , [ b ] we no longer do so .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Consequently , anyone united to Christ is a new creation . The old order has passed away . Behold , all has become new .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	18	All this has been done by God , who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and entrusted us with the ministry of reconciliation .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	19	In other words , God was in Christ , reconciling the world to himself , and not holding people ’ s transgressions against them , and he committed to us the message of reconciliation .
NCB	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Therefore , we are ambassadors for Christ , since God is appealing to you through us . We implore you through Christ to be reconciled to God .

First of all , Paul furnishes proofs of the authenticity of his apostolate . He specifies that his call comes directly from Christ and the Father . He received his Gospel by an immediate revelation from Christ , began at once to proclaim it without asking for the authorization of any human person , and on coming to Jerusalem interacted on an equal plane with the apostles , who approved his evangelization of the Gentiles . Finally , in the incident at Antioch , he showed his independence of Peter . This first part of the Letter is one of our best sources of information about the history of the newborn Church and the life of Paul . - Galatians 1:1 Without taking the time for another introduction , Paul tells us how he sees his apostolate in Christ ’ s work of salvation . One must read these lines in order to understand what constitutes a mission of the Church . This Letter will be the “ Gospel of the Cross. ” In his address , Paul sets forth his name , his mission as apostle , and the name of those to whom he is writing as well as the central teaching of the Christian faith—the Resurrection of Jesus ( see Acts 17:18 ; Rom 1:4 ;
NCB	Galatians	2	2	Cor 8–9 ) . - Galatians 2:11 The Council of Jerusalem had acknowledged the freedom of Gentile Christians from the Jewish Law , but the question of table fellowship between Jewish Christians and Gentile believers was not yet settled . When Peter came to Antioch , he at first ate with non-Jews , since faith in Christ brings all people together . But when Jewish Christians arrived from Jerusalem , he gave up doing so . Paul rebuked Peter ’ s inconsistency in an important religious matter . Peter ’ s behavior was clearly wrong , and even grievously wrong if the table fellowship in question involved the meal at the Lord ’ s Supper ( see
NCB	Galatians	2	1	Cor 11:17-25 ) . The reason why Jews would not eat with Gentiles was that they were considered to be unclean . If Peter was refusing to eat with Gentile Christians , he was implicitly saying that they were still in sin , which would mean that their Baptism had no effect , which meant that their cross did not redeem them . - Galatians 2:12 Some people came from James : i.e. , Jewish Christians who still believed in the Law and in circumcision ( Acts 15:1 ,
NCB	Galatians	2	3	Yet not even Titus , who was accompanying me , was compelled to be circumcised , even though he was a Greek .
NCB	Galatians	2	4	Yet some false brethren were secretly brought in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus , so that they might reduce us to slavery .
NCB	Galatians	2	5	; 21:20f ) and either came from James or claimed to be from him . Circumcised : i.e. , Jewish Christians . - Galatians 2:13 Jews : i.e. , Jewish Christians . - Galatians 2:15 Paul has explained his view of the apostolate ; almost by degrees he now passes on to the defense of freedom for the new converts . He reverses the accusation brought against him . Indeed , one can falsify the Gospel by making the practices of the Jewish Law a prerequisite for becoming Christian . Faith in Christ , and it alone , saves believers and sets them free . Paul sketches his thinking about Baptism and about the indissoluble bond that must exist between faith and the Sacrament . - Galatians 2:15 Law or faith : the famous antithesis . Two religious outlooks are opposed : to accept the one is to reject the other . Christianity ’ s purpose is not to produce a better Law but to offer faith . On one side , there is an objective , external norm of good and evil , and even a slavery ; on the other side , there is a principle of internal action , a spiritual dynamism , a call , even more the very life of God in the heart of human beings , a freedom .
NCB	Galatians	2	6	As for those who were regarded as men of importance—whether or not they actually were important makes no difference to me , nor does it matter to God—these men did not add anything further to my message .
NCB	Galatians	2	7	On the contrary , they realized that I had been entrusted with preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised , just as Peter had been entrusted with preaching the gospel to the circumcised (
NCB	Galatians	2	8	for the one who worked through Peter in his mission to the Jews was also at work in me in my mission to the Gentiles ) .
NCB	Galatians	2	9	Therefore , when James and Cephas and John , who were acknowledged as pillars of the community , recognized the grace that had been bestowed upon me , they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship , agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles while they concentrated on the Jews .
NCB	Galatians	2	10	They asked only one thing : that we remember the poor , which is the very thing I was eager to do . Paul Rebukes Peter [ b ]
NCB	Galatians	2	11	Peter ’ s Inconsistency at Antioch . However , when Cephas came to Antioch , I opposed him to his face , because he was in the wrong .
NCB	Galatians	2	12	For until some people came from James , [ c ] he had been eating with the Gentiles ; but when they arrived , he drew back and kept himself apart because he was afraid of the circumcised .
NCB	Galatians	2	13	And the rest of the Jews [ d ] carried out the same pretense that he did , so that even Barnabas was led astray by their pretense .
NCB	Galatians	2	14	Paul ’ s Rebuke . But when I saw that their conduct was not in accordance with the truth of the gospel , I said to Peter in front of all of them , “ You are a Jew , yet you are living like a Gentile and not like a Jew . How then can you require the Gentiles to live like Jews ? ” Paul Defends the Freedom of Christians [ e ] It Is Faith That Saves [ f ] Justified by Faith in Christ . [ g ] We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners , [ h ]
NCB	Galatians	2	16	yet we know that a man is justified not by the works of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ . So we too came to believe in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by faith in him and not by the works of the Law , for no one will be justified by the works of the Law .
NCB	Galatians	2	17	But if , in seeking to be justified in Christ , we ourselves are found to be sinners , is Christ then a servant of sin ? By no means !
NCB	Galatians	2	18	However , if I am now rebuilding what I previously tore down , then I prove myself to be a transgressor .
NCB	Galatians	2	19	For through the Law I died to the Law [ i ] so that I might live to God . I have been crucified with Christ .
NCB	Galatians	2	20	And now it is no longer I who live , but it is Christ who lives in me . The life I live now in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me .
NCB	Galatians	2	21	I do not set aside the grace of God , for if justification comes through the Law , then Christ died for nothing . Footnotes - Galatians 2:1 Despite slight differences of detail , the passage speaks of the same assembly in Jerusalem that Acts
NCB	Galatians	2	15	Christianity can not shut itself up in a code , no matter how noble ; it is a Person , and Christians are those in whom Christ lives ( Gal 2:20 ) and the Spirit acts ( Gal 4:6 ) . If there is a moral for Christians , a “ law of Christ ” ( Gal 6:2 ) , it can only be the living and free expression of the love that God inspires in the human heart : “ You shall love ! ” - Galatians 2:15 The baptized must not look elsewhere : Christ has become their very self , and faith lays hold of and permeates their entire life . This statement of Paul is at the same time a self-revelation of a highly mystical nature . - Galatians 2:15 Gentile sinners : a usual formula for describing pagans as opposed to the chosen people . In this passage it has no pejorative meaning ; Paul will in fact say that Jews and Gentiles alike are sinners and in need of redemption ( see Rom 3:23f ) . - Galatians 2:19 I died to the Law : the formula is obscure because it is overly concise . Christians have died to the Law because it left them frustrated since it helped them recognize their brokenness but did not liberate them from that brokenness . Only the love of Jesus can do that .
NCB	Galatians	3	3	How can you be so foolish ? After having begun with the Spirit , are you now ending in the flesh ?
NCB	Galatians	3	1	Tim 5:18 ) . - Galatians 3:19 Because of transgressions : i.e. , in order that transgressions might be brought to light . Where there is no Law , there is no transgression ( see Rom 5:13 ; 7:7 ) . - Galatians 3:23 In a few words , Paul provides great affirmations about faith and Baptism . He gives praise to the Person and work of Christ and to the action of the Holy Spirit . He sets forth the new meaning of the condition of human beings , their divine filiation , and their unity . The mystery of Christianity is found in these few lines .
NCB	Galatians	3	2	I only wish you to tell me this : Did you receive the Spirit by observing the Law or by believing what you heard ?
NCB	Galatians	3	4	Is everything you have suffered to result in absolutely nothing—if indeed it was for nothing ?
NCB	Galatians	3	5	Does God give you the Spirit and work mighty deeds among you because you have kept the Law or because you believed what you have heard ? The Blessing of Abraham . [ a ]
NCB	Galatians	3	6	Thus Abraham believed in God , and it was credited to him as righteousness .
NCB	Galatians	3	7	You can be assured that those who have faith are children of Abraham .
NCB	Galatians	3	8	Because Scripture foresaw [ b ] that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , it declared the gospel beforehand to Abraham , saying , “ In you all the nations will be blessed. ”
NCB	Galatians	3	9	For this reason , those who have faith share the blessing with Abraham , the faithful one .
NCB	Galatians	3	10	The Curse of the Law . In contrast , those who rely on the works of the Law are under a curse , for it is written “ Cursed is everyone who does not persevere in doing all the things that are written in the book of the Law. ”
NCB	Galatians	3	11	Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the Law , for the one who is righteous will live by faith .
NCB	Galatians	3	12	However , the Law is not based on faith . On the contrary , whoever does these things shall live by them .
NCB	Galatians	3	13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse himself for us , as it is written , “ Cursed is everyone who is hung upon a tree. ”
NCB	Galatians	3	14	This is so that the blessing bestowed upon Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
NCB	Galatians	3	15	The Promise of the Covenant . Brethren , allow me to give you an everyday example . Once a human will has been ratified , no one can make further additions to it or set it aside .
NCB	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were made to Abraham and his descendant . It does not say “ and to your descendants , ” as referring to many , but it says “ and to your descendant , ” that is , to one person , who is Christ .
NCB	Galatians	3	17	This is what I am saying : the Law , which came four hundred and thirty years later , can not invalidate a covenant that had been previously ratified by God , so as to nullify the promise .
NCB	Galatians	3	18	Obviously , if the inheritance comes from the Law , it no longer comes from the promise . However , God bestowed it on Abraham through a promise .
NCB	Galatians	3	19	The Purpose of the Law . Why then ? It was added because of transgressions [ c ] until the descendant appeared to whom the promise had been made , and it was promulgated by angels through an intermediary .
NCB	Galatians	3	20	Now an intermediary is not necessary when there is only one party , and God is one .
NCB	Galatians	3	21	Is the Law then opposed to the promises of God ? Absolutely not ! If the Law that had been given had the power to bestow life , then righteousness would have come through the Law .
NCB	Galatians	3	22	But according to Scripture all things have been confined under sin , so that through faith in Jesus Christ what was promised might be given to those who believe .
NCB	Galatians	3	23	The Benefit of Faith . [ d ] Now before faith came , we were prisoners of the Law , confined as we waited for the faith that would eventually be revealed .
NCB	Galatians	3	24	Therefore , the Law was our tutor to bring us to Christ , so that we might be justified by faith .
NCB	Galatians	3	25	However , now that faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor .
NCB	Galatians	3	26	Children of God in Christ . Through faith you are all children of God in Christ Jesus .
NCB	Galatians	3	27	For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves in Christ .
NCB	Galatians	3	28	There is no longer Jew or Greek , there is no longer slave or free man , there is no longer male or female . For all of you are one in Christ Jesus .
NCB	Galatians	3	29	And if you are Christ ’ s , then you are the offspring of Abraham and heirs according to the promise . Footnotes - Galatians 3:6 God has a blessing for humankind ; it is reserved to faith . The promise made to Abraham was a personal , free , and direct commitment of God , and such it remained and still remains for all human beings ; it is this promise that Christ fulfills . - Galatians 3:8 Scripture foresaw : Paul personifies Scripture , thus stressing its divine origin ( see
NCB	Galatians	4	4	However , when the fullness of time had come , God sent his Son , born of a woman , born under the Law ,
NCB	Galatians	4	1	What I am saying is that as long as an heir is a minor , he is no different from a slave , even though he is the owner of it all .
NCB	Galatians	4	2	He remains under the supervision of guardians and trustees until the date designated by the father .
NCB	Galatians	4	3	This is also true of us . As long as we were children , we were enslaved to the forces of this world .
NCB	Galatians	4	5	in order to redeem those who were under the Law , so that we might receive adoption as sons .
NCB	Galatians	4	6	And because you are sons , God has sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son , crying out “ Abba ! Father ! ”
NCB	Galatians	4	7	Therefore , you are no longer a slave but a son ; and if you are a son , then through God you are also an heir . No Return to Slavery . [ a ]
NCB	Galatians	4	8	Previously , when you did not know God , you were slaves to forces who were not really gods at all .
NCB	Galatians	4	9	But now that you have come to know God—or rather to be known by God—how can you turn back once again to those powerless and destitute forces ? How can you consider becoming enslaved once again ?
NCB	Galatians	4	10	You even observe special days and months and seasons and years .
NCB	Galatians	4	11	Now I am afraid for you , that I have labored among you in vain .
NCB	Galatians	4	12	Appeal To Enter into Freedom from the Law . I beg you , brethren , to be like me , just as I have become like you . You never did me any wrong .
NCB	Galatians	4	13	As you remember , it was because of illness [ b ] that I originally preached the gospel to you .
NCB	Galatians	4	14	And though my illness was a trial to you , it did not lead to any scorn or revulsion ; rather , you welcomed me as an angel of God , as if I were Christ Jesus himself .
NCB	Galatians	4	15	What has become of your blessedness ? For I can testify that , if it had been possible , you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me .
NCB	Galatians	4	16	Have I now become your enemy because I have told you the truth ?
NCB	Galatians	4	17	Others are seeking to curry your favor , but they are not sincere . They are attempting to alienate you from us so that you may make them the sole object of your attention .
NCB	Galatians	4	18	It is good to be made much of for a good purpose at all times , and not just when I am in your presence .
NCB	Galatians	4	19	You are my children , and I am experiencing the pain of giving birth to you all over again , until Christ is formed in you .
NCB	Galatians	4	20	I truly wish that I could be with you now and be able to alter my approach to you , because I do not know what to think about you .
NCB	Galatians	4	21	Sarah and Hagar Foreshadow the Two Covenants . [ c ] And so tell me , you who are so eager to be subject to the Law : why do you not listen to the Law ?
NCB	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by a slave woman and one by a free woman .
NCB	Galatians	4	23	The son by the slave woman was born through the flesh . The son by the free woman was born through a promise .
NCB	Galatians	4	24	Now this is an allegory . These women represent two covenants . One covenant is given on Mount Sinai and bears children who are born into slavery ; this is Hagar .
NCB	Galatians	4	25	Hagar stands for Sinai , a mountain in Arabia , and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem , for she is in slavery together with her children .
NCB	Galatians	4	26	However , the Jerusalem that is above is the free woman , and she is our mother .
NCB	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , “ Rejoice , you barren woman who never bore a child ; break forth in song and shout with joy , you who never were in labor . For more numerous are the children of the deserted wife than the children of the one who has a husband. ”
NCB	Galatians	4	28	Now you , brethren , are , like Isaac , the children of the promise .
NCB	Galatians	4	29	But just as in those days the child who was born through the flesh persecuted the child who was born through the Spirit , so is it now also .
NCB	Galatians	4	30	However , what does Scripture say ? “ Drive out the slave woman and her son ! For the son of the slave woman shall not share the inheritance with the son of the free woman. ”
NCB	Galatians	4	31	Therefore , brethren , we are the children not of the slave woman but of the free woman . Footnotes - Galatians 4:8 The baptized have suddenly become concerned with the calendar of Jewish feasts or of pagan cults ; do they , then , believe themselves to be slaves of the forces that they think rule the world and do they therefore desire to conciliate those forces by rites ? God is not to be confused with any force , known or unknown , of this world . - Galatians 4:13 Illness : a sickness , of what kind we do not know , that afflicted Paul during his second missionary journey ( see Acts 16:6 ) . - Galatians 4:21 A famous allegory , but one that is obscure and subtle for the modern reader . Paul wants to show by means of the Old Testament itself that we must go beyond the Law . In this perspective , he gives a free interpretation of an incident in the life of Abraham ( see Gen 16:15 ; 21:2-14 ) . The text explains the meaning of the enmity between two women , two descendants , two cities , two covenants .
NCB	Galatians	5	5	For it is through the Spirit and by faith that we eagerly hope to attain righteousness ,
NCB	Galatians	5	1	Cor 6:9f ; Eph 5:5 ; Rev 22:15 . - Galatians 5:22 For other lists of virtues , see
NCB	Galatians	5	2	Cor 6:6 ; Eph 4:2 ; 5:9 ; Col 3:12-15 . Paul stresses that justification by faith does not mean advocating libertinism . He stresses that the Holy Spirit brings forth in believers Christian virtues and he lists nine of them . These have come to be known as “ the fruits of the Holy Spirit. ” The text of the Vulgate originally listed three other fruits , making a total of twelve . This formed the basis for the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit listed in older catechisms , e.g. , the Baltimore Catechism : charity , joy , peace , patience , benignity , goodness , long-suffering , mildness , faith , modesty , continence , and chastity . In truth , the three fruits not named in the original Greek are contained in one or other of the nine named : “ long-suffering ” in patience , and “ modesty ” and “ continence ” in self-control .
NCB	Galatians	5	3	Once again , I testify that every man who accepts circumcision is under obligation to observe the entire Law .
NCB	Galatians	5	4	Those of you who seek to be justified by the Law have cut yourselves off from Christ and have fallen away from grace .
NCB	Galatians	5	6	since in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor lack of circumcision is worth anything . All that matters is faith expressing itself through love . Against Being Misled .
NCB	Galatians	5	7	You were running a good race . Who kept you from obeying the truth ?
NCB	Galatians	5	8	This change did not come from the one who called you .
NCB	Galatians	5	9	A little yeast leavens the entire batch of dough .
NCB	Galatians	5	10	I am confident of you in the Lord that none of you will think differently , and that anyone who is trying to confuse you will be condemned , no matter who it is .
NCB	Galatians	5	11	As for me , brethren , if I were still advocating circumcision , [ b ] why would I continue to be persecuted ? If I were doing that , the cross would no longer be a stumbling block .
NCB	Galatians	5	12	I wish that those who are confusing you would even castrate themselves !
NCB	Galatians	5	13	Proper Use of Freedom . Brethren , you were called to freedom . However , make sure that you do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh . Instead , serve one another in love .
NCB	Galatians	5	14	For the entire Law can be summed up [ c ] in a single commandment : “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NCB	Galatians	5	15	But if you continue biting and tearing one another to pieces , at least be on your guard lest you be consumed by one another .
NCB	Galatians	5	16	Hence , I advise you to be guided by the Spirit , so that you will not gratify the desires of the flesh .
NCB	Galatians	5	17	For the desires of the flesh are opposed to the Spirit , and those of the Spirit are opposed to the flesh . They are in conflict with one another , so that you can not do what you want .
NCB	Galatians	5	18	But if you are guided by the Spirit , you are not subject to the Law .
NCB	Galatians	5	19	[ d ] Now the works of the flesh are obvious : fornication , impurity , licentiousness ,
NCB	Galatians	5	20	idolatry , sorcery , enmities , strife , jealousy , anger , quarrels , dissensions , factions ,
NCB	Galatians	5	21	envy , drunkenness , carousing , and the like . I warn you , as I warned you previously , that no one who does such things will inherit the kingdom of God .
NCB	Galatians	5	22	[ e ] In contrast , the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , patience , kindness , generosity , faithfulness ,
NCB	Galatians	5	23	gentleness , and self-control . There is no law against such things .
NCB	Galatians	5	24	And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires .
NCB	Galatians	5	25	If we live by the Spirit , let us also be guided by the Spirit .
NCB	Galatians	5	26	We should not become conceited , or provoke one another , or be envious of one another . Footnotes - Galatians 5:1 After an involved argumentation , Paul turns to a more direct style , using shorter sentences , and he becomes more pressing . He calls upon the Galatians to measure the gravity of their about-face . Any compromise is out of the question ; they must choose between the Law and Christ . - Galatians 5:11 Advocating circumcision : probably an accusation by Paul ’ s opponents that he also had advocated circumcision since he had allowed Timothy ( whose mother was Jewish ) to be circumcised ( Acts 16:1-3 ) . Cross . . . stumbling block : see

NCB	Galatians	6	3	If anyone thinks he is something when in fact he is nothing , he is only deceiving himself .
NCB	Galatians	6	4	Each person must examine his own work . Then he will have reason to boast with regard to himself alone and not in comparison with someone else .
NCB	Galatians	6	5	For everyone has his own burden to bear .
NCB	Galatians	6	7	Do not be deceived ; God can not be mocked . A person will reap only what he sows .
NCB	Galatians	6	8	The one who sows in his flesh will reap a harvest of corruption , but the one who sows in the Spirit will reap from the Spirit the reward of eternal life .
NCB	Galatians	6	9	Let us never grow weary in doing what is right , for if we do not give up , we will reap our harvest in due time .
NCB	Galatians	6	10	Therefore , while we have the opportunity , let us labor for the good of all , but especially for those members of the household of the faith . Conclusion [ b ]
NCB	Galatians	6	11	) and for one last time situates the problem of the Galatians before the mystery of the cross . There is an old world , that of circumcisions and human successes , and a new world , in which God calls the new Israel , i.e. , all Christians , true children of Abraham . Christians belong to this world . For them , the cross is something to be shared . They agree to suffer for Christ and with him . It involves more suffering than being circumcised , but they have become “ new ” people (
NCB	Galatians	6	12	It is those who want to gain human approval who are trying to compel you to be circumcised , their sole purpose being to escape persecution for the cross of Christ .
NCB	Galatians	6	13	Even the circumcised do not themselves obey the Law . They want you to be circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh .
NCB	Galatians	6	14	May I never boast of anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world is crucified to me and I to the world .
NCB	Galatians	6	15	Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is important , but only a new creation .
NCB	Galatians	6	16	Blessing and a Plea . May peace and mercy be given to all who follow this rule , and to the Israel of God . [ c ]
NCB	Galatians	6	17	In the future , let no one make trouble for me , for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body .
NCB	Galatians	6	18	May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit , brethren . Amen . Footnotes - Galatians 6:1 To the spiritual urge that leads the believer to live in solidarity with others and in service to them , Paul gives the name law of Christ ( 6:2 ) , law of faith ( Rom 3:27 ) , and law of the Spirit of life ( Rom 8:2 ) . - Galatians 6:11 Paul himself underlines the importance of the Letter ( v.
NCB	Ephesians	1	1	Cor 12:12 ; Col 1:18 ) . The Apostle then goes on to describe the sinful state of humankind , in the grip of the power of evil ( Eph 2:1-10 ) , and the new state of humankind in which Gentiles and Jews now form a single new person , created in Christ and reconciled to one another and to God ( Eph 2:11-22 ) . - Ephesians 1:18 Inheritance : a Biblical word signifying what God promised to the chosen people . This was initially identified with the land and the blessings connected with it . But as revelation progressed , the true meaning of the “ inheritance ” was increasingly understood , until its definitive content was revealed in the New Testament : the inheritance is the state of the risen Jesus himself , communicated to those who believe in him .
NCB	Ephesians	1	2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . The Risen Christ , Lord and Savior of the Whole Human Race [ c ] God ’ s Glorious Plan of Salvation [ d ] Conceived by the Father

NCB	Ephesians	1	8	God lavished on us all wisdom and insight .
NCB	Ephesians	1	9	He has made known to us the mystery of his will in accordance with his good pleasure that he had predetermined in Christ
NCB	Ephesians	1	10	to be realized when the fullness of time had been achieved : namely , the plan to bring all things , both in heaven and on earth , together [ f ] in Christ as the head . Fulfilled by the Holy Spirit
NCB	Ephesians	1	11	) , he simply wishes to indicate that salvation is a grace for all the People of God , that it is the fulfillment of God ’ s plan . - Ephesians 1:3 These verses form a single sentence in the Greek . In it Paul sets forth the blessings that we have from the Father , then those from the Son , and finally those from the Holy Spirit . - Ephesians 1:7 Redemption : Paul uses the Greco-Roman practice of redeeming slaves by the payment of ransom to show what Christian redemption means . Christ ’ s death ( “ his blood ” ) constitutes the ransom necessary to free sinners from the bondage of sin and the curse of the Law ( see Gal 3:13 ) . - Ephesians 1:10 Bring . . . together : i.e. , “ recapitulate. ” The Greek verb contains two ideas : to gather together or unite and to place under a rule or head . - Ephesians 1:14 Down payment : for “ if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , then the one who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you ” ( Rom 8:11 ) . - Ephesians 1:15 Our spirit is gripped with admiration before the diverse aspects of the mystery of Christ : Resurrection , Ascension , universal Kingship , mysterious and activating presence in the Church . The power of God is present in this mystery and sweeps away every other force . And with Christ rises the Church , the community of those called .

NCB	Ephesians	1	13	) and Jews ( vv . 11-12 ) , the two groups whose irreconcilable antagonism is the sign of the broken unity of the human family . And all the forces of the universe—notably the “ heavenly forces ” : i.e. , angels or demons , secret powers of fatality or fecundity to whom religions customarily give names—are carried along in this élan of rebirth and accomplishment . The universe is led to peace under the authority of Christ . There is thus a grand meaning to the world and to history ! Henceforth , the gift of the Spirit enables Christians to live by it . Indeed , there is a fulfillment of human beings , an “ inheritance , ” as the Bible says when it wishes to sum up in a word the blessings promised to believers . The Spirit , who is presently at work in the Church , is the pledge of this inheritance . Since the Resurrection of Jesus , this redeemed universe , i.e. , a universe delivered from sin and the Law and placed under God ’ s plan , is being built up by the life of the Church , by the dynamism of the Gospel . However , no one can say that any person is predestined either for salvation or for condemnation . When Paul speaks of choosing and placing apart in advance ( vv .
NCB	Ephesians	1	14	That Spirit is the down payment [ g ] of our inheritance , which we shall share when God has redeemed us as his own possession , to the praise of his glory . The Church ’ s Unity with Christ [ h ] Christ , Head of the Church . Having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and of your love toward all the saints ,
NCB	Ephesians	1	16	I therefore never cease to give thanks to God for you as I remember you in my prayers .
NCB	Ephesians	1	17	I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation to know him .
NCB	Ephesians	1	18	I further pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know the hope to which he has called you , how rich and glorious is his inheritance [ i ] in the saints ,
NCB	Ephesians	1	19	and how immeasurably great is the power that he has exercised toward those who have faith . Such was his mighty power
NCB	Ephesians	1	20	that he exhibited in Christ when he raised him from the dead and enthroned him at his right hand in heaven ,
NCB	Ephesians	1	21	far above every principality and authority , power and dominion , and every other title that can be named , not only in this age but also in the age to come .
NCB	Ephesians	1	22	He has put all things under Christ ’ s feet and has made him the head of the Church ,
NCB	Ephesians	1	23	which is his body , the fullness of him who fills the universe in all its parts . Footnotes - Ephesians 1:1 For the form used at the beginning of each of Paul ’ s Letters , see note on Rom 1:1 . - Ephesians 1:1 In Ephesus : omitted in many manuscripts . - Ephesians 1:3 The style here becomes solemn and liturgical in the manner of the great Jewish blessings , for the Church is celebrating the plan of God . The stages of the divine plan are set forth in a great movement . To God the Father belongs all the initiative to make human beings his children . Everything is realized “ in Christ ” : indeed , the whole movement of the universe is oriented toward Christ as an edifice is built on its cornerstone and held up by it . Christ is at the same time the heart and summit , the movement and purpose of history . He gathers together the whole of humankind , reuniting in the Church both Gentiles ( v.
NCB	Ephesians	1	15	Paul clearly distinguishes the glorified Christ reigning in heaven and his mystical body developing on earth . We can not confuse the Church and the Lord . But they are intimately connected . The community of those called is realized and grows under the impulsion of the life that Christ gives it . This community is the “ fullness ” of God , for in it everything must be reunited to be filled with God ’ s presence and love . The Church is the mystery of grace and charisms , of unity and growth ( see Rom 12:4f ;
NCB	Ephesians	2	2	which were your way of life in this worldly era , [ b ] obeying the ruler of the kingdom of the air , the spirit that is now at work among the children of rebellion .
NCB	Ephesians	2	1	Cor 3:19 ; 5:10 ; 7:31 ; Gal 1:4 ; Tit 2:12 ) . - Ephesians 2:8 We are saved by God ’ s gift , not by the works of the Law ( see Rom 3:20-21 ) . - Ephesians 2:11 On the esplanade of the Jewish temple a wall separated Gentiles from Jews , symbolizing the deep division within humanity . Gentiles seemed definitively excluded from any call of God . The death of Jesus radically alters the situation : Jews and Gentiles alike have access to God ; God ’ s plan embraces the entire human race . - Ephesians 2:12 The covenants : i.e. , those made with Abraham , with Moses , and with David ( see note on Rom 9:4 ) . - Ephesians 2:15 A single new person : i.e. , a new humanity made up of Jews and Gentiles in the Christian community .
NCB	Ephesians	2	3	We too were all numbered among them at one time . We were ruled by our sinful nature , succumbing to the temptations of the flesh and desires . And like all others , we were by nature children of wrath .
NCB	Ephesians	2	4	But God is rich in his mercy , and because he had such great love for us ,
NCB	Ephesians	2	5	he brought us to life with Christ when we were already dead through sin—it is by grace that you have been saved .
NCB	Ephesians	2	6	He raised us up in union with Christ Jesus and enthroned us with him in the heavens ,
NCB	Ephesians	2	7	so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace evidenced by his mercy to us in Christ Jesus .
NCB	Ephesians	2	8	[ c ] For it is by grace that you have been saved through faith . This has not come from you but from the gift of God .
NCB	Ephesians	2	9	It does not come from works , so that no one can boast .
NCB	Ephesians	2	10	For we are God ’ s handiwork , created in Christ Jesus for a life of good works that God had prepared for us to do .
NCB	Ephesians	2	11	Jews and Gentiles Reconciled in the Church . [ d ] Therefore , do not forget that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh , called the uncircumcised by those who refer to themselves as the circumcised because of a physical rite .
NCB	Ephesians	2	12	Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ , excluded from the community of Israel , and foreigners to the covenants [ e ] of promise . You were in the world without hope and without God .
NCB	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus , you who once were far off have been brought near through the blood of Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace , who has made the two into one , by breaking down the barrier of hostility . In his flesh
NCB	Ephesians	2	15	he has abolished the Law with its commandments and ordinances , so that he might create in himself a single new person [ f ] out of the two , thereby making peace ,
NCB	Ephesians	2	16	and that he might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross , thereby putting that enmity to death .
NCB	Ephesians	2	17	Therefore , Jesus came and proclaimed peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near .
NCB	Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have access to the Father in the one Spirit .
NCB	Ephesians	2	19	As a result , you are no longer strangers and foreigners . Rather , you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God ,
NCB	Ephesians	2	20	built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone .
NCB	Ephesians	2	21	Through him the entire structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord .
NCB	Ephesians	2	22	In him you are also being built together into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit . Footnotes - Ephesians 2:1 In Greek , these verses comprise a single sentence . - Ephesians 2:2 This worldly era : i.e. , synonymous with “ rulers of this world. ” It may also refer to the first of the two ages of the world—the present evil age and the age to come ( see
NCB	Ephesians	3	3	and how the mystery was made known to me by a revelation , as I have briefly written .
NCB	Ephesians	3	1	This is the reason why I , Paul , a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— [ b ]
NCB	Ephesians	3	2	For you surely must have heard of the mystery of God ’ s grace that was entrusted to me on your behalf ,
NCB	Ephesians	3	4	Reading this , you will be able to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	3	5	It was not disclosed to human beings in previous generations , but now it has been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ,
NCB	Ephesians	3	6	namely that the Gentiles have become coheirs , members of the same body , and sharers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel . Mission to the Gentiles .
NCB	Ephesians	3	7	I became its minister by God ’ s grace bestowed on me through the working of his power .
NCB	Ephesians	3	8	Although I am the very least of all the saints , this grace was given me : to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ
NCB	Ephesians	3	9	and to enlighten all concerning the administration of the mystery that had been kept hidden throughout the ages in God , the creator of all things .
NCB	Ephesians	3	10	In this way , the wisdom of God in its infinite variety might be made known through the Church to the principalities and powers in the heavens .
NCB	Ephesians	3	11	This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord ,
NCB	Ephesians	3	12	in whom we have free access to God in boldness and confidence because of our faith in him .
NCB	Ephesians	3	13	Therefore , I beg you not to lose heart over my sufferings for you . Truly , they are your glory .
NCB	Ephesians	3	14	. - Ephesians 3:15 Every family : in this case , the family of the human race .
NCB	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family [ c ] in heaven and on earth takes its name .
NCB	Ephesians	3	16	I ask that from the riches of his glory he may grant through his Spirit that you be strengthened with power in your inner being
NCB	Ephesians	3	17	and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith . And I pray that , rooted and grounded in love ,
NCB	Ephesians	3	18	you may have the power to comprehend with all the saints its breadth and length and height and depth ,
NCB	Ephesians	3	19	and know Christ ’ s love even though it is beyond knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God .
NCB	Ephesians	3	20	To him who in all things is able through the power that is at work within us to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine ,
NCB	Ephesians	3	21	to him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus through all generations , forever and ever . Amen . Footnotes - Ephesians 3:1 No one could have foreseen the call and reconciliation of the Gentiles . It is now a fact in the fraternal life of communities and in the spread of the Gospel , announcing the joy of salvation to all peoples . It shows that the mystery of God is being revealed , for in Christ all human beings can now approach God . Since his conversion on the road to Damascus , Paul has had no other desire but to proclaim and manifest this mystery . The Apostle finally completes the prayer that he started several times previously . He asks that God himself may enable believers to comprehend the inexpressible riches of the mystery . This is true not only for the initiated but also for all the “ saints , ” i.e. , all those who have been baptized and called . - Ephesians 3:1 The sentence breaks off and is continued in v.
NCB	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body and one Spirit , as well as one hope to which you have been called by your vocation ,
NCB	Ephesians	4	1	Cor 12:28 . Apostles : mentioned here because of their role in establishing the Church ( see Eph 2:20 ) . In a broader sense , the term “ apostle ” is also applied to Paul ( see Eph 1:1 ) . Prophets : those who brought a message from God appropriate to their people ’ s situation . Evangelists : missionary preachers ( see Acts 2:8 and
NCB	Ephesians	4	2	Tim 4:5 ) , not the writers of the Gospels . Pastors and teachers : those who have pastoral care of the people and feed them with the food of the Scriptures .
NCB	Ephesians	4	3	Make every possible effort to preserve the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace .
NCB	Ephesians	4	5	one Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
NCB	Ephesians	4	6	one God and Father of all , who is over all and through all and in all .
NCB	Ephesians	4	7	But each of us was given grace according to the measure in which Christ allotted it .
NCB	Ephesians	4	8	Therefore , it is written , “ When he ascended to the heights , he took prisoners into captivity and gave gifts to men. ”
NCB	Ephesians	4	9	Now the word “ ascended ” implies that he also descended into the lower regions of the earth .
NCB	Ephesians	4	10	The one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens , so that he might fill all things .
NCB	Ephesians	4	11	It was he who established some as apostles , some as prophets , some as evangelists , and some as pastors and teachers , [ c ]
NCB	Ephesians	4	12	to equip the saints for the work of ministry in building up the body of Christ ,
NCB	Ephesians	4	13	until all of us attain to the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God , to full maturity , as measured by the full stature of Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	4	14	In this way , we will no longer be like children , tossed back and forth by the waves and swept along by every new wind of teaching , emanating from human cunning and craftiness and leading people into error .
NCB	Ephesians	4	15	Rather , professing truth and love , we will in all things grow into him who is the head , Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	4	16	From him , the entire body , joined and held together by every ligament , continues to grow and to build itself up in love , as each part performs its particular function .
NCB	Ephesians	4	17	The Newness of the Christian Life . Therefore , I declare and attest in the Lord that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do , in the futility of their minds .
NCB	Ephesians	4	18	and commenting on the two words that strike him : “ ascended ” and “ gave. ” In his interpretation , the text announces the Ascension of Christ , who had first descended in the Incarnation on earth and even down to the subterranean regions , the place of the shadowy survival of the dead ( see
NCB	Ephesians	4	19	Having lost all sensitivity , they have abandoned themselves to vice , committing every kind of impurity in growing excess .
NCB	Ephesians	4	20	That is not how you learned Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	4	21	Clearly , you were told about him and were taught what the truth is in Jesus .
NCB	Ephesians	4	22	You were taught to cast aside the old self of your former way of life that had been corrupted by its captivating desires .
NCB	Ephesians	4	23	You are to be renewed in the spirit of your minds ,
NCB	Ephesians	4	24	and to clothe yourselves with the new self created in God ’ s image , in the way of uprightness and holiness that belong to the truth .
NCB	Ephesians	4	25	A Life Based on Love . Therefore , cease your lying and speak the truth to each other , for we are all members of one another .
NCB	Ephesians	4	26	If you are angry , do not sin . Do not let the sun set on your anger ,
NCB	Ephesians	4	27	and do not give the devil an opening .
NCB	Ephesians	4	28	Anyone who has been stealing must no longer do so ; rather , let him labor , performing some honest work with his own hands , so that he may have something to share with those in need .
NCB	Ephesians	4	29	Let no foul word ever pass your lips . Say only what is useful for edification , so that your words may benefit your listeners .
NCB	Ephesians	4	30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God who has marked you with his seal for the day of redemption .
NCB	Ephesians	4	31	Remove all forms of bitterness and wrath and anger and shouting and slander , as well as all malice from your lives .
NCB	Ephesians	4	32	Rather , be kind to one another and compassionate , and forgive one another as God has forgiven you in Christ . Footnotes - Ephesians 4:1 Christians must conduct themselves in a manner that befits their calling . First of all , they must have unity in the one body of the Church . Unity requires humility as a preliminary condition and meekness and loving patience in bearing with one another . The chief gifts that Paul has in mind are those that Christ communicates to us after the Ascension . The Spirit of Christ allots to each Christian the measure of Christ needed to fulfill the function of each . This entails a change from one ’ s old self to a new self in Christ . In this connection , six vices are specified to be avoided : lying , anger , stealing , bad language , uncurbed temper , and lust . Although Paul singles out lying to be described as unbecoming for fellow-members of the body of Christ , the same could be said of all vices . - Ephesians 4:1 The plan of God , which Paul has just revealed , is a vision of unity . To explain this , Paul follows rabbinical practice in taking a passage from Ps
NCB	Ephesians	5	5	of the Letter to the Ephesians , following the same theological line of thought , gives us one of the finest passages on the mystery of the Church and the spirituality of marriage . Paul ’ s ideas on marriage may be completed by a reading of
NCB	Ephesians	5	1	Cor 7:1-14 and Col 3:18-19 . - Ephesians 5:26 Cleansing her with water and the word : a reference to Baptism ( pouring of water and sacramental formula ) . Perhaps Paul had in mind the Oriental practice in the purification of a wife .
NCB	Ephesians	5	2	Cor 11:2 ; Rev 19:7 ; 21:2-9 ) . Here Paul goes even further : marriage as such is related to the mystery of Christ and the Church ; the reciprocal love of Christ and the Church becomes the foundation and model for the life of spouses , who ought to be a sign and manifestation of that reciprocal love . There is a profound connection between the oneness of marriage and the oneness of Christ with the Church ; the former reveals the ultimate intention of the creator when he created the human couple : an intention that the first generation of Christians saw in the text of Gen 2:24 ( see Mt 19:5 ; Mk 10:8 ;
NCB	Ephesians	5	3	Indeed , fornication and impurity of any kind , as well as greed , should not even be mentioned among you . Such talk is not fitting for saints .
NCB	Ephesians	5	4	You should never engage in any obscene or foolish or suggestive conversation . All this is completely out of place . Instead , you should rather be engaged in offering thanks to God .
NCB	Ephesians	5	6	Let no one deceive you with worthless arguments . These are the very things that bring down the wrath of God on those who are disobedient .
NCB	Ephesians	5	7	Do not associate with them . Christians Are Children of Light .
NCB	Ephesians	5	8	; 62:4-5 ; Ezek
NCB	Ephesians	5	9	for light produces all goodness and righteousness and truth .
NCB	Ephesians	5	10	Discern what the Lord finds pleasing .
NCB	Ephesians	5	11	Take no part in the fruitless deeds of darkness , but rather seek to expose them .
NCB	Ephesians	5	12	For it is shameful even to speak of what deeds people do in secret .
NCB	Ephesians	5	13	However , everything that is exposed by the light is made visible ,
NCB	Ephesians	5	14	and whatever is made visible is light . Therefore , it is said , [ a ] “ Awake , O sleeper ! Rise from the dead , and Christ will shine on you. ”
NCB	Ephesians	5	15	Therefore , take care to live as intelligent people , and do not be like those who are senseless .
NCB	Ephesians	5	16	; Hos 1:3 ) .
NCB	Ephesians	5	17	Do not be foolish , but recognize what is the will of the Lord .
NCB	Ephesians	5	18	Do not get drunk on wine , which can lead to debauchery . Rather , be filled with the Spirit ,
NCB	Ephesians	5	19	as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs with one another . Sing and chant to the Lord in your hearts ,
NCB	Ephesians	5	20	giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ . Christ and Christian Spouses [ b ] Be Subject to One Another in Christ . Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord .
NCB	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife , just as Christ is the head of the Church , the body of which he is the Savior .
NCB	Ephesians	5	24	Just as the Church is subject to Christ , so also wives must be subject to their husbands in everything .
NCB	Ephesians	5	25	Love One Another in Christ . Husbands , love your wives , just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her
NCB	Ephesians	5	26	in order to sanctify her by cleansing her with water and the word , [ c ]
NCB	Ephesians	5	27	in order to present the Church to himself in splendor , without spot or wrinkle or any such flaw , but holy and without the slightest blemish .
NCB	Ephesians	5	28	In the same way , husbands should love their wives as they do their own bodies . The man who loves his wife loves himself .
NCB	Ephesians	5	29	For no one ever hates his own body ; rather , he nourishes it and cares for it , even as Christ does for the Church ,
NCB	Ephesians	5	30	because we are members of his body .
NCB	Ephesians	5	31	For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and the two shall become one flesh .
NCB	Ephesians	5	32	This is a great mystery . Here I am applying it to Christ and the Church .
NCB	Ephesians	5	33	However , each one of you should love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife should respect her husband . Footnotes - Ephesians 5:14 It is said : the text cited was probably taken from an early Christian liturgical hymn ( see also Isa 26:19 ; 60:1 ) . - Ephesians 5:21 Christianity promotes , in community and in family , a new kind of relationship that is marked by humility and mutual submission . Here is a practical essay on the subject . The Old Testament had a lofty idea of marriage and liked to use the image of spouses to suggest God ’ s faithful love for his people ( Ps
NCB	Ephesians	5	45	; Song 1:3 ; Isa 54:4 ,
NCB	Ephesians	5	21	In the same tradition , Christians compare the relationship of Christ and the Church with a marriage ( Mt 9:15 ; 22:2-4 ; 25:1-13 ; Jn 3:29 ;
NCB	Ephesians	6	6	Do this not just when they are watching you , as if you only had to please human beings , but as slaves of Christ , wholeheartedly carrying out the will of God .
NCB	Ephesians	6	2	“ Honor your father and your mother. ” This is the first commandment that is connected with a promise :
NCB	Ephesians	6	3	“ that it may go well with you and that you may have a long life on earth. ”
NCB	Ephesians	6	4	Fathers , do not provoke your children to anger , but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord . Slaves and Masters .
NCB	Ephesians	6	5	Slaves , be constant in your unwavering obedience to your earthly masters with fear and trembling and with the same heartfelt sincerity that you show to Christ .
NCB	Ephesians	6	7	Do your work willingly , as for the Lord and not for human beings ,
NCB	Ephesians	6	8	knowing that whatever good we may do , whether as slaves or as free men , we will be repaid by the Lord .
NCB	Ephesians	6	9	And masters , treat your slaves fairly . Stop threatening them . Remember that both of you have the same Master in heaven , and he shows no favoritism . The Christian Warfare [ b ]
NCB	Ephesians	6	10	Put On the Armor of God . Finally , find your strength in the Lord and in his mighty power .
NCB	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the deceit of the devil .
NCB	Ephesians	6	12	For we are not struggling against flesh and blood , but against the principalities , the powers , and the cosmic rulers of this present darkness , and against the spirits of evil in the heavens .
NCB	Ephesians	6	13	Therefore , put on the armor of God , so that you will be able to hold fast on the evil day and to hold your ground with all your strength .
NCB	Ephesians	6	14	Stand firm , then , with the belt of truth fastened around your waist , with the breastplate of righteousness clothing you ,
NCB	Ephesians	6	15	and with your feet shod in zeal to proclaim the gospel of peace .
NCB	Ephesians	6	16	In all circumstances , hold in your hand the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one .
NCB	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation as well as the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God .
NCB	Ephesians	6	18	Be Vigilant in Prayer . In all of your prayers and entreaties , pray always in the Spirit . To that end , keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the saints .
NCB	Ephesians	6	19	Pray also for me , so that whenever I open my mouth , I may be given the proper words to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel ,
NCB	Ephesians	6	20	for which I am an ambassador in chains . Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly , as is my duty . Conclusion [ c ]
NCB	Ephesians	6	21	A Personal Message . So that you may know how I am and what I am doing , Tychicus , my beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord , will keep you informed .
NCB	Ephesians	6	22	I am sending him to you for this specific purpose , so that you will know how we are and that your hearts may be encouraged .
NCB	Ephesians	6	23	Final Greeting . May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ grant peace and love with faith to all the brethren .
NCB	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying devotion . Footnotes - Ephesians 6:1 Christian life also gives a new meaning to relations between children and parents . In an age less attentive than ours to the lot of little children , Paul was already emphasizing the responsibility of parents , without denying the duties of the young . The atmosphere he suggests is one of dialogue .
NCB	Ephesians	6	1	Tim 6:1-2 ; Tit 2:9-10 ; Philem ) , but he does foretell new relations between master and slave , since all are equal before God , whatever the differences in their roles and social obligations . - Ephesians 6:10 Christ ’ s triumph over evil and the devil must be appropriated by individual Christians in the human sphere through a kind of spiritual warfare against the malevolent spirits in the heavens . For this , Christians need to be clothed with the armor of God ( see Isa 11:5 ; 59:17 ; see also Wis 5:17-20 ) —a spiritual armor . They must strive to counter the forces of evil by relying on the Gospel and prayer . - Ephesians 6:21 Paul issues a personal message and a final blessing . He sends Tychicus , his coworker , to carry the Letter personally to the addressees and to be his surrogate . He then offers final greetings . The fact that he does not give any personal references such as can be found in his Letters seems to indicate that the Letter was a circular one , not sent to the Ephesians alone .

NCB	Philippians	1	3	I give thanks to my God every time I think of you .
NCB	Philippians	1	4	I always pray for you , interceding for you with joy
NCB	Philippians	1	5	because of your sharing in the gospel from the first day until now .
NCB	Philippians	1	6	I am confident of this : that the one who began a good work in you will bring it to completion on the day of Christ Jesus . [ c ]
NCB	Philippians	1	7	It is only right for me to feel this way toward you , because I hold you in my heart , for you have all shared with me in God ’ s grace , both during my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel .
NCB	Philippians	1	8	Indeed , God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus .
NCB	Philippians	1	9	And for this I pray : that your love may increase ever more and more in knowledge and full insight
NCB	Philippians	1	10	to enable you to discover what is really important , so that on the day of Christ you may be pure and blameless ,
NCB	Philippians	1	11	filled with the fruits of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ for the glory and praise of God . News and Instructions
NCB	Philippians	1	12	To Live Is Christ . [ d ] Brethren , I want you to know that what has happened to me has actually helped spread the gospel ,
NCB	Philippians	1	13	for my imprisonment has become known not only throughout the praetorium [ e ] but to everyone else as well .
NCB	Philippians	1	14	And the majority of the brethren having taken encouragement in the Lord from my imprisonment , dare more than ever to proclaim the word without fear .
NCB	Philippians	1	15	It is true that some are proclaiming Christ out of envy and rivalry , but others are doing so with goodwill .
NCB	Philippians	1	16	These latter ones do so out of love , aware that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel .
NCB	Philippians	1	17	The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition , not in sincerity , but in an effort to increase my suffering while I am in chains .
NCB	Philippians	1	18	But what does it matter , as long as in every way , with false motives or true , that Christ is proclaimed ? And in that I rejoice . Yes , and I will continue to rejoice ,
NCB	Philippians	1	19	for I know that through your prayers and with the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will result in deliverance for me .
NCB	Philippians	1	20	It is my firm expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in any way , but will act with complete fearlessness , now as always , so that Christ will be exalted in my body , whether by my life or by my death .
NCB	Philippians	1	21	For to me , to live is Christ and to die is gain . [ f ]
NCB	Philippians	1	22	But if I continue living in the body , that will mean fruitful work for me . Hence , I do not know which I should choose .
NCB	Philippians	1	23	I am pulled in opposite directions . My desire is to depart and to be with Christ , for that is far better ,
NCB	Philippians	1	24	but , it is a more urgent need for you that I remain in the body .
NCB	Philippians	1	25	Since I am convinced of this , I know that I shall remain and continue with all of you to ensure your progress and joy in the faith .
NCB	Philippians	1	26	Thus , you will rebound with joy in Christ Jesus when I return to be with you once again .
NCB	Philippians	1	27	Striving and Suffering for Christ . [ g ] Only live in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ . Then , whether I come and see you or simply hear news of you from a distance , I will know that you are standing firm and united in spirit , striving together for the faith of the gospel ,
NCB	Philippians	1	28	and being in no way intimidated by those who oppose you . This will be a clear sign to them of their forthcoming destruction as well as of your salvation . All of this is in accord with God ’ s design .

Their conduct , their plans , and their testimony are the authentic expression of this in their life . Using the religious language of the time , Paul regards his role as apostle and the surrender of his life as an offering and sacrifice , a true worship of God ( see Rom 1:9 ; 15:16 ) . - Philippians 2:12 Fear and trembling : an expression common in the Old Testament to indicate awe and devotion in God ’ s service ( see Ex 15:16 ; Jud 2:28 ; Ps 2:11 ; Isa 19:16 ) . - Philippians 2:19 Paul announces to the Philippians that he is sending them his most trusted coworker—Timothy , whom they already know ( see Acts 16:1-15 ) . He also hopes to visit them himself upon being released . And he will send Epaphroditus back to them when he is well . The last line ( v. 1a ) seems to be the beginning of a conclusion to the Letter .

NCB	Philippians	2	26	He has missed all of you and been greatly distressed because you heard that he was ill.
NCB	Philippians	2	27	And indeed he was dangerously ill and close to death . However , God had mercy on him—and not merely on him but on me as well , so that I would not have to endure one sorrow on top of another .

Footnotes - Philippians 2:1 For those who live by faith , united to Christ and the Holy Spirit , communion is the most precious of goods . It demands a complete turnaround extending to true humility . This means a generous abnegation that makes one prefer the interests of others rather than one ’ s own . Paul presses ahead on this subject and suddenly , gripped by the shining example of Christ , he then chants the hymn of the incredible abasements of God . - Philippians 2:6 The full breadth of the mystery of Christ is expressed in this hymn , which was either written by Paul himself or perhaps taken from the Liturgy of another community . The mystery is celebrated in two of its major aspects : descent and return , which form a curve whose two ends meet . During his stay on earth , Jesus was deprived of the glory that belonged to him , so that he might receive it again from the Father as a reward for his supreme sacrifice . He descended into the ultimate depths of abasement ; then the movement was reversed : the Father glorified him , made the universe subject to him , and gave him the supreme prerogative , the regal and Divine title of “ Lord. ” In the background here , Paul was thinking of the pride shown by created beings who want to be equal to God ( the desire of Adam ) ; he contrasts with this the self-giving and self-denial of Christ . But the hymn reminds us even more clearly of the songs of the Servant of God ( especially Isa
NCB	Philippians	2	53	) , which echoed strongly in the preaching of Jesus and in the teaching and Liturgy of the very early Church . It is the whole mystery of the incarnate Son of God that Paul here chants with such clarity and depth : his preexistence , his abasement , and his exaltation . And the Apostle does so in order to exhort some Christians to live the demands of their Baptism ! - Philippians 2:7 He emptied himself : this means , not that Jesus ceased to be equal to God , but rather that in his humanity he stripped himself of the Divine glory , manifesting this only at the Transfiguration ( Mt 17:1-8 ) , and subsequently received it again from the Father ( v.

NCB	Philippians	3	10	All I want is to come to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and to share in his sufferings by becoming conformed to his death ,

NCB	Philippians	3	14	I press on toward the finishing line to win the heavenly prize to which God has called me in Christ Jesus .
NCB	Philippians	3	15	Those of us who are mature should adopt this same attitude . If on any matter you have a different point of view , this too God will make clear to you .

NCB	Philippians	3	19	Their end is destruction . Their god is their stomach . Their glory is in their shame . Their minds are set on earthly things .
NCB	Philippians	3	20	But our citizenship is in heaven , [ i ] and from there we await our Savior , the Lord Jesus Christ .
NCB	Philippians	3	21	He will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be conformed to his glorified body by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to himself . Footnotes - Philippians 3:1 In a Letter that seemed to be coming to an end , a new subject is introduced . Paul is opposing the Jews or Jewish Christians who regard the practice of certain rites as indispensable , notably circumcision , even for those who believe in Christ . Christianity is total union with Christ in the greatest spiritual freedom . It can not consist—like Judaism—in meticulous practices that lead to formalism . There is no salvation except in Jesus Christ , as the Letters to the Romans and to the Galatians demonstrate at length . Anything else is a human practice that pertains to the order of the flesh . If the word “ circumcision ” must be used , it can refer only to the circumcision of the heart ; if there is need to speak of worship , it can only be a spiritual worship . Christ has now become the sole focus of Paul ’ s interest ; his entire life will be dedicated to knowing Christ , the Lord and Savior of the world , and making him known to others . - Philippians 3:2 Dogs : this is the name given to Gentiles by Jews ( see Mt 15:26 ) ; here it is applied ironically to the Judaizers ( see Gal 5:12 ) . Those who mutilate the flesh : i.e. , the Judaizers who insist that the Gentile Christians must agree to submit to circumcision ( see Gal 5:12 ) . - Philippians 3:3 We are the circumcision : Christians are the true People of God and offspring of Abraham ( see Gal 3:7 ,
NCB	Philippians	3	29	; 6:15 ) . - Philippians 3:4 Paul had everything needed to forge for himself a brilliant career in Judaism , and he dreamed about it . He was a Jew of the most elite tribe and the most rigorous sect as well as a zealous advocate and defender of his religion . His encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus—a Jesus who identified himself totally with his followers and who loved him unconditionally—turned everything upside down for Paul . Henceforth , Christ becomes his sole interest . His very existence will be the knowledge of the Lord Jesus , that is , communion in his Paschal Mystery of dying and rising to new life , and participation in his work for the salvation of the world . One thing is evident for Paul : human beings can become fully realized only by giving themselves to Christ without reservation . - Philippians 3:5 The tribe of Benjamin was descended from the one son of Jacob who was born in Palestine ( Gen 35:16f ) , and it had always been faithful to the Davidic dynasty . The Jerusalem temple was in the territory of Benjamin . - Philippians 3:12 Grasped by Christ on the road to Damascus , Paul strains toward him with his whole being , and this aim of his life energizes all his forces . The Christian life is inner growth , deepening , and development , and Paul loves to describe it as a course to be run . Once anyone has begun the race , there can not be any stopping : “ If you say ‘ Enough , ’ you are already dead ” ( St. Augustine ) . Those who have already “ reached perfection ” are Christians whose faith can be termed “ mature. ” - Philippians 3:17 Paul stresses that the Christian life is carried along by a profound hope . We turn that hope away from its goal when we fix its fulfillment in the realities of earth and even more when we polarize it on failed religious practices . Paul was probably thinking of the Jewish dietary customs and the circumcision that some Jewish-Christian preachers wanted to impose on new communities . - Philippians 3:17 Join in imitating me : since Paul ’ s wholehearted imitation of Christ is well known to his readers (

NCB	Philippians	4	12	I know how to live with little , and I know how to live with plenty . In any and all circumstances , I have learned the secret of being well fed and of going hungry , of having plenty and of being in need .

Footnotes - Philippians 4:2 Lines of communication are established in all the new communities , and women play an important role in their life and apostolate . Doubtless , members at times experience the difficulty of living and working together , as is the case between Euodia and Syntyche . Paul is confident that these two good women will be reconciled to one another . Clement : it is possible , but not certain , that this is Clement , the first Roman Pope . Book of life : an image current at the time to evoke the collectivity of the saved ( see Ex 32:32 ; Ps 69:29 ; Isa 4:3 ; Dan 12:1 ; Rev 3:5 ) . - Philippians 4:4 Joy is the great secret of Christians , the sign that faith has triumphed over all fears , the normal fruit of a spiritual life that progresses . The peace of God is more profound than any kind of peace that the human spirit can attain solely by its own effort . - Philippians 4:8 Radically detached from earthly goods , a purified heart is able to recognize the gifts of Christ through all human values . In these verses , Etienne Gilson saw “ the eternal charter of Christian humanism. ” - Philippians 4:10 Even when in need , Paul did not want to depend on the communities for material help ( see
NCB	Philippians	4	25	) .
NCB	Colossians	1	1	Cor 15:22-28 ; Phil 3:21 ) : the risen Christ is the center in whom two worlds are united , the Divine and the created . - Colossians 1:19 All fullness ( plêrôma ) : the fullness of deity ( see Col 2:9 ) or , better , the universe full of the creative and redemptive presence of God . According to Paul , the risen Christ rules the whole of creation , what has been raised from sinfulness to salvation . - Colossians 1:21 By dying on the cross , Christ has accomplished the reconciliation of all human beings . The Gospel changes their condition before God , provided that they accept it with faith . Paul rejoices in suffering to announce such a message , for he knows that the ordeal of a missionary is united with the Passion of Christ and contributes to the life and growth of the Church . He is captivated by the “ mystery ” of God . This term frequently means , depending on the context , Christ as prophesied , Christ who has come into this world , Christ continuing his work in the Church , Christ in his triumphal return . Here , in this grand perspective of unity , Paul focuses his attention on the present aspect of the mystery . Today , Jews and Gentiles are admitted into the same inheritance , they are members of the same body , and they benefit from the same promise ; today , even the multitudes of the Gentiles whom Israel regarded as excluded from the Covenant are called to the embrace of the Church . This is the wonderful mystery that the Apostle is charged to reveal . - Colossians 1:24 For the sake of his body , the Church : nothing is lacking in the sufferings of Christ , but believers who form a single reality with him ( his body ) prolong and complete his Paschal Mystery of Death and Resurrection by their trials and sufferings . - Colossians 1:27 Christ dwells in us when we are regenerated ( see Eph 3:17 ) . We partake of the divine nature by feeding on him ( Jn 6:56 ) and by having his word abide in us , and we grow in grace and bear fruit as we abide in him ( Jn 15:5f ) .
NCB	Colossians	1	2	Cor 4:4 ; Phil 2:6 ; Heb 1:3 ) . Christ is before all and above all ; whether we consider the universe or the History of Salvation , he is both the reason for being and the explanation of everything in them . If we seek the origin of , the rationale for , or the end of creation , he is the one we must name . All the heavenly forces and hierarchies so prized in certain Jewish or Christian circles in Colossae—in a word , everything that claims to rule the universe—are subject to him as the Creator . He alone is Lord of the world . He alone is the power giving life to the Church , that is , his Body . He alone is the Mediator who reconciles all beings with one another and with God . We experience a universe disordered by sin ; it is re-created and transformed in him . Hence , for the Christian , history has a movement and a meaning : it is oriented toward Christ , directed by him , and consummated in him . Paul wants to enunciate a hope that is infinitely more than merely human , a hope founded in faith ( see Rom 8:19-22 ;
NCB	Colossians	1	3	In all our prayers for you we always give thanks to God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,

Footnotes - Colossians 1:2 Saints : Christians are called saints because through Baptism they have been consecrated to God and are called to live accordingly . - Colossians 1:3 The power of the Gospel to live and spread is extraordinary ; it is God ’ s grace and action among human beings . In the vitality of a young Church , Paul recognizes this work of the Lord , and he prays that it will develop in all its richness . Thanksgiving and prayer succeed each other in this introduction and indicate the principal features of an authentic Christian life : to accept the truth of the Gospel ; to grow in faith , love , and hope ; and to know God more in order to be more faithful in the concrete . Nonetheless , the initiative comes from the Lord . It is he who changes our life ; it is he who frees us from the bondage of sin and leads us into a new world , the kingdom of Christ . Now he is extending to all the Gentiles the salvation formerly reserved for Israel— “ the inheritance of the saints. ” Such a text gives us the echo of what might have been the mystique of Baptism and the joy of the Christian in the early Church . - Colossians 1:5 This verse refers to the three theological virtues of faith , hope , and love , which also appear in Rom 5:2-5 ;

NCB	Colossians	2	11	miles away from Colossae ; the Letter was to be read there , too ( Col 4:16 ) . - Colossians 2:6 Paul states that human laws , even the Law of Moses , could forbid sin but not overcome it ; they drive human beings to sin and are like a sentence of death . We could imagine all sorts of hidden forces that might rule the world , but they can only add to the alienation of humans . Christ has liberated believers from this tyranny of observances and myths . In his Resurrection , he is the sole master through whom human beings are raised , and all the imaginable forces are subjected to him . For Christians , the conception of the world and life has changed ; having been baptized , they share in the very life of God . This is a much more profound turnaround than the ancient circumcision . Why then do the Colossians insist on seeking salvation in material observances , human theories , and myths ? - Colossians 2:8 Human tradition : literally , “ philosophy , ” a word that occurs only here in the New Testament . In this context , it refers not to systematic thought but to religious speculations . - Colossians 2:9 The entire fullness of deity dwells in bodily form : i.e. , in the risen and glorified body of Christ . - Colossians 2:14 Record against us : the reference is perhaps to the Mosaic Law . The latter pointed out the way of the commandments but did not give the power to observe ; as a result , it became the source of indictment . - Colossians 2:16 Certain Colossian Christians of Jewish extraction minutely observed the customs of the Jewish religion , others were partial to visions and revelations , and still others gave themselves over to ascetical practices . All of them acted as if their method was necessary for salvation . But wasn ’ t it Christ who saved them and who enabled his Church to live as a new seed in the world ? To believe is to be set free and to dedicate oneself entirely to the Lord . What can human rites , exercises , usages , and theories do in this respect ? - Colossians 2:16 Observance of Festivals , New Moons , or Sabbaths : observances that were in vogue on a yearly , monthly , or weekly basis . These were usually reckoned according to heavenly bodies , sun , moon , and stars ( see Col 2:8 ) .

Paul does not reverse this social structure . However , neither is he content simply to enumerate the rights of husbands , parents , and masters so as to oppose them with the duties of wives , children , and slaves . He stresses a reciprocity of duties and preaches a Christian attachment— “ in the Lord ” —an appeal to conscience . He does not call upon slaves to revolt but gives them another way to look upon themselves—the fact that they belong to the Lord takes precedence over their dependence on their human masters . And in a near contradiction of terms , slaves are regarded as heirs of the Lord . This short list of precepts of family morality was developed at length in the Letter to the Ephesians ( 5:21—6:9 ) .

Footnotes - Colossians 3:1 It is not a question here of having contempt for earthly realities but of a new movement by which Christians must let themselves be grasped . Seemingly , Baptism has changed nothing for them , but in reality they live henceforth united to Christ in an even more mysterious manner . They have entered the world of the Resurrection . It is a certitude that transforms the idea that they have of their existence . At the same time , it is an impatient longing for the return of the Lord , when this change in their lives will be made complete . - Colossians 3:5 This is a Christian endeavor , something that expresses the reality of life and the transformation of Baptism , and something that enables believers to become each day a bit more what they , in fact , are , i.e. , living members of the risen Christ . Morality is then no longer a list of recommended reactions but a thrust that opposes sin and degradation , a growth in an ever more profound affinity with the Lord . United with Christ , Christians are new persons who no longer identify themselves by cultural references or by ethical and religious differences . Union with Christ basically destroys all divisions ( see Gal 3:28 ) . - Colossians 3:5 See Rom 1:29-31 and Gal 5:19-21 for other lists of vices . - Colossians 3:11 Scythian : the Scythians lived on the steppes of Asia and were regarded as barbarians par excellence . - Colossians 3:12 The Church is a community of persons bound together by love to give testimony to love .

Undoubtedly , magicians practiced their wiles at Ephesus ; in fact , according to Jewish legend , Jannes and Jambres were leading sorcerers who opposed Moses before Pharaoh ( see Ex 7:8ff ) . Like Paul , everyone who announces the Gospel must accept persecution ( see Mt 5:10-11 ; 10:22 ; Jn 15:19-20 ; Acts 13:1—14:28 ) . It is a call for strength and firmness . The important thing for the envoy of God and the Church is to remain faithful to the word of God as reported in Scripture .

Nor did he simply reveal to the human author the contents of the Book and the way in which this should be expressed . Rather , the human author is a living instrument endowed with reason who under the divine impulse brings his faculties and powers into play in such a way that all can easily gather from the Book produced by his work his distinctive genius and his individual characteristics and features . In other words , the sacred author , like every author , makes use of all his faculties—intellect , imagination , and will—to consign to writing whatever God wanted written , and no more . By virtue of the divine condescension , things are presented to us in the Bible in a manner that is in common use among human beings . For as the substantial Word of God made himself like human beings in all things except sin ( see Heb 4:15 ) , so God ’ s words , spoken by human tongues , have taken on all the qualities of human language except error .

The important thing , Jesus had declared ( see Mk 7:1-23 ) , was not to wash one ’ s hands or to forbid foods but to give oneself to God with an upright and sincere heart ( see Mt 5:8 ) .

It is the sign that such a person is marked by the idea of God ’ s goodness .

Hence , for Philemon to treat Onesimus solely as a runaway slave would be entirely unfitting with his Christian witness . - Philemon 1:16 As a man : literally “ in the flesh. ” - Philemon 1:17 Paul is doing the same thing for Onesimus with Philemon that Christ did for us with God the Father . - Philemon 1:20 Benefit : the Greek for this word is another play on the name Onesimus : what Paul wishes to get out of the master is Onesimus himself ; he wants to be able to make use of the Useful One . - Philemon 1:21 The Apostle is confident not only that his request will be more than fully granted but also that he will soon have the joy of being reunited with Philemon .

He plays with the meaning of the name “ Onesimus , ” which is “ useful , ” and with the meaning of another Greek word , chrestos , which is part of achrestos , the word for “ useless , ” and euchrestos , the word for “ useful. ” In the background is the point that chrestos sounds like Christos , which means “ Christ. ” Paul also takes the responsibility to relieve any financial burden that Philemon may have incurred in the affair , but he ends up saying that it is Philemon who is more indebted to the Apostle himself ! Indeed , the slave ’ s flight may turn out to be a grace—it offers Philemon the chance to acknowledge him as a “ brother ” in Christ . - Philemon 1:10 My child : Paul became a father to Onesimus by converting him ( see

These include Apphia , thought to be his wife , and Archippus , thought to be his son , who is also a pastor like Paul ( “ fellow soldier [ of Christ ] ” ) .

Footnotes - Hebrews 1:1 From the opening words to the final “ Amen ” ( Heb 13:21 ) , readers are to keep their gaze fixed on Christ . In this magisterial sentence , “ God . . . has spoken to us through his Son ” ( Heb 1:2 ) , which is one of the most tightly packed and beautiful of the entire New Testament , the essence of the Letter is expressed . God has spoken definitively in Christ , who is his real , living Word . Everything that can be said about the plan of God is made fully real in Christ . Using expressions taken from Alexandrian thought , the author says that the Son , born of the Father , is in every respect equal to him ; the glorified Christ is far superior to the world of the angels , and he gives existence and salvation to every creature . Thus , seven great theological themes are set forth : (
NCB	Hebrews	1	5	No one is like him in intimacy with God , neither is anyone like him in proximity to humans . The link between heaven and earth is established in his very Person . It is the principal aim of the Letter to the Hebrews to hold to these two aspects of Christ : he is united through and through with God , and he is completely one with human beings . In this first part of the Letter , he is presented as Son of God and brother to human beings . - Hebrews 1:5 In Christ God has spoken in a definitive way ( Heb 1:2 ) , and the author sees this truth already proclaimed in the Old Testament . He cites a series of passages , almost all of which were regarded in the Jewish tradition as announcements of the Messiah . What are angels ? Merely subordinates , mediators , and messengers ever being replaced . But the Son is the Firstborn . This is the title of honor reserved for Christ that includes a priority over creatures ( see Col 1:15 ) . He receives adoration , is enthroned , and partakes unceasingly in the status of God . - Hebrews 1:5 I will be his Father , /and he will be my Son : before the coming of Christ , this text from

NCB	Hebrews	2	4	God also testified to it by signs and wonders and various miracles , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will . Christ Our Brother . [ b ]
NCB	Hebrews	2	5	For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come , about which we are speaking .
NCB	Hebrews	2	6	But someone has offered this testimony somewhere : “ What is man that you are mindful of him , or the son of man that you care for him ?
NCB	Hebrews	2	7	You made him a little lower than the angels , yet crowned him with glory and honor
NCB	Hebrews	2	8	and put everything under his feet. ” Now in putting everything under his feet , he left nothing that is not subject to his control . Right now we do not yet see everything under his feet .
NCB	Hebrews	2	9	However , we do see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels , now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death , so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone .
NCB	Hebrews	2	10	In bringing many sons to glory , it was completely fitting that he , for whom and through whom everything exists , should make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
NCB	Hebrews	2	11	Both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all proceed from one Father . That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
NCB	Hebrews	2	12	saying , “ I will proclaim your name to my brethren ; [ c ] in the midst of the assembly I will praise you. ”
NCB	Hebrews	2	13	And again , “ I will put my trust in him. ” And again , “ Here I am , together with the children God has given me. ”
NCB	Hebrews	2	14	Therefore , since the children are all made of flesh and blood , [ d ] Jesus likewise shared in the same flesh and blood , so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death—that is , the devil—
NCB	Hebrews	2	15	and set free those who throughout their lives had been held in slavery by the fear of death .
NCB	Hebrews	2	16	For clearly he did not come to help angels but rather he came to help the descendants of Abraham .
NCB	Hebrews	2	17	) and capable of being its guarantor in heaven . The principal theme of the Letter is here announced . - Hebrews 2:12 I will proclaim your name to my brethren : a quotation from Ps 22:23 , a psalm that describes the sufferings of the Servant of God . The key phrase is “ my brethren ” ( i.e. , the Septuagint text ; the Hebrew has “ the community ” ) , which is spoken by the triumphant Messiah . - Hebrews 2:14 Flesh and blood : i.e. , the human condition .
NCB	Hebrews	2	18	Because he himself was tested by suffering , he is able to help those who are being tested . Footnotes - Hebrews 2:1 The Law of Sinai , which according to rabbinic tradition was communicated by angels , binds humanity to live in a certain way . Much greater is the authority of the voice of Christ transmitted to the Church by the Apostles with the evident guarantee of the Spirit ( see Mt 10:1 ; Mk 16:20 ; Acts 1:8 ) . This is the first of five warnings scattered throughout the Letter ( the other four are : Heb 3:7—4:13 ; 5:11—6:12 ; 10:19-39 ; and 12:4-29 ) . - Hebrews 2:5 The Son of God , who became a human being and was crucified , is Lord of the universe ( see Phil 2:6-11 ) ; all human beings have been brought into solidarity with him . To throw light on this destiny of Christ , the author gives a free interpretation of Ps 8:5-7 . Angels and institutions are incapable of establishing a bond between God and humanity ; in Christ humanity is given one of its own , but one who is the true high priest ( v.
NCB	Hebrews	3	3	However , he is deserving of a greater glory than Moses , just as the builder of a house is more honored than the house itself .
NCB	Hebrews	3	1	Cor 10:1-11 ) . Ps
NCB	Hebrews	3	2	He was faithful to the one who appointed him , just as Moses was faithful in God ’ s household .
NCB	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is built by someone , but the builder of all is God .
NCB	Hebrews	3	5	Now Moses was faithful as a servant in God ’ s household , testifying to the things that would later be revealed ,
NCB	Hebrews	3	6	whereas Christ was faithful as a son watching over his house . And we are that house if we hold firm to our confidence and take pride in our hope . The “ Today ” of God . [ c ]
NCB	Hebrews	3	7	Therefore , as the Holy Spirit says , “ Today , if you hear his voice ,
NCB	Hebrews	3	8	harden not your hearts as at the rebellion , in the day of testing in the desert ,
NCB	Hebrews	3	9	where your ancestors tried me and tested me though they had seen what I could do
NCB	Hebrews	3	10	for forty years . As a result I became angered with that generation , and I said , ‘ Their hearts have always gone astray , and they do not know my ways. ’
NCB	Hebrews	3	11	Therefore , I swore in my anger , ‘ They will never enter into my rest. ’ ”
NCB	Hebrews	3	12	Take care , brethren , that none of you will ever have an evil and unbelieving heart that will cause you to forsake the living God .
NCB	Hebrews	3	13	Rather , encourage each other every day , as long as it is today , so that none of you will become hardened by the deceitfulness of sin .
NCB	Hebrews	3	14	For we will become partners with Christ only if we maintain firmly until the end the confidence we originally had ,
NCB	Hebrews	3	15	as it is said , “ Today , if you hear his voice , harden not your hearts as at the rebellion. ”
NCB	Hebrews	3	16	Who were those who heard and yet rebelled ? Were they not all those whom Moses had led out of Egypt ?
NCB	Hebrews	3	17	And with whom was he angered for forty years ? Was it not with those who had sinned and whose corpses lay in the wilderness ?
NCB	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did he swear that they would never enter into his rest , if not to those who disobeyed ?
NCB	Hebrews	3	19	So we see clearly that they were unable to enter because of their refusal to believe . Footnotes - Hebrews 3:1 The Covenant with Israel was entered into in the wilderness . Two great figures stood out : Moses and Aaron—the two mediators of the Law and sacrifice , of authority and worship . But when the work of Christ becomes known , all of that proves to have been provisional . And to speak of Christ the author develops two ideas : fidelity to God and solidarity or sympathy with humans . In between these two developments he inserts a long exhortation to serious Christians . - Hebrews 3:1 The fidelity of Jesus is greater than that of Moses . Both were “ apostles , ” sent by God to the people , and “ priests , ” i.e. , representatives of the people before God . But Moses acted in the world as a servant who carries out a limited mandate . Christ accomplishes his work personally , in his own name , like a Son . This work belongs to him ; and it is the community of believers that he establishes in the world of God . - Hebrews 3:7 Like Israel of the Exodus , the Church is on the march , on earth , certain of the promise of God but exposed to temptation . Since the Jewish people love to cling to the great epoch in the wilderness , the author invites them to profit from the lesson of that time—which is one of fidelity—offering them a commentary on Ps
NCB	Hebrews	3	95	, which at that period was attributed to David , was written long after the Exile , when the perspective was no longer the conquest of Canaan , which had been accomplished by Joshua . The promise to enter into the rest of God has not become something distant : it is deeply involved with the fulfillment of creation , with sharing today in the divine life by following Christ along the way he has opened up ( Heb 4:14 ) .
NCB	Hebrews	4	4	For somewhere he says in reference to the seventh day , “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works. ”
NCB	Hebrews	4	1	Pet 1:23 ) . - Hebrews 4:14 Trait by trait , the portrait of the high priest is developed . It is fully verified only in Christ ; moreover , we are now beyond the priesthood of Aaron and the earthly liturgy . Christ has set free his own ; the Risen One who now lives forever expresses that compassion for humans to which he bore witness in his Passion . This priest is more one with human beings than Aaron was . He is established by God to perform more than a passing service for them . As Son and according to the order of Melchizedek ( who will be spoken about later ) , he is engaged with all his person in his supplication and his sacrifice . The Passion is the most solemn prayer of intercession , the greatest act of obedience at the heart of humanity .
NCB	Hebrews	4	2	and Ps 95:11 ) . The third “ rest ” was the one Jesus took upon entering the eternal sphere after completing the work of Redemption ( see Eph 1:20 ; 2:6 ; 4:8 ) . These “ rests ” foreshadow the ultimate “ rest ” that awaits all Christians ( v.
NCB	Hebrews	4	3	For we who have faith enter into that rest , just as God has said : “ Therefore , I swore in my anger , ‘ They will never enter into my rest. ’ ” Yet God ’ s work had been finished at the beginning of the world .
NCB	Hebrews	4	5	And in this passage it says , “ They will never enter into my rest. ”
NCB	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing , therefore , that some will enter into that rest , and since those who first had received the good news failed to enter because of their refusal to believe ,
NCB	Hebrews	4	7	God once more set a day— “ today ” —when long afterward he spoke through David , as already quoted : “ Today , if you hear his voice , harden not your hearts. ”
NCB	Hebrews	4	8	Now if Joshua had given them rest , God would not have spoken afterward of another day .
NCB	Hebrews	4	9	Therefore , a Sabbath rest still remains for the people of God ,
NCB	Hebrews	4	10	since those who enter into God ’ s rest also cease from their own labors as God did from his .
NCB	Hebrews	4	11	) , provided they have a living faith in the person and work of Jesus . - Hebrews 4:12 The word of God is living and effective . It pierces into the most inner part of believers who open themselves completely to it . This dynamic word of God appears in both the Old and the New Testament ( see Pss 107:20 ; 147:18 ; Isa 40:8 ; 55:11 ; Gal 3:8 ; Eph 5:26 ; Jas 1:18 ;
NCB	Hebrews	4	12	The Word of God Is Living . [ b ] Indeed , the word of God is living and active . Sharper than any two-edged sword , it pierces to the point where it divides soul and spirit , joints and marrow ; it judges the thoughts and the intentions of the heart .
NCB	Hebrews	4	13	Nothing in creation is hidden from his sight . Everything is uncovered and exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must all render an account .
NCB	Hebrews	4	14	A Compassionate High Priest . [ c ] Therefore , since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast to our profession of faith .
NCB	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who has been tested in every respect as we are , but without sinning .
NCB	Hebrews	4	16	Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace when we are in need of help . Footnotes - Hebrews 4:1 The first “ rest ” in Scripture was the one that God took on the seventh day of creation ( see Gen 2:3 ) . The second “ rest ” was the one God promised to the Israelites in Canaan , but which they were not allowed to enter because of their lack of faith ( see v.
NCB	Hebrews	5	5	Even Christ did not confer upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest . Rather , he was appointed by the one who said to him : “ You are my Son ; this day I have begotten you. ”
NCB	Hebrews	5	1	Every high priest is taken from among men to represent them in their dealings with God , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins . [ a ]
NCB	Hebrews	5	2	Cor 8:4 ; 9:1-15 ) .
NCB	Hebrews	5	3	And as a result of this , he must make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people .
NCB	Hebrews	5	4	Moreover , one does not assume this position of honor on his own initiative , but only when called by God , just as Aaron was .
NCB	Hebrews	5	6	And he says in another place : “ You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek. ”
NCB	Hebrews	5	7	During the course of his earthly life , Jesus offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who had the power to save him from death , and he was heard because of his godly fear .
NCB	Hebrews	5	8	Although he was a Son , he learned obedience through his sufferings ,
NCB	Hebrews	5	9	and when he had been made perfect , he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him ,
NCB	Hebrews	5	10	and he was designated a high priest by God according to the order of Melchizedek . Christ , the One True Priest [ b ] Deepen the Christian Life . [ c ] We have much to say about this subject , but it is difficult to explain because you have been slow in learning .
NCB	Hebrews	5	12	By this time you should have been teachers , yet you still need to have someone explain to you the basic elements of God ’ s words . You need milk , not solid food .
NCB	Hebrews	5	13	Anyone who lives on milk is still an infant and is ignorant of the word of righteousness .
NCB	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for adults whose faculties have been trained by practice to distinguish between good and evil . Footnotes - Hebrews 5:1 To offer gifts and sacrifices for sins : on the Day of Atonement ( which the author is here envisioning ) , atonement was made for the sins of the Israelites ( see Lev 16:34 ) . - Hebrews 5:11 This is the central part of the letter . Its themes center around a single great idea : Christ , “ high priest of the good things that have come ” ( Heb 9:11 ) , or “ that are to come. ” The vision starts with the past and with a reflection on all the religious situations already experienced , then leaves them and focuses on their fulfillment : the future of humanity with God , in and with Christ . Proofs are piled up to show that this new priesthood transcends all the ancient institutions , brings them to fulfillment , and renders them things of the past .
NCB	Hebrews	5	11	The word “ priest ” is taken here in the sense used by the Old Testament and by religions of the time : the man of worship , the man who represents his brothers and sisters in ritual actions that will enable them to be purified and have access to the divinity . Jesus Christ appears as the only one who is the presence of the forgiveness of God , the one who gives access to God , the representative of all that humanity expects from God . Every other priesthood and all other sacrifices are only a sketch , sign , shadow , prefiguration , and expectation . They are now surpassed . The ancient words and hopes are evoked to say more than they could have suggested without the faith in Christ . - Hebrews 5:11 The author warns his readers against regressing spiritually and morally . They must become “ perfect ” —what we would call “ adults ” or “ mature. ” That is , they must not be content with the rudiments of faith but must deepen their faith by reflection . Six basic teachings are enumerated and apostasy is condemned . Finally , a note of hope is given . A life marked by love can not be insignificant ; and this love has a concrete expression : the service of the saints ( Heb 6:10 ) , i.e. , the sustenance of the poor of the Jerusalem community ( see Rom 15:25-31 ;
NCB	Hebrews	6	6	) Eternal judgment : the lot of those who reject God . - Hebrews 6:4 The author asserts that repentance for apostates is impossible . However , he may be using hyperbole to impress on his readers that abandoning Christ is most serious . - Hebrews 6:13 In the beginning , before any law and any institution of worship , there were two immutable realities : God ’ s promise and his oath . There were also two figures : Abraham and Melchizedek . The author wishes to stress one solid point : God committed himself radically to the future and salvation of human beings , a future and a salvation that become realities forever through Christ—as the following chapters will explain . - Hebrews 6:19 The veil separated the two most sacred parts of the Jewish temple .
NCB	Hebrews	6	1	Tim 5:22 ;
NCB	Hebrews	6	2	Tim 1:6 ) , with healing the sick ( see Mk 6:5 ; 16:18 ; Lk 4:40 ; Acts 28:8 ) , and with bestowal of blessings ( see Mt 19:13-15 ) . (
NCB	Hebrews	6	3	) Instruction about baptisms : e.g. , Jewish initiation rites for proselytes , John the Baptist ’ s baptism , and the Baptism commanded by Jesus . (
NCB	Hebrews	6	4	) Laying on of hands : a rite connected with ordaining or commissioning ( see Acts 6:6 ; 13:3 ;
NCB	Hebrews	6	5	) Resurrection of the dead : the resurrection of all people in the end time ( see Jn 5:25-29 ) . (
NCB	Hebrews	6	7	When the soil drinks in the rain that repeatedly falls on it and produces a crop that is useful to those for whom it was cultivated , it receives a blessing from God .
NCB	Hebrews	6	8	However , if it brings forth thorns and thistles , it is worthless , and a curse hangs over it . It will end by being burned .
NCB	Hebrews	6	9	But , beloved , in spite of what we have just said , we are convinced that your status is far superior as you proceed to salvation .
NCB	Hebrews	6	10	For God would not be so unjust as to ignore your work and the love that you have shown for his name by the services you have rendered to the saints and still continue to render .
NCB	Hebrews	6	11	However , we desire that each one of you will show the same diligence until you have achieved the ultimate fulfillment of your hope .
NCB	Hebrews	6	12	We do not want you to allow yourselves to become sluggish ; rather , we want you to become imitators of those who through faith and patience are now heirs of the promises .
NCB	Hebrews	6	13	Cling Tightly to Hope . [ c ] When God made his promise to Abraham , since he had no one greater by whom to swear , he swore by himself ,
NCB	Hebrews	6	14	saying , “ I will surely bless you and multiply your descendants. ”
NCB	Hebrews	6	15	And so , after waiting patiently , he obtained the promise .
NCB	Hebrews	6	16	Human beings swear by someone greater than themselves , and the oath given as confirmation puts an end to all argument .
NCB	Hebrews	6	17	Likewise , when God desired to show even more clearly to the heirs of his promise the unalterable nature of his purpose , he confirmed it by an oath .
NCB	Hebrews	6	18	Therefore , by these two unchangeable acts in which it was impossible for God to lie , we who have taken refuge in his protection have been strongly encouraged to grasp firmly the hope that has been held out to us .
NCB	Hebrews	6	19	We have this hope as the anchor of the soul , a hope that enters the sanctuary behind the veil , [ d ]
NCB	Hebrews	6	20	where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf , having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek . Footnotes - Hebrews 6:1 Six basic teachings are mentioned . (
NCB	Hebrews	7	7	It is indisputable that a lesser person is blessed by one who is greater .
NCB	Hebrews	7	1	Jn 1:7 ) ; the right to be worshiped ( see Mt 8:2 ; Phil 2:10 ) .
NCB	Hebrews	7	2	Cor 5:21 ) ; eternity ( see Mic 5:2 ; Jn 1:1 ; 8:58 ; 17:5 ,
NCB	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , or mother , or genealogy , and without beginning of days or end of life , thus bearing a resemblance to the Son of God , he remains a priest forever .
NCB	Hebrews	7	4	) . The Letter to the Hebrews says that those passages foretell the priesthood of Christ . Yet the priesthood of Christ can not be measured by the same standard as the Jewish priesthood , because it renders the latter obsolete . - Hebrews 7:1 The figure of Melchizedek is full of symbols . His name means “ king of righteousness ” ; his reign was one of “ peace. ” Most unusually , the Bible gives us no chronological or genealogical information about him , naming neither his ancestors nor his descendants . His priesthood does not seem to be connected in any way with a hereditary line of priests , but only with his own person , as though it were something everlasting . And Abraham , to whom is given all the power to bless and the promises for Israel , receives a blessing from Melchizedek and offers him a tithe . All the more , then , does this priest stand above all the descendants of the Patriarch , and especially Levi , from whom descends all the Jewish priests whose standing the people acknowledge by paying them a tithe ( see Lev 27:30-33 ; Num 18:21f ) . In the person of Abraham , they all bowed down to the mysterious priesthood of Melchizedek , who prefigured Jesus . - Hebrews 7:11 Jesus Christ , foretold by the person of Melchizedek , does not have a place in the priestly genealogies that were set up after Moses ; his priesthood is based on the commitment of God himself , on the divine oath ( vv . 20-22 ) . He is the definitive mediator between God and humanity . - Hebrews 7:26 A first conclusion rises as a chant of freedom and a beautiful hymn to Christ . Perishable offerings are no longer anything but a symbol of self-giving already completed in reality : Christ alone can commit himself completely to God , become an offering , and in his very person be the representative of human beings before God . The Son who has been made perfect forever : Jesus , the Son , is God , and he shares the divine attributes , e.g. , holiness ( see v.
NCB	Hebrews	7	5	The descendants of Levi who succeed to the priestly office are required by the Law to collect tithes from the people , that is , from their fellow countrymen , although they too are descended from Abraham .
NCB	Hebrews	7	6	However , Melchizedek , who was not of the same ancestry , received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises .
NCB	Hebrews	7	8	In the one case , it is ordinary mortal men who receive tithes ; in the other , the recipient is one of whom it is attested that he is alive .
NCB	Hebrews	7	9	One could even say that Levi himself , who receives tithes , actually paid tithes through Abraham ,
NCB	Hebrews	7	10	; Jn 1:3 ;
NCB	Hebrews	7	11	Another High Priest according to the Order of Melchizedek . [ c ] If perfection was therefore achieved through the Levitical priesthood , on the basis of which the Law was given to the people , what need would there have been for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek rather than one according to the order of Aaron ?
NCB	Hebrews	7	12	For when there is any change in the priesthood , there must also be a change in the Law .
NCB	Hebrews	7	13	Now the one about whom these things were said belonged to a different tribe , from which no one has ever served at the altar .
NCB	Hebrews	7	14	For it is clear that our Lord was descended from Judah , a tribe about which Moses said nothing in regard to priests .
NCB	Hebrews	7	15	This becomes even more obvious now that another priest has arisen , one like Melchizedek ,
NCB	Hebrews	7	16	who was one not through a legal requirement concerning physical descent , but by the power of an indestructible life .
NCB	Hebrews	7	17	For it is attested of him : “ You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek. ”
NCB	Hebrews	7	18	The earlier commandment is abrogated because of its weakness and ineffectiveness ,
NCB	Hebrews	7	19	since the Law brought nothing to perfection . On the other hand , a better hope is introduced through which we draw nearer to God .
NCB	Hebrews	7	20	This was confirmed by an oath . When others became priests , no oath was required ,
NCB	Hebrews	7	21	but this one became a priest with the swearing of an oath by the one who said to him , “ The Lord has sworn , and he will not repent : ‘ You are a priest forever. ’ ”
NCB	Hebrews	7	22	Accordingly , Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant .
NCB	Hebrews	7	23	Furthermore , the former priests were many in number , because they were prevented by death from remaining in office .
NCB	Hebrews	7	24	; Col 1:17 ) ; omnipotence ( see Heb 1:3 ; Mt 28:18 ; Rev 1:8 ) ; omniscience ( see Mt 9:4 ; Jn 6:64 ; 16:30 ; Col 2:3 ) ; immutability ( see Heb 1:11f ; 13:8 ) ; omnipresence ( see Mt 28:20 ; Jn 3:13 ; Eph 1:23 ) ; creative power ( see Heb 1:8 ,
NCB	Hebrews	7	25	Therefore , he has the full power to save those who approach God through him , since he lives forever to intercede for them .
NCB	Hebrews	7	26	; Jn 8:46 ;
NCB	Hebrews	7	27	Unlike the other high priests , he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day , first for his own sins and then for those of the people . He accomplished this once for all when he offered himself .
NCB	Hebrews	7	28	The Law appoints as high priests those who are subject to weakness , but the word of the oath , which came later than the Law , appointed the Son who has been made perfect forever . Footnotes - Hebrews 7:1 A mysterious figure made his appearance in the story of Abraham : Melchizedek ( see Gen 14:17-20 ) , and Ps 110—which held a special place in Israel ’ s meditation on the Messiah—speaks of a mysterious priesthood of the kind exercised by Melchizedek ( v.
NCB	Hebrews	8	8	[ e ] However , God finds fault with his people , and he says , “ Behold , the days are coming , says the Lord , when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah .
NCB	Hebrews	8	1	) God ’ s laws are inner principles ( v. 10a ) enabling his people to carry out his will ( see Ezek 36:26f ; Rom 8:2-4 ) . (
NCB	Hebrews	8	2	) God and his people enjoy an intimate fellowship ( v. 10b ) . (
NCB	Hebrews	8	3	) There will nevermore be sinful ignorance of God ( v.
NCB	Hebrews	8	4	) Forgiveness of sins will last forever ( v.
NCB	Hebrews	8	5	although the sanctuary in which they offer worship is only a shadow and a reflection of the heavenly one . This is the reason why , when Moses was about to erect the tabernacle , he was warned , “ See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain. ” Another Covenant . [ d ]
NCB	Hebrews	8	6	But Jesus has now received a ministry that is far superior , for he is the mediator of a far better covenant that has been established on better promises .
NCB	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , there would have been no necessity to establish a second one to replace it .
NCB	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt . For they did not remain faithful to my covenant , and therefore I abandoned them , says the Lord .
NCB	Hebrews	8	10	) . - Hebrews 8:8 The New Covenant is superior to the old because of the following : (
NCB	Hebrews	8	11	) . (
NCB	Hebrews	8	12	) .
NCB	Hebrews	8	13	By calling this covenant “ new , ” he has made the first one obsolete . And anything that is obsolete and aging will shortly disappear . Footnotes - Hebrews 8:1 Speaking about a high priest means speaking about worship , the Covenant , the sanctuary , and sacrifices . Point by point , the author describes the practices of Jewish worship ; in doing so his aim is to draw a radical contrast between them and the immense newness of Christ . Jesus not only excelled the Levitical priests in dignity ; he also accomplished the true worship that surpasses all prestige from the ceremonial codified in the Law of Moses . - Hebrews 8:1 The author recalls some passages of the Bible ( Ps 110:1-4 ; Num 24:6 ; Ex 25:40 ) to show that both the sanctuary in the wilderness and the sanctuary in Jerusalem were signs pointing to true worship , which consists in having access to God . As priest , Jesus acts at that level of reality and not at the level of signs . - Hebrews 8:4 By his human birth Jesus belonged to the tribe of Judah ( see Heb 7:12-14 ) , whereas priests were taken from the tribe of Levi ( see Deut 18:1 ) . Some scholars take the present tense of the verb “ offer ” as an indication that the temple was still standing in Jerusalem and so the Letter must have been written before A.D.
NCB	Hebrews	8	70	when the temple was destroyed by the Romans . - Hebrews 8:6 Israel was known as the people of the Covenant , the Covenant that was expressed in the Law and in worship . A text had been in circulation since the time of Jeremiah that was critical of the past and full of hope for a new future : it was the prophecy of the New Covenant , with which everyone was familiar ( see Jer 31:31-34 ) . The author cites it in its entirety ( vv . 8-12 ) . In this New Covenant the relationship between God and human beings will no longer be based on laws and institutions , but will have as its basis the person of Jesus Christ , mediator of a life-giving relationship with God ( see
NCB	Hebrews	9	9	This is a symbol of the present time , during which the gifts and sacrifices that are offered are unable to cleanse the conscience of the worshiper .
NCB	Hebrews	9	1	Now the first covenant also had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary .
NCB	Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was constructed . In the outer section , called the Holy Place , were located the lampstand , the table , and the consecrated bread .
NCB	Hebrews	9	3	Behind the second veil was the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies
NCB	Hebrews	9	4	in which stood the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold . In that ark were the gold jar containing the manna , and Aaron ’ s staff that had sprouted buds , and the tablets of the covenant .
NCB	Hebrews	9	5	Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement ( but we can not discuss these things in detail now ) .
NCB	Hebrews	9	6	With these arrangements for worship having been made , the priests continually enter the first tabernacle to carry out their ritual duties .
NCB	Hebrews	9	7	However , the high priest alone enters the second tabernacle , and he can do so only once a year , and not without the blood that he offers for himself and for the errors that the people had committed .
NCB	Hebrews	9	8	By this the Holy Spirit reveals to us that as long as the first tabernacle remains standing , the way into the sanctuary has not been disclosed .
NCB	Hebrews	9	10	They deal only with food and drink and various ceremonial washings , regulations in regard to the body that are imposed until the coming of the new order .
NCB	Hebrews	9	11	) . - Hebrews 9:15 In the Jewish mind sacrifice and blood were reminders of atonement and Covenant ( see Ex
NCB	Hebrews	9	12	and he has entered once for all into the sanctuary not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood , thus obtaining eternal redemption .
NCB	Hebrews	9	13	The blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of ashes of a heifer sanctify those who have been defiled and restore bodily purity .
NCB	Hebrews	9	14	How much more , then , will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God , purify our conscience from acts that lead to death so that we may worship the living God .
NCB	Hebrews	9	15	and
NCB	Hebrews	9	16	. - Hebrews 9:24 Everything that could envisage priesthood , rites , and cults , without in fact obtaining them , is now a reality in Christ : sin is forgiven , access to God is available , reconciliation is realized , and the Paschal event is living , efficacious , and eternal . Christ , who offered himself , is at God ’ s right hand for the benefit of human beings . There is no need of new sacrifices , and so he will not return for that but for the complete fulfillment of his promise of life and love .
NCB	Hebrews	9	17	For a will takes effect only at death , since it has no force while the one who made it is still alive .
NCB	Hebrews	9	18	Hence , not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood .
NCB	Hebrews	9	19	For when all the commandments of the Law had been proclaimed by Moses to all the people , he took the blood of calves and goats , together with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people ,
NCB	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded you to observe. ”
NCB	Hebrews	9	21	And in the same way , he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the liturgical vessels .
NCB	Hebrews	9	22	Indeed , under the Law almost everything is purified by blood , and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
NCB	Hebrews	9	23	Therefore , it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites , but the heavenly things themselves required still greater sacrifices .
NCB	Hebrews	9	24	) . The New Covenant is accomplished by the Paschal Mystery of Christ . In Greek , the word diathêkê signified both “ covenant ” and “ testament ” ; it was easy to move from the one meaning to the other , as the author does in vv .
NCB	Hebrews	9	25	Nor was it his purpose to offer himself again and again , as the high priest enters into the sanctuary year after year with the blood that is not his own .
NCB	Hebrews	9	26	For then he would have had to suffer over and over again since the creation of the world . But as it is , he has appeared once and for all at the end of the ages to abolish sin by sacrificing himself .
NCB	Hebrews	9	27	And just as human beings are destined to die but once , and after that to face judgment ,
NCB	Hebrews	9	28	so Christ , having been offered once to take away the sins of many , will appear a second time , not to deal with sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him . Footnotes - Hebrews 9:1 Once a year , on the Day of Atonement ( see Lev 16:2-19 ; Ex 30:10 ) , the high priest entered alone into the innermost part of the temple , the Holy of Holies . He poured blood on the altar to obtain forgiveness of sins . ( For more details on the worship in the temple , see Ex 25–31 and 35–40 . ) - Hebrews 9:11 The whole of Jewish hope , which was revived on the Day of Atonement , now finds its definitive fulfillment in the Passover of Christ . His is the true sacrifice . This time , a human being sheds his own blood , i.e. , willingly gives his life to God for the benefit of his brothers and sisters ; this time , a human being purifies the human conscience from within by his obedience ; this time , a human being has access to God . The risen Christ remains in this relationship of giving and presence , once and for all , definitively and eternally . There is no longer any other sacrifice to perform . This is the future , filled with “ the good things that have come ” ( v.
NCB	Hebrews	10	10	And it was by this “ will ” that we have been consecrated through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
NCB	Hebrews	10	1	The Law contains little more than a shadow of the good things to come and not the true image of them . These sacrifices that are offered year after year can never bring the worshipers to perfection .
NCB	Hebrews	10	2	If they could , those sacrifices would no longer be offered , for the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all and would no longer feel guilty for sins .
NCB	Hebrews	10	3	However , in these sacrifices sins are brought to mind year after year ,
NCB	Hebrews	10	4	because sins can not be taken away by the blood of bulls and goats . One Sacrifice for Sins .
NCB	Hebrews	10	5	That is why , when Christ came into the world , he said , “ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , but a body you have prepared for me .
NCB	Hebrews	10	6	You took no delight in holocausts and sin offerings .
NCB	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ As it is written of me in the scroll , behold , I have come to do your will , O God. ’ ”
NCB	Hebrews	10	8	First he says , “ Sacrifices and offerings , holocausts and sin offerings , you neither desired nor delighted in , ” even though they are offered according to the Law .
NCB	Hebrews	10	9	Then he adds , “ Behold , I have come to do your will. ” He thus abolishes the first to establish the second .
NCB	Hebrews	10	11	[ b ] Day after day every priest stands to perform his ministry , offering over and over again the same sacrifices that can never remove sins .
NCB	Hebrews	10	12	But Jesus offered one sacrifice for sins for all time , and then took his seat at the right hand of God ,
NCB	Hebrews	10	13	where he now waits until his enemies are made his footstool .
NCB	Hebrews	10	14	Therefore , by a single offering he has made perfect forever those who are being sanctified .
NCB	Hebrews	10	15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this . For he first says ,
NCB	Hebrews	10	16	“ This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , says the Lord . I will place my laws in their hearts and inscribe them on their minds. ”
NCB	Hebrews	10	17	Then he also asserts , “ Their sins and their lawless acts I will remember no more. ”
NCB	Hebrews	10	18	When these have been forgiven , there are no longer any offerings for sins . Perseverance in Faith [ c ] The Need To Stand Firm
NCB	Hebrews	10	19	Let Us Approach with Sincerity of Heart . [ d ] Therefore , brethren , the blood of Jesus has given us confidence to enter the sanctuary
NCB	Hebrews	10	20	by the new and living way that he has opened for us through the veil , that is , through his flesh .
NCB	Hebrews	10	21	Since we have a great priest over the household of God ,
NCB	Hebrews	10	22	let us approach with sincerity of heart and the full assurance of faith , with hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and bodies washed in pure water .
NCB	Hebrews	10	23	Let us remain firm in the confession of our hope without wavering , for the one who made the promise is trustworthy .
NCB	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider how to spur one another to love and good works .
NCB	Hebrews	10	25	Do not neglect to attend your assemblies , as some do , but rather encourage one another , especially since you can see the Day [ e ] approaching .
NCB	Hebrews	10	26	Apostasy Remains Unforgiven . [ f ] If we deliberately persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth , then there no longer remains any sacrifice for sins .
NCB	Hebrews	10	27	There is only a terrifying expectation of judgment and of a fierce fire that will consume the adversaries .
NCB	Hebrews	10	28	Anyone who violates the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses .
NCB	Hebrews	10	29	How much more punishment do you think is deserved by the one who has contempt for the Son of God , profanes the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified , and insults the Spirit of grace ?
NCB	Hebrews	10	30	For we know the one who said , “ Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , ” and “ The Lord will judge his people. ”
NCB	Hebrews	10	31	It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
NCB	Hebrews	10	32	Do Not Abandon Your Assurance . [ g ] Remember the days gone by when , after you had been enlightened , [ h ] you endured a difficult struggle filled with suffering .
NCB	Hebrews	10	33	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to abuse and persecution , and sometimes you were companions of those who were treated in the same way .
NCB	Hebrews	10	34	You not only had compassion upon those who were in prison but also cheerfully accepted the confiscation of your property , because you realized that you possessed something better and more lasting .
NCB	Hebrews	10	35	Therefore , do not lose your confidence now , since your reward will be so great .
NCB	Hebrews	10	36	You need to be steadfast if you want to do the will of God and receive what he has promised .
NCB	Hebrews	10	37	“ For , after a little while , he who is to come will do so , and he will not delay .
NCB	Hebrews	10	38	My righteous one shall live by faith , but if he shrinks back , I will not be pleased with him. ”
NCB	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not among those who draw back and are lost . Rather , we are among those who have faith and are saved . Footnotes - Hebrews 10:1 The great , endless act of self-giving that extends through the entire existence of Christ is the authentic priestly act , the authentic sacrifice of Christ . He takes away sin and restores the bond with God in his own person , in his own living experience . He founds the New Covenant , the new people who have access to God . - Hebrews 10:11 Every priest stands to perform his ministry . . . Jesus . . . took his seat : members of the Levitical priesthood always “ stood ” because their work was never finished ; Jesus “ took his seat ” because his work was completed . - Hebrews 10:19 A definitive event has been realized for the world : the Death and Resurrection of Christ . The Letter to the Hebrews makes us aware of this by presenting it as the act of the authentic priesthood , the authentic sacrifice , while at the same time downgrading the status of the preceding religious regime , although that too had been established by God . So , too , faith in Christ is a decisive step forward in the life of a human being . The believer is henceforth engaged in a march toward the full encounter with the Lord . In the midst of temptations , fears , and risks , the Christian life is not a simple fidelity to a past but a thrust forward toward the future , toward God . These chapters are a pressing invitation not to let such perspectives be obscured . - Hebrews 10:19 The path that leads to God is a person , Christ recognized under the characteristics of a high priest . Once baptized , Christians are associated with the Son of God . They must strengthen their conviction and the links of mutual love . May the signs of crises be a call for them to prepare for the return of the Lord . - Hebrews 10:25 The Day : this refers to the Day of the Lord at the end of time . - Hebrews 10:26 Once again the author repeats this somber warning ( see Heb 6:1-8 ; Mt 12:31 ) . Those who rebel against Christ exclude themselves from Christ ’ s forgiveness , from his life , and from his grace . Let them , therefore , meditate on the threats of God ’ s vengeance about which the Bible speaks , and especially the texts cited here ( see Ex 24:8 ; Deut 17:6 ; 32:35f ; Isa 26:11 ) . - Hebrews 10:32 As soon as they were baptized and enlightened , believers sacrificed everything for Christ and confronted all difficulties . Now is not the time for them to be discouraged . The Lord will come and he is the recompense for all who do not weaken . Faith is the courageous commitment to Christ . - Hebrews 10:32 Been enlightened : an ancient phrase for “ been baptized ” ; “ enlightenment ” or “ illumination ” was an ancient term for Baptism ( see Heb 6:4 ; Eph 5:14 ) .
NCB	Hebrews	11	11	By faith Abraham also received the power of procreation , even though he was well past the age—and Sarah herself was barren [ h ] —because he believed that the one who had made the promise would be faithful in fulfilling it .

Sawed in two : an ancient Jewish tradition said that Isaiah was killed in this way by order of King Manasseh . - Hebrews 11:40 The saints of the Old Testament were able to reach the perfection of life with God only through Christ , who is “ the resurrection and the life ” ( Jn 11:25f ) .
NCB	Hebrews	11	3	) . - Hebrews 11:35 Their dead : allusion to the two miracles worked by Elijah and Elisha (
NCB	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel [ d ] offered to God a better sacrifice than that of Cain . Because of this he was attested as righteous , God himself bearing witness to his gifts . Although he is dead , he continues to speak through it .
NCB	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch [ e ] was taken up so that he did not see death . He was found no more , because God had taken him , and before he was taken up he was attested to have pleased God .

NCB	Hebrews	11	13	All these died in faith without having received what had been promised , but from a distance they saw far ahead how those promises would be fulfilled and welcomed them , and acknowledged themselves to be strangers and foreigners on the earth .
NCB	Hebrews	11	14	People who speak in this way make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own .
NCB	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind , they would have had the opportunity to return .
NCB	Hebrews	11	16	; Gal 3:7 ,
NCB	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when put to the test , offered up Isaac . He who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son ,
NCB	Hebrews	11	18	of whom he had been told , “ Through Isaac descendants shall bear your name. ”
NCB	Hebrews	11	19	For he reasoned that God was able even to raise someone from the dead , and in a sense he was given back Isaac from the dead . [ i ]
NCB	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac [ j ] gave his blessings to Jacob and Esau for the future .
NCB	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , [ k ] as he was dying , blessed each one of the sons of Joseph and bowed in worship , leaning on his staff .
NCB	Hebrews	11	22	) ; in this respect , he prefigured Jesus crucified and risen . - Hebrews 11:20 Isaac : see Gen 27:1—28:5 . - Hebrews 11:21 Jacob : see Gen 47:28—49:33 . Each one of the sons : both of Joseph ’ s sons , Ephraim and Manasseh , received a blessing from Jacob ; hence two tribes descended from Joseph whereas only one tribe descended from each of his brothers . - Hebrews 11:22 Joseph : see Gen 37:1—50:26 . - Hebrews 11:23 Moses : see Ex 1–15 ; Acts 7:17-36 . - Hebrews 11:30 Jericho : see Jos
NCB	Hebrews	11	23	; Jer 15:1 ) . - Hebrews 11:33 Mouths of lions : e.g. , Daniel in the lions ’ den ( see Dan
NCB	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called a son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter .
NCB	Hebrews	11	25	He preferred to be ill-treated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin .
NCB	Hebrews	11	26	He considered that abuse suffered for the sake of the Messiah was a more precious gift than all the treasures of Egypt , for he was looking ahead to the final reward .
NCB	Hebrews	11	27	By faith Moses departed from Egypt , unafraid of the wrath of the king ; he persevered as if he could see the one who is invisible .
NCB	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood so that the Destroyer would not harm the firstborn of Israel .
NCB	Hebrews	11	29	) . - Hebrews 11:11 Sarah herself was barren : probably refers to the fact that she was past the age of childbearing ( see Gen 18:11f ) . - Hebrews 11:19 Isaac , who was to be sacrificed , was saved and came back from the dead , so to speak ( see Gen
NCB	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho [ n ] fell when the people had marched around them for seven days .
NCB	Hebrews	11	31	By faith Rahab [ o ] the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient , for she had received the spies in peace .
NCB	Hebrews	11	32	The Faith of the Judges and Prophets . What more shall I say ? Time is too short for me to speak of Gideon , Barak , Samson , and Jephthah , of David and Samuel and the Prophets , [ p ]
NCB	Hebrews	11	33	who by faith conquered kingdoms , administered justice , and obtained the promises . They closed the mouths of lions , [ q ]
NCB	Hebrews	11	34	quenched raging fires , [ r ] and escaped the edge of the sword . Their weakness was turned into strength as they became mighty in battle and put foreign armies to flight .
NCB	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead [ s ] back through resurrection . Others who were tortured refused to accept release in order to obtain a better resurrection .
NCB	Hebrews	11	36	Still others were mocked and scourged , even to the point of enduring chains and imprisonment .
NCB	Hebrews	11	37	) . A similar list of heroes is found in Sirach ( 44:1—50:21 ) . - Hebrews 11:4 Abel : see Gen 4:1-15 . Christ himself referred to the righteousness of Abel ( see Mt 23:35 ) . - Hebrews 11:5 Enoch : see note on Gen 4:25—5:32 ( last paragraph ) . - Hebrews 11:7 Noah : see Gen 5:28—9:29 ; Ezek 14:14 . - Hebrews 11:8 Abraham : see Gen 11:27—25:11 . The New Testament refers to this Patriarch as the exemplar of those who live by faith and as the father of all believers ( see Rom 4:11f ,
NCB	Hebrews	11	38	The world was not worthy of them . They wandered about in desert areas and on mountains , and they lived in dens and caves of the earth .
NCB	Hebrews	11	39	Yet all these , even though they were commended for their faith , did not receive what was promised .
NCB	Hebrews	11	40	For God had made provision for us to have something better , and they were not to achieve perfection except with us . [ u ] Footnotes - Hebrews 11:1 Before exhorting his readers to serve Christ , the author shows the importance and power of faith throughout sacred history . This is a magnificent chapter of Biblical theology that should inspire the courage of believers and urge them to read the Old Testament in order to give new vigor to the impulse of faith . - Hebrews 11:1 Theologians have often cited this sentence . Faith establishes human beings in the invisible and orients them toward the future , toward the fulfillment . The spiritual writer Charles Péguy affirmed : “ The faith that I love most , says God , is hope. ” - Hebrews 11:4 Christian faith has firm roots in the Old Testament . Note v.
NCB	Hebrews	12	12	Therefore , strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees ,
NCB	Hebrews	12	1	Therefore , since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses , [ b ] let us throw off everything that weighs us down and the sins that so easily distract us and with perseverance run the race that lies ahead of us ,
NCB	Hebrews	12	2	with our eyes fixed on Jesus , the author and perfecter of our faith . For the sake of the joy that lay before him , he endured the cross , ignoring its shame , and is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God .
NCB	Hebrews	12	3	Reflect on how he endured such great hostility from sinners so that you may not grow weary and lose heart .
NCB	Hebrews	12	4	In your struggle against sin , you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood . God Is Treating You as His Children . [ c ]
NCB	Hebrews	12	5	You have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as children : “ My son , do not scorn the discipline of the Lord or lose heart when you are punished by him .
NCB	Hebrews	12	6	For the Lord disciplines those whom he loves , and he chastises every son whom he acknowledges. ”
NCB	Hebrews	12	7	Endure the trials you receive as a form of discipline . God is treating you as sons . For what son is there who is not disciplined by his father ?
NCB	Hebrews	12	8	If you have not received the discipline in which all share , then you are illegitimate and not true sons .
NCB	Hebrews	12	9	In addition , we have all received discipline from our earthly fathers , and we respected them . Should we not then be even more willing to submit to the Father of spirits and live ?
NCB	Hebrews	12	10	They disciplined us for a short time as they thought best , but he does so for our benefit so that we may share his holiness .
NCB	Hebrews	12	11	At the time that discipline is received , it always seems painful rather than pleasant , but afterward it yields a harvest of peace and uprightness to those who have been trained by it .
NCB	Hebrews	12	13	and make straight paths for your feet , so that your weakened limbs may not be disabled but rather may be healed .
NCB	Hebrews	12	14	Seek Peace and Sanctification . [ d ] Seek peace with everyone , as well as the holiness without which no one will ever see the Lord .
NCB	Hebrews	12	15	See to it that no one is deprived of the grace of God , and that no root of bitterness may spring up and cause trouble , resulting in the defilement of many .
NCB	Hebrews	12	16	Do not be like Esau , an immoral and worldly-minded person who sold his birthright for a single meal .
NCB	Hebrews	12	17	Afterward , as you know , when he sought to inherit the blessing , he was rejected . Even though he sought it with tears , he found no possibility for repentance .
NCB	Hebrews	12	18	Listen to the One Who Is Speaking . [ e ] You have not come to something that can be touched : a blazing fire , or complete darkness , or gloom , or a storm ,
NCB	Hebrews	12	19	or the sound of a trumpet , or a voice speaking words that made those who heard them beg that nothing more be said to them .
NCB	Hebrews	12	20	For they could not bear to hear the command that was given , “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it must be stoned to death. ”
NCB	Hebrews	12	21	Indeed , so terrifying was the sight that Moses cried out , “ I am terrified and trembling. ”
NCB	Hebrews	12	22	But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem . You have come to myriads of angels in joyful gathering ,
NCB	Hebrews	12	23	and to the assembly of the firstborn [ f ] whose names are written in heaven , and to God the judge of all , and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect .
NCB	Hebrews	12	24	You have come to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks more powerfully than even the blood of Abel .
NCB	Hebrews	12	25	See that you do not reject the one who is speaking . For if those did not escape when they rejected the one who warned them on earth , how much more is this true of us if we turn away from the one who is from heaven ?
NCB	Hebrews	12	26	At that time , his voice shook the earth , but now he has promised , “ Once more I will shake not only the earth but heaven as well. ”
NCB	Hebrews	12	27	The words “ once more ” indicate the removal of what can be shaken—that is , all created things—so that what can not be shaken may remain .
NCB	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , since we are receiving a kingdom that can not be shaken , let us give thanks , offering to God a worship that is pleasing to him .
NCB	Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire . Footnotes - Hebrews 12:1 Christians have only one person on whom to keep their eyes as the object of faith and salvation : Christ ( see Heb 11:26f ; Acts 7:55f ; Phil 3:8 ) . They look to the Crucified Lord to understand how to behave at all times , and especially in difficulties and persecution . - Hebrews 12:1 Surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses : the author may be thinking of an athletic contest in a large amphitheater wherein the heroes just mentioned are inspiring examples for us , urging us on to stand firm in the faith and even to martyrdom if need be . - Hebrews 12:5 God treats us as his sons and daughters . And the trials that we must withstand in order to make progress in the faith is another sign of this point for us . Hence , we must take heart . - Hebrews 12:14 Once again the author places their responsibilities before his hearers . They must not revert to the past by returning to Judaism . This would be tantamount to dishonoring the gift of salvation and perverting the atmosphere of the community . - Hebrews 12:18 The author alludes to the Covenant of Sinai , which was a fascinating and terrifying spectacle in the history of Israel ( see Ex 19–20 ; Deut 4:11 ; 9:19 ) . The New Covenant is a celebration of peace and festivity . Israel ’ s way of life was only a figure for the conduct of the Church . Once people are gripped by the Covenant of grace , they can not turn back toward an insufficient religion of yesteryear—that would be to show disdain for God . The Lord is “ a consuming fire ” : the image evokes all at once his holiness , his demands , his judgment to the very depths of a being , and his hold that burns one ’ s existence . - Hebrews 12:23 Assembly of the firstborn : either all the elect or the angels as the first creatures .
NCB	Hebrews	13	13	) . - Hebrews 13:7 The remembrance of leaders , who perhaps confronted martyrdom , is a call to fidelity . It provides the author with the opportunity to insert a new development in the Letter . Christians must cling to the teaching received from their leaders and not to the doctrines of Judaism . They should , therefore , look to Christ ; only in him and nowhere else will believers find what can evoke the altar or the sacrifice . If Christ suffered outside of Jerusalem and not in the temple , was that not perhaps a sign that the worship of Mosaic times must be replaced by the definitive worship , which is spiritual ? Note three important verses in this section : v.
NCB	Hebrews	13	1	Let mutual love continue ,
NCB	Hebrews	13	2	and do not forget to offer hospitality to strangers , for by doing this some have entertained angels without knowing it . [ b ]
NCB	Hebrews	13	3	Be mindful of those who are in prison , as though you were imprisoned with them , and of those who are being maltreated , since you too are in the body .
NCB	Hebrews	13	4	Let marriage be held in honor by all , and the marriage bed kept undefiled , for those who are immoral and adulterers will have to face God ’ s judgment .
NCB	Hebrews	13	5	Do not succumb to the love of money , but be content with what you have , for God has said , “ I will never forsake you or abandon you. ”

NCB	Hebrews	13	9	, the author uses the great Jewish rite of atonement as a point of comparison ( see Lev 16:27 ) . - Hebrews 13:12 Christ ’ s death outside Jerusalem symbolized the removal of sin in the same way that the removal of the bodies of sacrificed animals outside the camp of Israel had done . - Hebrews 13:13 Let us then go to him outside the camp : this is a call to separate from Judaism . Just as Christ died in disgrace outside the city , so Christians should be willing to face scorn by leaving Judaism for Christ . - Hebrews 13:15 Sacrifice of praise : “ sacrifice ” here means an offering to God ( see Rom 12:1 ; Phil 4:18 ) . There is no longer need for animal sacrifices . - Hebrews 13:16 Christians will have to facilitate the task of the leaders of the community and to put their preoccupations in prayer , even when these leaders believe themselves obliged to remind them of the difficult demands of fidelity . - Hebrews 13:20 The author artfully summarizes his ideas and his concerns . The news that he gives seems to indicate that he is waiting for Timothy in order to visit Palestine with him . The mention of “ those from Italy ” can indicate that he is in a port in Italy or simply that he is surrounded by Italians in some city of the Empire . - Hebrews 13:23 Timothy has been set free : the event to which the author is referring is unknown to us . - Hebrews 13:24 Saints : a term in use among the early Church for God ’ s people , those who have been set apart as holy to the Lord ( see note on Rom 1:7 ) .
NCB	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar [ d ] from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat .

NCB	James	1	2	My brethren , consider it a cause of great joy whenever you endure various trials ,
NCB	James	1	3	for you know that the testing of your faith will develop perseverance .
NCB	James	1	4	And let perseverance complete its work so that you may become perfect and complete , and not be deficient in any respect . A Believer ’ s Prayer . [ c ]
NCB	James	1	5	If someone among you lacks wisdom , he should ask God , who gives to all generously and without finding fault , and it will be given to him .
NCB	James	1	6	But he is to ask with faith , without doubting , for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind .
NCB	James	1	7	A man like that should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord ,
NCB	James	1	8	since he is of two minds and inconsistent in everything he does . Rich and Poor . [ d ]
NCB	James	1	9	The brother who is in modest circumstances should take pride in being raised up .
NCB	James	1	10	Likewise , the one who is rich should glory in being brought low , for he will disappear like a flower of the field .
NCB	James	1	11	Once the sun comes up with its scorching rays and withers the grass , its flower droops and its beauty vanishes . So too the rich man will fade away in the midst of his affairs .
NCB	James	1	12	; Mt 5:3 ; Lk 1:52 ) . - James 1:12 Those who bear trials patiently will go from distress to sharing the joy and life of the Lord . - James 1:13 The passage from trials to temptations reveals the depths of a person—and is one more reason to be vigilant . - James 1:16 Light and life are opposed to sin and death . They are the grace of the new birth through the Gospel and Baptism . - James 1:19 It costs nothing to place oneself among the distracted listeners and let oneself go to the demon of words for the sake of words . Hearing the Gospel for the sake of putting it into practice obliges one to notice the sufferings of others , to be concerned with truth , to cling to the Christian originality in the face of current mentalities and morals .
NCB	James	1	13	[ f ] While experiencing temptation , no one should say , “ God is tempting me. ” For God can not be tempted by evil , and he himself tempts no one .
NCB	James	1	14	Rather , temptation occurs when someone is attracted and seduced by his own desire .
NCB	James	1	15	Then the desire conceives and gives birth to sin , and that sin , when it reaches full growth , gives birth to death .
NCB	James	1	16	Light and Life . [ g ] Do not be deceived , my beloved brethren .
NCB	James	1	17	Every good act of giving and every perfect gift are from above , coming down from the Father of all light . With him there is no alteration or shadow caused by change .
NCB	James	1	18	By his own choice he gave us birth through the way of truth so that we may be a kind of firstfruits of all his creation . Exhortation To Practice Faith
NCB	James	1	19	Living by God ’ s Word . [ h ] Remember this , my beloved brethren : everyone should be quick to listen but slow to speak and slow to anger .
NCB	James	1	20	For human anger does not bring about the righteousness of God .
NCB	James	1	21	Therefore , rid yourselves of everything sordid and of every wicked excess , and welcome in all humility the word that is implanted in you and is able to save your souls .
NCB	James	1	22	Be doers of the word and not just hearers who only deceive themselves .
NCB	James	1	23	For anyone who listens to the word and fails to do it is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror .
NCB	James	1	24	After seeing his reflection , he goes off and immediately forgets what he looked like .
NCB	James	1	25	However , the one who looks intently at the perfect law of freedom and perseveres—not forgetting what he has heard but putting it into practice—will be blessed in everything he does .
NCB	James	1	26	If anyone thinks that he is religious but does not restrain his tongue , he is deceiving himself , and his religion is worthless .
NCB	James	1	27	Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and undefiled is this : to come to the aid of orphans and widows in their hardships and to keep oneself untarnished by the world .

NCB	James	2	1	Jn 3:17 illustrates a love that is faulty . What is needed is a faith that is genuine , i.e. , operative . - James 2:25 Rahab the prostitute : the author of the Letter is not intending to approve Rahab ’ s occupation but simply to commend the faith she showed in helping the spies ( see Jos
NCB	James	2	3	If you lavish special attention on the one wearing the expensive clothes and say , “ Please sit in this good seat , ” while to the poor man you say , “ Stand over there , ” or “ Sit on the floor at my feet , ”
NCB	James	2	4	have you not shown favoritism among yourselves and judged by wrongful standards ?
NCB	James	2	5	Listen to me , my beloved brethren . Did not God choose those who are poor [ b ] in the world to be rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him ?
NCB	James	2	6	But you have humiliated the poor man . Furthermore , is it not the rich who oppress you ? Are they not the ones who drag you into court ?
NCB	James	2	7	Is it not they who blaspheme the noble name that was invoked over you ?
NCB	James	2	8	You will be doing well if you truly observe the sovereign law enjoined in Scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”
NCB	James	2	9	However , if you show partiality , you are committing a sin and stand convicted by the law as lawbreakers .
NCB	James	2	10	For whoever observes the whole Law but trips up on a single point is held guilty of breaking all of it .
NCB	James	2	11	The one who said , “ You shall not commit adultery , ” also said , “ You shall not kill. ” Now if you do not commit adultery but you do kill , you have become a lawbreaker .
NCB	James	2	12	Therefore , always speak and act as those who will be judged by the law of freedom .
NCB	James	2	13	For judgment will be without mercy to the one who has not shown mercy , but mercy triumphs over judgment .
NCB	James	2	14	True Faith Is Proved by Works . [ c ] What good is it , my brethren , if someone claims to have faith but does not have good works ? Can such faith save him ?
NCB	James	2	15	[ d ] Suppose a brother or sister is naked and lacks his or her daily food .
NCB	James	2	16	If one of you says to such a person , “ Go in peace ; keep warm and eat well , ” but does not take care of that person ’ s physical needs , what is the good of that ?
NCB	James	2	17	In the same way , faith by itself is dead if it does not have works .
NCB	James	2	18	But perhaps someone will say , “ You have faith and I have works. ” Show me your faith without works , and by works I will show you my faith .
NCB	James	2	19	You believe that there is one God . You do well to assert that . But even the demons believe and tremble .
NCB	James	2	20	You fool ! Do you want proof that faith without works is futile ?
NCB	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
NCB	James	2	22	Thus , you can see that his faith and his works were active together ; his faith was brought to completion by works .
NCB	James	2	23	Thus , the words of Scripture were fulfilled that say , “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , ” and he was called the friend of God .
NCB	James	2	24	You can see , then , that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone .
NCB	James	2	25	Likewise , Rahab the prostitute , [ e ] was she not also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away by a different road ?
NCB	James	2	26	For just as the body is dead without a spirit , so faith without works is also dead . Footnotes - James 2:1 Remaining impartial is the most difficult as well as the most significant demand of the Bible and the Gospel . But even in the liturgical assembly notables are often honored because of their fortune and their culture , while the poor are sometimes put down . The Gospel can not stand for such discrimination . On the contrary , it calls for all to be poor . - James 2:5 Poor : the poor of the Lord , who relied on God alone and were in turn loved by God and under his protection ( see Ps 35:10 ; Isa 61:1 ; Mt 5:3 ; 11:5 ; Lk 6:20 ;
NCB	James	3	3	When we put a bit into a horse ’ s mouth to make it obey us , we also guide its entire body .
NCB	James	3	1	My brethren , not many of you should become teachers , for you know that we will face a more severe judgment .
NCB	James	3	2	For all of us fall short in many ways . Anyone who never makes a mistake in speech has reached perfection [ b ] and is able to control every part of his body .
NCB	James	3	4	Or think of ships . Even though they are large and are driven by strong winds , they are steered by a very small rudder on whatever course the helmsman chooses .
NCB	James	3	5	In the same way , the tongue is a small member but its pretensions are great . Consider how a small fire can set ablaze a great forest .
NCB	James	3	6	And the tongue is also a fire , a world of evil that infects the entire body . It sets afire the entire course of our existence and is itself set on fire by Gehenna .
NCB	James	3	7	For every species of beast and bird , of reptile and sea creature , can be tamed and has been tamed by man ,
NCB	James	3	8	but no one can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison .
NCB	James	3	9	With it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God . [ c ]
NCB	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth flow blessings and curses . This should not be so , my brethren .
NCB	James	3	11	Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water ?
NCB	James	3	12	Can a fig tree , my brethren , produce olives or can a grapevine produce figs ? Neither can salt water yield fresh water .
NCB	James	3	13	True Wisdom and Its Opposite . [ d ] Who among you is wise and understanding ? Prove by your good life that your works are done with the humility that comes from wisdom .
NCB	James	3	14	But if your hearts are filled with bitter envy and selfish ambition , do not be boastful in defiance of the truth .
NCB	James	3	15	Such wisdom does not come down from above , but is earthly , unspiritual , and demonic .
NCB	James	3	16	For where there is envy and selfish ambition , there will also be disharmony and every type of wickedness .
NCB	James	3	17	However , the wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure , then peaceable , gentle , and considerate , full of mercy and good fruits , without any trace of partiality or hypocrisy .
NCB	James	3	18	And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who are peacemakers . Footnotes - James 3:1 What is more beautiful and what more ugly than the tongue ? All the wisdoms of the world repeat it , and the sages of the Old Testament more than once issued denunciations against inconsiderate words ( see Prov 10:9 ; 13:3 ; 15:1-4 ; 18:21 ; 21:23 ; Sir 5:11—6:1 ) . Christ had spoken of the evil that comes forth from the mouth of man ( see Mk 7:21-23 ) . There is a kind of passionate outburst of words that disfigures society ; with a word one can disrupt an assembly , with a lie break a friendship or unleash a rivalry—in short , destroy the world ’ s harmony . We might say that an infernal power is at work ; “ Gehenna ” was the cursed spot around Jerusalem that became a symbol for hell . The author is speaking especially to those who have the responsibility to teach in the assemblies . What a perversion it is to announce God ’ s praise yet do harm to one ’ s neighbor . - James 3:2 Perfection : so difficult is the tongue to control that those who are successful gain control of themselves in all other areas of life as well . - James 3:9 In the likeness of God : human beings are made in the likeness of God ( see Gen 1:26f ) ; hence , to curse them is tantamount to cursing God ( see Gen 9:6 ) . - James 3:13 There is a way of life and a concept of relationships that are inspired by a sense of God . There is another that is nothing more than the uncontrolled expression of passions . The Old Testament thus opposed wisdom and folly ( see Prov 2:6 ; 8:22-31 ; Wis 7:22—8:1 ; Sir 1:1-4 ; 24:3-22 ) . Paul distinguished between the fruits of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit ( see Gal 5:22-25 ) . The Christian faith is transmitted by mildness , conciliation , goodness , and peace .
NCB	James	4	4	Adulterers ! Do you not know that love of the world results in enmity with God ? Therefore , whoever wishes to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
NCB	James	4	1	What is the source of these conflicts and quarrels among you ? Are they not the result of your passions [ b ] that are at war within you ?
NCB	James	4	2	You want something that you can not have , so you commit murder . And you covet something but can not obtain it , so you engage in quarrels and fights . You do not have because you do not ask .
NCB	James	4	3	When you ask , you do not get what you want because you do not ask for it with the proper motives , seeking rather to indulge your passions .
NCB	James	4	5	Or do you suppose that it is without reason that Scripture says , “ He yearns jealously for the Spirit that he sent to live in us ” ? [ c ]
NCB	James	4	6	But he has bestowed an even stronger grace . Therefore , it says , “ God resists the proud , but he gives grace to the humble. ”
NCB	James	4	7	Hence , be subject to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
NCB	James	4	8	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you waverers .
NCB	James	4	9	Be sorrowful , lament , and weep . Let your laughter turn to mourning and your joy to gloom .
NCB	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord , and he will exalt you .
NCB	James	4	11	; 102:3 ; Wis 2:4 ; 5:9-14 ) , which obliges people to put their trust solely in God and not in self .
NCB	James	4	12	There is only one Lawgiver and Judge , the one who is able to save or to destroy . Who then are you to pass judgment on a neighbor ?
NCB	James	4	13	A Warning against Presumption . [ e ] Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we shall head off to this or that town and spend a year doing business there and making money. ”
NCB	James	4	14	Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring . What is your life , after all ? For you are like a mist that appears for a brief time and then vanishes .
NCB	James	4	15	Instead , what you ought to say is , “ If it is the Lord ’ s will , we shall live to do this or that. ”
NCB	James	4	16	But instead you boast in your arrogance , and all such boasting is evil .
NCB	James	4	17	Anyone who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it commits a sin . Footnotes - James 4:1 Troubles , unjust and murderous confrontations , and wars are the scourges of social life , and Christians share in them . Murderous passions are given free rein even in the community , creating antagonisms and divisions . The desire to possess and to monopolize things seems to be without limits and takes over the human heart . Hence , let all Christians question themselves about their innermost affiliation and choice . Do they really opt for God or do they live under the weight of their evil passions ? When someone became unfaithful to God in the concrete , the Old Testament as well as Christ designated it as adultery ( see Hos 3:1 ; Mt 12:39 ; 16:4 ) . All these evils are the result of a failure to pray . True prayer is a drawing near to God , and it requires a reversal of mentality . - James 4:1 Passions : literally , “ pleasures. ” The author is not saying that pleasures are evil in themselves ; the evil consists only in the way they are used . - James 4:5 He yearns jealously for the Spirit that he sent to live in us : two other translations are possible ( because James is citing a passage that does not appear in any extant Bible manuscript ) : “ The spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely ” and “ The Spirit he caused to live in us longs jealously. ” The meaning of the translation in the text is that God jealously longs for our fidelity and love ( see Jn 4:4 ) . The meaning of the first alternative translation is that because of the fall the spirit of man that was put in us at the Creation ( see Gen 2:7 ) envies intensely—however , God ’ s grace is able to overcome that envy ( see Ex 20:5 ) . The meaning of the second alternative translation is that it is the Holy Spirit who longs jealously for our full devotion . - James 4:11 Nothing is more current in the thoughts and conversations of human beings than passing judgment on others and slandering them . This is a usurpation . Only God can pass judgment , and it is he who has established a law—the law of love ( see Lev 19:16-18 ; Mt 7:1-5 ) . - James 4:13 This is a warning to those people who live only for the glory of their projects , the exploitation of others , and the lure of gain ( see Mk 8:36 ) . It reproduces the theme of human weakness ( see Pss 39:5-7 ,
NCB	James	5	5	You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence . You have gorged yourselves as on the day of slaughter .
NCB	James	5	1	Tim 4:16 ) . In speaking of a “ multitude of sins ” James is perhaps including the sins of both ( see Jas 2:13 ) .
NCB	James	5	2	Your riches have rotted . Your clothes are all moth-eaten .
NCB	James	5	3	Your gold and silver have corroded . Their corrosion will serve as a witness against you and consume your flesh like a fire . You have hoarded wealth for the last days .
NCB	James	5	4	Behold , the wages you fraudulently withheld from the laborers who harvested your fields are crying out , and the cries of those harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts .
NCB	James	5	6	You have condemned the righteous man and murdered him , even though he offered you no resistance . Patience , for the Lord ’ s Coming Is Near . [ b ]
NCB	James	5	7	Therefore be patient , brethren , until the coming of the Lord . Think of how patiently a farmer awaits the precious crop from his fields until they have received the early and the late rains .
NCB	James	5	8	You too must be patient . Take courage , for the coming of the Lord is near . [ c ]
NCB	James	5	9	Brethren , do not raise complaints against one another lest you yourselves be brought to judgment . Behold , the Judge is standing at the gates .
NCB	James	5	10	As an example of patience in enduring hardship , brethren , consider the Prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
NCB	James	5	11	Indeed , those who had perseverance are the ones we call blessed . You have heard of the perseverance of Job and have come to understand the Lord ’ s purpose in this respect , because the Lord is merciful and compassionate .
NCB	James	5	12	Do Not Swear . Above all , my brethren , do not swear , either by heaven or by earth , or use any oaths at all . Let your “ Yes ” mean “ Yes ” and your “ No ” mean “ No. ” Otherwise you may be condemned . [ d ]
NCB	James	5	13	Anointing of the Sick . [ e ] Is anyone among you suffering ? He should pray . Is anyone cheerful ? He should sing songs of praise .
NCB	James	5	14	, November
NCB	James	5	15	The prayer of faith will save the sick person , and the Lord will raise him up . And if he has committed any sins , he will be forgiven .
NCB	James	5	16	Confession and Intercession . Therefore , confess your sins to one another and pray for one another , so that you may be healed . The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective .
NCB	James	5	17	Elijah was a man like us . Yet when he prayed fervently that it might not rain for three and a half years , it did not rain on the earth .
NCB	James	5	18	Then he prayed again , and the heavens gave forth rain , and the earth once again brought forth its harvest . Conclusion
NCB	James	5	19	,
NCB	James	5	20	remember this : A person who brings back a sinner from erring ways will rescue his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins . Footnotes - James 5:1 Here , we hear again the cries of the Prophets denouncing the injustice and inhumanity of riches ( see Isa 5:8-10 ; Jer 5:26-30 ; Am 8:4-8 ) ; we also hear the voice of Christ placing us on guard against the danger of riches ( see Lk 6:24 ; 18:24-27 ) . The Bible has always seen the accumulation of goods as tarnished by some injustice . It instinctively feels how riches give birth to a type of person whose sense of his own human condition becomes warped and who loses sight of the proper relationship of fraternity and justice in regard to others . - James 5:7 For the Old Testament as well as for the New , the life of believers tends toward the final encounter with the Lord . The future of human beings does not rest in any terrestrial value in an absolute manner . It rests in God . - James 5:8 The expectation of the Lord ’ s Second Coming ( see
NCB	James	5	416	, to Decentius , Bishop of Gubbio ) justified the rite used in the Church and declared it to be a “ Sacrament ” ; this doctrine was later solemnly defined by the Council of Trent despite the opposition of the Protestants ( Session
NCB	James	5	25	,
NCB	James	5	1551	) . The reference to prayer ends with the example of Elijah . The Jewish tradition was familiar with several examples of Prophets who had interceded for the people ( see Gen 18:22-32 ; Ex 32:11-14 , 30-32 ) . Elijah was a very popular figure both in Jewish tradition and in the early Christian tradition ( which identified the coming Elijah with John the Baptist ) . - James 5:19 James regards the return of a straying brother to the truth as a real rescue from death ( see Mt 18:12-13 ;
NCB	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter 1:23 Born anew . . . through the . . . word of God : the Christian ’ s new birth results from the action of the Holy Spirit ( see Tit 3:5 ) , but the word of God also plays an important part therein ( see Jas 1:18 ) . The latter presents the Gospel to us and summons us to repent and believe in Christ ( see v.
NCB	1%20Peter	1	2	) sealing with God ’ s Covenant promise represented for us in the Eucharist ( see Lk 22:20 ) ; (
NCB	1%20Peter	1	3	) cleansing of all sin ( see
NCB	1%20Peter	1	4	, 9f ) . Those who are united with Christ in everything , including suffering , will also be united with him in glory . And in the midst of their present sufferings they will benefit from the fact that he has already entered into his glory ( see
NCB	1%20Peter	1	5	who because of your faith are being protected by God ’ s power until the salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time . [ f ]
NCB	1%20Peter	1	6	This is a reason for you to rejoice , even if now for a little while you must suffer trials of many kinds .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	7	Thus , the genuine quality of your faith—which is more valuable than gold that is perishable even if it has been tested by fire—may be proved worthy of praise , glory , and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	8	,
NCB	1%20Peter	1	9	For you are achieving the goal of your faith , that is , the salvation of your souls .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	10	This salvation was the subject of intense scrutiny and investigation by the Prophets [ g ] who spoke about the grace that you were to receive .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	11	They were searching out the time and the circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ [ h ] within them was pointing when it testified in advance to the sufferings that Christ would endure and the glories that would then follow .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	12	It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you when they spoke of the things that have now been announced to you through those who proclaimed the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven . Even the angels long to catch a glimpse of such things .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	13	Convictions for Living . [ i ] Therefore , prepare your minds for action . Be calm and fix your hopes completely on the grace that you will be granted at the revelation of Jesus Christ .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	14	Like obedient children , do not yield to the evil desires you had in your former ignorance .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	15	He who called you is holy . Therefore , be holy yourselves in all your conduct .
NCB	1%20Peter	1	16	For Scripture says , “ Be holy , for I am holy. ”

NCB	1%20John	3	17	If anyone is rich in worldly possessions and sees a brother in need but refuses to open his heart , how can the love of God abide in him ?

NCB	1%20John	4	13	) and this text . The whole theology of love is developed in these verses , which give us the deepest understanding of Christianity as a great movement of life and experience , and not an abstract speculation . Love is reality : i.e. , in God ; it is witnessed to in an experience : i.e. , in Christ ; and it is expressed in the reality of fraternal love : i.e. , among believers . God and love : the two words go together , just as do knowledge of God and fraternal love . The living discovery of God does not take place in plumbing the most compelling ideas but in becoming like Christ , in the experience of fraternal love . Without this , no fellowship with God is possible . Fraternal love and faith in Christ go together ; and this experience enables us to verify the value of every religion and every spirituality . Nothing else can deliver human beings from the fear of judgment . -

NCB	1%20John	4	17	This is how love is made perfect in us , enabling us to have confidence on the Day of Judgment , because even in this world we have become like him .

NCB	1%20John	5	1	John 5:18 The great certitudes that the speculations of the false teachers would like to shake are affirmed one last time , like a cry of victory . The community of God ’ s children , adhering to Christ , overcomes the forces of evil , truly knows God , and shares his life . To seek anything else is idolatry . The idols to be avoided are either paganism or the false gods of the heart that can turn believers away from faith and love .

Before his eyes the risen Christ appears . The majestic description derives its images from the portrait of the Son of Man in chs .

According to the third-century Church historian Eusebius , John the Apostle was released from Patmos under the emperor Nerva ( A.D. 96–98 ) . - Revelation 1:10 In the spirit : i.e. , in a state of spiritual ecstasy ( see also Rev 4:2 ; 17:3 ; and 21:10 ) . The Lord ’ s day : Sunday . In the Old Testament the expression “ Day of the Lord ” signifies some special intervention of God in history . For Christians , the eschatological age is the last times that have begun with the Resurrection of Christ ; to celebrate the Lord ’ s day means therefore to commemorate his Paschal victory and to hasten his return ( see Acts 20:7 ;
NCB	Revelation	2	2	. The morning star is the symbol of the Resurrection and its power—for Jesus rose from the dead just before dawn , the time when the morning star is visible . - Revelation 2:18 Thyatira : a military outpost noted for its trade guilds . - Revelation 2:24 The deep secrets of Satan : perhaps the esoteric teaching of the Nicolaitans .

NCB	Revelation	2	4	“ ‘ “ However , I have this complaint against you : you have lost the love you had at first .
NCB	Revelation	2	5	Remember from where you have fallen . Repent and do as you did originally . Otherwise , unless you repent , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place .
NCB	Revelation	2	6	Nonetheless , this may be said in your favor : you detest the works of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .

NCB	Revelation	2	10	Do not be frightened when thinking about the sufferings that you will have to endure . The devil will throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested , and you will endure affliction for ten days . Remain faithful until death , and I will give you the crown of life .

NCB	Revelation	2	12	To Pergamum . [ g ] “ To the angel of the Church in Pergamum , [ h ] write : “ ‘ These are the words of the one who has the sharp double-edged sword :
NCB	Revelation	2	13	) . One of the most famous early martyrs , Polycarp , was bishop of Smyrna . - Revelation 2:12 In this city , a main center of emperor worship , the presence of Satan is visible . Deviant heresies , like that of the Nicolaitans , glorify participation in pagan forms of worship and in the moral disorders they represent , which in the eyes of the Old Testament is tantamount to prostitution . The episode of Balaam is evoked to stigmatize these wanderings of the conscience of believers ( see Num 25:3 ; 31:16 ) . The reward is illustrated by two symbols : the manna , i.e. , the food of life ( see Ps 78:24f ) , evokes all the blessings God bestows on those who remain faithful to him , blessings of which the Eucharist is the sign ( see Ex 16:32-34 ;
NCB	Revelation	2	14	“ ‘ “ Nevertheless , I have a few things against you . Some of you are holding to the teaching of Balaam , [ j ] who instructed Balak to place temptations in the path of the Israelites , encouraging them to eat food sacrificed to idols and to engage in fornication .
NCB	Revelation	2	15	Likewise , there are some of you who follow the teaching of the Nicolaitans .
NCB	Revelation	2	16	Therefore , repent . If you do not do so , I will come to you quickly and attack them with the sword of my mouth .
NCB	Revelation	2	17	“ ‘ “ Whoever has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the Churches . To anyone who is victorious I will give some of the hidden manna . I will also give him a white stone , upon which will be inscribed a new name , known only to the person who receives it. ” ’

All three groups are usually termed Nicolaitans . ) The community of Ephesus does resist the danger that threatens it , but unfortunately in its effort to be faithful it has become judgmental . It has lost its charity . The time has come for it to be renewed . Otherwise , the community will lose its place . What a perspective is thus opened for fidelity ! A new access to the tree of life militates against succumbing to sin ( see Gen 2:9 ; 3:22-24 ) ; expressed in Jewish language , it is the hope of an unending life . - Revelation 2:1 Ephesus : see introduction to the Letter to the Ephesians . - Revelation 2:7 Whoever has ears should listen to what the Spirit says . . . : this formula concludes each of the seven letters and stresses the role of the Spirit in Christ ’ s relation with his Church . Anyone who is victorious : i.e. , anyone who clings to the faith in the face of persecution . Right to eat from the tree of life : a right lost by our first parents but now restored by Christ who abrogated the decree that excluded human beings from the tree of life . God and humans are restored to the perfect fellowship that existed before the advent of sin . - Revelation 2:8 Those Jews who did not acknowledge Christ as the one who fulfilled their hope , nor the Church as the true Israel , slandered the Christian community . They were regarded as partisans of the forces of opposition represented by Satan . However , the Christians must take courage , for the trial will last only for ten days , i.e. , it will be of short duration—the reward for a life in God is near . Believers will escape the second death , i.e. , defeat and definitive perdition at the judgment of God . - Revelation 2:8 Smyrna : a city closely aligned with Rome that housed a large Jewish population hostile to Christians ( see Acts 14:2 ,
NCB	Revelation	2	21	“ ‘ “ I have given her time to repent , but she refuses to repent of her fornication .
NCB	Revelation	2	22	So I will cast her onto a bed of pain , and all those who commit adultery with her will suffer intensely unless they renounce her practices .
NCB	Revelation	2	23	I will also strike her children dead . Thereby all the Churches will be shown that I am the one who searches minds and hearts and I will give to each of you what your works deserve .
NCB	Revelation	2	24	“ ‘ “ And I say to the rest of you in Thyatira who have not accepted this teaching and who have no knowledge of what are designated as the deep secrets of Satan , [ m ] I shall not impose any further burden on you ,

NCB	Revelation	2	29	“ ‘ “ Whoever has ears should listen to what the Spirit says to the Churches. ” ’ Footnotes - Revelation 2:1 Christian communities at the end of the first century found themselves faced with difficulties that were substantially the same as those faced by the Church in every age , from the Passover of Christ to the end of history . The real struggle was and would be that of fidelity in the midst of constant renewal . The letters here are addressed to seven Churches of Asia Minor ; the number seven is symbolic , in the sense that these communities represent all the Churches with their difficulties and problems , their efforts to be faithful , and their undertakings . Each letter follows the same pattern : Christ comes on the scene bearing one of the symbols listed in the great vision of Rev 1:9-20 ; he judges the communities according to their deficiencies , their fidelity , and their constancy ; then he concludes with the promise of final victory . In every age each community and each believer will read these letters in order to submit to the Lord ’ s judgment and to hear once again his call . Addressed as they are to angels who , according to the religious thinking of the time , were regarded as presiding over the destiny of a community , they envisage first of all the leaders of the communities . - Revelation 2:1 Under the pretext of Christian spirituality and freedom , a sect that , certainly without justification , claims reliance on one of the first deacons , Nicholas ( see Acts 6:5 ) , allows itself the most serious moral deviations and takes part very freely in pagan worship . ( A similar group at Pergamum holds the teaching of Balaam [ vv . 14-15 ] , and a third at Thyatira follows the woman Jezebel [ v.

White garments symbolize God ’ s righteousness , victory , and glory ( see Rev 3:18 ; 6:11 ; 7:9 , 13f ; 19:14 ) . The book of life is a reference to the divine register in which the names of the redeemed are written ( see Rev 13:8 ; 17:8 ; 20:12 ,

Christians who were loyal to Christ were continually threatened with being stripped of their citizenship in cities they inhabited , i.e. , having their names blotted out of the city ’ s register . Christ ’ s acknowledgment of them in heaven offers an eternal , safe citizenship in his eternal Kingdom ( see Mt 10:32 ; Lk 12:8 ) . - Revelation 3:7 The Messiah , Son of David—who holds all power over the lot of the People of God , according to the image of Isa 22:22—addresses himself to the community of Philadelphia . Like the Church of Smyrna , it was suffering persecution , but it remained faithful . The reward of those who are faithful is evoked in symbolic terms : they will live in God ’ s dwelling and meet God ; they will be members of Christ ’ s Body , bearing his name and sharing his lot . - Revelation 3:7 Philadelphia : the gateway to the central plateau in the province of Asia . The holy one , the true one : see Rev 6:10 and Isa 40:25 ; Hab 3:2-3 ; Mk 1:24 .

Hence , it is urged to change and become spiritually alive . From now on people must align themselves with Christ ( see Mt 10:32 ) . Those who truly follow Jesus will one day be clad in a white garment , which recalls the white garment worn by Jesus at the Transfiguration and Resurrection . It was the garment already being given at Baptism . - Revelation 3:1 Sardis : capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia , it was a wealthy and famous city . - Revelation 3:5 Those who are victorious are promised three things : (
NCB	Revelation	4	4	and
NCB	Revelation	4	1	Chr 24:1-9 , or to the twelve patriarchs plus the twelve apostles . They thus represent salvation history . - Revelation 4:6 The four living creatures represent the created world that reveals God ’ s goodness and power . Their many eyes symbolize the universal knowledge and providence of God . They continue to give glory to God through their work in creation . Their forms ( lion , ox , human , eagle ) represent what is noblest , strongest , wisest , and most agile in the created world . Ever since St. Irenaeus , Christian tradition had seen in them symbols of the evangelists Mark , Luke , Matthew , and John , respectively .
NCB	Revelation	4	2	At once I was caught up in the spirit , [ d ] and there in heaven I beheld a throne .
NCB	Revelation	4	3	Seated upon the throne was one whose appearance was similar to that of jasper and carnelian , and surrounding it was a rainbow that looked like an emerald .
NCB	Revelation	4	5	) , there is the prelude of events to come ( Rev 6:1—11:9 ) : it is the history of Israel , whose fall under the blows of the Roman armies is regarded as a judgment of God on his people . Then follow the trials and confrontations of the decisive moment ( Rev 12:1—20:15 ) : the nations come before us , slaves to the powers of evil that oppose the plan of God , who wants to save human beings . The Roman empire is certainly in the forefront . The Judgment will be even more terrible than that of Jerusalem if they remain hostile to Christ the Lord , to his Gospel , and to his Church . In any case , the great battle between God and the wicked powers will end with the extermination of these powers . Then , the drama can be resolved in the final accomplishment ( Rev 21:1—22:15 ) : God creates a new world reserved for his Elect . But must we read , in this succession of numberless visions , the sketches of a mysterious calendar , a succession of events to come ? The whole would then appears terribly supercharged , badly ordered , and—in a nutshell—incoherent . Doubtless , one can imagine that the elements of two different apocalypses—each redacted according to a similar movement—have been poorly coordinated , in a single book . But the author multiplies images and explanations to such an extent as to disconcert and baffle us . Yet , these events are described in such an ambiguous manner that they could be applied to all times . These things are always happening ; we should always be ready for the end . - Revelation 4:1 This is a view of history imparted by faith . The Book suggests it by immediately transporting us to the throne of God where the destinies of the universe are decided . Images are multiplied to suggest in advance and to represent the hidden meaning of history . This inaugural vision places the readers in the worship of God ; it confirms the role of Christ as Master of the history of the world . - Revelation 4:1 Emperors are entertained like gods and are thought to have power over the world ’ s destiny . The truth is far different . Who indeed can open the door of the true God ’ s dwelling and express the greatness of his life and plan ? Here are innumerable symbols orchestrated like a brilliant symphony . Everything is inaccessible greatness : the peace of the light , the dread of the All-powerful , the power that dominates the universe , the perfect knowledge of all things . All this is what is proclaimed in these images . Already present around God are the fathers , those great ancestors whose sacred history faith proclaims ( see Sir 44–50 ; Heb 10–12 ) ; for He is the God of the living and not of the dead , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , as Jesus attests in the Gospel ( see Mk 12:26-27 ) . The great manifestations ( or epiphanies ) of God depicted in the Old Testament are an invitation to adore God , and the author was inspired by them . We recognize the themes of Isaiah in the temple ( see Isa
NCB	Revelation	4	6	) and especially the images of Ezekiel ( see Ezek
NCB	Revelation	4	7	The first living creature resembled a lion , the second resembled an ox , the third had a human face , and the fourth resembled an eagle in flight .
NCB	Revelation	4	8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings , and all of them were covered with eyes all around and underneath their wings . Day and night they never stop saying : “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God , the Almighty , who was , and who is , and who is to come. ”
NCB	Revelation	4	9	And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
NCB	Revelation	4	10	) . In this way , the Jews were wont to express God ’ s domination over the universe . Thus , the sea , always felt to be a savage and hostile power , was itself tamed by the all-powerful God . All the forces of heaven that can be imagined—for example , those to which are attributed the government of the seasons and the rhythm of time , the four living creatures that represent the best of creation—are at the service of God . All these symbols form a great hymn to the Creator . - Revelation 4:2 In the spirit : see note on Rev 1:10 . - Revelation 4:4 The elders exercise a priestly and royal role : they praise and adore God , offer him the prayers of the faithful , assist him in governing the world , and share in his power . The number twenty-four corresponds perhaps to the twenty-four classes or divisions of priests in
NCB	Revelation	4	11	“ Worthy are you , O Lord our God , to receive glory and honor and power , for you created all things ; by your will they were created and have their being. ” Footnotes - Revelation 4:1 In antiquity , books took the form of large scrolls . Thus , the most important and difficult part of the Book of Revelation is presented to us as a well-sealed scroll ; the seals must be broken and , as they are , the visions unfold one after the other . In their main lines these visions intersect according to the classic plan of an apocalypse . After a grandiose inaugural vision ( chs .
NCB	Revelation	5	5	Then one of the elders said to me , “ Do not weep . The Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , has triumphed , and thus has won the right to open the scroll and its seven seals. ”
NCB	Revelation	5	1	Cor 6:20 ) .
NCB	Revelation	5	2	) . - Revelation 5:9 New song : a song that celebrates a new act of divine deliverance ( see Rev 14:3 ; Pss 33:3 ; 96:1 ; 144:9 ; Isa 42:10 ) . With your blood you purchased for God people : the theme of Christ ’ s sacrificial Death ( see Mk 10:45 ;
NCB	Revelation	5	3	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who was able to open the scroll and examine it .
NCB	Revelation	5	4	I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll and examine it .
NCB	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw , standing in the center of the throne , encircled by the four living creatures and the elders , a Lamb that had been slain . He had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the entire world .
NCB	Revelation	5	7	) , the Messiah King , shoot of the stock from which David was descended . It is Christ in the power of his Resurrection who receives the mastery over the destinies of the entire universe . He is represented in his glory after the manner of a Lamb slain but standing ( the figure of the Paschal Lamb is the main title for Christ in this Book , used twenty-eight times ) . This unusual expression is intended to recall Passover , the passover lamb , and the sacrificial Death of Christ for the redemption of the human race , but also to assert that he is ever living and the conqueror of death . The seven horns symbolize an infinite power . The one with infinite power is the Redeemer who has acquired the people by his Blood . The Creator ratifies this and places in Christ ’ s hands the succession of events until their fulfillment . Then the angels , the elders , and all the great figures in heaven that can be imagined will each come in turn to render the worship due to the Master of time , and the entire universe unites to acclaim the risen one . Indeed , the coming of Christ is a capital turning point , and a new song is required to celebrate it ( see Phil
NCB	Revelation	5	8	When he had taken the scroll , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the Lamb . Each of the elders was holding a harp , and they had gold bowls filled with incense , which are the prayers of the saints .
NCB	Revelation	5	9	They sang a new song : [ b ] “ You are worthy to receive the scroll and to open its seals , for you were slain , and with your blood you purchased for God people of every tribe and language , nation and race .
NCB	Revelation	5	10	; see also
NCB	Revelation	5	11	In my vision , I heard the voices of a multitude of angels who surrounded the throne and the living creatures and the elders . These angels numbered thousands upon thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand of them .
NCB	Revelation	5	12	And they cried out with a loud voice : “ Worthy is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive power and riches , wisdom and strength , honor and glory and praise. ”
NCB	Revelation	5	13	Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea , and all that is in them , saying : “ To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever. ”
NCB	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said , “ Amen , ” and the elders prostrated themselves in worship . Footnotes - Revelation 5:1 As we have seen , the whole universe sings of the limitless power of the Creator . But he is also the Master of the universe , and the book he holds in his hand represents the destiny of the world . The book is held closed by seven seals , i.e. , it contains the totality of the events of history , though in a hidden fashion , which no one can unveil . However , a mediator of the Revelation does exist . He is the Messiah , who is designated here by the titles foretold of him in the Old Testament : the lion of Judah ( see Gen 49:9 ) to whom victory is promised ( see Isa 11:1 ,
NCB	Revelation	6	6	Then I heard what sounded like a voice emanating from the midst of the four living creatures , saying , “ A quart of wheat costs a day ’ s wages , and three quarts of barley cost a day ’ s wages . But do not damage the olive oil or the wine. ”
NCB	Revelation	6	1	Enoch 47:4 ) . - Revelation 6:12 The cosmic destruction announces the Day of the Lord ( see Isa 34:4 ; Mk 13:6 , 24f ) . It is an astonishing spectacle that this firmament will be rolled up like a large scroll . The cosmos enters a phase of distortion and convulsion . The threat hangs over everyone ; no one escapes the paralyzing fear . The author uses to great advantage many of the images of the Old Testament ( see Isa 2:10 ,
NCB	Revelation	6	2	Esdras 4:35-37 ) and that the death of a certain number of the righteous must occur before the end takes place ( see
NCB	Revelation	6	3	When he broke open the second seal , I heard the second living creature shout , “ Come ! ”
NCB	Revelation	6	4	And another horse came forth ; it was red . Its rider was empowered to take away peace from the earth so that people would slay each other . He was given a large sword . [ c ]
NCB	Revelation	6	5	When he broke open the third seal , I heard the third living creature shout , “ Come ! ” I looked , and there was a black horse , and its rider was holding a pair of scales [ d ] in his hand .
NCB	Revelation	6	7	) . All the chapters that follow seem to interpret the history of the world in the perspective of the destiny reserved for the Jewish people . Yet the end of Jerusalem and its destruction are not the end of history ; they are only a turning point ( Rev 10:1—11:13 ) —then the time of the nations can truly begin ( Rev 12:1—19:10 ) . - Revelation 6:1 The first secrets are unveiled . Already the images are terrifying . The colors of the horses suffice to create fright . Three horsemen sow war , famine , and pestilence , those great scourges in which the ancients see God ’ s judgment on proud and indifferent ages and on unjust people ( see , e.g. , Lev 26:21-26 ; Deut 32:34 ; Ezek 5:17 ; 6:11f ; 7:14f ; 12:16 ; 14:13-21 ; 33:27 ; Jer 15:2-4 ; Mt 24:6f ) . Hades follows in the wake of the last horseman to swallow the victims into its gloomy abode . There is some doubt about the figure of the first horseman , crowned and mounted on a white horse . Is it Christ , or a false Messiah , or simply another scourge , the well-known scourge of the voracious beasts who decimate travelers ? The allegory of the four horses and horsemen who ride out into the four quarters of the world is taken from Zechariah ( 1:8-10 ; 6:1-8 ) . - Revelation 6:4 A large sword : symbol of war . - Revelation 6:5 Scales : symbol of hunger : food is rationed and sold at very high prices . The rider with the scales probably represents social injustice . A day ’ s wages : literally , “ a denarius. ” - Revelation 6:8 Hades : personification of the abode of the dead , i.e. , the netherworld ( see notes on Rev 1:9-20 and Mt 16:18 ) . - Revelation 6:9 Persecution is unleashed . The victims , as though immolated in sacrifice , are all reunited around God and already clothed in the garment of joy . This presence of the victims attests that oppression has been lifted on earth . For the people of the Bible possess too great a sense of justice to imagine that such violent injustices as persecutions constitute an indifferent thing in the eyes of God and that they can go unpunished forever . They are like a challenge to God ( see Lk 18:7 ) . God must intervene , and bloody persecutions are among the signs of the end ( see Mk 13:9-13 ) . - Revelation 6:10 Inhabitants of the earth : i.e. , humankind in its hostility to God ( see Rev 3:10 ; 8:13 ; 11:10 ; 13:8 ,
NCB	Revelation	6	8	) . Until the roll was completed of their fellow servants and brethren who were still to be killed : there was an apocalyptic idea in the air—sparked by noncanonical literature—that God rules the world according to a predetermined time schedule ( see
NCB	Revelation	6	9	When he broke open the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain on account of the word of God and for witnessing to it .
NCB	Revelation	6	10	They shouted in a loud voice , “ How long is it to be , holy and true Master , before you judge the inhabitants of the earth [ g ] and avenge our death ? ”
NCB	Revelation	6	11	Each of them was given a white robe , [ h ] and they were instructed to be patient for a little longer until the roll was completed of their fellow servants and brethren who were still to be killed as they themselves had been .

NCB	Revelation	6	13	and the stars in the sky fell to earth like unripe figs dislodged from a tree when shaken by a strong wind .
NCB	Revelation	6	14	The heavens were torn apart like a scroll being rolled up , and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place .
NCB	Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth , the nobles , and the commanders , the rich and the powerful , and the whole population , both slaves and free , hid themselves in caves and among the rocks of the mountains .
NCB	Revelation	6	16	They shouted to the mountains and the rocks , “ Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb .
NCB	Revelation	6	17	For the great day of their wrath has come , and who can endure it ? ” Footnotes - Revelation 6:1 The book of destiny is probably not a scroll in the classical sense . It is a document that is folded and then sealed , folded and sealed , etc. , seven times . It resembles a Roman legal document . Thus , as each seal is broken , part of the document becomes legible . When the seventh seal is broken ( Rev 8:1 ) , the hour is going to sound ; but we are still living in suspense : trumpets will sound , one after another until the seventh one ; then the great act will be played out ( Rev 11:15 ) . Nonetheless , the unfurling of the wrath is not described to frighten believers ; the author wants to strengthen them , to announce to them that the destiny of the world has been turned around and God ’ s plan is on the way to being fulfilled . In accord with the perspectives of the prophecies and the Gospel , a Remnant will be saved , the community of Christ and the true People of God ( Rev
NCB	Revelation	6	18	; 11:10 ; 13:8 ,
NCB	Revelation	6	19	; 34:4 ; Hos 10:8 ; Joel 2:11 ; 3:4 ) .
NCB	Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Levi , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Issachar , twelve thousand ,
NCB	Revelation	7	1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on land or on the sea or on any tree .
NCB	Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel rising from the east , bearing the seal of the living God . He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given the power to ravage the land and the sea ,
NCB	Revelation	7	3	“ Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees until we have set the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God. ”
NCB	Revelation	7	4	Then I heard how many had been marked with the seal—one hundred and forty-four thousand from all the tribes of Israel :
NCB	Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah , [ b ] twelve thousand , from the tribe of Reuben , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Gad , twelve thousand ,
NCB	Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Naphtali , twelve thousand , from the tribe of Manasseh , twelve thousand ,
NCB	Revelation	7	8	) —doubtless in order to make up twelve tribes . Daniel is omitted probably because of a late tradition that the Antichrist was to arise from that tribe . - Revelation 7:17 Springs of living water : i.e. , the grace of God , which flows from Christ ( see Rev 21:6 ; 22:1 ,
NCB	Revelation	7	9	) . The great fear is not for the community of the persecuted . The calamities that will overtake the world will not touch them . Thus , God gathers together his Elect . They may go through the trial of the years A.D.
NCB	Revelation	7	10	They cried out in a loud voice : “ Salvation belongs to our God , who sits on the throne , and to the Lamb. ”
NCB	Revelation	7	11	All the angels who were standing around the throne , and around the elders and the four living creatures , prostrated themselves before the throne and worshiped God ,
NCB	Revelation	7	12	saying : “ Amen . Praise and glory , wisdom and thanksgiving , honor and power and might , be to our God forever and ever . Amen. ”
NCB	Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders spoke to me and inquired , “ Who are these people , all dressed in white robes , and where have they come from ? ”
NCB	Revelation	7	14	) .
NCB	Revelation	7	15	“ That is why they stand before the throne of God and worship him day and night in his temple , and the one who sits on the throne will shelter them .
NCB	Revelation	7	16	They will never again experience hunger or thirst , nor will the sun or any scorching heat cause them discomfort .
NCB	Revelation	7	17	; Jn 4:10 ,
NCB	Revelation	7	587	B.C. , on the eve of the destruction of Jerusalem , the survivors were , so to speak , marked to be preserved from the catastrophe ( see Ezek
NCB	Revelation	7	66	to
NCB	Revelation	7	70	and finally the history of the world , which is that of the sufferings of the Church . But they will not fall prey to condemnation . This people that is gathered together is first of all the Remnant of Israel . From each of the twelve tribes there will be twelve thousand survivors : this is a symbolic number meaning fullness and perfection . Then the vision is enlarged : the Remnant becomes a multitude without number , gathered together from amid all the nations of the earth . From all sides come forth the martyrs and all those who endured trials : the whole Church . This is a grandiose celebration of happiness and triumph . In a striking foreshortening , the author sketches a tableau of the Church in the grip of tribulations and persecutions , assisted by Christ , her Shepherd , and led toward her heavenly victory , which anticipates the splendid final vision of the new Jerusalem ( Rev 21:1—22:5 ) . - Revelation 7:5 Judah is placed first because of Christ , who is “ the Lion of the tribe of Judah ” ( Rev 5:5 ) . Manasseh : one of the two halves of the tribe of Joseph that are both cited ( the other being Ephraim but called “ Joseph ” in v.
NCB	Revelation	8	8	[ e ] When the second angel blew his trumpet , something that looked like a huge mountain ablaze with fire was hurled into the sea . A third of the sea turned into blood ,
NCB	Revelation	8	1	Thes 4:16 ) , seven tableaus will pass before our eyes in a dramatization without letup . - Revelation 8:3 The altar is the altar of incense in the Jewish sanctuary ; the gold censer is the thurible or fire-shovel used to carry the burning coals from the altar of holocausts to the altar of incense . - Revelation 8:7 The earth , sea , streams , sources , and stars—everything is disfigured . The universe becomes chaos and lays itself waste . The author amplifies images taken from the Book of Exodus ( chs . 7–10 ) . - Revelation 8:7 See the seventh plague of Egypt ( Ex 9:23f ) and Joel 3:3 . - Revelation 8:8 See the first plague of Egypt ( Ex 7:20f ) . - Revelation 8:11 Wormwood : a bitter-tasting plant that is a metaphor for calamity , sorrow , and death ( see Prov 5:3f ; Jer 9:15 ; Lam 3:19 ) . - Revelation 8:12 See the darkness that occurred for three days during the ninth plague of Egypt ( Ex 10:21-23 ) . - Revelation 8:13 After the universe , the human race will itself be struck . The eagle announces the three calamities .
NCB	Revelation	8	2	And I saw that seven trumpets were given to the seven angels who stand in the presence of God .
NCB	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came forward with a gold censer and stood at the altar . [ b ] He was given a large quantity of incense to offer , with the prayers of all the saints , on the gold altar that stood before the throne .
NCB	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense together with the prayers of the saints rose before God from the hand of the angel .
NCB	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer , filled it with fire from the altar , and emptied it upon the earth . Immediately , there came peals of thunder , rumblings , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake .
NCB	Revelation	8	6	The seven angels who held the seven trumpets now made ready to blow them . The First Four Trumpets . [ c ]
NCB	Revelation	8	7	When the first angel blew his trumpet , there was a storm of hail and fire , mixed with blood , and it fell upon the earth . [ d ] A third of the earth was burned up , as well as a third of the trees and all the green grass .
NCB	Revelation	8	9	a third of the creatures living in the sea died , and a third of the ships were destroyed .
NCB	Revelation	8	10	When the third angel blew his trumpet , a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch . It came down on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water .
NCB	Revelation	8	11	This star was called “ Wormwood , ” and a third of the waters turned to wormwood . [ f ] Great numbers of people died from the waters that had become bitter .
NCB	Revelation	8	12	When the fourth angel blew his trumpet , a third of the sun was struck , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars . As a result , a third of their light was darkened , and the day lost its illumination for a third of the time , and so did the night . [ g ]
NCB	Revelation	8	13	The Cry of the Eagle . [ h ] In my vision , I heard an eagle cry out in a loud voice as it flew high overhead , “ Woe ! Woe ! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the other trumpet blasts that the three angels have not yet blown ! ” Footnotes - Revelation 8:1 We are now at the great Day of God ’ s Coming . Everything is unmoving in a solemn silence . It is the hour when the prayer of those persecuted—which is symbolized by the incense—is going to be heard ( see Rev 6:9-11 ) . Calamities arise to jostle the earth . At the sound of the trumpets , which are part of the scene for the Coming of God ( see
NCB	Revelation	9	9	and their chests were like iron breastplates . The sound of their wings was like the rumble of many horses and chariots rushing into battle .
NCB	Revelation	9	1	Cor 10:20 ) .
NCB	Revelation	9	2	When he unlocked the shaft of the abyss , smoke rose up from the abyss like smoke from a huge furnace , so that the sun and the sky were darkened by the smoke from the abyss .
NCB	Revelation	9	3	And out of the smoke locusts dropped down onto the earth , and they were given the same powers that scorpions have on the earth .
NCB	Revelation	9	4	They were commanded not to damage the grass or the earth or any plant or tree , and they were told to attack only those people who did not have God ’ s seal on their foreheads .
NCB	Revelation	9	5	They were given permission to torture these people for five months , but they were not allowed to kill them , and the torment they were to inflict was to be like that of a scorpion when it stings someone .
NCB	Revelation	9	6	. - Revelation 9:13 These ancient monsters seem to have had an appointment to meet on the banks of the Euphrates , to be then unleashed as a savage horde on the people . The visionary is undoubtedly thinking of the four corps of the military that invaded Judea from Syria for the second phase of the Jewish War in an expedition that was particularly destructive and murderous . The event was always supposed to be a sign that jump-started consciences . Alas , it merely leads to bewilderment and decomposition ! - Revelation 9:13 I heard a voice : to show that the punishment inflicted on the pagans was the result of the prayer of the martyrs , described in Rev 6:9-10 . - Revelation 9:15 For the day of the divine wrath , see Rev 6:17 . - Revelation 9:20 Demons : spiritual beings allied with Satan and wielding an evil influence on human beings ( see Deut 4:28 ; Ps 115:5-7 ;
NCB	Revelation	9	7	In appearance the locusts were like horses equipped for battle . On their heads they wore what appeared to be gold crowns . Their faces were like human faces ,
NCB	Revelation	9	8	and their hair was like women ’ s hair . Their teeth were like lions ’ teeth ,
NCB	Revelation	9	10	These locusts had tails and stings like those of scorpions , and in their tails they had the power to torment people for five months .
NCB	Revelation	9	11	They had as their king the angel of the abyss , whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon , and in Greek , Apollyon .
NCB	Revelation	9	12	The first woe has passed , but two more are still to come .
NCB	Revelation	9	13	The Sixth Trumpet : the Second Woe . [ b ] Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet , and I heard a voice [ c ] emanating from the horns of the gold altar that stood in the presence of God .
NCB	Revelation	9	14	It said to the sixth angel who was holding the trumpet , “ Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates. ”
NCB	Revelation	9	15	And so the four angels , who had been held in readiness for this very hour , day , month , and year , were released to kill a third of mankind . [ d ]
NCB	Revelation	9	16	The number of their cavalry troops was two hundred million . This was the number I heard .
NCB	Revelation	9	17	This is how I saw the horses and their riders in my vision . The riders wore breastplates in shades of red , blue , and yellow . The heads of the horses were like heads of lions , and issuing forth from their mouths were fire , smoke , and sulfur .
NCB	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues of fire , smoke , and sulfur that poured forth from their mouths , a third of mankind was killed .
NCB	Revelation	9	19	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails . Their tails were like serpents , with heads that inflicted harm .
NCB	Revelation	9	20	However , the rest of mankind who survived these plagues did not repent of the work of their hands or cease their worship of demons [ e ] and of idols of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood , which can neither see nor hear nor walk .
NCB	Revelation	9	21	Nor did they repent of their murders , their sorcery , their sexual immorality , or their thefts . Footnotes - Revelation 9:1 A fallen star , doubtless Satan himself , opens the door of the abyss , which is regarded as the prison in which the evil spirits are held while awaiting their final punishment . An army of strange locusts escapes ( see the eighth and ninth plagues of Egypt—Ex 10:12-15 , 21-23—as well as the invasion of locusts in Joel 1:4—2:10 ) . These do not devour the harvest , as one would expect , but attack humans . It is an invasion of a fierce army , led by a satanic being , whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon , meaning perdition or ruin , and in Greek Apollyon , meaning destroyer . The writer has not resisted the enticing pleasure of giving this being a name that is a caricature of the great Greek god Apollo . Job 3:21 is cited in v.
NCB	Revelation	10	10	I took the small scroll from the angel ’ s hand and ate it . In my mouth it did taste as sweet as honey , but when I had eaten it my stomach turned sour .
NCB	Revelation	10	1	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven . He was wrapped in a cloud , with a rainbow over his head . His face was like the sun , his legs were like pillars of fire ,
NCB	Revelation	10	2	Thes 2:6-12 ) and the Kingdom of God is established and all creation is renewed ( see Rev 21:1—22:5 ) .
NCB	Revelation	10	3	the angel gave forth a great shout like the roar of a lion . And when he shouted , the seven thunders spoke .
NCB	Revelation	10	4	After the seven thunders had spoken , I was preparing to write when I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken , but do not write it down. ”
NCB	Revelation	10	5	Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
NCB	Revelation	10	6	and swore by him who lives forever and ever and who created heaven and earth and the sea and everything that is in them : “ There will be no further delay .
NCB	Revelation	10	7	When the time comes for the seventh angel to sound his trumpet , the mysterious purpose of God [ b ] will be fulfilled , just as he announced to his servants the Prophets. ”
NCB	Revelation	10	8	Then I again heard the voice that had spoken to me from heaven , and it said , “ Go and take that open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land. ”
NCB	Revelation	10	9	Therefore , I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll . He replied , “ Take it and eat it . It will turn your stomach sour , but in your mouth it will taste as sweet as honey. ”
NCB	Revelation	10	11	Then I was told , “ You must prophesy once again about many peoples , nations , languages , and kings. ” Footnotes - Revelation 10:1 The large scroll , whose seven seals are being broken one after another , is said to contain the entire History of Salvation , which unfolds from Christ ’ s Death and Resurrection to the day of the final judgment . This history is brought to mind from the viewpoint of the destiny of the Jewish people , but the last episode in this history includes the judgment and salvation of the nations , which are here set forth . An angel brings forth and unrolls another text ; the messenger dominates heaven and the sea , i.e. , his announcement concerns the whole universe . The scroll that the angel is holding here contains the story of clashes between the Church and the forces that control the pagan world . It is a small scroll , because the events told in it are connected with the history of Israel , in which the end of Jerusalem introduces the era of the nations . There will be no more delay . Everything remains secret , yet everything will be played out between the sixth and the seventh trumpet . The scene of the scroll that is eaten was inspired by an account of Ezekiel ( 2:8—3:3 ) . The revelation is sweet and bitter : sweet because it is a word of salvation and makes known the final triumph of Christ and his faithful ; bitter because it announces the trials and tribulations that in so many texts of the Bible precede the judgment of God . The Gospel speaks of the joy of the woman giving birth in sorrow ( Jn 16:21 ) . - Revelation 10:7 The mysterious purpose of God : literally , “ the mystery of God , ” i.e. , the end of the present age when the power of evil will be overcome ( see Rev 17:1—19:4 , 11-21 ; 20:7-10 ; Rom 16:25f ;
NCB	Revelation	11	11	) and one of whom changed water into blood ( Ex 7:17 ; 10:11 ) , while the other predicted a drought (
NCB	Revelation	11	1	Kgs 17:1 ) . The Gospel places both at the side of Christ during the Transfiguration ( Mk 9:2-8 ) . Next come two mysterious personalities who , according to Zechariah ( 4:3 ,
NCB	Revelation	11	2	Ki 25:8-10 ) . The New Testament writers use it to symbolize God ’ s faithfulness to the Covenant made with his people .
NCB	Revelation	11	3	I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for those twelve hundred and sixty days , wearing sackcloth. ”
NCB	Revelation	11	4	of our text , represent the priesthood and the Kingdom uniting their efforts to guide the people of God . These are also Christian figures , of Christ first and then of the apostles—tradition names Peter and Paul , the two champions of the early Church , who died at Rome under Nero in A.D.
NCB	Revelation	11	5	If anyone tries to harm them , fire pours forth from their mouths and consumes their enemies . Anyone who attempts to harm them will surely be killed in this manner .
NCB	Revelation	11	6	They have the power to shut up the sky so that it does not rain during the time they are prophesying . They also have the power to turn water into blood and to afflict the earth with every type of plague as often as they desire .
NCB	Revelation	11	7	( see Dan 7:21 ) represents the imperial power , destructive power , that claimed to be divine . Speaking of survivors ( v.
NCB	Revelation	11	8	Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city , known by the symbolic names of Sodom and Egypt , where their Lord was crucified .
NCB	Revelation	11	9	) , i.e. , the testimony of the martyr Church can not disappear into oblivion . Just as the dry bones of the people of the Old Testament came to life in the eyes of the Prophet Ezekiel ( 37:5 ,
NCB	Revelation	11	10	) , so the Christian martyrs are destined for resurrection and glorification . The great city is symbolic of the high places of infidelity according to the Bible . In Rev 16:19 ; 17:18 ; 18:10 , it is Rome ; here , it is Rome or Jerusalem or any other city that makes itself omnipotent . The beast cited in v.
NCB	Revelation	11	12	Then I heard a loud voice from heaven say to them , “ Come up here , ” and while their enemies were watching , they went up to heaven in a cloud .
NCB	Revelation	11	13	) , the author thinks , perhaps , as did Paul ( Rom 11:13-27 ) , of a conversion of the Jewish people preceding Christ ’ s Return . - Revelation 11:2 Forty-two months . . . twelve hundred and sixty days . . . three and a half days . . . a year , two years , and a half year ( 12:14 ) : symbolic durations , designating typical periods of persecution according to Dan 7:25 . - Revelation 11:15 The seventh trumpet sounds to announce the definitive restoration of the Kingdom of God and Christ . With the resurrection of the dead , Israel sees the completion of its promises of salvation : there will be reward for true worshipers and condemnation for rebels . The thanksgiving of the elders can rise before the throne of God . According to a Jewish tradition , allusions to which are found in the Second Book of Maccabees ( 2:5-8 ) , the Ark of the Covenant , which was destroyed by the fire in the temple in
NCB	Revelation	11	14	) cited in v.
NCB	Revelation	11	15	The Seventh Trumpet : the Third Woe . [ c ] The seventh angel blew his trumpet , and voices in heaven were heard crying loudly : “ The kingdom of the world belongs to our Lord and his Messiah , and he will reign forever and ever. ”
NCB	Revelation	11	16	Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones in the presence of God prostrated themselves and worshiped God ,
NCB	Revelation	11	17	saying : “ We give you thanks , Lord God Almighty , who are and who were . For you have taken your great power and have begun to reign .
NCB	Revelation	11	18	The nations rose in rage , but now your wrath has come . It is the time for judging the dead and for rewarding your servants the Prophets , as well as the saints who revere your name , both small and great , and for destroying those who destroy the earth. ”
NCB	Revelation	11	19	Then God ’ s temple in heaven was opened , and the ark of his covenant [ d ] was seen within his temple . There followed flashes of lightning , rumblings , peals of thunder , an earthquake , and a violent hailstorm . Footnotes - Revelation 11:1 The holy city is crushed under the blows of Titus , but in the Church , the new Israel , everything that the temple , the altar , and the worshipers represent will not cease ; true worship will continue . In a hostile world , the witnesses of Christ will continue to spread the Word of God , despite persecutions , until the Second Coming . Let us try to see a bit more clearly into the details of the symbols used by the author to impart this certitude to believers subjected to torture . Measuring Jerusalem calls to mind—since Ezekiel ( 40:3 ) and Zechariah ( 2:5-6 ) —protection and reconstruction . But only the reserved part of the temple is spared , i.e. , while the Church will be persecuted and even give forth martyrs , the saints will never be harmed . While the bodies of the holy ones ( represented by the exterior of the temple ) are crushed , their souls ( represented by the interior of the temple ) are safe in God ’ s hands . The two witnesses—perhaps Peter and Paul—combine the traits of several persons , especially Moses and Elijah ( of whom Judaism of that time mentions the ascension : v.
NCB	Revelation	11	64	or
NCB	Revelation	11	67	. Finally , these mysterious figures stand for the whole Church bearing witness to her faith and suffering for the sake of the Gospel even until martyrdom . It is not permitted to put their bones in the grave ( v.
NCB	Revelation	11	587	B.C. , was to reappear in the last times ; the hour for this has come . A new Sinai arises in heaven forever . The hour of judgment is , in the final analysis , the judgment of the definitive and perfect Covenant . Certainly , the earthly temple is destroyed , but the true and complete worship takes place in heaven . - Revelation 11:19 Ark of his covenant : the ark of the Old Testament was a chest of acacia wood ( see Deut 10:1f ) that symbolized God ’ s throne and his presence among his people . It was probably destroyed during Neburazadan ’ s destruction of the temple in Jerusalem ( see
NCB	Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice , you heavens , and you who dwell in them ! But woe to you , earth and sea , because the devil has come down to you . He is filled with rage , for he knows that his time is short. ”
NCB	Revelation	12	2	She was with child and about to give birth , crying aloud in the anguish of her labor .
NCB	Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven : a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns , and seven diadems crowning his heads .
NCB	Revelation	12	4	, citing Dan 8:10 ) . The dragon is Satan , the eternal accuser of human beings before God ( see Job 1:6-11 ; 2:1-10 ) . After this “ the rest of her [ the woman ’ s ] offspring ” ( v .
NCB	Revelation	12	5	, which cites some classic Messianic texts : Isa 66:7 and Ps 2:9 . A long-standing Christian tradition also identifies the woman with the Virgin Mary , an exemplar of the chosen people . Modern exegetes rarely support so explicit an interpretation , but do not deny that the role of the one called “ woman ” in the fourth Gospel ( Jn 2:4 ; 19:26 ) may have indirectly inspired , at least partially , this description in the Book of Revelation . The dragon ( see Dan
NCB	Revelation	12	6	) , an evident reference to the Eucharist . Hell can launch against the Church all the forces unleashed by the Roman political authorities . In this scene there is also a struggle between Michael and the dragon ( v.
NCB	Revelation	12	7	) , which illustrates the victory of Christ ; the description draws its inspiration from the Book of Daniel . - Revelation 12:6 Twelve hundred and sixty days : see note on Rev 11:2-3 ,
NCB	Revelation	12	8	but they were defeated , and they lost their place in heaven .
NCB	Revelation	12	9	The great dragon—the ancient serpent who is called the devil , or Satan , the deceiver of the whole world—was hurled down to earth , and his angels were cast down with him .
NCB	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say : “ Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Messiah . For the accuser [ e ] of our brethren has been cast out , the one who accused them day and night before our God .
NCB	Revelation	12	11	. - Revelation 12:7 Michael : i.e. , God ’ s champion according to Jewish tradition ( see Dan 10:12-21 ; 12:1 ) ; his name means “ Who can compare with God ? ” - Revelation 12:10 Accuser : the translation for the Hebrew word “ Satan ” ( see
NCB	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon realized that he had been hurled down to earth , he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child .
NCB	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she could fly away from the serpent into the wilderness , to the place where she was to be looked after for a year , two years , and a half year . [ f ]
NCB	Revelation	12	15	Then from his mouth the serpent spewed out water like a river after the woman to sweep her away with the flood .
NCB	Revelation	12	16	However , the earth came to the rescue of the woman : it opened its mouth and swallowed the river spewed from the dragon ’ s mouth .
NCB	Revelation	12	17	) —i.e. , the faithful followers of Christ—suffer a period of struggles and trials in “ the wilderness ” ( v.
NCB	Revelation	12	18	to the preceding paragraph .
NCB	Revelation	12	1	Chr 21:1 ; Job 1–2 ; Zec 3:1 ) . In Hebrew scripture , Satan is a type of district attorney who accuses people of their sins at the Last Judgment . - Revelation 12:14 A year , two years , and a half year : see note on Rev 11:2 . - Revelation 12:18 This beast that is possessed of extraordinary power ( seven heads and ten horns ) personifies the Roman empire . Its historical success is a blasphemous parody of the Christian mystery ; the emperors have themselves acclaimed with divine titles , while for Christians only God and the Lamb have a right to the title “ Lord ” ( Kyrios ) . The head that was wounded and then healed probably refers to Nero who was forced to commit suicide ( by pushing a sword into his head ) and was said to have risen from the dead ( again , a blasphemous parody of Jesus ’ Death and Resurrection ) . - Revelation 12:18 I took my position . . . : another translation is : “ he took his position . . . ” —which would join v.
NCB	Revelation	13	13	It performed great signs , even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of all .
NCB	Revelation	13	1	Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea . It had ten horns and seven heads . On its horns were ten diadems , and on its heads were blasphemous names .
NCB	Revelation	13	2	The beast that I saw resembled a leopard , but it had feet like those of a bear , and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion . The dragon conferred on the beast his own power and his throne , as well as great authority .
NCB	Revelation	13	3	One of his heads appeared to me to have been mortally wounded , but its mortal wound had been healed . The whole world then became fascinated with the beast ,
NCB	Revelation	13	4	and they worshiped the dragon because he had conferred authority on the beast . They also worshiped the beast , saying , “ Who can compare with the beast ? Who can fight against it ? ”
NCB	Revelation	13	5	It was allowed to mouth its haughty and blasphemous words , and it was granted permission to exercise its authority for forty-two months . [ a ]
NCB	Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God , as well as against his name and his dwelling and all those who live in heaven .
NCB	Revelation	13	7	The beast was also allowed to wage war on the saints and conquer them , and it was given authority over every tribe , people , language , and nation .
NCB	Revelation	13	8	All the inhabitants of the earth will worship it , all those whose names have not been written from the creation of the world [ b ] in the book of life belonging to the Lamb who was slain .
NCB	Revelation	13	9	Whoever has ears should listen to these words :
NCB	Revelation	13	10	“ If anyone is to go into captivity , into captivity he will go . If anyone is destined to be slain by the sword , by the sword he must be slain. ” This demands patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints .
NCB	Revelation	13	11	. - Revelation 13:8 Written from the creation of the world : some place these words at the very end of the sentence ( after the word “ slain ” ) . Book of life belonging to the Lamb : see note on Rev 3:5 . - Revelation 13:11 The beast comes probably from Asia , because it was the East that gave rise to so many religious currents of thought that promoted emperor worship . The time has come when pressures are brought to bear and people are seduced . This picture fits in very well with the reign of Domitian , who banished Christians from the empire for refusing to practice emperor worship , the new sign of civic submission . The majority of believers resist , despite pressures and seductions of every kind . The number of the beast has always been a snare for those who seek , by way of abstruse calculations , to identify the Antichrist with some figure of their own time . The number probably conceals the name of some personage known to readers of that time ; the letters of the Greek alphabet and those of the Hebrew alphabet also stood for numbers , as is still the case with the Roman alphabet to some extent . Using gematria , a procedure for interpreting numbers , it was certainly possible to discern in the number
NCB	Revelation	13	12	It wielded all the authority of the first beast on its behalf , and it forced the earth and all its inhabitants to worship the first beast , whose mortal wound had been healed .
NCB	Revelation	13	14	By the signs it was allowed to perform on behalf of the beast , it deceived the inhabitants of the earth , persuading them to erect an image for the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet lived .
NCB	Revelation	13	15	It was permitted to give life to the beast ’ s image so that it could even speak and cause all those to be put to death who would not worship the image of the beast .
NCB	Revelation	13	16	It also forced all the people , both small and great , both rich and poor , both free and slave , to be branded on the right hand or on the forehead .
NCB	Revelation	13	17	No one could buy or sell anything except one who has been branded with the name of the beast or with the number of its name .
NCB	Revelation	13	18	There is wisdom here . Let anyone who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a person . The number is six hundred and sixty-six . Footnotes - Revelation 13:5 Forty-two months : see note on Rev 11:2-3 ,

NCB	Revelation	14	1	Cor 15:20 ) . The author of this Book regards believers as choice offerings to God and the Lamb . - Revelation 14:6 In the Old Testament , Babylon had become a symbol of every empire that was hostile to the People of God . - Revelation 14:10 Cup of his wrath : the Old Testament commonly portrays the wrath of God by a cup of wine to be drunk ( see Ps 75:9 ; Isa 51:17 ; Jer 25:15 ) . Burning sulfur : this figured prominently in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah ( see Gen 19:24 ) , and Ps 11:6 speaks of a similar fate awaiting the wicked . The figure is also found elsewhere in the Old Testament and in the final chapters of Rev ( 19:20 ; 20:10 ; 21:8 ) . - Revelation 14:13 Blessed : the second beatitude ( see note on Rev 1:3 ) . - Revelation 14:14 “ You will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven , ” Jesus had declared in the presence of the high priest who condemned him ( Mk 14:62 , inspired by Dan 7:13 ) . The Judgment is near ; the time of vintage and harvest is its classic image in the Bible , evoking the reaping or storing of fruits as well as the harsh plundering of the terrain and the relentless gathering of the produce . The winepress , in which the grapes are crushed , is an image of a battle aimed at savage extermination ( see Isa 63:2-3 ) ; as such , it yields blood and not juice . Here the entire earth is involved ; the two hundred miles , literally , “

Follow the Lamb : as disciples ( see Mt 19:21 ; Mk 8:34 ) . Firstfruits : a word used to refer to the first converts in a region ( see Rom 16:5 ) and the first to rise from the dead ( see
NCB	Revelation	14	3	They were singing a new song [ c ] before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn this song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth .
NCB	Revelation	14	4	x
NCB	Revelation	14	5	No lie was found on their lips . They are irreproachable . The Nearness of the Judgment . [ e ]
NCB	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying in midair , with an eternal gospel to proclaim to all those who live on the earth , to every nation , race , language , and people .
NCB	Revelation	14	7	He said in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him glory , for the time has come for his judgment . Worship him who made heaven and earth , the sea and the springs of water. ”
NCB	Revelation	14	8	A second angel followed him , saying : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great . She has made all the nations drink the wine of the wrath of her immorality. ”
NCB	Revelation	14	9	A third angel followed them , crying out in a loud voice , “ Anyone who worships the beast or its image and receives its mark on his forehead or hand
NCB	Revelation	14	10	will also drink the wine of God ’ s wrath , poured undiluted into the cup of his wrath . [ f ] Such people will be tormented in burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb .
NCB	Revelation	14	11	The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever . There will be no respite day or night for those who worship the beast or its image or for those who receive the mark of its name. ”
NCB	Revelation	14	12	This demands patient endurance on the part of the saints who keep the commandments of God and remain faithful to Jesus .
NCB	Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Write : Blessed [ g ] are those who die in the Lord from now on. ” “ Yes , ” says the Spirit , “ they will find rest from their labors , for their deeds go with them. ”
NCB	Revelation	14	15	Another angel then came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud , “ Use your sickle and reap , for the time to reap has come , because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe. ”
NCB	Revelation	14	16	So the one who was seated on the cloud swept over the earth with his sickle , and the earth was harvested .
NCB	Revelation	14	17	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven , and he , too , had a sharp sickle .
NCB	Revelation	14	18	Then from the altar came forth still another angel who was in charge of the fire , and he cried out in a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , “ Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vines of the earth , for her grapes are ripe. ”
NCB	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered in its vintage , which he then cast into the great winepress of God ’ s wrath .
NCB	Revelation	14	20	The winepress was trodden outside the city , and blood flowed from the winepress to the height of a horse ’ s bridle for a distance of two hundred miles . Footnotes - Revelation 14:1 The great hopes of the Prophets ( e.g. , Isa 2:1-5 ) are here realized ; the new chosen people , in a full and perfect number , gather at Zion , the mount of definitive encounter with God . The martyrs sing the new song of deliverance and victory ( see Ex 15:1-18 ; Pss 33:1-3 ; 98:1 ) . It expresses the virginal joy of those who have remained faithful to God , those who have not committed falsehood , adultery , and fornication—i.e. , in the language of the Bible , those who have not succumbed to the worship of false gods . They have not followed the emperor but only Christ . They have been , as it were , espoused to Christ ( see Rev 19:9 ; 21:2 ;
NCB	Revelation	14	1600	stadia ” (
NCB	Revelation	14	100	) , indicate this universality . The Judgment takes place outside Jerusalem—the author wants to indicate that those condemned are excluded from the assembly united around God . - Revelation 14:14 Son of man : see note on Mt 8:20 .
NCB	Revelation	15	15	The Seven Angels and the Seven Plagues . [ a ]
NCB	Revelation	15	1	Ki 8:10 ) we here contemplate the true temple of heaven , the manifestation of God . It is a description of the Judgment .
NCB	Revelation	15	2	I saw something that looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire . Standing beside the sea of glass and holding the harps that God had given them were those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name . They were holding harps given them by God
NCB	Revelation	15	3	and singing the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ How great and wonderful are your works , Lord God Almighty ! Just and true are your ways , O King of the nations !
NCB	Revelation	15	4	Who shall not fear you , O Lord , and bring glory to your name ? For you alone are holy . All nations will come and worship before you , for your acts of justice have been revealed. ” The Justice and Triumph of God [ c ] Vision of the Temple .
NCB	Revelation	15	5	After this , in my vision , the temple , that is , the tabernacle of the Testimony , [ d ] was opened in heaven ,
NCB	Revelation	15	6	and from the temple emerged the seven angels with the seven plagues . They were robed in clean , shining linen , and breastplates of gold were fastened around their chests .
NCB	Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
NCB	Revelation	15	8	The temple was filled with the smoke from the glory of God and from his power , so that no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed . Footnotes - Revelation 15:1 These constitute the decisive sign of the Judgment , whose execution will be set forth later . - Revelation 15:2 Those who have resisted are like the Hebrews after their crossing of the Red Sea . Here the mass of water , so terrifying to the ancients , seems marvelously tamed . It is the turn of the martyrs to chant the song of liberation ( see Ex 15:1-8 ) , playing on instruments far superior to any earthly musical instruments . - Revelation 15:5 Will heaven be mute in the presence of oppression by political authorities or by a civilization that turns human beings into slaves and claims to pass as God ? Are the sufferings and martyrdom of victims a cry that is perhaps useless and fades away in the history of the world ? The conscience of believers protests against this possibility . But it is necessary to determine in what God ’ s Judgment consists : it will unmask the imposture and recognize the courage of those who have resisted this perversion . Here some scenes of this Judgment flash before our eyes . - Revelation 15:5 The temple , that is , the tabernacle of the Testimony : i.e. , the heavenly sanctuary . The phrase conflates the tabernacle of Moses and the temple of Solomon . The Old Testament had described in blazing images the God who mysteriously took possession of the temple . In the same images ( see
NCB	Revelation	16	16	These spirits then assembled the kings at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon . [ g ]
NCB	Revelation	16	1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple say to the seven angels , “ Go forth and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God. ”
NCB	Revelation	16	2	Chr 35:20-24 ) ; it symbolized the final defeat of the powers of evil .
NCB	Revelation	16	3	[ c ] The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea . It turned to blood , like the blood of a dead person , and every living thing in the sea died .
NCB	Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water , and they turned to blood .
NCB	Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say : “ You are just , O Holy One , who are and who were , in these your judgments .
NCB	Revelation	16	6	For they have shed the blood of the saints and the Prophets , and you have given them blood to drink , as they deserve. ”
NCB	Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar respond : “ Yes , Lord God Almighty , true and just are your judgments. ”
NCB	Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun , and the sun was allowed to burn people with its flames .
NCB	Revelation	16	9	They were scorched by the fierce heat , and they cursed the name of God who had the power to inflict those plagues , but they refused to repent and pay him homage .
NCB	Revelation	16	10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and its kingdom was plunged into darkness . [ d ] People gnawed their tongues in agony
NCB	Revelation	16	11	and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores , instead of repenting for what they had done .
NCB	Revelation	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates , and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East .
NCB	Revelation	16	13	I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [ e ] come forth from the mouth of the dragon , from the mouth of the beast , and from the mouth of the false prophet .
NCB	Revelation	16	14	These are demonic spirits with the power to work miracles . They were sent to the kings of the entire world to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty .
NCB	Revelation	16	15	[ f ] “ Behold , I am coming like a thief ! Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes close by so that he will not have to go naked and be exposed to shame. ”
NCB	Revelation	16	17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air , and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne , saying , “ It is done ! ”
NCB	Revelation	16	18	. Blessed : the third beatitude ( see note on Rev 1:3 ) . - Revelation 16:16 Armageddon : i.e. , the “ mountain of Megiddo , ” the site of many battles in antiquity ( see Jdg 5:19f ;
NCB	Revelation	16	19	The great city was split into three parts , and the cities of the nations collapsed in ruin . Babylon the Great was also remembered by God , as he made her drink the cup filled with the wine of his fury and wrath .
NCB	Revelation	16	20	Every island vanished , and no mountains were to be found .
NCB	Revelation	16	21	Huge hailstones , each weighing about one hundred pounds , fell from the sky on the people , and they cursed God on account of the plague of hail that turned out to be so terrible . Footnotes - Revelation 16:1 The story of the plagues in Egypt ( Ex 7–12 ) remained deeply inscribed in the imagination of the Jews ; once again , as in chapters 8–10 ( vision of the trumpets ) , that story here inspires the description of the final cataclysm of the universe and of the lives of its peoples and nations . The desolating picture shows all the hostile forces united at Armageddon ( the Megiddo of the Bible , where King Josiah died with his troops ) ; it became a place of sinister memory , and an omen and symbol of military defeat and even annihilation ( see
NCB	Revelation	17	17	“ For God has influenced their hearts to carry out his purpose by agreeing to confer their royal powers upon the beast until the words of God will be fulfilled .
NCB	Revelation	17	1	Tim 6:15 ) .
NCB	Revelation	17	2	The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the inhabitants of the earth have become drunk on the wine of her harlotry. ”
NCB	Revelation	17	3	Then he carried me away in the spirit [ b ] into the wilderness , and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that had seven heads and ten horns and was covered with blasphemous names .
NCB	Revelation	17	4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls . In her hand she held a gold cup filled with accursed things and the impurities of her harlotry .
NCB	Revelation	17	5	On her forehead was written a mysterious name : “ Babylon the Great , the mother of harlots and of every abomination on the earth. ”
NCB	Revelation	17	6	And I noticed that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of those who had borne witness to Jesus . When I saw her , I was utterly astounded .
NCB	Revelation	17	7	But the angel said to me , “ Why are you astounded ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her .
NCB	Revelation	17	8	The beast that you saw was once alive but is now alive no longer . It is about to ascend from the abyss and go to its destruction . All the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast , because it was once alive but is now alive no longer , and yet it is still to come .

NCB	Revelation	17	15	) . She will drink the blood of Christians , especially during the terrible persecutions of Nero and Domitian . The beast that once was and now is not , but is returning—a parody of God who is described as “ hIm who is , who was , and who is to come ” ( Rev 1:4 ) —is probably Nero ( A.D. 54–68 ) , whose resurrection was predicted in some popular legends . And if the seven kings need to be identified ( vv . 9-11 ) , the list is as follows : Augustus , Tiberius , Caligula , Claudius , Nero , Vespasian , and Titus ( omitting Galba , Otho , and Vitellius , interim emperors , who ruled in quick succession in A.D. 68–69 , after the death of Nero ) . The eighth emperor acts as people would expect Nero to act if he returned to life , i.e. , as a beast ; we can give him a name : Domitian ( A.D. 81–96 ) , during whose reign the Book of Revelation was probably composed . The other ten kings ( v.

NCB	Revelation	17	18	The woman you saw is the great city that has authority over the kings of the earth. ” Footnotes - Revelation 17:1 Harlot and mother of harlots : such is Babylon because it is the wellspring of idolatry , especially by imposing emperor worship ; and for the people of the Bible an idol is an abomination , and idolatry is prostitution ( Ezek , chs .
NCB	Revelation	17	23	) . The woman on the beast is named Babylon , a name that stands for all oppressions and all sufferings ; the real reference is to imperial Rome , the famous city on the seven hills ( v.
NCB	Revelation	18	18	and exclaim as they see the smoke caused by her immolation , ‘ Has there ever been a city to compare with this great city ? ’
NCB	Revelation	18	1	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven . He had great authority , and his splendor illumined the earth .
NCB	Revelation	18	2	He cried out in a mighty voice : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the Great ! She has become a dwelling place for demons , a haunt for every unclean spirit and for every filthy and loathsome bird .
NCB	Revelation	18	3	For all the nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of her harlotry . The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from her wealth and luxury. ”
NCB	Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying : “ Depart from her , my people , so that you will not take part in her sins and share in her plagues .
NCB	Revelation	18	5	For her sins are piled up as high as the heavens , and God has remembered her crimes .
NCB	Revelation	18	6	Pay her back as she has done to others , and repay her double for her deeds ; mix her a double portion of her own poison .
NCB	Revelation	18	7	Give her torment and grief to equal the measure of her glory and luxury . In her heart she says , ‘ I rule as a queen . I am not a widow , and I will never experience grief. ’
NCB	Revelation	18	8	Therefore , in a single day her plagues will come upon her : pestilence and mourning and famine . And she will be consumed by fire , for mighty is the Lord God who judges her . Funereal Ode over Rome . [ b ]
NCB	Revelation	18	9	“ The kings of the earth who committed fornication with her and shared in her luxury will weep and mourn over her when they behold the smoke of her immolation .
NCB	Revelation	18	10	In terror at her torment , they will keep their distance and say : “ ‘ Woe , woe , O great city , mighty city of Babylon . In one hour your judgment has come. ’
NCB	Revelation	18	11	“ The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her , since no one buys their cargo anymore :
NCB	Revelation	18	12	their cargo of gold , silver , precious stones , and pearls ; purple and scarlet cloth , silks , and fine linens ; all sorts of fragrant wood and all kinds of objects of ivory , all kinds of objects of expensive wood , bronze , iron , and marble ;
NCB	Revelation	18	13	) —and the extraordinary accumulation of riches . - Revelation 18:24 You : the Greek has “ her . ”
NCB	Revelation	18	14	“ ‘ The fruit you longed for is no longer available to you . All your riches and splendor are gone , and you will never find them again. ’
NCB	Revelation	18	15	“ The merchants of these things who made a fortune from her will stand far off , weeping and mourning aloud , and terrified as they behold her torment :
NCB	Revelation	18	16	“ ‘ Woe , woe , O great city , clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet , adorned with gold , jewels , and precious stones !
NCB	Revelation	18	17	Within one hour all this wealth has been destroyed. ’ “ All the ship captains and voyagers , all the sailors and those who make their living by trading upon the sea , will stand far off
NCB	Revelation	18	19	Then they will throw dust on their heads and with mourning and weeping cry out : “ ‘ Woe , woe , O great city , where all who had ships at sea became rich through her wealth ! Within one hour she has been brought to ruin .
NCB	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , O heaven , you holy ones , apostles , and prophets ! For God has passed judgment on her for you. ’ ”
NCB	Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel picked up a stone the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea , saying : “ This is how the great city of Babylon will be thrown down , never to be found again .
NCB	Revelation	18	22	The sound of harpists and minstrels , flute players and trumpeters , will never be heard in you again . Craftsmen of every trade never will be found in you again . The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again .
NCB	Revelation	18	23	The light from a lamp will never be seen in you again . The voices of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again . Since your merchants were the world ’ s great men , all the nations were led astray by your enticements .
NCB	Revelation	18	24	In you [ c ] was found the blood of the Prophets , of the saints , and of all who have been slain on the earth. ” Footnotes - Revelation 18:1 The fall of Rome is described as if the empire were already collapsing . - Revelation 18:9 Drawing upon the laments of Ezekiel over the fall of Tyre ( Ezek 26–28 ) , the author greets the fall of Rome as already complete . This satire on the ruins of the empire also harbors , in its final lines , a tone of poignant complaint . The tableau nicely sketches the maritime grandeur of Rome , the development of commercial exchanges—without forgetting the traffic in slaves and prostitutes ( v.
NCB	Revelation	19	19	The Beast and the False Prophet . [ j ] Next I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one upon the horse and against his army .
NCB	Revelation	19	1	After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven , shouting : “ Alleluia ! [ b ] Salvation and glory and power belong to our God ,
NCB	Revelation	19	2	for true and just are his judgments . He has condemned the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her harlotry . And he has paid her back for the blood of his servants. ”
NCB	Revelation	19	3	Once again they shouted : “ Alleluia ! Her smoke will rise forever and ever. ”
NCB	Revelation	19	4	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures threw themselves to the ground and worshiped God who was seated on the throne , and they cried : “ Amen . Alleluia ! ”
NCB	Revelation	19	5	Then a voice came from the throne , saying : “ Praise our God , all you his servants , and all who fear him , small and great alike. ”
NCB	Revelation	19	6	And I heard what seemed to be the sound of a vast multitude , like the sound of a torrential stream or of great peals of thunder , crying out : “ Alleluia . The reign of the Lord our God , the Almighty , has begun .
NCB	Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory . For the wedding day of the Lamb has come , and the bride has made herself ready .
NCB	Revelation	19	8	She has been permitted to wear a bright and clean garment of fine linen. ” ( The fine linen represents the righteous deeds of the saints . )
NCB	Revelation	19	9	Then the angel said to me , “ Write : ‘ Blessed [ c ] are those who are invited to the wedding banquet of the Lamb. ’ ” And he added , “ These are the true words of God. ”
NCB	Revelation	19	10	I fell at his feet to worship him , but he said to me , “ You must not do that ! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brethren who have given witness to Jesus .

NCB	Revelation	19	11	The White Horse and the King of Kings . [ f ] Now I saw heaven opened , and a white horse appeared . Its rider was called “ Faithful and True , ” for with righteousness he judges and wages war .
NCB	Revelation	19	12	His eyes were like fiery flames , and on his head were many crowns . The name inscribed on him was known to no one but himself .
NCB	Revelation	19	13	.
NCB	Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven were following him , riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen , white and clean .
NCB	Revelation	19	15	Coming out of his mouth was a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations . He will rule them with an iron scepter , and he will tread the winepress [ g ] of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty .
NCB	Revelation	19	16	On his robe and on his thigh [ h ] he had a name inscribed : “ King of kings and Lord of lords. ”
NCB	Revelation	19	17	The Great Booty . [ i ] Then I saw an angel standing in the sun , and with a loud voice he cried out to all the birds flying in midair , “ Come here ! Gather together for the great supper of God ,
NCB	Revelation	19	18	to eat the flesh of kings , the flesh of commanders , and the flesh of warriors , the flesh of horses and their riders , the flesh of all , both free and slave , both small and great. ”
NCB	Revelation	19	20	The beast was captured , and with it the false prophet who in its presence had performed the signs by which he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped its image . These two were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur .
NCB	Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed by the sword that came forth from the mouth of the rider on the horse , and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh . Footnotes - Revelation 19:1 No other image could better evoke the fulfillment of all the expectations of believers than this vast heavenly liturgy and the vision of the wedding feast ( see Mt 22:1-14 ; 25:1-13 ) . The plea of the martyrs ( see Rev 6:9 ) has been heard ; the immense throng , along with the twenty-four elders and the four living beings , makes up the entire Church , reunited at last . The Kingdom of God reveals itself in all its reality . It is described as Christ ’ s marriage to the Church and as the complete manifestation of the Covenant , which is God ’ s ardent , jealous love for his people ( see Isa 54:1-8 ; Hos 2:16-18 ) and Christ ’ s nuptial love for his Church ( see Eph 5:23 ,
NCB	Revelation	19	25	,
NCB	Revelation	19	32	; see also Jn 3:29 ) . - Revelation 19:1 Alleluia : an important exclamation of praise in the Psalms that is found only here in the New Testament . It is derived from two Hebrew words meaning “ Praise the Lord. ” - Revelation 19:9 Blessed : the fourth beatitude ( see note on Rev 1:3 ) . - Revelation 19:10 Witness to Jesus : the proclamation that the predictions of the Prophets have been truly fulfilled . - Revelation 19:11 There now follows a new series of six tableaus , which the imagination projects onto the destiny of the world . Is it necessary then to foresee a new series of events in an ever more distant future ? And is the history of God ’ s judgments something that is forever beginning again ? The author has no intention of setting forth an indefinite series of calendars of the future . But before sketching the tableau of the new heaven and the new earth , he wishes one last time to interpret the drama of the world ; for he has at hand other materials , some of which greatly resemble those that he has already used . He organizes them to compose this rapid sequence : a powerful summary of the whole History of Salvation . It begins with Jesus and takes us well beyond the fall of Rome to the resurrection of the dead and the last judgment—a kind of tragic prelude whose contrast heightens the dazzling joy that will later inform the grand symphony of the heavenly Jerusalem . - Revelation 19:11 To describe the victory of Christ , the author uses the classic images of the warrior Messiah who establishes justice ( Isa 11:4 ) , annihilates hostile powers ( Isa 63:3 ) , subjects the nations ( Ps 2:9 ) , and traverses the world as the efficacious Word of God ( see Wis 18:14-18 ) . Through him justice reigns upon the world . He is the truthful and faithful one who fulfills God ’ s promise and makes his justice a reality . - Revelation 19:15 Will tread the winepress : the image was commonplace in the Prophets for symbolizing God ’ s destruction of the enemies of his people on the great day of his wrath ( see Gen 49:9-12 ; Isa 63:1-6 ; Jer 25:30 ; Joel 4:13 ) ; the wine is the blood of the enemies . - Revelation 19:16 Thigh : this should probably be “ standard ” ; the two words are quite similar in Hebrew and can be confused . King of kings and Lord of lords : see note on Rev 17:14 . - Revelation 19:17 In a final , gigantic combat , the forces of destruction will be annihilated ( see Rev 14:6-13 ) . This is the terrible sacrifice of which Ezekiel speaks ( 39:2 , 17-20 ) . - Revelation 19:19 The beast and the false prophet are thrown into the fiery lake and destroyed . The vision sums up in a single scene all the tableaus of the fall of Rome , and corresponds to that in Rev 14:14-20 . The beast , the false prophet , and the entire campaign aimed at imposing emperor worship are described in ch .

NCB	Revelation	20	1	Pet 1:17 and elsewhere . ) Everything is laid bare before the Lord—the same idea expressed in the symbol of books in Daniel ( 7:10 ) . There is another book—that of Life ; it contains the names of those who have resolutely chosen Christ in the face of idolatry and are now destined for glory ( see Rev 13:8 ; 17:8 ) . When one knows all that is represented by the concept of the netherworld , the sojourn of death and the power of death personified in the Bible , verse
NCB	Revelation	20	2	) . Then will be fulfilled the prophecy of Genesis ( 3:15 ) that in advance sketched the profound link of the drama of history and its end : the annihilation of the serpent , the personification of evil . A reign of a thousand years ? This passage has served as the basis of all the millenniarist interpretations , which await the coming of a political kingdom of Christ on earth . Must we at least imagine a first earthly accomplishment of the Kingdom of God before the final and eternal transformation ? But the author does not speak of a return of Christ in earthly conditions . He wants to affirm above all that those who have died as witnesses of Jesus are not separated from him while awaiting the full resurrection ( vv . 11-13 ) ; he also wishes to suggest that from now on believers have access to the tree of life in heaven—of which the figure “ one thousand ” may be a symbol—hence that they partake in the communion of God . In any case , the thousand-year reign is a symbolic representation , which thus prohibits all speculation . At best it evokes a length of time and a life of the Church beyond persecutions . But we must not forget that for God a thousand years are like one day ( see Ps 90:4 ) . - Revelation 20:4 A thousand years : early tradition took this verse literally : after a first real resurrection , that of the martyrs , Christ would return to earth and reign there for a thousand years . The Church has rejected this literal millenniarism . - Revelation 20:6 Blessed : the fifth beatitude ( see note on Rev 1:3 ) . The second death : eternal death , or damnation , which can not be followed by a resurrection . - Revelation 20:8 Ezekiel speaks of “ Gog , king of Magog. ” Here the two names symbolize the pagan nations gathered together against the Church at the end of the world . - Revelation 20:9 The earth is Palestine ; the beloved city is Jerusalem , a symbol of the Church . - Revelation 20:11 The earth and the sky disappear ; the first creation is abolished . Human beings alone remain , responsible toward God . - Revelation 20:12 This is a grandiose final sequence . As in Daniel ( 12:1-7 ) and Matthew ( 25:31-36 ) , all human beings appear before the tribunal of God and are judged according to their choices and life commitments . ( This principle of judgment according to one ’ s works is also found in Ps 62:12 ; Jer 17:10 ; Rom 2:6 ;

NCB	Revelation	20	4	Next , I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given the authority to judge . I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for bearing witness to Jesus and the word of God .

Footnotes - Revelation 20:1 The dragon is enchained for a thousand years in the abyss , the dwelling of the powers of evil ( see Rev 9:2 ) . This refers to Satan ’ s defeat when Jesus died and rose from the dead . The thousand year period means “ for a long time. ” Satan ’ s power is limited ( as if he is imprisoned for a long time ) . Yet he still tempts the holy ones on the earth during this period . - Revelation 20:4 While waiting for the History of Salvation to be completed , the witnesses to Christ ’ s love already reign with Jesus when they take up their crosses and follow Jesus . However , before the final triumph arrives—the great Judgment that one imagines must complete history—evil unleashes a last terrible assault on the Church , as envisaged by Ezekiel ( chs . 36–39 ) and Paul (

NCB	Revelation	21	18	[ l ] The wall was built of jasper , while the city itself was of pure gold , as bright as clear glass .

NCB	Revelation	21	27	However , nothing unclean will ever enter it , nor will anyone who does abominable or deceitful things , but only those who are written in the Lamb ’ s book of life . [ n ] Footnotes - Revelation 21:1 A new city for human beings descends from heaven , as beautiful as a new bride ; a new universe replaces the old ; life gushes up in floods , and an endless feast begins . How can we interpret these marvelous images ? We must let ourselves be captivated by the poetic evocation , by the incantation of this exciting symphony . We must project all the attention of people and the Church toward this meeting and this reconciliation , which we regard as the sole definitive condition for humankind—creating a mystical impetus toward Christ , a hope without frontiers . Let us then strive to highlight some themes that this vision overlaps on one another . At the end of the work of salvation , it is a new creation that God accomplishes ( v.
NCB	Revelation	21	87	;
NCB	Revelation	21	122	;
NCB	Revelation	21	137	; Isa 33:17-23 ) . One day this movement finds its accomplishment far beyond all warrior or political images . We can think of inexpressible repatriation of human beings in the friendship of God , joy , and happiness . The future city of God ’ s elect is no longer built up by force of arms—it is a gift and grace coming from on high ; it is nothing less than splendor ( Rev 21:15-21 ) . There is no more need of institutions and signs for worship—the temple itself is surpassed : the risen Jesus is the sole place where may be found the joy of really and directly encountering God ( see Heb 9:11 ; Jn 2:21 ) . What extraordinary and joyous celebration in the eternal face-to-face vision of the Lord ! - Revelation 21:1 The sea , the usual dwelling of the dragon and a symbol of evil , will disappear before the victorious march of the new Israel , as it did in the days of the Exodus , but this time for good . - Revelation 21:3 This verse contains a combination of the classic formula of the Covenant ( “ You will be my people , and I will be your God ” ) and the name Immanuel ( “ God-with-us ” ) , which was regarded as a name of the Messiah ( Mt 1:23 ) —a fine assertion of the divinity of Christ , who is God and man . The complete and definitive Covenant between God and humankind will be accomplished at the end of time ( see Isa 12:6 ; Joel 4:17 ,

NCB	Revelation	22	1	Cor 16:22 ) . The Church should ceaselessly strive to recover this fervent expectation for the one in whom she has placed her faith , her hope , and her love , the one from whom she awaits all things . The New Testament is not a book that one can close upon itself . It is the charter of the Covenant , the Good News from which one must live . It remains open toward its fulfillment : on the last page we have the beautiful and ancient liturgical prayer of Christians : “ Come , Lord Jesus ! ”

NCB	Revelation	22	6	These serve to exhort the readers to take this whole revelation seriously . They should realize that they are living at the decisive moment and so fix their attention on the Lord who is coming ! - Revelation 22:7 I am coming soon : the speaker is Christ . Blessed : the sixth beatitude ( see note on Rev 1:3 ) . - Revelation 22:10 The history of humankind continues up to the return of Christ . We must take his part and be polarized by the idea of a definitive lot , by the expectation of Life and Light , by the joyous certitude of the Elect . The author draws here on Ps 62:13 and Isa 40:10 ; 41:4 ; 44:6 . - Revelation 22:14 Blessed : the seventh beatitude ( see note on Rev 1:3 ) . - Revelation 22:15 Dogs : they were regarded as despicable creatures ; when the term was applied to people it referred to all types of ceremonially unclean persons and also to people of low moral character : e.g. , male prostitutes ( Deut 23:18 ) and unfaithful leaders ( Isa 56:10 ) . - Revelation 22:16 At its beginning , the Book of Revelation took the form of a letter ( Rev 1:4 ) . Now it ends with the classic salutation of a letter—but a salutation preceded by a threat to forgers , who would otherwise be at ease in the exploitation of apocalyptic writings . - Revelation 22:16 The Root and the Offspring of David : see note on Rev 1:5 ; see also Isa 11:1 ,
